"Brazilian police have detained one man and were seeking two others in the killing of a referee who was gruesomely quartered and beheaded after fatally stabbing a player on the field during a match. Officer Valter Costa, who was heading the investigation into the June 30 slayings, said police have detained Luis Moraes Souza, 27, who is suspected of pummeling the referee over the head and smashing a bottle of cachaca sugarcane rum onto his face. Souza's brother, Francisco, is among the two still being sought, Costa said. Beheaded: 20-year-old soccer referee Octavio da Silva Catanhede Jordan was quartered and beheaded after fatally stabbing a player during a match last Sunday . Perpetrators: Police in Brazil have already arrested one man suspected of beheading the referee, but are still look for two others associated with the act . Fatally stabbed: Josenir dos Santos Abreu died on the way to the ambulance after being supposedly stabbed by referee Catanhede Jordan . The match took place June 30 at Pius XII stadium in Maranhao, northeastern Brazil. The slayings began after the . 20-year-old referee, Otavio Jordao da Silva, expelled player Josemir . Santos Abreu, 31, from an amateur match in the small town of Centro do . Meio, in the northern state of Maranhao. Angered by the expulsion, Abreu threw . Silva to the ground. As he rose, Silva pulled a knife and stabbed Abreu . in the chest, Costa said, and the player died on the way to the . hospital. Players and spectators then rushed . Silva, tying him up by his arms and legs while Souza hit him over the . head with a spike and then broke the bottle on his face. One of the . suspects being sought, a man nicknamed 'Pirolo,' then took the knife . that had been used to stab Abreu and stabbed the referee in the neck, . said Costa. It was not immediately clear why Silva had been carrying the knife in the first place. Souza's brother Francisco then used a . sickle to cut off Silva's arms, legs and head, which he placed on a . spike in the middle of the field, Costa said. He added that Francisco . may have been on drugs at the time. The mob showed no mercy as they quartered and decapitated the referee and then placed his head on a stake. Arrested: Police in Maranhao have already brought into custody Luis Moraes Souza in relation to the beheading, but are on the lookout for two other men . Costa said violence was unusual in . Centro de Meio, a remote rural community with little crime. He said . those involved in the slayings were all from neighboring towns. While violent clashes between rival . fans is common in Brazil, the brutality of the killings in Centro de . Meio sent shockwaves through Brazil, which last month played host to the . Confederations Cup and is gearing up to host next year's World Cup . soccer tournament. Paulo Storani, a professor and . security expert who spent three decades in Rio's police forces, called . the slayings 'an isolated incident' and said they don't reflect on . Brazil's ability to ensure security at during the World Cup. 'It's something that's completely out . of the ordinary which took place in an isolated area of the poorest . state in the country, an area where violence is very widespread,' said . Storani. 'While it's true we are used to soccer violence in Brazil, this . is completely off the charts of what we usually see.' A video shows the damage the mob did to Catanhede Jordan, but it is exceptionally graphic. Valter Costa, police chief of Santa Ines, released a statement about the investigation. 'Reports . of witnesses have indicated some people that were in place at the time . of the fact,' he said. 'We will identify and hold accountable all those . involved. A crime will never justify another. Actions like this do not . collaborate with the legality of a state law.'","The match took place June 30 in Maranhao, Brazil .

"Britain is less able to keep track of its visitors than Disney World, it was claimed last night, as a scathing report exposed the failings of official immigration statistics. Crucial estimates of arrivals from overseas rely on random interviews carried out with just 12 people passing through ports and airports each day – and even they may be lying, MPs said. Ministers were warned they should not base their controversial immigration target – to limit population growth to the tens of thousands every year – on such shaky figures. Failings: The risk of error in the random interviewing system is so great that annual migration could be 35,000 higher or lower than is estimated . The Public Administration Select Committee urged the Home Office to combine its visa figures with forthcoming electronic data on visitors to build up a far more accurate picture of foreigner numbers. Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin said: ‘Most people would be astonished to learn that there is no attempt to count people as they enter or leave the UK. ‘They are amazed when they are told that the Government merely estimates that there are half-a-million immigrants coming into the UK each year.’ Philippa Roe, leader of Westminster City Council, said: ‘When I gave evidence to this committee  I said Disney World has better technology to keep track of its visitors than we do. I’m pleased this report accepts the current system is a blunt instrument which is patently not up to the job.’ The Coalition vowed to cut net migration – the number of new arrivals each year minus those who leave the country – from more than 150,000 a year to the ‘tens of thousands’ by granting fewer visas to foreign students and making it harder for families to settle here. Unimpressed: Councillor Philippa Roe said 'Disney World has better technology' But today’s report reveals that the policy and the figures are not based on methodically counting everyone who arrives in the country or leaves it. Instead, officials rely on a sample of just under 5,000 migrants interviewed each year as they travel through UK air and sea ports, in what is known as the International Passenger Survey. The risk of error in this  poll is so great that annual net migration could be 35,000 higher or lower than is estimated. Some advisers believe that, as a result, the Government should aim to reduce net migration to 50,000 rather than 100,000 in order to achieve its goal. But the committee warned: ‘The Government should not base its target level of net migration on such an uncertain statistic as doing so could lead to inappropriate immigration policy.’ The passenger survey also relies on immigrants telling the truth about where they have come from and where they plan to settle. A new system called e-Borders will record more detail on the identity of passengers travelling through British ports. But it will not be integrated into immigration statistics until 2018. The Home Office counts the number of visas issued and asylum applications granted or received – but not people leaving unless they have broken the rules. The committee urged Ministers to integrate visa figures with port data ‘as rapidly as possible’. Last night a Home Office spokesman said: ‘We disagree with the report’s conclusions. Government reforms on immigration are working and the statistics show that migration is at its lowest level for a decade.’ Oddly quiet: Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . Yvette Cooper has been criticised by Labour MPs for refusing to condemn a controversial new poster campaign telling illegal immigrants to ‘go home’. Ethnic minority MPs in the party say Ms Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary,  was asked to speak out but declined. They said it was ‘embarrassing’ that attacks on the campaign were then led by UKIP’s Nigel Farage, who described the posters as ‘nasty and unpleasant’. Labour MPs also accused Ms Cooper, below, of making a ‘misguided’ attempt to ‘pander to the Right’. The giant billboards, which are being driven around on the back of vans, say: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.’ Illegal immigrants are offered a number to text for ‘free advice and help with travel documents’. Reaction from the Liberal Democrats, backbench Labour MPs and UKIP was swift and critical. But Ms Cooper remained quiet. One Labour MP said last night: ‘We hoped she would come out strongly against this nasty campaign, but she didn’t want to. ‘It is ridiculous if we are  so worried about alienating Right-wing voters that we end up being outflanked on the Left by Farage, the most Right-wing party leader, in a misguided attempt to pander to his supporters.’ Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron condemned the billboards as the ‘politics of division’. And Mr Farage,  who campaigns on an anti-immigration ticket, said:  ‘I think the tone of the billboards is nasty, unpleasant, Big Brother.’ A Labour spokesman insisted that one of Ms Cooper’s frontbench team had criticised the poster campaign. Taxpayers are shelling out  £21 million a year to fund interpreters for NHS hospital patients who cannot speak English, The Mail on Sunday has discovered. The amount has shot up by 50 per cent – £7 million – in just five years, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Five years ago each hospital trust was on average spending £87,000 on interpreters, but by last year that had grown to £130,000. Large-scale immigration from Eastern European countries, in particular Poland, appears to have driven the massive demand for interpreters. Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of pressure group Migration Watch, said: ‘I am a first-generation immigrant myself. Those arriving here need to make much more of an effort to  learn the language.’","Councillor Philippa Roe from Westminster City Council told the Government: ‘Disney .

"The Centers for Disease Control is blaming dirty endoscopes used by hospitals for last year’s Illinois superbug outbreak. Authorities say the 44 people infected with the dangerous bacteria in northeastern Illinois came into contact with it because exam tools were not completely disinfected. The patients were infected with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a family of germs highly resistant to antibiotics, according to NBC News. Outbreak: Dirty endoscopy tools are being blamed for a rash of superbug infections last year in Illinois . A CDC official told NBC that the infections were rare a rare form of CRE that actually produces an enzyme countering the effects of most antibiotics – greatly increasing the risk of death in those infected. A total of 69 cases of CRE infection occurred, last year, a sharp increase from the 27 total infections from 2009 to 2012, according to Dr. Alex Kallen, a CDC outbreak expert. ‘It was a little bit of a surprise,’ he told NBC. The dirty tools were found to have been used on patients who were prone to ERCP exams of the liver and pancreas, NBC noted. The endoscopes fingered as the culprits in the outbreak were all snaked through the patient's mouth to their gut and on to the organs to be examined. They not only tested positive for CRE, but also for a form of pneumoniae resistant to most antibiotics. Hospital staff were found to have followed disinfection and cleaning procedures recommended by the CDC. Officials blamed a design flaw on them not being completely disinfected. The Illinois hospital found to be the root of at least eight cases of the superbug changed its sterilization technique, NBC reported. No new cases have been reported since.","At least 69 people were infected with a deadly strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria last year .

"A man killed his wife in self defence when she approached him in the form of an evil apparition, a court heard. Ahmed Al-Khatib, 35, claims mother-of-three Rania Alayed, 25, appeared as a djinn - an apparition in Muslim belief - commanding him to bury her body. Believing he was going to be killed, Al-Khatib pushed Miss Alayed, who hit her head and fell unconscious, the jury was told. Ahmed Al-Khatib (left) claims 25-year-old Rania Alayed (right) appeared as an apparition telling him to kill her . Following the djinn's orders, he took the body from his brother's flat in Salford to a grave dug between trees near to the A19 in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, the court heard. The body of Syrian-born Miss Alayed has still not been found 10 months on from the incident on June 7 last year. Al-Khatib claims a partial defence of diminished responsibility. Tony Cross QC, prosecuting, said: 'The . defendant accepts he was responsible for the death of his wife Rania . but he insists it was not his intention to harm his wife. 'He . had been mentally unwell at that time with paranoia manifested in . auditory and visual hallucinations, with a djinn - an evil apparition . speaking to the defendant. 'Immediately . prior to the death of his wife the defendant began to see his wife in . the form of a djinn. This vision terrified him and advanced towards him. Police descended on a house on Knutsford Road in Gorton, Manchester, on July 4 last year where Ahmed Khatib was charged with murder following the disappearance of mother-of-three Rania Alayed . After Khatib was arrested he told psychiatrists she died after he pushed her during a row whilst 'possessed of spirit.' He claimed he pushed her, causing her to stumble, fall and bang her head, the court heard . 'The . defendant believed he was going to be killed and pushed her back. His . wife struck her head against a mirror or a piece of furniture and she . was rendered unconscious and then realised she was dead. 'The . defendant will say he was acting in self defence in pushing his wife, . the djinn, away. There had been several occasions when he had seen his . wife as a djinn. 'He said he was commanded to bury her. He dug a grave between some trees and buried her not far from the dual carriageway. 'The prosecution do not accept that the defendant’s mental responsibility was diminished at all.' Arthur Millwood Court, the Salford home of Ahmed Khatib's brother Muhaned, where Ahmed claims he saw the 'djinn' He said that the defendant had been seen by a number of psychiatrists and reports were submitted about his behaviour. Today . Al-Khatib had to be physically restrained after he lunged to put his . hands around the neck of an interpreter after the prosecution claimed . facts were being 'made up'. Yesterday proceedings were delayed when Al-Khatib began banging his head against the glass of the dock. Manchester Crown Court was told Miss Alayed had left Al-Khatib after years of domestic violence. On June 7 last year, he lured her to spend a weekend together without the children at the home of his 38-year-old brother Muhaned Al-Khatbi, it was said. Her brother-in-law left the address with the children some 45 minutes . later and shortly after her husband walked out wearing her clothing, . including jeans and headscarf. Ms Alayed’s body was in a suitcase . which was later moved to Muhaned Al-Khatib’s motorhome that travelled . towards the North East in the early hours of the next day. The . prosecution say the marriage was 'marred by violence' from Ahmed . Al-Khatib and that Ms Alayed had left him after years of serious . domestic violence. They had fled the Middle East to 'a place of . safety' in England and settled in the Middlesbrough area before moving . to Manchester in 2009. She feared for her life and had sought help . from the Citizens Advice Bureau, the police and eventually a solicitor . which had angered her husband’s family, the court heard. Earlier the jury was told that . telephone, Facebook and message services were deployed to pretend to . others that Ms Alayed was still alive, the court heard. Mr . Cross said: 'They did not though fool Rania Alayed’s real friends. They . slipped into using language she would never have used and they became . suspicious.' One particular 'callous and calculating' ruse was devised to make it appear as if the mother-of-three was in Turkey. Muhaned Al-Khatib was said to have persuaded a friend to forward a text message to the victim’s father. It read: 'My beloved father, I know you are upset by me. 'I am in Turkey. I have been here a few days. 'Ahmed has divorced me and I am going to remarry someone. 'I know you are upset with me but I am sorry.' Denies murder: Ahmed Khatib, pictured with his arm on a horse. The 33-year-old and his brother both deny murder but admit perverting the course of justice by transporting and concealing Miss Alayed's body . The trial at Manchester Crown Court, which started yesterday, is expected to last for up to five weeks . Ahmed Al-Khatib was arrested on July 4 and made no complaint of any mental illness, the court heard. He . told police the relationship had been trouble free until January last . year when his wife rang police about a row when he had taken her phone. He said he had seen pictures of his wife in underwear. Detectives . were told he had not seen her since April and he had tried to contact . her 30 times but believed her to be in Turkey or Syria. Mr . Cross told the jury: 'Quite plainly, ladies and gentlemen, the majority . of these facts were lies. He knew full well. He had killed her.' The next day Muhaned Al-Khatib told police that Miss Alayed was not alive and she was buried at the side of a layby on the A19. He . denied helping his brother to bury her or murder her and said he had . not seen her body.The court heard he agreed to show police where her . grave was but the location could not be found. Mr . Cross said DNA from the third defendant, Hussain Al-Khatib, was linked . to a pair of scissors found in the motorhome - said to have been used to . cut up the suitcase. Ahmed Al-Khatib, from Gorton, and Muhaned Al-Khatib, of . Salford, both deny murder but pleaded guilty to . intending to pervert the course of justice by transporting and . concealing the body of Ms Alayed. A third brother, Hussain Al-Khatib, 34, of Knutsford Road, Gorton, denies the latter charge. The trial is estimated to last up to five weeks.

Horn, a father-of-three, from Gillingham, was arrested by Kent Police on Thursday afternoon and is currently being held in custody. Horn, who is reported to have links with the English Defence League, is also alleged to have publicly supported Breivik’s crusade to 'protect his country from Muslims'. The unemployed builder from Gillingham, Kent, is said to have posted a message saying: 'Well done Anders Breivik. I take my hat off to you sir. 'You proved you were not insane and that you are just one of many like myself who wish their country to return to the way it was before it was invaded by the Muslim population. Respect to you.' He was also filmed by a national newspaper saying: 'If someone came to my door in a uniform and said they were going to bang me up for six months then fine.

"Comer Cottrell, a black-hair-care entrepreneur who brought Jheri curl to the masses, has died. He made millions with a cheap kit that made the glossy hairstyle, popularized by celebrities such as Michael Jackson, available to average African Americans. Mr Cottrell, who was 82, died October 3 at his home in Plano, Texas, family spokeswoman Taryn Brown said Thursday. Beautiful life: Comer Cottrell (pictured in 2007), the entrepreneur who brought Jheri curl to the masses, has died at age 82 . Mr Cottrell recalled there was a lack of hair-care products for black servicemen while he was managing an Air Force base exchange in Okinawa, Japan, in the 1950s. With $600, Cottrell founded Pro-Line Corp. in downtown Los Angeles in 1970.  Military bases were his first customers. Sales ballooned after Pro-Line introduced the Curly Kit in 1980 and later the Kiddie Kit for youngsters. Mane man: Mr Cottrell, pictured in 1886, made millions with a cheap kit that made the glossy celebrity hairstyle available to average African Americans . Entrepreneur: With $600, Cottrell (seen in an undated photo) founded Pro-Line Corp. in downtown Los Angeles in 1970, and the company introduced the Curly Kit in 1980 . An at-home product, Curly Kit allowed people to reproduce the loose, shiny Jheri curl hairstyle invented by Jheri Redding and popularized by Michael Jackson, Rick James and other performers. The Curly Kit sold for around $8 at barbershops, beauty parlors and drugstores while the salon price for a Jheri curl might run to $300. Cottrell 'democratized the Jheri curl,' said Lori L. Tharps, co-author of Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America. Star power: Celebrities such as Michael Jackson (pictured in 1984) popularized the Jheri curl . Popular trend: Lionel Ritchie, pictured in 1982 with Debbie Reynolds (left) and Debbie Allen (right), also sported the hairstyle . 'You couldn't find a black person in America in their 30s or 40s who didn't have a Curly Kit or Kiddie Kit at some time in their childhood or adulthood,' and its popularity helped drive company sales up from $1 million to $10 million, Tharps told the Los Angeles Times. The Jheri curl's ubiquity in black communities was lampooned in pop culture. The 1988 comedy Coming to America featured a fictional product called 'Soul Glo,' which gave users a shiny hairstyle and left a greasy stain on furniture. With his brother, James, Mr Cottrell turned Pro-Line into one of the most successful black-owned companies in the United States. The company moved to Dallas and had grown to include multinational sales before it was sold to Alberto Culver for $80 million in 2000.

He was the first African American member of the powerful Dallas Citizens Council and helped pave the way for the election of the city's first black mayor, Ron Kirk, in 1995. A Republican, he and George W. Bush were part-owners of the Texas Rangers. Mr Cottrell was the first African American to own a stake in a Major League Baseball team, which he held from 1989 to 1998.

"The debate that has raged about whether Neanderthals were a sub-species of modern humans may finally be over. Researchers have identified new evidence supporting the growing belief that Neanderthals were a distinct species separate from modern humans (Homo sapiens) and deserve a more distinct identity of their own. Experts studied the nasal complex of Neanderthals to also conclude that their extinction was probably due to competition with modern humans, and not their inability to adapt to a cooling climate. Experts studied the nasal complex of Neanderthals (a skull dating from 50,000 BC is pictured) and say that its features evolved separately to modern humans, suggesting that Neanderthals were a distinct species separate from Homo sapiens and deserve a more distinct identity of their own . The research, led by Suny Downstate Medical Centre, in New York City, indicates that the Neanderthal nasal complex was not inferior, but simply different, to that of modern humans. Samuel Márquez, Associate Professor at the Centre’s Department of Cell Biology and his team said that previous studies into the Neanderthal nose have compared Neanderthal nasal dimensions to modern human populations such as the Inuit and modern Europeans, whose nasal complexes are adapted to cold and temperate climates. However, the current study, published in The Anatomical Record, adds to a growing body of evidence that the upper respiratory tracts of this extinct group functioned via a different set of rules. This is because the structures have as a separate evolutionary history and features not found among any population of humans. Dr Márquez explained: ‘The strategy was to have a comprehensive examination of the nasal region of diverse modern human population groups and then compare the data with the fossil evidence. The study revealed that the extinction of Neanderthals was probably due to competition with modern humans, not their inability to adapt to a cooling climate. A hunting scene is illustrated . A genome taken from a 36,000-year-old skeleton has shed new light on the period of interbreeding between humans and Neanderthals. The study of DNA recovered from a fossil of one of the earliest known Europeans - a man who lived in Russia - shows that the genes of the earliest inhabitants of the continent survived the Ice Age, helping sow the seed for the modern-day population. The Kostenki genome revealed a small percentage of Neanderthal genes, confirming previous results that found Neanderthals and the first humans to leave Africa for Europe, briefly interbred. Lead author Dr Eske Willerslev, of the Centre for GeoGenetics at Copenhagen University, said the work reveals a framework with which to explore how humans responded to climate change, encounters with other populations, and the dynamic landscapes of the Ice Age, for the first time. The study allows scientists to more accurately estimate when interbreeding occurred - around 54,000 years ago. Experts think that a ‘meta-population’ of hunter-gatherers with deep shared ancestry managed to survive through the last Ice Age and colonise the landmass of Europe for more than 30,000 years. ‘We used traditional morphometrics, geometric morphometric methodology based on 3D coordinate data, and CT imaging.’ Anthony Pagano, anatomy instructor at NYU Langone Medical Centre, who co-authored the study, collected 3D data from fossils in European museums. The team looked at this data and other sets of information to ‘have a feel for where these Neanderthals may lie among the human spectrum’. William Lawson, director of the Palaeorhinology Laboratory of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, also in New York City, said that while the external nasal aperture (the pear-shaped opening of the skull) of Neanderthals is similar to that of some human populations, their protrusion of the midface (midfacial prognathism) is ‘startlingly different’. That difference is one of a number of Neanderthal nasal traits suggesting an evolutionary development distinct from that of modern humans. Jeffrey Laitman, of the Icahn School of Medicine, believes that the study is a significant contribution to the question of Neanderthal cold adaptation in the nasal region, especially in its identification of a different number of features than those of cold-adapted modern humans. His previous work has shown that there are clear differences in the vocal tract proportions of fossil humans when compared to modern humans. He said: ‘The strength of this new research lies in its taking the totality of the Neanderthal nasal complex into account, rather than looking at a single feature. ‘By looking at the complete morphological pattern, we can conclude that Neanderthals are our close relatives, but they are not us.’ Ian Tattersall, of the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study commented: ‘Márquez and colleagues have carried out a most provocative and intriguing investigation of a very significant complex in the Neanderthal skull that has all too frequently been overlooked.’ He hopes that future studies will demonstrate ‘once and for all’ that Neanderthals deserve a distinctive identify of their own.","Anthropologists studied the nasal complex of Neanderthals .

"For most men, giving a father of the bride speech is one of the proudest moments of their lives. But after IT consultant Irving Caplan was paralysed in a cycling accident, he feared he may have to address guests at his daughter's wedding from a wheelchair. However, thanks to the latest in robotic technology, the 55-year-old walked across the dance floor of a wedding venue last month and delivered his speech standing up. Scroll down for video . Tetraplegic Irving Caplan shocked guests at his daughter's wedding by crossing the floor using bionic legs and standing to make his father of the bride speech . His daughter Joanne said it was the 'moment of the wedding' after Mr Caplin borrowed the device for the day . Mr Caplan, from Stanmore, Middlesex, broke three vertebrae when he collided with a lorry in Edgware, north-west London on his morning cycle to work two years ago. After undergoing a series of operations and spending 12 days in intensive care, he was left tetraplegic and needing a wheelchair to get around. When his daughter Joanne announced she was to marry fiancé Mike Beaumont, Mr Caplan feared he would be unable to walk his daughter down the aisle or deliver his speech standing up. But after he and wife Karen, 57, met a representative of Rex Bionics at an exhibition of technologies for the disabled, he was lent the robotic suit to allow him to stand and walk. The legs contain 29 computer processors which communicate 3,000 a messages a second to each other . The motors can carry a person weighing up to 15 stone have been used by 50 people, clocking up 4,000 hours of walking. They are currently estimated at costing £97,000 but makers believe they can get the price down to £40,000. The benefits are not confined to the mobility of users, as the upright position also reduces the risks of users developing other health problems. They are currently being tested by the US military in rehabilitation centres for wounded servicemen. He told MailOnline: 'The guests were gobsmacked when I walked out. It was the usual speech, thanking everyone for coming and hoping everybody had a good evening, but I certainly surprised them all with my entrance. 'It wasn't possible for a number of reasons for me to walk Joanne down the aisle, but I was able to do my speech standing up. 'It is quite an issue when you end up in a wheelchair, being at the wrong height compared to everybody else. But being able to speak to everybody from the right height did make quite a difference. 'It made a difference to me in the sense that I was doing it from the right perspective. 'The day was wonderful. It was everything you would hope your daughter's wedding day to be. Unfortunately I could not do everything I would have wanted to do, but this certainly helped.' Mr Caplan made the three-minute, 30-pace walk across the hall of Sopwell House, St Albans last month to gasps from guests, who had no idea what he had planned. Joanne, 29, said: 'I knew what he was going to do but the only times he had tried it before, I had been at work, so it was still very emotional to see him walk across the room. 'It was important to him to be able to do as much at the wedding as he would have been able to do before he had the accident, so it was amazing. 'Most of the guests knew him pre-accident and post-accident and for them it was pretty emotional too because it is nice to see him upright and at the same level as you.' Wedding organisers played a soundtrack of Walking on the Moon, Walking Back to Happiness and You'll Never Walk Alone, and Mr Caplan said: 'There wasn't a dry eye in the house'. Mr Caplan said the bionic legs made a huge difference to his experience of his daughter's big day . The 'exoskeleton suit', which is controlled by a joystick and a series of computers and motors, was lent to Mr Caplan for the day. Mr Caplan added: 'There are a number similar technologies being developed and they are all in very early stages. 'It is worth about £97,000 so it is not something I could just stick on the credit card or be able to afford any time soon, but it made a big difference.' Brian Carlin, of charity Aspire, who Mr Caplan supports, said: 'Irving Caplan has been a supporter of Aspire since he was paralysed by a spinal cord injury in 2012 and we would like to congratulate him and his family on his daughter's wedding. 'One of our services is to provide adapted houses for spinal injured people to live in whilst they find suitable accessible accommodation. Irving Caplan lived in an Aspire House in London from April 2013 to March 2014 and since then has been a supporter of the charity, raising over £2,000.'","Irving Caplan was paralysed in a cycling accident in London in 2012 .

"An Oregon woman accused of beating her 4-year-old son to death believed the boy was gay and that was a motive behind the murder, according to the prosecution. Jessica Dutro's son Zachary died in August 2012, days after collapsing at the homeless shelter where his family was living southwest of Portland. Washington County Judge Don Letourneau ruled Wednesday, after jurors were released for the day, that a Facebook message from Dutro to her boyfriend was admissible evidence. On trial: Jessica Dutro (left) is accused of beating her 4-year-old son to death with the help of her boyfriend, Brian Canady (right), because she thought the toddler was gay . Crime scene: Zachary Dutro-Boggess was found unconscious August 14, 2012, in the homeless shelter Good Neighbor Center in Tigard, Oregon . In the message, Dutro told her boyfriend, Brian Canady, that Zachary was 'facing the wall' because he had made her angry. Her son was going to be gay, she wrote, using a slur. 'He walks and talks like it. Ugh.' Canady would have to 'work on' Zachary, she wrote. The message established Dutro's motive for inflicting a pattern of abuse, prosecutor Megan Johnson said. Dutro assaulted three of her children, but Zachary received the harshest treatment, authorities said. The judge ruled additional web searches done by Dutro were also admissible, The Oregonian reported. On August 16, 2012, the day her son was taken off life support, Miss Dutro searched terms such as anger management and parenting classes, prosecutors said. She also searched listings for free stuff and sex with strangers, they said. Earlier this month, Canady pleaded guilty to manslaughter and assault for his role in the homicide. Zachary Dutro-Boggess died of blunt-force trauma to his abdomen and a delay in medical treatment, prosecutors said. Dutro, 25, is charged with murder, murder by abuse and second-degree assault. Admission of guilt: Brian Canady (center) pleaded guilty to manslaughter and assault earlier this month. He has now been sentenced to 12 and a half years prison . On August 14, 2012, Jessica Dutro and her boyfriend called 911 to report that her son was unconscious after collapsing at Good Neighbor Center, a family homeless shelter. Little Zachary, who just turned four the day before, was rushed to a Portland hospital where doctors diagnosed him with blunt-force trauma to the abdomen, which caused his bowels to tear. The toddler was taken off the ventilator two days later. On March 4, Brian Canady, 24, pleaded guilty to manslaughter for his role in Zachary's death and agreed to testify against Dutro as a witness for the prosecution. Under the plea agreement, the more serious charges against him, including four counts of murder by abuse and one count of second-degree assault, have been dropped. When questioned by detectives, the man admitted that he had kicked Zachary in the stomach because the boy wanted to take off his shoes before sitting down to watch TV, as Canady had ordered him. During a hearing Tuesday, the jury got to hear an audio recording of an interview that detectives had conducted with Miss Dutro's 7-year-old daughter, who described how her mother and Canady allegedly hit and punched Zachary until he 'got dead.' The girl also told police that the couple often hit her and her siblings for 'not being good.' The 7-year-old recounted how her brother was repeatedly struck by his parents for not listening until he got sick. Plea deal: Canady has agreed to testify against his girlfriend in exchange for the more serious charges against him being dropped . The boy eventually stopped breathing, but his sister told police that Dutro and her boyfriend 'didn’t tell anybody.' On the morning of August 14, Dutro placed Zachary in the shower because he had wet himself, but the child's body was limp and his eyes rolled. Dr. Danny Leonhardt, who examined Zachary, testified that by the time his parents sought medical help for the toddler, he 'essentially was dead.' Leonhardt said that the contents of his torn intestines had leaked out into his body for at least two days, resulting in a deadly infection. Besides the injuries to Zachary’s abdomen similar to those seen in car crash victims, the child's body was covered in bruises suggesting prolonged, repeated abuse. Leonhardt said that in the hospital, he caught a glimpse of Zachary's 3-year-old brother and said that the child's face was covered in scrapes. An exam later showed that the toddler had five broken ribs in various stages of healing. The physician evaluated the victim’s siblings and concluded that all of them had been abused, save for Dutro and Canady's infant son.","Jessica Dutro, 25, charged with murder in August 2012 death of her son Zachary Dutro-Boggess .

"Google smartphones with next-generation 3D sensing technology are about to blast into orbit, where they will become the brains and eyes of ball-shaped hovering robots on the International Space Station. NASA plans to use the handsets to beef up its Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites, or spheres, which could eventually take over daily chores for astronauts or even handle risky duties outside of the vessel. The phones, part of Google's Project Tango augmented reality initiative, will be aboard a cargo spacecraft scheduled to launch on July 11. Scroll down for video . Nasa plans to use Android handsets to beef up its Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites, or spheres, which could eventually take over daily chores for astronauts or even handle risky duties outside of the vessel. Smart SPHERES project manager Chris Provencher demonstrates one of NASA's robots which will be powered by Google smartphones with next-generation 3D sensing technology . The current prototype is a 5-inch phone containing customised hardware and software designed to track the full 3D motion of the device, while simultaneously creating a map of the environment. These sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3D measurements every second, updating it’s position and orientation in real-time. It then combines that data into a single 3D model of the space around the user. The technology could be used to capture the dimensions of a person's home simply by walking around the table. Directions to a new location could continue beyond a street address into a building that had been mapped by someone else. Project Tango could also be used by the visually-impaired to navigated unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places. Or, when shopping, the tablet could be used to find the exact shelf a project is located on. Google also highlights some of the gaming aspects, such as playing hide-and-seek with a virtual character. Inspired by a scene from the movie Star Wars where Luke Skywalker spars with a hovering globe, the soccer-ball sized robots can be guided around the space station's microgravity interior, propelled by tiny blasts of CO2 at about an inch per second. When Nasa sent its SPHERES to the space station in 2006 they were capable of precise movement but little else. In 2010, engineers at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, looked for ways to make the devices smarter. 'We wanted to add communication, a camera, increase the processing capability, accelerometers and other sensors. 'As we were scratching our heads thinking about what to do, we realized the answer was in our hands,' Smart spheres project manager Chris Provencher told Reuters in an interview last week. 'Let's just use smartphones.' Nasa's robo-helpers floating on the ISS: This week they will get an upgrade giving them 3D vision . They bought phones at Best Buy and altered them by adding extra batteries and a shatter-proof displays before sending the handsets to the space station, where astronauts used Velcro to attach them to the side of the Spheres. That gave the robots a wealth of new sensing and visual capabilities - but still not enough to move around the station as easily as the engineers wanted. Looking to improve the robots, NASA recently turned to the experimental smartphones Google created to encourage innovation in its push for consumer mobile devices that can make sense of space as easily as people do. The Project Tango handsets include a motion-tracking camera and an infrared depth sensor similar to Microsoft's Kinect add-on for the Xbox. The sensors will detect sharp angles inside the space station and create a 3D map that lets the spheres navigate from one module to another. 'This type of capability is exactly what we need for a robot that's going to do tasks anywhere inside the space station,' Provencher said. 'It has to have a very robust navigation system.'NASA's phones have been split open so that the touchscreen and sensors face outward when mounted on the robots. They also include space-tested batteries and plastic connectors to replace the Velcro. Project Tango was first announced for phones back in Feburary, but is now being rolled out to about 4,000 prototype tablets for early adopters this month. The process for getting one of the development kit laptops is likely to be similar to how Google Glass was rolled out last year . Google wants the technology showcased by Project Tango to become ubiquitous, helping retailers create detailed 3D representations of their shops and letting gamers make their homes into virtual battlegrounds. It also teamed up with LG recently to launch a Project Tango tablet to encourage developers to experiment with its features.","Google handsets can track motion in 3D and map their surroundings .

"Internet trolls who post one-off offensive messages may escape criminal charges, the country’s chief prosecutor announced yesterday. Keir Starmer said court action would be taken only where there was a ‘sustained campaign of  harassment’ or a direct threat, as he stressed the need to protect free speech. The Director of Public Prosecutions made his comments as he announced that a semi-professional footballer who posted a homophobic tweet about Olympic diver Tom Daley would not face criminal charges. Twitter target: The semi-professional footballer who posted a homophobic tweet about Olympic diver Tom Daley (pictured) will not face charges . He said the comments were not so ‘grossly offensive’ that they should lead to a prosecution. Daniel Thomas sent the message about Daley, 18, and diving partner Peter Waterfield, 31, after the pair missed out on a medal on July 30. Thomas, who plays for Welsh side Port Talbot Town, was arrested after the tweet spread around the internet. It falsely suggested that Daley and Waterfield were in a gay relationship and drew a link between homosexuality and HIV. Under the 2003 Communications Act, it is an offence to send messages online that are grossly offensive. The popularity of social networking sites has raised concerns that police will be swamped by similar cases. Last year officers dealt with 14,000 cases of abuse on Facebook alone.  Mr Starmer said new guidelines will be drawn up to deal with such abuse. He indicated that in future, Twitter trolls could face some other sanction short of criminal prosecution, which should be used only in extreme cases. This could include a police caution or a fixed penalty notice. Chief prosecutor: Keir Starmer said Twitter trolls could face an alternative sanction short of criminal prosecution . He also suggested a greater role for social networking sites in moderating comments and cracking down on users who post deeply offensive messages. He said: ‘Social media is a new and emerging phenomenon, raising difficult issues of principle, which have to be confronted not only by prosecutors but also by others including the police, the courts and service providers. ‘The fact that offensive remarks may not warrant a full criminal prosecution does not necessarily mean that no action should  be taken.’ Mr Starmer accepted Thomas’s tweet was ‘homophobic’ but said it had been a misguided attempt at humour. The message was also not intended to go beyond his Twitter followers, who were mainly friends and family. And he said the message was quickly taken down and the footballer had apologised. Prosecutors contacted the two divers and both said they did not want a prosecution. Mr Starmer said: ‘This was, in essence, a one-off offensive Twitter message, intended for family and friends, which made its way into the public domain. ‘It was not intended to reach  Mr Daley or Mr Waterfield, it was not part of a campaign, it was  not intended to incite others  and Mr Thomas removed it  reasonably swiftly and has expressed remorse. ‘Before reaching a final decision in this case, Mr Daley and Mr Waterfield were consulted by the CPS and both indicated that they did not think this case needed a prosecution.’ On the same day Thomas posted his message, Daley was also the subject of trolling by a 17-year-old boy who posted abusive and threatening messages on Twitter. Teenager Reece Messer, from Weymouth, Dorset, was arrested after he tweeted: ‘You let your dad down. I hope you know that.’ Daley’s father, Rob, died of a brain tumour last year. Daley, who went on to win bronze in the individual 10m diving competition, retweeted the message to his followers on the site with the comment: ‘After giving it my all . . . you get idiots sending me this.’ Messer also threatened to ‘drown’ the diver but apologised when his messages provoked a storm of outrage. He was later given a police caution for harassment. Chief Constable Andy Trotter, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the new guidance would help police to focus on the most serious online abuse.","Director of Public Prosecutions: Online trolls who post one-off offensive comments won't face charges .

"One of the only Thomson's gazelles in the UK has been hand-reared by zoo keepers after it was rejected by its mother. Lazarus - also known as Larry - was born at Bedfordshire’s Whipsnade Zoo and workers were forced to take him home with them for round-the-clock care. The Thomson's gazelle was born as part of an exciting breeding programme run by the Zoological Society of London, but was rejected by his mother not long after the birth. Despite initially looking as if she was properly caring for her firstborn fawn, it was soon clear that the newborn gazelle's mother was unable to produce any milk for her young. Zookeepers were forced to step in and provide around the clock feeding for the fawn. ‘Initially, he needed quite a lot of attention and feeding around the clock, so it was more practical just to take him home for the first few days,’ senior keeper Mark Holden said. Once he was feeding and taking his milk well, the decision was made to return young Larry to the zoo. Still a baby! Larry the Thomson gazelle at one-week old, where zookeepers were feeding him around the clock . Doing much better: Senior keeper Mark Holden is pictured here feeding the young gazelle . Zookeepers were quick to re-integrate him with his fellow Thomson's gazelles - especially considering he is only one of four Thomson's gazelles currently in the United Kingdom. ‘He’s a bit more of a handful now, which is good - because that’s what we want to see. It’s a good indication that he’s feeding well and obviously he’s becoming stronger,’ Mr Holden said. Despite being touch-and-go for a while, Larry pulled through and is now doing well.","ZSL acquired breeding group of Thomson's gazelles earlier this year .

"Jack Straw's son has caused a stir today after posting a photograph on Twitter celebrating an Easter tradition with Morris dancers with blacked-up faces. Will Straw, 32, who has been selected by Labour to fight one of the party's top target seats at next year's general election, uploaded the tweet after meeting The Britannia Coconutters. The 32-year-old, who is hoping to win back the Rossendale and Darwen constituency in East Lancashire, responded to the outcry - some have branded the tradition 'racist' - defending the historic performances and urging people to find out more via the group's website. He tweeted: 'Just checked . back on twitter & (sic) seen torrent of ignorant tweets on Britannia . Coconut dancers. Nothing racist about it', posting a link to the . dancer's website. Controversy: Will Straw, the son of former Home Secretary Jack Straw, sparked anger after posting a picture of himself with the Britannia Coconut Dancers, after watching their traditional Easter Saturday performances in the Pennine town of Bacup . Tradition: The 32-year-old, who was selected by the Labour party to run for one of their top target seats in East Lancashire at next year's general election, has been branded a 'racist' by people responding to his tweet (pictured). Others moved to defend the group, revealing its historic connections with the area . The Britannia Coconut Dancers take to the streets of the town of Bacup every Easter Saturday, performing their folk dances across the town . The group, who dress up in turbans and red and white skirts and clogs, congregate on Easter Saturday every year in the Penine town of Bacup. The tradition, which dates back to the turn of the century, sees the dancers perform through the streets, from one edge of the town to the other over a 12-hour period. The group's website reveals: 'The dances they perform are actually folk dances and the custom of blackened faces may reflect a pagan or medieval background which was done to disguise the dancers from being recognised by evil spirits afterwards, it may also reflect mining connections.' But being pictured with the group has landed Mr Straw in hot water today, after the Twitter community reacted with shock at his being photographed with the dancers. The message posted alongside the picture, reads: 'Good to talk to Neville Earnshaw of world famous Britannia Coconutters in the New Inn. Great Bacup tradition.' The tweet has provoked dozens of responses, with some labeling the tradition 'racist'. @VoluntaryAnarch wrote: 'Jack Straw's son @wdjstraw parachuted into Rossendale, praises a racist custom as a ""great tradition"" to ingratiate himself with the locals.' @PndsC added: '@wdjstraw Are you f****** serious? Jesus christ, why did you think this was a good idea?' @STYLISA tweeted: '@wdjstraw You do realise that this picture is pretty offensive don't you?' And @TonyM70 said: '@WikiGuido @wdjstraw A tradition? Like lynching used to be? Doesn't make it right.' Will Straw (left) is hoping to follow in the footsteps of his father Jack Straw (right) and win back the key seat in next year's general election . Meanwhile others moved to show their support for the Morris dancers, recognising the tradition. @yorkierosie urged people to 'do some research before taking to stirring', offering a link to the Britannia Coconut Dancers website. Mr Straw told MailOnline the tradition must be treasured and preserved. He said: 'As many small towns throughout Britain struggle to maintain their identity against a tide of high street chains, betting shops and fast food outlets, Bacup’s annual dance  provides a window into a previous era and a clear sense of local tradition. 'Whatever the origins, we should all hope it will continue for many centuries to come.' Mr Straw's target seat was held by Labour before the 2010 general election when the Tories' Jake Berry won it with a majority of 4,493. The son of the former Home Secretary, an ex-Fulbright scholar and Oxford graduate, beat five other local candidates to win the post. As a 17-year-old Straw junior was caught trying to sell cannabis to undercover reporters, while his father was in the Cabinet. He was forced to write to Mr Blair apologising for 'letting down and embarrassing the Labour Party'. Mr Straw is the first in a long line of 'red princes and princesses' whose parents are MPs, to win selection for the 2015 election. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair's son Euan is said to be targetting the ultra-safe seat of Bootle, Merseyside ahead of the election campaign. The Labour Party declined to comment. The Britannia Coconut Dancers, known as the 'Nutters', are part of the history of the small Penine town of Bacup. Every Easter Saturday the troupe of men - dressed in red and white kilts and clogs, with their faces blackened - take to the streets of the town to dance their way from one side to the other. They perform folk dances, which are said to have originated with Moorish pirates. The custom of blackened faces, reflects, according to their website, a 'pagan or medieval background' to 'disguise the dancers from being recognised by evil spirits'. The tradition is said to originate from Moorish pirates who first settled in Cornwall and moved north as the mines opened in Lancashire . It is also thought to link to the town's mining heritage. Moorish pirates who settled in Cornwall and found themselves employed in the mines are said to have brought the dances to British shores. As mines and quaries opened in Lancashire in the 18th and 19th Centuries, a number of Cornish men travelled north. With them they brought the dances and the traditions now upheld by the Nutters. The dances spread throughout the Rossendale area, and at the turn of the century four dance troupes existed. It is from the Tunstead Mill Troupe that the Britannia group descended. The dances are accompanied by the English concertina, and for Easter Saturday the group are joined by a silver band. The music, like the dance steps, has been handed down from generation to generation. The 'Nutters' have performed across the world, including taking to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall for the English Folk Dance and Song Society.","Will Straw tweeted a picture with members of the Britannia Coconutters .

"As a married marketing executive and mother to a teenage son, Isabel Young could never have imagined the career path she would eventually follow. But finding herself single and lonely at the age of 55, she decided she wanted to do something completely different - and signed up to become a sex line worker. Isabel (not her real name), from Leeds, now logs on with a sex line company for a couple of hours an evening and takes calls from men looking for, as she puts it, 'relief'. She told the MailOnline: 'I get a real cross-section of callers of men of all ages looking for a good time. But the majority are just lonely and want someone to talk to. 'The older men tend to stay on the phone longer for general conversation and some smutty talk while the younger men call for relief.' Secret role: Isabel, not her real name, loves the fact nobody knows about her evening work for a sex line . Isabel said nobody knows her secret profession and her friends and family would be shocked if they knew how she's spending her evenings. The single mother-of-one said she would consider giving up the job if she met a new man who didn't approve, but for now she is relishing her new role. She said: 'I'm doing it for myself. I live alone and, like some of the men that call me, I'm lonely and want someone to talk to. 'It's escapism for me and I've found it very liberating and empowering.' Isabel had been working as a highly paid executive in the field of marketing but gave up her role at the insistence of her husband who wanted her to have more time for the family. However, he then left her for a younger woman. Isabel said it took her a long time to get back on her feet and working for the sex line has been one way of re-building her confidence and 'getting her own back on men.' She said: 'I like the fact they don't know who I am and I can take on whatever character they want me to.' She admitted after being married for years, she had led a 'sheltered life' but working for the sex line has 'opened her eyes.' 'Initially I was shocked by the language and sexual terms people use but it's opened my eyes and I take it all in my stride now,' she confessed. However, she added it still never 'ceases to amaze' her what some people request when they ring. Strange fetishes: Isabel said the requests she gets from callers never ceases to amaze her . She said: 'There is no script, I follow the lead of the people who call and what they want - which are sometimes things I could never have imagined. Smoking is one fetish that surprises me as some want me to pretend I'm blowing smoke in their faces. 'Others like financial things such as pretending I'm stealing money from their accounts. Domination is always a popular theme.' Isabel spoke to the MailOnline on the condition of anonymity to celebrate the DVD release of 'For A Good Time Call', a film about two young women who start up a sex line business from their New York apartment to earn some extra cash. Making money was also another of Isabel's incentives - although she admits the job isn't going to make her a millionaire. 'I do it part-time in the evenings for a couple of hours so I usually make £100 a week. I see it as a good opportunity for some extra money,' she said. Isabel said she always feels completely safe as the callers have no idea who she is and there are strict guidelines on what she is allowed to talk about. Giving any personal information on herself is forbidden while if a caller suggests anything illegal, such as involving animals or children, she immediately hangs up. Isabel said while the job is out of her comfort zone and something she'd never imagined she would ever do, she's currently enjoying every minute. 'I like the fact I can live this fantasy life and nobody knows about it,' she said. For a Good Time, Call is out on Blu-ray and DVD from 25th February .","Isabel Young (not her real name) took the job for a sex line because she was single, lonely and wanted some extra cash .

"'If your man is not asking you for sex anymore, it means he's seeking it elsewhere. He's not going to accept being in a marriage without sex,' says ex-prostitute Rebecca Dakin, 37. 'I'm sure there are women who know that their man has been cheating but are happy because they don't want to have sex with him anymore. 'They are probably relieved that he's not hassling them and just decide to turn a blind eye. Everyone always hates the escorts but you have to remember there are women are probably quite thankful that they're around.' Rebecca Dakin, 37, spent nine years working as an escort after dropping out of university and finding only low-paid jobs. Her first session with a client earned her £1,400. Now she works as a dating coach and sexpert . Valentine's Day evokes mixed emotions for Rebecca, reminding her of the nine years she worked as an escort and of the men who will cheat on their wives this February 14, many of them with paid companions. These days, Rebecca works as an author, dating coach and infidelity expert - something she feels she has a unique perspective on. She says it is her duty to educate both men and women about the reasons married men seek out the company of escorts. Valentine's Day was Rebecca's busiest time, she says - though on one such rendezvous she was shocked when her client called reception for champagne and a change of sheets as his wife was arriving in half an hour . 'About 60 per cent of the men I saw while I was escorting were married or had girlfriends,' says Rebecca. 'Men cheat for different reasons. Some may be genuinely lacking intimacy at home but others just get off . on the danger element of wondering whether they'll get caught.' Valentine's Day can be a busy time for escorts. On one occasion, Rebecca spent the . afternoon in a Newcastle hotel with a client. When they had finished . having sex, he called down to reception asking for champagne and a . change of sheets as his wife was arriving half an hour later for a . romantic Valentine's evening with her husband. Rebecca says she doesn't know why prostitutes always get the blame. 'It's the responsibility of the person in the relationship to be faithful,' she says . 'I was so angry,' says Rebecca. 'I think clients sometimes forgot that my loyalties lie with women. 'I don't know why we always get the blame in these situations – it's the responsibility of the person in the relationship to be faithful. 'Even if the hottest woman in the world comes on to your boyfriend, he should be strong enough to withstand it and, if he's not, she's done you a favour.' Rebecca remembers another occasion on which she spent the night in London with a married client who had told his wife he was watching a football match in Manchester. 'In the morning he was he in bed reading the paper, catching up on the football results and memorising who had scored goals and what had happened during the match. Later that day, his wife called and I heard him telling her about the match – even what the weather had been like.' Despite such experiences, Rebecca enjoyed her work from the moment she began escorting aged 25. After failing at college, struggling through a string of dead end jobs, and without any capital or training behind her, Rebecca decided that this was her only chance of making good money. The daughter of a navy navigator and a . school teacher, Rebecca had an auspicious start in life, attending a . convent school in Derbyshire and embarking on a fashion degree. However, after dropping out of . university without finishing her course, Rebecca found herself in a . cycle of boring, low paid jobs. By this time, she had already worked as a . glamour model and a dancer so, for her, becoming an escort was the next . step. Since she was living at home at the time, Rebecca was honest with her parents about what she was planning to do. 'My parents had despaired of me,' she says. 'I'd always been a rebellious child and . at this point they just didn't know what to do with me. It would have . been different if I was 18, but because I was 25 I think they realised I . was an adult and they just wanted to let me make my own mistakes. 'It was not the job my mum would have chosen for me but once she saw I was going to really nice restaurants and hotels and meeting people like bankers and solicitors, I think she became marginally more comfortable with it.' Rebecca's mum dropped her at the bus . stop the day she went to see her first client, an accountant in . Liverpool. While she barely had the money for a bus fare on the way to . her date, on the way back Rebecca was £1,400 richer. 'I . remember getting the train back and just counting all these notes,' she . says. 'After working for as little as £100 a week in my previous job as . a travel agent, I couldn't believe I'd just made so much money.' Rebecca didn't look back and within three months of setting up her own business, she had a mortgage and was buying her own flat. 'The . guy in the bank gave me a mortgage straight away when he heard I was an . escort,' she says. 'He told me they never had any problem with girls in . my profession.' Because she chose always to work for . herself rather than for an agency, Rebecca would spend the days looking . for new clients, doing admin and organising her own advertising. 'I'd always been a rebellious child and at this point my parents didn't know what to do with me' As . she was highly selective about who she would see, Rebecca never spent . time with more than 4 men a week and sometimes went for a month without a . booking if she didn't feel comfortable about any of the potential . clients who would get in touch. When she did work, the rewards were . great. Specialising in overnight stays, Rebecca frequently found herself . whisked abroad, spending time with men in Hong Kong, Dubai, Italy, . Paris and Switzerland. She saw some clients regularly and developed . close relationships with them. 'My favourite was a guy in his 70s,' she says. 'He . was married but his wife didn't want to sleep in the same bed as him . anymore because he snored! He owned a factory and was loaded - he would . spend thousands of pounds on jewellery and clothes for me. I liked him . because he was a lovely guy though, very respectful with a dry sense of . humour. We didn't even really have sex - it was more about the . companionship.' 'Cheating is not black and white. There are some circumstances where people don't have any other options' Although the money was good and Rebecca admits to getting a buzz from dressing up and walking into swanky hotels to meet her clients, eventually she decided enough was enough. 'I want to have kids and settle down and I didn't want to be working as an escort while I did that,' she says. 'I wanted to prove to myself that I could do something else and was capable of earning money in another way.' Rebecca says that men cheat for myriad reasons. 'Some guys are just cheats,' she says. 'Some are not confident about communicating with their other half. They think that if they tell her they want more sex, she'll be upset. 'Some don't want to leave, as they love their wife, but they need more intimacy. By seeing an escort, they're just trying to find a way to stay with the woman they love.' Although Rebecca does not condone cheating, in some instances she thinks it can be justified. 'I want to challenge women's point of view. I want women to read the stories in my book and think - I quite like this guy and understand where he's coming from.' One man who has anonymously contributed to Rebecca's book is living with a wife who suffers from severe manic depression. He doesn't want to leave because he would have to take the children and his wife would be broken-hearted, but he still craves intimacy with a woman and has therefore decided to pay escorts for sex and companionship. 'You can't help but feel for him,' Rebecca says. 'Cheating is not black and white. There are some circumstances where people don't have any other options. My book will be really valuable insight into how men are thinking.' It has now been three years since Rebecca worked as an escort and, although she sometimes misses the quick cash, her life has moved on. At the same time as writing her book on infidelity, she is putting together a book of sex tips, working as a media ‘sexpert' and running a dating coach service, charging men for Skype sessions in which she guides them through the minefields of flirting, dating and relationships using her training as an NLP Master Practitioner. 'Some women have a problem with me giving this advice because of the job I used to do but I've dated around 900 men and my knowledge comes from experience,' says Rebecca. 'I know what I'm doing is of value – I just want to help people stay in relationships.' There are 2 free chapters of Rebecca's first book, The Girlfriend Experience, and samples of her forthcoming book, Why Husbands Stray, on her website www.rebeccadakin.com. Rebecca is available as a dating coach and media sexpert.","Rebecca Dakin, 37, from Derbyshire, worked as an escort for nine years .

"The European Parliament has upheld a £2,400 fine against UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage. The MEP was docked the money in 2010 for tearing into Herman Van Rompuy, who had just been appointed EU president. Addressing the former Belgian premier in parliament, Mr Farage said he had ‘the charisma of a damp rag’ and the ‘appearance of a low-grade bank clerk’. Scroll down for video . Fined: Nigel Farage was forced to give up $4,000- the equivalent of 10-days pay- for insulting an EU politician during a floor speech . As Mr Van Rompuy listened, Mr Farage added that the Belgian came from 'pretty much a non-country.' Jerzy Buzek, the then parliamentary . chief, ordered Mr Farage to apologise. He refused and the authorities . cut €3,000 from his pay. He appealed to the European Court of . Justice but it ruled that he filed his appeal too late and would also . have to pay parliament's legal expenses. Mr Farage was unrepentant last night, . saying: ‘They have made themselves a laughing stock over this. It is a . simple question of free speech.’ Although MEPs have protection from . prosecution when discussing political issues or constituency matters . this legal privilege does not extend to personal comments. The penalty comes two years after the wrongdoing, when Mr Farage gave a theatrical speech in the . European parliament in February 2010. The sparring: The insult took place during a session of the European Parliament when Mr Farage (left) questioned Mr von Rompuy's (right) appointment . He went from discussing the . appointment of Mr Van Rompuy and dissecting his qualifications starting . with his credentials and critiquing his appearance. ‘I'm sorry but... and I don't want to . be rude, but you know really, you have the charisma of a damp rag and . the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk,’ he said. ‘I sense though that you're competent . and capable and dangerous, and I have no doubt that it’s your intention . to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and the European nation . state.

'I defend absolutely Mr Farage's right . to disagree about the policy or institutions of the Union, but not to . personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country . from which they may come,' he said in a statement at the time. 'I am disappointed by Mr Farage's . behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his . own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European . Parliament. ‘I invited him to apologise, but he . declined to do so.

"She, her boyfriend and several members of his entourage were involved in a massive bar brawl just hours before. But Chris Brown's girlfriend Karrueche Tran didn't appear to have a care in the world as she left her hotel with the singer's camp this afternoon. In fact the 24-year-old model was laughing and smiling as she hotfooted it to an awaiting car with a handful of Brown's assistants. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Like nothing had even happened: Chris Brown's girlfriend Karrueche Tran didn't appear to have a care in the world as she left her hotel with the singer's camp this afternoon . However, others in the group didn't appear to be sharing Tran's upbeat attitude, with two friends hardly unable to raise a smile. Tran, who was present when the brawl went down in Manhattan club WIP last night, was casual in a pair of light grey leggings and a white printed T-shirt. She toted a leopard print handbag and a pair of bright pink Nike Air Jordans on her feet. Meanwhile Chris is currently dealing with aftermath of the brawl he was involved in with fellow entertainer Drake last night. Not happy: However, others in the group didn't . appear to be sharing Tran's upbeat attitude, with two friends hardly . unable to raise a smile . Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos happened to be in the Big Apple at the time of the incident and today is speaking with detectives from the New York Police Department, according to Radaronline. Chris had called his lawyer immediately after the attack. 'Contrary to reports Chris didn't flee from the scene, it was a very fluid situation and Chris just wanted to make sure that his girlfriend, Karreuche Tran, was safe,' a source told the website. 'Luckily for Chris, his attorney happened to already be in New York City and he has been talking with detectives from the NYPD and with management at the nightclub. Home time: Later in the afternoon Karreueche kept her head down as she arrived back at the SoHo hotel . Best of enemies: Drake, left, and Chris, right, seen partying on opposite sides of club WiP before the night ended in bottle throwing with Chris sustaining a cut to the chin . The aftermath: Broken glass can be seen strewn across the bar following the Chris and Drake fight . 'Chris, Karreuche and other members of his entourage will fully cooperate with law enforcement.' Meanwhile . Chris's publicist has released a statement, stating that Chris, . Karreuche and his entourage were the 'victims' of the attack.

Chris and his party are cooperating with NY . authorities who are pursuing this incident further.' Clash: Chris posted a picture of his cut chin to his ten million followers after an alleged brawl with rapper Drake . The nightclub brawl took place in the early hours of this morning. Following the incident Brown posted a picture of a nasty gash on his chin - which he apparently sustained from the fallout with Drake and his entourage. Brown . allegedly flew into a rage after Drake taunted him by returning a . bottle of champagne he'd sent over as 'peace offering' with a note . reading:  'I'm f****** the love of your life, deal with it'. Drakes crude response was clearly a reference to Brown's ex-girlfriend Rihanna. According to website Global Grind Chris reportedly flew into a rage and confronted Drake. Drake allegedly threw a punch but before the singer could retaliate, another man hit Brown in the face with a bottle. A source told the New York Post: 'They were on opposite sides of the room, Drake went over to the middle of the club to talk to someone, then words were exchanged with Chris and his entourage. The source said someone from Drake's entourage, possibly the singer himself, threw a bottle. 'Once the bottle was thrown, all hell broke loose and there were more bottles thrown.' TMZ is also reporting that the fight kicked off after Drake stuck his middle finger up to one of Brown's bodyguards. He also shouted 'I'm about to go whoop that a**!' What then began was hand gestures flying back and forth between the parties. Close: Rihanna and Drake get very close in their video Take Care . After feeling 'disrespected', the . rapper reportedly recruited his friends Meek Mill, Juelz Santana, and Trav B for . backup, and proceeded to yell at Brown from across the club shouting: . 'You be on that ho s*** on Twitter n***a,' referencing to their famous . Twitter war of words. This then prompted Chris entourage to get angry and the brawl promptly erupting. The fight allegedly kicked off as the last song was playing, just before 4 a.m. Police were . already at the scene because it was closing time and that they 'were on . it in seconds and began getting everyone out of the club.' Pictures of the aftermath show the club floor strewn with broken glass. Brown was pulled out of the situation by his own security and helped out of the club while Drake was pulled to the back of the club, the source said. '[Drake] was one of the last out of W.I.P.'

"Can you tell what someone's like in bed simply by looking at their face? Talk is cheap. If you really want to know what someone's like, look at their face. Well, that's what Siang Mien devotees claim. The Chinese have been practising the art of face reading for more than 3000 years and say our features speak a secret language, telling all about our character and hidden desires. Tracey says by using Chinese face reading we can tell a lot about our partner's sexual preferences . Don't scoff just yet - there's a certain logic to the craft. We know for a fact no-one has an identical face, not even identical twins. That's because no-one has identical personalities. The human face is capable of making 7000 distinct expressions - we might only use a mere few hundred of these in everyday life, but the expressions we use the most leave a mark on our faces. By the time we hit 40, you can certainly determine whether we've spent most of our lives smiling or frowning! Face reading is fascinating stuff and devotees claim it provides loads of clues to character (though admittedly some of it varied and contradictory!). Here's a round up of the supposed giveaway sexual signs. If you come out of it in a flattering way, it has to be true. If not…well, saying 'Your eyebrows tell me you're addicted to sex' is one hell of a good opener at a dinner party. EYEBROWS . Small and sparse: Zero interest in sex, major interest in zen. Think spiritual rather than sensual.Thick and bushy: Sexually excessive. Feed with a steady diet of new erotic experiences or they're likely to grab snacks-on-the-side. Small and sparse eyebrows suggests you are more spiritual than sensual . EYES . Very pale eyes: Looking for new peaks and a quick fix. Easily sexually satisfied (good news if you just want sex), they attach little importance to it or love (not so good if you want a relationship). A tendency to change partners faster than outfits. Dark eyes: Passionate and into marathon deep and meaningfuls, they're hard to get to know initially, but you won't regret the effort. Dynamite in bed. Keep them there with lots of intense, varied sex. NOSE . Snub nose Dreamy and into romantic sex and traditional positions – which could translate to drippy for some. Not interested in erotic adventures. Bumpy nose Not a good match for the snub nosed, bumpy nosed people are the complete opposite. Not only do they love sex, they like loads of it – the kinkier the better! Tracey says her fine lines around her nose suggest that she rarely thinks about anything other than sex . LINES . Small thin lines under the lower eyelids It's not something you usually look for...until now. This is the mark of someone with an enormous sexual appetite, who's constantly ready for sex. Nothing is forbidden and everything goes. Fine lines below the base of the nose I shamefully own up to having these but insist it's from smoking in the past. This is apparently a sure-fire sign of someone who rarely thinks about anything else but sex (well, it is my job!) Blessed/cursed with the highest libido of all, they need to be loved in every way possible and are extremely hard to satisfy. (Not true. Honest!) LIPS AND MOUTH . Large mouth When comes to mouths, the bigger the better seems to apply. Large mouthed lovers are unselfish and take time to pleasure. Men with large mouths are regarded as unbeatably potent lovers. If you've got a full bottom lip, score extra points – you're a sensual adventurer - minus points for also being shamelessly unfaithful. People with wide mouths are ambitious creatures who want to be (and are) boss of the bedroom. Small mouth True, they're imaginative and inventive, but that's where the compliments end. They're also quick to orgasm, wary of new people, loyal only to a few and not very affectionate!

"A Danish woman has become the latest Westerner to travel to the besieged Syrian city of Kobane and join Kurdish forces bravely battling Islamic State militants. Joanna Palani, a 20-year-old of Kurdish descent, is understood to have written a message on her Facebook page describing a minor foot injury she picked up during a 'hard' attack on the jihadis. Minutes earlier she had updated the page with a photograph of herself calmly smiling while wearing military fatigues, a bullet proof vest and carrying a large assault rifle - threatening ISIS militants with the words: 'See you on the front line tomorrow'. Ms Palani has become the latest Westerner to join the fight against ISIS in Kobane, where Syrian Kurds assisted by Iraqi Peshmerga troops and US and Arab coalition warplanes have managed to force hundreds of militants out of the centre of the city.

Brave: Joanna Palani, a 20-year-old of Kurdish descent, uploaded this picture to her Facebook page showing her calmly smiling while wearing military fatigues, a bullet proof vest and carrying a large assault rifle . Ms Palani (left) - who has lived in Denmark since she was three-years-old - has joined the Kurdish YPJ regiment - the all-female sister force of the better known YPG (a member of which is pictured with her, right) Ms Palani is the latest Westerner to join the fight against ISIS in Kobane (pictured), where Syrian Kurds assisted by Iraqi Peshmerga troops and US warplanes have forced hundreds of militants out the city centre . Details of Ms Palani's journey to fight ISIS in Syria were reported by the Danish newspaper BT. Less than a month ago she had made a gave an interview to Politiken saying that she was dropping out mid-way through her college course and intended to join the fight against ISIS in Kobane. It is likely Ms Palani, who has lived in Denmark since she was three-years-old, has joined the Kurdish YPJ regiment - the all-female force of the better known YPG (People's Protection Unit). Both groups are affiliated with the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party), which has been designated a terror group by NATO, but Ms Palani makes it clear that she does not agree with this assessment. 'The Kurds are fighting for democracy and Western values,' she was quoted as saying. 'If I get captured or killed, I will be proud of why I was killed. If I was afraid of the consequences of going down there, I would not consider it,' she reportedly added. Reinforcements: Earlier this a photograph emerged on social media showing a group of men understood to have travelled to the city from Britain, the United States and Germany . Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, posted images of their riders posing in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane. They are there fighting ISIS terrorists . In her earlier interview with Politiken before she left for Syria, Ms Palani said she would do exactly the same thing had Denmark come under attack by Islamic extremists. 'I love Denmark. I grew up here and I love the freedom of our society. If Denmark should ever be attacked, I'm going to go in the front row with a Danish flag around my shoulders,' she was quoted as saying. 'But I've Kurdish family, and right now it is the Kurds who are attacked by brainwashed Islamists,' she added. 'she told  in October.

The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobane to join the fight against ISIS. This morning Kurdish fighters captured six buildings from ISIS near Kobane and seized a large haul of their weapons and ammunition, a group monitoring the war said. The terror group has been desperately trying to capture the town for more than two months in an assault that has driven tens of thousands of Kurdish civilians over the border into Turkey. A YPG fighter is seen firing at Islamic State terrorists from behind sandbags in the city of Kobane . An Iraqi Peshmerga fighter picks up a mortar shell in Kobane. The Iraqi Kurds travelled to Kobane to help their Syrian kin force the Islamic State out of the besieged Syrian city . The six buildings seized by Kurdish fighters this morning were in a strategic location in the town's north, close to Security Square where the main municipal offices are based, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. His group that tracks the three-year-old conflict in Syria using sources on the ground. The Kurds also took a large quantity of rocket-propelled grenade launchers, guns and machine gun ammunition. The clashes killed around 13 Islamic State militants, including two senior fighters who had been helping to lead the militant group's assault on the town, he said. Kurdish forces appear to have made other gains in recent days of fighting. Last week they blocked a road Islamic State was using to resupply its forces, the first major gain against the jihadists after weeks of violence. 'During the last few days we have made big progress in the east and southeast,' said Idris Nassan, an official in Kobane. But Islamic State still appeared to be holding a significant grip on the town. Abdulrahman estimated it controlled more than 50 percent of the city.","Joanna Palani, 20, is believed to have travelled to Syria from Denmark .

"It's been a subject of debate for decades, but it seems diet really does have an impact on a person's complexion. A landmark overview of research carried out over the past 50 years has found that eating foods with a high glycaemic index (GI) and drinking milk not only aggravated acne but in some cases triggered it, too. Millions of teenagers - and increasingly adults - are affected by the often painful skin condition which causes the skin to develop unsightly spots on the face, neck, chest and back. Could cutting out milk be the cure for the millions suffering with acne? Acne is caused by a combination of the skin producing too much sebum and a build-up of dead skin cells which clogs the pores and leads to a localised infection or spot. It is thought that excess sebum production is caused by hormonal fluctuations, which explains why around 80 per cent of teenagers experience bouts of acne throughout adolescence. While there is no danger from the spots themselves, severe acne can scar as well as lead to anxiety, low self-esteem and depression. Red faced: Even stars like Cameron Diaz are not immune to breakouts . Since the late 19th century, research has linked diet to acne, with chocolate, sugar and fat singled out as the main culprits. But studies carried out from the 1960s onwards have disassociated diet from the development of the condition. Dr Jennifer Burris from the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, New York University, said: 'This change (in attitude) occurred largely because of the  two important studies that are repeatedly cited in the literature and popular culture as evidence to refute the association between diet and acne. 'More recently, dermatologists and . registered dieticians have revisited the diet-acne relationship and . become increasingly interested in the role of medical nutritional . therapy in acne treatment.' Eating high GI foods - foods that are absorbed into the bloodstream quickly -  is thought to have a direct effect on the severity of acne because of the hormonal fluctuations that are triggered. Only carbohydrates have a GI rating. Because low GI foods take longer for the body to break down they help you feel fuller for longer too. High GI foods include sugary fizzy drinks, cakes, pastries, chocolate, white bread and potatoes. Low GI foods include fruit and vegetables, wholegrain options such as brown pasta, basmati rice, cous cous and pulses. Not overcooking your pasta and vegetables helps lower the GI. High GI foods cause a spike in hormone levels including insulin which is thought to instigate sebum production. An 2007 Australian study showed that . young males who were put on a strict low GI diet noticed a significant . improvement in the severity of their acne. Milk is thought to affect acne because of the hormones it contains. A 2007 study carried out by Harvard . School of Public Health found that there was a clear link between those who drank milk regularly and suffered with acne. Interestingly, those who drank skimmed milk suffered with the worst breakouts, with a 44 per cent  increase in the likelihood of developing blemishes. It is thought that processing the milk increases the levels of hormones in the drink. The authors of the latest overview - published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics - say that . dermatologists and dieticians should work together to design and conduct . quality research to help the millions of acne sufferers. 'This research is necessary to fully understand the underlying . mechanisms linking diet and acne,' added Dr . Burris. 'The medical community should not dismiss the possibility of . diet therapy as an adjunct treatment for acne. At this time, the best . approach is to address each acne patient individually, carefully . considering the possibility of dietary counselling.'","Review of 50 years of clinical studies indicates there IS a link between diet and acne after all .
High GI diets are one culprit, as they cause peaks in blood sugar and hormonal fluctuations .
Skimmed milk in particular may also trigger outbreaks due to hormones used in processing it, say experts ."
"When Candida L. Gutierrez's identity was stolen, the thief didn't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts. She assumed Gutierrez's persona completely, using it to get a job, a driver's license, a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children. All the while, the crook claimed the real Gutierrez was the one who had stolen her identity. The women's kafkaesque nightmare puts a face on 'total identity theft,' a brazen form of the crime in which con artists go far beyond financial fraud to assume many other aspects of another person's life. The scheme has been linked to illegal immigrants who use stolen Social Security numbers to get paid at their jobs, and authorities fear the problem could soon grow to ensnare more unsuspecting Americans. Defrauded: Houston school teacher Candida Gutierrez, pictured had her identity stolen several years ago and has been battling with the government since . Gutierrez learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago. Now she trudges to the Social Security Administration with her birth certificate, driver's license, passport  to prove her identity . 'When she claimed my identity and I claimed it back, she was informed that I was claiming it too,' said Gutierrez, a 31-year-old Houston elementary school teacher. 'She knew I was aware and that I was trying to fight, and yet she would keep fighting. It is not like she realized and she stopped. No, she kept going, and she kept going harder.' A 32-year-old illegal immigrant named Benita Cardona-Gonzalez is accused of using Gutierrez's identity during a 10-year period when she worked at a Topeka company that packages refrigerated foods. For years, large numbers of illegal immigrants have filled out payroll forms using their real names but stolen Social Security numbers. However, as electronic employment verification systems such as E-Verify become more common, the use of fake numbers is increasingly difficult. Now prosecutors worry that more people will try to fool the systems by assuming full identities rather than stealing the numbers alone. For victims, total identity theft can also have serious health consequences if electronic medical records linked to Social Security numbers get mixed up, putting at risk the accuracy of important patient information such as blood types or life-threatening allergies. Federal Trade Commission statistics show that Americans reported more than 279,000 instances of identity theft in 2011, up from 251,100 a year earlier. While it is unclear how many of those cases involve total identity theft, one possible indicator is the number of identity theft complaints that involve more than one type of identity theft - 13 percent last year, compared with 12 percent a year earlier. When Gutierrez's identity was stolen, the thief didn't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts. She assumed her persona completely, using it to get a job, a license, a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children . Nationwide, employment-related fraud accounted for 8 percent of identity theft complaints last year. But in states with large immigrant populations, employment-related identity fraud was much higher: 25 percent in Arizona, 15 percent in Texas, 16 percent in New Mexico, 12 percent in California. Prosecutors say that the longer a person uses someone else's identity, the more confident the thief becomes using that identity for purposes other than just working. 'It is such a horrible nightmare. You get really angry, and then you start realizing anger is not going to help. But when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life, it is really such a big inconvenience.' Once they have become established in a community, identity thieves don't want to live in the shadows and they seek a normal life like everybody else. That's when they take the next step and get a driver's license, a home loan and health insurance. 'And so that is a natural progression, and that is what we are seeing,' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Anderson, who is prosecuting the case against Gutierrez's alleged impostor. Gutierrez first learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago. Now each year she trudges to the Social Security Administration with her birth certificate, driver's license, passport and even school yearbooks to prove her identity and clear her employment record. She spends hours on the phone with creditors and credit bureaus, fills out affidavits and has yet to clean up her credit history. Her tax records are a mess. She even once phoned the impostor's Kansas employer in a futile effort to find some relief. Both women claimed they were identity theft victims and sought to get new Social Security numbers. The Social Security Administration turned down the request from Gutierrez, instead issuing a new number to the woman impersonating her. Federal Trade Commission statistics show that Americans reported more than 279,000 instances of identity theft in 2011, up from 251,100 a year earlier . And in another ironic twist, Gutierrez was forced to file her federal income tax forms using a special identification number usually reserved for illegal immigrants. 'It is such a horrible nightmare,' Gutierrez said. 'You get really angry, and then you start realizing anger is not going to help. ... But when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life, it is really such a super big inconvenience. You have to find the time for someone who is abusing you.' When Gutierrez recently got married, her husband began researching identity theft on the Internet and stumbled across identity theft cases filed against other illegal immigrants working at Reser's Fine Foods, the same manufacturer where Cardona-Gonzalez worked. He contacted federal authorities in Kansas and asked them to investigate the employee working there who had stolen his wife's identity. The alleged impostor was arrested in August, and her fingerprints confirmed that immigration agents had encountered Cardona-Gonzalez in 1996 in Harlingen, Texas, and sent her back to Mexico. Cardona-Gonzalez did not respond to a letter sent to her at the Butler County jail, where she is awaiting trial on charges of aggravated identity theft, misuse of a Social Security number and production of a false document. Her attorney, Matthew Works, did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. Court filings indicate the two sides are negotiating a plea agreement. Citing privacy issues, the Social Security Administration declined to discuss the Gutierrez case. Reser's Fine Foods did not return a message left at its Topeka plant. Anderson expects more cases of total identity theft 'because we all know what is going on out there - which is thousands and thousands of people who are working illegally in the United States under false identities, mostly of U.S. citizens, and very little is being done about it. But we are doing something about it, one case at a time.'","Identity theft up from 251,100 reported cases in 2010 to 279,000 instances last year .

"Support: David Cameron signalled his backing for GM food after previously being sceptical about its use . David Cameron has given the clearest signal yet that the government wants to see controversial genetically-modified crops grown across the country. The Prime Minister told a conference of entrepreneurs that Britain needs to take a ‘really good look again’ at its policy on GM food if it is to prove it is a ‘pro-science’ country. The intervention from Mr Cameron that he wants to see a GM free-for-all across the UK will alarm those who deride genetic modification as ‘Frankenscience’. It emerged earlier this week that ministers are to push the European Union to relax restrictions on the cultivation of GM crops for human consumption. But it is the first time that the Prime Minister has spoken up in favour of the idea. In opposition he was seen as being sceptical of GM crops. Advocates argue that GM techniques increase crop yields, avoid the need for pesticides, and could be essential in assuring Britain's future food security. However, any relaxation of current restrictions will be in the teeth of much opposition. A survey by YouGov out today found only 21 per cent of the population supported the technology, while 35 per cent opposed it. Mr Cameron made the comments as he addressed an audience of scientists and business leaders in London at an innovation summit linked to the UK's leadership of the G8 group of the world's richest nations. He said: ‘We need to make sure we are a very pro-science country. I think there are one or two subjects there we need to take on. I think it's time we had a really good look again at GM food and all of that. ‘I think we need to be open to be open to arguments from science.’ The government is reported to be ready to call for EU restrictions on cultivation of the crops for human consumption to be relaxed. The coalition has allowed small-scale cultivation trials for GM food but widespread use is effectively banned. Some GM products are contained in imported foods, but most supermarkets have banned the ingredients from their own-brand products because of public unease about the material. The Prime Minister was addressing an audience of scientists and business leaders in London at an innovation summit linked to the UK's leadership of the G8 group of the world's richest nations . Genetically improved? Minsters believe GM crops could 'make agriculture more efficient' and help eradicate diseases such as dieback in the UK . Earlier this week, science minister David Willetts supported calls for controls on GM crops to be weakened to make it easier for Britain’s farmers to grow them. 'We believe that GM crops can help make agriculture more efficient and also just as importantly more sustainable, by, for example, reducing the use of pesticides and the use of fossil fuels,' he said. A European Commission analysis of 130 research projects carried out by 500 groups over 25 years concluded in 2010 that there is 'no scientific evidence associating genetically-modified organisms with higher risks for the environment or food and feed safety than conventional plants or organisms'. But opponents of GM crops argue that it is far too early to conclude that the technique is safe – including many farmers, with a quarter of those surveyed saying they would not cultivate them under any circumstances. They are concerned that GM crops could foster stronger pests, diseases and weeds that evolve to adapt to engineered plants. Trials: Attempts to grow genetically-modified crops have frequently been disrupted by protesters . Mr Cameron also used the innovation event to launch a prize fund, with £1million of taxpayers' money, to encourage revolutionary new ideas aimed at solving the world's biggest problem. He said the modern version of the 1714 Longitude Prize would be a ‘Britain's Got Talent’ for innovators. ‘There are so many problems in our world that need that amazing solution, whether it is a cure for dementia, solving the problem of diabetes, having a flight from Britain to New York that's carbon free,’ he said. ‘Let's challenge the public and challenge the scientists for which is the great problem we want to crack. ‘I'm thinking of something - Britain's Got Talent, you know, you switch on the TV and you watch the dog jumping over the pole, or whatever it is. Let's actually get the nation engaged on what the biggest problems are in science and in our lives that we need to crack, with a multi-million pound prize to then help us do that.’","Prime Minister signals u-turn on GM food to help feed the world .

"Mothers who have IVF are almost 50 per cent more likely to suffer pre-eclampsia during their pregnancy than those who conceive naturally, researchers say. A study in the U.S. found that pregnant women who have had fertility treatment are at greater risk of the condition, which can be lethal to mother and child. One of the most common causes of premature birth in the UK, pre-eclampsia affects 70,000 British women every year. Complication: Women who conceive using IVF are nearly 50 per cent more likely to suffer from pre-eclampsia. The condition affects 70,000 British women every year . It is characterised by high blood pressure and can lead to convulsions, blood clots, liver damage and kidney failure. Mothers who suffer from the condition are usually prescribed drugs to lower their blood pressure and told to stay in bed. Doctors hope such a treatment will reduce the stress on the baby and give it a chance to thrive before the birth, which usually involves a Caesarean section. Melinda Messenger, the television presenter, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, the singer, both had emergency surgery after pre-eclampsia diagnoses. They both delivered healthy sons, but many families are not so fortunate: pre-eclampsia claims the lives of up to 1,000 babies and ten mothers a year.

The placenta is the organ which provides a baby with oxygen and nourishment as it grows in the womb. Problems with the placenta can trigger further abnormalities in the mother's body during pregnancy, then the baby's, leading to pre-eclampsia. Charles Kingsland, of the British Fertility Society, said age could also be a factor in the development of the condition. He said that women who have IVF are often older than those who conceive naturally and may already have medical problems which increase their risk of developing it. He urged women having IVF not to worry but added: 'We need to be aware that in this group of patients, who may be older, who may have difficulty in getting pregnant, that it doesn’t follow that just because you have got pregnant that everything else is going to be easy.'","Condition affects about 70,000 UK women every year .

"Champion body builder Luke Wood is likely to have still died from a massive haemorrhage following a kidney transplant, even if doctors had seized on missed opportunities to treat him, a coroner has found. Mr Wood was eight weeks away from his wedding when he died at Sydney's Westmead Hospital from a massive internal haemorrhage on August 31, 2011. The 35-year-old had undergone a kidney transplant 11 days earlier, but his body soon started showing signs of rejecting the organ.

Days after a kidney transplant, Luke Wood, 35, collapsed at home on August 31, 2011. He rushed to Westmead Hospital in Sydney where he died from a severe haemorrhage, eight weeks before he was due to be married . Deputy NSW Coroner Sharon Freund drew on the evidence of Australia's longest-serving emergency department director Professor Gordian Fulde as she handed down her decision on Wednesday, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 'I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that unfortunately, though adequate, there were some missed opportunities in relation to Luke's care and treatment,' Ms Freund said. 'However, I am also of the view that had these opportunities been seized it is unlikely the ultimate outcome would have changed at the end of the day.' Mr Wood had undergone a kidney transplant on August 10, but on August 23 his body started showing signs of rejecting the organ. He was taken to hospital and given drugs as dark bruises appeared on his abdomen. He was discharged on August 26 and told to return for daily check-ups for a month, but died five days later when he collapsed at his home. His death had been examined by the NSW Coroner - with a particular focus on his treatment at Westmead Hospital. His fiance told reporters outside the Glebe Coroners Court on October 20 that his family feel cheated. 'Obviously there's something that's happened that they're trying to hide and we just want the truth to come out,' Nora Haddad said, with her sister and Mr Wood's sister at her side.

"Less than a week after a  video seemingly showing men trying to take advantage of a drunken woman on Hollywood Boulevard was revealed to be a hoax, the actress who took part in the marketing ploy issued an apology. Jennifer Box, a 24-year-old Los Angeles-based actress and model, took to YouTube Tuesday saying that she had been led to believe that she will be taking part in a 'light-hearted prank' when she was hired to portray a drunk girl. 'Had I known the damaging outcome of this video, I never would have participated,’ Box said. Scroll down for videos . Contrite: Actress Jennifer Box, 24, uploaded a video online apologizing for her participation in the now-infamous 'Drunk Girl in Public' video, which went viral last week before being revealed as a hoax . In the video, the actress (pictured) pretends to be drunk and approaches five different men on Hollywood Boulevard in order to ask for directions to her bus stop in what was marketed as a type of social experiment . Miss Box, who goes by the nickname ‘Jennifo,’ concluded her videotaped mea culpa by pointing out that all the men who pretended to prey on her were 'perfect gentlemen.' ‘So, from the bottom of my heart, I am very, very sorry for my participation in this production and any harm it may have caused,’ the striking brunette said into the camera. The 'Drunk Girl in Public' video was posted on YouTube November 11 and quickly became a hit with people across the internet expressing outrage at the several sober men who came up to the actress - who was pretending to be intoxicated while staggering down Hollywood Boulevard - and tried to coax her back to their homes. Just two days later, one of the men who appeared in the video came forward to reveal that the whole thing was staged by a viral marketing company and they were just following prompts from directors Stephen Zhang, 20, and Seth Leach. And when one of those men posted on Facebook to express his anger that he had been portrayed as a predator, one of the filmmakers tried to silence him with free drinks and the promise of future work. The real 'Drunk Girl': The woman in the video is a 24-year-old LA-based actress and model, who goes by the nickname 'Jennifo' Setting the record straight: Box said that she was hired to take part in what she had been told was a 'light-hearted' prank . Truth comes out: The striking brunette said that all the men featured in the video were 'perfect gentlemen' The video follows 24-year-old model Jennifer Box as she pretends to be seriously intoxicated, walking down Hollywood Boulevard and asking men for directions to the bus stop that will get her to Culver City. Shockingly, of the five men featured, only one actually offers her assistance, while the rest attempt to lure her back to their homes - despite her obviously drunken state. Two sources told The Smoking Gun that men in the video were approached on the street and asked to participate in a 'comedic, hidden camera' video. One man who decided not to appear in the video, says he was told it was a 'student video' and that it appeared they had no releases or paperwork to sign. Mike  Koshak is one of the men who agreed to participate in the video and is filmed in a blue tank top, telling the tipsy woman: 'You're in no shape to be walking around like this' before leading her in the direction of his home where there is 'more beer'. Mike Koshak, pictured right, said he was asked to participate in what he thought was a student video, in which he followed the direction of its creators . In the video, he is interrupted talking to the woman by another man who also then tries to take advantage of her . But both Mr Koshak and his boss deny the film's authenticity, saying he was just trying to help the student filmmakers out. Christine Peters is the owner of LA Epic, a company which arranges nightclub crawls, and she said Mr Koshak worked selling tickets to tourists. He was wearing a tank-top advertising the business when he was approached by the video's creators on the street to 'say a couple of lines for a comedy sketch.' 'They made it seem like he was trying to take the girl home,' she said, adding that her business does not  'condone such behavior.' Mr Koshak has also spoken out about the video on Facebook, writing that it 'was all staged and all of the people in it were acting'. The first man  (pictured) tries to lure Jennifer back to his apartment with the promise of a water bed. But the authenticity of the film has now been called into question after those who appeared in it say they were told they were acting in a student video . The video 'does not portray myself or any of the other people in it correctly,' he said, adding that it's a 'false a** portrayal and I was lied to about what the video even was. Faulty a*** shit.' After publishing the post, he says he received a private Facebook message from Mr Leach who tried to convince him to keep quiet. 'The important thing to consider is that this video is going to get you well known and have a future with us and our company,' he allegedly wrote. 'We are going to be huge and you are part of it,' Mr Leach also said, before inviting him out for a night of free drinks. 'Just go with it dude, you are in our team now and we will take care of you.' Mr Leach himself appears unconcerned about the latest claims. Last Tuesday, he boasted on Facebook about the video's success and to say he was leaving LA for a few days and will be 'creating some more viral videos for your viewing and learning pleasure'.

"Brain boost: evidence linking a cuppa with a reduction in cognitive decline . It's the national drink that millions of us turn to when we need a pick-me-up. But tea does far more than just help to wake us up. Scientists say the traditional cuppa can keep the mind sharp into old age. And the benefits of drinking as little as one to three cups a day in staving off mental decline are especially pronounced among women. In one study, of almost 1,500 men and women in Singapore, drinking more than four cups a day cut the odds of memory failing by three-quarters. Even just one to three cups of Ceylon tea a day had an effect, cutting the odds of cognitive decline by 43 per cent. It is thought compounds in tea may protect against the poisons that ravage the brain in Alzheimer’s. Possibilities include theanine, a plant chemical found only in tea and in mushrooms. Experts in the US analysed several studies on the effect of caffeinated drinks on memory and mental alertness. The thousands of men and women who took part logged how often they drank tea or coffee and did a memory test that is used in the initial stages of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. Up to ten years later, they resat the test and any fall in score was noted. The brain stayed sharper in those who drank tea in all the studies that included the drink, the journal Advances in Nutrition reports. A study which tracked 4,000 Americans for almost eight years suggested tea to be of particular benefit to women. The University of California researchers who reviewed the studies said the weaker results for coffee mean caffeine is unlikely to be responsible for the cognitive benefits. Tea leaves: Some of the compounds in tea may provide protection against the poisons that ravage the brain in Alzheimer's . Britons drink 165 million cups of tea every day  – making it more than twice as popular as coffee. Jessica Smith of . the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘There is building evidence linking a . cuppa and a reduction in cognitive decline. ‘However, we are a long way from being able to say for sure a regular brew will reduce your risk of developing dementia. ‘The best way to reduce your risk is to eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly and not smoke.’","Analysis of six different studies found drinking tea helped the brain to stay sharper .

"Thugs who attacked a British-owned bank in Argentina in a protest over the Falklands have threatened a repeat of the violence. Protestors say they will target a different British business every week in a chilling message set to heighten tensions between the two countries. More than 100 militants armed with wooden clubs threw paint bombs and sprayed 'English out of Malvinas' on the HSBC branch in Buenos Aires yesterday. Militant: Protesters hold Argentinian flags and banners with left-wing slogans after Prince William landed in the Falklands yesterday for a six-week mission with the Royal Air Force . Mob: Hoards of protestors wraped in Argentine flags and football shorts chant as they watch the Union Jack burn on the streets of Buenos Aires yesterday . Demonstrators burn a British flag outside the British embassy in Buenos Aires yesterday amid more threats that British businesses will be attacked . The ugly protest came as Prince William touched down in the Falkland Islands for a six-week tour of duty as an RAF search and rescue pilot amid Argentine claims it was an 'act of provocation.' The Duke of Cambridge received a warm . welcome as he landed in the disputed Falkland. In Argentina . however, violence broke out. Quebracho, a hardline left-wing group behind the HSBC protest, today vowed to repeat its actions. Quebracho leader Fernando Esteche, who . was jailed on charges stemming from political violence during a march . four years ago, pledged to target a British-owned business in Argentina . every week. Masked members of Quebracho group, brandishing clubs, march to protest against Prince William's military posting . Protesters gather in front of HSBC bank in Buenos Aires as Prince William touched down in the Falklands . Controversial: Prince William arrives on the Falkland islands aboard a Titan Airways Boeing 767 . Defence: The actual SAR Helicopter that Prince William will be flying when stationed in the Falklands . Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, pictured at the controls of a Sea King helicopter has been deployed to the politically sensitive Falkland Islands . Urging a damaging British business . boycott and attacking Prince William, he added: 'We call on the . Argentine people to boycott all British firms and the products they sell . in our country in a protest at the presence of the pirate prince.' Fellow militant Federico Lopardo predicted the next protest could attract as many as 500 supporters. He raged: 'Britain's imperialist policies have to be eradicated. 'This move to put the Falklands at the . forefront of their foreign policy is an attempt to distract public . attention from the economic and political crisis Britain is suffering.' The Duke of Cambridge's arrival, ahead . of a tour of duty as an RAF search and rescue pilot, comes as the Royal . Navy prepares to send one of its most advanced new warships to the . area. His arrival has already led to . controversy in Argentina which claims the prince will be wearing the . uniform of a 'conqueror' when he deploys. The Argentinean government said William's deployment was a distraction from Britain's 'internal problems'. Vice-president Amado Boudou told the . country's La Red radio station that the move was a case of 'bravado' to . mask high unemployment and the prospect of Scottish independence. His words follow reports that Buenos . Aires is putting pressure on a Chilean airline to stop weekly flights to . the Falklands which pass through Argentine airspace. David Cameron's official spokesman . said such 'threats' about the flights were 'not new,' adding: 'Clearly, we hope that that . flight will not be cut, but there are also RAF services from London to . the Falklands and these will continue.' Masked demonstrators lift their sticks during the protest against the arrival of Britain's Prince William to the Falkland Islands . Pedestrians walk by a graffiti which reads 'English, get out of .

A masked demonstrator hurls a bottle containing paint at the front door of the HSBC Bank branch . The Ministry of Defence said William's . six-week posting to the remote outcrop, which Buenos Aires calls Las . Malvinas, was part of a 'a routine operational deployment'.

'MOD can confirm Flight Lieutenant Wales, as part of a four-man Search . and Rescue crew, has arrived in the Falkland Islands on a routine . operational deployment and will shortly take up SAR duties post a period . of briefings and a familiarisation flight.' British firms operating in the south . American nation including Unilever and BP were last night bracing . themselves for violence after the threats. They were on a 'black list' of . British-owned companies operating in Argentina which was being . circulated on the Internet and social networking sites. Companies with links to Britain are also included on the list. The list was circulated alongside a . picture of the Union Jack with a skull and crossbones drawn over it . under the headline: 'Boycott the Pirates.' Argentine firms belonging to the . British-Argentine Chamber of Commerce, including two hotels and an . insurance broker, were also placed on the list. The Quebracho threat will be taken seriously because it has a track record of organising violent protests. The organisation's full name is the Quebracho Revolutionary Patriotic Movement. It defines itself as a revolutionary anti-imperialist movement. Its aggressive and confrontational tactics have brought it into conflict with other left-wing organizations. It has led violent demonstrations . against Israel and in support of Iranian dictator Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . and militant group Hezbollah. In April 2002 Quebracho members chased . an IMF delegate into the Buenos Aires he was staying in after following . him from the airport. They also protested against Prince . Charles visit to Argentina in March 1999 and destroyed dozens of shops . when George Bush flew into the country in 2005. Critics have described the organisation, which uses the slogan 'Fatherland or Death' as an 'enemy of democracy.' The Duke's deployment in the Falklands comes amid a diplomatic war of words between the British and Argentine Governments. Rising tensions between Argentina and . Britain over the disputed Falklands reached boiling point last month . when David Cameron claimed in the Commons the south American nation was . acting like a colonialist power over the islands. Prince William and Kate Middleton, who will not be joining her husband abroad . War of words: Argentina's president, Cristina Fernandez, has . attacked David Cameron's  'colonialism' statement, saying Britain . didn't have 'reasons or arguments' Acting president Amado Boudou . described Britain as the ultimate imperialist power and urged the PM to . 'go back to school and re-read his history books' Mr Cameron has insisted the islanders themselves must decide their future. The MoD announced earlier this week it was sending HMS Dauntless to the South Atlantic but insisted its deployment was routine. Prince William's Falklands posting led to him being branded 'a conqueror' by Argentina's Foreign Ministry. The heightened tensions come as . Britain tries to improve its diplomatic and business relations with . Latin American countries like Mexico and Brazil. Brazil has said it will stop . Falklands-flagged ships from docking its ports as part of a regional . agreement with Argentina and Uruguay despite increased business ties . with Britain. The Duchess of Cambridge will carry out her first solo public engagement next week, Clarence House said today. Kate will visit the National Portrait Gallery in London on Wednesday followed by a trip to Liverpool on Valentine's Day. The Duchess, a patron of the NPG, will visit its Lucian Freud Portraits exhibition on February 8. She will see a range of Freud's work, . including some of the artist's most important portraits from the 1940s . to the one he was painting shortly before his death in July last year. The following Tuesday, February 14, . Kate will travel to Liverpool in support of Alder Hey Children's . Hospital and the charity Action on Addiction, of which she is also . patron. She will tour an alcohol-free bar run . by the organisation before travelling to the hospital and meeting staff, . patients and their parents. Prince William opened an MRI facility during a visit to Alder Hey in February 2010. His wife will hear how the technology . has helped treatment patients, including children diagnosed with cancer, . when she visits the oncology unit. As well as the NPG and Action on . Addiction, the Duchess is patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices . and the Art Room, it was announced last month. Inner-city churches opened their doors . to the Prince of Wales today as he met priests who have made an impact . in their communities. Church of England reverends and Roman . Catholic priests met Charles as he visited places of worship in Camden . and Kentish Town, London. The heir to the throne visited the . churches to highlight the work of 'grassroots' clergy who have boosted . congregation numbers and engaged with their neighbourhoods. Throughout the day Charles was joined by the Bishop of London, Dr Richard Chartres, a personal friend and spiritual adviser. At St Silas, a Roman Catholic church . in Kentish Town, led by parish priest Father Graeme Rowlands, who has . increased congregation numbers from four when he took up his post in . 1989 to more than 100 today, the Bishop praised the work of the cleric. He said 'This is just one of a series . of visits the prince has made just to see what the grassroots reality is . - parts of London which very often hit the headlines for very different . reasons. 'People are working away year after . year in places like this, where very often where we were 10, 20 years . ago was tiny congregations and complete demoralisation - so the prince's . visit recognises the fact of how much has been achieved.' The Royal Navy's HMS Dauntless, which is being sent to the Falkland Islands, the Ministry of Defence said . Prince Harry is due to visit Brazil . next month ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War which . claimed the lives of 649 Argentines and 255 Britons. In the latest salvo, Argentina's country's Foreign Ministry said it 'rejected the British attempt to militarise (the) conflict' and expressed regret that an heir to the throne would arrive wearing 'the uniform of a conqueror'. David Cameron and Argentine president Cristina Fernandez have previously accused each other of 'colonial' behaviour, while Argentine official Sebastian Brugo Marco last year said the country could not ignore the 'political' implications of William's deployment. General Sir David Richards, the Chief of the Defence Staff, dismissed the claims, saying: 'I can absolutely tell you it wasn't and isn't designed to be.' William, who has worked as a Sea King pilot while based at his north Wales home on Anglesey, is following in the footsteps of his younger brother, Prince Harry, who was sent to Afghanistan as a forward air controller in 2008.","BP and Unilever braced for violence after anarchists circulate 'hit list'

"A transgender woman known as 'The Duchess' who performed illegal cosmetic surgery on women's buttocks could face up to a 100 years in prison if she is convicted of manslaughter. Oneal Ron Morris, 33, is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after she injected them with a mixture of substances including cement, bathroom caulk,  tire sealant and Super Glue, at homes in Florida. The most serious charge faced by Morris is manslaughter, after one of her 'patients' died from acute and chronic respiratory failure caused by the silicone used in the illegal surgery. Oneal Ron Morris - who earned herself the nickname ‘toxic tush doctor’ - now faces seven counts of practicing health care without a licence as well as one count of manslaughter . Morris - who earned herself the nickname ‘toxic tush doctor’ - now faces seven counts of practicing health care without a licence as well as one count of manslaughter, the Sun Sentinel reports. If convicted of all charges and sentenced consecutively, she faces up to 100 years behind bars. Shatarka Nuby, 31, who paid Morris $2,000 for as many as 10 injections, died in 2012 while serving a prison sentence for using fraudulent credit cards. Before she died, the mother wrote to the Florida Department of Health complaining about her severe medical problems, including the hardening and discoloration of her buttocks. Morris was arrested in 2011 for practicing medicine without a license with serious bodily injury after a patient complained the bogus doctor pumped tire sealant into her rear. Police say that up to 30 people from across the United States came forward with claims they were scammed by the bogus doctor after her arrest. Shaquanda Brown, of North Miami, told the Miami Herald she had to be hospitalized for over a month  after receiving the injections, and then continued to suffer from sickness. She said she recalled seeing a tube of Super Glue, a black hose and a syringe but she said Morris instructed her not to look so she continued to lay face down. She also said she remembered seeing Morris squeezing Super Glue onto gauze and placing the tape on the site of each injection, but the procedure stopped before she receive all of them, because they were so painful. Morris, who called herself 'The Duchess', also treated her own face and body with the toxic injections . According to the Herald, Ms Brown was admitted to a Tampa hospital shortly after, where she stayed for over a month to recover from a series of surgeries to treat multiple abscesses. She says she also contracted a staph infection. Ms Brown's story comes after another 'patient', Rajee Narinesingh, accused Morris of making her 'into a monster' after she received several procedures from the 'doctor' in 2005. Ms Narinesingh, a transgendered woman, wanted fuller lips, cheeks and chin, but could not afford an operation by a licensed plastic surgeon, using medical silicone. She said she had heard about the 'fake doctor' by word of mouth through the transgender community. After being injected with a cocktail of toxins she allegedly left with lumpen shapes in her cheeks, a misshapen chin and a ballooning upper lip. She later had to pay a real surgeon to repair the botched job. A court was told that Morris used Super Glue to patch up entry wounds in the skin. In October 2013, Morris accepted a plea deal of 366 days in prison for one count of the illegal practice of healthcare. On November 5 this year she was extradited to the Broward Main Jail where she is currently being held without bond.","Oneal Ron Morris, 33, left women ill and disfigured after the illegal surgery .

"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been accused of abusing his power after drafting a code of behaviour for asylum seekers that threatens to deport them for ‘irritating people, disturbing someone or spitting or swearing in public’. Australia’s tough stance over asylum seekers from Indonesia has soured relations between the two countries in recent months and this document is not likely to improve matters. The number of asylum seekers from Iran, Afghanistan, Myanmar and elsewhere reaching Australia in Indonesian fishing boats has soared in recent years and Australia has occasionally used its Navy to tow boats back to Indonesian waters. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been accused of abusing his power after his government drafted a controversial code of conduct for asylum seekers . Asylum seekers react as they are evacuated, many of those seeking asylum in Australia are from middle-eastern countries like Iraq . Now those who manage to make it to Australia’s shores will have to sign a new code of behaviour, currently in draft form, which sets out how they’re expected to behave. The document, which applies to those arriving by boat - or 'illegal maritime arrivals' - was leaked to The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. It states that they are banned from ‘irritating people’, ‘disturbing people’, ‘damaging property, spitting or swearing in public’ and ‘other actions that other people might find offensive’. ‘Spreading rumours’ at work or ‘excluding someone from a group or place on purpose’ are also banned. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said punishment for code of behaviour infringements could vary. It said: 'It could start with just a warning, you may have your Red Cross payments reduced or stopped all together or you may be placed in detention in Australia or offshore on Nauru and Manus Island.' An Australian frigate stands by as defence personel board an asylum seeker boat off of the coast of Christmas Island. Australia has had a recent bout of . Kon Karapanagiotidis, a spokesman for organisation, told The Telegraph: ‘No other industrialised nation criminalises everyday behaviour. The idea that spitting in public or getting a parking fine is enough to get you sent to an off shore detention centre is extraordinary. It is an abuse of power and creates a climate of terror for asylum seekers.’ The controversy follows news that an Indonesian court has sentenced a Pakistani man to seven years in jail for attempting to smuggle asylum seekers to Australia on a rickety boat that sank, killing about 90 people. Javaid Mahmood, 55, was the second person found guilty by the East Jakarta District Court in connection with the overloaded fishing boat that capsized on its way to Christmas Island in June 2012. Another 110 people on the boat were rescued. A panel of three judges concluded that Mahmood, also known as Billu, organized the voyage and conspired with an international syndicate that smuggled asylum seekers from Indonesia to Australia. The judges said each asylum seeker paid the people smugglers up to $5,150 to get to Australia. Last year, the court sentenced an Afghan man, Dawood Amiri, 20, to six years in prison and ordered him to pay $79,000. His interrogation led police to arrest Billu almost a year after the deadly voyage. Prosecutors, who had requested a 10-year sentence, said the defendant knew that the boat was overloaded but did nothing to stop it from sailing. He was among the survivors and had organized three previous trips to Australia. The judges also ordered him to pay $66,200 or face an additional six months in prison. Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa has criticized an Australia policy of turning back boats with asylum seekers as a violation of Indonesian sovereignty. Australia has apologized for incidents in which its border patrol boats entered Indonesian waters without permission, which had prompted Indonesia to demand that Australia suspend such operations against boats carrying asylum seekers. Indonesia has long been a transit point for people fleeing war-ravaged countries on their way to Australia.","Abbott has drafted a controversial code of behaviour for asylum seekers .

"Forget Delia Smith and Rebecca Adlington – there’s only one retirement of note this year. Mark Roberts, the world’s most prolific streaker, has stripped for the last time – and your intrepid reporter was there for his finale, wearing just a pair of Crocs.

I . would love to say that sitting naked on a bench in an icy . Buckinghamshire park was somehow a freeing experience. But, with my . modesty barely covered by an A4 notepad, I would be lying. Blue . with cold, I felt utterly ridiculous, a feeling not helped by the barks . of derision from passers-by. Mark, of course – pro that he is – took . the whole episode in his stride. But I was further discomforted to . notice that even he, unlike me, was wearing clothes, after a fashion: a . monkey G-string. ‘Isn’t that cheating?’ I asked. He . laughed: ‘I’ve shown my todger enough now, I think I’ve earned my . stripes. Anyway, it’s the buttocks that make people laugh.’ And . that’s the key to Mark’s 20-year ‘career’. Middle-aged with a proud pot . belly, he cuts a comical figure, wholly devoid of vanity. The title of . his planned autobiography says it all: I Didn’t Know An Inch Would Take . Me This Far. Tutu clever: Mr Roberts protected his modesty with a swimming cap and tutu when he jumped into the pool during World Swimming Championships in Barcelona in 2003 . ‘I’m no Muscle Mary or porn star,’ he . says. ‘That’s why it’s funny. I’m just a regular, 16st fella. If I was . buff, I’d just be a poser.’ His odd obsession began by accident in . 1993 when he saw a woman streak down the pitch at a rugby Sevens game . in Hong Kong. ‘I was working in a bar over there and I was a bit merry,’ he says. ‘When I saw that girl I said out loud, “Pah, anyone could do . that.’’ Some bloke replied, “OK, big mouth, you try it,’’ and I said, . “All right then.” ‘It was just ale talk. But the next . day there was a bang at the door and it was a mate with a taxi waiting. I . couldn’t back out then. ‘Everyone . was dancing and clapping at the stadium and I started getting a buzz . off the crowd – my heart was thumping through my chest. So I pushed to . the front and took my shoes and socks off. ‘I . ran backwards to wave to the crowd and, as I turned round, there was . the ball. I picked it up and ran the whole length of the field and . scored a try. Against the All Blacks. There and then, I was hooked.’ Therein . lies the nub of Mark’s compulsion: he loves to make people laugh. He . says: ‘My first time changed my life. Everyone should try it once. I’d . never had any history of nudity. I’m actually quite shy. On a beach, I’m . coy and I’ll get changed under a towel. But when I perform, I’m like a . different man. Cold front: In 1995 the Liverpudlian father of three leapt naked on to Fred Talbot¿s weather map on daytime TV show This Morning . ‘What I realised that day in 1993 was that while I could perhaps make four or five people laugh by telling a joke in a pub, I could, just by doing something daft on a pitch, make tens of thousands of people laugh. ‘I don’t have a compulsion to take my clothes off. It’s only the laughter that matters. It’s nothing like flashing. There’s nothing sexual about it – it’s just comedy nudity.’ Not everyone gets the joke. His scuffles with over-zealous security guards over the years have left him with two broken toes, four broken ribs, a broken finger and 25 stitches in his leg. In 2007, Merseyside Police sought an anti-social behaviour order banning Mark from displaying his buttocks and genitals in public. But the judge rejected the application, saying Mark’s behaviour did not cause real distress. That viewpoint is what marks him apart from Stephen Gough, the so-called Naked Rambler, who has spent six years in jail after walking the length of Britain in the nude. On one occasion, for example, Gough was jailed for a breach of the peace after a judge said he had ‘intentionally caused shock and alarm to children and their parents’ after he deliberately [walked] naked past a busy children’s play-park’ – despite ‘repeated police requests not to do so’. Not so super: Mr Roberst was carried off the field by Houston Police after he delayed the start of the second half of Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston, Texas in 2004 . ‘He thinks it’s his right to walk naked wherever he wants and that has clearly caused offence,’ says Mark. ‘I just set out to entertain people and always in a big arena. I’m no threat to anybody.’ But Mark has been kept in a cell overnight 30 times and fined a total of £4,000. Single for nine years, Mark has three children – Rebecca, 24, Mark, 19, and Georgia, 15 – by two different women but he no longer speaks to either of the mothers. It was a recent remark by son Mark that made him decide it was time to call it a day. Mark Snr says: ‘He said to me the other day, ‘‘Dad, when are you going to stop, all my mates are watching you?’’ I asked him, “What do they say?’’ ‘And he said, “They all laugh their heads off.’ So I replied, ‘‘What’s the problem, then?’’ He just said, “Well, you’re my dad.’’ That really hit home with me.’ Mark left school at 15, with no qualifications. Now jobless, he lives in a £400-a-month rented house in Anfield, Liverpool, but he is a strangely proud man. ‘I’m not on the dole, my mates are helping me out. I’ve always found a way to support me and the kids. And, streaking or not, I will again.’ Not that streaking has proved a big earner. ‘I made a couple of grand from underwear adverts in Spain ten years ago,’ he says. He is also the star of a Channel 4 documentary to be screened this week. So, unhappily, I joined him for his swansong – and he does have a point. There is, if our ad hoc audience is anything to go by, something inherently comical about two foftysomething blokes running across a park in the middle of February. As we thankfully reclaim our clothes after a streak that will be – for us both – our last, Mark says: ‘That’s it now, I’m done. But you always want more out of life, don’t you? You never know what’s on the other side of a door unless you open it. I’m ready.’ On the ball: Mr Roberts donned a tartan hat when he interrupted the Champions League final between Bayer Leverkusen and Real Madrid in 2002 .","Mark Roberts is giving up streaking after two decades .

"These remarkable images show some of the earliest known examples of what we these days might dub pornography. The Kangjiashimenji Petroglyphs, in Xinjiang, north-west China, depict an intense fertility ritual the likes of which is almost unique in the ancient world. That's because while most prehistoric art presents images that are abstract and disembodied, this tableau appears to explicitly present our sex-crazed ancestors in the midst of a wild orgy. Kangjiashimenji Petroglyphs: The first scene shows nine massive females, each about two metres high, dancing arond in a circle, while a second transexual figure on the left is partially reclining as if about to fall into a trance . The petroglyphs - thought to date back to the second millennium BC, although their exact age is difficult to determine - were discovered in the late Eighties by Chinese archaeologist Wang Binghua. Jeannine Davis-Kimball, an expert on Eurasian nomads, was the first Westerner to see them and detail them in scientific journals. Nevertheless they remain little known. One of her descriptions of the tableau is featured on the website of the Center for the Study of Eurasian Nomads, where she is currently executive director. The Kangjiashimenji Petroglyphs are . carved in bas-relief in a sheltered grotto, at the base of a massive . red-basalt outcrop in Tien Shan, about 45 miles west of Urumchi, the . capital of Xinjiang province. The . cast of about 100 figures, which range in size from more than nine feet . tall to just a few inches, are taking part in what is obviously a . fertility ritual. Almost all . are depicted in the same ceremonial pose, in which their arms are held . out and bent at the elbows with one hand pointing up and the other . pointing down. Location: The petroglyphs are carved in bas-relief in a sheltered grotto at the base of this red-basalt outcrop in Tien Shan, in Xinjiang, west China . 'In addition, human figures, floating heads, meandering dogs, static felines, and heraldic animals fill voids,' Dr Davis-Kimball writes. 'To the ancients each image most surely represented some aspect of the ritual.' It is believed that the larger-than-life hourglass figures that begin the tableau represent females, with their stylised triangular torsos, and shapely hips and legs. These figures wear conical headdresses with wispy decorations. Males, on the other hand, are depicted as smaller triangles with spindly stick legs, bare heads and mainly erect penises - dubbed 'ithyphallic' in archaeology speak. Many of the figures appear to depict transexuals combining both male and female features. Ithyphallic but wearing female headgear and chest decorations, they sometimes also wear masks and may depict shamans. 'In general, the figures are represented in a dance so intense that some have fallen into a trance or state of ecstasy,' writes Dr Davis-Kimball. 'Others are about to engage in sexual intercourse with the obvious intent of procreation as small embryonic images evoking chorus lines emphasise the significance of this act. 'The various animals add notes of ambiguity, yet provide additional clues to place the tableau in time and space and provide some historical basis.' She distinguishes eight separate scenes in the tableau, four of which are fully formed and the remainder of which appear to be sketches. Sex crazed: The second scene of the petroglyphs. It is believed that the larger-than-life hourglass figures that begin the tableau represent females, with their stylised triangular torsos, and shapely hips and legs . The first scene shows nine massive . females, each about two metres high, dancing arond in a circle, while a . second transexual figure on the left is partially reclining as if about . to fall into a trance. A 12-inch rock carving discovered in a cave in central Brazil is now the earliest-known art in the Americas. And with a phallus nearly as big as his arm, 'little horny man' is also testament that man was fascinated with his genitals even 11,000 years ago. The archaeologists who found the stick figure carving believe it is linked to a fertility ritual of the early residents of the region. They believe it could help shine light on exactly when prehistoric humans migrated to the New World. The carving was found in 2009 in Lapa do Santo -- a massive rock shelter where researchers from the University of São Paulo in Brazil had already dug up human bones, tools, ash from hearth and the ancient remainders of meals of fruit and small animals, according to Live Science magazine. The carving has been dated as being 9,000 to 12,000 years old. It is the only scene withoug ithyphallic men, although the transexual featured does have an erect penis. 'It . wears a female headdress with antenna and a “bra” ...' writes Dr . Davis-Kimball. 'Although its torso and legs are stylized as the male and . it is ithyphallic. 'Both arms, raised over its shoulders, have deviated from the normal dancing position. 'To complete the scene a single human head and two pairs of heraldic animals, probably goats — one pair markedly ithyphallic — are interspaced between the female dancers.' It is the second scene identified by Dr Davis-Kimball that appears to show the wildest orgy of all. In it sixteen figures - 10 female and six male - look set to begin having sex, with one particularly unusual one on the left wearing a monkey mask and probably representing a shaman. 'As it is ithyphallic it is also a bi-sexual representation and it appears that it about to copulate with a small female with splayed legs whose vulva is explicit,' she writes. Next to it is a headless male who looks like he's trying to have sex with another transexual figure. At the centre of the scene is another prominent transexual figure who appears about to have sex with a smaller female with splayed legs, whose private parts are quite explicitly rendered. Another large female figure seems to have two heads, and is positioned in the foreground as if leading the dance. Dr Davis-Kimball describes how it is stained stained red, 'perhaps suggesting heat'. Nearby, below the figure wearing the monkey mask, are a pair of ithyphallic striped feline animals surrounded by three bows which appear to have arrows which are about to be discharged. The third scene is smaller more . crudely rendered, containing nine figures, three female and six male, . all apparently about to have sex. Dr . Davis-Kimball identifies two images which stand out. 'First, the male . at the left with testicles and grossly exaggerated penis attempts to . mate with the second important figure, the adjacent female,' she writes. To this female’s left are three more males eager for their turn to have sex with her. Dr . Davis-Kimball adds: 'In this scene the importance of progeny is . emphasized with the portrayal of two rows of small anthropomorphic . figures.' The third scene: Many of the figures appear to depict transexuals combining both male and female features. Ithyphallic but wearing female headgear and chest decorations, they may depict shamans . Ancient: The final scene, which appears according to one writer 'a lot like a frat party'. It shows 14 characters, seven of which have erect penises, apparently in the midst of a frenzied dance . The final scene contains no obviously female figures at all, and one writer for Slate described it as looking 'a lot like a frat party'. It shows 14 characters, seven of which have erect penises, apparently in the midst of a frenzied dance. How they look in situ: Almost all the figures are depicted in the same ceremonial pose, with arms held out and bent at the elbows . Near the bottom is a single male, who appears to masturbating alone with a stream of babies emanating from his penis. Curiously for their location, all the figures presented in the Kangjiashimenji Petroglyphs appear to be Caucasoid, which fits in with other evidence which suggested the residents of this region of what is now China were nomads with European characteristics. Dr Davis-Kimball believes the tableau was probably some kind of storyboard for groups of cultic leaders that was used until about 850BC. '[This] interpretation of the tableau is reasonable as follows,' she writes. 'Many personages are represented, with about half being female (priestesses) and the other half being males (priests). 'Slightly more than half the males had assumed a bisexual gender role, being ithyphallic and cross-dressing as priestesses with high headdresses. 'All these personages are engaged in a ritual fertility/procreation dance with some engaged in symbolic copulation that would result in procreation. 'Lines of tiny images are, figuratively, the resulting progeny.' If she is correct, that makes ancient pornography rather more meaningful than today's.

"Immigrants are being granted permission to settle in Britain despite having ‘zero income and no employment’, a government inspector warned last night. The failure to carry out full background checks on the migrants undermines a key Home Office policy that applicants should be able to support themselves and their families without relying on the State. Foreign nationals who want to remain in the UK permanently are supposed to undergo strict checks by officials into their financial background. Scroll down for video . The chief inspector of immigration John Vine found potentially tens of thousands of applicants were approved without face-to-face interviews. As a minimum, they require enough money to pay for housing, plus a disposable income of more than £100 a week. But the chief inspector of immigration, John Vine, found potentially tens of thousands were having their applications rubber-stamped without either a face-to-face interview or HMRC investigation. An estimated one million migrants apply for permission to stay in the UK each year. But, incredibly, HMRC is willing to do only 3,000 checks a year for the UK Border Agency – just 250 every month. Such checks would establish if a migrant who claimed to be able to support themselves was telling the truth about their income or even having a job. As a result of the HMRC policy, officials are letting migrants stay without having had access to wages slips, P60 forms and other crucial data. Mr Vine, who carried out spot checks on a small sample of cases, said officials had granted permission to settle here despite the applicant having ‘zero income and no employment’. HMRC is only willing to do 3,000 checks a year for the UK Border Agency despite an estimated one million migrants applying for permission to stay in the country each year . He said the number of HMRC checks was ‘insufficient’ and must be urgently increased. Of 49 cases he looked at where . migrants were asking to stay on the grounds of marriage, not a single . person was interviewed. This is despite huge concern over sham . marriages. In other cases, . the application was decided while the husband or wife was still . overseas. Mr Vine said in one in every ten of such cases the decision . reached by immigration officials was ‘unreasonable’, mainly due to . insufficient evidence the migrant could afford to support themselves. The inspector raised his concerns in a report which focused on how UKBA handles cases involving marriage and civil partnerships. In . it, he also said there are currently more than 16,000 migrants waiting . to hear from border officials whether they can stay in Britain in yet . another ‘unacceptable’ UKBA backlog. Some . 14,000 applicants, growing at a rate of 700 a month, have already been . refused the right to stay but are pleading with officials to reconsider. An . additional 2,100 cases – shipped in a box from a UKBA office in Croydon . to Sheffield – are still waiting for an initial decision, some dating . back a decade. Mr Vine said: ‘This is completely unacceptable and I . expect the Agency to deal with both types of case as a matter of . urgency. John Vine said immigrants were being granted permission to settle despite having 'zero income and no employment' Ferry passengers caught entering Britain with cocaine in their luggage are being let off with just a small fine. Instead . of arresting and prosecuting, border officials are routinely . confiscating the drugs, allowing passengers to pay around £100 and then . letting them carry on their journey. John . Vine, chief inspector of Borders and Immigration, said the approach was . unlawful and anyone caught with Class A drugs should be put before a . court. His report into . border controls found two occasions where a small amount of cocaine was . discovered on a passenger or in their luggage coming into Dover via . Calais. Both cases involved less than 1g of the drug. Under . customs laws, passengers caught with small amounts of Class B and C . drugs can pay a ‘compound settlement’, have the drugs confiscated and . escape prosecution. But . that law does not extend to Class A drugs. Anyone caught entering with . even small amounts of heroin, cocaine or ecstasy must be arrested and . can face a lengthy prison sentence. The . report said: ‘Although the amount was small, we were concerned that in . one case investigators advised a compound settlement for the offence, . given that this was contrary to Border Force’s own guidance. ‘Border . Force subsequently informed us that they had revised their guidance to . reiterate that class A drugs fall outside the scope of compounding.’ ‘Delays also mean . enforcement action is likely to be more difficult in the event the case . is ultimately refused. This is because the individual will have been in . the UK for a number of years and may have developed a family or private . life.’ He also said the . percentage of successful appeals in marriage cases was too high, at 53 . per cent from April 2011 to February last year. Mr Vine told Radio 4's Today programme this morning: 'Work is being transferred but missed or lost. The organisation should know what its own backlog and workload is, then it can prioritise. 'I was concerned at the high rate of appeal.' He admitted that 13 per cent of cases remained unresolved. Mark Harper, Minister of State for Immigration, told the show that the 14,000 outstanding appeals had not been done through the proper channels. 'We went and just allowed people to say, ""can you just go through it again?"" They should have given a clear message. 'We inherited an agency with a lot of problems.' Sir Andrew Green, of . Migration Watch, said: ‘This is yet further evidence of the chaos in the . immigration system.’ UKBA . said last night: ‘We are working with HMRC to increase the number of . searches we can do against their systems. Since this report we have . brought in strict new rules on proving income levels to make sure that . those bringing in family members are able to support them.’","Chief inspector of immigration John Vine said many had 'zero income'

"Ronny Deila tore into his Celtic players after their Champions League hopes were blown to pieces by Henning Berg’s Poles. The Scottish champions now require a miracle at Murrayfield next week if they are to stay in Europe’s premier competition following an abysmal performance which saw Efe Ambrose dismissed on the stroke of half-time. After Callum McGregor gave Celtic an early lead, two goals from Miroslav Radovic and one apiece from Michal Zyro and Jakub Koseci saw Legia Warsaw shoot down the visitors - and remarkably the scoreline could have been even worse had Ivica Vrdoljak not missed a penalty and had a second one saved by Fraser Forster. Humiliated: Celtic's players trudge off the pitch after they were comfortably beaten on Wednesday night . With Celtic needing a 3-0 win in the unfamiliar surroundings of the national rugby stadium, furious fans will be questioning the logic of handing over Celtic Park over for the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. Angered by a ‘poor’ display and ‘stupid mistakes’, Deila said: ‘It was a very poor performance and worst of all was the commitment, the energy. I need much more energy in the game. We didn’t stay together for 90 minutes. ‘We started well and got the first goal but then gave way to pressure and lost our heads. We started giving the ball way in midfield so many times and mistakes in the back four, some were high, some were low, instead of being together. ‘But what is done is done, we have to learn from this very quick. We got the away goal and we still have a chance. Pandemonium: Legia Warsaw's players go wild after Miroslav Radovic scores his first goal . ‘It is possible to win 3-0 again - like we did last year in the play-off - and with the help of the supporters we will do everything we can to do that. ‘But we have to learn from this week. We need a whole different attitude and discipline in our play.’ The Norwegian did not excuse himself from blame and vowed to make himself clearer in his instructions ahead of the second leg, insisting his team should not have gone on the offensive after Radovic put the Poles in front just before half time. ‘It was not the plan to go forward at 2-1. We had a spell when we had good control but started making stupid mistakes and they got space behind us. Mountain to climb: Deila must somehow inspire Celtic to overcome the three-goal deficit . ‘That is my responsibility. I have to be much clearer as to what I expect and how we perform as a team, defensively and offensively, and tonight we lost our heads and that is not good enough.’ Deila was not too harsh on Ambrose whose defending was ropey before he was sent off for a ‘last man’ challenge on Mical Kucharczyk. ‘It is not only that situation, it was a consequence of many situations. We lost the ball too much in middle, the back four was not together and when we lost the ball we were too open. ‘We made it difficult for ourselves and in the end they got a counter-attack and Efe went in, but it was a more of a consequence of bad defending.’ Long journey home: Celtic fans will not be please with what they saw from their side . Legia boss Berg was delighted by the way his side kept going despite missing two penalties. ‘We didn’t feel sorry for ourselves, we pushed and got more goals and we could have scored more,’ said the former Rangers player. ‘It is not normal to miss two penalties, especially for Ivica as he has never missed for me. Ivo was confident but that is football. But I am very happy with the way we played and so happy for my players to show what we can do in a game like this.’","Celtic beaten 4-1 by Legia Warsaw in Champions League qualifier .

"Coffee chain Caffe Nero is to remove a poster from its branches that shows three men leering at a woman’s behind after customers complained it was sexist. The large illustration depicts two of the men lifting their sunglasses to peer at the backside of a lone woman as she walks by. Bosses at Caffe Nero – Britain’s third largest coffee-house chain with 500 cafes – say the image was supposed to ‘portray Italian culture’. But they now concede it may cause offence, and say it will be removed from all stores as soon as possible. Caffe Nero plans to remove dozens of these 'sexist' posters, which show three men ogling a woman in the street . A Caffe Nero branch. Chiefs say they have removed the offending poster after complaints it was sexist . Teacher Laura Palmer, 32, was visiting Caffe Nero in Ashford, Kent, with a group of new mothers when she spotted the print. She said: ‘I think it’s a really inappropriate image, which in my view promotes sexual discrimination and the sexualisation of women. It has undertones which are almost creepy – three guys standing by the side of the road in a pack with their eyes obviously drawn to the woman’s behind. I decided to complain. Foaming with anger: It had been claimed the poster portrayed everyday Italian life - instead it was accused of 'everyday sexism' ‘I was extremely shocked to be faced with such blatant leering at women. It just isn’t the sort of image Nero should be promoting.’ Writer Laura Bates, founder of the online Everyday Sexism Project which records women’s real-life brushes with sexism, said it was only right that the chain was taking the matter seriously. She said: ‘Some people will dismiss this as being a very minor issue, but behaviour like this is something that impacts on the lives of thousands of women and girls up and down the country. Being harassed in the street isn’t a harmless compliment – it can be scary, uncomfortable and have a real impact on women’s lives.’ However, Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke said he could not really understand what all the fuss was about. He said: ‘I have never had anyone come to me with an issue like this – and I have to admit that I don’t think the general public care that much.’ In an email response to Ms Palmer’s complaint, a customer service worker for Caffe Nero said: ‘This is one of 1,000 images we use in our stores, designed to portray Italian culture. But I can see how this might cause offence, which was never intended.’ Caffe Nero spokeswoman Ceri Aiken said: ‘We have stopped actively using this image, meaning it is no longer used in new stores, or existing stores given a refresh. We are also in the process of removing the image from stores where it is displayed.’","Chain claimed men ogling a woman's backside represented 'Italian culture'

"A leading force in football's battle . against racism has been criticised after he called an Asian supporter a 'coconut'. Piara Powar, who is the . executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) organisation, has been a vocal figure in the game's recent rows. But an exchange on Twitter has left Mr Powar, who is also Asian, embroiled in a race controversy of his own making. Outburst: In a Twitter exchange Piara Powar, executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe, sparked fury by telling Asian football fan Parmjit Singh not to be 'a coconut' Liverpool fan Parmjit Singh, 34, tweeted . @piarapower: 'Interesting how u haven't given your opinion on the news that a . £mufc fan was arrested on Wednesday for alleged racial abuse.' He received a staggering reply from Mr . Powar, who used Twitter's private messaging function to contact Mr Singh, which . said: 'Get lost Singh. Have no false consciousness. Don't be a coconut.' Mr Singh was referring to Manchester United fan Howard Hobson, 57, who was today fined £200 for chanting racist abuse at a black Stoke City player during a match on January 31. Mr Powar had earlier condemned Liverpool FC and . the way it handled the Luis Suarez affair - where the striker was banned for eight games after being found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra during a match against Manchester United in October. Manifesto: In a statement on its website FARE sets out the organisation's aim to tackle racism at all levels of the game . And Powar also condemned the alleged racist abuse by a Liverpool supporter towards Oldham Athletic's Tom Adeyemi last month.A 'coconut' is an extremely derogatory . term used to accuse someone of betraying their heritage by pandering to 'white' opinion. It stems from a coconut being brown on the . outside and white on the inside. Mr Singh, a postman from the West . Midlands, is appalled by Mr Powar's comments and has branded him a 'hypocrite'. Use of the 'coconut' label also caused outrage two years ago. In 2010, Shirley Brown, a black Liberal . Democrat councillor, used the phrase to describe her Tory opponent, Jay Jethwa, . after she backed spending cuts for ethnic minority projects at a Bristol City . Council meeting. Brown was found guilty of racially . aggravated harassment and given a 12-month conditional discharge. He said: 'At first I was shocked because . in all my life I have never been called a coconut. 'I've been called p**i, a rag head and . other racist names by non-Asians but never a coconut. 'It is more insulting to me to be called a . coconut than a rag head because some of the people who used that term are just . ignorant. 'But for one Asian to call another Asian . man a coconut is like being called a traitor. It is like saying you're . betraying your own race or roots, in my opinion.' Mr Powar, who has been criticised by a . number of football fans for his 'coconut' jibe, has now 'protected' his Twitter . account so only his followers can read his tweets. Mr Singh added: 'I think he is a hypocrite . and a person who has an agenda against Liverpool FC. He didn't comment on the . Man United fan who was arrested. 'If he is against racism then he shouldn't . be selective on who he chooses to condemn.' A spokesperson for FARE and Mr Powar . declined to comment. Man United fan fined £200 for racist chant and . monkey noises during game . Manchester United fan Howard Hobson outside Trafford Magistrates' Court today . A Manchester United fan who hurled racist . abuse at a black player was today fined £200 and banned from football matches . for three years. Howard Hobson, 57, shouted: ""You f*****g . w**! You f*****g n*****!"" and made monkey noises at Stoke City's Trinidad-born . player Kenwyne Jones. Hobson was in the North Stand at Old . Trafford for the game against Stoke on January 31, Trafford Magistrates Court . heard. The defendant was asked to explain his . actions after pleading guilty to a single charge of a racially . aggravated public order offence. 'I'm not racist,' he told the bench. 'I have coloured people in my family and . most of my best mates are coloured. I don't know what came over me. I'm deeply . sorry.' Eileen Rogers, prosecuting, told the court . Hobson's behaviour was brought to the attention of club stewards at the match . by a witness sitting near the defendant. 'The match started - sitting a short . distance away, he heard words being uttered,' Ms Rogers said. Hobson, 57, who hurled racist abuse at a black player, was fined £200 and banned from football matches for three years. He is seen here leaping a fence after leaving court today . 'During the first half, every time the . Stoke City player Kenwyne Jones was tackled, or went down with injury, all of a . sudden he heard voices shouting, ""You f*****g w**, you f*****g n*****"". 'Plus also he was shouting various . utterings of monkey towards the player. 'The comments were directed to the Stoke . City player Kenwyne Jones, a player who originates from Trinidad.' Hobson shouted: ""You f*****g w**! You f*****g n*****!"" and made monkey noises at Stoke City's Trinidad-born player Kenwyne Jones (above) After the half-time interval when Hobson . returned to his seat, he was spoken to by stewards and taken away and then . transferred to a police station in Salford. Hobson, of Openshaw, . Manchester, who is not a season ticket holder at Old Trafford, told officers he . had come to the match straight from his job as a fork lift truck driver and . drank four bottles of beer but was not drunk.

"As far as creative punishments go, this one is pretty good. Or bad. A video of a US couple telling their son he has Ebola as a joke has gone viral with nearly two million views in two days.

At this point, the boy screams in terror and bursts into tears at the news while his younger brother runs off. It was subsequently uploaded to YouTube, where the prank has divided viewers, with some proclaiming it is 'cruel' and 'heartless' and others defending it as 'hilarious'. One user commented: 'It's not the prank that boils my blood, but the fact they recorded it then uploaded it to the public on the web as a light-hearted joke.'

"From the horrors of the Blitz to kamikaze attacks in the Pacific, World War II inflicted terrible suffering on troops and civilians alike. But as these photos reveal, soldiers fighting the war, whether in the Far East or Europe, did enjoy some more light-hearted moments. Hidden away in the attics of former servicemen for more than 60 years, the pictures, which show soldiers from the UK, Australia and the USA among others, shed fresh light on the friendships fostered between the men who fought. Enjoying themselves: A group of soldiers indulge in an al fresco (and au naturel) dip on a day off . Multi-tasking: A trio of British soldiers enjoy a convivial chat while cleaning up in a makeshift shower . Scrubbing up: A group of British soldiers enjoy a shower (left) while another takes a snooze (right( . The photos, which appear in a new book, My Buddy: World War II Laid Bare, are drawn from an archive created by Los Angeles based photographer, Michael Stokes, which contains more than 500 images of off-duty World War II soldiers. His extensive collection includes snapshots of soldiers and . sailors from Australia, the UK, France, Italy, Poland, Russia, and the . USA, cavorting on the sand in the South Pacific, shivering in the snow . of Eastern Europe, posing solo in the barracks, and in great happy . groups. Many are barely out of . boyhood, at their physical peak and are responding to the reality of battle by . living each day to the fullest. What's more, as the photographs reveal, 'buddy' relationships enjoyed by troops from all nations were an essential part of life on the front line - and even boosted soldiers' ability to fight. Having a splashing time: A group of solders pose for a photo during a lull in the fighting in the South Pacific . Oooh matron! Soldiers line up for a medical while another horses around and waves his bits at the camera . According to Stokes, commanders encouraged troops to form close relationships with one another, gaining, in the process, an important form of emotional support. Many of these friendships survived the end of the war, with men forging close bonds as they fought - and relaxed - side by side. While some of the more risque photos might come as a shock, they do offer a glimpse of the lighter side of life on the front line. Sadly, for many of the men enjoying a lazy day on the beach or macho fun in the barracks, these would be the last joyful moments of a life about to be cut short.

"With her long blonde hair, glowing skin and elegant sense of style, Beverley, from Kent, looks far younger than her 64 years. But there's more to the Kent grandmother than meets the eye. Although she looks like any other retiree, Beverley, or Bev as she likes to be called, is a working escort. One of a growing number of pensionable prostitutes, Bev is part of a select group of elderly sex workers that counts the likes of Amsterdam's Fokkens sisters and Katie Waissel's grandmother, Sheila Vogel, among their number. Glamorous: 64-year-old grandmother Beverley still works as an escort, which, she says, pays her bills . Bev's career in prostitution began more than 30 years ago when her husband, a compulsive gambler, played one round too many and left Bev and her children destitute. Although financially stable now, Bev says she will continue to work as an escort for as long as she has bills to pay but adds that she would give it up if she could. 'I started out because my husband was a . gambler and we lost everything,' she explains in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'Then I saw an advert in the paper for . escorts so I went for an interview and they told me to start right . away. 'I thought it was just going to be dinners and things but I got . into the car and this man enlightened me on what was actually going to . happen.' Gambling: Beverley's career began 30 years ago after her husband's gambling left the family destitute . Bev, who says she has never worked as a street prostitute, says the career did take some getting used to but says there are some benefits. 'It does take some getting used to,' she reveals.' Essentially you are using your body and it is a bit like selling a piece of . meat. 'It's just a job like working in a post . office. It's a bit like social services in the way that you have to analyse . people.' According to Bev, who appears on Channel 4 documentary, My Granny The Escort, analytical skills prove particularly useful when deciding which men to take on as clients. 'I have had some really lovely clients . and most of them are single, although there are a few that are married,' she explains. 'I have . never suffered any violence - I won't have it. You just have to look . at the client and watch out for drink and drugs, you just have to be . aware.' Making sure you're aware of what's going on is something she regularly says to younger escorts, many of whom she takes under her wing. Sister act: Louise (left) and Martine Fokkens worked in Amsterdam's Red Light District for more than 50 years . Still working: Katie Waissel's granny, Sheila Vogel, continues to work as an escort despite being 85 years old . 'I tell them to just be careful . because you are very vulnerable,' she reveals. 'There are lots of things I won't do . that these younger girls will, I won't put myself or my family in those . situations. I always do things my way.' Bev's clients, many of whom are in their 20s, also prefer a gentler approach with few asking for anything extreme. 'I . asked a guy the other day why he wanted to see an older woman and he . said it was all to do with the fantasy,' she explains. 'They say they like an older lady . because she knows what she's doing and they know that they are in safe . hands and won't grab hold of them too hard. They don't want me to be . naughty.' Announcement: Sheila Vogel said her granddaughter's X-Factor stardom ruined her escorting career . Risque: Sheila Vogel with her granddaughter, 2010 X-Factor contestant, Katie Waissel (pictured right) Perhaps that's why, for now at least, Bev says she's happy to carry on with her escort work. 'I still enjoy my job,' she reveals. 'I . enjoy meeting people. Everyone always says that the sex must be the . best part but not everyone has sex because they don't want to commit . adultery. I would say that around one in five clients have sex. 'Everyone has bills . to pay so that's why I still do it but I do enjoy it.' She adds, smiling broadly: 'I could go back . to lorry driving, I did do that for a while.'

'When the Member for Stuart says that our families want our . young people locked up, because prisons; they're safe places, it's where . people can dry out for three months, it's a safe environment and where, . sadly, a lot of family members are in there, so they're not alone.' Controversial: Price said that jail had benefits for young Aborigines. 'While they are being imprisoned, they don't get to drink, they don't get into trouble' She told Parliament she was saddened by Ms Price's statement and said it painted a disturbing scenario. The North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency (NAAJA) says the comments by Ms Price reflect a sad state of affairs according to ABC. Several people took to Twitter to voice their annoyance at her comments. @NATSILS who describe themselves as 'the peak body for Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Legal Services' wrote on their Twitter page 'Bess Price how wrong you are.

"Officials working at London Underground were forced to apologise after a quote from alleged rapist Bill Cosby was posted at a tube station. Cosby has been accused of sexually abusing 14 women and raping at least three - one more than 40 years ago. A board placed at Tooting Bec tube station in south London, which staff use to post a 'thought of the day' to cheer up commuters, featured a quote from Cosby. Tube officials were forced to apologise for using a quote from alleged rapist Bill Cosby for their 'thought of the day' at Tooting Bec underground. The board is used to cheer up commuters but caused offence . The whiteboard said: '''A word to the wise is not necessary. It's the stupid ones that need advice"" - Bill Cosby.' It was placed in such a position that everybody exiting through the barriers at the busy Northern Line Tube station, in south west London, saw it on Monday. George Taylor, 28, a commuter, said: 'It's wholly inappropriate. 'Bill Cosby hasn't been relevant for years, and all of a sudden, when the focus is on him over monstrous sex allegations, some clever-clogs decides to quote him.' Transport for London has apologised for the 'misjudged' quote. Pat Hansberry, London Underground's General Manager for the Northern line, said: ''We acknowledge that the 'thought of the day' quote at Tooting Bec station was misjudged. 'I apologise to any customers who were offended and I will ask our staff to be more careful in future.' Bill Cosby has been accused of sexually abusing 13 women in the past but his lawyer said he would not dignify historic discredited claims with a response . Cosby has faced historical allegations of sexual abuse. In November 2006 he settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his mansion two years earlier. Her lawyers said they had the names of 13 other women who had come forward voluntarily with similar accounts of drugging or abuse at the hands of Cosby. But the settlement was reached before the women gave evidence. Last month Barbara Bowman said she was one of these women and alleged she had been drugged and raped by Cosby in 1985 when she was 17-years-old. Joan Tarshis has also claimed she was drugged and raped by the TV actor in 1969 when she was an aspiring 19-year-old actress in Hollywood. When asked about the latest allegations by Ms Tarshis the comedian's lawyer said he will not 'dignify' allegations with a response and has said some of the claims have been discredited. Cosby has never been criminally charged in any of the cases. During an interview at the weekend Cosby remained silent when asked about the allegations.","Officials posted Bill Cosby quote about advice at Tooting Bec tube station .

"At the 1982 World Cup the only way Italy managed to stop Diego Maradona was to task their hard-nosed centre-back Claudio Gentile with man-marking the diminutive star. Gentile committed 23 fouls on Argentina’s No 10 in Spain, as Italy triumphed 2-1 and left their opponents needing to beat Brazil in their next match to advance - something they failed to do. Thirty-two years later there were echoes of that famous hatchet job during Brazil’s match against Colombia in Fortaleza, as Fernandinho thundered into James Rodriguez at every opportunity to disrupt the Colombian’s rhythm. VIDEO Scroll down to watch James Rodriguez star in adidas 'all in or nothing' advert . Where's the ball? Fernandinho clatters into James Rodriguez in the first half of the match in Fortaleza . Agony: Rodriguez is left writhing in pain after Fernandinho's first foul in Fortaleza .

"Tony Smith CBE, who retired from the UKBA last month, says authorities have no clear idea about immigrants in this country . The newly-retired boss of Britain's Border Agency has admitted that immigration to this country was out of control under Labour and  politicians have no idea 'who is here and who isn't'. Tony Smith, who retired from the UK Border Force last month, blamed the problem on a surge of illegal immigrants who came to the country between 2000-2003. He said: 'There was a huge influx and frankly I don't think we have ever recovered from that'. Speaking as ministers . attempted to tackle a backlog of 750,000 cases, Mr Smith . said the problem began over a decade ago when immigrants flooded in. He said that after they arrived, many then changed their names and were now undetectable by authorities. In a forthright newspaper interview today, Mr . Smith, who was awarded the CBE this year for the work he did on security at last summer's Olympics, said it was difficult for border officials to cope with such a . huge influx of people, adding: 'There's little you can do other than . take their details and pass them on.' His candid comments come days after . Home Secretary Theresa May killed off the Border Agency after five years . of catastrophic failure. The . agency behind a string of immigration scandals was cut in two and . brought under Home Office control as Mrs May condemned the agency, set . up under Labour, as suffering from a 'closed, secretive and defensive . culture'. Former UKBA chief Tony Smith said immigration was out of control under Labour between 2000-2003 . The Home Secretary said the enormous backlog of 320,000 cases would take 24 years to clear. In today's interview with The Sun, Mr Smith said the immigration problems could have been avoided with the introduction of ID cards and passport finger-printing. He . said Mrs May's changes, which involve the Border Agency being split . into two organisations, one to deal with visas and the other to track . down illegal immigrants, would help combat the problem. The . UK Border Agency was created in 2008 to replace the Immigration and . Nationality Directorate in the Home Office, a department which was . already in chaos, with asylum claims piling up, and staff badly . demoralised. Former head of the UKBA Brodie Clark, left, was removed by Home Secretary Theresa May, right, last year . At one point 100,000 letters were found to be unopened and some 14,000 applicants had already been refused the right to stay but were still pleading with the UKBA to reconsider. In 2011 Mrs May removed Brodie Clark, the Agency's head, after discovering that Britain's passport checks had been removed without sanction. And she finally killed the Agency off last month . after five years of failure under Lin Homer, the mandarin who led the . UKBA from its inception. Despite . the crisis after crisis that typified the UKBA under her control, Ms . Homer has now gone to a £180,000-a-year role with HM Revenue and . Customs. In an unprecedented speech in the . House of Commons last month, Mrs May laid the blame for the agency’s . failings firmly at Labour’s door, saying it was unable to cope with . the number of migrants admitted by the last Government. She indicated she would pass new laws to remove illegal immigrants and foreign criminals from Britain. Mrs May told MPs: 'UKBA was given Agency status to keep its work at an arm’s length from ministers. That . was wrong. It created a closed, secretive and defensive culture.’ On April 1, the UKBA was divided into . two sections, one to deal with immigration visas and one to deal with . immigration law enforcement. Tip of the iceberg: Illegal immigrants sleeping rough in a camp under the M4 near Heathrow . Mrs May said the latter department . would have 'law enforcement at its heart and get tough on those who . break our immigration laws'. She said she was returning . responsibility for controlling immigration to the heart of the Home . Office after a backlog of 300,000 immigration cases built up which would . take 24 years to work through. Her no-nonsense moves came after a scathing report by the Home Affairs Select Committee which revealed ministers had not been given correct information about the scale of the problem for years and accused the Agency of incompetence and foot-dragging. Last year it emerged that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers were allowed to stay here without proper checks after their cases were put into storage and little or no effort made to trace the individuals concerned. A Government inspector discovered that some 124,000 cases were put on one side, of whom it later emerged that 37,500 people could have been easily located and potentially expelled from the country. The now-defunct UK Border Agency was typified for a stream of crises in which thousands of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers were allowed to remain here . A further 10,000 cases classified as having ‘legal barriers to removal’ had, in fact, just never been opened. Officials also repeatedly misled Parliament over what was happening, according to John Vine, the chief inspector of Borders and Immigration. Other scandals at the Agency included half a million people travelling by Eurostar let in without being checked against a list of murderers and terrorists, expensive biometric passport machinery turned off on 15,000 occasions, and students waved through without their visas being examined. Tony Smith was appointed Director General of the UK Border Force in September 2012 after ensuring the Olympics passed by trouble-free. He had already had a career at the Home Office spanning several decades, having served as head of ports and borders in both Canada (2000-03) and the UK (2005-07). In 2007 he became the first regional director for the UKBA in London and the South East, and in 2010 he was appointed the first full-time Senior Responsible Owner for the UKBA Olympic Programme. Last year Mr Smith became the joint UKBA/Border Force Gold Commander for the London Olympics.  After his retirement last month, he became a consultant on global border security issues.","Ex-UKBA head Tony Smith blames massive influx under Labour in 2000-2003 .

"Posted pictures of himself with Bill Clinton and Silvio Berlusconi . Called for a 'boycott' of Arab businesses . The Israeli prime minister's 19-year-old son posted disparaging and obscene comments about Arabs and Muslims on his Facebook page, an Israeli paper reported today. Earlier this year, Yair Netanyahu posted that Muslims 'celebrate hate and death,' the Haaretz daily reported. After Palestinian assailants entered a West Bank settlement and stabbed five members of an Israeli family to death, he wrote that 'terror has a religion and it is Islam.' Facebook blunder: Yair Netanyahu, right, seen with his father Benjamin and brother Avner at the Western Wall, is reported to have made the disparaging comments online . Yair Netanyahu, the eldest of the prime minister's two sons, is currently a soldier in the Israeli military's media liaison unit. But a lawyer for the Netanyahu family, David Shimron, defended teh soldier, insisting in a statement that the comments were those of a 'teenager' and were 'taken out of context in an attempt to defame the prime minister and his family.' According to the Haaretz report, the prime minister's son also ran a Facebook group that called for a boycott of Arab businesses and products, and used obscenities to describe Arabs. He was 17 at the time. The group had a total of 23 members, the paper reported. In another comment, he wrote that there had never been a Palestinian state and that he hoped 'there would never be one.' Haaretz said the comments in question were removed within two hours of the paper's request for a response from the prime minister's representatives. Out of context: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's lawyer says the comments were 'taken out of context' The younger Netanyahu's Facebook page also included comments on the Israeli version of the TV show Big Brother and a 'like' directed at Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli, alongside photos of himself with world leaders like Bill Clinton and Silvio Berlusconi. A military spokesman said commanders had spoken to Netanyahu ""to clarify to the soldier the military commands, outlining his mistakes, as would be done with any soldier in a similar situation."" Some of the comments predated his military service, the military said. Shimron, the Netanyahu family's attorney, slammed Haaretz for reporting the comments. 'Bringing them up now is ridiculous and shows the cynical use of the words of a teenager, said in anger, when he could not imagine that someone would someday make use of them,' the lawyer wrote. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu and his wife believe in moderation and tolerance, and they respect all people without regard for their religion, origin or nationality and that is how they raise their children,' the statement said. The families of Israeli leaders have typically been kept out of the spotlight, but Netanyahu's family has sometimes drawn media attention in ways that have been a liability for the Israeli leader. Sara Netanyahu, the prime minister's third wife, has been criticized for allegedly mistreating her household staff and for meddling in state affairs. She has denied the accusations.","Posted pictures of himself with Bill Clinton and Silvio Berlusconi .

"Wildlife presenter Chris Packham was reprimanded by the BBC for tweeting his views on the culling of badgers. Mr Packham branded government officials 'brutalist thugs, liars and frauds' in a series of tweets. He posted the tweets at the end of August on the eve of a cull to stop the spread of bovine tuberculosis. Chris Packham has been reprimanded by the BBC after tweeting his views on the summer badger cull . Another one of the tweets read: 'I feel sick, sad disempowered, betrayed, angry and crushed by the corruption of all that I know is right.' BBC bosses launched an investigation into the tweets following a complaint by the Countryside Alliance which claimed they went against BBC impartiality rules. It found that Mr Packham breached a BBC voluntary code of conduct as the tweets were not politically neutral. The Telegraph reported that in a memo on the issue Tim Scoones, a executive producer for the BBC Natural History Team said: While Chris' recent programme, the Burrowers (broadcast in August) did not touch on the badger cull issue, we accept that the timing of these tweets was not in the spirit of this voluntary code. The tweets were sent from Mr Packham's own Twitter account on the eve of a government action to shoot badgers . 'We did also consider some of the language used in the tweets to be intemperate and we have spoken to Chris about both these issues.' He added: 'Chris' Twitter account was not managed or supported by the BBC and although it identifies Chris as a BBC presenter, this does not imply BBC endorsement of the views aired on the account.' Meanwhile Mr Packham is urging everyone with a large garden to install a kestrel nesting box to halt the sharp decline of the falcon in the UK. Badgers were culled in some areas at the end of August to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis . Kestrel numbers have dropped by 30 percent since 1970 to about 30,000 breeding pairs. Mr Packham, president of the Hawk Conservancy Trust, says the decline is partly because of a loss of the birds' nesting places. Kestrel boxes are available from wildlife organisations and can be made from tea chests. 'They should face open space' said Mr Packham. 'Kestrels like looking out in an open environment on the edge of a wood or overlooking fields.'","Presenter found to have breached voluntary code of conduct .

"Britons consume less sugar and fat than they did 30 years ago . The nation is getting fatter despite the healthy eating message sinking in, a study has revealed. Researchers found that an average . person eats 600 fewer calories each day than 30 years ago – a 20 per . cent drop – but weighs 30lb more. While snacks, sweets and takeaways . have been ditched in favour of healthier options, the main cause of . obesity is likely to be a decline in physical activity, it is claimed. The 20 per cent drop in daily calorie intake is the equivalent of a burger and chips from a fast food restaurant or three pints of Guinness. But the weight gain cannot be fully explained by lazy Brits adopting a couch potato lifestyle, said the five-year study by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. Instead, it shows that as Britons get older they find it harder to keep their weight down. This suggests adults become more susceptible as they get older to the effects of some sugars and fats in modern food, says the report. The full study is to be published later this summer but details which have emerged show that the average adult Briton has cut down calories intake by around 600 calories a day. This is almost entirely down to better food and drink habits in the home because the amount of calories consumed outside the home is up by 15 per cent over the same period. At home, though, Britons today are having cereal for breakfast rather than fried food, using semi-skimmed milk, and eating more fish and less red meat. They are also drinking less alcohol. The average Briton today may eat less than people did 30 years ago but they exercise less and have a more sedentary job .

Added . to this, an adult today is more likely to have a desk job during the . day and more likely to spend time in front of a screen when home in the . evening. The average . adult is putting on weight at an average of 0.25kg - just over half a . pound - a year, said report author Professor Rachel Griffiths of the . IFS. But it means that a man in his twenties weighs around 7kg - 15lbs - more today than a man in his twenties did three decades ago. And someone in their 50s weighs a staggering 14kg - 30lbs - more today than someone of the same age 30 years ago. Professor Griffiths told industry journal The Grocer: ‘The drop in calories consumed would have been expected to have caused a weight loss of 1kg per year over the period.’ She said the link between the rise in obesity and the increased sugar in some foods could be behind the disparity in the figures. She added: ‘We are looking at why certain age groups and people seem to be far more susceptible to weight gain.’","Britons now have less fat, sugar and alcohol in their diets but have more sedentary jobs and exercise less .

"Having an orgasm that lasts for three hours might sound like fun to many but for Liz, from Seattle, the experience was anything but. Instead, she says it was fun 'for the first five minutes' but soon descended into a nightmarish experience that left her needing hospital treatment. Worse, the marathon orgasm proved to be the first of a series of unwanted sexual spasms that could strike anywhere and at any time. Scroll down for video . Awkward: Seattle native Liz developed a rare condition which left her orgasmic up to 12 times a day . 'Initially it was just after sex but . eventually, it got to the point where I could be doing anything from . watching TV, walking down the street and I would have an orgasm out of . the blue,' explains Liz. 'I . could sometimes hold it off for a short time by holding my breath and I . would get out of public situations as quickly as possible. I didn't run . my life - my body ran my life for me. 'It . was very depressing. It got to the point where I would have as many as . 12 spontaneous prolonged orgasms in one day. I was going from specialist . to specialist to specialist and they didn't know what to do with me. It . was a very hard time in my life.' Her problems began after she suffered an unexpectedly lengthy orgasm that continued for so long, it left her in hospital. Embarrassing: Liz (pictured with boyfriend Eric) says her orgasms could strike any time and anywhere . 'The first five or so minutes were pleasurable,' remembers Liz. 'Most people who haven't been through something like this think a half hour long orgasm, an hour-long orgasm, would be an awesome experience. Until you actually experience something like this, that is.' When the orgasm failed to stop, Liz, panicking, began ringing every doctor she'd ever been to in the hopes of finding a way of stopping the unwanted sensation. With the help of boyfriend Eric, she tried hopping on the spot, drinking a glass of wine and even took antihistamines in an effort to stop it. Realising that it wasn't about to stop, Eric insisted on taking Liz to A&E where doctors were left baffled by the continuing orgasm. 'Having to walk while having an orgasm is like walking in jello,' adds Liz. 'It's a difficult thing to do. I remember having to put mind over matter to make it work. Telling their story: Liz and boyfriend Eric told their tale on TLC show, Sex Sent Me to the ER (tonight) Solution: Liz will have to take bipolar medication for the rest of her life to keep the orgasms at bay . 'The doctors kept asking me, ""Are you sure your partner didn't drug you or something like that?"" And I was thinking, ""Why on Earth would Eric drug me?"",' she adds. Eventually, the orgasm stopped - without the help of medics who had been unable to establish the cause. 'At first, it was just sheer disbelief,' adds Liz of the moment the orgasm finally ended. 'I thought it was going to start right back up but it didn't. 'It's a physically, emotionally and mentally taxing experience to have an orgasm for three hours.' But although the marathon orgasm had ended, her problems hadn't as she endured near-continuous orgasms, sometimes having as many as 12 a day. Doctors, initially baffled, eventually pinpointed the cause of the problem - bipolar disorder which had been misdiagnosed as depression and treated with anti-depressants. 'Anti-depressants exacerbate multi-orgasmic dysfunction because they actually change brain chemistry, that's their job,' comments Dr Irwin Goldstein, director of the Institute of Sexual Medicine in the USA. To tackle both the bipolar disorder and persistent orgasms, Liz was given valproic acid - a substance that treats bipolar while at the same time suppressing the brain chemicals used during orgasm. 'I got . down from where I was to having them only daily, then to one every . other day, then I was having them weekly and then maybe it was about . once a month,' says Liz. 'It took about four to five months before they were . completely under control and it's probably been about a year since I've had . one. She adds: 'My diagnosis is that I . probably have to take meds every day for the rest of my life and I . don't live in fear. I have a very happy sex life and I don't have to . live in fear.' Liz appears on Sex sent me to the ER, starting 20th March on TLC .","Liz from Seattle suffered a three-hour orgasm that left her in hospital .

"Officials are concerned that the black market for marijuana in Colorado is undiminished following a series of violent incidents during illegal transactions of the drug. As the country's first state to legalize marijuana, Colorado is being closely observed to determine the effect of legalization on marijuana-related crime. Under Colorado law, it is legal to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, but authorities fear the measures could embolden illegal dealers and buyers, who believe they can escape prosecution. Drug-related death: This photo provided by Lafayette Colorado Police Dept shows Nathaniel Tallman, 25, who was shot dead trying to sell marijuana the old-fashioned, illegal way . While no one expected the state's . first-in-the-nation recreational sales would eliminate the need for . dangerous underground sales overnight, the violence has raised concerns . among police, prosecutors and pot advocates that a black market for . marijuana is alive and well in Colorado. A 25-year-old is shot dead trying to sell . marijuana the old-fashioned, illegal way. Two men from Texas set up a . warehouse to grow more than they would ever need. And three people . buying pot in a grocery store parking lot are robbed at gunpoint. 'It . has done nothing more than enhance the opportunity for the black . market,' said Lieutenant Mark Comte of the Colorado Springs police vice and . narcotics unit. 'If you can get it tax-free on the corner, you're going . to get it on the corner.' Marijuana crime: Daniel Ortiz, along with Russell Britton and Moises Mendez was charged with felony first-degree murder, robbery and aggravated motor-vehicle theft in the death of 25-year-old Nathaniel Tallman . It's difficult to measure whether there . has been an increase in pot-related crimes beyond anecdotal reports . because no one at either the federal or state levels is keeping track of . the numbers of killings, robberies and other crimes linked directly to . marijuana. Pot advocates say . the state is in a transition period, and while pot-related crimes will . continue, they will begin to decline as more stores open and prices of . legal marijuana decline. 'It's . just a transition period,' activist Brian Vicente said. 'Marijuana was . illegal for the last 80 years in our state, and there are some remnants . of that still around. Certainly, much like alcohol, over time these . underground dealers will fade away.' Sales are due to begin in June in Washington, where authorities will be watching for similar cases. 'There's . going to be a black market here,' said Commander Pat Slack of the Snohomish . Regional Drug/Gang Task Force, which covers an area outside Seattle. 'There will be drug rip-offs and drug debts that haven't been paid. All . of that is going to stay.' Suspect: Tallman was allegedly on his way to meet Russell Britton (pictured) to 'conduct a marijuana transaction' at 7 pm January 21. His body was discovered two months later . Under . Colorado's voter-approved law, it is legal to possess up to an ounce of . marijuana. Authorities are concerned that means illegal dealers and . buyers believe they can avoid prosecution. These dealers and their . customers also tend to be targets, if robbers know they are flush with . cash. Arapahoe County, . outside Denver, has seen 'a growing number of drug rips and outright . burglaries and robberies of people who have large amounts of marijuana . or cash on them,' said District Attorney George Brauchler. His . district has seen at least three homicides linked to pot in recent . months and a rising number of robberies and home invasions. Among . them was a February case in which a 17-year-old boy said he . accidentally shot and killed his girlfriend while robbing a man who had . come to purchase weed. Elsewhere, . prosecutors say, Nathaniel Tallman, 25, was killed during a January . drug deal when he was robbed and shot, and his body dumped in Wyoming. The next month, a dealer mugged three people who were trying to buy marijuana from him in a Denver grocery store parking lot. Such . deals are the exception, said Vicente. The 'average customer' prefers . to buy in a well-lit, regulated store, he said, citing the roughly $2 . million Colorado made in marijuana taxes in January alone. Whether dangerous or not, it can still be cheaper to buy pot from a drug dealer. Voters . who approved recreational sales in Colorado also agreed to a 12.9 . per cent state sales tax and a 15 per cent excise tax on it. Local . jurisdictions can also add their own taxes. Medical marijuana is taxed, . too, but at a much lower rate - a 2.9 per cent sales tax. Those . taxes mean an ounce of pot can go for $400 or more at a . state-sanctioned store, depending on quality and potency. An ounce on . the street can run between $200 and $280, depending on how much a dealer . wants to profit, Comte said. Underground dealers also are not burdened by complex regulations and licenses. 'Those . barriers to entry already create the potential for the black market, . and then you add these taxes on top of it, and it makes it impossible to . get rid of,' said Denver attorney Robert Corry, who helped write the . pot legalization measure but opposed the taxes. Corry, who has long represented marijuana dealers facing criminal charges, said his clientele has hardly diminished. Comte's . unit recently searched a warehouse where two men from Texas were . growing 'so much more than they could ever need,' he said. Detectives . charged them with possession of pot with intent to distribute. Drug deal gone bad: Moise Mendez, along with Russell Britton and Daniel Ortiz  are charged with felony first-degree murder, robbery and aggravated motor-vehicle theft in the death of 25-year-old Nathaniel Tallman . If . some Colorado drug dealers have lost business to legal retailers, some . also have made up for it by transporting weed to other states. A . Lakewood man was arrested in March after postal inspectors intercepted a . package he was mailing containing a pound of pot. Drug task force . officers who later searched his home found scores of gallon-sized bags . of marijuana and 76 plants. Marijuana . cases can be hard to prosecute and are not cost-effective, so police . often prefer to focus attention on drugs like heroin and . methamphetamine, Comte said. One . result, he said, is the feeling among illegal dealers that because . retail sales are legal, authorities are looking the other way. Mark . Kleiman, a public policy professor at the University of California, Los . Angeles, who is helping Washington set up its legal marijuana industry, . said the black market's survival has less to do with taxes than with a . shortage of legal stores. Colorado has more than 160 state-licensed stores, but they remain concentrated in the Denver area. Many towns don't have any. 'When . there are more stores and more products in the stores and prices settle . down, then we'll see,' Kleiman said. 'I would be very surprised if the . illicit market can compete at all.'","There have been a series of violent crimes related to the illegal sale of marijuana in Colorado this year .

"A schoolboy who was almost killed when knocked out by a massive electric shock now claims the accident gave him superpowers like those of X-Men's Magneto. Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, had been walking home after school when he lent briefly against a lamp post that was live from a faulty wire, and was blasted across the pavement. He said: 'When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. Scroll down for video . Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, claims metal objects stick to him like they do to X-Men character Magneto . Nikolai pictured with a load of cutlery and coins sticking to his back. He claims he woke up with the 'superpower' after he suffered an electric shock . Stories about living magnets such as Nikolai (pictured) began to appear in the middle of the 19th century . The schoolboy claims to have powers similar to Magneto, from X-Men. Pictured is Sir Ian McKellan, who played the character Magneto in the movie X-Men: The Last Stand . 'When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.' He said he is a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test. He said: 'I can do things I couldn't do before, but I don't have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me.' Nikolai added that he has now decided he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people. He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers. Stories about 'living magnets' began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century. Nikolai pictured with his classmates, who he says constantly ask him to show off his new 'superpower' Factory worker Leonid Tenkaev pictured in 2004. He claimed to have obtained the ability to attract metal objects following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster . In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as 'magnets', many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body. Only some of them develop a 'preference' for a particular material. In 1990, as many as 300 'living magnets' gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV. The woman could hold 7kg of metal on a vertical palm. Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic, it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin.","Russian schoolboy claims to have powers like X-Men's Magneto .

"Swift justice: Nicolas Sarkozy instantly expelled two radical Islamists from France . Two radical Islamists were kicked out of France yesterday – prompting calls for Theresa May to take the same no-nonsense approach when it comes to removing extremists. Nicolas Sarkozy demanded the deportation of a convicted  terrorist and a hate preacher. No sooner had the expulsion order been signed than the pair were put on flights out of the country. The swift departures led to . comparisons with Britain’s embarrassingly flawed efforts to remove hate . preacher Abu Qatada who is wanted in Jordan on terror charges. He is out on bail after the European . Court of Human Rights blocked his deportation on the grounds that Qatada . would not face a fair trial if returned. Home Secretary Mrs May has insisted . she wants to secure an agreement with Jordan which would satisfy the . Strasbourg court and allow Qatada to be removed from Britain. Despite . this however, officials insist any attempt to remove him in breach of . the court’s ruling would be met with a court injunction by his lawyers. French law allows swift removal of . foreigners, with around 20,000 non-EU nationals being expelled every . year. Unlike in Britain, where cases can drag on for years, rights of . appeal are strictly curtailed. In this country, ministers wait until . a subject’s legal options are  exhausted before removing them from the . country. This can include a lengthy appeal to the European Court of . Human Rights. But in France, Italy and other . European countries, terror suspects have been removed even if legal . proceedings are still going on, or even in breach of a Strasbourg . ruling. French security forces arrest Mohamed Achamlane, the leader of the Forsane Alizza Islamic radical group, after searching his house in Bouguenais, western France last week . Terrorist: The crackdown in France was prompted by the killings of seven people, including three children, by Al-Qaeda inspired gunman Mohamed Merah (pictured) last month . Mr Sarkozy, who is behind in the polls . going into this month’s  Presidential election, said: ‘Those who make . remarks contrary to the values of the Republic will be put outside the . French Republic. There will be no exceptions.’ Almany Baradji, an imam, was sent back . to Mali for ‘preaching anti-Semitism’ and calling on women to wear the . full veil, which is illegal in France. Ali Belhadad, an Algerian convicted . for his role in a 1994 terror attack in Marrakesh that killed 14 people, . was flown to Algiers after the authorities discovered he had resumed . contact with Islamic activists. Another man, Saad Nasser Alshastry, a . Saudi imam, was barred from returning to France. Last night Tory MP for Shipley Philip Davies said: ‘It would be nice if we adopted the same approach in this country. ‘I’m sure this isn’t disconnected to . the forthcoming presidential elections in France. This is what irritates . the public about politicians – they take these actions before the . election and once voting ends, normal service resumes. ‘I think the British public want to see these people deported.’ Comparisons: The untouchable Abu Qatada (left), who is wanted on Jordan on terror charges, and Almany Baradji (right), who was sent back to Mali . The row comes ahead of a key ruling by the Strasbourg court over the extradition of hook-handed extremist Abu Hamza. He is wanted for terror offences in . the U.S. but has argued that sending him for trial would breach his . human rights. A decision on his case and that of five other terror . suspects will be delivered next Tuesday. Douglas Carswell, MP for . Clacton, added: ‘The fact seems to be that we can throw out Abu Qatada . and others like him if we want to. It’s just a question of will in . Whitehall.’ On Monday a senior judge expressed his . astonishment that an Algerian terrorist who was thrown out of France is . now living in Britain. The 49-year-old was convicted of a . 1992 airport bomb attack in his country. He lived in France where he was . jailed for membership of a terrorist group and ordered to be deported. In 2001 he came to Britain and since then has been fighting to claim asylum in the UK. The Court of Appeal ruled in his favour. The crackdown in France follows the . killings of seven people last month by Al Qaeda-inspired gunman Mohamed . Merah. The victims included three Jewish schoolchildren.","Two radical Islamists have already been put on flights out of France within hours of Sarkozy's expulsion order .

"Google has been accused of racism after allegedly linking names usually associated with black people to adverts related to criminality. A Harvard University professor found 'significant discrimination' after comparing the adverts which appear when searching a typically black name compared with those for typically white names. Findings showed that names typically associated with black people were 25 per cent more likely to bring up adverts related to criminality. Racist? A new study claims that adverts linked to Google search results for typically black American names are more likely to be suggestive of criminality - like services offering to check arrest and criminal records . The study by Latanya Sweeney contrasted online searches using names such as 'Ebony' and 'DeShawn,' with those such as 'Jill' and 'Geoffrey.' She found that adverts posted alongside search results for names likely to belong to black people were more likely to offer services like background checks for arrests and criminal records. Searches using white-sounding names were less likely to result in advert results which suggested criminality, Professor Sweeney's research indicated. The findings are significant since Google searching the names of potential employees, clients or even friends and dates has become commonplace. 'Advantages of knowing such information when hiring or engaging with a person relate to trustworthiness,' Professor Sweeney writes in a paper published online in the journal arXiv. Consequences: The findings are significant since Google searching the names of potential employees, clients or even friends and dates has become commonplace (file photo) Professor Sweeney gathered evidence by collecting more than 2,000 names which were suggestive of race. She then entered these names plus . surnames into Google and news agency Reuters' Google-powered search . engine and looked at which adverts the search results returned. While most names brought back adverts . for public records, typically black names were much more likely to . bring back those that included the word 'arrest'. All the results came from background-checking service instantcheckmate.com. In one particular case highlighted by . Professor Sweeney, a search for the black-sounding names Latanya . Farrell, Latanya Sweeney and Latanya Lockett all brought up adverts for . arrest checking services. However, subsequent investigation showed only one of the names, Latanya Lockett, had an arrest record linked to it. Sample ad and criminal reports for 'latanya farrell' (a,b), 'latanya sweeney' (c,d), and 'latanya locket' (e,f)appearing on google.com and reuters.com . Typically white names: Sample ads and criminal reports for 'kristen haring' (a), 'kristen sparrow' (b), and 'kristen lindquist' (c). Criminal reports from instantcheckmate.com (b,d,f) Brain scans could soon be used to detect whether or not people are racist, scientists say. Researchers found that brain scans were able to pick up on differences in the way that people with implicit negative racial attitudes viewed black and white faces. Racial stereotypes have previously been shown to have subtle and unintended consequences on how we treat members of different race groups. But the new research published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, shows race biases also increase differences in the brain's representations of faces. Psychologists from the University of Geneva in Switzerland and New York University examined activity in the brain while participants looked at pictures of White and black faces. Afterwards, participants performed a task that assessed their unconscious or implicit expression of race attitudes. By examining patterns of brain activity in the fusiform face area — which is involved in face perception — researchers were able to predict the race of the person the participant was viewing, but only for those with strong, negative implicit race attitudes. This, the researchers said, implies that people with stronger, negative implicit race attitudes may actually perceive black and white faces to look more different than others who held no such prejudice. 'In comparison, searches for “Kristen Haring”, “Kristen Sparrow” and “Kristen Lindquist” did not yield any instantcheckmate.com ads, only competitor ads, even though the company’s database reports having records for all three names and arrest records for “Kristen Sparrow” and “Kristen Lindquist"",' Professor Sweeney wrote. She added: 'Together, these hand-picked examples describe the suspected pattern – ads suggesting arrest tend to appear with names associated with blacks and neutral ads or no ads tend to appear with names associated with whites, regardless of whether the company has an arrest record associated with the name.' In the UK, black people are 3.3 times more likely than white people to be arrested for a crime and those from the mixed ethnic group 2.3 times more likely. The findings raise 'questions as to whether Google's advertising technology exposes racial bias in society and how ad and search technology can develop to assure racial fairness,' Professor Sweeney said in a blog post. Advertisers bid on terms, or key words, with high bidders getting their ads posted alongside corresponding search results. Google defends the process as race-neutral, saying outcomes are driven by decisions by advertisers. A spokesman said: 'AdWords does not conduct any racial profiling. 'We also have an “anti” and violence policy which states that we will not allow ads that advocate against an organisation, person or group of people. 'It is up to individual advertisers to decide which keywords they want to choose to trigger their ads.' Instant Checkmate contacted MailOnline in response the the issues raised in the study. A spokesman said: 'As a point of fact, Instant Checkmate would like to state unequivocally that it has never engaged in racial profiling in Google AdWords. 'We have absolutely no technology in place to even connect a name with a race and have never made any attempt to do so. 'The very idea is contrary to our company's most deeply held principles and values.' The study was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and a grant from Google.","Professor finds 'significant discrimination' in ad results, with black names 25 per cent more likely to be linked to arrest record check services .

"Breaking ranks: Labour's Gloria de Piero has condemned remarks made by a fellow MP about lynching a Tory minister . A senior Labour frontbencher has broken ranks to condemn remarks made by a fellow MP about lynching a Tory minister. Women and equalities spokesman Gloria De Piero rounded on John McDonnell, calling his comments about Employment Minister Esther McVey at an anti-war comedy night on Remembrance Sunday ‘clearly unacceptable’. Her criticism contrasted with Labour’s weaker response, which stopped short of admonishing the Left-wing MP. A Labour spokesman said his views ‘don’t represent the views of the party’, adding: ‘He speaks for himself.’ Mr McDonnell refused to apologise or withdraw his comments, and turned his fire on the Daily Mail for reporting them. He called the article revealing what he said ‘a badge of honour’. He also claimed he had simply reported what was said about Miss McVey at a public meeting in her Liverpool constituency. But Miss De Piero said: ‘It may have been that John was quoting one of Esther McVey’s constituents, but when this constituent is calling for a female minister to be lynched, that is clearly unacceptable.’ Yesterday, The Mail revealed details of the comedy night, held in Covent Garden, which featured mocking of the ceramic poppies at the Tower of London and jokes about killing the Royal Family. But it was Mr McDonnell’s remarks that horrified many. He spoke about visiting Liverpool, where Miss McVey faces a campaign to oust her. To applause, he said: ‘I spoke at a packed public meeting... a group in the audience completely kicked off quite critical of the whole concept because they were arguing, “Why are we sacking her? Why aren’t we lynching the b******?”’ Female Tory MPs condemned his remarks. Education Secretary and Women and Equalities minister Nicky Morgan said they were ‘outrageous’, and asked why other women Labour MPs had failed to criticise the remarks, tweeting: ‘Is it OK when [it is] one of their MPs?’ Scroll down for video . Tory Sports Minister Helen Grant tweeted that ‘threats of violence and abuse’ were ‘never a laughing matter’, adding: ‘Disgusted by “joke” made by John McDonnell.’ Backbencher MP Harriett Baldwin called on Ed Miliband to withdraw the whip from the Labour MP for his ‘vile comments about violence against women’, adding: ‘What does feminist Harriet Harman say?’ Gloria De Piero rounded on John McDonnell (left), calling his comments about Employment Minister Esther McVey (right) at an anti-war comedy night on Remembrance Sunday ‘clearly unacceptable’ Labour deputy leader Miss Harman, a campaigner on the issue of violence against women, did not comment. Among those at the event were former shadow minister Diane Abbott and Left-wing MP Jeremy Corbyn. Miss Abbott also made no comment. Last night, Tory chairman Grant Shapps wrote to Ed Miliband calling on him to withdraw the whip, in effect suspending Mr McDonnell from the Labour Party. He wrote: ‘This is a sickening demand – in public – for a violent attack on a female Member of Parliament. John McDonnell should apologise.’ But Mr McDonnell replied: ‘If you had bothered to check your facts, you will have known I was reporting what had been said at a meeting in Ms McVey’s constituency by her own constituents, nothing more.’","Labour MP John McDonnell made the comment about Tory Esther McVey .

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been depicted as a concentration camp victim on the cover of a respected Polish magazine. Dressed in striped pyjamas and a head covering, Merkel is seen behind barbed wire in Uwazam Rze. The image has intensified a diplomatic war of words between Germany and Poland over wartime guilt. Chancellor Angela Merkel has been portrayed as a concentration camp victim in the controversial magazine cover . The magazine ran the picture of Mrs Merkel alongside the headline: 'Falsification of History: How The Germans Made Themselves The Victims of World War II.' The image has been branded tasteless in Germany. Poland has accused its neighbour of distorting historical facts and making victims of the war out of the real criminals. The reason for the allegations is the German TV station ZDF three-part documentary which aired at the end of March 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers'. It focussed on the fate of five Germans in WWII and upset people in Poland after it depicted Polish resistance fighters as anti-Semitic. In one scene a group of fighters orders a train with concentration camp victims to carry on when they realise the passengers are Jewish. In another a partisan says 'we drown Jews like rats.' The Polish ambassador to Berlin was furious at the depiction of Poles as hostile towards Jews in the programme . Some Poles have accused Germany of trying to change historical facts in the way the war was portrayed . The Polish diplomat in Germany Jerzy Marganski wrote a letter to the TV station after the 14million euro series aired to express his disgust. He wrote: 'The image of Poland and the Polish resistance against the German occupiers as conveyed by this series is perceived by most Poles as extremely unjust and offensive.' Among other criticisms, Marganski said viewers learn nothing of the Warsaw uprising, in which up to 200,000 Polish civilians died, nor of the many Poles who helped Jews. He said the programme gave the impression that more people 'were to blame for the destruction of Jews' than just the Germans. ZDF responded saying . that in no way was it intending to trivialise historical facts or . reduce German responsibility with the mini series. Producer Nico Hofmann said the depictions of 'the Polish situation... are based on historically vetted material' and there was no intention to defame the Poles.' He said the goal was encourage a national debate about the experiences of war.","Uwazam Rze showed the Chancellor in striped pyjamas and a head scarf .

"Nowhere outside of Anfield has a fonder place in the hearts of Liverpool fans than Istanbul and its Ataturk Olympic Stadium. It was here, of course, that Rafael Benitez and his players completed arguably the greatest Champions League triumph of them all, coming back from three goals down at half-time against AC Milan to be crowned European champions for a fifth time in 2005. The legend of that night lives on; Benitez’s inspirational reshuffle at the interval, sending on Didi Hamann to help turn the game, Steven Gerrard dragging his beleaguered team up off the floor, and Jerzy Dudek’s penalty save from Andriy Shevchenko in the shootout that crowned an epic comeback. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sportsmail's preview of Besitkas vs Liverpool . Liverpool players trained on Wednesday ahead of their Europa League round of 32 tie at Besiktas . Jerzy Dudek proved Liverpool's hero as they won the 2005 Champions League at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium . Liverpool's players run towards Dudek in celebration after their penalty victory over AC Milan in the final . Nearly a decade later, at the premiere of the movie One Night in Istanbul last September, Gerrard could still hardly believe what happened. ‘It goes to show how big the night was, there’s still a buzz about it today,’ said the Liverpool skipper. ‘Every day I have conversations about it, in and around the city I still get asked about it and get thanked for my individual performance. ‘It will be in my memories until the day I go, that’s because I love Liverpool just as much as the fans. The feeling when Jerzy saved the last pen, I still get goosebumps now. It was a surreal feeling.’ Gerrard is the only current Liverpool player left from that night. Sadly, he will be absent when they return to the Ataturk on Thursday night to face Besiktas, a hamstring problem meaning that he has been left at home on Merseyside to try and get fit for Sunday’s clash with Manchester City. The occasion is bound to stir the emotions of Liverpool fans, even those who weren’t lucky enough to be there in 2005, and manager Brendan Rodgers was quick to acknowledge the significance of the venue when Liverpool touched down here on Wednesday. ‘Of course it was a great historic night for the club and everyone associated with Liverpool respects that,’ he said. ‘It was a little while ago and there won’t be too many of our players that were involved at that time, but it’s a real iconic stadium for the club and a big part of that history.’ Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard  is the only current Liverpool player left from that historic night in 2005 . However, the 34-year-old (left) will miss Thursday's tie after picking up a hamstring injury against Tottenham . Rodgers knows that this will be an altogether different occasion, however. For starters, the prize at stake is a somewhat more modest – a place in the last 16 of the Europa League, Liverpool having won the first leg 1-0 at Anfield last week. They arrived in Istanbul without eight senior players including Gerrard, some injured and some rested as Rodgers tries to balance his options in the knowledge that Liverpool will not land back home until 3am on Friday morning with little recovery time before they face the champions. ‘We will have very little preparation time,’ he added. ‘But look, it’s the way it’s been dealt and we’ll deal with it the best we can. The players have had lots of challenges to overcome this season and we are ready to keep doing the best we can. But it’s still a European competition, and I would rather be in it than not in it.’ Even without so many regulars, Rodgers should still be able to field a strong enough side and has already confirmed that Daniel Sturridge will start in attack. The main area of concern is central midfield, with Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Lucas all absent through injury, but Emre Can could be moved further forward after impressing in a three-man defence since Christmas. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will be hoping his side can use that spirit to see them through on Thursday . Mario Balotelli scored a late penalty to give the Reds a slender 1-0 first leg advantage over Besiktas last week . The 24-year-old (right) will be hoping to be involved in the action when the two sides meet on Thursday . Liverpool’s 8-0 victory over Besiktas at Anfield in November 2007 remains the Turkish club’s heaviest European defeat, and the biggest in the Champions League beyond the qualifying stages, but more recent history suggests that this will be no easy task for Rodgers’s team who have failed to win any of their last four away games in Europe. Besiktas, who are playing at the Ataturk while their Vodafone Arena is being renovated, beat Tottenham 1-0 here in the Europa League group stage in December having already held Arsenal to a goalless draw in Champions League qualifying last August. ‘We respect our opponent,’ said Rodgers. ‘We haven’t arrived in Turkey being arrogant enough to think it will be comfortable. We understand it will be a difficult game, but we still have a squad strong enough to hopefully get the job complete.’ And we know better than to doubt Liverpool at the Ataturk.","Liverpool travel to Turkey to face Besiktas in Thursday's Europa League tie .

"Fired: Rachel Brothers has been awarded compensation after being let go from her job with the Black Educators Association in Canada in 2006 . A biracial woman has won an $10,200 payout after she was fired from her job at the Black Educators Association (BEA) in Nova Scotia, Canada because she 'wasn't black enough'. Rachel Brothers, was awarded the sum last week after Donald Murray, the Chairman of the Board of Inquiry at the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, ruled that she was discriminated against because of the color of her skin. According to a report published by the board, Brothers was singled out by a subordinate at the association, Catherine Collier, who undermined her because 'she was younger than, and not as black, as Ms Collier thought Ms, Brothers should be.' Evidence was given to the board that claimed Collier told Brothers her biracial skin color was a 'barrier' to black people and that she was 'too light skinned to 'officially represent them because she wasn't black enough'. Another staff member at the BEA told Brothers she 'should go work for whitey'. Murray claimed that Brothers was fired from her job in 2006, after less than a year as a regional educator at the association’s Annapolis Valley regional office in Kentville, because her decisions were viewed through the BEA's 'colorist thinking' and behavior. According to the Chronicle Herald, colorist thinking occurs to 'someone who believes the closer a person’s skin tone comes to pure white, the better the chances of getting jobs, accommodations and other opportunities available to “actual ‘white’ people.' Indeed, colorists also think the 'more visibly black, East Indian, American Indian or Asian a person is, 'the greater the potential there will be for discriminatory distinctions to be made based on ‘color,' Murray wrote. Ruling: This is the headquarters of the Black Educators Association in Halifax, Nova Scotia - at which Rachel Brothers suffered discrimination . According to Murray's report, Collier, who had applied for the same job as Brothers, would make comments that made Brothers job untenable at the BEA. Murray said that Brothers was fired from her job because of work decisions the BEA made in which skin color was paramount and 'the problems that her skin color had created in her office for another employee.' The board also ruled that acting executive director of the BEA was aware of 'colorist and ageist comments being made' and did nothing to stop them. Despite being dismissed in 2006, it wasn't until 2008 that Brothers filed her complaint and it has taken six years for it to be heard. Murray claimed in evidence Collier obviously still hated Brothers and displayed 'a continuing, petty vindictiveness towards Ms. Brothers' that 'was, frankly, appalling.' Indeed, while executives from the BEA said Brothers was fired for financial irregularities, Murray found no evidence. He believes she was fired because Collier, who took Brothers job, was better placed to work with the BEA's head office. The Black Educators Association was founded in 1969 to help African Nova Scotian communities.",Rachel Brothers fired in 2006 was awarded compensation eight years later .
"Among the many tattoos on Danny Ings’s body is an inscription on the inside of his left forearm. It reads: ‘The difference between the impossible and possible lies in the man’s determination’. It’s a quality the Burnley striker has drawn on more than any other to propel himself into the Premier League and, now it seems, to the brink of a move to Liverpool. Just four years ago, Ings was playing for Dorchester Town in the Conference South on loan from Bournemouth. Even when he made a £1million move to Turf Moor from the South Coast in 2011, you could hardly say he was a star in the making. Danny Ings has a tattoo with an inspirational inscription inked on to his left forearm . Ings has netted seven times in the Premier League for Sean Dyche's Clarets this season . But Ings has been battling the odds ever since he was rejected by Southampton’s academy at the age of 10. At 15, when most Premier League hopefuls are well on their way through the system, he was playing for was his dad’s team Itchen Tyro in the Hampshire Sunday League. Ings stuck at it, though, through dedication and sheer hard work. He has flourished at Burnley under Sean Dyche, scoring 26 goals in the club’s promotion campaign last season, and seven in the top-flight since returning from a hamstring injury in October. Even that is not enough for the England Under-21 striker who has caught the attention of Roy Hodgson and now Brendan Rodgers. ‘Four years ago I was playing for Dorchester Town so it’s a dream come true for me,’ Ings told Sportsmail recently. ‘But it’s also a journey I don’t want to settle with. I want to carry on that journey and I want to improve to become the best I can be. ‘You always dream and have hopes but I think it all comes down to hard work. I have always grown being hard working. I have never known where I will end but all I could do was give myself the best opportunity by working as hard as I can.’ Ings is wanted by Liverpool as Brendan Rodgers looks to strengthen his attacking options . Dyche has nurtured Ings into one of the hottest prospects in English football over the last two years . Ings has recently set up a disability project in east Lancashire and enjoys a healthy relationship with the fans . It will be a wrench for Ings to leave Turf Moor, however. He has a great relationship with the fans and recently set up the Danny Ings Disability Project which aims to bring football coaching to disabled youngsters and those with learning difficulties. It will continue, he insists, even if he leaves the club. The 22-year-old has also stayed on good terms with the club even though, privately, it has been acknowledged for some time that he will not be signing a new contract when his four-year deal ran out in the summer. Dyche even went to the lengths of publicly praising the player’s agent recently which is rare in these situations. Ings' contribution to their Premier League survival fight is worth considerably more to them than the transfer fee. If he leaves, they will be losing a good man. And Liverpool will get a striker who is determined to succeed.","Burnley striker Danny Ings is a target for Liverpool .

"Jordan Henderson feels Liverpool are more than a match for any team in the Barclays Premier League after they continued their excellent recent run with a 3-2 win over Tottenham. The Reds are now firmly in the hunt for a top-four place after extending their unbeaten streak in the league to nine matches. They now lie just three points behind fourth-placed Arsenal and Henderson believes they are capable of beating anyone put in front of them. Mario Balotelli scores the winning goal against Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris at Anfield . The Liverpool players crowd around Serbian midfielder Lazar Markovic following his goal against Spurs . 'We always feel we can beat anyone if we keep playing the way we have been,' he said on BT Sport 1.

Balotelli is hounded by his Liverpool teammates following his late goal against Tottenham . Lazar Markovic's opener was cancelled out by the in-form Harry Kane, while Spurs levelled again, after Steven Gerrard had put Liverpool back in front from the penalty spot, through Mousa Dembele. But forgotten man Mario Balotelli swooped to stab home seven minutes from time for his first league goal since his £16million move from AC Milan last summer. It was a muted celebration from the Italian, although Henderson thinks his team-mate will be delighted with his contribution. 'I'm sure he'll be smiling in the dressing room. When he came on, he worked hard and got the goal and the three points for the team,' he added. Tottenham Hotspur defender Walker takes on Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge at Anfield . 'When he came on, he worked hard and got the goal and the three points for the team. Hopefully we can kick on now. 'We've got momentum, we've been playing some great stuff.

Speaking in the absence of manager Brendan Rodgers, who had to catch a flight, assistant boss Colin Pascoe paid tribute to the Italian, who has struggled to settle back in English football since joining Liverpool for £16million last summer. Mousa Dembele scores for Tottenham but Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet is quick to appeal . Dembele celebrates his goal against Liverpool by pointing up at the skies in celebration . 'He is immensely happy,' said Pascoe. 'To get a winner at Anfield, I am sure he is happy. 'It was great movement from Mario in the six-yard box. I hope it can be a springboard, he is training hard. The last couple of weeks he's been ill and had gashes on his feet so couldn't get his boots on. 'It was important for us tonight to win the game, Tottenham have been on a great run. It was two good teams but the way we came through was fantastic. 'We knew it would be a tough game. It was very important we got the three points to close the gap. Our next game is Southampton and we will look at that to get three points and close the gap. 'It was that kind of game, a great spectacle. We knew we would always create chances. Daniel Sturridge is always a threat in behind. It was great for young Jordon Ibe, he played very well. He slipped that ball into Adam Lallana, who played it in to Mario to get a winner.' Steven Gerrard leaps in the air to celebrate his penalty at Anfield on Tuesday night . One concern for Liverpool was that captain Steven Gerrard went off with a hamstring problem. Pascoe added: 'It is a precaution. He looked over and said he could feel it a little.' Tottenham's in-form striker Harry Kane scored his 23rd goal of the season to remain the top marksman in the Premier League. It was the first League goal Liverpool had conceded for 416 minutes. Brendan Rodgers shakes hands with Sturridge as the England striker is replaced at Anfield . Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino claimed a draw would have been a fair result. The Argentine said: 'We are disappointed with the result because I think one point would have been fair for both teams. It was a great game, we played well but this is football. The players are very disappointed, sad and tired but we have to accept football is like this. 'I am proud of the effort and we have to look forward.

"A property developer has released incredible before and after images that show how the bustling railroad tracks leading into New York's world famous Penn Station have had a 2.6 acre concrete platform built above them to create space for a massive new real estate project. On first view the area outside the station, which serves 600,000 rail passengers every day, appears to have gone from hosting a dozen railway lines transporting customers all over the United States, to the large concrete base of the $4.5 billion Manhattan West development. But in reality the tracks are simply hidden from sight and are the trains are now operating as an underground service beneath what will soon become the foundations for two 60 storey office towers on West 33rd Street and Ninth Avenue.

Before: Penn Station  is New York City's main intercity rail terminal - serving up to a thousand passengers every 90 seconds . During: In order for the construction teams to build the platform without disrupting rail services, construction teams used a $7 million crane dubbed 'The Launcher' to lay 16 separate 400 ton bridges . After: The 'bridges' were shunted together to form tunnels through which the trains continue to travel while construction goes on overhead . The Manhattan West development is the latest project by Brookfield Properties, whose workers have spent the past two years hovering precariously above busy railway lines as they built the massive concrete platform. The developer said its construction crews worked day and night for much of that time in order to have the foundation finished by the end of this year, in order to get the construction of the office towers underway in early 2015. Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Brookfield CEO Dennis Friedrich said: 'We celebrate today the creation of land in Manhattan - new land, which doesn't happen very often and which will serve as the support and platform for new buildings to go up in the upcoming years.' In order for the construction teams to build the platform without disrupting rail services, construction teams used a $7 million crane dubbed 'The Launcher' to lay 16 separate 400 ton bridges, which were shunted together to form tunnels through which the trains continue to travel while construction  goes on overhead. Construction: The Manhattan West development is the latest project by Brookfield Properties, whose workers have spent the past two years hovering precariously above busy railway lines as they built the massive concrete platform . Changes: The area outside Penn Station has changed massively over the past two years. The office towers are scheduled to open for businesses to move in at some point in 2018 . Transformed: As can be seen in these before and after images, the tracks have been hidden from sight. The trains are now operating as an underground service beneath what will soon become the foundations for two 60 storey office towers on West 33rd Street and Ninth Avenue . As well as the 60 storey office towers, retail park and green space, Brookfield Properties plans to build an 800 apartment residential tower and a five star hotel on the site. It will also be working to convert other buildings in the area into glass-based structures in order for them to fit in with the new development. Work on the residential tower is due to get underway early next year, with the first residents moving in at some point in 2017. The 800 apartments inside the building have not yet been put up for sale, Brookfield said. The office towers are expected to open the following year.

Penn Station, whose official name is Pennsylvania Station, is New York City's main intercity rail terminal - serving up to a thousand passengers every 90 seconds. It is the busiest passenger transportation facility in North America. The original Pennsylvania Station was inspired by the Gare d'Orsay in Paris and was constructed by the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1901 to 1910. After a decline in passenger usage during the 1950s the original station was demolished in 1963 and replaced in 1969 with the current station. Resurgence of train ridership in the 21st century has pushed the current Pennsylvania Station structure to capacity, leading to several proposals to renovate or rebuild the station.","Area outside the bustling New York train station has been massively transformed over the past two years .

"Six schools at the centre of an alleged Islamist takeover plot are facing radical reform and even  closure after being officially judged as failing, it emerged last night. A three-month inquiry has found the Birmingham schools did too little to protect children from extremism and female staff were intimidated. One of the six, Golden Hillock, has been rated ‘inadequate’ in every criteria. A leaked copy of its Ofsted report says ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex and relationships education has not been delivered properly. Protest: Parents at Birmingham's Al-Hijrah School after its entire governing body was sacked . It found the school’s ‘policies have been given scant consideration’ and its ‘equalities policy is not fit for purpose’. It adds that ‘understanding of other religions is scant’ and Religious Education classes focus primarily on Islam. The six schools face being put into special measures by Ofsted, which investigated 21 schools in relation to an alleged ‘Trojan Horse’ takeover plot in Birmingham by Muslim fundamentalists. The shocking claims – which emerged in March – were that a ‘five-step’ strategy had been drawn up by hardliners intent on ‘Islamising’ schools by ousting unsympathetic teachers and governors. The allegations included claims that pupils were illegally segregated, with girls forced to sit at the back and side of classes, along with suggestions that radical preachers were invited to speak to children. Birmingham City Council and the Department for Education are carrying out separate inquiries. Ofsted is expected to release its full findings next week, but schools have already received their individual reports. Work: The man accused of masterminding the Trojan Horse plot, Tahir Alam, has been working as an Ofsted inspector, according to the BBC . The chairman of governors at the . centre of the alleged Trojan Horse plot has been working as an Ofsted . inspector, it was revealed yesterday. Tahir . Alam has been implicated in the conspiracy involving the alleged . takeover of state schools in Birmingham by Muslim hardliners. The . 45-year-old is chairman of governors at Park View School, one of 21 . schools being probed by the education watchdog, the Department for . Education and Birmingham City Council. Ofsted yesterday confirmed that Mr Alam has worked as an ‘additional inspector’. The . watchdog uses inspectors from three private contractors and Mr Alam’s . name appears on a list published by Tribal, according to the BBC. The Tribal listing from January 2013 says Mr Alam has been working as an inspector since 2010. Mr . Alam has not worked for Tribal since May last year, but he is also . listed by another contractor, CfBT, on a document dated October 2013. It is understood that he has not undertaken inspections on behalf of Ofsted since this date. In . 2007, Mr Alam co-authored a document for the Muslim Council of Britain . which called for state schools to ‘take account of Muslim sensitivities . and sensibilities with respect to sexual morality’ with . ‘girlfriend/boyfriend as well as homosexual relationships’ treated as . ‘not acceptable practices according to Islamic teaching’. Golden Hillock was given the lowest rating in the achievement of pupils, quality of teaching, behaviour and safety of pupils and leadership and management. The first point made in the report is that ‘too little is done to keep students safe from the risks associated with extremist views’. It warns pupils are not being adequately shielded from radical views and that female teachers complained of ‘feeling intimidated by the way in which some male members of the school community speak to them’. Being placed in special measures allows the Department for Education to replace the schools’ governors and possibly senior teachers, including heads. Closure is also an option. The other five schools are Park View School, Nansen Primary, Washwood Heath, Saltley and Oldknow Academy. After the allegations of the plot surfaced earlier this year, Ofsted commissioned an emergency report to investigate practices at 21 schools in Birmingham, including Park View (pictured) Golden Hillock, Park View and Nansen Primary are all run by the Park View Academy Trust, which, according to reports from former teachers, has been infiltrated by Muslim hardliners. Park View’s inadequate grade will come a little more than two years after Ofsted inspectors rated the school as outstanding in all areas and praised it for its excellent academic results and inclusivity. Park View has been condemned in recent weeks by teachers and former teachers for praising extremists in assembly and forcing girls to wear the hijab. A leaked department report in April warned that Park View had practised forced and discriminatory sex segregation and ‘restricted’ GCSE subjects ‘to comply with conservative Islamic teaching’. At Golden Hillock, five Christian students in Year 11 had to ‘teach themselves’ Religious Education, because the teacher gave all the time to students ‘doing the Islamic course’. And at Nansen Primary, inspectors found that Year Six children, aged ten and 11, received no teaching at all in the arts, humanities or music. The department and Birmingham council are expected to release the findings of their investigations next month. A spokesman for Park View Academy Trust refused to comment last night. The leaked Ofsted reports came as 100 parents protested over the sacking of the entire governing body at the Al-Hijrah School in Birmingham. The school was not part of Ofsted’s Trojan Horse inspections, but it was placed in special measures last year after inspectors found ‘inadequate’ teaching, an unbalanced curriculum and governors ‘too heavily involved in the day-to-day running’. With Whitehall’s approval, Birmingham council recently disbanded the governors and appointed a new head and ‘interim executive board’ to run the school.","Three month inquiry by school watchdog found female staff were intimidated .

"A Boeing 777 plane missing feared crashed off the coast of Vietnam was involved in an accident in 2012. The missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft is believed to be the same that crashed into the tail of another plane at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai. The accident happened in August 2012 and broke the wing of the Boeing 777-200 passenger jet. Damaged: The Boeing 777 plane, believed to be the same aircraft that is missing off the coast of Vietnam, was damaged when it collided with another plan while taxiing at Shanghai's Pudong airport in August 2012 . While taxiing at Shanghai's Pudong airport, its wingtip hit the tail of another aircraft. According to an independent accident-tracking site, the damage suffered by the Boeing 777 was 'substantial'. The report filed on the Aviation Safety Network listed the incident, stating: 'A taxiing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 passenger plane contacted the tail of a China Eastern Airlines A340 plane, waiting on the taxiway at Pudong International Airport. no one was injured.'The tip of the wing of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was broken off and hung on the tail of the China Eastern Airbus 340-600, according to pictures posted by passengers on the Internet.' Flight MH307 disappeared off the coast of Vietnam late yesterday when the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers. The Malaysian Airline passenger jet took off from Kuala Lumpur airport at 12.21am local time (4.21pm GMT) bound for Beijing where it was expected to land at 6.30am (10.30pm GMT). But two hours into the flight contact was lost and the plane, having reached 35,000ft, disappeared around 153 miles off the Vietnamese coast. Missing: Malaysia Airlines flight MH307 disappeared off the coast of Vietnam two hours after taking off from Kuala Lumpur airport . Search site: A major search operation was launched off the coast of Phu Quoc island in Vietnam. Vietnamese air force planes spotted two oil slicks, which they believe could indicate the crash site . Delayed: The arrivals board at Beijing airport listed the flight as delayed . A major search operation was launched by Malaysia, Vietnam, China, aided by a host of other nations including the U.S. Two oil slicks were spotted in the Gulf of Thailand by Vietnamese air force planes before the air search was abandoned because of fading daylight. The search continued at sea and the air search is expected to resume in daylight. As Malaysian Airlines released a list of the passengers aboard the plane, it emerged two of the names listed matched passports stolen in Thailand. An Italian national Luigi Maraldi called his parents from Thailand to let them know he is 'alive and well', having heard his name linked to the crash. The Italian foreign ministry said in Rome that an Italian was listed on the flight's manifest although no national from the country was on board. The passenger list provided by the airline includes Luigi Maraldi, 37, an Italian citizen. Newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported that Maraldi's passport was stolen in Thailand last August. The Italian Interior Ministry was unable to immediately comment on the report. In Vienna, the Austrian foreign ministry said an Austrian listed among the passengers was safe and had reported his passport stolen two years ago while he was travelling in Thailand. South China Sea: The search operation spans the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand . Vanishes: A flight tracking website shows the plane's signal stop abruptly not far from Malaysia . Asked for a possible explanation for the plane's disappearance, Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told a news conference: 'We are not ruling out any possibilities.' By late on Saturday night, there were no confirmed signs of the plane or any wreckage, over 20 hours after it went missing. Operations will continue through the night, officials said. The Boeing 777 flown by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared over the South China Sea is one of the world's most popular - and safest - jets. The long-range jumbo jet has helped connect cities at the far ends of the globe, with flights as long as 16 hours. But more impressive is its safety record: The first fatal crash in its 19-year history only came last July when an Asiana Airlines jet landed short of the runway in San Francisco. Three of the 307 people aboard died. Airlines like the plane because it is capable of flying extremely long distances thanks to two giant engines. Each engine is so massive that a row of at least five coach seats could fit inside it. By having just two engines, the plane burns through less fuel than four-engine jets, like the Boeing 747, which it has essentially replaced. 'It has provided a new standard in both efficiency and safety,' said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant with the Teal Group. 'The 777 has enjoyed one of the safest records of any jetliner built.' Feared dead: American Philip Tallmadge Wood, 50, is among the 239 people feared dead. He and two other Americans, Nicole Meng, three, and one-year-old Leo Meng are listed on the passenger list . Missing: Norliakmar Hamid (second right) and her husband Razahan Zamani (right) are among the 239 people missing feared dead . Besides last year's Asiana crash, the only other serious incident with the 777 came in January 2008 when a British Airways jet landed about 1,000 feet short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport. Malaysia Airlines did have an incident in August 2005 with a 777 flying from Perth, Australia, to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's largest city. While flying 38,000 feet above the Indian Ocean, the plane's software incorrectly measured speed and acceleration, causing the plane to suddenly shoot up 3,000 feet. The pilot disengaged the autopilot and descended and landed safely back in Perth. A software update was quickly made on planes around the world. Malaysia Airlines has 15 Boeing 777-200ER jets in its fleet of about 100 planes. The first was delivered on April 23, 1997, and the most recent on December 13, 2004, according to Boeing. The 200ER is one of four versions of the 777. The 777 is capable of flying 7,250 miles non-stop. Its two Rolls-Royce Trent 875 engines each have 74,600lb of thrust, letting the plane cruise at Mach 0.84, or nearly 640 mph. A new model has a list price of 261.5 million US dollars (£156 million), although airlines usually negotiate discounts. The 777 was the first twin-engine plane to be immediately certified to fly over the ocean as far as 180 minutes from any emergency landing airport. Government safety regulators have determined that it could fly for nearly three hours on a single engine in the case of an emergency.","Missing plane was involved in a crash at Shanghai's Pudong airport .

"Playing favorites: The Empire State Building is flying Mayor Bill de Blasio's colors to curry favor with the Democratic Party in advance of a decision about where its 2016 convention will take place . New York City's famed Empire State Building was lit up in blue on Monday night – and will be again on Tuesday – to honor the Democratic National Committee in the hope of luring the party's quadrennial convention and its hundreds of millions of revenue dollars to the Big Apple. The partisan political stunt has passed with little controversy in the heavily Democratic city, although the rules on the building's website declare that the building 'does not light for political figures and campaigns.' The 1931 skyscraper is owned by a private real estate trust that floods its top spire with colored lights about every three days to celebrate holidays, honor sports victories and observe milestone anniversaries for American institutions. Forty such . lightings punctuated the Manhattan skyline between May and July, . including the national colors of World Cup finalists Germany and . Argentina; red, white and blue to acknowledge the 100th anniversary of . Little League baseball; bright green to mark the Muslim holiday Eid . al-Fitr; and blue and yellow to honor 'E.U. Day.' But last week the building's website added . two last-minute observances as the Democrats tasked with choosing a . 2016 convention city prepared to visit New York and hear Mayor Bill de . Blasio's pitch. Republicans are not amused, but also not surprised. 'Welcome . to de Blasio’s New York, where being a liberal Democrat is the top . priority,' Republican National Committee Press Secretary Kirsten . Kukowski told MailOnline. Communist China's 60th anniversary (pictured)? Check. Democratic National Committee? Check. Childhood Cancer Awareness Month? Not so much . Monday and Tuesday night's skyscraper-lighting is part of a push to bring the DNC's 2016 convention to the Big Apple, despite rules prohibiting the use of the spire for political gain . The . RNC chose Cleveland as its host city in July, likely in a bid to curry . favor with voters in the must-win presidential swing state of Ohio. The . Democrats have included Columbus, Ohio's capital, among their final . three contender cities, along with Philadelphia and New York. De Blasio reportedly pressured the Empire State Building's controlling trust to bend its rules against political flattery with a display of 'blue and light blue for the DNC Site Selection Committee visit,' as the building's website describes it. While Democrats had an easy path to seeing their colors 1,453 feet in the air, Fox New York reported that a father whose five-year-old son died of brain cancer was denied the chance to honor Childhood Cancer Awareness month with a gold light-up in September. Shortly before he died, tiny Cole Stoddard told his father, 'I'm not going to grow up to do anything.' Now his father Tony is facing a stone wall in the form of building managers who refuse to honor his request. They cite a policy against agreeing to requests based on 'petitions and/or social media campaigns,' according to the Political Insider blog. In June the building went rainbow for the Gay Pride Week observance in New York City . Bending the rules: Mayor Bill de Blasio aims to outgun Philadelphia and Columbus, Ohio and is pulling out all the stops, including the politicization of a timeless landmark . The building's owners are silent on the effectiveness of requests from the mayor's office, but insist that 'we are unable to light for all who apply.' They famously refused to honor Mother Teresa of Calcutta, the sainted nun, after her death in 2010, but participated in a PR campaign for the 25th anniversary of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise a year earlier. The building also glowed in special hues to launch pop music albums by Alicia Keys in 2012 and Mariah Carey in 2008. Its lighted spire went dark in 2005 when Pope John Paul II died. It also turned bright red to mark the 60th anniversary of Communist China in 2009. Neither Mayor de Blasio's office nor the DNC responded to requests for comment.","Democratic National Committee's 2016 convention site selection committee is in NYC and the light-up stunt is meant to curry favor .

"The number of homes selling for more than £2million has soared by 10 times in less than two decades, official figures show. As the political row rages of Labour's plan to impose a mansion tax on Britain's richest properties, a new heat map reveals how the vast majority of those hit by the levy are in London. But with fewer than 2,500 homes selling for more than £2million last year, there are doubts about how much Ed Miliband's policy will raise. Scroll down for video . Pause the animation at any time by using the control at bottom left of map. Zoom in to any area you like to explore the super high end of the housing market over the last 18 years. Land Registry data shows how in 1995 just 27 houses sold for more than £2million, rising to 417 at the turn of the century and hitting 1,518 in 2010. By 2013 there were 2,490 properties which smashed the £2million mark. A map produced by Lettingstats, part of Lettingweb.com shows where all the sales have been in the last 18 years, and how the vast majority are in London. It also reveals how rising property prices have spread out of the capital, reaching parts of the Home Counties, the Westcountry and the North West. Dan Cookson, head of research at Lettingstats, said: 'With all this talk of Mansion taxes the number one question on my lips was where are all these mansions? 'Our animated Mansiontaxmap clearly shows how London has been the key market for the £2m property over the last 18 years. Over time though the once very rare £2million-plus sale has become more common. 'There were still only 2,490 of them in England & Wales during 2013 versus almost 10,884 £1million-plus sales. 'And they can now be seen in the super high end markets of Poole, Hale near Manchester popular with footballers, and the Cornish and Dorset resorts. 'The exclusive golf centred developments at Wentworth, Royal St Georges are clearly visible as is Cobham home to the Chelsea training ground as well as some of its players.' Land Registry data shows a sharp rise in the number of homes selling for more than £1million, and almost 2,500 selling in 2013 for more than £2million . Under Labour's plans the mansion tax will cost about £250 a month for someone in a home worth between £2million and £3million. It is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in London and the South East – will be caught by the tax. Mr Miliband's mansion tax plans came under fire from former pop singer Myleene Klass this week when she criticised the plan on television. The former Hear'Say singer took the Labour leader to task in a heated TV debate and viewers praised her for 'doing a Paxman' and 'wiping the floor' with him. She told Mr Miliband: 'For me, it's so disturbing – the name in its own right: 'mansion tax'. 'Immediately you conjure up an image of these Barbie-esque houses, but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? It's like a garage. 'When you do look at the people who will be suffering this tax, it's true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time.' Ed Miliband was left humiliated on Monday night after he was unceremoniously taken to task by Miss Klass over Labour’s proposed mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million . In the Commons today David Cameron mocked Mr Miliband for getting a public 'pasting' from Miss Klass. The Labour leader challenged the Prime Minister to back the policy at their weekly Commons face-off, complaining that the owner of a £140 million property in Hyde Park would be paying the same as someone whose home was worth 'a fraction of that value'. But Mr Cameron took the opportunity to raise Mr Miliband's bruising encounter with the model and HearSay singer this week, saying she had 'wiped the floor' with him. Mr Cameron said the Government had 'made sure that the richest in our country have made a contribution by putting up stamp duty'. 'But the point about this is what we need is a growing economy that is providing the jobs, the livelihoods for our people,' he said. 'That is what we are getting. Whereas what he has had in the past week is a pasting from a pop star.' He returned to the subject later in the exchanges, joking: 'This was the week when Myleene Klass wiped the floor with him in a television programme and this was the week when an opinion poll in Scotland showed that more people believe in the Loch Ness monster than believe in his leadership. 'The only problem for the Labour party is he does actually exist.' Prime Minister David Cameron today mocked Labour leader Ed Miliband over his 'pasting from a pop star' as the two men went head to head in the House of Commons . However, Mr Miliband did receive support from Mr Cameron's coalition partner, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. Pointing out that all homes worth more than £700,000 currently pay the same council tax, the Deputy Prime Minister told LBC radio his party had long wanted to introduce a mansion tax and Klass was 'wrong'. 'She also suggested that all you can buy in London was a garage for £2 million. That's some garage,' he said. 'Let's get rid of the emotion about calling it, claiming that one person's normal home is a mansion. 'Why don't we treat higher value properties in the same banded way of putting council tax bands as we do on lower value properties? 'What is possibly fair about saying to a family who live in a family home in Lewisham that they pay the same council tax as an oligarch who lives in a £13m house?'","2,500 houses sold for more than £2million in England and Wales in 2013, official Land Registry figures show .

"World stock markets began to shake today in response to a U.S. government shutdown that shows no signs of ending soon - and could pave the way for a much more devastating default. Investors have generally taken the view that the first such shutdown in 17 years would prove temporary, but there are growing worries about its implications for talks on raising the U.S. public debt ceiling later this month. While the shutdown would have to drag on to have a substantial effect on the United States economy, a failure to raise the debt ceiling carries the threat of a government default on its debt with wide and unpredictable consequences. Sign of the times: A message outside the Lincoln Memorial which has closed due to the government shutdown. Economists are more concerned about a possible U.S. default later this month . America has a legal limit on its borrowing of $16.7trillion dollars, which is predicted to reach that level on October 17. But with Congress failing to agree a budget, there are fears it may also fail to agree an increase on its debt limit by the deadline. Iwan Morgan, a Professor of U.S. Studies and Commonwealth Fund Professor of American History at University College London, told CNN: 'All this may look like a local infighting, but the possible consequences could be global in scope if the stand-off continues until mid-October, when the U.S. is scheduled to raise its debt limit. 'Instability in the world money markets is the last thing that the likes of Greece, Ireland, Spain and even France need. 'If . the U.S. imbroglio results in a debt default next month, it will serve . as a very bad example to eurozone countries undergoing austerity to . remedy their indebtedness.' He said one political ramifications could . be the rise of nationalist and populist parties who may use America's . troubles to legitimise calls for defaults on their country's public . debts. March: Furloughed federal employes march in front of a shuttered Independence Hall at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia . Blockade: A barrier blocks the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in Washington as national parks were closed due the budget battle . Economics commentator Jeremy Warner, the assistant editor of the Daily Telegraph, said the consequences of a default would be cataclysmic. He . said: 'Given the key position occupied by U.S. Treasuries in the . world's money system, the effect of such a default would be like a death . star exploding. 'It . would be Lehman Brothers to the power of a thousand. Indeed, the effect . would be so calamitous that nobody can quite believe it will ever be . allowed to happen.' A recent poll of a majority of . economists, however, found they believe is a less than . 10 per cent chance that Washington's budget feud will lead to the United . States defaulting on any of its debt. The funding cut-off for much of the government began yesterday as a Republican effort to kill or delay the nation's health care law stalled action on a short-term, traditionally routine spending bill. Republicans pivoted to a strategy to try to reopen the government piecemeal but were unable to immediately advance the idea in the House of Representatives. National parks like Yellowstone and Alcatraz Island were shuttered, government websites went dark and hundreds of thousands of nonessential workers reported for a half-day to fill out time cards, hand in their government cellphones and laptops, and change voicemail messages to gird for a deepening shutdown. About 800,000 employees - about a third of the federal workforce - are being forced off the job in the first government shutdown in 17 years, suspending most nonessential federal programs and services. Cataclysmic: Economics commentator Jeremy Warner says a U.S. default would be 'Lehman Brothers times a thousand' People classified as essential employees - such as air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents and most food inspectors - will continue to work. 'We do fear that as this discussion drags on, volatility in the market will continue to increase,' said Patrick Moonen, senior equity strategist at ING Investment Management. The dollar had already suffered on Tuesday as the shutdown began and it fell another 0.6 percent against the yen, seen as a safe haven by investors in times of political strife, to 97.36 yen - its lowest since late August. The euro also drew support from events in Washington but is hampered by an economic outlook that may yet provoke more action - or at least the threat of action - from the European Central Bank, meeting on Wednesday in Paris. The latest round of political turmoil in Italy has not helped the region's prospects - although there are signs that Prime Minister Enrico Letta may be on the verge of assembling enough support to keep his government in power and fend off elections for now. By 0900 GMT, the euro was up about 0.1 percent at $1.3554, nearing an eight-month high touched a day earlier. Global equities, as measured by MSCI's world equity index , were down 0.3 percent after starting the new quarter with a 0.9 percent gain on Tuesday. U.S. stock futures eased 0.2 per cent signaling further weakness ahead while Europe's FTSE 300 index shed 0.75 percent and Asian shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent. 'With the U.S. shutdown, everyone is hoping for the best,' said Luca Jellinek, head of European interest rates strategy at Credit Agricole CIB.

"Manuel Pellegrini has set the stage for today’s title showdown between Chelsea and Manchester City by telling Diego Costa to clean up his act, and rejecting claims from Jose Mourinho that there is a campaign against the Barclays Premier League leaders. Chelsea, who were last night tying up the £26.8million signing of Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina, will be without Costa at Stamford Bridge after he was given a three-game ban for stamping on Liverpool’s Emre Can in the Capital One Cup semi-final. And Pellegrini said: ‘I know of Diego Costa from Spain. His character is not an easy character.’ The Chilean believes the striker has to curb his aggressive streak. ‘I hope that this punishment will be a good thing for him to change in the future,’ he added. Costa has been in excellent form this season, leading the Premier League scoring charts with 17 goals . Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has urged Chelsea forward Diego Costa to learn from his mistake . Liverpool players react after Costa stamps on Emre Can (number 23) during the League Cup semi-final . ‘He doesn’t need to do it in that way because he is a very good player. But I am sure Chelsea will not lose their next three games just because he isn’t playing. Big teams cannot depend on just one player. Asked if Costa’s ban cancelled out Yaya Toure’s absence on duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, Pellegrini added: ‘I don’t think it helps anything. I think that Diego Costa is an important player for Chelsea and Yaya is a very important player for us. But I don’t think they decide that both teams depend on just those players. ‘So I think it is a very important miss for both teams but Chelsea have other players to replace him. ‘Yaya is a very important player for us but I was not decided that, if he was eliminated from the Africa Cup, he would come and play here two days afterwards because I do not think it is the correct way to do it. We played without Yaya in Rome and qualified in the Champions League and against Bayern Munich, so it is up to other players to demonstrate what they can do.’ Costa's ban means the striker will not feature in The Blues' potential title-decider with Manchester City . Champions City will fall eight points behind Chelsea if they lose today but Pellegrini refused to be drawn on his rivalry with Mourinho. He refused to shake hands with Mourinho over his antics when Fernando Torres scored a late winner in the corresponding fixture last season, and compared Chelsea to Stoke after their defensive tactics earned a 1-1 draw at the Etihad in September. ‘I won’t talk about what Mourinho might do,’ said Pellegrini. ‘I will shake hands with him before the game. And after? Yes, probably. ‘It was a mistake to compare Chelsea with Stoke. Chelsea can play in the way they want and we are going to continue playing in the style I think is best for this team.’ Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (left) is currently on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations . Pellegrini also dismissed Mourinho’s claims that there is a ‘campaign’ against Chelsea within the Premier League which is influencing referees’ decisions against the leaders. ‘I hope that in the Premier League they don’t have a campaign against anyone,’ he said. ‘I hope the referee makes mistakes for all the teams exactly the same, that the FA make the fixtures in a fair way and the punishments. ‘It is the best league in the world and I don’t think it has any strange things. Because (if that is the case) then you are not competing (fairly). After that, if you win the title, it’s not an important title, because it is all arranged.’ Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard spent 13 years as a Chelsea player, winning three league titles . Pellegrini, who revealed that Samir Nasri and Eliaquim Mangala are injury doubts, believes that Frank Lampard will be given a good reception on his return to Stamford Bridge where she spent 13 years as a player, whether the former England midfielder would celebrate a goal against his old club or not. He added: ‘First I prefer him to score the goal. After that we will see if he celebrates or if he doesn’t celebrate. If he scores, I celebrate. ‘I am sure that Frank Lampard will receive the best reception from their fans that they can do. He is a top player. He is maybe the most important in their history. He gave so many things to that club. If he couldn’t continue playing there, he can play here. That is not his fault. I am sure the fans will repeat the reception they gave here to Frank in the first game.’ Meanwhile, Cuadrado will fly in from Italy on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich’s private jet on Saturday to complete his move to Stamford Bridge, with Mohamed Salah set to move in the other direction on loan. Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella confirmed on Friday a deal for the Colombia winger had been agreed, saying: ‘It was a sale that had to be done. I’m happy for him because he is going to a big club.’ The clash between Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini's sides could potentially decide the league title .","Manuel Pellegrini says Diego Costa must accept his three-game ban .

"Samsung is distancing itself further from Google's Android platform with the launch of the world's first Tizen smartphone. Earlier this year, its Samsung Gear 2 became the first smartwatch to run the Linux-based software, and now it has unveiled the Samsung Z -  a 4.8-inch device that will directly compete with Google's range. It will go on sale in Russia from July this year, before being launched in other markets - although Samsung did not confirm which countries were set to get the device, or how much it will cost. Samsung has unveiled its first phone to run the Tizen operating system, called the Samsung Z (pictured). It will launch in Russia from July this year, and boasts, among other features, a fingerprint and heart rate sensor. Tizen is seen as a direct competitor to Google's Android platform . The new smartphone will be unveiled Tuesday at the Tizen Developer Conference in San Francisco. Most of Samsung's devices, including its flagship Galaxy S smartphones, currently use a skinned version of the Android operating system. This means the software runs on Android, but Samsung adds its own design, menus and tools for use on its own devices.

Fingerprint scanner . Heart rate sensor . The electronics giant has tried for years to strengthen its mobile software business as a genuine complement to its mighty device-making operations. Its first homegrown operating system - the 2009 software named Bada  - largely flopped following a lukewarm response from app developers. Samsung worked with Intel, and other tech firms to develop the Linux-based Tizen platform, which is open-source - meaning hardware manufacturers that use it can freely tinker with the interface. Tizen is the platform for Samsung's Gear 2 smartwatch launched in February, but the Samsung Z will be the first phone to use the operating system. It can run Android apps when used with certain software elements, but Samsung is hoping developers will create native Tizen apps, too. 'The Samsung Z integrates the power and adaptability of the Tizen platform, enabling users to browse the web faster and utilize applications more effectively,' D.J. Lee, Samsung's head of global sales and marketing said in a statement. Samsung made more than 30 per cent of all smartphones sold in the world last year, nearly twice the share of its archrival Apple. The move to Tizen is seen as being an attempt to unify an operating system across Samsung's devices. With Tizen already used on its smartwatches, its understood the company was keen to get phones running it as well. The operating system is also thought to provide better support for the HTML5 web language, which is increasingly becoming more popular among developers building websites. 'The Tizen platform delivers a fast, optimal performance with improved memory management,' Samsung wrote on its blog. 'The Tizen-based Samsung Z offers a faster startup time and immediate multi-tasking capabilities. 'The Samsung Z fully supports superb 2D and 3D graphic qualities, smoother scrolling and an improved rendering performance for web browsing. 'Users will also be able to enjoy safe and secure privacy protection using the built-in fingerprint sensor.' And the company added an Ultra Power Saving Mode keeps the phone operational even when battery levels are at a minimum. Other features, including the heart rate sensor found on the back of the phone, have been tried and tested on previous phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S4. Meanwhile, in an attempt to get developers on board with Tizen, Samsung said it will have a special promotional programme for one year for developers on its own native app store. Samsung already uses the Tizen operating system on its Gear 2 smartwatch (pictured). The release of a phone running Tizen is seen as an attempt to unify the operating system between its various devices. Tizen also runs using HTML5, the popular web language of choice over Java and Flash . The vast majority of Samsung's current smartphones, including the Samsung Galaxy S3 (pictured), run Google's Android Platform. Tizen will be Samsung's first attempt at irunning a unique operating since Bada, which launched in 2009 but flopped after receiving a lukewarm response from developer .","Samsung has unveiled a smartphone running the Linux-based software .

"Not understanding a partner's needs, money and patience are the issues Australian couples fight about the most, according to a new study. The research was conducted by online dating site, eHarmony, and also found compromise - not make-up sex - was the most effective way to resolve an issue in a relationship. Almost two-thirds of couples surveyed said they believed not understanding their partner's needs put more strain on their relationship than any other issue. Not understanding a partner's needs, money and patience are the issues couples fight about the most, according to a new study . Almost two-thirds of couples surveyed said they believed not understanding their partner's needs put more strain on their relationship than any other issue . While financial issues came in at second place on 57 per cent, not being patient with each other followed on 51 per cent. But eHarmony dating and relationship expert Melanie Schilling said there were underlying reasons as to why these problems kept coming up. 'Money fights, for example, are rarely ever actually about money,' Ms Schilling said. 'There's usually an underlying factor that fuels it, around something that matters more like fear of not having influence over important issues that could impact the relationship.' Married couple Fiona Caddies and Bjorn Miller told Daily Mail Australia the key to maintaining their relationship was communicating each other's needs . The research also found certain age groups were more likely to fight about particular issues. More Australians between the ages of 35 and 49 quarrelled over financial problems while those from 18 to 24 and 25 to 34 were more likely to clash over not understanding their partner's needs. Ms Schilling said it was also great to see couples were using a more holistic approach to resolving conflicts rather than having make-up sex. More than 60 per cent of Australians are using the conciliation method - a process of compromise - to resolve an argument, while 55 per cent followed a cooperation method, which is a win-win solution. 'While this [sex] may be effective in the short term, it doesn't allow for the chance to actually discuss and resolve the issue,' Ms Schilling said. 'When handled correctly, conflict can actually be an opportunity for learning, growth and positive change.' The study also found men and women had different views of what causes conflict to arise. Women believe a clash of morals and beliefs, a lack of compromise, and a build-up of small issues were more likely to cause an argument than men. Married couple Fiona Caddies and Bjorn Miller - who spent two years living apart and met through eHarmony - told Daily Mail Australia the key to maintaining their relationship was communicating each other's needs. The study was conducted by online dating site, eHarmony, and also found compromise - not make-up sex - was the most effective way to resolve an issue in a relationship . She said they used a shared calendar to tell each other which appointments and events were most important to attend so their partner would know what to prioritise. 'We probably learned more about each other because we had to organise our lives through shared calendars,' Ms Caddies said. 'The shared calendar was colour-coded so we knew what was important, so we knew what each other's doing.'","The new research was conducted by online dating website, eHarmony .

"'Clear contempt': French Economy minister Emmanuel Macron has come under fire for describing female factory workers as 'illiterate' France's new economy minister is facing calls to quit after just two weeks in the job for calling female factory workers 'illiterate'. Emmanuel Macron's scathing slur came just days after President Francois Hollande was accused of calling the poor 'the toothless'. Former Rothschild banker Macron, 36, issued the insult on Europe 1 radio when asked about women workers at the bankrupt Gad abattoir near Paris. He told listeners: 'In this company, there is a majority of women. Many of them are illiterate. 'Many of them have been told they have have no future in Gad or nearby, and they need to go and work 50 or 60 kilometres away. 'These people have no driving licences. What can one say to them?' The new minister was swiftly attacked for his comments by left and right wing MPs. Right wing member Marc Le Fur said: 'The prime minister should send Mr Macron back to Rothschild.' The Force Ouvriere union leader Jean Marc Detivelle added: 'It's clear contempt for workers.' Macron was forced to issue a grovelling recantation later on Wednesday, saying: 'My humblest apologies go to the workers who I may have hurt with this comment for which I can never be sorry enough.' France's anti-illiteracy group Agence Nationale de Lutte Contre l'Illettrisme estimates that seven per cent of French people read so poorly they are effectively illiterate. Macron's remark came as part of his first major interview since taking up his job after Hollande sacked his predecessor, the maverick left-wing dissident Arnaud Montebourg. He also said in the same interview that France was 'sick' and desperately needed pro-business reforms to recover from stagnation and 'mass unemployment'. Hollande was expected to hold a rare and hotly awaited news conference later today as the embattled and deeply unpopular leader seeks to turn the tide on a catastrophic few weeks. The subjects are likely to range from France's engagement in Iraq to the dire state of the economy to the president's love life - although he is unlikely to offer further enlightenment on this last topic. Two weeks ago, former French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler claimed in her new book that her ex-lover President Hollande 'does not like poor people' and refers to them as 'the toothless'. Bitter split: Former French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler (left) claimed in her new book that her ex-lover President Francois Hollande 'does not like poor people' and refers to them as 'the toothless' Embittered Ms Trierweiler, 49, who was dumped by Hollande for a glamorous actress, wrote: 'He portrays himself as a man who doesn't like the rich. 'But in reality, the president does not like poor people. 'He, a man of the left, says in private 'les sans-dents' (the toothless), and he is very proud of his humour.' When Mr Hollande denied the claim, Ms Trierweiler said she had 'solid proof' of his comments and would use it if he ever took her to court for libel.

"A woman has been left scarred for life after a beautician botched a laser hair removal treatment - on her face. Mum-of-two Vanda Thomas, 55, has terrible scarring under her chin after she spent £50 to get some wispy hairs removed at her local salon. But instead of leaving her with a smooth chin, Vanda is forced to cover up her scars daily with heavy make-up, after the unqualified beautician scored her face with deep burns by using the powerful laser on its highest setting. Scroll down for video . Vanda Thomas (left) shows the burns she suffered after she underwent laser hair removal treatment (right) Vanda, a healthcare worker from Ilford, north London, went to the salon in February to treat herself to a confidence-boosting treatment, after she began noticing a small number of hairs sprouting from under her chin. She said: 'I had been there before for facials and massages, and the woman was really nice and friendly. 'I thought long and hard about having laser hair removal treatment, and then decided I should go for it,' she says. 'When she put the laser on, it hurt so much I jumped out of the chair. It was such an intense burning. 'The woman said it was normal, and did another patch, but that hurt just as bad. 'Then she said that maybe she should turn the laser down. I have a high threshold for pain, but that was absolutely agonising,' adds Vanda. Left: the burns straight after the treatment; Right: how they look 6 months later . After completing the 20-minute treatment, Vanda left the salon with a burning sensation in her face. It was only the next day that she realised something was seriously wrong, when her skin broke out in sores and blisters. Her doctor told her the laser had caused first degree burns in her skin, which would leave permanent scarring. Now Vanda has teamed up with a trade body, to call for tougher regulations for laser hair removal treatment. The Association of Independent Healthcare Organisations is lobbying the government to introduce an official register of approved practitioners to prevent further injuries like Vanda’s. Vanda said: 'It was only afterwards that I realised these people didn’t need any training, or licencing, to operate quite dangerous machinery. 'My face felt like it was on fire for days - all because she didn’t know how to operate the machine. 'I want nobody else to go through what I’ve had to endure, and that’s why we need to make a change in the law to make certain these people have proper training. 'At the moment we are unprotected by rogue beauty therapists with powerful lasers.' Mum-of-two Vanda spent £50 to get some wispy hairs removed at her local beautician . AIHO operational director Sally Taber explained: 'There isn’t any regulation at the moment and that puts people at risk, so always background check a practitioner and ask if they have had the training before considering treatment. 'It was found that there hasn’t been as much risk with lasers, hence why the government does not support regulation - yet this is a problem but it’s the responsibility of the patients to find out about the practitioner.' Laser hair removal, which involves high-powered laser lights killing hair follicles at the root, was regulated by the Care Quality Commission until 2010 when it stopped approving licences for non-surgical procedures. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We want to make sure everybody who undergoes laser hair removal receives good standards of care and is aware of the risks. 'We are working with Health Education England to review training and qualifications for providers of non-surgical interventions - including laser hair removal.' Sk:n are the UK’s leading laser hair removal providers, who have held a partnership with the NHS for more than 20 years. The lasers used at sk:n are safe to use with all skin types and treatment is delivered according to strict medical protocols, as monitored by in-house Medical Directors. Only practitioners who have completed months of intensive, supervised training and have achieved medical sign off are allowed to treat.

"President Barack Obama said Monday that installing a new prime minister in Iraq will be 'an important step toward forming a new government that can unite' the hodgepodge of ethnic and religious sects that dominate life in the Middle Eastern country. Between a beach afternoon . on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard and a Democratic Party . fundraiser 15 miles away in the town of Tisbury, Obama's said in a four-minute speech that 'the only lasting solution is for Iraqis to come together and form an inclusive government -- one that represents the legitimate interests of all Iraqis.' Mobilizing new kinds of U.S. support for Iraq, he claimed, standing in a small clearing flanked by trees, 'will be easier once that new government is in place.' An already incendiary situation in Baghdad threatened to reach new levels of tension Monday, when Iraqi President Fuad Masum dismissed Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and elevated his deputy parliament speaker Haider al-Ibadi to replace him. Obama is standing behind the appointment of a new prime minister despite rallies in Baghdad's streets calling for the current PM to remain in power . No news: Obama is vacationing with his family -- golfing, beachcoming, and attending a fundraiser -- and took four minutes to reiterate what his administration has been telling reporters all day . Iraqis loyal to ousted Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki took to the streets of Baghdad on Monday with signs reading 'Maliki is our choice' Persecuted: Displaced people from the Kurdish minority Yazidi religious sect have fled violence by the tens of thousands, leading Obama to authorize airstrikes against ISIS in order to prevent mass killings . Obama said he had personally called al-Ibadi to offer his support. The White House said earlier in the day . that Vice President Joe Biden spoke with both Masum and al-Ibadi. According to a report from the White House Press Office, Biden reminded Masum . of 'President Obama's repeated calls for the timely creation of a . new, more inclusive government that will be able to address the . legitimate concerns of all Iraqis. Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville said Monday that U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft have executed 15 . targeted airstrikes in and around . the Kurdish territorial capital of Erbil since Saturday morning. The U.S. and Britain have collaborated, he added, to deliver 14 humanitarian airdrops of relief supplies to Kurdish Yazidis, a minority religious sect in Iraqi Kurdistan. 'I . want to thank in particular the United Kingdom, France, and other . countries working with us to provide much needed assistance to the Iraqi . people,' Obama said Monday. 'And, . meanwhile, our aircraft remain positioned to strike any terrorist . forces around the mountain who threaten the safety of these families.' Obama . justified his airstrikes Friday on humanitarian grounds, saying in a . press conference that he aimed to stop a Yazidi genocide. An estimated 40,000 of them took refuge last week . on a mountain, with no food or water, as ISIS Islamists slashed and . killed their way through northwestern Iraq. The . Associated Press reported that American warplanes struck a convoy of . ISIS militants headed in the direction of Kurdish 'Peshmerga' soldiers on Monday. The Kurds successfully recaptured two towns over the weekend, marking . their first victories after a seemingly endless retreat. Al-Maliki's Shiite coalition government . coasted to victory in April elections, but that was before the . self-styled 'Islamic State in Iraq and Syria' (ISIS) terrorist militias . launched a devastating Islamist jihad offensive and claimed vast parts . of Iraq's territories. Amid cries about a government coup, al-Maliki's backers danced in the streets and chanted their support. The two-term prime minister had said he would seek a third term despite calls for his ouster from Kurds, Sunnis and even his fellow Shiites. He insisted Monday that he should remain since his party still controls a parliamentary majority. Life or death: U.S. Air Force pilots have dropped pallets of bottled water and other supplies from planes like this C-17 Globemaster III at least 14 times since August 8, aiming to sustain isolated Yazidi Kurds as ISIS terrorists advance on them . Masum, like Obama, favors a broader coalition government can unite his country against ISIS, which has run a deadly campaign of terror in the nation's north, and moved perilously close to Baghdad. In an address televised in Iraq, Syria and Iran, he set a 30-day deadline for al-Ibadi to form a new government coalition and present it for parliament's approval. House Speaker John Boehner charged an hour before Obama's speech that he was unprepared – after more than 5-1/2 years in office – to face the challenges of Iraq's re-emergence as a terror hotbed. 'The crisis in Iraq caught the Obama administration completely off guard,' Boehner said in a statement. 'With the Middle East in chaos, the president's campaign line about terrorists being ""on the run"" seems like wishful thinking at best.' 'The Obama administration's lack of engagement over the last few years' in Iraq, he claimed, 'created an opening for Islamic radicals to take control of large swaths of the country.' The normally left-leaning Washington Post editorial board conceded on Sunday that 'Mr. Obama lacks a plausible plan for addressing the larger threat posed by the Islamic State.' At the same . time, Obama's move to authorize limited airstrikes in Iraq's northern . regions is being credited for helping Kurdish 'Peshmerga' forces defend . Erbil, the capital of their autonomous region. OUT: Nouri al-Maliki has been pushed out of the prime minister's chair in Iraq . IN: Shiite lawmaker Haider al-Ibadi has been elevated by Iraq's president, but not without controversy . Fire from the skies: ISIS militants have seen strategic positions destroyed or cut off by missile strikes from fighter jets since Saturday morning . Since declaring itself to be an Islamic caliphate on June 10, ISIS has fought with Syria's army, tribal groups from Sunni regions of Iraq, and Peshmerga militias in Iraqi Kurdistan. ISIS militants have also been on the march in Syria, crushing resistance and executing 25 of their opponents – including two by execution – according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Republican lawmakers griped on Sunday political talk shows yesterday, claiming that Obama's cautious approach to pinprick bombing strikes would allow ISIS to grow to the point where it endangers American interests. 'If he does not go on the offensive against ISIS ... they are coming here,' South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Fox News Sunday. 'And if we do get attacked, then he will have committed a blunder for the ages.' 'What a weak leader,' New York Republican Rep. Peter King carped on NBC's show Meet the Press. 'We're gonna attack this, but we're not gonna do this, we're not gonna do that.

"Louis van Gaal admits he is no closer to knowing Manchester United’s best formation after seven months in charge at Old Trafford. Van Gaal has reverted to a defensive back four and a midfield diamond in recent games, coming under fire for playing England striker Wayne Rooney in a deeper role. Former United favourite Paul Scholes described watching his old club as ‘miserable’ and criticised their negative tactics, although Van Gaal refused to be drawn into a public row at his weekly press conference. Louis van Gaal speaks to the press ahead of Monday's FA Cup fifth round clash with Preston . Van Gaal admitted he still doesn't know what his best Manchester United formation formation is . However, when asked if he knows his best system, the United boss said: ‘No, I don’t think so. I have played now already five or six systems and I am looking still for the balance. ‘But this system is more attractive and I can play with more attacking players. That’s the reason I am doing that. ‘In spite of the fact that we are looking for the balance, our results and our defensive organisation are not bad, and we also score a lot of goals. So, I cannot say that I am very disappointed about that.’ Three days after he arrived to face the media armed with statistical evidence to counter claims from West Ham manager Sam Allardyce that United are turning into a long ball team, Van Gaal resisted the temptation to hit back at Scholes over his comments. They followed United’s unconvincing win at home to Burnley on Wednesday that extended their current run to just one defeat in 18 games but drew widespread criticism. Phil Jones was forced off the pitch during the game against Burnley on Tuesday and is a doubt for Preston . Van Gaal sidestepped the Scholes issue, however, saying: ‘I don’t worry about that, it’s not so interesting. ‘Paul Scholes is one of the fans and fans can criticise us, that’s not a problem. That’s all I have to say on that. ‘I am used to it and I think all the players are used to it because they are not first time professional football players. ‘Maybe some players are affected, but normally most of the time it does not affect me or the players.’ Phil Jones was forced off the pitch during the game against Burnley on Tuesday and is a doubt for Preston . United are away to Preston North End in the FA Cup fifth round on Monday night, and Van Gaal revealed that Phil Jones, Daley Blind and Robin van Persie are all doubts for the tie at Deepdale. Jones and Blind both went off before half-time against Burnley with knee and head injuries respectively, while Van Persie’s problem is unknown. Van Gaal said: ‘Jones is not a heavy injury but it will be difficult for him. We’ll have to wait and see how Blind recovers and Van Persie has something. I gave the players the day off and only the injured players are in.’ Van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Marcos Rojo celebrate the recent win over Burnley . Having already faced lower division opposition away in the last two rounds, the United boss knows what to expect from League One Preston. ‘The FA Cup is fantastic,’ said Van Gaal. ‘You know the world is against you because everybody is for the underdog. ‘The chance you can survive is higher because you are playing against lower quality but you have to beat a team with big motivation.’ Manchester United will also be without Daley Blind who was also injured during the win against Burnley .

"Rates of short sightedness among young Britons have soared because of smartphones, a leading laser eye surgeon has claimed . Rates of short sightedness among young people have soared because of smartphones, a leading laser eye surgeon has claimed. David Allamby, Founder of Focus Clinics, says there has been a 35 per cent increase in the number of people with advancing myopia (short sightedness) since the launch of smartphones in 1997. He has warned the problem could increase by 50 per cent in the next ten years. Mr Allamby thinks the problem is so widespread that he has dubbed it ‘screen sightedness’. He says that half of Britons own smartphones and that they spend an average of two hours a day using them . This, along with time spent using computers and watching television, is putting children and young people at risk of permanently damaging their sight. New research found that the average smartphone user holds the handset 30 cm from their face - with some people holding it just 18cm away - compared to newspapers and books, which are held 40cm away from the eyes. According to Mr Allamby, excessive screen watching at close proximity keeps the genes that control myopia activated well beyond the age that short-sighted would historically have stabilised - about 21. Myopia used to stop developing in people’s early 20s but now it is now seen progressing throughout the 20s, 30s, and even 40s. Mr Allamby said: ‘If things continue as they are, I predict that 40 to 50 per cent of 30-year-olds could have myopia by 2033 as a result of smartphones and lifestyles in front of screens – an epidemic we call screen sightedness. ‘People need to ensure they limit screen time wherever possible even by going outside without their phone for a period of time each day (getting out into the sunshine has been shown to reduce the progression of short-sight), and also seriously consider the age at which they give their children a smartphone.’ Mr Allamby says today's children are most at risk of myopia – with children as young as seven being given smartphones. David Allamby says there has been a 35 per cent increase in the number of people with advancing myopia since the launch of smartphones in 1997 . It is predicted that by 2014 teenagers . aged 12 to 17 will be the second biggest market for smartphones behind . 18 to 24-year-olds. Mr Allamby's claims are supported by previous research which has shown that using a smartphone can damage people's vision and cause headaches. Researchers at the University of California found that the problem is the demand on the eyes to focus on the screen and simultaneously adjust to the distance of the content. The phenomenon is known as 'vergence-accommodation' and experiments found people suffered discomfort when content from mobile phones appeared in front of the screen rather than behind it.","David Allamby says there has been a 35% increase in the number of people with advancing myopia since the launch of smartphones in 1997 .

"President Barack Obama warned Republicans in Congress on Friday that he was prepared to act without them to plug financial holes in America's immigration infrastructure, which is increasingly burdened by a flood of children and teens slipping into the U.S. from the south. 'While they're on vacation, I'm going to have to make some tough choices to meet the challenge, with or without Congress,' he said during a 45-minute-long press conference at the White House. Obama's opening statements were entirely about domestic issues, but journalists in the room asked mostly about foreign policy, teeing up softballs about Russia's antagonism in Ukraine and the Israel-Hams conflict. 'I thought you guys were going to ask me how I was going to spend my birthday,' Obama said near the end of his appearance in the press briefing room. Scroll down for video . Ready to go it alone: Obama warned he will continue his pattern of making laws without Congress if they don't act on his immigration funding request . The president took questions but reporters were mostly interested in foreign policy, not his immigration squabbles with the GOP . Reporters' actual interest in immigration seemed limited to why Republicans don't trust the White House to act in good faith, given the president's habit of issuing high-profile executive orders without their consent. In turn, the president was most focused on needling his GOP opposition about their lack of enthusiasm for passing immigration legislation, saying he expects to 'act on my own to solve the problem' while they are away from Washington for the next five weeks. Citing '80 per cent' of border issues on which he claimed 'there is agreement' between House Republican leaders and his administration, he skewered his opposition for its intramural squabbling – most in evidence Thursday night as warring GOP factions held a funding bill in limbo. That measure would have provided Obama with $659 million, a fraction of the $3.7 billion he has asked for. Competing versions passed around the Republican caucus focused alternatively on funding to strengthen the border and an outright ban on any White House efforts to expand the Deferred Action . for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a 2012 mini-amnesty program for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The result, said Obama is 'not a disagreement between me and . the House Republicans; it's a disagreement between the House . Republicans and the House Republicans.' Conservatives in the House Republican . caucus are most worried about the possibility that Obama could . unilaterally make a larger move than just rearranging Border Patrol . budgets: They fret about an executive expansion of DACA, and have pushed for any border bill to include an outright prohibition on the program's growth. Rep. John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican, summed up the situation on Capitol Hill by telling The Hill that the conflict is 'insurmountable.' 'We are a completely wide spectrum' of opinion, he said. 'We've got some members of the House Republicans, and maybe even in the Senate, that agree with Democrats much more on this issue than Republicans.' 'But on top of that, you've got a president who does what he wants – who ignores the law, enforces only parts that he wants – and we can't trust that he'll do anything.' On Thursday, House GOP leaders withdrew their own bill from consideration after it became clear that not enough Republicans would support it in a vote. Almost immediately, White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer presaged Obama's likely move to make a unilateral policy change. 'By pulling their own bill,' he tweeted, 'the House GOP once again proves why the President must act on his own to solve problems.' The GOP was set to give up but House Speaker John Boehner and newly minted Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy brought boos and catcalls by announcing that they would delay the August recess for another day of wrangling. The most recent rewrite added $35 million for an increased National Guard presence on the U.S.-Mexico border, but it's unclear if that will be enough to cement a Republican coalition large enough to bring the measure to a vote – and then to an inevitable rejection in the Senate. The game is a familiar one in Washington, with the two house of Congress controlled by opposing parties and trying their best to not be the chamber holding the legislative ball when the music stops before a month-long intermission. Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said Friday that 'when it comes to the humanitarian crisis on our southern border, President Obama has been completely AWOL – in fact, he has made matter[s] worse by flip-flopping on the 2008 law that fueled the crisis.' 'Senate Democrats have left town without acting on his request for a border supplemental [budget request]. Right now, House Republicans are the only ones still working to address this crisis.' Man of the hour: On his first day in a new leadership role. House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy had to tell a groaning House chamber that the August recess was delayed . No drama: Obama seemed unflappable as he cautioned Republicans against defying his immigration funding demands . Obama has suggested he would veto any bill that denied his administration the funding he wants – most of which would grow programs that process and house the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children pouring across the border. Less than 3 per cent of his funding proposal would beef up border security. But he insisted Friday that a cash-strapped federal government would soon lack the means to respond to the current problem without Republicans' say-so. 'We've got to take action,' he said, referring to his domestic policy team at the White House. 'I'm going . to have to act alone because we don't have the resources. We've already . been clear. We don't have the money. ... We're going to have to . reallocate some resources.' Instead of writing him a blank check, Obama complained, the Republican Party's right wing has been steering the discussion toward solutions that are destined to meet his veto pen. 'House Republicans as we speak are trying to pass the most extreme and unworkable version of a bill that they already know is going nowhere, that can't pass the Senate,' the president said Friday. 'They're not even trying to to solve the problem,' he said. 'This is a message bill ... just so they can check a box before leaving town tomorrow.' Each side of the ideological aisle has accused the other of posturing for political gain as fundraising kicks into high gear for November's congressional midterm elections. DELUGE: A flood of new illegal immigrants, mostly children and teens, has swept across the southwest U.S. border in the two years since Obama announced a mini-amnesty for those who arrived unlawfully as children before 2007 . In the Democrat-controlled Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid failed Thursday to advance a smaller $2.7 billion version of Obama's supplemental funding request, effectively killing it until September. The measure was killed on a 50-44 procedural vote, fully 10 votes shy of what was needed to stop debate and vote on the bill's merits. Several moderate Democrats, including some facing tough re-election fights, voted 'no.' Obama only briefly mentioned his usually foremost 'comprehensive immigration reform' refrain, claiming that his preferred approach – a complete overhaul of American immigration policy – 'might have . forestalled some of the problems we're seeing now in the Rio Grande . valley with these undocumented children.' He has argued in the past that a rewrite of immigration law would give him the power to stop pursuing illegal immigrants who came as children – so-called DREAMers – and redirect those resources to more pressing problems at the border. But in teeing up Democrats' disgust with slow-moving Republicans, he set the stage for an August recess full of recriminations about a 'do-nothing' Republican House. 'If in fact House Republicans are concerned about me acting independently of Congress ... then the easiest way to solve it is – pass some legislation. Get things done.'","President is angry at House Republicans for refusing to consider his $3.7 billion supplemental funding request .
Most of that ask would pay to care for thousands of illegal immigrant children, while just a few per cent would strengthen the U.S. border .

"President Obama was back on the golf course today as he enjoyed yet another 18 holes amid deepening concerns about the spreading terrorist rampage of extremist group ISIS. The President played a round with former NBA basketball star Alonzo Mourning and Cyrus Walker, cousin of White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, at Farm Neck Golf Club, in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts on Saturday. His hours on the golf course during a two-week break on the resort island of Martha's Vineyard have his detractors teeing up as they highlight the slew of foreign policy crises currently facing the U.S. Scroll down for video .

Obama, right, smiles while standing on the green with Cyrus Walker, left, cousin of White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, as they golf at Farm Neck Golf Club today . On Friday, the FBI and Homeland Security warned police forces across the country to be on the lookout for terrorist threats as a chilling note was posted online warning that Chicago could be an ISIS target. The federal agencies sent a bulletin on Friday to law enforcement agencies warning them to be on the lookout for terrorism. Although no specific threats have been identified, they could not guarantee no future attacks, the federal agencies said. Chicago in particular has become a prime target because extremist groups think of it as 'Obama Town', a security expert told CBS. A tweet, posted on June 20, has been discovered, showing pictures of the Old Republic Building in Chicago and the White House with a message reportedly from the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL). The note read: 'We are in your state/We are in your cities/We are in your streets/You are our goals anywhere.' The brutal capabilities of ISIS were revealed on Tuesday after a stomach-churning video released showed the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley at the hands of a hooded militant. President Barack Obama selects a club while golfing at Farm Neck Golf Club. His time on the green has come under fire from critics due to the growing international threat posed by extremist group ISIS . President Barack Obama, left, shakes hands with Walker. The White House has defended the President's golfing saying that it is important that he blows off steam . In the aftermath of Mr Foley's beheading, the President is weighing up how to increase his military campaign against ISIS as the US edges closer to strikes in Syria. Having already conducted limited air-strikes against ISIS positions in northern Iraq to aid Kurdish fighters for humanitarian reasons, the White House is examining its legal options to launch raids across the border to hit the terror groups stronghold. Preferably Congress would pass a resolution to provide the domestic legal justification for attacks against the Sunni Muslim group that now operates its Islamic State that ranges nearly from Baghdad to Damascus. Under discussion by the administration is to invoke the War Powers Resolution which constitutionally allows emergency military actions to protect US citizens, but would need an extension granted by Congress. The president authorized the current strikes in Iraq under that, which is legally sound for 60 days, but expires in early October. Obama rides in a golf cart with former NBA basketball player Alonzo Mourning. The President has spent two weeks on vacation on the holiday resort of Martha's Vineyard . However, if the president wants to increase his military involvement into Syria he is expected to seek the approval of a Congress already uneasy about the limits of presidential authority to make war. An official with the White House has not ruled out immediate air strikes in Syria against ISIS according to the Washington Post under the guise of protecting US citizens. The growing number of foreign policy dilemmas has the president's aides confronting a question it faces whenever Obama gets away: Is there ever a good time for the commander in chief to take a few days off? The White House suggested on Friday that Obama was trying to work out his tensions when he played 18 holes of golf on Wednesday – complete with grins and fist-bumps – immediately after delivering a brief but moving speech condemning the gruesome execution of Mr Foley. And adding to the week of optics problems, Secretary of State John Kerry was spotted sailing off the island of Nantucket while the Pentagon and White House answered tough questions about the Middle East. Obama doubles over with laughter during his relaxing two-week holiday in the exclusive president's playground of Martha's Vineyard . Obama was golfing with two friends on Saturday days after being criticized for hitting the green minutes after making a speech regarding the ISIS beheading of journalist James Foley . 'Sports and leisure activities are a good way for release and clearing of the mind for a lot of us,' Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters in a makeshift briefing room on Martha's Vineyard, where Obama is on a two-week vacation. But 'I am not going to get into the president's mindset on that,' he added. The president drew fire earlier this week after reacting for just five minutes to Foley's on-camera slaying by Islamist militants linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), and then gripping his driver for five hours. Less than ten minutes before teeing off, he had told a global audience that 'when people harm Americans, anywhere, we do what’s necessary to see that justice is done.' Then he was seen laughing with friends at the Farm Neck Golf Club. A day later he played golf again, although photographs taken Thursday depicted a more somber commander-in-chief recreating. Obama took first lady Michelle Obama hiking on Friday morning. Reporters and photographers were kept far out of range. The fist-bump: Less than ten minutes after delivering heartfelt words about the vicious killing of James Foley, Obama hit the links with friends on Wednesday . Schultz acknowledged Friday the poor 'optics' of playing golf while a decapitated journalist's family mourned, but insisted that 'the president is focused on doing his job,' even while on vacation. 'Just because the president is in a different location doesn't mean he's not doing his job,' Schultz insisted, assuring reporters that domestic and international events have 'absolutely captured the president's attention while we've been here.' Donald Trump, the ubiquitous real estate mogul and golf course owner, told MailOnline that the White House should be taking advantage of Obama's golf outings as a chance to build compromises with Republicans. Golf 'is a perfect game to make friends and negotiate deals over,' he said Friday. But 'the only people Obama should be playing golf with are congressmen – legislators – and especially the opposition.' 'Obama should not be playing golf on the first day of bombings or after an American journalist is beheaded.' A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told MailOnline that to his knowledge, the senior Republican lawmaker had never been invited to play a round with the president. Kerry hasn't been seen in Washington all week, and reporters have been unable to get an answer from the State Department about his location. But Instagram user Judy Durkin posted a photo of a sailboat on Monday that bears the same markings as Kerry's, cruising neat Nantucket – just a few miles from where Obama has been vacationing. Others tweeted Kerry sightings there as recently as Thursday. The Republican National Committee, predictably, was not amused. 'The Obama White House is MIA on the world stage,' RNC Deputy Press Secretary Raffi Williams told MailOnline. 'America’s influence around the world has been waning ever since Obama took office and now that the world is erupting in crises our top diplomat is sailing in Nantucket.' 'Americans want hands on leadership that tackles the tough problems head on. The out of touch leadership seen from Obama and Kerry is going to hurt 2014 Democrats.' The secretary of state's secret vacation plans are no longer a secret, thanks to Twitter . The Straight Wharf restaurant's website includes a menu with no prices, but it's not clear what kind of dinner $1,000 can buy there . The State Department released a statement in Kerry's name on Wednesday, after the Foley video had made most of America cringe. 'We grieve for James Foley. We mourn for his family and his loved ones,' the statement read. 'We honor the courage and pray for the safety of all those who risk their lives to discover the truth where it is needed most.' 'And make no mistake: we will continue to confront ISI[S] wherever it tries to spread its despicable hatred. The world must know that the United States of America will never back down in the face of such evil.' Criticism of the president after he marked his scorecard Wednesday was fast and furious. 'Not only did he insult the Foley family; he sent a message to [ISIS leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and all of the other jihadi terrorist militants – now soldiers of a jihadi army – that he doesn't take it all seriously.' Texas Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert told Mailonline that Obama's detached attitude suggests he hasn't been engaged in the hunt for Foley's murderer. 'Unfortunately for those who want evil ISIS members eliminated before they kill more Americans,' Gohmert said, 'the president spent more time lining up his many putts than he did lining up efforts to stop the killers.' Lou Barletta, a Republican lawmaker from Pennsylvania, told MailOnline that the image of Obama golfing his cares away 'is disheartening, and sends the wrong signals to our enemies. ISIS needs to be stopped, and fist pumps between the president and his buddies won’t stop them.' Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney told Fox News host Sean Hannity that 'every day we find new evidence that he’d rather be on the golf course than he would be dealing with a crisis that’s developing rapidly in the Middle East.' ABC News political director Rick Klein added that 'the president himself clearly doesn't ... care about the way it looks.'

"An IT contractor was accused of racism and refused a £1,000-a-week NHS job after innocently offering to buy an Asian recruitment consultant a bacon sandwich. Clive Hunt, 58, had already been given the eight-month contract – worth £32,000 – and was invited to recruitment firm Reed’s office in Manchester to show his passport and provide bank details. At the end of the 15-minute meeting earlier this month, recruitment consultant Sharika Sacranie, 29, shook Mr Hunt’s hand and said she would come and meet him for breakfast the following week, to which he replied: ‘I’ll get the bacon sandwiches in.’ Clive Hunt, 58, says he was offered the IT job by recruitment firm Reed before a senior manager phoned him to say his offer of a bacon sandwich to a recruiter was racist . Mr Hunt made the comment to Reed recruiter Sharika Sacranie . Miss Sacranie – who is believed to be . a Muslim – rang Mr Hunt half an hour later to confirm a few more . details, making no mention of the incident. However, just ten minutes later Mr . Hunt received another call from a senior manager at Reed accusing him of . making a racist comment and saying the job offer had been withdrawn. Last night, Mr Hunt told The Mail on . Sunday: ‘I just can’t believe it. I’m not a racist and I only offered to . buy her a bacon sandwich because she said she was coming for breakfast. It was an off-the-cuff comment. ‘I was at the top of the stairs ready to leave and Sharika said, “I’ll . buy everybody breakfast either Monday or Tuesday next week.” I turned . around and said, “I’ll get the bacon sandwiches in.” ‘There’s nothing racist about it. There was no slur at her because I’d already met all the contractors on . site before and one of them had actually told me they had really good . bacon sandwiches. 'I don’t even know whether Sharika is a Muslim or not. I’d never met her before that day but we got on fine. ‘When the manager rang me up to . accuse me of making a racist remark, he just kept telling me I should . admit to my wrongdoing. But eventually I got so exasperated that I told . him to “sod off” and put the phone down.’ Clive Hunt says he lost out on a £1,000-a-month NHS contract when a Reed recruiter complained he made a racist remark . He added: ‘I’ve been out of work for . two months so this is a massive blow for me. I was under the impression . that the agency was just a middle man. How can it rescind an offer that . was made to me by the NHS?’ Miss Sacranie could not be reached . for comment yesterday. In a statement, Reed said: ‘Due to inappropriate . comments made to members of our staff during the recruitment process . before Mr Hunt started his new role, we do not feel we can represent . this candidate further.’ An NHS spokesperson was unavailable for comment last night.

"Volcanic eruptions may be behind the slowdown in global warming over the past 15 years, a study claims. US scientists believe small volcanoes are spewing sulphur aerosols into the upper atmosphere that reflect sunlight away from the Earth. Researchers have long known that volcanoes can protect against global warming, but they did not think that minor eruptions did much to the atmosphere. Scroll down for video . The Sarychev Peak Volcano, on Matua Island, erupted on June 12, 2009. New research shows that eruptions of this size may contribute more to the recent lull in global temperature increases than previously thought . The latest findings, by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, show that small volcanic eruptions have deflected almost twice the amount of solar radiation previously estimated. 'By knocking incoming solar energy back out into space, sulphuric acid particles from these recent eruptions could be responsible for decreasing global temperatures by 0.05 to 0.12°C (0.09 to 0.22°F) since 2000,' said the study. 'These new data could help to explain why increases in global temperatures have slowed over the past 15 years, a period dubbed the ""global warming hiatus"".' The warmest year on record was in 1998, and although recent years have been warmer than the 20th century average, the steep climb seen in the 1990s has levelled off. In April, the IPCC said it is '95 per cent' certain that climate change is man made, but still could not explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years. Now researchers claim its due to volcanic eruptions. Pictured is the change in average sea surface temperatures from 1901 - 2012 . A number of theories exist on why the globe is experiencing a warming hiatus, including changes in the way heat is absorbed by the ocean or a period of weak solar activity. Instead of eruptions, some scientists claim one of the causes of the‘plateau’ in sea-surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water. They believe this exchange is occurring between warm, surface waters and cold, deep waters below 2,300ft (700 metres) – as if the warming is ‘hiding’ underwater. Easterly trade winds of the Pacific Ocean have increased significantly over the past two decades and as a result are blowing higher volumes of warm surface sea water to deeper depths. Stronger trade winds blowing from South America to Australia have had the net effect of cooling surface temperatures by a global average of between 0.1°C and 0.2°C, . This would be enough to account for the apparent hiatus in global average temperatures over the past 15 years. The warm water won’t hide below the surface forever: scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators, such as sea level or ocean circulation. But most climate projections do not factor in volcanic eruptions because they are so hard to predict. However, large ones like the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines, which emitted some 44 billion lbs (20 million metric tons) of sulphur, are believed to have impacted global climate. David Ridley, an atmospheric scientist at MIT in Cambridge, felt that a piece of the climate puzzle was missing. According to the study, he located it in the intersection of the stratosphere and the troposphere - the bottom layer of the atmosphere- where all weather takes place. The two layers meet between six to nine miles (10 and 15km) above the Earth, and are below the reach of most satellites. 'The satellite data does a great job of monitoring the particles above nine miles (15km), which is fine in the tropics,' Professor Ridley said. 'However, towards the poles we are missing more and more of the particles residing in the lower stratosphere that can reach down to six miles (10km).' The study combined observations from ground, air and space-based instruments to better observe aerosols in the lower portion of the stratosphere, and found that there are more aerosols that previously thought. Experts say future climate models need to incorporate better aerosol data, which can only be obtained with a more robust monitoring system for stratospheric aerosols. The latest findings, by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, show that small volcanic eruptions have deflected almost twice the amount of solar radiation previously estimated.

"President Barack Obama leveled a new round of sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, responding to President Vladimir Putin's refusal to back down from his military interventions in eastern Ukraine. Obama told reporters at the White House that Russia is 'isolating itself from the international community, setting back decades of genuine process.' 'Russia is once again isolating itself from the international community, setting back decades of progress,' he said minutes later. 'It doesn't have to be this way. This is a choice that Russia and President Putin in particular have made.' Obama said he doesn't see his administration's several rounds of economic sanctions against Moscow as a new 1980s-style standoff. 'No, it's not a new Cold War,' the president said, responding to a question from CBS News. 'The United States means what it says': Obama spoke on the South Lawn of the White House on Tuesday, announcing new economic sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy in the latest move to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his support for Ukrainian rebels . 'Russia continues to support the separatists ... and train them, and arm them,' he said, adding that American satellite surveillance has documented Russian forces launching artillery strikes directly into Ukraine. 'Today is a reminder that the United States means what it says.' The sanctions include a wide range of targeted moves aimed at banks, defense contractors and Putin 'cronies and oligarchs,' a senior administration official said Tuesday. And 'today we have expanded the list of financial institutions' under sanctions 'to include three additional major Russia-owned banks.' 'There need to be greater costs imposed on Russia,' the official said, in response to 'the flow of heavy weapons and support we've seen from Russia into Ukraine in the last couple of weeks.' Russia is backing the separatist movement whose soldiers shot down a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet last week. Obama complained that Putin's government has blocked international inspectors from viewing the entirety of the crash scene. The U.S. president devoted most of his 10 minutes of remarks to underscoring his administration's hope that Putin will buckle under the weight of financial penalties, and withdraw from Ukraine. 'The main tool that we have to influence Russian behavior ... is the impact they're having on its economy,' he said. Obama dodged a reporter's question, however, about whether the U.S. will step in and arm the Ukrainian government. 'Are you considering lethal aide to Ukraine?' came the question. 'The issue is not the ability of the Ukrainian military to outfight the separatists,' Obama replied. He also noted a new round of sanctions from the European Union, calculated to emphasize Europe's preference for Ukraine over Putin's Russia. Standing alone? Russian President Vladimir Putin has maed his nation 'more isolated than at any time since the end of the Cold War,' a senior Obama administration official told reporters on Tuesday . Those sanctions, announced hours before Obama spoke in Washington, include limits on capital market access for Russian state banks, an arms trade embargo and restrictions on the export of sensitive technologies to Russian oil companies – including foreign companies engaged in Russia's petroleum markets. Obama's announcement came in conjunction with a series of EU sanctions targeting banks, defense contractors and the oil industry in Russia . 'It is meant as a strong warning,' a statement from the European Council read: 'Illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country cannot be accepted in 21st century Europe.' Obama highlighted the degree to which Russia's annexation of the Crimea, and its continued arming of rebels there, has exposed Putin to consequences all across Europe. 'It's hard to avoid the spillover of what's happening in eastern Ukraine from affecting Europeans across the board,' Obama said. A second senior administration official said after the president boarded Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House that 'the European Union's steps are strong, they are significant, and they represent a new step for Europe .... that we have taken together,' 'That is very similar to what we have done.' 'Russia is not a very good bet right now for international investors,' added a third official. Asked what the administration expected Putin to do, he rattled off a list of expectations. 'There still is an off-ramp available to Russia and President Putin,' the official told reporters during a conference call. That would require Moscow to recognize the legitimacy of Ukraine's newly elected government, stop the flow of arms across the Russia-Ukraine border, abandon its troop buildup there, and persuade rebels to enter a diplomatic dialogue. 'We will continue to hold that door open,' he said.","Economic penalties will hit state-owned banks, Putin 'cronies and oligarchs,' defense contractors and Russia's oil industry .

His hands now measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the tip of his middle finger and weigh two stone . The eight-year-old claims he is bullied because of his giant hands and has difficulty performing simple tasks . The cricket fan said he has been bullied and shunned most of his life because others are 'scared' of his deformity. He said: 'I do not go to school because the teacher says other kids are scared of my hands. 'Many of them used to bully me for my deformity. They would say ""let's beat up the kid with the large hands"". 'Some of them have actually beaten me and would go after me often. 'I find it difficult to put on my clothes, button my shirt and pull up my pants. 'But I don't know if I want doctors to operate on my hands. They would have to make me unconscious and then they would cut me open. 'I have no problem if they could do it without an injection. A small operation would be okay.' His parents, who earn just £15 a month, have been desperately trying to find help for their son - but to no avail. His mother Haleema, 27, (pictured with Kaleem and another one of her children) said she feels 'powerless' Kaleem, a keen cricketer, said the teachers at his school have told him other children are 'scared' of his hands . He has found it difficulty to play cricket and hold a bat due to his condition but tries to still join in with his friends . His mother, who has other children who do not suffer from the same condition, said: 'When Kaleem was born his hand was twice the size of a normal baby's. 'His hands were big and his fingers were long. Initially his fists were small but they began to grow large as well and his fingers also kept growing.' His father, Shamim, 45, who works as a labourer, is worried his son will never be independent and blames himself for not earning enough money. 'He has difficulty feeding himself because his fist does not bend properly - so we have to feed him,' he said. 'Using two fingers he is able to pick up some things like a glass of water to drink. 'We want to take him to the hospital but there have been times when money has been so low that my wife has been forced to go begging. 'In that kind of financial situation, getting treatment for Kaleem was difficult. 'Even when I tried to get Kaleem into the school, the headmaster told me to put in writing that the school would not be responsible if the other children were afraid of his hands or bullied him or laughed at him.' Doctors in India have been left baffled by his growing hands and many are at a loss as to what the condition is . The youngster has difficulty eating, tying his shoelaces and carrying out other basic tasks due to his  hands . Kaleem's father Shamim, 45, (pictured together above) is worried his son will never become independent . The couple have only just been able to take their son to a local doctor for an assessment but their hopes of an instant cure have been dashed. Dr Ratan, the director of the local hospital, said: 'As far as my knowledge goes, this is an extremely rare condition. 'I have not seen a case in medical journals or on the internet where only the hands grew to such a large size. 'Until we have done proper genetic testing we will not be able to say exactly what is causing this deformity.' He said that apart from the unsightly growths, Kaleem is in good health - with properly functioning lungs and heart. Doctors have assessed Kaleem and have described his hands as a 'rare condition'. He is otherwise healthy . Kaleem was born with larger-than-average hands but they have continued to grow throughout his childhood . But as his hands continue to grow it may put increased pressure on his cardiovascular system, potentially shortening his life. Elsewhere, Dr Krishan Chugh, head of paediatrics at the state-of-the-art Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurgaon, near Delhi, has also been left baffled after reviewing photographs and videos of the boy's hands. However, he believes Kaleem may be suffering from either lymphangioma or hamartoma - which are both treatable. He added: 'This condition looks very rare and I have come across something like this before. Without proper examination and medical tests I am not 100 per cent sure about what this is.' Kaleem's parents are now hoping to raise money for their son in the hope that his condition can be treated . One doctor said he believes the Kaleem may be suffering from either lymphangioma - a condition of the lymphatic system causing extreme inflamation - or hamartoma - a benign tumour - both of which are treatable . Lymphangioma is a condition of the lymphatic system which causes extreme inflammation resulting in doughy masses forming in certain parts of the body. Hamartoma is a benign type of tumour where the body produces excess tissue. After hearing from the doctors, Kaleem's parents now have renewed optimism that something can be done for their son and are doubling their efforts to raise money for him. 'We have tried several places with no solutions so far,' said Shamim. 'But I have a feeling there is a way to get the resources to give my son a normal life.'","Kaleem, from India, was born with hands twice the size of an average baby .

"Manuel Pellegrini insists he is not feeling the pressure at Manchester City despite his team’s faltering form and the prospect of finishing this season empty handed. City are understood to be monitoring the progress of Diego Simeone at Atletico Madrid should they decide to make a change and part company with Pellegrini in the summer. The Premier League champions have slipped seven points behind Chelsea in the title race ahead of Wednesday’s trip to Stoke, and have failed to win any of their last five game in all competitions. It represents City’s worst run since late 2009 when current Stoke boss Mark Hughes was sacked at the Etihad. Under-fire Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists he isn't feeling the pressure at the club . James Milner rescued Manuel Pellegrini's side with a late free-kick at the Etihad Stadium . Pellegrini’s future could hinge on how his team perform against Barcelona in the Champions League, but the Chilean remained a picture of calm at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday. He said: ‘I don’t feel any pressure from inside the club or from outside. ‘I never feel pressure. It has been the same the last two years, the only pressure is my own pressure – the pressure I make on myself when I don’t think the team is playing well. ‘We are in a normal position, we’re involved in the Champions League, if we win on Wednesday I think we are just one point less than last season. We have a lot more important things to think about than pressure.’ Pellegrini confirmed that Yaya Toure and new £28million signing Wilfried Bony will arrive back in England later in the week after helping Ivory Coast lift the Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, although City are not involved in the FA Cup this weekend. The champions have failed to win any of the six league games Toure has missed this season – they did beat Bayern Munich and Roma in Europe – but Pellegrini was reluctant to dwell on players who will not be available to him for a difficult test at the Britannia Stadium. Manuel Pellegrini looks on during his side's disappointing 1-1 draw with Hull City on Saturday . Pellegrini says Ivory Coast duo Yaya Toure (left) and Wilfried Bony (right) will return later this week . Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has been lined up as a potential successor for Pellegrini . ‘It is very important to have Yaya back and playing with the team but we don’t just depend on one player,’ he added. ‘It is a very important player but we must win without him. ‘Bony will be a very important player for the squad also but we are not just depending on what Bony can do. We have also Edin Dzeko, we have Jovetic, we have Kun Aguero, we have Silva. We have a lot of players that always score. ‘The players have different moments during the season. If you remember, at the beginning of the season, everyone asked why Yaya continued playing. After that it was a team that was only (relying) on Sergio Aguero and without Sergio Aguero it was impossible to play. When Sergio wasn’t fit, we continue winning all the games. Now he is coming back and all of us are expecting that he will recover his normal performance. ‘Stoke are always a very difficult team, especially playing at the Britannia. It is a difficult team for us because last season we just won here 1-0 and we drew there 0-0 so in every moment it is difficult.’ Sergio Aguero should recover his 'normal performance' soon after injury, according to Pellegrini .","Manchester City drew 1-1 with Hull City in the Premier League on Saturday .

"Royal Navy sailors will never again make their traditional Saturday night toast and drink to ‘Our Wives and Sweethearts.’ The toast, which prompts the response, ‘May they never meet’, has been banned because there are so many women officers serving in the Navy. The seafaring tradition – often made with a tot of rum – has stood for 200 years, but will now be changed so that servicemen and women toast ‘Our families’ instead. Sailors make a toast on a submarine in 1940 but the Royal Navy will no longer be able to drink to 'Our wives and sweethearts', after the Ministry of Defence banned the Saturday night tradition because there are so many women at sea . The instruction was issued by the new Second Sea Lord, Vice Admiral David Steel. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘To reflect cultural changes and our modern and inclusive Navy, two of the naval toasts, used at mess dinners, have been updated. ‘The Royal Navy values the diversity and range of its personnel and it is only right that its traditional toasts should reflect the fact that women have been at sea for over 20 years.’ The other tradition which has changed is that the Tuesday night toast will be made to ‘Our Sailors’ rather than to ‘Our Men’. Admiral Lord Boyce, a former Chief of the Defence Staff, blasted the rule change as 'unnecessary' The custom has been practised since Admiral Nelson’s era but after women first served in service vessels in 1990 it has become increasingly outdated. In 2012, Sarah West became the first female frontline ship’s captain in the frigate HMS Portland. Other time-honoured toasts which follow the toasts to the Queen will remain unchanged. On Mondays, a glass is raised to ‘Our ships at sea’, and on Wednesdays, sailors drink to ‘Ourselves (as no one else is likely to concern themselves with our welfare!)’. On Thursdays they toast to ‘A bloody war or a sickly season’, referring to the better prospects of promotion in wartime in the 19th century and pestilence. ‘A willing enemy and sea room’ is toasted on Fridays, referring to the reluctance of other navies to face the British, and on Sundays they drink to ‘absent friends’. The change to tradition was not well received by some former sailors. Former Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Lord Boyce said: ‘In my view this is an unnecessary genuflection in the name of PC-manship and I have no intention of following it. ‘It’s broken with tradition unnecessarily. He told The Times: ‘Are we to await new orders telling us to “person the ship” or “person the sides”?’","The Saturday night tradition has been scrapped by the Ministry of Defence .

"Pedro Bravo, 20, stands accused of killing roommate Christian Aguilar in September 2012. He is pictured during his trial Alachua County Criminal Justice Centre in Florida . A college student accused of killing his roommate asked Siri for advice on hiding a body the day the man went missing, according to U.S. police. Pedro Bravo, 20, stands accused of kidnapping and strangling his friend Christian Aguilar, 18, in September 2012 when they shared a room at the University of Florida. The murder trial at the Alachua County Criminal Justice Centre, Florida, yesterday heard how the men had argued over Aguilar dating Bravo's ex-girlfriend, Erika Friman. Detective Matt Goeckel from Gainesville Police Department said on 20 September 2012, Bravo told Apple's digital assistant Siri: 'I need to hide my roommate'. In response to this, Siri said: 'What kind of place are you looking for? Swamps. Reservoirs. Metal foundries. Dumps.' Bravo was charged with murder on Friday 28 September 2012. But his friend's body was not found until weeks later when hunters stumbled across Aguilar in a shallow grave in a Levy County forest, about 60 miles southwest of Gainesville. Evidence collected from Bravo's iPhone also includes records of him using the phone's flashlight function nine times from 11.31pm to 12.01am on the day that Bravo disappeared. Police have said Bravo was using the phone's flashlight function to hide the body in the woods. They also say that location data gathered from the smartphone does not fit with Bravo's account of his movements that evening. Scroll down for video .

He is accused of drugging and strangling his former inside his SUV in a Walmart parking lot then partially burying his body  in very remote wooded area. Detective Goeckel, a forensic expert, dissected cell phone data from both men and said it appears both phones were at the Walmart.

Bravo used to date Miss Friman, but she broke the relationship off before she moved to Gainesville to attend Santa Fe College. She then began dating Aguilar, who she met in Miami. Medical Examiner Dr Martha Burt said, 'I've ruled out natural death, suicide and accidental' in the case. If you ask Siri how to hide a body today she won't answer in the same way. She simply says: 'I used to know the answer to this'. This quirk in Apple's iOS Voice Assistant was widely reported in the tech media shortly after Siri's launch.

"Never mind Long Ball United, now it’s Long Face United. Louis van Gaal’s stars have failed to live up to expectations and don’t even look as though they are enjoying their football under the Dutchman. That’s the damning assessment from Preston’s veteran striker Kevin Davies who has vowed to target Manchester United’s soft centre in defence when the two clubs meet in the FA Cup fifth round at Deepdale on Monday night. Van Gaal warned his players after Wednesday night’s unimpressive Premier League win over Burnley that United will go out of the cup if they play as badly again against their League One opponents. Kevin Davies does not believe all is well under Louis van Gaal at Manchester United . Davies trains with Preston North End team-mates ahead of their FA Cup clash with United . The former Bolton striker claims that United's star players do not look like they are enjoying their football . And Davies, who faced United in their pomp on numerous occasions for Bolton, believes they are still way short of their best despite investing more than £150million on new players last summer. United fans are growing increasingly critical of the style of play under Van Gaal, and Davies detects that the players are less than happy with the new regime as well. He said: ‘Just looking at one or two of the players. Van Persie scoring last night, there was no real smile and he didn’t look particularly happy. Wayne Rooney playing a bit deeper, it’s probably different to what those players are used to. ‘Players don’t particularly like change anyway, but a new manager comes in with new ways and are they enjoying it as much as they used to? I don’t get that impression from the players that they are. ‘When you lose someone like Sir Alex Ferguson it’s always going to take time. Players have to adjust to a different regime. You are doing double sessions when you maybe are not used to doing that kind of thing. Is the training more tactical? Is it more five-a-sides? These things can take an effect. Paul Gallagher (centre) controls the ball during a training session at Springfields Training Centre . Scott Laird (centre) dribbles the ball as the League One side look to pull off a massive FA Cup upset . Louis van Gaal's expensively assembled side have failed to live up to expectations . ‘Burnley caused them no end of problems. On paper, the squad they have and the money they’ve spent, they are fantastic players but I don’t think they’re quite living up to those expectations. ‘The fans are a bit frustrated with the style of play. They’re not exciting as they used to be but the club has had big change. ‘They’re dividing opinion. I’ve got quite a few friends who were at the game last night and are pleased to be back in among the Champions League places but there are a few boos about long balls and the style of play has not been great. ‘This year they have got a bit of resilience about them. Not playing and winning games, you have to have. I think he (Van Gaal) has not quite had the settled side. There are always injuries and a couple limped out last night. I don’t think he’s quite found the right system.’ Davies, 37, claimed that United’s main weakness lies in central defence and believes that Van Gaal’s side would not be in third were it not for goalkeeper David de Gea. Despite a 3-1 victory, United were tested by struggling Burnley in their last Premier League game . Manchester United players can appear unfamiliar with what Van Gaal requires of them . ‘You have to identify that as their weakness,’ he added. ‘That’s what I certainly feel. When you consider that David de Gea has been their best player this season – something I don’t think anyone can argue with – he’s not been that well protected and without him they wouldn’t be in those top-four positions, I don’t think there is any question about that. ‘And that suggests they have not had a settled back-three or back-five at times because of injuries. Whether he would have picked the same team anyway what with squad rotation you don’t know. ‘But I think defence is an area they will need to improve if they get back into the Champions League and start challenging again for the Premier League title. ‘With Chelsea being so strong and Manchester City also being ahead of them, that is an area of the pitch that they need to improve in the summer I think. I really think the squad needs an overhaul and he has started to do that. ‘But he is not going to be able to do it in one or two windows. It will take three or four. I think he will get it right. We will see Manchester United over the next six or 12 months get better and better and play a better style of football.’ Davies has faced Manchester United on numerous occasions during his time in the Premier League . Preston manager Simon Grayson (centre) speaks to his players during the training session . Davies (left) and Gallagher are put through their paces ahead of their FA Cup clash on Monday . Davies claims that Preston will be looking to exploit Manchester United's weaknesses in defence . Asked about the claims by his old Bolton boss Sam Allardyce that United had played long-ball football against West Ham last week, and Van Gaal’s bizarre response in producing statistical evidence to the contrary, Davies couldn’t help but smile. ‘Sam was obviously having a little sly dig,’ he said. ‘That’s Sam. He did it to Jose Mourinho last year and got the better of him as well. ‘I think the response from Van Gaal surprised a few. We’ll be looking to defend the ‘long sideways passes’ a bit better, so we’ve been working on that!’ Davies blames United’s withdrawal from the FA Cup in 1999 for helping to dent the attraction of the old competition in the eyes of some people, but insists that it still remains the most important trophy for him. Goalkeeper David de Gea has been United's stand-out performer this season . Radamel Falcao is reportedly unhappy at not playing full games under Van Gaal . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has criticised United for using long-ball tactics . It is also Van Gaal’s best hope of silverware in his first season in English football, and Davies – who reached the final with Southampton and semis with Chesterfield and Bolton – has promised to give the Dutchman a run for his money on Monday. ‘The cup has had a lot of criticism in recent years,’ he said. ‘Probably since Manchester United didn’t enter the competition it’s gone down in the pecking order. ‘But, for me, I’d rather win that over the Champions League any day. I’m an Englishman and my memories growing up watching those finals and playing professionally and getting close. We go into this game looking to cause an upset. ‘Van Gaal says himself they are one of the favourites now for this trophy and we’ve got to make it as hard as possible for them. They would obviously like to get their hands on the FA Cup but hopefully we will have a say in that. ‘We saw how much trouble Burnley gave them the other night and we are capable of doing that. We can look back at their games against Yeovil and Cambridge and take note. It’s another tricky game for them. ‘We can hurt them going forward and we have got defenders who are willing to defend hard and put their bodies on the line. Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie, Di Maria, Mata, there are so many players and it’s exciting to come up against them and test ourselves.’","Manchester United face Preston North End in FA Cup fifth round .

"Crystal Palace have been told to match Blackburn Rovers’ £5million valuation of Rudy Gestede or forget about signing the striker in the January transfer window. The Premier League club are offering £3.5m for Gestede, but Blackburn have warned that their refusal to accept Hull City’s £10m bid for his strike partner Jordan Rhodes in the summer is proof that they will not be forced into a cut-price deal. Manager Gary Bowyer said: ‘I think the owners have a valuation and until it’s met I don’t think he’ll be going anywhere. They proved that this season with Jordan Rhodes. Blackburn Rovers striker Rudy Gestede sat out his side's draw with Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium . The forward is attempting to push through a deal with Premier League club Crystal Palace . ‘The conversation has been quite simple really: any offers that come into the club have to go to the owners and they will make the decision. We are no under no instruction to sell but we have to take any offers to them. ‘Obviously there’s been no deal done so in terms of both parties I think they are haggling over what’s the right figure for him.’ Although Gestede was said to have missed last weekend’s game against Wigan Athletic because he was not in the right frame of mind, Bowyer insists the 26-year-old Benin striker was left out because Blackburn thought a deal was close. And he warned Palace that the player will be in his squad to face Swansea City in the FA Cup on Saturday. ‘There’s been no question about the player’s frame of mind at all,’ he added. ‘If you’d seen him this morning throwing himself around in training, he’s in a good place. He’s a good person. He just carries on with his job. Gestede (left) has bagged 24 goals in 43 league appearances for the Championship side . ‘We thought it might have progressed quicker than it did and that’s why he wasn’ t involved (against Wigan). There have been no further developments so he goes into the squad for Saturday. Unless anything changes before then he is looking at focussing on being involved against Swansea. ‘He’s conducted himself in a brilliant way. It’s not his fault people have not met the valuation put on him by our owners. All he can do is concentrate on getting ready for the game.’ Bowyer gave a mischievous response to comments from Gestede’s agent David Wancier that ‘the player really wants to sign for Crystal Palace but is also committed to Blackburn’. The Rovers boss said: ‘It would be interesting if another Premier League club came in. There’s nobody at the moment, but that might make his agent think. ‘You’d have to take it up with him, I can only speak on Rudy’s behalf and how he’s been. He has been fine with us and is committed to playing on Saturday. ‘His relationship with our supporters is fantastic and I’m sure on Saturday they’ll be chanting his name. There is no question of Rudy not giving 100 per cent, that’s the type of lad he is.’ Gestede celebrates scoring the equaliser for Blackburn against Middlesbrough in November .","Rudy Gestede is a transfer target for Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew .

"A report from a French physician in 1740 contains what is thought to be the oldest medical record of a near-death experience has been discovered. The discovery was made by anthropologist Dr Phillipe Charlier, who bought the book for about $1 (60p) in an antique shop. In the book a patient is being described as falling unconscious and then seeing a pure bright light that they interpreted as being Heaven. A French medical record from 1740 (shown) was found to include the oldest known reference to a near-death experience (NDE) in a patient. The book was written by military physician Pierre-Jean du Monchaux. He describes how his patient had vivid sensations associated with NDEs . The Greyson criteria measures how strong of a near-death experience a person has had. Dr Charlier applied it to the patient in the book (each part scored out of two). A score of seven or higher is said to be an NDE. Altered sense of time 1/2 . Accelerated thought processes 0/2 . Life review 0/2 . Sense of sudden understanding 0/2 . Affective feeling of peace 2/2 . Feeling of joy 2/2 . Feeling of cosmic unity 0/2 . Seeing/feeling surrounded by light 2/2 . Purportedly paranormal vivid senses 0/2 . Purported extrasensory perception 1/2 . Purported precognitive vision 0/2 . Sense of being out of physical body 0/2 . Apparent transcendental sense of an ‘other world’ environment 2/2 . Sense of a mystical entity 2/2 . Sense of deceased/religious spirits 0/2 . Sense of a border/’point of no return’ 0/2 . Total score 12/32 . Titled ‘Anecdotes de Médecine’, the report was written by French military physician Pierre-Jean du Monchaux, reports LiveScience. At the time Monchaux attempted to explain the phenomenon by saying that an increase in blood flow to the brain could be the cause behind the visions. However, modern physicians now think that the odd sensations are actually caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. ‘Near-death experience (NDE) has been scientifically described as “a profound psychological event with transcendental and mystical elements” after a life-threatening crisis,’ Dr Charlier writes in his paper. He describes these elements as awareness of being dead, positive emotions, out of body experience, the feeling of moving through a tunnel, communication with light, observation of colours of a celestial landscape, meeting with deceased people and a life review. Pierre-Jean du Monchaux was born in 1733 but died in 1766 at the age of just 33 in the island San Domingo from a fever. His patient for this report was a Parisian apothecary who had a malign fever. After his last blood test he fell unconscious for a long time, to such an extent that his assistant became worried. ‘He reported that after having lost all external sensations, he saw such a pure and extreme light that he thought he was in Heaven (literally: in the Kingdom of the Blessed),’ writes Dr Charlier. ‘He remembered this sensation very well, and affirmed that never of all his life had he had a nicer moment. ‘Other individuals of various ages and sexes reported a very similar sensation in the same circumstances.’ Monchaux then compared this case with others caused by drowning, hypothermia and hanging, and deduced that all involved the loss of blood. He then writes that the abundant flow of blood back into the brain creates ‘these vivid and strong sensations’. During NDEs people describe having vivid sensations that seem to suggest they are moving towards a light (stock image shown) accompanied by a pleasant sensation. Monchaux thought it was caused by an increase in blood flow to the brain But modern scientist now think it is actually caused by a lack of oxygen . Today opinion is divided on the true cause of NDEs. During such an event people describe having vivid sensations, sometimes out-of-body, that seem to suggest they are moving towards a light accompanied by a pleasant sensation. Some experts think it is caused by a lack of blood to the brain, which sets it into ‘panic mode’ and it produces vivid visions as it fights to survive. A study of heart attack patients by Southampton University, however, contradicted the notion that lack of oxygen is responsible for NDEs. The research team studied 63 survivors of a cardiac arrest who were resuscitated at Southampton General Hospital after they had been clinically dead with no pulse, no respiration and fixed dilated pupils. And those who reported to have a true NDE during the ordeal were actually found to have had higher oxygen levels than those who hadn’t.","A French medical record from Paris in 1740 was found to include the oldest known reference to a near-death experience (NDE) in a patient .

"Australian schoolies in Bali are being warned that they are at risk, with Balinese nightclubs and bars targeting teen by selling a potentially lethal alcohol at bargain prices. Nightclubs in Kuta and Seminyak are serving dangerous alcohol 'arak' at extremely low prices, despite the fact the alcohol has been know to poison consumers in the past, leading to blindness, organ failure and death. One bar has a deal for '20 shots for under $15' and Red Bull and Vodka drinks for $1.50, according to The Daily Telegraph. But travellers are being warned not to be tempted by these deals, to avoid drinking spirits and to stick to bottled beverages for the sake of their safety. Scroll down for video . About 6,000 Australians are expected to head to Bali in the next three weeks for schoolies celebrations . Australian casualties have been amongst the deaths and injuries that have occurred due to methanol poisoning in Indonesia. Perth rugby player Michael Denton, left, died after drinking a cocktail in 2011 and and teenager Liam Davies, right, died of suspected methanol poisoning on New Year's Day 2013. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Medical Association warn against the consumption of arak. Not only can it contain up to 50% alcohol, if arak is incorrectly brewed methanol is often created, resulting in a potentially deadly liquid. Australian casualties have been amongst the deaths and injuries that have occurred due to methanol poisoning in Indonesia. Perth teenager Liam Davies, 19, died in Indonesia of suspected methanol poisoning on New Year's Day 2013. In 2011, Perth rugby player Michael Denton died of methanol poisoning after drinking a cocktail. In two separate occasions in December 2013, Central Coast teen Jasmine Baker, 17, and Perth teen Tess Mettam, 19, both went temporarily blind after drinking cocktails in Bali, again due to methanol poisoning. Red Frogs Australia Bali co-ordinator Paul Mergard said the organisation had dealt with seven suspected cases of methanol poisoning in Bali last year. The substance is mixed in with drinks to be a cheaper alternative to drinkable alcohol like vodka. 'If a price of drink is too good to be true then it probably is,' Mr Mergard said. 'Think about where you’re drinking and what you're drinking. 'Last year we had to airlift one girl to Darwin because she had been poisoned.' In 2009, 29 people died of suspected methanol poisoning in Lombok and surrounding Indonesian islands. Major pitfalls graduates should avoid are methanol poisoning and taking illegal drugs, like hallucinogenic mushrooms . School leavers travelling in Bali are warned that the locally-made alcohol, which is frequently brewed in private homes, is extremely strong, leading to a multitude of increased risks. It's advised that travellers avoid spirits and drink bottled beverages, so they are able to ascertain the strength of the drink and where it was made. With 6,000 Australians expected to land on the shores of party island Bali in the next three weeks, a schoolies support group is warning graduates to take more precautions as the risks of running into trouble overseas is higher than at home. Thirty-four volunteers from Red Frogs Australia will be stationed at up to 20 hotels across Kuta, Legian and Seminyak to help reduce these risks. They will be helping school leavers avoid the pitfalls of schoolies in Bali, which include methanol poisoning and taking illegal drugs, like hallucinogenic mushrooms. Bali co-ordinator Paul Mergard said Red Frogs decided to set up at the popular holiday destination three years ago when the numbers of school leavers heading to the island increased. There will also be volunteers stationed in Fiji. Mr Mergard said the risks of young people running into trouble in Bali was higher than it was for those who opted to stay in Australia for celebrations. 'There is a phenomena that happens in Australians who get on a six-hour flight to Bali where they lose... their common sense,' Mr Mergard told Daily Mail Australia. 'Aussies who get to Bali would do things here they would never do at home, like hire a motorbike without a licence... and they wonder why they get into accidents. 'Traffic gridlock makes getting medical services more challenging.' Last year, Red Frogs Australia dealt with seven cases of suspected methanol poisoning. The substance is used as an alcohol substitute . Mr Mergard said he and the volunteers had seen the 'horrific' effects drugs and alcohol had on people who decided to party too hard. 'A lot of the kids are here to have a good time, but you obviously see a lot of kids intoxicated and have tried mushrooms. 'They're hallucinogenic... people think they can fly and all that sort of stuff, and you can seriously injure yourself. 'They can have significant and long-lasting effects, and people also get violent, aggressive and paranoid. 'Mushrooms have been made illegal in Bali and the penalties could be severe. 'Methanol poisoning is a problem in Bali as well.' Fighting was also another issue and Mr Mergard warned people to behave themselves as a lot of toolies came to Bali and try to pick fights. 'Schoolies need to be aware of that and not to make comments about people's girlfriends... as there are boys who are pumped up and ready to biff,' he said. Mr Mergard urged those travelling overseas to register with the federal government's Smart Traveller website and get travel insurance. He said people without it who break their leg or get sick could face medical costs between $60,000 to $70,000. More than 30 Red Frogs Australia volunteers will be in Bali to help schoolies stay out of trouble .","Australian Schoolies warned about dangerous alcohol 'arak' in Bali bars .

"A nightclub has been condemned for tweeting a photo of a 'legless' semi-naked woman sprawled out next to empty bottles. Liquid Nightclub, in Windsor, Berkshire, posted the picture with the caption 'Want to end up like her? We're giving away a free booth to groups of girls this friday. DM [direct message] us #Mortal.' The image shows a seemingly unconscious woman wearing just a thong and sprawled out on her front surrounded by drink bottles. Scroll down for video . Liquid Nightclub in Windsor, Berkshire has been condemned for posting a tweet featuring a semi-naked 'legless' woman . The tweet asked revellers whether they wanted to 'end up' like the woman pictured seemingly unconscious and surrounded by empty bottles . The promotion offers a 'free booth' to a group of girls and urges people to apply by sending a direct message. The nightclub, which says it removed the post within 40 minutes, has apologised 'unreservedly'. But the tweet has sparked anger among local councillors. David Hilton, Conservative member for Ascot, who is chairman of the council's crime and disorder overview and scrutiny panel, said: 'This photograph is totally alien to what the council may argue is responsible advertising or promoting responsible drinking. 'Getting legless, as this young lady appears to be, is exactly what we want to prevent because it leads to the worst kinds of crime and disorder, and young ladies getting in this state puts them at enormous personal risk.' The town's night-time antics, and how to police it, has become a regular feature on Royal Borough of Windsor council agendas in recent months. Members have pressed for changes to the Licensing Act 2003 to give local authorities more flexibility in dealing with anti-social behaviour. The club's website says booths are available for ten people for a total price of £30. The nightclub, pictured, has apologised 'unreservedly' and says  it removed its tweet within 40 minutes . Tickets for entry to its Friday 'Audio Junk' night are on sale on the website. Today it tweeted about a which advertises £2.50 offers on some drinks and cocktails from £4.25. A spokesman from Liquid said: 'We apologise unreservedly for any offence caused. Liquid Windsor is a responsible operator and does not condone or promote irresponsible drinking. 'The post was unauthorised and against company policy, and it was removed within 40 minutes. 'A disciplinary investigation is now underway and we will be reviewing our social media procedures to ensure this doesn't happen again.' It comes after an academic report warned that a culture of heavy drinking was leading to sexual molestation becoming the norm on a night out for young women. In a disturbing insight into how 18 to 24-year-olds behave on a night out, the survey found one in three girls received inappropriate or unwanted physical attention or groping, but few were surprised. Academics said that excessive consumption of alcohol had turned Britain’s pubs and clubs into a ‘permissive social arena’. The findings were revealed in a report for the charity Drinkaware, which urged women to stop tolerating behaviour which would be considered unacceptable when sober.","Liquid Nightclub in Windsor, Berkshire posted tweet to promote a club night .

"There are houses for cold climates, designed to keep in the heat, and there are homes for hot climates, built to allow air to sweep through and keep its owners cool - but never did the two meet, until now. A pair of London architects has designed an incredible 'folding' house that shapeshifts into eight different configurations and automatically adapts to the changing seasons. Called D*Dynamic, the structure was inspired by the work of an early 20th Century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle. Scroll down for video . Called D*Dynamic, the structure (pictured) was inspired by the work of an early 20th Century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle. The 'folding' house shapeshifts into eight different configurations that automatically adapt to the changing seasons . For example, in the summer, bedroom one faces east and tracks the sunrise using a series of sensors. As the owner wakes up, the house automatically rotates to ensure they are constantly bathed in sunlight, while the house generates energy through its solar panels. In winter, the house is in a square formation, with small windows and high thermal mass, which the designers describe as 'literally hugging itself.' As the seasons change and climate warms, the house opens up, 'like a flower' to allow light and air to penetrate the inside of the building creating panoramic views of the surroundings. The house is the brainchild of architects David Grunberg and Daniel Woolfson, who launched the D*Haus company to develop the concept. The architects said the house will cost £2 million ($3.1 million), but if they are able to produce in in bulk, this could drop the price to £800,000 ($1.2 million). 'D*Dynamic literally unfolds itself,' said the designers. 'The internal walls become external walls, doors become windows and windows become doors. 'A house like this has never been done before in the history of architecture and we believe that creating buildings that can adapt and change is a much more sustainable way of living.' As the owner wakes up, the house automatically rotates to make sure they are constantly in sunlight, while the house generates energy through its solar panels. During  winter, the house is in a square formation, with small windows and high thermal mass, which the designers describe as 'literally hugging itself'. Swipe the yellow bar above to see the house transform . The layout consists of two bedrooms, an open-plan living room and a bathroom, but it can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations. Aside from moving to provide more light, or expand the view, the house is also designed to save money on heating, and prevent energy waste . The largest part of the house would remain stationary with solid foundations, and this is the plumbing, electrics and services would be built. Each of the component parts of house would be sealed from the elements to keep the internal spaces weatherproof, and when the modules link together a sealed connection similar to a car door would allow transition from one space to another. Mr Woolfson told MaiIOnline the team is currently working on a design for the first D*Haus in Cambridgeshire, and is hoping to submit planning permission early next year. The layout consists of two bedrooms, an open-plan living room and a bathroom, but it can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations. Aside from moving to provide more light, or expand the view, the house is also designed to save money on heating, and prevent energy waste. As the designers explained: 'Solar radiation from the sun can have a significant impact on a buildings performance. 'Whilst often a source of overheating due to inadequate controls, with thoughtful design it can provide a cheap and abundant source of energy in your building. The design of the moving house was inspired by the work of English mathematician Henry Dudeney. In 1908, Mr Dudeney worked out how to turn a square into an equilateral triangle. Called the Haberdasher's Puzzle, each of the pieces are hinged and form a chain that can be transformed into the square, or the original triangle (GIF pictured right). Mr Dudeney specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games, and regularly submitted puzzles to newspaper and magazines under the pseudonym 'Sphinx'. Dudeney revealed a model of the solution, made of mahogany with brass hinges, at a meeting of the Royal Society on May 17, 1905. He also published the first known crossnumber puzzle in 1926 and has been credited with inventing verbal arithmetic and discovering new applications of digital roots. The designers said: '[The Haberdasher's Puzzle concept] alone is fascinating and the possibilities are endless when applying the formula to world of architecture and design.' Based on this design, in the summer, bedroom one of the D*Dynamic house faces east and watches the sun rise as its owner wakes up. It can then rotate so that the user is constantly in sunlight, while the house generates energy through its solar panels. During  winter, the house is in a square formation, with small windows and high thermal mass, which the designers describe as 'literally hugging itself.' As the seasons change and climate warms, the house opens up, 'like a flower opens up' to allow light and air to penetrate the inside of the building creating panoramic views of the surroundings. The internal walls become external walls, doors become windows and windows become doors. 'This energy can be utilised to heat spaces in winter, provide hot water, and even generate ventilation for cooling in summer.' 'Conceived for the harsh, climatic extremes from 'Lapland to Cape Horn and Aleutians to Auckland' The D*Haus concept can respond dynamically to its environment by controlled adaptation to seasonal, meteorological and astronomical conditions,' continued Mr Grunberg and Mr Woolfson. 'The flexibility of the D*Haus allows adaptation from winter to summer, and day to night by literally moving inside itself. 'The thick heavy external walls unfold into internal walls allowing glass internal walls to become facades. Doors become windows and vice versa.' The shape-shifting home was first conceived as part of Mr Grunberg's graduation project, for which he designed a house that could withstand the extreme sub-Arctic temperatures in Lap Land. The pair's design is based on the work of English author and mathematician Henry Dudeney, a leading puzzle creator. In 1903 Dudeney invented a way to cut an equilateral triangle into four pieces that could be rearranged into a square, a conundrum he dubbed the Haberdasher's Puzzle. The architects said the house (pictured) will cost £2 million ($3.1 million), but if they are able to produce in in bulk, this could drop the price to £800,000 ($1.2 million). They said: 'A house like this has never been done before in the history of architecture and we believe that creating buildings that can adapt and change is a much more sustainable way of living' In the puzzle, each of the pieces are hinged and form a chain that can be transformed into the square, or the original triangle. Mr Dudeney specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games, and regularly submitted puzzles to newspaper and magazines under the pseudonym 'Sphinx'. In a release, D*Haus described their house concept, as 'a product of an applied mathematical realisation'. 'The D*Haus Company is set to cause a revolution in architecture and design by transforming Dudeney’s idea from the conceptual, to the physical,' the release adds. 'Inspired by Dudeney’s logic puzzle, each D*Haus dwelling is capable of adapting to changing patterns of living in the future. 'D*Haus is continuing the journey that Dudeney began by breathing new life into a century-old concept; not only to define a space, but a lifestyle.'","The D*Haus Architect concept 'metamorphosizes' into eight different configurations based around a series of hinges .

"A Miami woman called Isis Martinez posted a video on YouTube in which she pleads with the media to please stop using her name to refer to the 'shameless excuses for human beings' who have misappropriated her appellation. The 38-year-old, who heads a non-profit in the Florida city, has created a petition urging the media and others to use the acronym 'ISIL' instead of 'ISIS' to describe the group formerly known as Islamic State of Iraq the Levant. The petition, part of a campaign that began on August 23, has so far received 352 signatures. Scroll down for video . Isis Martinez, who has been spearheading a campaign to convince media to stop using the word ISIS to describe the terrorist group occupying large parts of Iraq and Syria, is pictured here with Spanish Journalist Pedro Sevcec . Isis Martinez said she's tired of the 'awkward looks' and negative reactions of people when she introduces herself . 'I couldn't just sit back and let it happen,' she said in an interview with Newsweek. She points out in the video that the United States government uses ISIL - including President Barack Obama - to refer to the group that now calls itself simply  the Islamic State, as do the UN and the Associated Press. 'The past several weeks have been overwhelming' as she's seen her name over and over again in print, Martinez said on the video. 'People's reactions aren't improving at all and i'm getting all sorts of looks.' Since starting her campaign, which now involves running a Facebook group and posting messages to Twitter, Martinez says many other women named Isis have come forward to share their own anecdotes, Newsweek reported. Some women said others ask if Isis is their real name, while others said their children with the appellation are bullied in school. 'People just cringe,' Martinez says, describing the reaction when she introduces herself. Why not just use her middle name, Theresa, instead? 'If I go by a nickname or a middle name, the terrorists win,' she says flatly. Martinez said that she was named after her mother, whose parents got Isis from the Egyptian goddess of health, marriage and love. 'I will not and cannot change my name and neither should the thousands of others who share this beautiful name,' she said.

"Sticker shock is around the corner for many Americans with government-brokered medical coverage, as insurance companies are beginning to apply their first-year costs to next year's premiums. In the case of Florida, some consumers will pay as much as 23 per cent more when their plans are renewed in the fall, according to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. When that agency released its projections on Monday, 23 per cent was the upper end of the bad news. But some consumers in the Sunshine State could see their premiums drop by 5 per cent instead. That's because many insurance companies have been controlling costs by limiting the number of doctors, hospitals and prescription drugs their plans will cover in 2015. Who so serious? President Obama signed a bill on Tuesday funding Israel's Iron Dome defense shield as news emerged that his Obamacare program is getting more expensive for consumers . The average in Florida will come out to a 13.2 per cent hike. The numbers in virtually every state are all across the board, with the biggest rate hikes announced to date coming in states where the federal government runs the Obamacare marketplaces. States like California, which runs its own exchange, appear to be escaping with more modest increases for 2015. Its regulators have announced a 4.2 per cent 'weighted average' hike. That percentage itself could be hiding a spread of rate increases and decreases similar to Florida's. Covered California, the state's Obamacare exchange, said on July 31 that 13 per cent of the state's consumers would see hikes of 8 per cent 'or more' next year. The Los Angeles Times reported that some rates in Los Angeles are expected to rise by 16 per cent. But the worst news in California is yet to come: Dave Jones, the state's insurance commissioner, said current numbers are 'merely a pause in the double-digit rate increases we've seen historically.' In November voters will consider Proposition 45, a measure that would expand Jones's authority to set insurance rates. Insurers, Jones told the Times, may be holding rates down in anticipation of the new system, provided it passes. Complicating things further is a recent ruling from the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. that found it's illegal for the government to extend health insurance subsidies to consumers in states that didn't set up their own exchanges. If the decision stands, people in 36 states would likely see their out-of-pocket expenses skyrocket. The subsidies amount to as much as $450 per month in some states like Wyoming and Mississippi. Residents of Utah and Tennessee would lose the least, an average of about $150 per month. A separate court ruled the same day that those subsidies are constitutional. The Obama administration is appealing the ruling it disagrees with. Any increase, no matter how modest, will likely bring catcalls from conservatives and other Republicans. Ten months ago, Obama stood in the White House Rose Garden and promised that Obamacare, then in mid-website-meltdown, would sort out okay for Americans . President Barack Obama promised Americans during his 2008 presidential campaign – and long afterward – that his Affordable Care Act law would bring health care savings of $2,500 per family each year, on average, by the end of his first term in office. He also promised on dozens of occasions that Americans could 'keep their health care plans' if they wanted to. That promise quickly vanished as insurers sent millions of cancellation notices since existing plans often didn't conform to the lengthy and byzantine collection of mandatory benefits Congress decided every American must have. Those requirements, as much as any other factor, have driven up costs. Some opinion-shapers are beginning to dissect the reasons for rate hikes, and new taxes are part of the picture. Obamacare will 'result in insurance plans being taxed more than $100 billion between 2014 and 2022,' the right-leaning Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial board wrote on July 23, 'with the Congressional Budget Office concluding that the taxes ""would be largely passed through to consumers in the form of higher premiums for private coverage"".' The Review-Journal has called for a complete repeal of the law. In a CNN poll released July 23, twice as many Americans say the law has hurt them compared with those who say it helped. 'Thirty-five percent of Americans told pollsters that Obamacare has made them and their families worse off. Just 18 percent believe they are better off. Forty-six percent, almost half of Americans, say the law has made no difference in their lives.","Rate hikes will vary from state to state next year, with Florida appearing hardest-hit so far .
Many insurers with more modest increases have been keeping rates down by limiting which doctors, hospitals and prescription drugs are covered .
California could see rates skyrocket if voters approve new authority for the insurance commissioner in November .
A federal court ruling, if it stands, would hike monthly costs by as much as $450 because the federal government would no longer be able to subsidize rates in 36 states ."
"U.S. safety regulators are pushing for a nationwide recall of cars with potentially lethal defective Takata air bags, increasing pressure on the industry to move faster in a growing scandal. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also criticized Takata for what it called 'an unwillingness to move forward' on a recall, and said the company needs to be open with the U.S. public about the risks of its air bags. Japanese supplier Takata and automakers have so far taken a targeted approach in recalling U.S. vehicles with air bags that can rupture upon deployment, shooting shrapnel into the car. The earlier recall limited to several mostly southern US states needed to be expanded to the full country, said David Friedman, deputy administrator of the  NHTSA. Scroll down for video . Japanese supplier Takata and automakers have so far taken a targeted approach in recalling U.S. vehicles with air bags that can rupture upon deployment, shooting shrapnel into the car . 'We now know that millions of vehicles must be recalled to address defective Takata air bags and our aggressive investigation is far from over,' he added. 'We're pushing Takata and all affected manufacturers to issue the recall and to ensure the recalls capture the full scope of the problems.' The agency warned that if Takata - subject of a US criminal investigation into its exploding air bags - and the manufacturers do not quickly make the recall voluntarily, it will use its powers to force one. On Tuesday it also ordered Takata to provide documents and other detailed information on the propellant used in its air bag inflators. 'In recent days, Takata has publicly conceded that it changed the chemical mix of its air bag inflator propellant in newly designed inflators,' the NHTSA said. 'As part of its ongoing investigation, the agency will analyze the information received to determine if the chemical composition of Takata's propellant mix may be a cause and/or contributing factor in the air bag inflator ruptures.' Five fatalities, including four in the United States, have been linked to the airbags. The U.S. regional recall involved 4.1 million cars hot and humid areas where the air bags may be prone to fail, including Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana and parts of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico. Most of those cars are made by Honda Motor, Takata's biggest client. Senator Claire McCaskill, pictured during a hearing on Capitol Hill, supported a nationwide recall. She said if auto manufacturers did not comply she was in favor of forced measures . Ford, Honda, Mazda and Chrysler said they would continue to cooperate with NHTSA and plan to evaluate their call for a national recall. But each stopped short of saying they would expand beyond the current set of cars they are fixing. BMW is already recalling air bags nationally. Spokesman Alby Berman said Takata would cooperate with . regulators and automakers if an expanded recall is required, but . noted that 'of almost 1,000 passenger and driver inflators from . outside the high humidity areas that have been evaluated to . date, none have ruptured'. 'Takata is concerned that a national recall could . potentially divert replacement air bags from where they're . needed, putting lives at risk,' he said in a statement. It's unclear just how long it could take to replace so many . air bags. NHTSA said it is pressuring Takata to ramp up . production of replacement parts and has said it will explore . using other suppliers to help with production if needed. A Takata employee sews an airbag at the company's crash-testing facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan . Takata has said it would add two production lines at its . Monclova, Mexico plant in January to make replacement air bag . inflators. Workers there have told Reuters that a single line . has a typical quota of around 200 inflators an hour, meaning it . could take five months to make 1 million inflators working . around the clock on two lines, five days a week. U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, who is the chairman of the panel on consumer protection, supported a nationwide recall. She said if auto manufacturers did not comply she was in favor of forced measures. 'The confusion surrounding this air bag defect has gone on for too long,' she said. 'Today's announcement is overdue but welcome, and it's my hope that Takata and the other automakers that haven't yet done so will quickly agree to NHTSA's request - if they don't, regulators should force a mandatory national recall.' The ratcheting up of pressure on Takata comes ahead of a Senate hearing Thursday at which top officials from Takata, Honda and Chrysler are scheduled to testify on the defect, blamed for several deaths and numerous injuries in the United States and elsewhere. Friedman will also testify, with the agency facing growing calls to explain why recalls so far have been limited to only several US states. Japanese firm Takata -- subject of a US criminal investigation into its exploding air bags -- has been asked to provide documents and other information on the propellant used in its deadly air bags . In contrast, about 16 million cars worldwide from 10 automakers have been recalled over the defect. Last month, in its initial warning, the NHTSA said that motorists in warm-weather US states should take 'urgent' action because the air bags were thought to have a greater risk of rupturing in cars operated in areas with high humidity. In Tuesday's statement, the agency stuck by its view that cars in warm, humid climates are most likely to suffer the problem. It said: 'While NHTSA is not aware of either field incidents or test data suggesting that the problem affecting passenger-side air bags in the areas of persistently high humidity extends beyond those areas, the agency has been pushing the industry to perform testing to ensure that current recalls effectively cover vehicles with air bags that could be potentially affected by this defect.' Auto safety advocates and lawmakers said NHTSA's latest move . may still not capture the scope of the problem, is too late, and . may not be enforceable. Democratic Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal said . they were pleased NHTSA recognized the 'national scope' of the . problem,' but said the call to replace driver-side air bags . should be expanded to also include passenger air bags.","NHTSA said previous recall limited to southern states must be expanded .

"Israel has destroyed the home of a Palestinian who ran over and killed two people in Jerusalem last month just days after militants killed four rabbis and a policeman at a synagogue in the city. The east Jerusalem home of Abdel-Rahman Shaloudi, 21, was blown up before dawn, the Israeli Defence Force said. The decision to destroy it is likely to further inflame tensions that are already on a knife edge after a spate of clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in the wake of this year's two month war in Gaza. Shaloudi was shot dead by police as he tried to flee after mowing down commuters at a light railway stop on October 22. Scroll down for video .

Pictured is a doorway, smashed to pieces in Shaloudi's east Jerusalem home . A tweet (pictured) today by the Israeli Defence Force confirmed the home had been demolished . Violence in Jerusalem and other areas of Israel and the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories has surged since July when a Palestinian teenager was burned to death by Jewish assailants, an alleged revenge attack for the abduction and killing of three Jewish teens by Palestinian militants in the occupied West Bank. Israel's army has blown up or demolished militants' homes for decades but stopped the practice in 2005, saying it was counterproductive. However, court-sanctioned demolitions resumed earlier this year. The move to destroy his home was condemned by Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Programme Director. He said: 'Punishing the families of suspects by destroying their homes is collective punishment and is prohibited by international law. 'Tensions across the West Bank have been at fever pitch following the conflict in Gaza this summer. 'Authorities must not trample over the rights of Palestinians through collective punishments and other heavy-handed measures in order to restore security.' Israel has reinstated its controversial policy of destroying the homes of those who carry out terrorist attacks. Pictured is a man wandering through the rubble in Shaloudi's home .

A young boy attempts to push part of the wall back into place in what remains of Shaloudi's home. Shaloudi drove a car into a crowded tram stop late last month, killing a woman and a baby . Tuesday's attack at a Jerusalem synagogue where the four rabbis and a policeman were killed was the worst in the city since 2008 when a Palestinian gunman killed eight people at a religious school. Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed revenge on the Palestinians responsible for the attack on the Jerusalem synagogue, pledging to demolish the homes of the men involved. Speaking just hours after the attack, he said he would 'settle the score with every terrorist', claiming those who wanted to force the Israeli people out of Jerusalem would not succeed. He said: 'We are in a battle over Jerusalem, our eternal capital.' Tensions have deepened in Silwan and other areas of Arab East Jerusalem in recent months, with almost nightly clashes between Palestinians throwing rocks and setting off firecrackers and armed Israeli police firing stun grenades and tear gas. The unrest has grown since the July-August war in Gaza and the movement of dozens of Jewish settlers into Silwan in recent weeks. A push by Orthodox Jews to be allowed to pray at an Old City site that is holy to both Muslims and Jews, in defiance of a decades-long ban agreed by Israel, has also fuelled anger.

'Boys listen to Tita Karen--if a girl says NO and pushes you away, just err on the side of caution, she likely means NO. And go watch ""Sweeney Todd."" She continued: 'I count myself among those worked really hard especially in the 90's for the rights of girls and women so it really got me upset. 'I was shaking when I took it. I wanted to throw up.' Since the photo was posted on September 22, it has now received 1,578 likes,  4,383 shares and 440 comments. One user wrote: 'I just got out of bed to go to the bathroom but this one now woke me up. I don't even know what exactly to say -- this is just so wrong.' Another said: 'SM has all the resources in the world. They need to hire better people so this never happens again and they really need to make up for this now. 'A big company has an even bigger social responsibility to control what goes through their stores.' The bad publicity led to SM Supermalls removing all of the T-shirts from their stores. The picture of the T-shirt has prompted thousands of angry reactions on social networking sites including Twitter and Facebook . The have also released a statement on their Facebook page. It said: 'We have been informed via social media that we have a T-shirt in stock with a message that we too find unacceptable. 'We do not tolerate such action. 'SM does not support such irresponsible and malicious acts that mock important and sensitive social issues. 'We have immediately pulled out all the t-shirts of the consignor that distributes them, and we are investigating why it was included in our delivery of assorted T-shirts.' The woman who initially posted the picture is now appealing to people on social networks to come forward if they know the company that initially designed the clothes. After an international backlash, SM Supermalls quickly removed the T-shirts from their stores and issued a public apology . A spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England & Wales said: 'While we've come across products like this in the past, Rape Crisis England & Wales finds it shocking and deeply disappointing that garments like these continue to be designed, manufactured and retailed. 'Rape is a violent, terrifying crime that has a wide range of long-term and often lifelong impacts on those it affects. 'So-called jokes like this are not only offensive and distressing to the huge numbers of sexual violence survivors who come across them but, when printed on T-shirts marketed to young boys, are also potentially damaging. 'While some might argue that this kind of slogan is just harmless fun or 'banter', through our frontline specialist work supporting those affected by sexual violence, we know they contribute to wider social attitudes that trivialise sexual violence and violence against women and girls and make it difficult for survivors of these horrific crimes to seek the support and justice they want and deserve.'","Karen Kunawicz put picture of top on Facebook after spotting it in a Filipino store .

"Sean Dyche has challenged Danny Ings to prove that his head has not been turned by speculation of a move to Liverpool by firing Burnley to Premier League survival. The Burnley boss admitted after last weekend’s defeat at Sunderland that the England Under-21 striker looked as though he had been distracted by the transfer talk. Liverpool failed to sign Ings before deadline day but are expected to try and agree a pre-contract that would guarantee the 22-year-old a £5million move to Anfield in the summer. Danny Ings has impressed during his debut season in the Premier League with Burnley - scoring seven goals . Liverpool failed to sign Ings - who is out-of-contract at the end of the season - on transfer deadline day . Dyche warned the player that he will have to get used to the speculation and expectation if he wants to make it to the top. He said: ‘Danny’s a big player in Burnley but there’s a long way to go until you’re a really big player, and he has now gone onto a different level of learning. ‘If your journey is to play at the super top elite levels then you are going to have deal with a lot. If you’re Lionel Messi, you are scrutinised constantly every inch of your life. Sean Dyche wants Ings to show the speculation hasn't got to his head and help keep Burnley up this season . ‘The signs are that Danny is going to let his contract run down. He’s a young player who has a decision and it will naturally unfold.’ Asked about the prospect of Ings signing a pre-contract with Liverpool, Dyche added: ‘I leave that to the powers that be and any clubs that are interested. ‘It’s all a bit grey in this country. In Germany they’re very open about this sort of the thing. The player almost says farewell and the fans accept it, and he keeps playing. They know he’s going to give his lot.'","Danny Ings has been in impressive form for Burnley this term .

"CIA Director John Brennan apologized to Senate intelligence committee leaders on Thursday after his inspector general found that CIA employees improperly searched Senate computers this year. The mea culpa comes as a sharp about-face for Brennan, who denied in March that anyone in his agency was unconstitutionally spying on legislators or their staff. 'Nothing could be further from the truth,' he said then, after California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein accused the CIA of hacking into computers to track whether Senate aides had improperly accessed classified documents. 'We wouldn’t do that,' he had said. 'That’s just beyond the scope of reason in terms of what we’d do.' When the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong,' he added. Sorry: CIA Director John Brennan has apologized to leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee after agency employees snooped on the committee's computers . But Feinsten released a statement Thursday saying that the CIA's inspector general 'confirmed what I said on the Senate floor in March – CIA personnel inappropriately searched Senate Intelligence Committee computers in violation of an agreement we had reached, and I believe in violation of the constitutional separation of powers.' 'Director Brennan apologized for these actions and submitted the IG report to an accountability board. These are positive first steps. This IG report corrects the record and it is my understanding that a declassified report will be made available to the public shortly.; . Agency spokesman Dean Boyd said in a statement on Thursday that Brennan has convened an . accountability board that will investigate the conduct of the CIA . officers and discipline them, if need be. He has asked former Sen. Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat, to advise him about the results of the inspector general inquiry. Boyd said that advice might include recommendations for 'potential disciplinary measures and/or steps to address systemic issues.' The . Justice Department has so far declined to pursue criminal charges . against the employees, who searched the computers for information . gathered in the course of a Senate investigation into the CIA's . interrogation techniques. The CIA inspector general concluded 'that some CIA employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached between' the committee and the CIA in 2009 regarding access to a shared classified computer network, Boyd said. Brennan informed Senate intelligence committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the senior Republican on the committee, 'and apologized to them for such actions by CIA officers as described in the (inspector general's) report,' Boyd said. The development was the subject of wildly different characterizations by sources on either side of the dispute, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to go beyond official statements. Feinstein charged in March that her staffers' computer security was breached by CIA hackers, but Brennan flatly denied it at the time . Senate aides familiar with the matter say the CIA used classified 'hacking tools' and created a fake user account in an effort to retrieve documents the CIA believed the Senate staffers had improperly accessed. A U.S. official familiar with the inspector general report told the Associated Press that no hacking tools were used, and said that there was no malicious intent behind the CIA actions, but simply an effort to account for documents believed to have been improperly accessed. Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Wednesday in a statement that Brennan should issue 'a public apology ... to staff and the committee, a full accounting of how this occurred and a commitment there will be no further attempts to undermine Congressional oversight of CIA activities.'","John Brennan said he's investigating the CIA employees who hacked into Senate Intelligence Committee PCs .

"Surgeons have used Google Glass in a UK operating theatre for the first time in the UK. The voice-activated glasses, which feature a tiny display above the wearer’s eyes, can record video and live-stream operations via the internet. David Isaac, an orthopaedic surgeon at Torbay Hospital in Devon, became the first surgeon in the UK to use Google Glass through an operation. David Isaac, an orthopaedic surgeon at Torbay Hospital, in Devon, has become the first surgeon in the UK to perform an operation while wearing Google Glass . Google Glass has since been used by surgeons across the hospital, including in a variety of orthopaedic procedures and ear, nose and throat operations. Dr George Brighton, core surgical . trainee and app inventor at the hospital, managed to acquire a set of . Google Glass last November, before the official launch in the UK. Torbay Hospital says the technology has ‘huge potential’ for medical education, with students in a lecture theatre able to see and hear from the surgeon’s viewpoint. Google . Glass enables users to access functions including maps, voice search, . video calls and email, calendar and photos hands-free. ‘The . device itself is effectively a smartphone, head-mounted video camera . and computer rolled into one, with an eye-level screen,’ Dr Brighton . said. ‘What’s . exciting for medical education is that it allows surgeons to record and . share their direct view of the surgical field. This gives huge potential . for mentoring and conferencing. Since Mr Isaac (right) carried out an operation wearing the glasses other surgeons at the hospital have also tried them. The hospital says they could be a fantastic teaching tool as they allow operations to be filmed meaning students can see surgery from the surgeon's perspective . ‘If, . for example, you were performing a rare or complex procedure, you could . seek the advice of experts anywhere across the globe while operating. ‘The device would also enable consultants to mentor junior surgeons through a procedure, extending their hands-on learning. ‘Or . procedures could be streamed to lecture theatres full of students, . giving them virtually the full field of vision the surgeon sees.' Before . using Google Glass in theatre, surgeons talk to their patients about the . project and how footage will be used. They must give their signed . consent before any filming. ‘Two of . the key issues we have had to address while using Google Glass in the . operating theatre are patient confidentiality and privacy,’ Mr Isaac . said. ‘We . take these matters very seriously and have been using the past six . months as a trial period to address the issues while still aiming to get . the very best from the potential that this technology has to offer . within surgical education. The hospital says the main difficulty it has had in using Google Glass in operations is ensuring patient confidentiality and privacy is maintained . ‘We . have been investigating the ability to stream and store video to a . secure network that can only be accessed by those with the relevant . consent, and while we can’t currently use Google Glass to connect and . stream to the internet, we are just about to start live-streaming to . junior doctors and medical students within the Trust.’ Surgeons . are currently exploring a number of technical challenges, such as how . to be explicit about when the camera is filming and when it is switched . off. They are also working out how to upload footage of longer procedures without crashing the computer’s memory. Dr Kerri Jones, consultant anaesthetist and associate medical director for innovation and improvement at the hospital, said: ‘The trialling of Google Glass here is a perfect example of how innovative practitioners such as George are being encouraged to look at leading-edge technologies and assess whether we can use them in a way which would add to the quality of care for people in our area.’","David Isaac, at Torbay Hospital, was first surgeon in UK to use the device .

"As Israel and Hamas crept nearer to the ignition of a regional war over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was riding a Pee-Wee Herman-style bicycle – a female model – near his home on the swanky island of Nantucket. First President Obama's 'mom jeans,' and now this. A Boston Herald columnist wrote Monday that 'Kerry – rarely camera-shy – couldn’t be found,' on Saturday and Sunday. He was, apparently, out for a ride on a pink bike. Everything but handlebar tassles: Kerry's feminine bicycle will likely be the subject of jokes for years to come . Kerry ditched his sandals and his cute ride or the U.S.-Africa Business Forum in Washington on Tuesday, but seemed less than pleased to be in the spotlight . Big adventure: Kerry's island ride had all the masculinity of a Pee-Wee Herman cameo -- without the horizontal bike crossbar . And as Gaza turned into the world's latest flashpoint, the Herald writer noted, the job of explaining the United States' position 'was left to President Obama himself and other White House officials.' National Review Online, a conservative website, was first to point a mocking figure at the secretary of state, courtesy of a photograph posted on a Nantucket tourist Owen Perkins' Instagram feed. Perkins told the publication that he took the photo early Sunday afternoon near Kerry's home in Nantucket's swanky Brant Point neighborhood. Conservatives will make hay over the photo, of course, which looks more like President Barack Obama in his 'mom jeans' than Vladimir Putin and his bear-wrestling. The Kremlin has spared no effort in the past to cast the White House as weak and feminine. After Obama announced a new round of sanctions on Russia last week, in response to Moscow's continued encroachment in the Ukraine, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted a split-screen photo of Putin and Obama side-by-side. In the image, the Russian leader is posed with a leopard and the U.S. president is holding a poodle. Kerry's thrill ride as the Middle East burns isn't his first bid to get out of Dodge for some rest and relaxation during a global crisis. Second time around: Kerry was spotted sailing last year on a Wednesday as Egypt saw its president overthrown by Islamist radicals . Worse than 'mom jeans'? Maybe. In 2014 as Egypt's political tumult led to the overthrow of then-president Mohamed Morsi, the State Department insisted that the secretary was 'working all day and on the phone dealing with the crisis.' But CBS News obtained a picture of him on his sailboat in Nantucket sound on a Wednesday as regime change approached in Cairo. A quick about-face followed, with Kerry spokeswoman Jen Psaki conceding he was 'briefly on his boat' before returning to the salt mines of international diplomacy. 'Secretary Kerry worked around the clock all day,' she insisted, water sports notwithstanding, 'including participating in the President's meeting with his national security council.' Russia's deputy prime minister tweeted a picture last week mocking Barack Obama's masculinity just days after the U.S. president announced a fresh wave of sanctions against the country .","US Secretary of State was nowhere to be found over the weekend despite tensions between Israel and Hamas .

"British women are dying earlier than some of their counterparts in other European countries including Portugal, Greece and Slovenia, a report has warned. A woman living in the UK will have an average life expectancy that is two years shorter than women in France, Spain and Italy – as well as a year shorter than the average in Cyprus, Malta or Andorra. Female obesity levels in Britain are also the worst in Europe, with 23 per cent of women considered too fat, double the continent’s average. British women are dying earlier than some of their counterparts in other European countries including Portugal, Greece and Slovenia . And the study revealed that the death rates in Britain for children under five are higher than in most neighbouring countries, with even comparably poor states such as the Czech Republic and Estonia faring better. Britain was ranked 21st out of 28 countries who could provide figures for death rates in the under-fives, only coming ahead of former Eastern bloc countries. The World Health Organisation and . academics from University College London compiled the report which, for . the first time, provides a detailed comparison between the overall . health levels in more than 50 countries in Europe. British women and children could enjoy a healthier life across the Channel in countries including Slovenia (stock photo) It shows Britain ranks 21st out of 53 for female life expectancy rates – just behind Greece, Slovenia and Portugal. On average British women live to the age of 83 compared to 85 in Spain, France and Italy. But for men, the figures are considerably better, with the nation placed 11th. Men in Britain live to an average age of 78 compared to 80 in Israel  and Iceland, which have the  joint highest life expectancies. Professor Michael Marmot, from University College London, said: ‘We are failing too many of our children, women and young people on a grand scale. ‘I . would say to any government that cares about the health of its . population – look at the impact that their policies have on the lives . people are able to lead and, more importantly, at the impact on . inequality.’ Professor . Marmot, who chaired the report, said he believes the country’s failure . to tackle rising obesity levels is partly to blame for the disappointing . figures. He said: ‘For . obesity, particularly female obesity, we are absolutely dreadful. It’s . dramatic and appalling that we have such high levels of obesity. We . really are storing up big problems there. We are doing very badly.’ He added: ‘Why we eat so unhealthily is a much more broader and complex question. ‘We think there are things we can do to change that but we’ve not done very much so far.’ He . also warned that youngsters who are not working or studying are . ‘storing up a public health timebomb’ – as they tend to have worse . lifestyle habits and suffer from higher levels of depression and . suicide. They will also have . far lower incomes, meaning their children will be more likely to live . in poverty and be unhealthier, he said. The picturesque shores of Slovenia's Lake Bled could be the key to women and children living healthier lives for longer, the World Health Organisation report has revealed . And . he described unemployment in this age group as ‘very worrying’ adding . that the impact it would have on their own  children’s health will be . ‘tragic’. Public health minister Jane Ellison said: ‘This report underlines the stubborn nature of health inequalities across Europe. ‘It . reinforces the message that people’s health is shaped by the conditions . in which they live, work and age – and that action is needed to improve . them.’ This revealing map shows the stark contrast in life expectancy between different European countries.

"Controversial gas drilling did cause a series of earthquakes along the Lancashire coastline, a report today confirmed. Gas company Cuadrilla Resources, which is extracting shale gas in the region, commissioned the independent study after two tremors shook Fylde coastline in April and May this year. Energy chiefs have now sent a stark warning to the firm - either stop the earthquakes or be shut down. How shale gas is being extracted from deep beneath Lancashire . British energy consortium Cuadrilla Resources has discovered that Lancashire is sitting on one of largest reserve of ‘shale gas’ in Europe. According to results from its test wells, there are 200trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the ground, trapped in a layer of compacted mud. If the gas can be recovered, it could provide Britain with enough fuel to last 50 years, plug the looming energy shortfall caused by reduced North Sea gas supplies and create 5,600 jobs. And it could turn Blackpool from the leisure capital of the North, to the centre of England’s oil and gas industry - a Texas-by-the-sea. Two hundred trillion cubic feet is an unimaginably vast amount of gas. It is ten times more than all the gas known to be left under the North Sea. It’s one-fifth the size of the biggest gas field in the world, and the volume of 66,666 Royal Albert Halls. The prospect of 400 gas wells across Lancashire and thousands of new jobs - not to mention all those tax revenues - couldn’t have come at a better time for the Chancellor. But there is one problem - in gas and oil exploration, if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. It comes after Cuadrilla held urgent . talks with the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to . consider the report into the risk of earthquakes associated with . 'fracking' - the process used to extract shale gas. The meetings followed the British . Geological Survey's conclusion that the two tremors felt nearby were . most likely to have been caused by fracking. On April 1, a magnitude 2.3 earthquake . shook the North-West. It originated less than two miles from an . experimental shale gas well near Blackpool run by Cuadrilla. A second tremor occurred on May 27 with a magnitude of 1.5. The epicentre was within 500 yards of the well. The BGS said the correlations between . the earthquakes and the time of fracking operations, and the proximity . of the quakes to the site, all pointed towards the earthquakes being a . result of the fracking process. Seismologist Brian Baptie said: 'These . were still very small earthquakes, even by UK standards and won't cause . any damage. If fracking continued I couldn't see the tremors getting . much bigger. 'But it is obviously a concern for . local residents and I'm sure the report commissioned by Cuadrilla will . be greeted with interest.' Cuadrilla has came under fire from . activists for its drilling technique, which involves pumping high . volumes of water and sand into drill holes to crack the rocks so gas can . be extracted. Soon after the quakes were felt the . firm halted the fracking process after admitting the low magnitude . tremors felt in Poulton in April and May, close to Cuadrilla's Singleton . site , could be linked to them. Experts today said Cuadrilla's . operations could be shut down permanently if proposed methods to reduce . the risk of earthquakes fail. Toni Harvey, a senior DECC . geoscientist, said: 'If we allow fracking to continue and their . mitigation didn't work, then we would shut them down again, without a . doubt. 'There is a lot of concern in the media and from ministers about public safety. Resort town: Could the discovery of a huge amount of shale gas beneath Lancashire turn Blackpool into Texas-by-the-sea? Fracking is a mining technique commonly used to get gas or oil from under land rather than under the sea. To get the gas out, companies drill down into shale and form a well. They then inject wells with water, small amounts of chemicals and sand to create tiny cracks in the rock, allowing natural gas and sometimes oil to flow upwards into the well. The technique could add about 40 per cent to previous estimates of global recoverable gas resources, with the largest known reserves are in China, the United States, Argentina and Mexico. However, It is now feared the process could be the cause of small earthquakes. Critics such as the Green Party say that it is environmentally unsafe because the chemicals could contaminate soil and get into drinking water. 'DECC has requested a detailed report . from Cuadrilla, which we understand they are close to finalising. When . the report is received, it will be carefully considered, with input from . British Geological Survey and other experts. 'We will also be discussing the report . with other regulators before any decision is made on resuming hydraulic . fracturing operations for shale gas.' Last month Cuadrilla, the first . company to explore for shale gas in Britain, announced the Fylde coast . holds a total potential resource of 200trillion cubic feet of gas. It estimated the discovery - between . Blackpool and Southport - could be worth £6billion to the UK economy and . create 1,700 jobs locally. However, protesters are campaigning to . stop the drilling and anti-fracking group Frack Off - London rallied . outside the DECC headquarters on Thursday as Cuadrilla presented its . study. Philip Mitchell, the chairman of the . Blackpool and Fylde Green Party, called on the government to halt all . British hydraulic fracturing industry activity until there has been a . thorough and robust evaluation of the risks related to future activity. He said: 'Any suggestion of an acceptable level of earthquakes caused by fracking should be rejected. 'The government must realise it must . stop treating our communities like guinea pigs and accept these . techniques carry unacceptable risks to the British public. 'Ministers must stop the industry . activity at least until parliament and the public can be guided by a . full and robust appraisal of the total risk to the themselves and to the . environment.' Mark Miller, CEO of Cuadrilla . Resources, said: 'We met with officials from DECC and their technical . advisors and had a useful, in-depth working session on the initial . findings of the report. 'There is some considerable work still . to do and we absolutely share with DECC the need to have the complex . issues involved addressed dealt with satisfactorily.'","Controversial 'fracking' process blamed for tremors .

"Manchester United beat relegation threatened Sunderland at Old Trafford thanks to a second half double from England international Wayne Rooney. Rooney opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 66th minute before doubling the hosts lead with just six minutes left. Sunderland had defender Wes Brown wrongfully sent off during the game as the former Manchester United defender wrongly took the flak for a poor John O'Shea foul. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates every player's performance at Old Trafford . MANCHESTER UTD (4-2-3-1) David de Gea 6 – Little more than a spectator for the most part but pulled off a smart save from Wickham early on.

Manchester United's Marcos Rojo battles for the ball with Sunderland's Anthony Reveillere at Old Trafford . Jordi Gomez gets his foot to the ball ahead of Manchester United defender Chris Smalling at Old Trafford . Chris Smalling 6 – Got forward a few times to launch United attacks in the absence of much creativity from his midfielders. Jonny Evans 5 – Booed on a couple of occasions by the United fans for passing back to his goalkeeper and needs to be a little more positive, even for a centre-back. Marcos Rojo 6 – Kept Adam Johnson quiet down the Sunderland right and made one vital interception to deny the former England man in the first half. Striker Connor Wickham uses his strength to hold off Manchester United right back Antonio Valencia . Ander Herrera 5.5 – Played alongside Blind at the base of a 4-2-3-1 but made very little impact on the game. Had a goal ruled out for offside towards the end. Daley Blind 6.5 – Usual competent, tidy job from the Dutchman. Tested Pantilimon with a decent effort from range in the second half. Angel di Maria 4 – His worst performance for United yet. Took the wrong option time and again, and not one of his tricks came off. Hooked at half-time. Angel di Maria again struggled to live up to the hype as the Argentine found himself hauled off at half time . Wayne Rooney 7.5 – United skipper had to be happy with a deeper role again, but lifted his side from a lethargic performance by scoring both goals. Ashley Young 6.5 – United’s biggest threat in the first half and was unlucky to see one goalbound effort deflected against the underside of the bar. Radamel Falcao 6 – Earned the penalty for United and an ovation from the fans when he was subbed immediately afterwards. Plenty of effort from the Colombian bit the cutting edge is still lacking. Wayne Rooney scored from the spot as Manchester United earned all three points against Sunderland . SUNDERLAND (4-1-4-1) Costel Pantilimon 6 – Not tested nearly enough in the first half. Made some good saves after the interval and had no chance with the penalty. Anthony Reveillere 5.5 – Had his hands full against Ashley Young and struggled at times. John O’Shea 5 – Enjoyed a large slice of luck on his return to Old Trafford, diverting a Young effort against the underside of the bar and escaping a red card for fouling Falcao. Wes Brown 6 – Former United man did a good marking job on Falcao and was very unfortunate to be sent off for fouling the Colombian when the guilty man was teammate John O’Shea. Radamel Falcao controls the ball ahead of Reveillere  during the Premier League match at Old Trafford . Patrick van Aanholt 6 – Got forward a couple of times to send in searching crosses but pinned back for much of the game. Lee Cattermole 6.5 – A key part of Sunderland’s defensive plan and made a couple of fantastic interceptions, including one on Young in the first half. Adam Johnson 5.5 – Upset the United fans with a clear dive and made little impression. Subbed towards the end. Sebastien Larsson 6 – Had to be more defensive than usual and rescued his team with a goal-line clearance in the first half. Former Tottenham Hotspur striker Jermain Defoe battles for the ball with Manchester United's Smalling . Jordi Gomez 5 – Former Wigan man produced very little of note, but this was not a day for Sunderland’s creative players. Connor Wickham 5.5 – Had Sunderland’s best chance when he broke forward from deep to test De Gea but struggled to make an impact after that and came off after 67 minutes. Jermain Defoe 6 – Lively in the first and pestered United’s back-four in a lonely role up front, but faded after half-time and subbed at the same time as Wickham . Referee Roger East – 4 .

He told the news website The Daily Signal that it was his decision to keep his state's National Guard detachment out of the law-enforcement business. 'Their real job is not apprehension,' Perry said. 'Border Patrol apprehends.' But many of those federal agents have been re-tasked in recent months to glorified babysitting duties, caring for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors flooding the border. Public outcry, especially among Texas ranchers and tea party groups, drove Perry to deploy the National Guard. He said Tuesday that U.S. Border Patrol agents will be grateful for the help. 'They aren’t displacing Border Patrol,' Perry said of the National Guard troops, who will number as many as 1,000. 'It'll be just like how we partner with law enforcement. They want to see the border secure, so they won’t resist the assistance. Just the presence and knowledge that they’re deployed will have a powerful message.' The National Guard will mostly work alongside state law-enforcement officers deployed at the  border by Perry earlier this month. 'For those who say, ""This is very out of the ordinary,"" the National Guard being at the border is not an unusual situation,' he added. 'There’s troops at the border every year and there’s troops there now.' President George W. Bush ordered National Guard units to patrol America's southwest border in 2006. President Barack Obama extended that order in 2010. But his 2012 executive order of a virtual amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children before 2007 has led to a wave of Central American children and teens seeking the same treatment. With that development, existing border security measures have proven inadequate. FLOOD: Hundreds of children and teens from Central American countries pour across the border daily and turn themselves in to federal agents, hoping for a 'permiso' document that will allow them to stay pending an immigration court hearing . Obama visited Texas just weeks ago but decided not to visit the border region. Perry later said that during a private meeting, Obama conceded that he was unaware most U.S. Border Patrol officers were stationed dozens of miles inside the United States – not on the border itself. That arrangement has left them powerless to detain illegal immigrants until they are in the United States. Perry's deployment of Texas Department of Public Safety officers followed that meeting. 'The responsibility for securing the border rests exclusively on the federal government,' Perry wrote to that agency's director on June 18. 'The federal government's failure to secure the border has created an incentive for families to send their children on a dangerous, and sometimes fatal, journey.' 'Until the federal government fulfills its duty,' Perry declared, 'it falls on the State of Texas to address those obligations.'","Texas governor deployed up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the US-Mexico border this month but didn't give them arrest powers .

"A couple have been ordered to rip down their £200,000 luxury house annexe - because it was built 20 centimetres too wide. Stephen and Mary Kindred transformed a decaying old barn in the garden of their home in Hurst, Berkshire, into a luxury building with offices, a gym and three guest bedrooms. But planning bosses have told them to tear the annexe down because it is 20cm too wide and the chimney and porch were said to be 'harmful to the countryside'. Stephen and Mary Kindred have been ordered to rip down their £200,000 luxury house annexe (pictured left) in Hurst, Berkshire, because it was 20 centimetres too wide . Mr Kindred, a heating engineer, said: 'This is a terrible joke that is fast becoming a nightmare and has cost us so far in the region of £200,000, not to mention thousands of pounds in extras caused by legal fees, red tape and the appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. 'We have not done anything wrong.' Work in the front garden of their home started earlier this year after Mr Kindred bought the former pub seven years ago. The couple reassured planning bosses they would not live in the annexe or rent it out and offered to remove the chimney and porch, but were told to appeal the order. Mrs Kindred said: 'This is very upsetting because we thought we were doing the right thing by improving the old barn, which was in a dangerous condition. We are not overlooked by anybody, nobody has complained. 'They are quibbling over 20 centimetres. And how can a chimney and porch be harmful to the countryside?' The couple transformed a decaying old barn in the garden of their home in Hurst, Berkshire, into a luxury building with offices, a gym and three guest bedrooms . Wokingham Borough Council slapped an enforcement notice on the couple in July, which gave them two months to comply or face legal action. In a hand-delivered letter, Clare Lawrence, head of the council's development management team, said the building was in an unsuitable location outside of settlement limits, in an area designated as countryside. Cllr John Kaiser, executive member for highways and planning, said: 'This isn’t the case that the owners of Fox and Hounds cottage have built a building that’s 20cm to large as claimed – it’s a much bigger issue than that and one that we have to tackle as part of our duty as the local planning authority. Quite simply, the owners have built a house in the countryside that they don’t have permission for. 'And this is not acceptable. I hope this sends a clear message that we will take action against people who flout planning laws. 'I would urge anyone who suspects someone of carrying out major work without planning permission to get in touch with the council and we will investigate.' The couple have now appealed to the Planning Inspectorate and will not know the final decision until next year.","Stephen and Mary Kindred transformed old barn into a luxury building with offices, a gym and three guest bedrooms .

"The TV dinner is still alive and kicking with 50 per cent of Brits admitting they eat in front of the television - an increase from five years ago when 40 per cent said the same. And the growing trend of the 'always on' digital generation, means that 20 per cent of Brits will have their dinner in front of a computer at least four times a week. While the dinner table is still regarded by the Great British public as the last bastion of family values, one in seven Brit households don't own one (15 per cent) and over a third (34 per cent) rarely or never use them, a report revealed. TV dinners: Half of Brits admit to eating their dinner in front of the television a new survey revealed . More than 80 per cent of Brits surveyed believe the dinner table is still the best place for families to come together. However, despite this belief, living circumstances and balancing work demands with family life mean that modern British families are not able to do this more often. Just under two thirds (63 per cent) of Brits said they are being kept away from eating with their friends, families and loved ones due to lack of free time in daily schedules, work commitments, space restrictions, and distance. The nationwide trend of working longer hours is having a direct impact on British dining habits with 7.5 per cent of Brits admitting to eating theirs at work at least four times a week. This more than doubles in the capital with 18 per cent of Londoners saying they do the same. Additionally, 11 per cent of Londoners admitted to eating in the bath and 14 per cent said they eat in their bedrooms at least four times a week. More than 80% of Brits surveyed believe the dinner table is still the best place for families to come together . The study was commissioned as part of the recently launched Bisto Together Project, a campaign that seeks to bring more people together at mealtimes. To mark the launch of the campaign 100 specially designed, space-saving dinner tables were given away to families. Made by The Wilson Brothers, the tables are designed to meet the demands of space-short families across and can be collapsed and stored in the smallest of homes. Helen Warren-Piper, from Bisto said: 'Bisto has over 100 years' experience of bringing British families together over the dinner table and we want to help this tradition continue for years to come. 'The Bisto Together Project is on a quest to help the British public overcome their barriers and come together more often with those that are close to them to share memorable moments around the table.'","63% of Brits are kept away from family dinner due to lack of free time .

"Professor John Ashton has stepped down from his role within the Faculty of Public Health following a vicious Twitter spat . A prominent Government health adviser has been forced to stand aside for sending abusive messages on Twitter. Professor John Ashton stepped down as president of the Faculty of Public Health yesterday following a venomous spat on the social media site. The doctor, who is strongly opposed to e-cigarettes, called one supporter a ‘c***’. In another tweet he said: ‘These abusive ecig people remind me of the lads who used to play with themselves behind the bike sheds at school. 'They are even more pathetic than that. 'Need ecigs to get aroused.’ He had been involved in a debate about the merits and dangers of e-cigarettes. Advocates say they help smokers quit, while objectors such as Prof Ashton – who want tighter controls – are concerned about their long-term effects. They also believe the tobacco industry is using e-cigarettes to lure youngsters into smoking. In the online debate, Prof Ashton complained he was being abused by e-cig ‘trolls’ and accused them of being apologists for the industry. He hit back at one, saying: ‘Have you always been an anonymous c***.’ And he told another: ‘I think I have identified a new species of human being this week. 'Obsessive, compulsive, abusive onanist with ecig tendencies.’ As president of the faculty, which is independent of Government, he gives advice to ministers on public health. A statement posted on its website stated the faculty ‘apologises unreservedly’ for Prof Ashton’s comments. While some say e-cigarettes are better for health, others, like Professor Ashton, worry about their long term effects . It said: ‘Professor Ashton used inappropriate and offensive language, which unnecessarily personalised a public health issue, and we do not condone its use. An investigation is currently under way.’ Earlier in the week Prof Ashton tweeted: ‘I very much regret my choice of language to describe some vapers... and any offence caused.’","Professor John Ashton quit role as president of Faculty of Public Health .

"President Barack Obama fired a double-barreled volley at Republicans on Wednesday, saying that the GOP is 'hating' him by pursuing a federal lawsuit over changes to the Obamacare health insurance law. The lawsuit received a go-ahead hours later by a 225-201 vote, passing the House of Representatives along largely party lines with five Republicans voting 'no.' Every Democrat opposed the legislation authorizing the lawsuit. 'There’s a bunch of stuff that needs to get done,' Obama told a cheering, partisan audience in Kansas City, Missouri just hours earlier. 'Unfortunately, I think the main vote ... that they’ve scheduled for today is whether or not they decide to sue me for doing my job.' 'And, by the way,' he added, 'I’ve told them – I said, I’d be happy to do it . with you. So the only reason I’m doing it on my own is because you . don’t do anything.' In an off-the-cuff speech filled with rabble-rousing language, Obama blamed Republicans in the House of Representatives for blocking his agenda on make-work infrastructure jobs, illegal immigration and a minimum wage hike. But he reserved his biggest applause lines for an attack on the idea of facing a federal judge over questions of executive overreach. 'Stop just hating': Obama singled out congressional Republicans for scorn on Wednesday in Kansas City, mocking efforts to sue him for overextending his authority with changes to the Obamacare law . Campaign-style love fest: President Obama (bottom, white shirt) greeted a partisan crowd after speaking about the economy . 'Some of the things we’re doing without Congress are making a difference, but we could do so much more if Congress would just come on and help out a little bit,' he said to applause. 'Just come on. Come on and help out a little bit. Stop being mad all the time. Stop just hating all the time. Come on. Let’s get some work done together.' The lawsuit that faces the Obama administration is focused on unilateral changes the White House made to the Affordable Care Act, a sweeping health insurance overhaul passed by Democrats without any Republican votes. On July 11 House Speaker John Boehner announced that his lawsuit would go ahead. Obama, he said, 'changed the health care law without a vote of Congress' in 2013, 'effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it.' The president, he carped, 'believes he has the power to make his own laws.'The Obama administration has taken several actions that Republicans say twisted the plain meaning of the Obamacare law's black-letter text, ignoring dates that the law set in stone – for both practical and political reasons.' The administration has twice pushed back the law's requirement that large employers provide health insurance to their workers, even though the law reads that it 'shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013.' Companies with between 50 and 99 employees now can flout the law until 2016 without paying tax penalties. Larger employers have until 2015. In a twist of irony, Republicans themselves sought similar delays in 2013 when America's two major political parties came to loggerheads during a budget battle, forcing a temporary, partial government shutdown. Obama's changes, however, came without consulting Congress: By the time the Treasury Department put them in place, the House was in Republican hands and no longer in the mood to tinker with America's gargantuan medical insurance market. On Wednesday, the president was in full combat mode again. House Rules Committee chairman Rep. Pete Sessions carried the ball for Republicans on Wednesday in a hearing to finalize the terms of a lawsuit against the Obama administration . 'Look, we’ve got just today and tomorrow until Congress leaves town for a month,' he said, 'and we’ve still got some serious work to do.' 'I mean, everybody recognizes this is a political stunt,' he said of the lawsuit, 'but it’s worse than that, because every vote they’re taking like that means a vote they’re not taking to actually help you. ... And, by the way, you know who is paying for this suit they’re going to file?  You.' Speaker of the House John Boehner has insisted that his lawsuit won't be a prelude to impeachment, but only an action to force the president to uphold his duties under the Constitution . Obama also claimed that if Boehner's legal action were to go to trial, 'I would have already left office' by the time it was resolved. 'So it’s not a productive thing to do.' On Monday Boehner penned an op-ed in USA Today, arguing that suing the president is 'not about me vs. President Obama. This is about future Congresses and future presidents.' 'There is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch of our government. It is the judiciary branch’s role to help resolve it. I believe this path is the right one to defend our institution and preserve the Constitution.' On July 24 the House Rules Committee green-lighted suing the president in a preliminary vote that fell along partisan lines. As the committee met Wednesday to finalize the language and move for a debaet on the House floor, warring sides heard from constitutional lawyers and picked fights with each other over whether Obama has abused his power. 'This is not a political issue. This is not an issue that should pit Republicans against Democrats,' said Texas Republican Rep. Pete Sessions, who chairs the committee. 'Any person interested in our Constitution and our brilliant system of separation of powers should be worried about what is currently happening in our country.' Florida Democrat Alcee Hastings disagreed, calling the lawsuit 'frivolous on steroids. It's absolutely insane what you all are doing.' 'This is a partisan political stunt timed to peak in the House of Representatives in November, right as the midterm elections are happening,' added New York Democratic Rep. Louisie Slaughter. 'The House majority is suing the president simply for doing his job.' Hastings was a federal judge until 1989, when he was impeached and removed from office, one of only eight federal officials in U.S. history to wear that professional stain. In that case, both houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats. His impeachment was carried out on charges of bribery and perjury. The House of Representatives, to which he now belongs, condemned him by a vote of 413-3. Hypocrite: New York Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter opposed the lawsuit on Wednesday but once joined in a similar legal action against President George W. Bush . Florida Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings slammed the planned lawsuit as a partisan witch-hunt formulated for political advantage in November's midterm elections; he has been on the receiving end of ethics proceedings before, as the only member of Congress to have been impeached and removed from the bench as a federal judge . Slaughter joined in a 2006 lawsuit against President George W. Bush over that year's federal budget bill. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told the Rules Committee that 'it is not a political question when this body goes to court and says the president has exceeded his authority.' If Congress fails to hold the White House to its constitutional responsibilities, he said, 'I think this system is going to change in a very significant and in my view a dangerous way.' Attorney Walter Dellinger, a former Clinton administration official, said in his testimony that asking a federal judge to settle disputes when the president doesn't administer a law the way the House wants 'would be an unprecedented aggrandizement of the political power of the judiciary.' 'Such a radical liberalization of the role of unelected judges in matters previously entrusted to the elected branches of government should be rejected,' he said. The U.S. Constitution requires the president to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' Florida International University law professor Elizabeth Price Foley told the panel on Wednesday that Republicans have 'an excellent chance' of winning a lawsuit if it focuses on the meaning of that line in America's founding document. In a sparsely attended press conference following the vote to sue the president, House minority Leader Nancy Pelosi blamed Republicans for frittering away money on a lawsuit that 'should not be a priority.' 'We don't have money to have early childhood education for children, they have rejected the president's universal pre-K, but they do have money to sue the president,' Pelosi said. 'How much money is that? Nobody knows.' She also insisted the Congress 'lacks standing' to sue. 'They certainly do not have standing to sue the President of the United States.' 'This is about the road to impeachment,' she claimed, although Boehner said this week that impeachment is off the table. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer accused Republicans of wasting time and Americans' money in search of 'partisan political confrontations.' 'This lawsuit will go nowhere,' he predicted.","House vote Wednesday afternoon confirmed that Congress will sue Obama .

"A Melbourne man has posted an advertisement for a haunted chair on eBay. Andre Williams from Croydon in Melbourne picked up the wicker chair from hard rubbish two years ago and is hoping to sell it for $666. In the eBay advertisement, he describes the chair as a 'Vintage 1900s cane chair haunted by [a] poltergeist'. A chair that is 'haunted by a poltergeist' has been advertised for sale on eBay by a Melbourne seller . 'After a week of having it in the house, I heard some crying during the night (I thought I was dreaming),' he writes in the item description. 'Then in the morning I noticed that the chair was on its side. I didn't connect the dots until it happened several times over two years. 'Sometimes there is laughing accompanied by tapping noises… the chair is always in a different spot afterwards (moves up to three metres) leaving shallow dent marks across the floor.' The advertisement also said the chair had 'severe scratch marks' on the arms 'like someone has been aggressively dragging their fingernails'. Mr Williams wrote that some repair work had been done on the piece, but it was not fully restored because he was 'too afraid to touch the chair'. The seller wrote on the item description that he frequently found the chair on its side after hearing crying and tapping . Bidding for the chair starts at $25 and the buy-it-now price is $666 . 'I would be glad to get rid of it and pass it on to someone who has had experience with this kind of thing. Please help!!!’ The opening bid for the chair is set at $25, though a keen purchaser can buy it now for $666. As yet there have been no bids placed on the item, but 16 people are watching it and the advertisement gets more than 100 views a day. Mr Williams, who is an artist, told Daily Mail Australia that the advertisement 'was meant to be a bit of theatre’. 'People get so caught up in [supernatural things] that they want to make it true, they believe what they want to believe. It was a bit of experiment in human behaviour and human psychology,’ he said. Mr Williams says that if the chair does not sell he will reinvent the chair as something else and list it again. 'That could be fun, the changing personality of this chair.’","Andre Williams from Melbourne is trying to sell a 'vintage 1900s cane chair haunted by [a] poltergeist'

"Jack P Shepherd, who plays David Platt in Coronation Street, was forced to apologise after making jokes about the fire at the kennels . Hundreds of Coronation Street fans have called for Jack P Shepherd to be sacked after he made jokes about the Manchester Dogs' Home fire which claimed the lives of 60 animals. The actor, 26, who plays David Platt in the ITV soap, was forced into an apology after causing uproar on Twitter when he said: 'I have a million 'hot dog' jokes'. When people responded with complaints and messages of disbelief he added: 'You guys need to lighten up. #GetItLightenUp.' Hours later when it became how many animals have perished in the fire on Thursday night, he issued a grovelling apology. He said: 'I sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. This was not intended to be a malicious tweet and I didn't consider the offence it would cause. 'At the time I didn't realise the scale of the tragedy but that doesn't excuse my behaviour. I now realise how insensitive I have been. 'I have made a donation to the MCR dogs home and I'm very sorry for my behaviour.' More than £1.36million has been raised for the dogs' home which will be used to rebuild the home in Harpurhey. Firefighters said the 150 dogs rescued from the blaze had been moved to a sister site, Cheshire Dogs' Home. Around 400 people have agreed to provide permanent homes to dogs, with 300 more responding to the charity's 'foster auction' to find short-term homes. His offensive and ill-timed tweets about Manchester Dogs' Home sparked outrage on social media . Coronation Street bosses pledged to speak to the actor, who has appeared in the show since he was 12, after reading his tweets. A spokeswoman for the show said: 'Jack quickly realised the insensitivity of his tweets and deleted them straight away. 'Jack's ill-judged and insensitive tweets were clearly unacceptable and we will be talking to him about his conduct.' Fans have threatened to boycott the show until the young actor is fired. The fire raged through  the dogs' home, killing 60 animals as hundreds of others yelped in their cages . Dawn Bradbury was reunited with her two-year-old bichon frisé, Leo, who survived the fire . Emma Anne Marie tweeted: 'Refusing to watch @itvcorrie until the disgracful excuse for a human being @jackpshepherd88 has been sacked. How heartless can you get?!' Fern Cook tweeted: 'Jack Shepherd (David Platt in Coronation Street) should be sacked for those disgusting comments.' A 15-year-old was arrested on suspicion of deliberately starting the fire, but the teenager has been bailed pending further enquiries. The boy – who is the subject of death threats from furious animal lovers on social media sites – cannot be named for legal reasons. Chelsea Bond 28, and  Rick Yates from Newton-Le-Willows,  have adopted Elsie who was saved from the fire . It has been revealed that the teenager was attacked by Rhodesian ridgeback earlier this year. Yesterday police urged his family to move, but the boy's defiant mother, 49, insisted they would not be forced out and said the allegations were a 'pack of lies'. 'They have said that he has had to move away, that the police told him to go away for his own safety but as you can see he is still here,' she said. 'I don't care what people are saying about threats. I am still here and I'm not leaving. I don't want to talk about it because people will twist everything we say.' A vigil for the dogs that died in the fire will be held at the local Christ Church at 6pm tonight.

"Top officials from the U.S. and Israel defended Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday against charges in the Israeli press that his efforts to secure a cease-fire in Gaza leaned toward helping the terror group Hamas. Speaking at the National Press Club, Rice said the Obama administration is 'dismayed by some press reports in Israel mischaracterizing his efforts last week to achieve a cease-fire.' 'We know these misleading reports in turn raise concerns here at home in America.' Kerry is seen among hawkish Israelis as a moderating force whose insistence on military withdrawals will aid Hamas in its guerrilla warfare. The Palestinian group has taken to digging Viet Cong-style 'terror tunnels' in order to gain quick access to targets in areas of Hamas controlled by Israel. President Barack Obama on Sunday urged Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to an 'immediate, unconditional humanitarian cease-fire' with Hamas. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Dismayed': National Security Adviser Susan Rice gently defended Secretary of State John Kerry against charges from inside the Israeli government that his cease-fire proposal favored the Palestinian terror group Hamas . Ambassador Ron Dermer of Israel spoke at a National Leadership Assembly for Israel, saying it was 'unwarranted' to attack Kerry . The heads of state spoke following Israel's rejection Friday of a new cease-fire agreement with . Hamas negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Ron Dermer, Tel Aviv's ambassador to . Washington, was even more measured in his language on Monday than Rice was, appearing at the same . National Press Club event. 'Israel appreciates that President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who is here today, have strongly supported Israel’s right to defend itself,' said Dermer. 'We also appreciate their efforts to help achieve a sustainable cease-fire.' 'I speak directly for my Prime Minister here,' he said. 'The criticism of Secretary Kerry for his good faith efforts to advance a sustainable cease-fire is unwarranted.' Dermer and Rice spoke alongside House Speaker John Boehner, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, and the leaders of major Jewish advocacy groups. The Conference of Presidents of . Major American Jewish Organizations and the Jewish Federations of North . America hosted the event. After Kerry's cease-fire bid fell apart last week, an Israeli news report quoted 'voices' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet describing Kerry as 'completely capitulating' to Hamas and 'negligent.' One top Israeli journalist compared Kerry to a space alien. Those characterizations had the White House 'fuming' on Monday, according to the Associated Press. Dissent: A pro-Palestinian protester interrupted the Jewish summit on Monday as more than 600 advocates for Israel looked on . In a post on liberal news publication Haaretz's website over the weekend, diplomatic correspondent Barack Ravid said Kerry did more to 'thwart the possibility of reaching a cease-fire in Gaza' than he did to promote one. He went on to say Kerry would be 'responsible for every additional drop of blood that is spilled' if his actions resulted in an escalation of Israeli military aggression. 'Kerry isn’t anti-Israeli; on the contrary, he’s a true friend to Israel,' Ravid wrote. 'But his conduct in recent days over the Gaza cease-fire raises serious doubts over his judgment and perception of regional events. 'It’s as if he isn’t the foreign minister of the world’s most powerful nation, but an alien, who just disembarked his spaceship in the Mideast.' Fighting resumed between Israel and Hamas on Sunday morning as the clock ran out on a temporary cease-fire that put the nearly three weeks old armed conflict on hold for a half day. Appearing on CNN's 'State of the Union' program on Sunday morning, Netanyahu reaffirmed his country's refusal of Hamas' ultimatum and chastised his enemies' violation of previously agreed upon cease-fires. 'Israel is doing what any country would do, and certainly what the U.S. would do,' Netanyahu said. The White House said Obama called the Israeli Prime Minster that afternoon and told him 'ultimately' a long-term solution 'must ensure the disarmament . of terrorist groups and the demilitarization of Gaza.' However, the White House said Obama shared the administration's 'serious and growing concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives, as well as the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.' As of Sunday, more than a thousand Palestinians had been killed in the conflict and up to 6,000 others had been injured, according to AP. Nearly four dozen Israeli soldiers and three civilians and three civilians have also been killed. In excerpts of an interview with Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal that aired Sunday and Monday on CBS, Meshaal told Charlie Rose that  'the world has two choices' – to help Hamas 'peacefully' remove Israel from the West Bank and the Gaza strip or 'we will expel this occupation from our land.' 'We are not fanatics. We are not fundamentalists. We do not, actually, fight the Jews because they are Jews per se – we fight the occupiers,' he said. Hamas will keep fighting the 'occupiers,' he said, until it is victorious. 'I . can die because of Israel. I cannot live under the occupation. The . occupation is the worst thing that you can ever imagine,' he said. 'So . every single Palestinian can die for the next generations to live in . peace and freedom.' Mashaal . danced around whether Hamas would 'coexist with the state of Israel' if . Palestine had its own state before telling Rose, 'When we have a . Palestinian state, then the Palestinian state will decide on its . policies,' adding that the 'Palestinian people can have their say, when . they have their own state, without occupation.' United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said today that both Netanyahu and Mashaal . were 'morally wrong' for allowing the death and destruction to continue . and the two men need to show 'compassionate leadership' by ending the . armed conflict. He joined Obama and the U.N. Security Council in calling for 'an . immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease-fire,' saying that 'Gaza . is in critical condition.' Ban also said Israel's retaliation against Hamas raises 'serious questions about proportionality.' His . statement follows a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution last week . approving an international investigation into Israel for potential war . crimes in Gaza. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said on Sunday that he would . 'condemn' the report because it places the blame for the conflict on . Israel. 'The U.N. Human Rights report is a joke,' Graham said in comments reported by Politico. 'The U.N. is becoming anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic.' Throughout Israel it was Secretary Kerry who was the subject of mockery in weekend commentary. Maariv columnist Ben Caspit called Kerry 'an ongoing embarrassment, with the characteristics of a snowball.' 'The further he rolls, the greater the embarrassment,' Caspit said. Israeli TV reporter Udi Segal ran a report citing government officials who framed Kerry as 'incapable of handling the most basic matters.' The Associated Press said Monday that Obama administration officials said on background that by ridiculing Kerry, Israeli ministers 'crossed a line' and relations between Israel and the U.S. may never be as close as it once was as a result. In on the record comments Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken came to Kerry's defense. 'Israel has no better friend, no stronger defender than John Kerry,' he told AP. The comments about Kerry are 'people leaking things that are either misinformed, or attempting to misinform,' he claimed.","Secretary of State John Kerry tried to negotiate a long-term cease-fire between Israel and Hamas last week but was unsuccessful .

"Five Thai university students were detained for 'attitude adjustment' after giving a three-fingered salute inspired by The Hunger Games to the army-backed prime minister in a daring protest against the country's military government. The students, wearing T-shirts saying 'Don't Want a Coup,' stood up with their backs to General Prayuth Chan-ocha while he spoke on a stage in Khon Kaen, a city in the northeast, an area that is a stronghold of former Premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup. They raised three fingers above their heads, a symbol of resistance inspired by the book trilogy and Hollywood blockbuster, before police escorted them out. Five Thai university students were detained for 'attitude adjustment' after giving a three-fingered salute inspired by The Hunger Games. Pictured is Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen . The five men from Khon Kaen University were taken to a police station and then an army camp for 'attitude adjustment', a security official said. Human rights lawyer Sasinan Thamnithinan said that they had not been charged. Thai protesters used the salute immediately after the May 22 coup, but have mostly stopped amid police crackdowns on demonstrations. In The Hunger Games, the salute symbolizes rebellion against totalitarian rule, signifying thanks, admiration and good-bye to a loved one. But Thai protesters have also cited the French Revolution's values of liberty, equality, fraternity, while others said it means freedom, election and democracy. Mockingjay, the third movie in the The Hunger Games series, opens in Thai cinemas on Thursday . Prayuth, often prickly with critics, stopped his speech when the students stood, and smiled calmly. 'Anyone else wants to protest? Come quickly. Then I can continue with my speech,' he said into the microphone as the audience chuckled. Since taking power from a civilian, elected government in May, the military has heavily suppressed resistance from opposition groups and activists. Martial law, invoked a few days before the coup, remains in effect and bans political gatherings of five or more people.

"President Obama says his landmark visit to Myanmar is an acknowledgement of the democratic transition underway but not an endorsement of the country's government. Obama's words were aimed at countering critics who say his trip to the country also known as Burma is premature. While Myanmar has undertaken significant reforms, hundreds of political prisoners are still detained and ethnic violence has displaced more than 100,000 people. The President says his goal in visiting Myanmar is to highlight the steps the Asian nation still needs to take. He says he also wants to congratulate the people of Myanmar for having 'opened the door' to being a country that respects human rights and political freedom. Scroll down for video . Go East: Barack Obama and Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra review an honor guard during a welcoming ceremony at Government House in Bangkok . Spiritual: Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tour the Viharn of the Reclining Buddha with Chaokun Suthee Thammanuwat . Obama spoke on Sunday during a news conference with Thailand's prime minister. Barack Obama also said it is 'no accident' that he planned his first foreign trip to Asia after winning re-election. Speaking at a news conference on . Sunday in Bangkok, Obama emphasized that the United States is a 'Pacific . nation'. He says the Asia-Pacific region will be crucial for creating . jobs in the U.S. and shaping its security and prosperity. Thailand is Obama's first stop on a three-day tour of Asia that will also take him to Myanmar and Cambodia. Obama's praised Thailand for being a . supporter of democracy in Myanmar, the once-pariah state that is rapidly . reforming. He says he appreciated the Thai prime minister's insights . into Myanmar during their meetings on Sunday. While in Asia, however, Obama will be . dividing his attention by monitoring the escalating conflict between . Israel and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.

Quick trip: Obama and Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra arrive for a joint news conference during his three-day trip to Asia . Obama has been in regular contact . with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as with Egyptian . and Turkish leaders who might hold sway with the Hamas leadership. Obama landed in Bangkok on Sunday afternoon, greeted by 40 saluting military guards who flanked both sides of a red carpet. His schedule is packed with sightseeing, a royal audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a private meeting with Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, a joint press conference and an official dinner. On a steamy day, Obama began with a visit to the Wat Pho Royal Monastery, a cultural must-see in Bangkok. In stocking feet, the president and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton walked around a golden statue of a sitting Buddha. The complex is a sprawling display of buildings with colorful spires, gardens and waterfalls. Obama joked with a monk at the monastery that he hoped praying would help his administration reach a deal on the budget. At his news conference with PM Shinawatra, Obama said: 'I always believe in prayer. If a Buddhist monk is wishing me well, I’m going to take whatever good vibes he can give me to try to deal with some challenges back home.' Welcome tour: Thai Prime Minister Shinawatra, right, looks back at President Obama during a press conference in Bangkok . Friendly: Obama and Shinawatra burst into laughter during the press conference . Obama is also visiting Myanmar and Cambodia in his first trip abroad since winning a second term. The visit to Thailand, less than 18 hours long, is a gesture of friendship to a long-standing partner and major non-NATO ally. Still, . the two countries have faced strains, most recently after the 2006 . military coup that deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and . Obama's visit offers an opportunity to restate and broaden the . relationship. 'It was very important for us to send a signal to the region that allies are going to continue to be the foundation of our approach' to establishing a more prominent presence in Asia, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters traveling with the president aboard Air Force One. Time for reflection: Obama and Clinton admire a shrine during their monastery visit . Meeting: Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej talking to Obama along with the Secretary of State . Obama is also seeking to open new markets for U.S. businesses; the United States is Thailand's third biggest trading partner, behind China and Japan. Becoming a counterweight to China in the region is a keystone of Obama's so-called pivot to the Asia-Pacific region. Obama's trip comes on the heels of meetings in Thailand between Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and his Thai counterparts on security and military cooperation on issues ranging from fighting weapons proliferation to disaster relief to countering piracy. Alluding to the 2006 coup, Obama's . national security adviser, Tom Donilon, said in a speech ahead of the . trip last week that Obama would build on Panetta's outreach to reinforce . the relationship and 'support the continued peaceful restoration of . democratic order after a turbulent period.' On tour: Obama and Clinton at the Wat Pho Royal Monastery in Bangkok . Ceremony: Obama and Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra on the red carpet at Thai Government House in Bangkok . After his time at the temple, Obama paid a courtesy call to the ailing, 84-year-old U.S.-born King Bhumibol Adulyadej in his hospital quarters. The king, the longest serving living monarch, was born in Cambridge, Mass., and studied in Europe. The centerpiece of the Asia trip comes Monday when Obama travels to Myanmar, the once reclusive and autocratic state that has begun instituting democratic measures. Obama has eased sanction on the country, also known as Burma, and his visit will be the first there by a sitting U.S. president. Obama aides see Myanmar as not only a success story but also as a signal to other countries that the U.S. will reward democratic behavior. 'If Burma can continue to succeed in a democratic transition, then that can potentially send a powerful message regionally and around the world...that if countries do take the right decisions, we have to be there with incentives,' Rhodes said.",Obama and Secretary of State Clinton visited Wat Pho Royal Monastery in Bangkok .
"It's a condition that affects one in fifteen adults - and causes copious arguments - but you could be saying good night to snoring thanks to a new ring. The Good Night Anti-Snoring Ring claims to be a natural non-invasive way of getting a great night's sleep for you and your partner. The £29.99 piece of metal uses acupressure theory by applying pressure to specific points on your little finger. Scroll down for video . Good night: 15 million people snore in the UK and a new £29.99 ring claims to be a natural non-invasive way of getting a great night's sleep for you and your partner . Acupressure treatments are said to promote the release of endorphins - natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body. The ring works by applying the basic principles of this Chinese practice which dates from 3,000BC. It presses on a point either on the side or the base of the little finger between the knuckle and joint - SI2 (Small intestine 2) & HT9 (Heart Meridian 9) - to enable a better flow of energy to these parts of the body. Can it end your sleeping woes? The £29.99 piece of metal uses acupressure theory by applying pressure to specific points on your little finger . How it works: Worn on your little finger every night for 30 minutes before you sleep and until you wake, it presses on a point either on the side or the base of the little finger between the knuckle and joint . The pressure creates a positive stimulus of the central nervous system and it is claimed that this helps the throat and larynx muscles, reduces sinus swelling and drains the nasal cavities - reducing nasal congestion. The ring helped 85 per cent of snorers who trialled it. There are an estimated 15 million snorers in the UK and from nasal spray to expensive surgery, there is a huge market for gadgets that claim to beat snoring. Restless: Bed partners of snorers report they have just 3-5 hours sleep per night . Snoring . is no longer an ‘old person’s problem’. In part, this is because two of . the biggest factors that induce snoring are weight and alcohol. This . kind of snoring is different from sleep apnoea, a serious medical . condition where the airway narrows or closes altogether so that in . extreme cases the patient stops breathing for several seconds. There are 15 million snorers in the UK. 10.5 million men and 4.5 million womenThe three main reasons for snoring are: being overweight, smoking and drinking alcoholSnoring sound is air turbulance vibrating the structures in the ‘upper airway’.Snoring sounds range from 50dB to 100dB - the equivalent to a pneumatic drill.Snorers are three times more likely to suffer adverse health conditions than non-snorers.Snoring can be hereditary - nearly 70 per cent of snorers have a familial link.Bed partners of snorers report they have just 3-5 hours sleep per night.

More than $1.6million has been spent on the millwork alone at the 242-acre estate . The property features a horse barn with paddocks and offers stunning views of the Rocky Mountains . Often seen as the father of modern industry, car maker Henry Ford implemented an idea that revolutionised manufacturing. He launched the modern assembly line in a factory in a suburb of Detroit to speed up motor production. Ford's River Rouge plant in Detroit, Michigan, went on to become the largest factory in the world. Ford produced a standard model, the Model T Ford. A new Model T Ford cost less than $300 in the mid-1920s. By 1929, more than 26 million cars were registered in the U.S. During the 1920s, about $1 billion a year was spent on the construction of a national network of highways. The automobile industry also caused other industries such as steel, rubber, leather and paint to grow rapidly. Mark . Evernden, of Sotheby's, said: 'The Kettle Lakes Ranch, located in the . Municipal District of Foothills, includes a 5,000 sq ft home on 97 . hectares of land, which was owned 25 to 30 years ago by the infamous . Ford family of Henry Ford heritage.

'There was a full development in play but the MD wouldn't approve it because of the lay of the land and the damage it would cause to the natural part of it.

"The House of Representatives won't move to impeach President Barack Obama, and the idea is 'all a scam started by Democrats at the White House,' House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday. 'This whole talk about impeachment is coming from the president's own staff, and coming from Democrats on Capitol Hill,' Boehner told reporters. 'Why? Because they’re trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year's elections.' On Monday the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee emailed its largest donor list with a request for money based specifically on impeachment fears. SCAM: Boehner said Democrats have cooked up baseless impeachment fears in order to raise money . Smoking gun: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee begged donors for money on Monday by floating the idea that Republicans could impeach the president . The . president, vice president and first lady, the solicitation read, 'need . your help, because it’s a critical moment. House Republicans will vote . THIS WEEK to sue the President. And the White House believes it could . lead to Barack Obama’s impeachment.' 'It’s . time to have the President’s back. With the most critical deadline . we’ve faced in just days, we’re still 75,000 donations short of our . goal.' Adding fuel to Boehner's contention, a top White House aide used the 'I' word on Friday during a Christian Science Monitor breakfast event, tying the threat of impeachment to a lawsuit Boehner is pursuing against the Obama administration. The legal action, Dan Pfeiffer said, has 'opened the door' to a presidential impeachment. 'Impeachment is a very serious thing that has been bandied about by the recent Republican vice presidential nominee and others in a very un-serious way,' said Pfeiffer, hat-tipping former Alaska governor Sarah Palin. 'We take it very seriously and I don't think it would be a good thing.' Palin said of Obama just days ago in Denver that 'if he's not impeachable, then no one is.' Boehner has said plainly that his lawsuit, which focuses on the White House's unilateral changes to the Obamacare law, will not be a prelude to removing Obama from power. 'This is not about impeachment,' the House speaker said on July 9. 'This is about faithfully executing the laws of our country.' He added a more definitive statement on Tuesday, saying that the House leadership has 'no plans to impeach the president. We have no future plans.' Staying: Obama doesn't face an impeachment threat, Boehner said, preferring to take the president to federal court over his administration's changes to the Affordable Care Act . Impeachment refers to a formal process prescribed in the U.S. Constitution for throwing a president or a federal judge out of office. The House would first bring charges against Obama and vote to approve them. The Senate would then hold a trial on those charges and vote on whether to convict. The Constitution reserves impeachment as a remedy for 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' which the framers understood to be official crimes committed while in power. Boehner and other House leaders have tried to tamp down conservative Republicans' expectations in recent weeks. A senior House staffer told MailOnline that Tuesday's words would be welcome in establishment circles since Democrats' control of the Senate makes removing Obama from office a guaranteed non-starter. 'It shouldn't have taken this long for him to say it, but now that he's said it we can get back to things that won't backfire,' the aide said. A CNN/ORC International poll released on Friday found that one-third of Americans, 33 per cent, believe Obama should be impeached and removed from office. Fully 65 per cent disagreed.","House or Representatives won't move to impeach, Boehner told reporters .

"Some of the pornographic emails exchanged among Pennsylvania state government officials in a scandal that has claimed at least four jobs involved children and violent sexual acts against women, the state attorney general has revealed. Attorney General Kathleen Kane described the images 'deplorable' during an interview with CNN on Tuesday night. 'When I saw them they literally took my breath away,' Kane said. 'And they are deplorable: hardcore, graphic, sometimes violent emails that had a string of videos and pictures depicting sometimes children, old women. Some of them involved violent sexual acts against women.' 'Deplorable': Attorney General Kathleen Kane has revealed that the images included child porn and violent sexual acts against women . Kane, a Democrat, said a court order is preventing her from investigating them or explaining why. The court order stems from an investigation by a special prosecutor into whether Kane's office breached grand jury secrecy when it gave documents about a 2009 investigation to the Philadelphia Daily News. Kane did not describe the material involving children and violent sexual acts against women or say who exchanged it, and she was not asked in the interview to elaborate on it. In any case, no one who has viewed the emails has described them as having involved child pornography. One of Kane's lawyers in the case, Lanny Davis, said he had not seen all of the emails involved, and he was not sure to what Kane was referring. But, he said two images he saw of children were inappropriate but not necessarily child pornography. They were 'borderline,' he said. Unearthed: The emails surfaced during an examination of how state prosecutors handled the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse case . In one image, there were two children kissing, and in another a boy and a girl were peeking into each other's underwear, Davis said. Regarding material involving sexual violence against women, Davis described a scene in which a champagne bottle is used in a sex act and points to state Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald Castille's description of a video of a 'woman in sexual congress with a snake.' Last week, Kane said four of her employees had been fired and 11 suspended without pay for involvement in the pornographic email scandal, which also has prompted a state Supreme Court justice to step down. The hundreds of emails that Kane has released included pornographic or explicit photos, videos and jokes. Kane's office plans training, starting in December, for all employees and will set up a way for staff to report such behavior without facing retaliation. Kane previously had said the emails surfaced during an examination of how state prosecutors handled the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse case under her predecessors, a review she promised while running for the office in 2012. Retired: Justice Seamus McCaffery retired last month after his fellow justices suspended him amid the disclosure he had sent or received 234 of the emails . She also had disclosed the participation of eight former employees of the office, including several senior supervisors. That led at least four to leave government jobs elsewhere, including the state's environmental protection secretary. Others who remain in their jobs include the state's police commissioner and a prosecutor in the Philadelphia district attorney's office. Last month, Justice Seamus McCaffery retired after his fellow justices suspended him amid the disclosure he had he sent or received 234 of the emails. McCaffery sent most of the emails to a now-retired agent in the attorney general's office, who then forwarded the emails to others in the office, Castille has said. Kane, a former Lackawanna County prosecutor, is the first Democrat and first woman elected attorney general in Pennsylvania. She took over from Linda Kelly, one of two Republicans to serve on an interim basis after Republican Tom Corbett stepped down to become governor in 2011. Corbett has said he was not aware of the emails while heading the state prosecutor's office.","Four staffers at the  attorney general's office were fired earlier this month after they were discovered to have exchanged pornographic emails .

"When Israel Smith's wife gave birth to their son four years ago, he had never heard of men having post-natal depression. So as he started heading in a downward spiral in the months following Rilien's birth in October 2010, he never imagined it could be the cause of his fragile emotional state. Up until that point Mr Smith and his wife Belinda, from Coogee in Sydney, had successfully managed their photography business and raised their young daughter, Indrani. Israel Smith had never heard of men having post-natal depression when his wife Belinda gave birth to their son Rilien in 2010 . But when Rilien was born things took a turn for Mr Smith. 'I was holding on by a fingernail,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Smith had not long run a marathon and was feeling extra pressure at work with his wife having stepped away from their business to take care of their two children in the lead up to Christmas. 'With Belinda leaving (the business), broken sleep and the new dynamic of the extra person I felt a self-imposed pressure to make it work and be the hero,' he said. 'I didn't want to give my wife any indication of the stress, I wanted to give her the freedom to be a full-time mum. 'I was feeling really hopeless... I didn't know how to get out of this rut. I was feeling really lazy and lethargic. I was waking up angry or sad and I couldn't figure a way out of it.' Up until that point Mr Smith and his wife Belinda, from Coogee in Sydney, had successfully managed their photography business and raised their young daughter, Indrani . After two months Mr Smith's wife, who wasn't suffering with post-natal depression, said he had to see someone and the depression diagnosis quickly followed. 'One of things I noticed about myself was I thought I was being perfectly sane and rational, but I wasn't. The more I tried to insulate her from what was going on, the less present I was. 'I didn't want to be grumpy and unhappy, but by withdrawing from them they weren't getting the father figure they needed. It put a lot of pressure on my wife, she really ended up holding the business and family together. 'She was doing her best to love me while I was at my worst. There were some days she thought she couldn't keep going – to be the mum the kids needed… and be a supportive partner to the guy I married. It was pretty tough. It didn't feel like we were playing on the same team at that point.' Mr Smith had not long run a marathon and was feeling extra pressure at work with his wife having stepped away from their business to take care of their two children when he was diagnosed . Israel underwent treatment for a year to treat his depression after his wife Belinda advised him to seek help . Mr Smith said his wife experienced a really painful childbirth and five weeks later accidentally chopped part of her finger off and required surgery. 'We had this funny conversation... there was a disbelief I could be handling things that way when she lost part of her finger and a drug free childbirth. She's a whole lot of awesome... she had post-natal awesome,' he said. 'I just had no idea that post-natal depression related to men. I really thought it was solely the domain of women.' But Mr Smith, who underwent treatment for a year to treat his depression, isn't the only male affected. More than one in seven new mums and up to one in 20 new dads are diagnosed with post-natal depression each year in Australia, according to the Post and Antenatal Depression Association (PANDA). Sophie Ryan, from Launceston in Tasmania, battled post-natal depression for four years following the birth of her daughter Audrey.

Sophie, pictured here with her husband Dan, was 33 when she gave birth and felt like her life was in order . At the age of 33, Ms Ryan was adamant she had her life in order but things were turned upside down after the birth. 'I was always a very organised person. But when a baby comes along there's no schedule any more, there's no keeping to time frames,' she said. 'I had all the same things as new mothers like sleep deprivation and I had an awful lot of trouble breast feeding - I believe that had a huge impact on leading me to post-natal depression territory. 'In my mind I was thinking; I'm an educated person, there's no way I can't handle this. I didn't want people to think I was failing or a bad mother. 'I felt like I was a huge burden on everyone. I felt ungrateful because I had a beautiful baby girl – she wasn't difficult, she was wonderful. I felt like I was a burden on my husband and family because I wasn't enjoying life.' Sophie said she was sleep deprived like every new mum, but also had trouble breast feeding Audrey . Sophie said during the standardised testing to see if expecting or new mums are on the post-natal spectrum she lied to make it seem like she was okay . Ms Ryan said during the standardised testing to see if expecting or new mums are on the post-natal spectrum she lied to make it seem like she was okay. 'Looking back it was really foolish. I probably should have put my hand up and said I needed help,' she said. 'I can still remember the day I made the appointment to get help. My husband had to go back to work a fortnight after Audrey was born. I was feeling isolated at home and it gradually worsened. 'I was teary, anxious and exhausted, which is typical of a new mother, but it just never got easier and continued to worsen. 'I woke my husband and told him he couldn't go to work and that I wasn't coping.' Sophie was appointed a counsellor and was put on anti-depressants. She is now helping other women with post-natal depression via her website Shout It Out Loud . Ms Ryan was appointed a counsellor and she was put on anti-depressants. She's now helping other women with post-natal depression via her website Shout It Out Loud. 'I want to get across that people aren't alone.

"Christmas shoppers travelling back from Europe after attending festive fairs or on a ‘booze cruise’ have been warned they could be targeted by illegal immigrants desperate to reach Britain. Cars and other private vehicles could be increasingly hit by stowaways who have traditionally tried to enter Britain in lorries, said an executive at Eurotunnel. John Keefe, Eurotunnel's public affairs director, told MPs he feared the immigration crisis at Calais would intensify as queues develop in France in the run-up to Christmas. Scroll down for video . Christmas shoppers travelling back from Europe after attending festive fairs or on a ‘booze cruise’ have been warned they could be targeted by illegal immigrants desperate to reach Britain (stock picture) More than 2,500 immigrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, are massing around the port in the hope of sneaking aboard a ferry, train or lorry to reach the UK illegally. The city’s mayor Natacha Bouchart has said illegal migrants are 'prepared to die' to cross the Channel, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado. Mr Keefe told the House of Commons' home affairs select committee: ‘The crisis could potentially get even worse. As we approach winter, it could start to overlap on to the passenger market.’ He said that as the Christmas holiday season approached there would be longer queues of traffic as people waited to board the Channel Tunnel shuttle trains after shopping trips on the Continent. Mr Keefe said: ‘The slower the flows of traffic through the border, the more opportunity there is for migrants to jump on to vehicles.’ Cars and other private vehicles could be increasingly hit by stowaways who have traditionally tried to enter Britain in lorries, said an executive at Eurotunnel (stock picture) His warning came after it was reported that a suspected illegal immigrant managed to smuggle himself behind the front seat of a woman's Fiat Panda to get into Britain. In September, Sue Taber, 59, told how she arrived back on the Eurotunnel after a trip to Costa Blanca in Spain. She said she believed the man got into her car unseen as she stopped to put her dogs through the pet reception facility in Calais, and remained hidden until she arrived home near Dover, Kent. The man, who was aged in his late teens, was later detained by police and handed over to the Home Office. The Road Haulage Association's international affairs head Peter Cullum and the UK Chamber of Shipping's head of taxation, ferry and cruise Tim Reardon also told MPs they regarded Calais as being in crisis due to the migrant problem. Mr Cullum said the problem should have been sorted out years ago, while Mr Reardon said Calais was now regarded not as a port and a place to do business but as ‘a place where there is a problem with migrants’. Mr Keefe said migrants were living in ‘appalling conditions’ in Calais, adding: ""I have heard people say they are among the worst refugee camps in the world.""","MPs warned private vehicles could be increasingly hit by stowaways .

"Former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood was condemned by students yesterday for his ‘vulgar and sexist’ stage show at a freshers party. The 56-year-old compere made comments to his teen audience about their genitalia - singling out specific revellers for lewd comments and unwanted advances. He was the guest DJ at Leicester University’s We Love R&B gig at the O2 Academy in Leicester on Saturday. At one point he was heard shouting over the microphone: ‘Girl in the front row with the black dress on, I will be f****** you later.’ Controversial: Former Radio 1 DJ caused offence during a gig for the University of Leicester students at the O2 Academy (stock image) Westwood, who spent 20 years with Radio 1, told another girl: ‘Security have told me you need to wear a sports bra.’ And Westwood, whose father is a former Anglican Bishop, later published an Instagram video of a young couple raunchily dancing with the caption ‘Smash that homie’. His act left some of his audience unimpressed, and many said he had gone too far. Fresher Laurie Peters said: ‘Through the whole night he was being very vulgar towards the women in the audience. ‘It was uncomfortable and inappropriate, in my opinion, to ask which 18-year-olds in the audience wanted to display their private areas - and to tell someone that he would be ""f******"" her later on in the night'. Freshers' party: The Percy Gee Building of Leicester University, home to the Student Union . Venue: The O2 Academy in Leicester, where Westwood was a guest DJ at the university's We Love R&B party on Saturday . Kitty Rodwell said: ‘It was just one of those ""wow too far for someone of your age"" disgust kind of things, where everyone looked at each other and said ""I can’t believe those words just left his mouth"".’ Ross Copping said that he'd heard him make 'rather vulgar' remarks about women's genitalia. ‘The impression I gained from the . girls I was clubbing with was that he was plain derogatory and, although . a commendable DJ, had no place in our O2 Aademy if he wished to conduct . himself in such a manner.’ Fourth year Rarione Maniece said: . ‘Throughout his set he said some very inappropriate things... given how . old he was and how young the majority of the crowd was. Shocked: One of the students said many were looking at each other in disbelief at Westwood's comments . ‘I am pretty sure most of the kids there were young enough to be his children.’ A spokesman for Westwood denied the sexual language was harassment. They claimed the obscenities were all innocent quotes of lyrics from songs such as Pon Di Cocky by Aidonia, Stop Sign by Koshens and R. Kelly’s Bump N’ Grind. They said: ‘This was non-offensive banter with the crowd. At no point was offence meant, and none was taken by the people in the front row.’ The spokesperson added: 'Tim was DJ-ing from midnight to 4am for a University crowd aged over 18. 'The music he plays is hip-hop and reggae which includes, at times, explicit lyrics and Tim introduces some tracks by quoting their lyrics to the crowd. Tim apologises for any offence that may have been caused.' A source close to Tim Westwood said: 'Westwood has been gigging for years playing hip-hop and reggae so people going to his gigs know what music to expect and quoting lyrics is all part of the show. He is mortified that people would think he was being offensive as it is all part of the late night act.' Leicester’s student union this year announced a new zero tolerance policy on sexual harassment. Inspiration: Sacha Baron Cohen said he partly based Ali G on Tim Westwood . It bans ‘unwanted sexual comments, including comments about your body or private life’ and ‘unwelcome sexual invitations and innuendos’. Westwood has come in for criticism before, with his Radio 1 show accused of encouraging knife and gun crime by David Cameron, when he was the leader of the opposition. Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen said that his rap-loving character Ali G was partly inspired by Westwood.","Westwood made controversial remarks at a University of Leicester event .

And relish the opportunity provided by Yobaba Lounge to spend much of the day without mindless chitchat, in blissful, soothing silence. Putting your back into it: The Yobaba Lounge offers yoga breaks in a restored chateau in southern France . But Yobaba is no hair-shirt monastery — it's a boho chateau in southern France and new breed of retreat: simple and deeply spiritual, yet with oodles of style and plenty of creature comforts. There are no trendy yoga hybrids here and no corpulent spa menus stuffed with 'journeys' and 'rituals'. Straight hatha yoga and meditation are the main course, not an after-thought sandwiched either side of sunbathing by the pool. A wonderful place to stretch body and soul: The chateau has the feel of a 'vast, ancient temple' The house has the feel of a vast, ancient temple. The bedrooms have a certain monastic simplicity - uncluttered and candlelit - but they are huge and look as if they've been styled by Elle Decoration. Mine has a pared-back safari insouciance with a zebra throw on the carved wooden day-bed and a rocking lion guarding the freestanding bath. The one next door has a Moroccan air with a hammam-style bathroom. The food also dances a clever line between hip and healthy. Vegan, mainly raw, dairy/grain and sugar free; you'd think it would be gloomy on the eye and turgid on the palate. Instead flavours are light and bright and the presentation is artful - salads are turned into mandalas and chia porridge comes studded with star-bright blue borage and a swirl of freshly made compote. Every day ends with a pudding that tastes decadent, but which, the owner, Gertrud promises, is guilt-free. Come find yourself: As well as yoga sessions, the retreat offers day trips and oddly decadent puddings . You can spend your free time softly swinging in a hammock, but there are chances to break outside the walls. One afternoon we took a trip to Rennes-le-Chateau, of Da Vinci Code fame; on another we sat sipping chai and listening to mantras in a hilltop Cathar castle. Come the full moon, we built a fire on the shore of a nearby lake and had a moonlight dip before watching the flames for our evening meditation.

"Three Conservative MPs are undertaking their own ballots of voters on membership of the European Union that are almost identical to those carried by two Ukip defectors. With Conservative HQ on high alert ahead of an expected byelection defeat to Ukip tomorrow, it emerged that staunch Eurosceptics Peter Bone, Philip Hollobone and Martin Vickers are canvassing constituents on whether they want to be in or out of the EU. Both of the Conservatives who have jumped ship to Ukip, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, conducted similar exercises before announcing their defections. Scroll down for video . Tory MPs Peter Bone, Philip Hollobone and Martin Vickers have all canvassed their local voters on leaving the EU, just as the two Conservatives who defected to Ukip did . The leaflets being used by the Conservative MPs for their ballots bear striking similarities in design to those used by Mr Reckless. They are all thought to have been advised by an anti-EU campaigner with longstanding links to Ukip. Chris Bruni-Lowe worked for Mr Carswell in the months before his defection at the end of August, and had previously been employed by Mr Reckless, who jumped ship at the end of September. Mr Bone, Mr Hollobone and Mr Vickers have all firmly denied any intention to defect to Ukip. But the revelation of links between their local ballots on the EU and those carried out by Mr Carswell and Mr Reckless will heighten Tory jitters ahead of this week’s Rochester and Strood byelection. Senior Tories concede Mr Reckless currently appears on course to hold the Kent seat he previously represented for the Tories for Ukip on Thursday. But they hope other potential defectors will be deterred by the latest poll in the constituency, which puts Ukip on course for victory but suggests the Tories will retake the seat by a narrow margin in next May’s general election. A new survey by ComRes for PLMR shows 30 per cent of people say they would only vote for their current MP if they stay with their current party . David Cameron, visiting the seat again to campaign yesterday, told any more MPs considering defecting: ‘The point I make to everybody is that these things are entirely counter-productive. ‘If you want a referendum on Britain's future in Europe, the only way to get that is to make sure there's a Conservative government and to make sure that it’s me leading the country and not Ed Miliband. ‘Doing things that distract from that make the chance of an in-out referendum less likely so it’s entirely counter-productive. That's the argument I have made, and the argument I'll continue to make.’ A new opinion poll today showed just one in 13 (7 per cent) adults would vote for their current local MP if they joined UKIP, even though they would not normally vote for Ukip. It suggests very few MPs can expect to take their voters with them if they choose to defect. Elin Twigge, deputy managing director of communications firm PLMR, said: 'For any MPs with itchy feet, these polls will be a bit of a wake-up call.' Mark Reckless carried out a similar local ballot in Rochester and Strood before he defected to Ukip. He is expected to win the by-election in the seat tomorrow . Douglas Carswell, pictured with Ukip leader Nigel Farage, made political history by becoming Ukip's first elected MP in October after defecting from the Conservatives . Mr Bone, MP for Wellingborough, told the Daily Mail that unspecified ‘private donors’ were funding his referendum on EU membership, being conducted jointly with Mr Hollobone, MP for neighbouring Kettering, and Thomas Pursglove, the Conservative candidate for Corby. ‘Yes, the original referendum leaflet was a crib of the one that Mark Reckless did,’ Mr Bone said. ‘The person who has organised it and promoted it was the same guy that did the Reckless one. ‘This was signed off and approved at the highest level of the party a long time before Mr Reckless went to Ukip.’ Asked if he was considering defecting, the MP insisted: ‘I deny that 10,000 per cent. I have been a member of the Conservative Party since I was 15. I believe we should have a pact with Ukip [but] I have never had an discussions with anyone in Ukip about defecting.’ In a reference to the charm offensive launched by former Ukip treasurer Stuart Wheeler, who has attempted to woo potential defectors, Mr Bone joked: ‘I haven’t even been invited to lunch. I’ve spoken to Philip Hollobone about it and he has no intention of defecting either.’ The MP added: ‘I would like to see the Conservative Party put forward the policies that will win us the next election: ending free movement of citizens into this country, the PM committing to leading the out campaign if he doesn’t get what he wants in the EU renegotiation, and I would like to see an end to the coalition.’ Mr Vickers said there was ‘absolutely no way, under no circumstances whatsoever’ that he would switch to Ukip, despite conceding his ballot of constituents on EU membership was ‘very similar’ to those carried out by the defectors. ‘This has always been a Eurosceptic part of the world and the idea is to give my constituents an opportunity of expressing a view,’ he said. Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday insisted the only way to get a referendum on Britain's future in Europe was to vote Conservative, as he campaigned in Richester with Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst . However, Mr Vickers confirmed he had had ‘an approach’ from Ukip about standing down their candidate in his constituency of Cleethorpes in exchange for Ukip being allowed a free run in neighbouring Grimsby, one of its top targets. ‘From a purely selfish point of view, that would be quite welcome, but I can’t deliver it. Even if the local party was willing to do it, we’re a national party and we will have a candidate in every seat,’ he said. Stuart Coster, co-founder of the cross-party EU referendum campaign the People's Pledge, said: ‘That more Conservative MPs are consulting their local voters on EU membership in such a similar style to previous Ukip defectors should ring alarm bells in Number Ten. ‘David Cameron needs to reassure his backbenchers with an undertaking that, as a constitutional question about how Britain is governed, he will allow them free rein without party recrimination to campaign for either side in an EU referendum. ‘After nearly 40 years of EU rule changes since we last voted and the House of Commons estimating that up to 53 per cent of UK laws now have their origins in EU institutions, there is no democratic justification for any party to still refuse to hold an EU referendum.’","Peter Bone, Philip Hollobone and Martin Vickers carrying out local ballots .

"The biggest strike for five years will cause huge disruption to schools, courts and travel tomorrow in the most serious industrial challenge to the coalition since it was formed. Hundreds of thousands of teachers, lecturers, civil servants and other workers will walk out for 24 hours in protest at controversial plans to change their pensions, cut jobs and freeze pay. All police leave in the capital has been cancelled as the force seeks to control a huge protest march as well as walkouts by civilian staff at Scotland Yard. The strike will cause delays to people arriving at airports. Managers have been trained to step in to conduct airport passport checks amid staff shortages (file picture) The co-ordinated union action is also set to hit up to 15,000 schools, affecting seven million children . Extra officers are being parachuted . in to man 999 call centres with fears that a minority of activists may . attempt to hijack the march for their own purposes. The first effects of the strike . action will be felt tonight, before the official time of 12.01, with . staff at the Border Agency set to walkout early due to varying shift . patterns. That will cause huge problems for passengers at . Gatwick and Heathrow airports, which are warning passengers . of long delays at passport control. 'As far as we are concerned the . strike officially starts at 12.01 but the effects of it may be felt . earlier,' said a Border Agency spokesman. Tomorrow, Westminster Bridge will be . closed, as will the roads around the Palace of Westminster, with police . fearing 'Greek-style' protest outside Parliament. Security inside . Parliament is also going to be stepped up. Mark Serwotka, leader of the Public . and Commercial Services union, said it was the most important strike in . his union's history, adding: 'Everything we have ever worked for is . under attack.' Schools: Up to 15,000 will close . Airports and seaports: Severe delays expected . Courts: Urgent cases will be heard but trials may be postponed . Job centres: Jobseekers Allowance will be paid automatically with no signing on . Universities: 350 colleges and 75 universities to close or partially shut . Whitehall: Skeleton staff . Driving tests: Licenses and tax discs should be applied for online . Coastguard: Expected to continue as usual . Fire service: No strike but most staff are against increasing retirement from 55 to 61. The Prime Minister launched a fresh . attack on the strike, while business leaders warned it will have a . 'significant impact' on industry. David Cameron told MPs there was no . case for industrial action and repeated that the proposed changes to . public sector pensions were 'fair'. Speaking at Prime Minister's question . time, he said he hoped 'as many mums and dads as possible' would be . able to take their children to school despite the action. 'I don't believe there is any case for industrial action tomorrow, not least because talks are still ongoing. 'It is only a minority of unions who have taken the decision to go ahead and strike. 'What we are proposing is fair. It is . fair to taxpayers but it is also fair to the public sector because we . want to continue strong public sector pensions.' He also attacked Labour leader Ed . Miliband, who did not ask about the walkout, accusing him of being 'in . the pocket of the unions'. The British Chambers of Commerce said . disruption will lead to many parents having to take the day off work to . look after their children, losing them pay and hitting productivity. Paul Griffin of law firm DBS Paul . Griffin warned that workers could face disciplinary action if they take . time off to look after their children. Mr Cameron today echoed his feeling that the strikes were wrong at a time when negotiations were ongoing . He said: 'Anyone thinking of phoning . into the office tomorrow and claiming absence on the grounds of a . parental emergency could find themselves in hot water. 'Whilst parents are entitled to . unpaid time off to arrange childcare due to sickness or some other such . unpredictable event, these strikes have been known about for months. 'Employers could argue that this . situation does not qualify as an emergency and take disciplinary action . against individuals who don't turn up for work.' Picket lines will be mounted outside . school gates, courts, jobcentres, Parliament, driving test centres and . Government buildings by members of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), . Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), University and College . Union, and PCS. Negotiators: Len McCluskey of the Unite union and Mark Serwotka of PCS who warned of a security risk . Education Secretary Michael Gove has said that teachers wanting to strike could be forced to tell head teachers if they intend to strike. Many schools will close - up to 15,000 - because they don't know if they will have enough staff to provide adequate supervision. Schools are not allowed to close 'in sympathy' with strike action, but may be forced to as a result of the staff shortages. Mr Gove told the Commons that these rules would be reviewed as he urged schools to stay open with CRB checked parent volunteers. He said: 'I would far rather see schools stay open and offer a restricted curriculum than see hard-working families have to lose a day's pay themselves or have to pay for ad hoc and expensive last-minute childcare.' He added that it was 'regrettable' that two of the teaching unions were planning strike action which was 'unnecessary while talks were still going on'. 'It will cause massive inconvenience to hard-working families and it will hit working women particularly hard,' he said. Mr Gove has also written to head teachers asking them to keep schools open warning that strikes 'won't improve the prestige of the profession' an a column for The Sun today. He concluded: 'This Government won't allow strike action to derail our drive for a better future for our children.' Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'I understand why teachers are so angry with the Government. 'But I urge them to think about whether causing disruption in the classroom will help people understand their arguments.' Business Secretary Vince Cable said . he believed the public would find it difficult to understand why the . strike was going ahead when negotiations over pensions were continuing. It was 'imperative' that public . sector pensions were reformed, said Dr Cable, adding that he intended to . be in his office tomorrow and hoped that if any Business Department . staff went on strike it would not 'spoil' the working relationship. Mike Cherry, policy chairman of the . Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'Small firms are concerned about . the impact that the proposed strike action will have on their ability to . do business on Thursday. 'The recovery remains in a fragile . state and this action will have a wider impact on the economy as . businesses lose productivity - something the economy simply cannot . afford.' Airports have warned travellers to expect disruption on arrival into the UK as immigration and customs officers join the strike. Passengers have been advised to consider travelling on a different day to avoid delays as hundreds of staff walk out. A spokeswoman for Virgin Atlantic . said: 'Virgin Atlantic is working closely with the UK Border Agency to . support their contingency planning and minimise disruption to our . customers. 'We will keep our passengers informed of the situation through text messages, advice at check-in and onboard announcements.' High-speed Channel Tunnel train company Eurostar said it would not be affected by industrial action. It added that it was running two . extra trains tomorrow - one from London to Paris, the other from Paris . to London, to cope with expected extra demand. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, has written to headteachers across the capital urging them to keep their schools open. 'To close would cause considerable . inconvenience to working parents who will be forced to make alternative . childcare arrangements,' said the Evening Standard, quoting from his . letter. Disappointed: Francis Maude, left, and Danny Alexander said the talks . were 'constructive' but said they were unhappy the strike was going . ahead . A militant union is ‘bullying’ 100,000 school support staff into joining teachers in Thursday’s mass walkout – even though they have not voted to strike. Education Secretary Michael Gove has implored schools to remain open by any means possible, utilising an army of mothers and support staff. But yesterday it emerged the GMB – which is not involved in this round of strikes – is telling its members not to cross the picket line. The GMB represents some 100,000 non-teaching schools staff, from teaching assistants to dinner ladies, and caretakers to porters. It is illegal union members, other than those who have voted in favour of action, to strike. However, under guidelines from the Department for Business, non-striking staff are not obliged to cross a picket line. Meanwhile Unison, which represents 200,000 school support staff, has told its members not to cover the jobs of striking teachers. Their action will make it near-impossible for the majority of schools to remain open. 'It would also have a considerable . impact on those employers in the capital whose employees will need to . take leave to care for their children.' NUT leader Christine Blower said: . 'The action tomorrow is regrettable but unfortunately, due to the . position that the Government has taken, unavoidable. 'Teachers have been left with no . option but to demonstrate the strength of feeling they have about the . unnecessary proposals, which will see teachers paying more, working . longer and getting less for their pensions. 'The National Audit Office has confirmed that teachers' pensions are affordable. 'The Institute of Fiscal Studies has said all the evidence demonstrates that the costs of public sector pensions are falling. 'It is increasingly obvious that the Government is pressing ahead with changes on an ideological, not economic, argument.' Mr Serwotka urged union members to . ignore Government calls not to strike, adding: 'Thousands of jobs are at . stake, lower pensions are set to cost three times as much, and pay is . frozen while inflation soars. 'If you have never taken part in strike action before, make tomorrow's national action your first.'","All police leave in the capital cancelled .

"A high-performing primary school has missed out on Ofsted’s top grade after being judged too English. Pupils at the rural primary lacked ‘first-hand experience of the diverse make-up of modern British society’, declared the watchdog. However, around 97 per cent of the population in the town to which the school belongs are white. Middle Rasen Primary School in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, has missed out on an 'outstanding' rating from Ofsted because it is 'too English'. Pictured: Headteacher Melonie Brunton (back middle) with pupils . Inspectors penalised the 104-pupil school for not being multicultural enough, despite 97 per cent of the town being white and the majority of pupils not being from ethnic backgrounds . Ofsted refused it an ‘outstanding’ rating and graded it ‘good’ instead. It said the school was failing to do enough to ensure pupils understand the ‘cultural diversity of modern British society’ and experience ‘first-hand interaction with counterparts from different backgrounds’. But parents complained Middle Rasen Primary in Market Rasen was being punished for factors outside its control and had effectively been told it was ‘too English’. The row is the latest controversy over new rules on teaching ‘British values’ introduced in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal, in which Muslim extremists tried to infiltrate schools in Birmingham. Schools are required to ‘actively promote’ British values such as democracy, tolerance, mutual respect, individual liberty and the rule of law. However the rules – and Ofsted’s enforcement of them – have brought criticism from some schools and faith groups. A Christian school in Reading says it was warned it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies. In another case, a Roman Catholic school in East Anglia was marked down for failing to do enough to ‘teach students about the dangers of extremism and radicalisation’, although the report was later withdrawn. Head Melonie Brunton (left) said Ofsted's comments were a backlash against the so-called Trojan Horse plot, while Rev Charles Patrick (right), former head of governors, said town  did not have many non-white residents . The 104-pupil Middle Rasen Primary, in the town of Market Rasen on the edge of the Lincolnshire wolds, was inspected last month. Ofsted praised it for high standards of teaching and leadership and the courteous and enthusiastic behaviour of pupils. But the inspector said: ‘The large majority of pupils are White British. Very few are from other ethnic groups, and currently no pupils speak English as an additional language.’ It said the school should ‘extend pupils’ understanding of the cultural diversity of modern British society by creating opportunities for them to have first-hand interaction with their counterparts from different backgrounds’. Elsewhere, the small school had been highly praised in the report for its management and teaching, plus its well-behaved, courteous and enthusiastic pupils . Yesterday parents attacked the Ofsted decision. Mother-of-two Kirsty Egen, 29, said: ‘I think it’s ridiculous. It’s a brilliant school. ‘Why would the school spend time on trying to teach the children how to integrate with people who aren’t even there? It seems very vindictive to just mark them down for something they cannot change.’ Jodie Miller, 35, whose daughter Dylann, six, attends the school added: ‘We are a small rural community, there just aren’t many children here from different backgrounds.’ The town (pictured) is believed to be made up of about 97 per cent white residents, but the school was told that pupils should be more exposed to a range of different backgrounds . Julia Weeks, 47, who has a son of ten at the school, said: ‘To mark a school down for something they cannot control is crackers. If there were more people from ethnic minorities around then maybe you could have a complaint, but there just aren’t.’ Father-of-one Benjamin Bannan, 33, added: ‘It’s outrageous that a British school can he punished for being too British.’ Head teacher Melonie Brunton said the school was now looking to partner with an inner-city school in an effort to comply with Ofsted’s recommendation. ‘Ofsted are very keen on British values,’ she said. ‘We were very pleased to have got the very positive comments. We are a rural Lincolnshire school and that is always going to be an issue.’ Ofsted said: ‘We judged this school to be good across all areas, including teaching quality and pupils’ behaviour. All schools must teach pupils about fundamental British values.’ Jodie Miller, pictured with daughter Dylann, said it was 'bizarre' for Ofsted to 'punish' the school for being 'too English' Father-of-one Benjamin Bannan, 33, added: 'Its outrageous that a British school can be punished for being too British. It just doesn't make sense at all. 'We would welcome people from different cultures with open arms I'm sure - but there just aren't any ethnic minorities around here.' Ms Brunton said the school would look to look to partner with an inner-city school to develop their understanding of multicultural issues. She said: 'We would have liked to be 'outstanding' but we were very pleased to have got the very positive comments. 'We all worked really hard - everybody, the staff and the pupils have worked hard. 'I think the problem is that we are a rural Lincolnshire school and that is always going to be an issue. I agree that we could do more and we are trying to get a partnership with an inner city school.' The head said school trips usually involve visits to the countryside, such as farms and zoos. But they recently had a trip to Derby, which included a mosque visit as well as touring the Rolls-Royce factory. She added: 'We try to do things but not enough. I felt the Ofsted comments were a backlash against the Birmingham Trojan Horse issue and Ofsted are very keen on British values.' Reverend Charles Patrick, who was head of the governors at the time of the report, added: 'There is always more that you can do and maybe now we look at twinning the school with ones from other minority areas or something like that. 'But this is a rural area, like 80 per cent of the country, we don't have many non white residents. Perhaps it would be a different matter if we were in the middle of London or Manchester or something.' Tory MP for Gainsborough Sir Edward Leigh said: 'This is political correctness gone mad. 'Middle Rasen Primary School is an outstanding school by any standards, and Melonie Brunton is a brilliant headteacher - I back the school and its head one-hundred percent. 'Just last week I wrote to Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary, objecting strenuously to the new so-called 'equality' regulations she is implementing in schools. 'Conservatives have always stood for freeing our schools from the deadening hand of state-enforced orthodoxy. 'Why there has been such a massive U-turn under Nicky Morgan is inexplicable to me. 'Multiculturalism is an irrelevance in Lincolnshire with its low number of ethnic minorities, who are already welcomed and well-integrated into our local communities, as they should be.' A spokesman for Ofsted reiterated that it was not the only factor in depriving the school of its 'outstanding' rating. He said: 'We judged this school to be good across all areas including leadership and management, teaching quality, and pupils' behaviour and safety. 'All schools must teach pupils about fundamental British values including mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. 'That way they will be prepared for the future wherever they go.' According to the Office for National Statistics, the latest Census from 2011 shows the demographic of the 5,417 people living in Market Rasen is chiefly White British. Under the country of birth, the statistics show 5,165 were born in the UK. There were 90 people born in EU countries, with 29 born in Africa and 62 born in the Middle East and Asia. There were just 30 people born in the Americas and the Caribbean, while nine were born in Oceania. Under the category entitled 'ethnic group', 5,200 people were White British, while 23 were White Irish. There were 76 people under the category of White Other. There were just 16 residents of mixed white and black ethnicity, with 16 of mixed white and Asian ethnicity. There were 17 of Indian ethnicity and 19 of Chinese ethnicity. There were 22 of Black, African, Caribbean or Black British origin. In terms of main languages spoken, there were 5,246 people who classed English as their first language. Just 24 had another European language as their first language - including Romanian, Lithuanian, Greek, Swedish and Danish - while another 27 had their first language marked as an East Asian language.","Report said pupils at Middle Rasen Primary School in Lincolnshire lacked 'first-hand experience' of modern British society .

"Let me out: Ann Curry, pictured, is begging NBC bosses to let her out of her contract so she can accept a high-profile anchor job at CNN . Ann Curry is begging NBC bosses to let her out of her contract so she can accept a high-profile anchor job at CNN. Curry is reportedly earmarked for Anderson Cooper's coveted 8pm slot at the rival TV station by her former Today show boss, Jeff Zucker, who will take over as president of CNN Worldwide in February. If she quits without the green light from NBC, a clause in her contract bans her from working for any other news outlet. 'Ann wants out of her contract, big time,' a source close to the situation told RadarOnline. 'She has formally asked her attorney to explore exit options from the network.' But the website claims NBC bosses are unwilling to release Curry without a fight. 'If Ann were to just quit, there is a non-compete clause, which would prohibit her from working for another news outlet for two years,' the insider said. Zucker, previously executive producer at the Today show and one-time head of NBC Universal, wants to put Curry in the prime-time 8pm slot currently occupied by Anderson Cooper, RadarOnline reported. Curry's lawyers are arguing that her dramatic demotion from Today in April was in fact a breach of her contract terms by NBC. 'Ann's lawyer feels that there is a very strong case to be made that NBC has breached terms of the deal because Curry was demoted from Today,' the source told RadarOnline. 'Furthermore, Ann has basically been sequestered from appearing on the network. Yes, she has been doing some work that has been assigned to her, but it hasn't been steady.'

"Richard Johnson can see right through the masterpieces of Rembrandt and Van Gogh. The Cornell University electrical and computer engineering professor is a digital art detective, able to unlock the mysteries of a work's age and authenticity by analyzing its underlying canvas or paper. Using high-resolution X-ray images, the 64-year-old academic can actually determine if paintings came from the same bolt of hand-loomed canvas, each of which has a varying thread density pattern that can be as unique as a fingerprint. Linking multiple pieces of canvas to the same bolt can shore up arguments for authenticity and even put works in chronological order. Rembrandt's Self-Portrait Leaning on a Stone Sill at the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University: Richard Johnson, a Cornell University computer engineering professor, has developed a way to date and authenticate the centuries-old works by analysing X-ray images of the art . Professor Richard Johnson sits in room of the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art: Museums in the U.S. and Europe rely on his algorithm, which analyses thread densities and average thread counts in canvas and paper . It's a valuable service to world-class museums that comes through the unlikely cross-pollinating of traditional art history and contemporary computer science. 'By mixing the two groups we've been able to do more than either group had been able to do separately studying the paintings,' Prof Johnson said in a room full of Dutch paintings at Cornell's Johnson Museum. 'We're not trying to replace the art historian, we're trying to extend their reach.' Prof Johnson is a tech whiz and an art lover — the rare person able to speak with authority about Rembrandt's brush strokes and adaptive feedback systems theory. Although he didn't make his first visit to an art museum until he was a student on fellowship in Germany, the rooms full of Rembrandts left him thunderstruck. Notes from a previous dealer or collector are seen on the back of Rembrandt's etching, The Small Lion Hunt (with Two Lions): Professor Johnson's technique is an essential tool for judging a work's authenticity . Rembrandt's signature: Researchers have been conducting science-based analyses of artworks for some time. But it has become more common to use computers to analyse large amounts of digital data . Prof Johnson didn't make his first visit to an art museum until he was a student on fellowship in Germany . Andrew C. Weislogel, Curator of Earlier European and American Art at the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, with Prof Johnson outside the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY . Prof Johnson melded the two worlds in 2007 with a stint as an adjunct research fellow at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. He began examining high-resolution X-ray images of the canvases used by the 19th century master. Eventually, Prof Johnson and Rice University professor Don Johnson (no relation) developed digital 'weave density maps' of canvases that added computational power to what had been a painstaking process that required scholars to study small samples with magnifying glasses. 'It turns out with the eye, you make mistakes,' said Louis van Tilborgh, senior researcher at the Van Gogh museum. Mr Van Tilborgh sees the weave maps as an important tool in the ongoing work of precisely dating and ordering all of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings. The technique has also provided evidence to date Diego Velazquez's 'Sebastian de Morra.' A separate analysis of 24 Johannes Vermeer canvases supported the sometimes doubted attribution of one painting and provided fresh evidence to link two paintings at the National Gallery in London as complementary works. 'It's one more technical tool in the box of studying pictures,' said Walter Liedtke, curator of European paintings at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, who worked with Johnson on the Vermeers. 'You take this added evidence and you join it with — in the case of the two Vermeers in London —  pigment analysis, the iconography of the pictures, whether they were together in their history at earlier dates. ' Paper chain line patterns resembling stripes can be seen on the paper used by Rembrandt for his self-portrait when it is held against a window. Prof Johnson has switched his energies from canvas to paper recently . Clues: A watermark of a foolscap, upper right centre, is seen faintly on the etching The Small Lion Hunt . Researchers have been conducting science-based analyses of artworks for some time. But it has become more common to use computers to analyse large amounts of digital data. It's sometimes called computational art history and also includes assessing brushstrokes for distinctive patterns. Prof Johnson in recent years has left the canvas to other researchers as he focuses on paper. He's been analysing the old-fashioned paper used by Rembrandt for his prints, which was made by laying pulp on screens. Scholars know the dates when Rembrandt etched the copper plates to make the prints, but they are often less sure when an individual print was made. Was it one of the initial prints or did it come years later after the artist's death? Prof Johnson is using high-resolution digital images of Rembrandt prints owned by Cornell's museum to try to discern patterns that the screens impressed on the back of the prints. Separate prints cut from the same larger sheet of paper could be matched to provide the same sort of contextual information revealed by studying canvas. The details are different, but the idea of searching for useful patterns is the same, as is the idea of bridging the gap between art and tech. 'My philosophy all along has been to convince both sides that this is worth doing and they should be talking to each other,' Prof Johnson said.","Richard Johnson uses high-res X-rays to forensically examine canvases .

"First came rice powder and snail slime. Now, a new wave of Far Eastern beauty ingredients, including fermented porridge oats and coconut jelly, are set to appear on shelves. Among them is PiteraTM, a compound created during the sake (Japanese rice wine) fermentation process, which was discovered after scientists noticed that elderly brewery workers had extraordinarily soft, youthful hands. But the yeast compound, which has since been snapped up by skincare brand SK-II, is far from the only new 'wonder ingredient' to appear. Sake, oats and fermented herbs are among new 'miracle' ingredients appearing in beauty products from the Far East . Other Far Eastern cosmetics crazes  include powdered cleansers from Korea that turn into a creamy foam as soon as they come into contact with water, serum sheet masks made with coconut jelly or sea kelp, and fermented porridge oats and rice. The new beauty mists, which are being marketed in the UK and US by Glow Skincare, are also available with other fermented herbs and flowers including chrysanthemum and dandelion - said to help nourish and moisturise the skin. According to the brains behind the products, the fermentation process intensifies the nutrient content. It helps to  break down the ingredients, remove any toxins and absorb better into the skin. The fermented ingredients also act a natural preservative, so no extra chemicals are needed. Botanical mists made with an array fermented rice, oats, herbs and flowers (left) and serum sheet masks made of sea kelp are both currently in vogue in Korea . Jun-man Park, the CEO of Whamisa, an organic fermentation cosmetic brand, has been working with fermentation in skincare since 1992. He said:  'Fermentation is a metabolic process where carbohydrates and sugars are converted to skin-loving enzymes and amino acids via the growth of 'good' microorganisms like lactobacillus. 'While extensive research on fermentation in skincare is just starting, there are already studies that show the bio-availability of skin care products are increased when fermented, as ingredients are 'broken down' into smaller, more easily absorbed molecules. 'Fermentation also helps to increase the nutrient density and concentration of ingredients, by breaking down the molecular structure of ingredients - for example, wine has several times the antioxidant content of grapes. 'It also helps to preserve the effectiveness of active ingredients and allows for formulas to use fewer preservatives as fermentation removes 'bad bacteria'. Left: Skincare brand SK-II have incorporated PiteraTM into their luxury products Right: Cate Blanchett, 45, is the brand's ambassador . Asian cosmetics companies, which have pioneered high tech brightening ingredients and cleansing oils along with snail slime, are famous for creating unusual new products. And their efforts haven't gone unnoticed, with A-listers joining the ranks of Far Eastern product fans, among them SK-II ambassador, Cate Blanchett. The actress, 45, swears by the brand and says it is responsible for her 'radiant and clear' complexion. 'My skin has a radiance and clarity it didn't have 11 years ago, which is saying something,' she explains. 'When I first started using SK-II, I was so overwhelmed by the positive results it had – immediately, but then over the years, long-term results - I've become quite evangelical about it with my friends.'","Sake, oats and fermented herbs are among new 'miracle' ingredients .

"Critique: Damian Green said ministers have failed to discuss immigration . A minister has criticised the ‘failure of mainstream politics’ to discuss immigration as the Government launched a three-pronged crackdown on illegal migrants. Immigration Minister Damian Green said for years it had been ‘almost impolite’ for politicians to raise concerns about unprecedented numbers flowing into the UK, a silence which he said had allowed extremist parties, such as the BNP, to harvest votes. He spoke out as it emerged a university had become the first in the UK to be stripped of its right to educate foreign students. A UK Border Agency audit found numerous failings at London Metropolitan University, including allowing students to take lessons without valid visas and failing to report that some who had been granted visas, then failed to enrol on or attend courses. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May launched a drive to stop abuse of the UK’s marriage laws which have allowed migrants to stay here illegally. Ministers will change the rules so ceremonies can be delayed for investigations. Last year a vicar was jailed for staging 300 fake weddings - including couples who did not speak the same language. Mr Green said the silence around the UK’s doors being thrown open was filled by extremist parties such as the BNP, who then harvested votes from those who were concerned. Nearly 3.5million immigrants arrived in the UK during Labour’s 13 years in power between 1997 and 2010, with the tide increasing when ten former Soviet Bloc countries joined the European Union in 2004. Open borders: Mr Green said the immigration policies under Labour were too slack and insisted the coalition get to grips with the situation . Critics say public services, including schools, hospitals and transport, have struggled to cope with the influx, while some employers have been accused of using cheap, or illegal, foreign workers. In a radio interview with LBC Radio, Mr Green said immigration had been like ‘turning on a tap’ under Labour. He added: ‘On top of that, it was almost impolite to talk about immigration and the result of those two things happening at once was the rise of extremist politicians who scapegoated, really unpleasant parties like the BNP. ‘You saw that they rose at a time when politicians were afraid to talk about immigration so it’s very important that mainstream, moderate politicians of all parties actual deal with it as a problem.’ Home Secretary Theresa May wants to crack down on the abuse of UK marriage laws . He compared immigration under Labour to ‘an oil tanker steaming hard in the wrong direction’ but insisted the Government was ‘getting to grips’ with the issue. He spoke out as it emerged a controversial university had become the first in the country to be stripped of its right to educate foreign students. London Metropolitan University’s licence will be revoked after the Home Office branded it a ‘threat to immigration control’. Officials at the UK Border Agency identified so many failings at LMU, which has 2,600 students from outside the European Union, that it could not be trusted to ensure foreign students did not become illegal immigrants. An audit found the university allowed students to take lessons without valid visas to stay in Britain, did not report that some granted visas failed to enrol on or attend courses, and did not test students to check they could speak English. Malcolm Gillies, LMU’s vice-chancellor, said the university was ‘disappointed’ by the news. He said in the past six weeks the university had ‘done everything it could to demonstrate that it... has worked to remedy past weaknesses’. Mr Green said a national campaign to crackdown on foreigners who stayed in the UK after their student visas had expired had caught 2,000. Benefiting: The Immigration minister said that the silence on the immigration issue has led to extremist parties such as Nick Griffin's BNP gaining votes . He said: ‘We find that a lot of those are . people who came here on a student visa, maybe did study for a year or . maybe didn’t study at all, but they then hang around after their visa is . over and it’s clear that their main intention for coming here was to . work. That kind of abuse enrages people.' Mr Green said: ‘At the moment a registrar has the duty to marry someone if they can’t see any legal impediment then they have to marry them. ‘What we’re going to do is give the powers to say, “Actually I’m not going to marry you, because this doesn’t look like a proper marriage to me”.’ In the third prong of the crackdown, migrants who falsely claim benefits after coming to Britain to work, study or visit face being stripped of welfare payments, according to leaked documents. Nearly 20,000 people who arrived from outside Europe will be the first to be targeted in the new crackdown which will begin next month. They will receive a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) telling them to send back a photocopy of their passport or residence permit within 28 days, according to the Sunday Telegraph. If they cannot, they must email the UK Border Agency (UKBA) with a range of identifying information. In total, 370,000 people who came to Britain as visitors, students or workers are now on work-related benefits. Foreign-born claimants is understood to make up 6.5 per cent of the total 5.5 people on benefits in the UK.","Damian Green said it has been 'impolite' to discuss immigration .

"Police have issued a grovelling apology after they posted a Tweet with the words 'Officers 1 Immigrants 0' which was branded xenophobic and racist. Surrey Police were left red faced after they wrote the Tweet along with the hashtag 'We Will Catch Up With You' following an operation against illegal immigrants resulted in several people being detained. However within minutes of the posting, at 9.30pm on Thursday night, dozens of people had replied to the Guildford Beat police site, accusing them of being over the top. Offensive: The tweet was posted after a successful operation which saw several people detained . The original Tweet described how officers along with members of the UK Border Agency had carried out a raids at a mobile carwash in Sainsbury's in Burpham near Guildford, which resulted in eight people being detained. One user called Dan Maguire wrote: 'Just seen the @Guildford Beat tweet. They shouldn't be allowed on the streets let alone Twitter if that is the attitude they have.' Another user, Tim Travers wrote '@Guildford Beat institutional racism or institutional stupidity?' The Tweet was eventually removed as Surrey police posted a series of apologies which read: 'The language used in that tweet was inappropriate and has been removed. Apologies for any offence caused.' Another person who complained received a differently worded response which read: 'Apologies for any offence caused - wasn't the intention. Message used inappropriate language and has been removed.' In the joint operation at the Hands On Car Wash at Sainsbury's, workers from Uganda were questioned as to whether they had the right to work in the UK. Three men, aged between 32 and 37, and a 37-year-old woman were found to have overstayed their visas. Two men, aged 31 and 33, were working in breach of their visa conditions and a 31-year-old had entered the country illegally. Climbdown: Officers in charge of the force's Twitter feed apologised individually to those who took offence . A 45-year-old man was found to be an immigration offender. They were arrested and transferred to immigration detention pending removal from the country, apart from the men aged 32 and 33 who were placed on immigration bail while their cases are progressed. They will face removal from the country if found to have no leave to remain. The 45-year-old is still being questioned by immigration officers. Hands On Car Wash was served a notice warning that a civil penalty of up to £10,000 per illegal worker found will be imposed unless proof is provided that the correct right-to-work checks were carried out. This is a potential total fine of £80,000. Discipline: A spokesperson for Surrey Police said the officer who posted the tweet has been given 'advice' A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'Following a UK Border Agency led operation, supported by Surrey Police, in Guildford, the @GuildfordBeat Twitter account gave an update about the incident to members of the public. 'The language used in a subsequent tweet was inappropriate, it was quickly removed and an apology issued. 'Surrey Police will not tolerate language which is derogatory or discriminatory and the officer who sent the tweet has been given words of advice. 'It is important to stress that whilst the intention was to update the public about a successful intelligence-led operation the wording used does not reflect the views and values of Surrey Police.'","The tweet was posted on the Guildford force's account after a raid .

Natalie Herschforder, who co-curated the exhibit, describes Steichen as the 'Picasso of photography' and 'one of the top five photographers of all time'. However, he had a relatively unlikely rise to fame. In the early 1920s, Steichen was impoverished and traveled steerage from Paris, where he lived during World War I, back to his home country of the U.S. to find photography work to pay the alimony bills from his recent divorce. When he arrived in America he read an article in Vanity Fair describing him as 'America's greatest portrait photographer' and called the magazine for a job. Within a few weeks, he was travelling in style back to Paris with a first class ticket paid by the magazine to cover fashion week. For the rest of his career working for Vanity Fair and Vogue, Steichen made the equivalent of $1million by today's standards, in addition to another $1million in commercial work. However, Steichen got bored of the fashion work quite quickly, and resigned to focus on horticultural photography in 1935.

"An investigation has been launched after two illegal immigrants were deported from Italy gagged with duct tape across their mouths, surgical masks across their faces and their hands tied with plastic bands. Details of the case emerged after a passenger travelling on the same flight as the two men took a snap of the incident with his mobile phone as he boarded the plane. He asked police who were accompanying the Algerians why they were being treated in such a way. 'Scandalous treatment': One of the Algerian illegal immigrants sits on a deportation plane bound with duct tape and covered in a surgical mask on a flight from Rome to Tunis . Film director Francesco Sperandeo claimed the officers told him: 'Get back to your seat. This is just a routine deportation operation.' Astonished by what he had heard and the indifference of fellow passengers, he posted the photo on his Facebook site. Prosecutors opened an investigation into what had happened on the Alitalia flight from Rome to Tunis earlier this week after the story was picked up by the Italian media and splashed across several front pages as well as dominating TV news bulletins and websites. Police justified their actions saying the men had been biting their lips and tongues and spitting blood at officers and other passengers in an attempt to hold up the deportation. 'Warranted': Police justified their actions by saying the men had been biting their lips and spitting blood at officers and other passengers in an attempt to hold up the deportation . The incident happened after the men landed in Rome and then refused to board an onward flight they had booked to Istanbul. On his posting, Sperandeo, from Palermo, wrote: 'Look what happened today on the 9.20 Rome-Tunis Alitalia flight. 'Two Tunisians [he was unaware of their correct nationality] thrown out of Italy and treated in an inhuman manner. 'They had brown packing tape across their mouths and plastic bands on their wrists. This is civility and European democracy. Demands: Gianfranco Fini (pictured), president of the Italian lower house of parliament, has called on the government to fully investigate and explain what happened . 'But the most serious aspect is that everything took place to the total indifference of the passengers and when I asked for them to be treated more humanely I was told in an arrogant manner to get back to my seat as it was a normal police operation....Normal ???? 'Anyway I managed to take a picture. Spread the word and denounce this.' By late today, more than 5,000 people had shared the posting with hundreds of comments being posted both on his Facebook site and on the web pages of Italian newspapers, with many expressing outrage. MPs from all parties also called for the government to investigate. Gianfranco Fini, president of the Italian lower house of parliament, said: 'I ask the government to explain fully the circumstances of what happened.' He added that he had asked police chief Antonio Manganelli to look into the incident. Laura Boldrini, Rome-based spokesperson for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, said: 'This is scandalous treatment. It is humiliating and unjustified. 'I am completely speechless. I have never seen people treated like this in Italy. 'Those masks and that tape blocked out any word of protest. Can you imagine how those two people felt? 'It is correct that those who try and and enter the country illegally should be sent back, but this process should be carried out respectfully and under the proper procedures. In essence the only thing these two people are guilty of is seeking better life.' Although the majority of comments on Italian news websites were outraged at the treatment of the men, several also said that 'the full facts should be investigated before judgement is passed'. Another asked: 'Those people who expressing shock may well have had a different view if they were the ones being spat at.' Last month, a report by the Council of Europe - the human rights watchdog representing 47 European countries blamed failures by the Italian coastguard and NATO for failing to help rescue a boat packed with illegal immigrants which had been spotted in the Mediterranean and later sank with more than 60 people drowning.","MPs demand full investigation after passenger posts picture on Facebook .

"Lord Howell, father-in-law to the Chancellor George Osborne, told peers that Britain was pressing for a 'realistic and sustainable' solution to Greece's debt crisis, which he warned was having a 'chilling effect' on the British economy. He said 'uncertainty in Greece must be brought to an end... without utterly destroying that noble country'. A woman sweeps in front of a graffiti-covered wall in Athens, Greec,e after the riots over cuts demanded in return for a bailout . His comments came amid mounting fury in Athens at the draconian austerity measures demanded by Germany in return for a second £110 billion bailout by the 17-strong Eurozone. In an alarming development there were also fresh signs of economic 'contagion' in Europe, with unemployment in Spain topping five million as its economy went into reverse. Official figures showed Spain's economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year, with unemployment jumping by 400,000 to 5.3 million. Leading ratings agency Moody's added to the bleak outlook by threatening to downgrade more than 120 banks, including several major British institutions, because of concerns about the Eurozone. A mannequin of a child stands behind the damaged window of a fashion store in the centre of the capital as resentment grows over euro zone treatment of Greece . In a gloomy assessment the former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont described Greece as the 'canary in the mine' warning of the dangers ahead for the Eurozone. Lord Lamont said Greece was being forced to choose between the 'utterly impossible and utterly incredible'. He warned it now seemed a 'certainty' that Greece would be forced to leave the single currency, leaving the Eurozone facing a 'bleak future'. During angry exchanges in the Lords a UK Independence Party peer suggested that German economic policy recalled slogans used by the Nazis. Lord Willoughby said the German 'remedy' in Greece was 'austerity macht frei' - echoing the German phrase arbeit macht frei, meaning 'work sets you free'. The slogan was placed over the entrances to several Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz. Liberal Democrat Lord Teverson intervened on the UKIP peer to label the remark 'offensive'. The former Tory European commissioner Lord Tugendhat said Germany's overwhelming economic dominance following the crash was 'dangerous' for the EU. He said anti-German feeling was now 'rife in many European countries' - a development he described as 'very worrying and disturbing'. Anti-German feeling is running particularly high in Greece after Berlin's finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble suggested the country was becoming a 'bottomless pit'. Some other northern European countries are also now thought to favour Greece leaving the euro. Greece's 82-year-old president Karolos Papoulias, a veteran of Greece's resistance struggle against the Nazi occupation, hit back angrily on Wednesday night, saying: 'Who is Mr Schaeuble to insult Greece? Who are the Dutch? Who are the Finnish?' Despite the row there were tentative signs last night that the Eurozone was moving closer to agreeing a bailout deal for Greece. Employees of the Labour Housing Organisation shout slogans during a protest outside the Labour Ministry in Athens today . Some senior officials suggested a deal could be struck as early as Monday. But it remained unclear whether the deal will amount to more than a temporary fix, with a final package delayed until after the Greek elections expected in April. European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso yesterday sought to soothe tensions with Greece by praising the country's attempt to deal with an economy in freefall. Mr Barroso said: 'I would like to salute the courage of the Greek government and the Greek people in these very demanding, challenging times. Today's market: The FTSE rose today despite the turmoil in Europe . 'And I would hope that the member states, the members of the European Union will accept the commitments given by Greece.' But several European capitals retain severe doubts about whether Greece is willing or able to impose the level of cuts needed to tackle its debts and remain within the euro. In one small symbol of the scale of the challenge facing Greece it was reported yesterday that virtually every traffic light in central Athens was smashed during anti-austerity riots at the weekend. But the transport department is so strapped for cash that it cannot afford to replace them, leaving to disastrous congestion in the Greek capital. 'I am not sure even now whether all . in the political parties in Greece are aware of their responsibility for . the difficult situation of their country.' That prompted a furious response from Greek President Karolos Papoulias, an 82-year-old veteran of the resistance to Nazi occupation of Greece during World War Two, who lashed out at German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. Schaeuble, who has likened Greece to a 'a bottomless pit', expressed doubt on Wednesday whether Athens would stick to new promises adopted by parliament on Monday as rioters torched and looted buildings across the capital. 'I cannot accept Mr Schaeuble insulting my country,' Papoulias riposted. 'Who is Mr Schaeuble to insult Greece? Who are the Dutch? Who are the Finnish?' 'Schaeuble Junta', ran a headline in the conservative Eleftheros Typos newspaper, harking back to Greece's painful spell under military rule during the 1960s and 1970s. Other Greek newspapers ran banners readeing 'In the gas chamber' and What the Germans want'.

The banking sector faces being broken up unless it shows a ‘step change’ in competition, the head of the Office of Fair Trading warned today. In a speech to bankers, John Fingleton said banks must provide the ‘right prompts’ to help customers decide whether or not they should switch account provider. The issue of bank account switching was flagged last year by the Independent Commission on Banking, which made several recommendations designed to make switching accounts more easy for customers. Mr Fingleton said: ‘It is not enough to make it easy to switch. Customers also need the right prompts to exercise their choice of provider.‘In banking markets consumers frequently face difficulties in understanding the true cost of running their account and comparing deals from alternative providers.’ He said the sector was at a ‘turning point’ with the emergence of new banks such as Virgin Money, Metro Bank and Tesco but said if ‘real change’ is not seen, a ‘radical approach’ must be considered. The OFT chief executive said he was prepared to hand the sector over to the Competition Commission and warned the industry could face the same outcome as airports operator BAA - a forced break-up. As uncertainty lingers, investors are . reassessing their assumption that Greece will get the money, prompting . big market movements today. While the euro slipped by 0.5 per . cent to below $1.30, stocks across Europe fell, with Italy's main market . underperforming its peers, trading down 1.9 per cent. Meanwhile, the yield on Italy's . ten-year bond has risen by 0.18 percentage points to 5.81 per cent while . Spain's rate has risen another 0.07 percentage points to 5.46 per cent, . a little down from earlier.

"A horse racing fan who was so excited at seeing his horse heading to victory that he ran out after it to cheer it on was run over and killed by the horse travelling behind. Malte 'The Twin' Velasquez, 49, vanished almost instantly as he was hit at high speed by the horse and rider. Eyewitness Davor Avalos, 38, said: 'I couldn't believe it, one minute he was standing there and the next second he was gone. It was like he was hit by a juggernaut, it was clear he didn't have a chance.' Moments before tragedy: Malte Velasquez ran onto a race track in Mexico when the horse he backed came home first . Racehorses can easily hit speeds of up to 40 mph at the track in Paraiso, in the south-eastern Mexican state of Tabasco. Friends of the dead man said he had gambled money on the horse and when he saw it was getting near to taking pole position, after coming from quite far back in the pack, he ran out to shout encouragement, and did not look behind him. Medics said he had died as a result of multiple injuries including a broken neck on the way to hospital. Too late: Mr Velasquez didn't realise that another horse was galloping to the finish line behind the one he'd backed to win . Brutal: Mr Velasquez was killed after the horse behind hit him 'like a juggernaut' Officials are now probing safety standards at the track after it was revealed in local media that the organisers could not hire security teams which had meant that many people had ended up standing on the racetrack putting their lives at risk. A police spokesman said: 'From the video footage we have seized, it seems as if the whole place was one big accident waiting to happen.' The dead man was married with two children.","Malte Velasquez died after being hit by a horse at a race in Mexico .

"A motorbike hurtles towards me, a man carrying a goat perched pillion. I leap out of the way just in time and hear the warning cry - ‘Balak! Balak!’ - as two young men on bicycles heading in the opposite direction swerve around me and disappear into the throng. On my right, silk, silver and spice sellers jostle with leather-workers and wood carvers; on my left people queue to buy boiled sheep’s brains. Musky aromas emanate from herboristas to compete with the smell of citrus, mint, cedarwood - and the odd whiff of drains. Just desert: The Sahara Desert tour was an evening excursion which involved riding dromedaries (resting in the distance) into the 450 foot high Erg Chebbi dunes to watch the sun go down. Thunderstorm optional . The word 'bustling' could have been invented to describe the souks of Morocco. And nowhere does it seem more appropriate than here in the medina of Fes, where human life exists in all shades, from poverty to splendour. The winding passages - full of shops, locals, tourists, saucepans, mirrors, wedding dresses, children selling packs of tissues, and the odd lost kitten - seem even more vibrant than in the fabled market of Marrakech, which I passed through two days earlier. Is it really only 48 hours since I landed in north Africa? It feels a lifetime ago. Archers has been offering mainstream and specialist holidays to destinations across the planet for 50 years. Its 10-night ’Highlights of Morocco’ package is a firm favourite - and the itinerary is exhaustive. Our tour director Ann - a resident of the country for 35 years, having arrived as young rep – is a font of information, and has links with local businesses and guides all over the country. The group I am travelling with could not be described as young. Pensioners with a yearning for adventure dominate this inquisitive army of 36 adventure-seekers - from the UK, Canada, Australia and the US. My travelling companion and I are soon rather sweetly dubbed ‘the girls’. Alliances and unlikely friendships are formed, and we swap contact details with people we would never have expected to meet before the trip. The medina in Fes (left) was a real eye-opener, teeming with life - in contrast to the tranquillity found in former palace gardens like this one in Meknes (right), which was made even more colourful by the local guide . It does not take long to see why former King Hassan II described his country as having ‘one foot in Africa, the other in Europe’. Morocco is a vast and varied territory that was only united into a modern nation state in 1956. The rise and fall of powerful dynasties and mighty empires - a recurring pattern in its colourful history - has resulted in a melting pot of tribes, and a multi-faith society. While Arabic and French is spoken by the majority, a large number of people are descended from the ancient Berbers (or Amaziah), who have preserved their own languages and customs. Our tour is a 1,000-mile (1,700 km) round trip which takes in the labyrinthine walled cities of Marrakech, Casablanca, Rabat and Fes. Roman ruins, ornate mosques, kasbahs and palaces with beautiful tiled courtyards are all part of our progress. Snow-capped mountains, vast barren plains and deep gorges feature heavily as we continue our journey. Although I am unconvinced about the prospect of lengthy stints on a coach, I soon find that this is a good way of getting under the skin of a country - each day offering a totally different experience. From the urban sprawl of Casablanca we travel to the historic city of Meknes - where, during a tour of the former royal stables and granaries, our local guide paints a colourful picture of the bloodthirsty 17th century megalomaniac Sultan Moulay Ismail, who was rumoured to have sired 1,000 children. Catherine and Jane chill out in a shepherd family's tent in the desert (left), but say no to the mint tea... Right, camels woven from palm trees are sold at the side of the road by young boys to boost the family income . Then we journey through vast red plains, past the occasional solitary goatherd or flock of camels, to the ancient city of Fes. After a couple of days there – the chaotic medina being an obvious highlight - we travel south, through the curiously Swiss-like chalet town of Ifrane, where the privileged go to ski. Then we wind through the Atlas Mountains and the spectacular Ziz Valley - a slash of green in the barren landscape, with more than a million trees. We end up in Erfoud, an oasis town on the edge of the mighty Sahara Desert. King Mohammed VI, who began his rule in 1999 when his father Hassan II died, has brought a (relative) wave of democracy and modernity to the country. A massive road building programme (with solar-powered street lights in places) has been implemented to improve the movement of Morocco’s rural population - while the inevitable increase in tourism is mirrored by a growing number of golf courses and shopping malls. Thankfully (for us anyway) there are still few modern features in the south, and an extraordinary experience in the Sahara Desert tour proves to be my favourite moment of the entire tour. From our haven of a hotel in Erfoud, a fleet of four-by-fours whizzes us into the desert. An hour later, we are removing our shoes outside a Berber shepherd’s tent, although (pre-warned by Ann that the ‘furry bag’ the water is stored in is in fact a goat’s carcass) we politely turn down the offer of mint tea. The next leg of our trek into the 450ft-high Erg Chebbi dunes is on a different type of 4x4 entirely. Atop my own personal dromedary I drink in the sight of the vast orange sands curving ahead of us, the line of majestic camels silhouetted against the sky. There is no sound except the occasional grunt of a camel, or call from one of the men, and an expectant hush descends as we sit in a line along the sharp edge of a dune, to watch the sunset. Suddenly, thunder rumbles and a flash of lighting cracks the sky. The sand turns red as the heavens open, and our camel drivers scurry to cover us in blankets. A thunderstorm in the desert! I feel blessed to experience such an incredible sight. Our tour ends where it began - in exotic Marrakech, with its extravagant architecture and busy squares and markets. Lights up: Snake charmers, musicians and acrobats appear every night in the main square in Marrakech . As dusk falls on the Djemaa el-Fna square, stallholders scramble to set up their mobile restaurants, the light provided by bare bulbs hooked up to gas cylinders. We descend from the rooftop terrace where we have been watching the scene unfold, and sit at one of the food stalls - where we enjoy freshly fried calamari, salads and flatbreads with fiery dips, and aubergine cooked to perfection. Families huddle in circles around flickering coloured lanterns, and men selling gaudy toys shout for custom - amid snake charmers, musicians, acrobats and storytellers. It is a magical scene. But I can't help drifting back to that sand dune, lightning flickering above me - an experience that touched my soul.

"Britain’s ‘universal postal service’ is under threat because of the growing popularity of sending packages on Amazon, it has been revealed. Royal Mail, which is legally obliged to deliver post and packages anywhere in the UK for the same price, has seen its profits slump after Amazon shook up the parcels market by setting up its own delivery network. Moya Greene, the Royal Mail chief, today demanded ministers overhaul rules which allow other companies to ‘cherry pick’ cheaper letter deliveries around big cities, leaving expensive rural post to the national service. Royal Mail's shares plummeted to £3.30 today - a fall of 8 per cent - following news that profits had dropped by £70 million . She said an urgent change in the rules was needed to ‘secure the sustainable provision of the universal service for the future’. It comes after Royal Mail shares plummeted by 8 per cent – after profits fell from £353 million to £279 million. The Communication Workers Union, representing Royal Mail workers, said the drop in profits was directly linked to the Government’s decision to privatise the service. Deputy general secretary Dave Ward warned that unrestricted competition in the postal sector would make it difficult for Royal Mail to sustain its duty to deliver the universal service obligation in the coming years. He added: 'We need Ofcom to perform its primary statutory duty by urgently reviewing the threat competition poses to the universal postal service. 'We'd like to see a cap put on competition to Royal Mail. The results today are proof that direct delivery competition is damaging the financial sustainability of the universal postal service.' When Royal Mail was part-privatised last year the Business Secretary Vince Cable insisted it was the only way to protect the universal delivery service. Royal Mail is being forced to fight harder for business, with competition from the likes of TNT, Yodel, and Amazon itself hampering progress. Business Secretary Vince Cable said privatising the Royal Mail would help protect the universal service . The firm said Amazon's plans would slash the rate of growth in the UK parcels market from 4-5 per cent to 1-2 per cent a year for its own business and other carriers for around two years. Parcels make up half of Royal Mail's turnover and its growth in an industry buoyed by online shopping is a key investment focus for shareholders in light of declining letter volumes. The company reported a rise in parcel volumes of 2 per cent in the six months to September 2, but the division's revenues fell 1 per cent in what was described as a 'highly competitive' marketplace. Across the group, pre-tax profits were £218million in the period, compared with £233million a year earlier. Royal Mail is legally required to deliver anywhere in the UK for the same price . Operating profit before 'transformation costs' fell by 21 per cent to £279million, as Amazon's delivery ambitions, higher pension costs and the absence of a VAT refund received a year ago all took their toll. The figure was at the top end of a forecast range of £237-279million, but the City gave Royal Mail's results a negative reception this morning. The stock initially posted gains before dropping 5 per cent or 22.65p to 446.55p. Royal Mail was floated by the Government at 330p in October 2013 and soared to a peak of 618p within months, sparking fierce controversy over whether the business had been undervalued at the outset. Today, Royal Mail reported a a 2 per cent rise in group revenue to £4.53billion, while operating profit margins rose up by 0.2 percentage points to 6.2 per cent. Addressed letter volumes fell by 3 per cent but this was better than expected due to the improvement in economic conditions. Letter revenues increased by 1 per cent to £2.24billion as a result of price increases and an uplift from elections mail. In the first half of the year, Royal Mail delivered around 200million candidate mailings, mainly due to European and local government elections in May. For the Scottish independence referendum, the company said it delivered over seven million campaign mailings and over five million poll cards. Royal Mail is now targeting higher growth areas, such as clothing and footwear, in an effort to attract more parcels business from larger retailers. As the UK's 'universal service' provider, Royal Mail is required to provide access to competitors such as TNT for final mile deliveries. Postal regulator Ofcom is investigating a complaint from TNT over Royal Mail's decision to change conditions and increase the prices it charges to deliver post collected and pre-sorted by its competitors.","Royal Mail is obliged to deliver post  anywhere in the UK for the same price .

"A lingerie advert has been banned from Australian television by censors for being too sexist. The Advertising Standards Board upheld a complaint about it being in poor taste. The clip features a woman in underwear walking into a garage to ask a worker behind the counter 'can you fit me?' Scroll down for video . Taken down: A lingerie advert has been banned from Australian television by censors for being too sexist . Created by Crisp Advertising in North Adelaide, its message was designed to convey that Innerware Lingerie offered free bra fittings. But the board ruled that the content breached a section of the advertising standards code which stipulates that 'advertising or marketing communications shall treat sex, sexuality and nudity with sensitivity to the relevant audience,' reported The Australian.

Last year a car advert featuring scantily-clad burlesque dancers was banned after watchdogs branded it sexist. They were concerned that it featured ‘a number of shots of the women’s breasts and bottoms, in which their heads were obscured’. The way the women had been presented in the Renault Clio advert ‘invited viewers to see them as sexual objects’, it was ruled. The Advertising Standards Authority, who were alerted by just one complaint, banned the advert – which appears only on the internet – after rejecting the French car-maker’s contention that it was a parody of a typically French Moulin Rouge-style cabaret scene. They ruled it was ‘sexually provocative’ and ‘objectified the dancers by portraying them as sexual objects’.","Advertising Standards Board upheld a complaint about it being in poor taste .

"As technology slowly but surely takes over our daily lives - it's refreshing to know that good old-fashioned calendars are still a big stocking filler as Aussies continue to purchase more than 2 million every year. For the year that will be 2015 - the predicted Top 10 calendar list has everything from movies, TV shows, musicians to the out-there themes of Cow Yoga and Ford cars - and even the practical buy of a Mum's Family calendar. It's no surprise that Game of Thrones is a winner with Aussies downloading the medieval blockbuster more than anyone else across the globe. Scroll down for video . Namaste: This calendar depicting cows in various yoga poses is predicted to be one of the top 10 bestselling calendars in 2015 . Swift sales: Could Taylor Swift's 2015 calendar sales rival those of her new album, 1989? It's no surprise that the Game of Thrones calendar is expected to be a hit amongst Australians, as Aussies download the hit show more than anyone else across the globe . The other TV shows that make the list are the British resurgence of Doctor Who and the American horror series The Walking Dead. The massive Disney smash hit Frozen was always going to make the list with million of kids obsessed with the animated film. While one of the most famous bands in the world, The Beatles, might have split up more than 40 years ago - it remains a big seller with Aussies as does the Liverpool Football Club calendar. Popular American country pop star Taylor Swift has also made it onto the Top 10 biggest expected calendar buys. Calendar Club head buyer Sarah Bartlett said each year there are the classics with a few surprises thrown in the mix. They may not be on top of the EPL ladder, but Liverpool FC can take comfort in being a predicted calendar hit .

'Last year Underwater Dogs took everyone by surprise – who knew underwater photos of dogs would be one of our biggest sellers. Sugar Skulls was also enormously popular, and we had to re-print the first ever Peppa Pig calendar,' Calendar Club head buyer, Sarah Bartlett said. 'Then there are the perennial favourites. Aboriginal art is always popular. Liverpool FC always outsells other football codes and clubs, even Collingwood, and bands like The Beatles just keep on selling, year after year.' After 52 years and 13 different incarnations of Dr Who, a 16-month calendar was necessary as the usual 12 months was just not enough . Ms Bartlett said people still enjoy the low-tech nature of the traditional calendar. 'It acts as a central point for the whole household, covering off holidays, social occasions, birthdays, appointments and more,' she said. 'With a simple glance, you can see what's happening across the entire month… no need to sync everything or worry about the computer crashing.' The calendar for the AMC's hit series The Walking Dead is certain to feature plenty of gore .

"The immigration boom under Labour led to the face of Britain changing faster than any major nation except Italy, a study by an Oxford University think tank revealed. During the five-year peak of the influx, the UK’s migrant population soared by 22 per cent – double the average of G8 countries, figures from the Migration Observatory show. Over the past two decades, Britain’s foreign-born population has increased from 3.8million – or 7 per cent of the total population - in 1993 to almost 7million, or 12 per cent per cent in 2010. Changing faces: Britain has become increasingly multicultural in the past two decades. The number of immigrants in the country rose by 22% in five peak years between 2000 and 2005 . During the same period, the number of foreign-born residents without British citizenship doubled from just under two million (4 per cent of the population) to over four million (7 per cent). Net-migration – the number arrivals minus those leaving - increased from 564,000 during the five years from 1996-2000, to 923,000 in 2001-2005 and 1,044,000 during 2006-2010. In 2010, net-migration reached 252,000, its highest level for a single calendar year on record. But it is the period between 2000 and 2005 – a period of an open border policy during and rapid  expansion of the EU - that immigration really spiked. Leap: The graph shows migration soared by 22% in Britain between 2000 and 2005. Only Italy saw its foreign-born population rise faster (44.6%). France's rose only by 3.2% during the same period . Ahead: Britain's immigrant growth rate has remained above the averages of the original 15 EU member states, the G8 group of major industrial nations and the world for most of the last decade . Only Italy, which experienced a 44.6 per cent rise in immigration, saw a higher rate in the developed world. But, . after more restrictions were introduced in 2005, the growth rate of the . migrant population in the UK was just over 10 per cent. It was still higher than the G8 . average – but somewhat lower than 14 per cent rate of the 15 EU . countries that existed prior to 2004. This group – with 21.4 per cent rise - had only a slightly lower level of immigration growth that the UK between 2000 and 2005. Queues: People in lines for European Passport holders at Heathrow. Relaxed immigration rules and an expansion of the EU mean that the number of people entitled to live in the UK has rocketed over the last two decades . Although, experts believe Italy’s enormous spike has skewed these figures. Criticism: Alp Mehmet, from MigrationWatch, said Jamie Oliver is 'simply wrong' about British workers . For . example, France saw only a 3.4 per cent rise in immigration during the . period, according to data obtained by the United Nations. Russia's immigration growth rose only by 1.6 per cent. Figures . also show that as the global population has increased considerably in . the last two decades, so too has the number of international migrants. The number has increased from 156million in 1990 to 214million in 2010. The comparison with G8 countries compares other high-income nations this group, which also includes Russia, Italy, France, Canada, the U.S. Germany and Japan. For all the G8 countries, with the exception of Japan, migrants are defined as foreign-born residents in the data. In the data for Japan, migrants are defined as foreign citizens. Alp Mehmet, of pressure group Migration Watch, told Mail Online: ‘This underlines what we have been saying about Labour’s mass immigration policy. ‘It also shows why it will be so difficult to get immigration back down to sensible levels’","Immigrant population soared by 22% during Labour's open door policy .

"New research suggests that aspirin may not have any heart-health benefits for older people who long believed a small daily dose of the drug might prevent heart attacks and stokes. Using a pool of more than 14,000 Japanese people ages 60 to 85, researches saw no major differences in heart-related deaths and strokes between those regularly taking aspirin and those who didn't bother. However, the study's authors caution people to talk to their doctors before leaving their pills behind. New research suggests that aspirin may not have any heart-health benefits for older people who long believed a small daily dose of the drug might prevent heart attacks and stokes . 'Patients need to discuss this with their doctor, because I think it's difficult to do that calculation of benefit and risk without consulting a health care professional,' said Dr. Michael Gaziano, a Harvard Medical School professor who co-authored commentary on the study, tells CBS News. He suspects that due to the differences between Japanese and American populations, there is little chance the study will have lasting impacts on aspirin use in the U.S. The study was performed by doctors randomly prescribing low-doses of aspirin to older patients who suffered from high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes and tracking those who experienced health problems compared to people not taking the drug. The patients were tracked on an average of 5 years. The study's co-author, Dr. Kazuyuki Shimada, of the University of Shin-Oyama City Hospital in Japan, presented the findings Monday in Chicago at the American Heart Association's annual meeting. Doctors suspect that due to the differences between Japanese and American populations, there is little chance the study will have lasting impacts on aspirin use in the U.S. 'It indicates that primary prevention with daily low-dose aspirin does not reduce the combined risk in this population,' he tells CBS News. During his presentation he added that: 'the possibility that aspirin does have a beneficial effect cannot be excluded,' as the trial ended earlier than anticipated due to the low number of heart attacks or strokes. People who avoided aspirin were more likely to experience 'mini-strokes' and chest pains but people using aspiring were more likely to have dangerous bleeding. Those that have a high risk of heart problems could still benefit. 'For all those people, they should take aspirin for the long haul, because the benefits outweigh the risk,' Gaziano said. 'But if you're very low risk, the benefits of aspirin likely don't outweigh the risk.'","Study was done over 5 years with more than 14,000 Japanese people ages 60 to 85 .

"A family of five murdered two men and dissolved their bodies in acid baths at home - before flushing the leftover 'sludge' down the lavatory. Police said the family are from Holland but used the house in Germany as a 'chop shop' to dispose of their victims, who they killed with an icepick and a semi-automatic gun. An international manhunt is now underway after two of the killers went on the run in South America. Grisly: Alan Gergeri, left, was killed with an icepick while Mohammed al Jader, right, was cut down in a hail of bullets last year, allegedly for trying to blackmail the family. Their bodies were dissolved in acid . The horror house was only uncovered after neighbours complained of a 'peculiar' smell coming from the property in Tuddern, in Germany. And police have not ruled out the . possibility that there are more victims as they collect human remains . from the sewerage system of the small town.

The second man, Mohammed al Jader, 29, was cut down in a hail of bullets last year, allegedly for trying to blackmail the family. The Dutch family from the town of Sittard in Limburg owned the horror-house in Germany and used it as the 'chop shop,' said police, where bodies were cut up and laid in the hydrochloric acid vats. One police officer said; 'The house was a terrible sight.  Bone fragments and a green gloop were found at the bottom of these vast vats that were filled with acid. 'Fingers and feet bones have been found a mile away in the sewers.'  Gas masks were found in the house - used by the family as they poured the acid from barrels into the decomposing tanks.' Hydrochloric acid is highly corrosive and in a highly diluted form is found in many household cleaners. Some 20 million tonnes of it are produced annually around the world. A unique cross-border forensics operation is underway between Dutch, German and Belgian police that continues while Interpol scours for the missing family members who are thought to be in Venezuela.

"The body of a hot-air balloonist who saved the lives . of five skydivers before his balloon went down in a thunderstorm was found today in dense woodland. A search team in a helicopter spotted the balloon before crew on the ground discovered the body of 63-year-old Edward Ristaino. Mr Ristaino had been taking five . skydivers into the air during a festival in Fitzgerald, Georgia, when . stormy weather swiftly moved in. Missing: Ho-air balloonist Edward Ristaino saved the lives of five skydivers before his balloon went down in a thunderstorm in south Georgia on Friday . The balloon was found about seven to eight miles east of Fitzgerald, according to Ben Hill County Sheriff Bobby McLemore. It was draped over the basket containing Mr Ristaino's body in a heavily wooded area. A fast-developing thunderstorm sucked in Mr Ristaino's balloon while he was ferrying skydivers on Friday, then sent the craft plummeting toward the ground. The skydivers parachuted to safety and landed without injury. Authorities had used helicopters, airplanes, horses and all-terrain vehicles to search the woods in south Georgia for the 63-year-old. Two of the skydivers said he had kept them safe by spotting a field where they could safely parachute and telling them to jump as the storm approached. Search: Rescue workers coordinate looking for Mr Ristaino in thick Georgia woodland . Skydiver Dan Eaton said: 'If we would have left a minute later, we would have been sucked into the storm.' He added that Mr Ristaino's choice to embark on the trip was not reckless. The team took off into a blue sky from the festival. From the air, they could see only a fog-like haze that later turned into a fierce thunderstorm. Strong winds forced the balloon up to . about 18,000ft before it collapsed in a downdraft and plummeted to the . ground at about 2,000ft per minute, police said. The storm 'came out of nowhere,' said fellow skydiver Jessica Wesnofske. Mr Ristaino, from Cornelius, North Carolina, managed to direct the balloon over a field and then told the skydivers to jump before it crashed. The hot-air balloonist, who had 15 years experience and founded the Lake Norman Balloon Co, had no parachute. Discovery: A helicopter crew spotted Mr Ristaino's balloon in dense woodland today . Experienced: Mr Ristaino's balloon Norman The Sea Serpent, pictured at the 2005 Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta . Miss Wesnofske's father Brian, 55, was also one of the skydivers who parachuted to safety. He said that when they launched the balloon at 6pm on Friday the weather was perfect. Mr Ristaino noticed a haze the distance as the balloon reached about 4,500ft but it was impossible to tell it was a storm until it was too late, Mr Wesnofske said. Sheriff McLemore said Mr Ristaino was reading off the altitude readings as he fell, in what authorities believe was an attempt to help pinpoint a search effort. He said: 'Mr Ristaino had just made the statement that ""I'm at 2,000ft and I see trees"" and that was his last transmission.' Erin Daly, whose brother was one of the skydivers, called Mr Ristaino a hero who saved five lives.","Edward Ristaino, 63, hailed as a hero for helping parachutists escape storm .

"Manchester United were forced to issue an ‘unreserved’ apology last night after using a swastika-style logo in a newsletter to fans. The Premier League champions published the black and red image in an email sent to millions of supporters worldwide. It featured the headline ‘New Order’ - a play on the Manchester band with the same name - which was used alongside images of the team’s emerging youth players, including Adnan Januzaj, David de Gea and Danny Welbeck. Manchester United issued an 'unreserved apology' after using a swastika-style logo in this newsletter . But the term is also linked to Nazism because of Adolf Hitler’s call in 1941 for a New Order in Europe and caused widespread outrage among fans who received the United Uncovered e-mail. Many took to Twitter, prompting the club’s head of media, David Sternberg, to tweet an apology. He said an internal investigation had been launched into how the email was cleared for publication. ‘The creative is completely inappropriate,’ he said. ‘We apologise unreservedly and are taking appropriate internal action.’ When contacted by supporters demanding to know why the image, which spelt out the letters in MUFC, had been distributed, Mr Sternberg replied: ‘That’s what is being investigated - obviously it shouldn’t have.’ Senior figures at Old Trafford were described as being ‘taken aback’ by the incident. Fan David Hills tweeted: ‘I’ve been a supporter for a long, long time, and I’m disgusted by what I’ve just seen. 'To send out a logo which by itself looks like a swastika - and then accompany it with the words New Order - is shocking. I hope somebody gets the sack.’ Manchester United said the title related to the Manchester band New Order, and issued an ‘unreserved apology’ for any offence, which was ‘entirely unintended’. ‘While the headline was intended to reference the band of the same name, it has been pointed out that the graphic had design similarities to a swastika which, combined with other connotations of the phrase ‘new order’, has caused offence which was entirely unintended,’ a spokesman said. ‘For this, United Uncovered unreservedly apologises.’ Senior figures at Old Trafford (stadium pictured) were described as being 'taken aback' by the incident . The gaffe emerged as the Duke of Cambridge told the Football Association that racism is still a problem in the game. Speaking at a dinner at the Grand Connaught Rooms, central London, to celebrate 150 years of the FA on Saturday, Prince William said: ‘There is sadly more work to do, but it is heartening to see how seriously the FA takes stamping the blight of racism and discrimination out of football.’ Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich, who subsequently joined Manchester United, was fined £1,000 by the Football Association in 1996 for delivering a ‘Nazi’ salute to Tottenham Hotspur supporters during a Premier League game in which he was playing for Aston Villa at White Hart Lane. Spurs have a large Jewish following and this season have been at the centre of another race-related furore involving the word ‘Yid’ which was banned from being used by any fans at their matches. The derogatory term has been adopted by their supporters as a defence mechanism, with chants of ‘Yiddos’ or ‘Come on you Yids’ being regularly heard at White Hart Lane. One fan was warned and another arrested earlier this month after refusing police requests to cease the chanting during a match.","Football club published black and red image in email sent to millions of fans .

"A man who was sentenced to die yesterday, is now under investigation for five more capital crimes in a different state. A Pennsylvania jury deliberated for seven hours on Tuesday, before coming to the decision to send 40-year-old Charles Ray Hicks to death row for the January 2008 murder of Scranton woman Deanna Null, 36. Prosecutors said Hicks beheaded Null alive, before chopping up the rest of her body and dumping the remains in black bags scattered along  interstate roads. The remains were recovered by investigators, who also found Null's severed hands hidden in the walls of Hicks' Tobyhanna home. On Monday, the day before he was sentenced, Hicks allegedly confessed to murdering five more women in Texas before he moved to Pennsylvania, prosecutor Michael Mancuso said. Hicks is originally from Fort Worth. Scroll down for video . Going to death row: Charles Hicks, 40, is seen leaving court on Tuesday after receiving the death penalty for the January 2008 murder of 36-year-old Deanna Null . 'As I understand it, yesterday he made certain admissions that he killed some women down there,' Mancuso said. 'And that's going to also be investigated and may result in charges.' Both Pennsylvania and Texas have the death penalty, but Texas follows through on executing their death row inmate at a higher rate than any other state. This year alone, 10 people have been executed by lethal injection in Texas compared to just three people in the past two decades in Pennsylvania, despite the state having one of the largest death row populations. More victims: Before he was sentenced on Tuesday, Hicks (right, in 2008) allegedly admitted to murdering five other women in Texas. Pennsylvania victim Deanna Null (left) who was 36 at the time of her death in 2008 . It's still unclear how these new admissions will impact Hicks' death sentence in Pennsylvania, or which state would handle the execution if Hicks is convicted of capital crimes in Texas. MailOnline's calls to Mancuso were not immediately returned Wednesday morning. Hicks himself showed relatively little emotion as he received the life-ending news on Tuesday, but reporters in court said his eyes filled with tears. His sisters attended the hearing and started sobbing when they heard the decision. Hicks' sister and mother defended him in court on Monday, pleading the jury to use mercy in deciding the sentence. However, the 12-person jury, which included eight females and four males, eventually decided on the death sentence after determining that Hicks tortured Null before she died. In Pennsylvania, all capital crimes must include proof of an aggravated circumstance, such as torture. In the middle of their deliberations, a jury member was sent back into court to get the legal definition of torture from the judge. The decision did not appear to be an easy one for the jury, as two members were seen wiping away tears as the sentence was read. Hicks' family weren't the only ones to defend his character in court on Monday either, a former cell mate and prison guard testified that he should be spared the death penalty. Jerel Johnson shared a cell with Hicks when he was on trial for murder charge he has since been acquitted of. Thought he was in a 'very dark place' at the time, Hicks helped him get through it. A former prison guard who now volunteers to teach bible study classes as a Jehovah's Witness says several inmates in his group look to Hicks for wisdom. However, those views were countered by a former fiancée who said Hicks became a different person when he started abusing drugs and that he once threatened to kill her. Hicks' case is far from over since all death penalties are automatically reviewed by the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, which can cancel a death sentence. Hicks will formally be sentenced on January 6.","Charles Ray Hicks, 40, was sentenced to death on Tuesday for the January 2008 murder of 36-year-old Deanna Null .

"Teacher Stuart Kerner, who is accused of having sex with a pupil at Bexleyheath Academy . A religious studies teacher had sex ‘all over’ school with a teenage pupil during an 18-month affair, a court heard yesterday. Vice principal Stuart Kerner, 44, ‘gave in to temptation’ and had sex with the girl in a series of empty rooms – including a storage area. Jurors heard how he took the 16-year-old’s virginity in one room as she skipped a lesson – and later tried to amend the school register to make it look like she had been in class. The court heard how he had sex with the ‘besotted’ pupil in the same week his wife miscarried with their second child. The teacher, who is said to have started the affair when she was 15, also took the girl home, where they watched Bargain Hunt on TV between sex sessions, it is alleged. Inner London Crown Court heard yesterday how she was a ‘thoroughly willing participant’ in the affair after becoming infatuated with the teacher at Bexleyheath Academy in south east London. Prosecutor Warwick Tatford said the girl ‘actively sought’ the relationship but accused Kerner – who taught RE, politics and ethics – of a ‘gross breach of trust’. ‘He took advantage of a vulnerable girl who was besotted with him,’ he added. ‘(It was) a teacher giving in to temptation.’ The court was told how the girl was ‘anxious to lose her virginity’ and had sex with Kerner for the first time in February 2012 on a blanket he had brought with him. Giving evidence, she said: ‘My first lesson was IT. In the lesson I had a note. It said, “Go to reception immediately”. My name was on it, it was in his handwriting. I didn’t go to reception – I went to his office. He said go to this room during the fourth lesson.’ She said they then had sex after Kerner moved a table in front of the door and put the blanket over a yoga mat. The schoolgirl later feared she had fallen pregnant, it was claimed. Although she was marked absent from class, her attendance was allegedly later changed on an electronic register by someone using Kerner’s username and password on a computer. Mr Tatford said: ‘He’s changed (her) from being absent to being there. But she wasn’t there, she was having sex with the defendant.’ The girl yesterday told jurors how she had an all-day sex session at the teacher’s home while his wife was at work. She told police she was picked up from a leisure centre in October 2012 before being driven to his home in Aylesford, Kent. Kerner had allegedly hidden condoms in bedside tables and he made her Marmite on toast while they watched Bargain Hunt on television during breaks from sex. She said: ‘It was probably the best day I can remember, just being with him.’ After sex in the guest room, the pair would also roam around the house, where the teacher had a large photo of his eight-year-old son hanging on the wall, she said. On another occasion, when the girl was 15, jurors heard she performed a sex act on him during a week when she was doing work experience at a police child abuse unit – which he described as ‘a bit ironic’. The girl, now 19, told the court how she had kept a coded diary and marked each page with different ‘smiley faces’ to record their encounters. She said Kerner also bought her a keyring with the handcuffs, a ruler and a mask from erotic novel 50 Shades of Grey. ‘He said he thought it was an appropriate gift for me,’ she added. ‘He also bought me chocolates.’ The girl told police Kerner had described their relationship as ‘written in the stars’ and likened their affair to the well-known case of a teacher who ran away to France with a pupil. The pair are allegedly to have had sex inside classrooms at Bexleyheath Academy, pictured . The court heard how they had sex for the final time in a store room in the school’s PE block. The affair was discovered when the girl’s mother looked at her phone and found ‘sexual material’ unrelated to the case, jurors heard. She challenged her daughter who revealed the relationship with her teacher, it was said. Kerner, described as a highly regarded teacher with 20 years’ experience, told police the girl was ‘a pathological liar and a fantasist’. He denies eight child sex offences. The trial continues.

"The librarian who was targeted by one of his disgruntled debate team members is now being hailed as a hero after purposefully running out of the school in an effort to draw out the gunman and keep him away from other students. Tracy Murphy worked as the librarian at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colorado but it was his role as the adult adviser for the speech and debate team that led to him being the target of gunman Karl Pierson's rage. Mr Murphy allegedly demoted Pierson or kicked him off the team earlier this week. Pierson's friend and fellow debate team member has said that he was upset about being demoted and his anger resulted in an even more serious suspension from the team. Proud coach: Tracy Murphy was the school librarian but doubled as the adviser for the speech and debate team (seen huddled around him after a recent win) ‘Karl half-jokingly threatened to kill . Mr Murphy, and Mr Murphy got him suspended for saying that,’ Pierson’s . friend and teammate Joe Redmond told The New York Daily News. ‘Karl . wanted to go to the Air Force Academy and they don’t look positively on . suspensions so (Karl) felt like Mr Murphy had ruined his life.’ Sheriff Grayson Robinson clarified earlier reports and confirmed on Friday evening that Pierson had not been suspended from the school and he even attended classes this morning before bringing his shotgun with him while looking for Mr Murphy shortly after 12.30pm. A recent alum said that he was in the hallway visiting friends when he saw a person 'wearing a mask and a black hoodie reloading a shotgun' before the shooter saw them and took aim. They ducked and found cover in a nearby classroom where they used the safeguards in place- a magnetic locking strip that closed the classroom from the inside- to protect themselves. Pierson reportedly asked passersby for Mr Murphy's location with his shotgun in plain view, and the Sheriff said he 'made no attempts to hide' as he headed towards the library. Once in the library, Pierson reportedly shouted 'Mr Murphy! Mr Murphy!' but never found his target. The shooter: Karl Pierson, a senior at Arapahoe High School, has been named as the shooter who killed himself and injured one other student who remains in the hospital after suffering a significant gun shot wound . Fellow student Frank Warnoff said that he saw Mr Murphy running out of the school just moments after he had heard that Pierson was armed and searching for him. Frank . said that Mr Murphy was ‘incredibly shocked’ and said: ‘I docked . (Pierson) from the speech and debate team and that just shocked him.’ At work: Mr Murphy, seen here in his office, was the target of the shooting and Pierson headed straight for the library looking for him . The decision to flee the scene rather than trying to confront the shooter was a notion preached in one of the many preparedness drills done at the school in case of such an emergency. 'In my opinion, this was the most important tactical decision that was made,' Sheriff Robinson said at an afternoon press conference. 'He took himself away from the school in an effort to get the shooter to go with him.' Mr Murphy was unharmed in the incident and is currently in police custody. Pierson ended up taking his own life on . Friday and emergency responders found Pierson’s body inside the school, . dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Classmates have revealed that Pierson was politically active and spoke about gun laws during class. ‘He had very strong beliefs about gun laws and stuff,’ fellow student Abbey Skoda told The Denver Post hours after the Friday shooting. The . two groups that Pierson belonged to on Facebook suggests that he . enjoyed political discourse, as one is for the members of the Speech and . Debate club and the other is called Smart Sundays, where participants . pose questions for spontaneous virtual conversation. Pierson’s . question to the group was directed towards neoclassicals and . neoliberals, asking why the market hadn’t corrected itself in the wake . of the recession. He later identified himself as a supporter of . Keynesian economic theory. Taking it all away: Friends said that Mr Murphy had recently suspended Pierson from the debate team and he was upset because he thought that would stop him from getting into the Air Force Academy . In other posts, he touted his support for gay rights and made fun of Republicans but then also wrote on Facebook that he did not believe that President Obama did not deserve a second term in office. His friends and fellow seniors Carl . Schmidt and Brendon Mendelson told The Post that his political views . were ‘outside the mainstream’. Pierson . was proud of his participation in the school debate team, even if he . didn’t do as well as he had hoped since he posted in June that he was . eliminated from the national debate championships after only two days of . competition. When word . spread of the shooter’s identity, students seemed surprised that . Pierson, who they knew as a happy 18-year-old was the one toting the . shotgun. Single file: The school was evacuated and students were patted down individually before being taken to a staging area where they were interviewed and then reunited with their frightened parents . Horrible: A mother comforts her daughter after the shooting, which came the day before the one-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting . Emergency response: State and local police were joined by SWAT teams on the scene . ‘I could see a bit nerdy and geeky but in a sort of charming way,’ Frank Warnoff said to local station KDVR. ‘I could see that he was bullied but he was always very humble and down to earth, always in a good mood and energetic. I just never saw him as this kind of person.’ Others seemed aware of the bullying that Pierson may have gone through but did not feel that it was significant enough to serve as an explanation for the shooting. ‘He was exuberant I guess. A lot of people picked on him, but it didn't seem to bother him,’ classmate Thomas Conrad said of Pierson, who he also classified as a socialist.","Tracy Murphy was the Arapahoe High School librarian and also worked as the adviser for the Speech and Debate Team .

"Child beggars as young as four earn up to £100,000 each for gypsy gangs, a shocking investigation has revealed. The children work in teams on London's streets, wheedling money out of tourists in snow and rain. Some of the children make £500 a day - and hand it all over to their Romany 'minders', the BBC's Panorama programme found. Please miss: 'Alice' begs while supervised by her minder in Edgware Road, London . Good earner: A Romany minder takes money from a young girl on her 'team' in front of Regent's Park mosque in London. The children all dressed in modest clothes and wore headscarves, despite not being Muslim . Reporter John Sweeney called it 'a 21st-century version of Oliver Twist' - the Charles Dickens novel in which the villain Fagin forces a group of young children to extract cash from rich Londoners for him. The documentary, screened on BBC1 on Wednesday, followed the children - all of them gypsies from Romania - over the course of a year. A girl of about four, who the programme-makers called 'Alice', used a phone box as a toilet and scavenged for food at McDonald's as she begged on the streets. They found the child 'experienced in begging', as she tried to coax and wheedle money from them while dressed in a white headscarf. The children all dressed in modest clothes and wore headscarves, despite not being Muslim - targeting mosques and areas popular with rich tourists from the Gulf States. The BBC filmed a group of young Roma women controlling several children outside Regent's Park mosque, including a four-year-old boy. They followed the group to a house in Ilford, Essex, where a BMW X5 four-wheel drive car sat on the drive. Practised in persuasion: 'Alice' persuades a passer-by to hand over a £5 note . Lost childhood: The youngster then follows a tourist down the street with her hand outstretched . The programme found that police generally just take the beggars' details and let them go. They fear the people on the streets are being exploited by other members of their community. Last year, detectives launched Operation Golf in an effort to crack down on those running the scam. Many of the criminals were traced back to Romania, where they own numerous luxury properties and cars. Bernie Gravett, the former Metropolitan Police Supt who led the operation, said: 'This is modern-day slavery. How does a four-year-old child consent to be exploited? 'They won't know that it's criminal to beg on the streets of the UK. They are kids.' The joint British-Romanian police operation arrested 26 alleged child traffickers from Tandarei in the south of Romania. The accused were imprisoned for months but denied any wrongdoing and have since been released. The case continues as two judges in Romania have sent the case back to the prosecution and in the meantime, the accused cannot leave the country. Exploited: Reporter John Sweeney goes to Romania to confront a gypsy woman, Denisa Mazarache, who makes her four-year-old daughter beg for her on the streets of London . Deceitful: A Romanian woman begs from a Muslim woman in London, using a toddler to tug on the heartstrings . Mr Sweeney followed 'Alice' and her minder - her mother, Denisa Mazarache - to Fetesti in southern Romania. She admitted to having begged in London, but said she had been desperate and had stopped a year ago. However, the BBC said they had filmed her begging in London just two months earlier. Police have disrupted the gangs in Britain by targeting them for benefit fraud. Nine people, eight of them Romanian Gypsies, went to prison earlier this year for a total of 10 years for claiming £800,000 worth of benefits. A nine-bedroomed house in Tandarei, Romania - typical of the extravagant properties found in the area where many of those found to be exploiting youngster come from . Romanians are not ordinarily entitled to UK state benefits, but police told Panorama that gangs produced forged documents. Chief Inspector Colin Carswell, who was also part of Operation Golf, said one gang put the earning potential of a single child in London at close to £100,000 a year - from begging, stealing and being used for benefit fraud. Mr Sweeney met one of the men arrested during Operation Golf in Tandarei, a town dotted with luxury villas. The man blamed Britain for the tricksters' actions. 'The blame is with the British state, which gives them a lot of money,' he said. 'They have lots of children, seven, eight or ten children, and if they have many children they build a villa.' 'Some collect £10,000, £12,000, £13,000 a month - they have three or four or five sets of benefits.'","BBC investigators filmed tiny Romanian girl scavenging for food in the street .

"The under-fire editor of Newsnight acknowledged his 'boring snoring' Twitter blunder last night by having #fail written next to his name on the show's closing credits. Ian Katz was forced to issue a series of humbling public apologies after he slurred Labour's senior frontbencher Rachel Reeves to 26,000 followers after an interview on Monday night. At the end of the first Newsnight since the error, Mr Katz, who is only in his second week in the job, decided to run #fail next to his Twitter handle @iankatz1000. The hashtag is often used online to describe a mistake of epic proportions. Says it all: After a tough day and a series of apologies, Newsnight editor Ian Katz admitted his 'boring snoring' Twitter blunder was an epic #fail . Row: Newsnight editor Ian Katz is under pressure to issue a public apology after branding Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves 'boring snoring' on Twitter . Poor show: Ian Katz thought he was sending a private direct message on Twitter but it went to his followers and came to the attention of Ms Reeves . Apology: The editor, who came from the Guardian after the Savile scandal rocked the show, was forced to apologise for another blunder linked to Newsnight . Yesterday furious Labour party officials vowed to boycott the programme in . protest warned the Opposition's 'confidence in the impartiality and . fairness' in the BBC had been undermined. The former Guardian deputy editor had . thought that his post was a private message but ended up tweeting it to . his more than 26,000 followers. Apology: Mr Katz has now written to Labour to say sorry for the 'personal offence' caused but he maintained that Newsnight is impartial . The message, which was subsequently deleted, appears to have been meant in reply to a comment about the programme. Mr Katz tweeted: 'Tnks ... except for . boring snoring rachel reeves ... playout was fun tho, wasn't it? telly . MUCH netter (sic) than snooooozepapers innit.' The post prompted an apparently sarcastic reply from shadow treasury chief secretary Ms Reeves, who simply said 'thanks...'. As shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Miss Reeves is effectively deputy to shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher wrote on Twitter: 'Good luck in future to @BBCNewsnight in trying to persuade Labour people to go on their frankly rather boring programme at 11 at night ... 'And whilst I'm at it ... I'm not sure a guy who worked for the Guardian (yawn) & now Newsnight (snooze) can lecture people about being boring.' Former cabinet minister John Denham added: 'Ian Katz helped me answer whether I wanted to go from Southampton to Glasgow to appear on Newsnight.' Last night Mr Katz quickly apologised for the 'ill-judged' comment, which he said was supposed to have been a direct message to one individual Twitter user. He said: 'Accidentally sent v ill-judged tweet referring to @RachelReevesMP's appearance on NN. 'Thought was DM but in any circs wrong. Have apologised.' Gaffe: Newsnight editor Ian Katz has said sorry online but Miss Reeves is said to be upset after the 'boring' jibe . As the storm over his tweet intensified this morning, at lunchtime he wrote to Labour's top spin doctor Bob Roberts and apologised again, this time 'unreservedly'. 'As you know it was intended as a private message but as you rightly say that is no excuse,' he said. 'I don't accept your implication that my tweet reflects in any way on the impartiality or fairness of Newsnight, except to the extent it reflects a determination make Newsnight as interesting as I can'. He went on: 'I particularly regret any personal offence I have caused to Rachel and hope she will come on again soon'. Top team: As shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Miss Reeves is effectively deputy to shadow chancellor Ed Balls . However, the Labour party made clear it was not going to let the matter rest. The party today sent an email to Mr Katz demanding a full public apology for the 'completely unacceptable' comment. The message said: 'We would like to express our anger and disappointment at your tweet following Newsnight's interview with Rachel Reeves. 'It is completely unacceptable for a senior BBC editor to have expressed this view, whether or not you intended for it to be made public. 'It is vitally important that the Labour Party, our shadow cabinet and Newsnight viewers have confidence in the impartiality and fairness of your programme, and the criteria on which guests and interviews are judged. 'This incident undermines that confidence and it is important that this is redressed. Although a tweet of apology has been made, a full written public apology should be made by the end of the day.' Argument: Ms Reeves was grilled by Jeremy Paxman on Labour's links to the unions and zero hours contracts . Row: Labour's vice-chairman Michael Dugher condemned the gaffe and ridiculed Newsnight as 'boring' Mr Katz replaced Peter Rippon who left the programme in the wake of the Jimmy Savile crisis. He . joined the Guardian in 1990 and has worked as a reporter, foreign . correspondent, features editor and editor of the Saturday Guardian. His appointment at the BBC reportedly raised eyebrows within the industry due to his lack of television experience. Ms Reeves was appearing on the show to explain Labour's 'zero hours' policy.","Ian Katz ran the acknowledgement on first Newsnight since slur .

"Wayne Rooney scored on his return to the Manchester United attack as Louis van Gaal’s side survived an FA Cup upset at Preston Monday night to set up a quarter-final clash at home to Arsenal. The England captain, who has been forced to play in midfield recently by Van Gaal, completed United’s 3-1 comeback victory by winning and converting a late penalty to end a scoring drought that had lasted 952 minutes. It sparked a debate over whether Rooney had dived, with Preston boss Simon Grayson insisting there had been no contact between the United star and his goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann, and also claiming that Rooney was offside when Ander Herrera scored the equaliser. Paul Gallagher of Preston remonstrates with Wayne Rooney after he earns Manchester United a penalty . The striker touched the ball past North End goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckman during the FA Cup clash . Rooney went down moments after and several of the Preston players were unhappy with his actions . Rooney lies down on the ground before the penalty is given by the referee late on at Deepdale . Grayson said: ‘Wayne Rooney has not been touched by the goalkeeper. Yes he has had to jump out of the way but he has not been touched. I’m not saying it wasn’t a penalty, I’m saying there was no contact. You can interpret that how you want. ‘It wasn’t a dive. He has gone to get out of the way and take evasive action. I’ m not complaining. ‘The first one, he is close to interfering with our goalkeeper. It’s a grey area. He wasn’t directly in his line, he was just to the side. ‘The second goal, Tom Clarke was pushed by Fellaini. It is a slight push but sometimes they go for you, sometimes they don’t. ‘But the players can wake up in the norming and be very proud of what they have done. I certainly am. Full credit to the players, they have come up against one of the top teams in the world and United know they were in a game.’ Simon Grayson admits that Rooney was taking evasive action to get out of the way of the goalkeeper .

"A Baltimore man convicted of dousing his unsuspecting roommate with boiling water after accusing him of eating all of his breakfast sausages has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors say 39-year-old Donte Frye was found guilty of assault for luring his roommate to the top of the basement stairs and throwing a pot of boiling salt water on his face in April 2013. The victim tumbled down the stairs and hit his head on the door. The attack left the man with second-degree burns and severe scarring, which required months of treatment. Bad roommate: Donte Frye, 39, has been convicted of assault for luring roommate to the top of basement stairs and throwing a pot of boiling salt water on him in April 2013 . Prosecutors say Frye was mad because he mistakenly thought his roommate had eaten his breakfast treats. Describing Frye as a 'violent repeat offender,' the State's Attorney's Office said jail records indicate that he felt no remorse for the attack and even bragged about stabbing another roommate. According to officials, the 39-year-old poked fun at the man disfigured by burns saying that the boiling water 'ain't an actual weapon' and that 'the dude wasn't even bleeding,' reported WBAL-TV. According to the Baltimore Sun, Frye's attorney, Stephen Beatty, has attempted to play down the April 11, 2013, incident saying that his client and the victim were both to blame for the scuffle, and that the prosecution had exaggerated the extent of the man's injuries. Frye was mad because he mistakenly thought his roommate had eaten his breakfast sausages . Donte Frye was sentenced Monday to 25 years without the possibility of parole. The hefty prison term follows two prior convictions for attempted murder. Prosecutors say Frye stabbed two roommates in separate incidents in 1993 and 2004. Frye's criminal record also includes multiple drug and firearm charges.","Donte Frye has been convicted of assault for luring roommate to the top of basement stairs and throwing a pot of boiling salt water on him in April 2013 .

"Lord Sugar has been investigated by police after being accused of posting a racist Twitter message, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The outspoken entrepreneur and Apprentice star posted a photograph of a crying Chinese child to 3.2 million Twitter followers, joking that the youngster was upset after being told off for leaving Apple’s iPhone production  line – a reference to the Asian factories where the phones are made. The tweet prompted a single complaint to the Metropolitan Police from a Twitter user, who referred to the Labour peer as a ‘vile racist’. Row: Lord Sugar, left, offended Nichola Szeto, right, with a tweet . Police contacted the complainant twice, urging her to make a statement at a police station, which she eventually did, and yesterday police confirmed that officers from Merseyside’s Hate Crime Investigation Unit took several days to decide whether a crime had been committed by the Labour peer’s tweet. However, the remark was in the end classed as a ‘hate incident’ – which means no further action will be taken, although details will be kept on file. Last night, the TaxPayers’ Alliance condemned the police investigation, insisting officers should not waste time chasing ‘ill-thought-out tweets’. Circulating the light-hearted pictures of a child dressed in a water melon costume on Monday, Lord Sugar wrote: ‘The kid in the middle is upset because he was told off  for leaving the production line of the iPhone 5.’ 'Production line': Nichola Szeto took offence at Lord Sugar posting the tweet below . Liverpool shop owner Nichola Szeto, whose husband and family are Chinese, complained to the Metropolitan Police Twitter account, saying: ‘I thought racism was illegal.’ She was contacted by police on Wednesday but declined to give a statement. At 8am the next day, she was again contacted by officers who said they wanted to visit her home. Instead, she agreed to attend a police station  in Central Liverpool later that day, where she spent an hour giving a statement to two officers. Reaction: Ms Szeto complained that Lord Sugar's tweet was racist . Ms Szeto, who runs a health supplements business with her husband, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I told the police I just wanted to let him know it was wrong. 'They said they take this very seriously, but I said, “Just leave it, I’ve complained now.” But they phoned back so I went to see them.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive  of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Individuals must be held to account for their actions, even on social  media, but officers should not waste their time chasing every ill-thought-out tweet.' Last night a spokesman for Lord Sugar declined to comment.","Apprentice star's tweet offended Nichola Szeto, who spoke to police .

"Rudy Gestede underlined his value to Blackburn Rovers – and Crystal Palace – as he helped the Championship side into the fifth round at the expense of nine-man Swansea. Gestede is the subject of a £3.5million bid from Palace but Blackburn are refusing to sell their leading scorer for less than £5m. They left the Benin international on the bench and he came on to score the decisive second goal in the 78th minute in front of just 5,928 supporters at Ewood Park. Blackburn Rovers came from behind to beat nine-man Swansea City 3-1 in their FA Cup fourth round clash at Ewood Park . Gylfi Sigurdsson fired Swansea City into the lead with a brilliant long-range effort that flew into the top corner of the net . Sigurdsson watches on as his shot from distance finds the back of the net during the first half of the FA Cup clash . But the hosts were behind for less than two minutes, Chris Taylor scored the equaliser after a good cross from Marcus Olsson . Rovers midfielder Taylor celebrates after scoring the goal that brought the hosts back onto level terms at Ewood Park . Crystal Palace target Rudy Gestede scores the winning goal for Blackburn Rovers with 12 minutes left to play . BLACKBURN ROVERS (4-4-1-1): Eastwood 6; Henley 6, Duffy 7, Kilgallon 6.5, Olsson 7; Cairney 6.5, Lowe 6, Williamson 5 (Dunn 41, 6, Rhodes 77, 6), Conway 8; Taylor 7; King 7 (Gestede 60, 7). Subs not used: Steele, Hanley, Brown, Rhodes, Marshall. Scorers: Taylor 23, Gestede 78, Conway 89. Booked: Williamson. SWANSEA CITY (4-2-3-1): Fabianski 5; Rangel 5.5, Bartley 4.5, Amat 5, Tiendalli 6; Carroll 6 (Fernandez 9, 5.5), Shelvey 5; Sigurdsson 6.5; Dyer 6, Gomis 4.5 (Oliviera 77, 6), Barrow 5 (Montero 62, 6). Subs not used: Tremmel, Emnes, Naughton, Fulton. Scorer: Sigurdsson 21. Sent off: Bartley, Sigurdsson. Booked: Dyer. Referee: Craig Pawson 5. Star man: Craig Conway. Att: 5928 . It not only showed that Gestede is unlikely to have any trouble scoring against top-flight opposition, but also why Blackburn’s Indian owners Venky’s are holding out for an extra £1.5m. Manager Gary Bowyer said: ‘If you look at the last striker that moved into the Premier League and for how much, you’re not talking peanuts these days. ‘Our owners have rightly put a value on him. If that value is match then there’s a decision to be made, but at the moment the figures are nowhere near what they are looking for. If Rudy goes, he will be a big miss. ‘We had no trouble putting back in the squad and putting him on. People involved in the game might try and turn players’ heads but he’s conducted himself magnificently well.’ Bowyer acknowledged that the sending-off of Swansea centre-back Kyle Bartley in the sixth-minute ‘levelled the game’. Bartley was caught out by the sheer pace of Josh King as the striker chased Matt Kilgallon’s long ball and appeared to lean into his opponent on the edge of the penalty box. Both players went to ground and it seemed a harsh decision by referee Craig Pawson to produce a straight red card. Swansea were then reduced to nine men two minutes into added time at the end of the game when Gylfi Sigurdsson allowed frustration to get the better of him and ploughed into the back of Chris Taylor. The Icelander will now miss the next three Premier League fixtures against Southampton, Sunderland and West Brom, completing a miserable couple of weeks for the South Wales club in which leading scorer Wilfried Bony was sold to Manchester City and they lost 5-0 at home to Chelsea. ‘The season won’t fizzle out, I will make sure of that,’ said manager Garry Monk, who dismissed speculation linking his club with a bid for Gestede’s strike partner Jordan Rhodes. ‘It’s my job and I won’t accept that. We are in a difficult moment but it’s important we come through that together.

"An outrageous stunt considered a bit of a joke has landed a man, who taxied his light plane down a main street  and parked it outside a pub, a hefty $5000 fine. Anthony Whiteway, 37, infuriated police from the small town of Newman, in Western Australia's Pilbara region when they were called to the Newman hotel Purple Pub earlier this month to where the small yellow plane had been parked outside. He was charged with committing an act likely to endanger the life, health or safety of a person, at Newman Magistrates Court on Tuesday. A small two-seater plane, with no wings, was found parked outside a local pub in West Australia's Newman by police officers on Friday . Anthony Whiteaway was charged $5,000 . The plane which had its propeller running, had its wings removed and was being steered by foot pedals. 'It was a pretty stupid thing to do,' Newman Police sergeant Mark McKenzie told AAP after the incident earlier this month. 'Kids were coming home from school. It could have been very ugly.' 'All he needed was one gust of wind ... because without the wings, it's not stable.' 'People think it was a bit of a laugh but it was very dangerous and we're not very happy with it.' Mr Whiteway, who does not hold a pilot's licence, told the ABC he wouldn't take the plane to the pub again. A bar tender at the Newman Hotel (pictured) said  customers cheered the man on through his interview with police and had dubbed him a 'legend' The man who refers to himself as 'Automan' told West Australian newspaper that he 'taxied it perfectly' 'I knew what I was doing,' he told West Australian newspaper. 'I taxied it perfectly. Look how well I parked it.' At the time of the incident, a bar tender at the Newman Hotel told Daily Mail Australia that the 37-year-old driver of the plane entertained pub patrons by 'playing dumb' when being questioned by police. She said the customers were cheering the man on through his interview with police and had dubbed him a 'legend'. And despite labelling it very dangerous, local officers did not entirely fail to see the humours side of the stunt. Not all of the local officers have failed to see the humours side of the incident, with Esperance police launching a  Twitter competition . Following the incident, Esperance police launched a competition over Twitter asking social media users to come up with the best caption for a photograph of the plane parked outside the Newman Hotel. It wrote, 'Best caption wins a Mars Bar and tour of Esperance police station. Thanks #Newman police for the chuckles.' And Facebook users certainly delivered with an array of hilarious and pun filled captions including 'when all else fails you have to wing it', 'Parking, Northern Territory style', and 'a man and a plane go into a bar'.","A Western Australian man who taxied a small plane to his local pub in Newman has been fined $5000 .

"Eliaquim Mangala claims that Diego Costa does try to provoke his opponents – but insists it's irrelevant if Chelsea’s combative striker is allowed to play in Saturday’s title clash with Manchester City at Stamford Bridge. Costa will face a FA disciplinary hearing on Friday to contest a charge of violent conduct after it was alleged that he deliberately stamped on Emre Can in Chelsea’s Capital One Cup semi-final win over Liverpool in midweek. The Spain striker, who also clashed with Martin Skrtel and Steven Gerrard in a bad-tempered encounter, faces a three-game ban if found guilty – starting with the game against champions City. Liverpool midfielder Emre Can (right) is separated from Chelsea striker Diego Costa . Chelsea's Costa (right) almost comes to blows with Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard . Mangala admitted that Costa tries ‘to provoke a reaction’ from his markers to distract them, and believes the best way of combating it is to simply ignore him. ‘For me it doesn’t matter if Costa is playing or not,’ said the big City defender. ‘The most important thing is to care about what we have to do. Whether it’s Costa who plays, (Didier) Drogba or Loïc Rémy it’s the same thing for me. We need to beat them. No matter who is playing on the day, our target is to win that game. ‘Costa is a player that always tries to win a mental duel against his opponent. He always tries to unsettle his marker or other players and distract them from playing their normal game. An agitated Costa yet again confronts a Liverpool player, this time it's defender Martin Skrtel . Costa (top) appears to stamp on Liverpool's Skrtel during their English League Cup semi-final match . ‘He likes to provoke a reaction but, personally, I don’t respond to that. When you know that it’s what he is looking for, it’s better to ignore him because he will then realise that what he is doing is pointless. If you react he wins.’ Mangala admitted that City need to win to have a chance of closing the five-point gap at the top of the table. ‘We go there to get a result,’ he added. ‘It’s an important game against an important rival for the title. We need to close the gap with Chelsea and the best way to do that is to get a win in Stamford Bridge. ‘I think Chelsea will play on the counter-attack. We are an attack-minded team and we will not change our style of play. We need to play our normal game.

"Almost a quarter of boys in state schools are classed as having special educational needs, official figures reveal. Nearly a fifth of all pupils are considered to have problems including learning difficulties, speech and language needs or a form of autism, the data shows, with twice as many boys as girls affected. However, the results were met with incredulity by some education experts yesterday. Two years ago a damning Ofsted report said 450,000 children had been labelled SEN to cover up poor teaching. Tuition: Nearly a fifth of all pupils are considered to have problems including learning difficulties, speech and language needs or a form of autism, the data shows, with twice as many boys as girls affected (file picture) Schools can also claim extra funds if pupils are classed as having certain types of educational needs. And it is taken into account when assessing exam results – thus boosting a school’s standing in league tables. Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, who has been a headteacher in the state and private sectors, said: ‘It’s become an industry that has grown over the past 20 years at a rate that is impossible to believe. In my view, a lot of it is to do with children not getting good teaching. ‘One of the criteria for classifying children as SEN is they can’t read when they get to seven or eight. That is often because of the way they have been taught. ‘It also attracts extra funding, so it is a way of boosting a school’s budget.’ A local authority makes a statement of special educational needs if it decides that the child’s needs cannot be provided from within the school’s resources. These resources can include money, staff time and special equipment. The Department for Education figures found 1.5million children at all schools were classed as SEN in January. This is actually down slightly on last year, when the figure was 1.6 million. Separate Government data published last . week found pupils with a statement of special educational needs are . about eight times more likely to be expelled and six times more likely . to be suspended at least once. Special needs: Some parents were found to be lobbying for positive diagnoses so that their children would receive extra support, such as tuition and extra time in exams (file picture) Pupils with SEN, but no statement, are 11 times more likely to be permanently excluded and five times more likely to get one or more suspensions. The Ofsted report unearthed a ‘culture of excuses’ in some schools which meant pupils making slow progress were classed as SEN. 'It’s become an industry that has grown over the past 20 years at a rate that is impossible to believe. In my view, a lot of it is to do with children not getting good teaching' Chris McGovern, Campaign for Real Education . Some parents were also found to be lobbying for positive diagnoses so that their children would receive extra support, such as tuition and extra time in exams. The report said the term special educational needs ‘is used too widely’ with many schools using low attainment and relatively slow progress as their principal indicators. ‘Inspectors saw schools that identified pupils as having special needs when, in fact, their needs were no different from most other pupils,’ it said. All schools’ funding includes an element to support children with SEN. But if the SEN costs per pupil are more than £6,000, the local authority helps with the additional costs. A DfE spokesman said: ‘We are reforming the special educational needs system so that children and their parents have more say and greater control over the support they receive. ‘Our reforms will improve outcomes for pupils with SEN by providing better information for families, greater integration of vital services and one system for children and young people with SEN from birth to 25.’","Nearly a fifth of pupils considered to have difficulties such as autism .

"Angry shoppers have demanded people boycott a fashion brand, claiming its logo bears a striking resemblance to the Nazi eagle insignia which became the national symbol of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. A-list celebrities including singers Rhianna and Jessie J and model Cara Delevingne, have been spotted wearing the UK-based Boy London brand in the past. The brand's logo depicts a spread-winged eagle perched on a podium on top of the letter 'O' in the world 'Boy', which is written underneath. Outraged customers have called for the company to take action after drawing comparisons with the infamous Nazi Parteiadler symbol. The fashion brand Boy London is coming under increased pressure to redesign its logo after angry shoppers drew comparisons between it and a symbol used by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party . The Parteiadler emblem was made Germany's national symbol under Hitler's Nazi Party in 1935 . The image was used as the emblem for Hitler's party. The eagle is facing the same way as in the Boy London logo, but carrying a swastika in its claws, instead of the 'O'. Department store, Fenwick, have now withdrawn the brand from its position at the entrance to their store in Brent Cross Shopping Centre in north-west London. A spokeswoman for the store said: 'Our Boy London line is no longer on the shop floor as we investigate the matter directly with the brand.' But unisex T-shirts featuring the eagle emblem were still on sale for £35 at Selfridges in the Bull Ring in Birmingham today. Disgusted shoppers yesterday called for the brand to removed from all shops. One customer, Polish-born Jakub Mozdzanowski, 34, said: 'I saw the logo on a T-shirt a few weeks ago and it wasn’t a good feeling. Then I saw it on someone else a week later and I even went over to speak to them. Dictator Adolf Hitler is seen pictured in front of his Nazi Party's emblem the Parteiadler (left). And (right) the symbol is seen on the label of a 1943 bottle of unopened red Fuhrerwein wine . 'I showed them the Nazi symbol on the internet and they were shocked. 'I don’t get offended easily but it was like a slap in the face. I showed it to my girlfriend and she said she didn’t like looking at it. 'It’s quite embroidered on Polish people’s minds, it gives you the creeps. 'I’m Polish so it’s quite close to home. I’ve heard stories from my grandparents about the war and about when we were invaded. 'The logo should be taken off. I would think if the logo went then the company would go with it. 'It is wrong that people wear it, I would call on people not to wear that logo.' Despite the controversy, Boy London has refused to accept any comparison between its trademark logo and the fascist Third Reich’s Parteiadler symbol. A spokesman said: 'The brand is in no way connected to Nazism or the idea of anyone being discriminated against for their creed, colour or religious beliefs.' A white Boy London t-shirt (pictured) cost £35 from Selfridges in the Bull Ring, Birmingham . He explained that the logo 'was inspired by the eagle of the Roman Empire as a sign of decadence and strength. Its aim is to empower people rather than oppress'. Boy London was founded by Israel-based businessman John Krivine in the 1970s and his original boutique in Chelsea, London, sold outrageous items - including t-shirts with dried animal blood and jewellery made from hypodermic syringes, which were modelled by the original punks. Mr Krivine, who sold the punk-inspired company in 1984, said: 'I don’t know what kind of eagle it was - Roman Legion, American Indian, Continental Congress, Third Reich - it looked cool.' Nazi imagery had been a feature of the late 70s punk’s rebellion and Mr Krivine’s competitor, Jewish punk entrepreneur Malcolm McLaren, sold swastika T-shirts to trade on the symbol’s shock value. In 2007, high-street chain Zara was forced to withdraw stocks of handbags because they were emblazoned with swastikas. Zara said the bag came from an external supplier and the symbol had not been visible when it was selected. The Nazi Party emblem was inspired by an historic symbol used in Germany, the Reichsadler. The Reichsadler was derived from the Roman eagle standard used by the Holy Roman Emperors. At the time the eagle was the insignia of the Imperial power as distinguished from the Imperial states. The eagle began to appear in the 9th Century on the banner of Charlemagne and his successors. Since then the majestic bird has been used to symbolise the Habsburg Monarchy as well as the Austrian Empire. The Nazi Party emblem from The Admiral Graf Spee is raised from the seabed. The logo became the national symbol in Hitler's Germany in 1935 . During the 1848 revolutions in Germany, attempts were made to re-implement the Reichsadler as a symbole of unity. In 1871 a single-headed eagle became the insignia of Otto von Bismarck's Lesser German solution, which sought to unify the northern German states, leaving out Austria. In contrast the Greater German Solution favoured unifying all German-speaking peoples under ones state and was promoted by the Austrian Empire. After the First World War the Weimar Republic under President Friedrich Ebert assumed a plain version of the Reichsadler, which stayed in use until 1935. It was then that Adolf Hitler introduced his own stylised eagle combining the bird with the Nazi swastika to create a new national emblem. Hitler introduced both his own version of the Reichsadler, in which the eagle is looking towards its right shoulder, and another version the Nazi Party's Parteiadler (the Party's eagle), where the eagle looks to its left. At the conclusion of the Second World War and with the defeat of the Nazis, the Federal Republic of Germany re-introduced the eagle used by the Weimar Republic under the direction of President Theodor Heuss in 1950.","Boy London brand has been criticised for its eagle design logo .

"Iraq has urged the United Nations to investigate Islamic State terrorists' bloody trade in human organs after the Iraqi ambassador said doctors are being executed for not harvesting body parts. Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul over the past few weeks. ISIS' horrifying trade in human organs, which was revealed by MailOnline last December, is just the latest way for the terrorist organisation to finance its activities, with other major sources of the group's $2 million-a-day income being the sale of oil, ransom payments, and smuggled antiques. Lucrative: ISIS has set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market . Speaking of ISIS' organ harvesting operations, Mr Alhakim said: 'We have bodies. Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts.' He also said a dozen doctors have been 'executed' in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting. Mr Alhakim briefed the UN Security Council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of 'crimes of genocide' in targeting certain ethnic groups. The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, also told the council that last month alone, 790 people were killed by terrorism and armed conflict in the country. He also noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that IS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that 'it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day'. He used an acronym for the group. Making them rich: Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul (pictured) over the past few weeks . Mr Mladenov said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized over the past year. The Sunni militants currently controls around a third of both Iraq and neighbouring Syria and imposed its strict interpretation of Sharia law in its self-declared caliphate  - subjecting a population of around four million people to a brutal campaign of rape and massacre. 'Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,' Mr Mladenov said, using an alternative acronym for the group known as ISIS in the West and Daesh in Arab nations. The shocking news of ISIS trade in human organs was first revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website in December, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli. He told the site that ISIS commanders hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in Mosul that is already beginning to generate huge profits. Militants: Each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp, indicating the province from which it was sent. They are understood to have been handed to ISIS' network of messengers and fighters . The al-Monitor report also claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market. '[Al-Mosuli] said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors,' the report's author wrote. 'Information then leaked about organ selling.' The report went on: 'Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.' Most of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe, the Assyrian International News Agency reported. While organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS' revenue streams, the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the group's $2million annual income. Security: ISIS' horrifying trade in human organs, which was revealed by MailOnline last December, is just the latest way for the terrorist organisation to finance its activities, with other major sources of the group's $2 million-a-day income being the sale of oil, ransom payments, and smuggled antiques . Intelligence chiefs are investigating claims the Islamic State jihadi who led the executions of 21 Egyptians was an American recruit. The militant, who spoke English with a U.S. accent, appeared in a horrific video on Sunday showing the beheadings of a group of Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. Brandishing a knife, he declares: 'All crusaders... the sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah we will mix it with your blood.' The men are then forced to lie face-down before they are beheaded simultaneously. U.S. officials are understood to be analysing the militant's facial features and speech patterns as has been done in the hunt for the British executioner known as Jihadi John, who has appeared in a number of beheading videos in Syria. Professor Erik Thomas, a linguistics expert at North Carolina State University, believes he 'sounds like an American' with some Arabic influence, based on some of word pronunciations. One tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over $8,000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey. Drug smuggling is another. Al Monitor's report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh, which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (RFDCS) says is generating 'significant revenues.' Its drug business has become so successful in recent months that the RFDCS claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market. Yesterday it was revealed that militants fighting for ISIS in Syria are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy Westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men. Looted from ancient buildings in ISIS strongholds, such as the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, the antiquities are up to 10,000-years-old and can exchange hands for more than $1 million each. The most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy  Europeans - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects, which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring Lebanon and Turkey. The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year. The finer points of ISIS trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the BBC. It revealed that ISIS militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control. If the smugglers decide not to buy the items, they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry, regardless of their historic significance.","Iraqi ambassador says corpses are being found with missing body parts .

"We're used to seeing Burnley in claret and blue, but the visitors wore a silver strip last night that made it look as though they had been wrapped in tin foil. The club’s third kit was first seen at Sunderland late last month and was preferred to their all-black away kit again. At first glance, it looked like Sean Dyche had fielded a team of 11 tin men from the Wizard of Oz, but Burnley's performance soon showed they were not lacking any heart as they gave the home side more than a few scares at Old Trafford. Burnley ditched their black kit in favour of a shiny silver strip at Manchester United as George Boyd reflects on a missed chance for the Clarets at Old Trafford .

Manchester United are unlikely to ever play in the colour again after Sir Alex Ferguson binned it at half-time during a defeat at Southampton in 1996. United's technical area has been vacant for much of the season with Louis van Gaal happy to observe proceedings from the dugout and make notes on his clipboard, unlike his predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson who used it to great effect as a means of berating match officials and scaring the wits out of his players.

Van Gaal’s assistant Ryan Giggs assumed a significantly higher profile last night, however, as he spent large parts of the game stood alongside Dyche on the touchline.

Phil Jones (right) was jeered off by Burnley fans after picking up an injury, with his replacement Chris Smalling scoring just 22 seconds after replacing him to silence the boo boys among the away supporters . The chant was drowned out when Jones’s replacement Chris Smalling scored with his first touch from a corner having been on the pitch for just 22 seconds, and he went on to head United in front again at the end of the first half. Sean Dyche included three former United players in his team – David Jones, Michael Keane and Tom Heaton – but a serious knee injury suffered by Dean Marney last weekend meant that the Burnley boss was unable to name the same starting line-up for the 11th league game in a row. Michael Keane (left) was one of three former Manchester United players that started for Burnley as he attempts to close down James WIlson . Daley Blind was the second United player to be substituted before half-time after suffering a cut over his left eye in a collision with team-mate Jonny Evans.

Blind walks off after picking up an injury as United were forced to make two first half changes . Talk of Manchester United turning into a long-ball team had dominated the build-up to this game thanks to some mischievous comments from Sam Allardyce and the reaction of Louis van Gaal who turned up at his pre-match press conference armed with statistical evidence to the contrary. Marouane Fellaini was not called upon at Old Trafford following his central showing at West Ham on Sunday . The target man at the centre of it all, 6ft 4in Marouane Fellaini, doesn’t seem to mind either way. ‘I’m a midfielder and I like to play a bit more defensive, but it’s up to the manager,’ said Fellani. ‘Wherever he tells me to play, that’s where I play.

It’s another opponent with another playing style, and if you lose the game you are out. ‘For me it’s not a change or an exception because we prepare our matches the same way as Premier League matches or friendly games.

That’s why you have to prepare yourself very well. It is not so easy to beat Cambridge United. QPR in the last match is also how Cambridge play. ‘The FA Cup is different more in the atmosphere I think. Here it is very important for the fans and people and players, that’s the difference.

"A Twitter troll who posted abusive messages about the fatal stabbing of teacher Ann Maguire has been jailed for eight weeks. Robert Riley, 42, of Port Talbot, South Wales, told his followers he would have killed 'all the b****** teachers' at Corpus Christ School, Leeds, where the 61-year-old was fatally stabbed on April 28. Jobless Riley, a former heroin addict, sent the shocking tweets two days after the teacher's death, showing 'complete disregard' for the tragedy, his sentencing hearing was told. Scroll down for video . Handcuffed: Robert Riley, 42, is taken away to the cells after being jailed for eight weeks for sending sickening messages about the death of school teacher Ann Maguire . Riley, who uses the Twitter handle @johnriley001, told followers he would have killed 'all of the b*****d teachers' at the Corpus Christi School, Leeds, where Mrs Maguire taught . The former heroin addict tried to shield himself from cameras as he was led away to the cells after the hearing . Swansea Magistrates' Court heard Riley even seemed to revel in his new-found notoriety. After sending the tweets, Riley, who uses the Twitter handle @johnriley001, told followers he had 'the biggest gob this side of the River Severn'. He also posted a series of racist tweets . claiming Nazi death camp Auschwitz was a 'health spa' and suggesting . Muslim babies should be drowned, the court was told. But at the hearing earlier today, Riley begged for leniency. He had previously pleaded guilty to one charge of sending a grossly offensive message via a public communications network. But chairwoman of the bench Georgina Scannell made no secret of her disgust, telling the defendant she had no choice but to send him straight to jail. Mrs Maguire, 61, was killed during a Spanish class at the school where she had taught for 40 years . After the backlash he received, the jobless defendant tweeted: 'Of all the sick things I've tweeted... it's the teacher from Leeds that outrages everyone the most' Riley, a full-time carer for a 44-year-old woman, enjoys going on Twitter for 'social banter' but does not understand the site's 'vastness', the court was told . She said: 'The offensive messages outraged the public. You had complete disregard for the tragic death of Ann Maguire. 'Besides this, countless other vile messages were made by you. The bench finds these were racially and religious aggravated. 'The offences are so serious that only a period of immediate custody can be justified.' Riley, who hid his face as he was taken down to the cells, had previously remained unapologetic following a backlash from other Twitter users. He had tweeted: 'Of all the sick things I’ve tweeted, starvation, genocide, rape and torture, it’s the teacher from Leeds that outrages everyone the most.' Prosecutor Linda Baker told the court that following a complaint to police, the defendant’s other offensive tweets had come to light. Among them were messages about the missing Malaysian plane, the Korean ferry disaster and champion tennis player Serena Williams. The court heard that, at the time of the tweets, Riley was subject to an existing community order for an unrelated offence. His solicitor Giles Hayes said Riley, a former bus driver who left school aged 15 with no qualifications, lived an insular life. He said the tweet was a 'a senseless act at a very sensitive time'. The court also heard from a report compiled by the Probation Service, which said that Riley was a full time carer for a 44-year-old woman. The report said: 'Because of this he has very little time for social activity out of the house.' A long row of flowers were left outside the Leeds school after the tragic death of the mother-of-two . Dozens of pupils also wrote tribute messages to the teacher after the killing . It said Riley regarded Twitter as a chance to engage in 'social banter' but he had 'no idea' of the site's 'vastness'. Since his arrest, the defendant - who was previously jailed for 12 weeks in 2012 - has sought help from counsellors over anger management issues relating to a 'mental nature', the court was told. Riley is the second person to be charged with the offence in the wake of Mrs Maguire's death. Jake Newsome, 21, from the Harehills area of Leeds, was released on bail after being charged for the alleged abuse, police said. He is due to appear before Leeds Magistrates' Court on May 14. West Yorkshire Police said a 16-year-old Cardiff boy had also been arrested by police on Wednesday following complaints and bailed pending a psychiatric assessment. A 15-year-old boy appeared in court last week charged with Mrs Maguire's murder and was remanded in custody. The killing is thought to be the first . time a teacher has been stabbed to death in a British classroom and the . first murder of a teacher in a school since the 1996 Dunblane massacre.

"The day Helen Galsworthy lay down across a railway line near her home, her life was at rock bottom. She’d been bullied at school, become addicted to cocaine and sunk into such a deep depression she could think of only one way out. But as she waited for a train to end her life, fate took a twist. Scroll down for video . Suicide attempt: Helen Galsworthy (above) was 18 when she walked on to the tracks close to her home in Eastleigh, Hampshire - wanting to end her life . The then 18-year-old moved slightly which meant as the thundering loco hit her it took only her legs below the knee. Now, seven years on, she is happy to tell how her suicide ploy failed and why she has found a whole new reason to live life to the full – her little boy, Thomas. Incredibly, Helen was conscious for just long enough to see her severed legs lying on the track. Thankfully, a passing dog walker found her and she was rushed to hospital. Today, 25-year-old Helen says she can finally talk about the ordeal and coming to terms with being an amputee. Doing best: Miss Galsworthy (left, aged 18; and right, now) was suffering from depression and addicted to cocaine when she tried to take her life . And she is moving on with her life after giving birth to a boy. Helen, who now lives in Chandler’s Ford, Hampshire, said: ‘When I lost my legs I thought my life was over, but now I have so much to live for. ‘Thomas has made me realise that I’m here for a reason.’ Helen had a respectable, middle class upbringing at a private school in Hampshire. But schoolyard bullying left her self-esteem in tatters, and when she was 18 she became involved with drugs and dropped out of university – where she was studying for a degree in media. At the end of her tether, she felt that suicide was the only way out. She said: ‘Strangely I felt really happy. I was more at peace than I had been for a long time. Baby Thomas: Miss Galsworthy said her son 'has made me realise that I’m here for a reason' 'I just lay down and shut my eyes and put some music on waiting for when I got hit by the train but it didn’t go to plan. 'I moved slightly at the last minute and ended up with just my legs across the tracks. ‘I just remember thinking, “Oh god, I’ve really messed this up”. 'I could see a lot of blood and the end of my jeans were cut off. It was agonising. Moving on: Miss Galsworthy, a criminology student, with her prosthetic legs at her home in Eastleigh . Family: Miss Galsworthy with her son Thomas, two, and boyfriend William Ryves, 31, at home in Eastleigh . ‘I couldn’t believe what had happened, I lay down there to die, not to end up disabled.’ After six weeks in hospital Helen was discharged, but she struggled to cope without her legs. She said: ‘I didn’t think anyone would want me and I thought I’d never be able to achieve the things I had wanted in life like getting married and having children. ‘For a long time life was unbearable until 2011 when I fell pregnant with Thomas. Thomas wasn’t planned and I thought I had put my body through too much to ever be able to conceive. ‘But I had always wanted to be a mum. His dad and I split not long after he was born but Thomas is the best thing that’s ever happened to me.’ Changed woman: After six weeks in hospital she was discharged, but struggled to cope without her legs . And now Helen – who gets around day to day on prosthetic legs – has started university again, studying for a degree in criminology. She has even taken part in a skydive to raise money for an amputee charity and volunteers on the psychiatric ward where she was once a patient. She said: ‘Losing my legs was devastating but now I’m just happy that I survived. ‘There was a time when I didn’t want to live but now I’m a mum and my life has a meaning. After I lost my legs I thought I’d be alone for ever but now I have everything I’ve ever wanted.’ Seven years later: Miss Galsworthy is a pictured with her two-year-old son Thomas at home in Eastleigh .","Helen Galsworthy attempted suicide when she walked onto train tracks .

"Fewer foreign criminals are being deported despite a pledge by David Cameron more than two years ago to ‘intervene personally’. Since 2010 there has been a spectacular fall in the number sent home after committing serious offences here. In the year of the General Election, 5,342 were deported. In 2011, in the Coalition’s second year of office, the figure was down 13 per cent to 4,649. Broken: The Prime Minister has failed to deport foreign criminals as he promised . Figures from the first three quarters of 2012 show that 3,382 were deported. If the trend continued in the final quarter, it would mean the 2012 total is around 4,509 – again, down on the previous year, and 16 per cent down on the  election year figure. Last year the number of  foreign prisoners in our jails went up. The number stood at 10,861 as of June 2012, up from 10,779 the year before. It is the first time in at least four years that the number of foreign prisoners in our jails has increased. One in eight inmates are now  foreign nationals – costing almost £500million a year to house. Failure: Labour spokesman Sadiq Khan said that Cameron's promises have rung hollow . In September 2010, Mr Cameron pledged he would ‘intervene personally’ to ensure convicted offenders are sent home to spend the rest of their sentences in their own country. In October last year the Daily Mail revealed that since the promise was made, just 62 prisoners had been returned to their home country to serve the rest of their sentences. Now the latest figures show that ministers are also failing to deport foreigners after they have served their sentences here. Labour’s justice spokesman Sadiq Khan, who obtained the figures, said: ‘David Cameron’s promises to send back thousands of foreign prisoners and to take a personal interest in this matter ring hollow. ‘Not only has he failed to send more prisoners home, but the number in our prisons has actually risen. ‘Over half a billion pounds a year is now spent on keeping foreign prisoners in our prisons, and because of Cameron’s failings, money that would be better spent elsewhere in our justice system to keep our communities safe is being wasted.’ Some 2,220 foreign offenders are in jail for violence against the person while 1,287 are sexual offenders. There are 947 robbers, 517 burglars, 738 thieves and 434 fraudsters. Some 2,110 of the foreign prisoners are there for drug offences while 105 have committed motoring offences.It costs around £45,000 a year to keep an offender in prison. The figures, released by justice minister Jeremy Wright, show that the second most common nationality of overseas prisoners is now Polish – overtaking the Irish. Jamaicans top the nationality table, with 900 last year, followed by Poland on 750, and Ireland, 737. Over the past five years, there has been a trebling of the number of Romanian offenders in our jails, even before the EU restrictions on immigration from that country and Bulgaria are lifted at the end of the year. Romanians are now the fifth most common nationality in our prisons. David Green, from the think tank Civitas, said: ‘If you have more immigration, it is not surprising that a proportion of them will be offenders.’","In 2010 5,342 were deported, but in 2012 the figure will be around 4,509 .

"A lucky terrapin has defied the odds and swum away unharmed after being tossed in the air and nearly swallowed whole by a crocodile. This series of images captures the moment the terrapin looked sure to become lunch until the crocodile discovered it was slightly too big to be eaten in one gulp. Taken at Lake Panic in Kruger National Park, the crocodile is unsuccessful at tossing the terrapin back in one bite, so then tries to crush it between its powerful jaws. However, thanks to the wet surface of its shell, the little reptile managed to slip from the crocodile's grip back into the safety of the murky water. The crocodile at Kruger National Park, in South Africa, tosses the terrapin into the air as it tries to eat it in one gulp . South African safari guide, Mario Moreno, 49, managed to capture the fleeting moment on camera despite originally visiting the area for its birdlife. Mr Moreno said: 'I was focusing particularly on a landscape shot of the lake when one of my guests alerted me to one of the crocodiles making a move. 'I quickly turned to my right and was lucky enough to get a few shots of the action. 'The crocodile was tossing the terrapin in what I believe was an attempt to put it into position and swallow it. But while doing this the terrapin slipped out of the crocodile's jaws and quickly disappeared. 'It was only about 30metres away from where we were and there didn't seem to be any visible damage. We saw the turtle later on and despite looking a little shook up, it seemed unharmed.' He added: 'I have over 15 years worth of experience as a wildlife photographer I have never seen this happen before. 'The crocs are all over the place patiently waiting for an opportunity, you could sit there for hours and the crocs would just float motionless. 'We were just lucky to be at the right place at the right time.' After its attempt to swallow the terrapin whole is unsucccessful, the crocodile then attempts to crush it in its powerful jaws . However, the terrapin's shell is too slippery and it slides out of the frustrated crocodile's mouth and away to safety . The flurry of activity was brief and ended with the crocodile (pictured) swimming away without any lunch . It was later spotted lurking partially submerged from where it would lie and wait for its next victim . The terrapin, meanwhile, was pictured relaxing on a rock after its close encounter with the giant crocodile .","A terrapin in Kruger National Park, South Africa, swims away unharmed after being tossed in the air by crocodile .

"Dr Tim Luckcock faces calls to resign after he posted this picture on Facebook . A headmaster is facing calls to resign after he posted a picture on Facebook of himself wearing a turban with the  caption: ‘Nearly gone native  in Leicester.’ Dr Tim Luckcock, 49, is head of Uplands junior school in Highfields, Leicester – a city where fewer than half of the population consider themselves white British. He is thought to have posted the picture as a joke, but it has been seized on by members of his staff who say it is ‘inappropriate’ in a ‘multi-faith school’. One member of staff, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘A pupil at the school noticed it on Facebook first and he told his mother who informed a member of staff. ‘We are all shocked and pretty  disgusted at it. Leicester is a  multi-ethnic city and the school reflects this. ‘We don’t know if this was Tim’s idea of a joke but it’s in very bad taste and has upset some pupils and their parents alike.’ A spokesman for the Leicester Sikh Alliance said: ‘We applaud anybody who is seeking a  different religious experience in  the genuine quest for understanding and appreciation. ‘But it is incumbent that such an exercise should be performed with respect and not in satire.’ Dr Luckcock, a father of two, said last night: ‘The picture was taken at a school Divali celebration more than a year ago. ‘Most members of staff were wearing similar headgear or Indian clothes. ‘I put the picture on Facebook when I thought my privacy settings were at “friends only”. ‘The story is out of its true context.

Flack, the assistant secretary of NUT in Leicester told the BBC, said: . 'I think the photograph and the comments the head teacher has made are . totally disgraceful. This is a multicultural city. 'We have multicultural schools serving all faith communities and basically what we have is a head teacher who is mocking that.'

"President Barack Obama caused quite a stir as he went for dinner at a restaurant with first lady Michelle Obama during their vacation on Martha's Vineyard yesterday. The U.S. president was greeted with crowds as he arrived at The Sweet Life Cafe in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, while waitresses lined up at the windows of a nearby Thai restaurant to take pictures of the couple as they left. The Obamas are in the middle of a two-week vacation on the island, from where he has had to deal with global crises involving Iraq, Gaza, Syria and terrorism and Ebola in Africa. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama leave The Sweet Life Cafe after having dinner on Tuesday night . Staff at a Thai restaurant next door line up at the windows to watch as the Obamas leave The Sweet Life Cafe . A crowd gathers to vie for a glimpse of President Barack Obama as he arrives for dinner at The Sweet Life Cafe with first lady Michelle Obama . President Obama was pictured last night waving to crowds as he left The Sweet Life Cafe with his wife. Earlier in the day it was reported that Hillary Clinton had mended fences with the president and 'looks forward to hugging it out' at a party just days after an interview was published in which she had harsh words for his handling of the crisis in Syria. Speaking last week to The Atlantic, the former secretary of state said Obama's 'failure' to arm rebels opposed to dictator Bashar al-Assad 'left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.' She was referring to the murderous terror group ISIS, which has left a swath of death and destruction in its wake as it plows through Iraq and claims to have established an Islamic caliphate. A Clinton spokesman, however, said Tuesday that she had 'called President Obama to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his leadership.' The statement, delivered first to Politico, acknowledged that Clinton and Obama have 'had honest differences on some issues, including aspects of the wicked challenge Syria presents.' President Obama was pictured last night waving to crowds as he left The Sweet Life Cafe with his wife . President Barack Obama is currently on vacation on the island of Martha's Vineyard . Hillary Clinton signs copies of her book Hard Choices in Huntington, New York last Wednesday. Clinton will be in Martha's Vineyard this week for another book signing . But '[l]ike any two friends who have to deal with the public eye, she looks forward to hugging it out when  they see each other tomorrow night.' That could take the edge off of what may otherwise have been an awkward encounter at a party this evening on Martha's Vineyard. The event will honour Ann Jordan, wife of Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan. Clinton, also a former first lady and senator from New York, served as Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Since then she has been touring the country giving a series of lucrative speeches and promoting her memoir, Hard Choices. She will be on Martha's Vineyard to sign copies of her book today and is expected to meet Obama at the party tonight.","Obamas were greeted with crowds as they left restaurant during vacation .

"Colonialist: David Tennant's Doctor Who with Freema Agyeman as his first black companion, Martha Jones . Through all his incarnations, Doctor Who has fought selflessly to ensure the survival of all manner of life forms across the Universe. But now an international group of academics has branded the heroic Time Lord ‘thunderingly racist’. The Doctor’s new foes claim that his dismissive attitude towards black companions, his contempt  for ‘primitive’ people, and even his passion for cricket are all proof of a reactionary ‘whiteness’ pervading his adventures. Their concerns are published in a new book, Doctor Who And Race, which says the BBC programme is based in attitudes ‘that continue to subjugate people of colour’. But fans dismiss such criticisms as ‘groundless’ and ‘ridiculous’. One of the more bizarre theories  is offered by Amit Gupta, an American professor, who argues that Peter Davison’s cricket-loving incarnation of the character in the Eighties was thinly disguised nostalgia for the British Empire. He wrote: ‘[He]  portrayed the amateur English cricketer of the late 19th Century when the game was characterised by both racial and class distinctions. ‘Cricket also had a role in maintaining the status of British imperialism through the exercise of soft power as it was successfully inculcated by the colonial elites. Davison’s cricketing Doctor once again saw the BBC using Who to promote a racial and class nostalgia that had already outlived its validity.’ Several of the 23 contributors to the book lament the failure to cast a black or Asian actor as the Doctor. And in earlier series, white actors were cast as other ethnicities. Singled out for criticism is a 1977 storyline, The Talons Of Weng- Chiang, set in Victorian times and featuring the white actor John Bennett as a Chinese villain. Nostalgia for empire: Peter Davison's cricket-loving Time Lord takes on the Daleks . There is also an attack on the ‘second-class’ treatment of black characters such as Martha Jones in more recent episodes. A feminist contributor with the pen name Fire Fly, says the Doctor’s relationship with Martha, who was played by Freema Agyeman, is proof of the ‘white  perspective’ of the series. She singles out a 2007 episode set in Elizabethan London when Martha  voices her fears that she might be sold into slavery, only to be told by David Tennant’s Doctor that she should ‘walk about like you own the place. It works for me’. Fire Fly wonders why the Doctor will depose tyrannical alien regimes but will not challenge human slavery.  And she claims the exchange ‘betrays the ignorance of writers about historical racial violence and contemporary white privilege’. There is further criticism of the introduction and Adolf Hitler as a character last year, which was condemned as ‘comic-book’ and ‘slapstick’, and did nothing to increase understanding of the Holocaust. The Doctor also dismisses as primitive any civilisation that doesn’t share his belief in scientific progress – which the academic critics say is a very ‘West European’ attitude. In the show’s very first story, William Hartnell’s Doctor compares the disbelief of his new companions when they first enter the Tardis with the Red Indian ‘whose savage mind disbelieved steam trains’. And the introduction of the ‘savage’ – and scantily-clad – companion Leela in the 1970s is offered as further proof of the Time Lord’s inherent racism since she was treated as being ‘more primitive than us’. Runaway success: The latest Doctor Who Matt Smith, with sidekick Jenna-Louise Coleman . Australian academic Lindy Orthia, who compiled the anthology, concluded: ‘The biggest elephant in the room is the problem privately nursed by many fans of loving a TV show when it is thunderingly racist.’ But fans dismissed her criticisms. Sebastian J Brook, editor of Doctor Who Online, said the show ‘embraced rather than divided’. He added: ‘I think the suggestion the show is racist is ridiculous. Doctor treated Martha Jones no differently from the way he treated any other character.’ And the BBC said: ‘Doctor Who has a strong track record of diverse casting among both regular and guest cast. Freema Agyeman became the first black companion and Noel Clarke starred in a major role for five years [Mickey Smith]. ‘Reflecting the diversity of the UK is a duty of the BBC, and casting on Doctor Who is colour-blind. It is always about the best actors for the roles.’ Doctor Who and RaceEdited by Lindy Orthia, is published by Intellect Books and is priced at £19.95.

"As an experienced speaker on the international debating circuit, I have fended off countless heckles from both men and women. But I have never experienced anything like the misogynistic insults hurled at me by a group of male students during the finals of the Glasgow University Union (GUU) Ancients Debate last week. I was booed and subjected to cries of ‘shame woman’ from the moment I stood up to discuss the motion, ‘This house regrets the centralisation of religion’, with my debate partner, Marlena Valles. Line of fire: Rebecca Meredith believes misogyny is on the rise among educated men . After the debate, we confronted both the individuals involved. When Marlena approached one of the young men, he shouted: ‘Get that woman out of my union.’ Female . audience members who came to our defence were shouted down with more . demeaning abuse and the retort: ‘What does a woman know anyway.’ One was . even called a ‘frigid bitch’. We . later discovered the gang had openly discussed our appearance and made . lewd sexual comments about the size of our breasts and body shapes. Sadly, this behaviour is not limited to one ugly debate with a renegade group of boorish students. Indeed, . what I have discovered is that this influence has spread across a . generation of men – though, of course, not all of them. Reaction to the incident from the wider world also indicates this is not an isolated incident and that this sort of behaviour is occurring regularly in a much wider arena.

It ranges from a columnist in The Spectator who said women simply were not cut out for ‘the rough and tumble of dialectic free-for-all’, to a repulsive internet forum where members discussed in graphic detail the ways in which they would rape me. Marlena and I were so alarmed by this experience that we decided to see if other female debaters had suffered similar abuse. So we created an anonymous survey, asking women for their experiences of misogyny on the debate circuit. Within two days we had received 200 responses from women around the world who had endured various forms of misogyny. We were building a picture indicating that, though many young men are hugely supportive of women, some display worrying misogyny. Worse still, outside the world of debating there are those who think nothing of posting on the internet terrifying and often violent threats towards women they have never met, and happily discuss on forums how they will ‘bag the next honey’ on a Saturday night by plying her with alcohol. How on earth did this happen? And why? Years ago such behaviour was regarded as not merely ungentlemanly but a symbol of the yob. How has it now become acceptable among some well-educated young men? What has heralded this tide of fury and disregard for women? After all, these men must have mothers, sisters or girlfriends. Yet they seem to find the topics of rape and abuse hilarious, or worse, typical ‘water-cooler conversation’. A Google search brings up several forums and Facebook pages where members discuss ways in which they would rape various women in the news . I fear it may be a reaction to the way in which feminism is regarded today. It has become a dirty word among many people in my generation. Has the constant bombardment of society with sexual imagery and the ready availability of online porn trivialised and demeaned sex to the extent that we are no longer revolted when individuals are openly graded on everything from their attractiveness to their rape potential? Perhaps the worst moment of the past week for me was the discovery of an unofficial internet chat forum for British Forces members, where young men posted my picture before going on to discuss how they would rape me – in disturbingly graphic detail. They wrote that I was a ‘debating f**k doll’ and ‘it would take grappling hooks and crowbars to get me off her’. One threatened he would silence me using ‘a knife against her neck and my bony fingers scrabbling around inside her underwear’. The post has now been taken down. In another post on the same forum, a picture of a larger woman carries the headline, ‘Would you rape this?’ One man responds: ‘Only if I had the right kit.’ These websites are not hard to find on the internet. On another forum, one member chillingly asks advice on how to ‘properly rape a woman’ without leaving any evidence. He adds he would ‘probably kill her’ if he did leave any trace on her body, musing that the ‘world doesn’t need so many women, so I’m probably helping out’. There are pages and pages of responses to this post with suggestions ranging from ‘buy a taxi and modify it so she can’t get out’ to simply ‘smash her face in and then do your dirty deed’. One member suggests that the user ‘checks out’ another thread on how to dispose of a body. There is even a Wikipedia-style site with detailed instructions on ‘how to become a rapist’. When quizzed about this behaviour, would the men argue, as some did after the GUU debate, that ‘they are only joking’? It is a worrying trend. Hundreds of female students have been in touch with me in the past week, claiming to have experienced far worse treatment from their counterparts than me. Several wrote to me from Glasgow saying they had been called whores when trying to speak in debates. Others wrote about ‘Fat Girl Rodeos’ – a game played by male students in student unions around the country. According to several blogs and posts on Facebook, male students ‘grab a girl, tell her they are going to rape her, and see how long they can hold on’. Others said they had been told they won their debating competitions because judges wanted to have sex with them, or that they should wear a short skirt to get ahead. One woman said she had decided to quit debating after being told that speakers wouldn’t be able to concentrate on what she said because they’d be too busy staring at her ample chest. At the GUU debate, a female former committee member revealed she had adopted ‘battered wife syndrome’. She had become so used to sexism she just put up with it to remain in her position at her union. Terrifyingly, another claimed to have been told to ‘keep quiet’ after being sexually assaulted. I have repeatedly been told by debaters that women should speak more quietly than men on the grounds that loud men sound more persuasive, while females who raise their voices merely sound hysterical. Either that or they are experiencing their ‘time of the month’. After the debate, some men posted on Facebook that the culprits’ comments were just ‘banter’. But how far do we let ‘banter’ go? Do we allow these young men, who are not uneducated thugs, but future leaders, lawyers and fathers, to call women ‘frigid bitches’? Some commentators have tried to claim that Marlena and I are fighting ‘a feminist cause’. But what on earth does this mean? All we want is the chance to be judged on what we have to say, rather than our gender. There is obviously still a need for feminism. But that term is now toxic for many of my generation. Some disaffected young men associate the word with ‘hairy lesbians’, ‘bra-burning lunatics’ and ‘man-haters’. In truth, I would describe myself as a feminist. But if a man on the street asked me this question I would hesitate to say I was, unless there was time for further conversation where I could define what I mean. Otherwise I would fear being misunderstood based on a stereotype. Last week, a study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council revealed that the term feminism had provoked unease and even hostility from several groups of women interviewed in both Britain and Germany. Researcher Dr Christina Scharff of King’s College, London, said the young women she had spoken to, from a variety of backgrounds, had been united in rejecting feminism. ‘Young women want to be treated equally and are aware of gender inequalities,’ she said. ‘Yet, even in countries that see themselves as being progressive on gender and sexuality, the term is often met with suspicion.’ Perhaps it is because today the term has come to be associated with ‘women’s rights gone too far’. Yet it is clear from events over the past week that, on the contrary, we still have a very long way to go. None of the young women I know are extreme. But we all wonder why, when someone is sexist, misogynist, or even threatens us with rape, that society can excuse it as a joke. It shouldn’t be forgotten that many men face physical abuse from their female partners, but casual sexism remains most commonly directed at women. There are no websites or forums for women to discuss how to rape young men they have never met. The true tragedy is that women often stay silent when they come  up against this sort of appalling abuse at work and at home, even when faced with the experience of the  ‘Fat Girl Rodeo’. This silence needs to be broken. I hope the GUU enacts reform. It owes it to the young women who have given up debating because they have been booed down when men have not. But it is not just the world of debating that needs to take a long, hard look at itself. We all do. Because when we excuse the kind of sexist behaviour being experienced by hundreds of women around the world as ‘banter’, we have no way of moderating what is acceptable. This experience won’t put me off debating. If anything it has made me more determined to hold a mirror up to those who degrade women. So let’s have a debate about sexism, not just in debating, but in society – preferably without prioritising the size of someone’s breasts over their ideas. All those in favour say ‘aye’. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Rebecca Meredith heckled during debate at Glasgow University Union .

"The United States government's accumulated debts have grown by more than $7 trillion – with a 't' – since Barack Obama became president on January 20, 2009. The sad milestone was revealed on July 31 by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on a 'debt to the penny' website that calculates the debt at the end of every business day. On Obama's first day in office the debt stood at $10.626 trillion. Last Thursday it reached $17.687 trillion. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Somber salute to the economy? When Barack Obama came home from Camp David on Sunday, the nation was $7 trillion poorer than it was when he first arrived at the White House on January 20, 2009 . Up, up, up: The national debt has grown steadily during the Obama years, jumping by a total of $7 trillion as of July 31 . America's first 43 presidents took 223 years to rack up the country's first $7 trillion in red ink. Obama has duplicated that dubious achievement in less than five years and seven months. After the same number of days in office, former President George W. Bush had increased the national debt by a comparatively paltry $2.720 trillion. Bill Clinton's debt load at the same point in his presidency had increased by just $1,324 trillion. The right-leaning Cybercast News Service was first to point out that Obama had cleared the $7 trillion hurdle in added financial obligations. During a July 2008 campaign speech in North Dakota, then-Senator Obama ripped into the Bush administration for running up the federal debt by a total of $4 billion near the end of his second term. 'The problem is,' he said, 'is that the way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children, driving up our national debt from $5 trillion for the first 42 presidents – #43 added $4 trillion by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back – $30,000 for every man, woman and child.' 'That’s irresponsible,' Obama said then. 'It’s unpatriotic.' The Republican Party ripped into the president on Monday with an email blast . charging that after '[i]gnoring warnings from all corners, Obama has . one of the worst records on the federal debt in U.S. history.' The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for a response. In February the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 'federal debt held by the public will equal 74 percent of GDP at the end of this year and 79 percent in 2024.' At the end of 2008, that number was just 39 per cent. At current rates of spending, by 2019 the debt will be larger than the nation's annual GDP. Contrast: In their combined 12 years in office, the two Presidents Bush added a total of $7.4 trillion to the national debt -- a number Obama will equal after six years . 'Such large and growing federal debt,' the CBO warns, 'could have serious negative consequences, including restraining economic growth in the long term, giving policymakers less flexibility to respond to unexpected challenges, and eventually increasing the risk of a fiscal crisis.' Debt held by the public makes up about 71 per cent of the total federal debt. The rest consists of 'intragovernmental holdings' – government-speak for gaps in the Medicare Trust Fund, the Social Security Trust Fund, and other revolving funds. Those lines on Uncle Sam's balance sheet totaled $5,036 trillion at the end of last Thursday, a number that represents how far behind the government is in meeting its long-term obligations to retirees and other benefit-takers. Government spending has skyrocketed during Obama's time in office due to a combinations of his policies, a spendthrift Congress and recession-related automatic stabilizers like unemployment insurance that can quickly drain the Treasury. The annual deficit – a single year's addition to the larger debt – was $1.413 trillion in 2009, Obama's first year in the White House. He has steadily reduced it year-on-year, and the 2014 deficit is expected to be $492 billion. That number, however, is still larger than any other annual deficit in the history of the U.S. before he became president.","Total federal government debt has increased by 66 per cent since Barack Obama became president .

"It was either a technical snafu or a masterful bit of diplomatic showmanship, but either way former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren escaped a question Monday about his nation's reported eavesdropping on U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Appearing on MSNBC via live remote from Tel Aviv, the career diplomat spent most of his interview complaining about America's responses to Israel's military campaign in Gaza. But then Mitchell shifted gears. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren suddenly lost communications with MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell at the very moment she asked him a tough question about Israel's eavesdropping on Secretary of State John Kerry . Deer in the headlights: Oren said he had no audio feed but answered 'I'm in Tel Aviv' when Mitchell asked, 'Can you still hear us in Tel Avia?' 'I just have to ask you very briefly, in ten seconds,' she said: 'Were you aware of any eavesdropping on John Kerry by Israeli intelligence?' After a deer-in-the-headlights moment complete with eye-blinks, he said, 'Andrea, I cannot hear you, I’m sorry.' 'Michael Oren,' she asked, 'can you still hear us? In Tel Aviv?' 'I'm in Tel Aviv,' he answered – a response that suggests he could hear her after all. But then, with a hand to his earpiece, Oren insisted that 'I cannot hear you. I'm sorry,' . 'Okay,' Mitchell said, wrapping up. 'We'll clarify that later. Thank you very much.' According to a report published Monday in the German newsweekly Der Spiegel, Israeli intelligence services wiretapped Kerry and spied on his conversations in 2013 as he was trying to piece together a peace agreement with negotiating partners in the region. Some of his calls, according to Der Spiegel, 'were not made on encrypted equipment, but instead on normal telephones, with the conversations transmitted by satellite.' 'Intelligence agencies intercepted some of those calls.' Kerry's . failed negotiations in 2013 added strain to an already worrisome . relationship between the U.S. and Israel as Kerry and Prime Minister . Benjamin Netanyahu were increasingly at odds.

Hamas, the U.S.-designated terror group claiming to represent Palestinians' interests, has lobbed hundreds of rockets into Israel in recent weeks, and the Jewish state responded with a ground incursion into Gaza. Israel dismantled or destroyed dozens of 'terror tunnels' in the process, reportedly crippling Hamas' ability to strike inside Israeli territory. Oren, now free from the constraints of his former diplomatic station, expressed disappointment with what he said was a lack of support from the U.S. 'I personally expect more from our allies, particularly the United States,' he told Mitchell before his audio feed went on the blink, 'to understand that we are in a desperate struggle with a terrorist group.' Hamas, Oren said, 'is using the civilian population as a human shield [and] is trying to destroy this country, an ally of the United States – in fact, an organization that is no different than al-Qaeda, no different than an ISIS, that seeks to destroy the civilization of which America is a part.' Kerry in particular has raised the hackles of government officials in Israel because of his efforts at mediation, with hostile media reports there claiming he and the U.S. have tried to negotiate a peace agreement that favors Hamas.","Michael Oren may have feigned technical difficulties in order to escape a tough interview question .

"David Cameron’s assault on cheap alcohol descended into a fiasco last night within hours of its launch. Drinks firms threatened legal action over the Prime Minister’s controversial plans to tackle the scourge of binge-drinking by imposing a minimum price of about 40p per unit on alcoholic drinks. They claim the proposal is illegal under EU competition law. Some ministers are also understood to fear that the strategy could fall foul of the courts. Public health minister Anne Milton recently told MPs that minimum pricing was ‘illegal’ while Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, is also believed to have warned Cabinet colleagues that it may breach European rules. Tackling the scourge: The idea behind minimum pricing is to increase the price of super-strength ciders, cheap vodka and special brew lagers to dissuade binge-drinking and reduce its toll on health services, police and society in general . Mr Cameron (left) stood accused of bringing forward the plans to distract from George Osborne's budget. Alan Johnson (right) revealed he was repeatedly told such a strategy would be against the law . Alan Johnson, Labour’s former Home Secretary, revealed yesterday that he had considered imposing a minimum alcohol price when he was in office – but was repeatedly told by government legal advisers it would be against both British and European law. Last night Mr Cameron stood accused of hurriedly bringing forward the alcohol strategy in an attempt to distract attention from George Osborne’s Budget, which has been attacked from all sides for imposing a ‘granny tax’ on pensioners. The announcement had been pencilled in for next Monday, but it was instead unveiled to a half-empty House of Commons yesterday – highly unusual as MPs are usually in their constituencies on Fridays. Indeed, this was only the fourth time in ten years that a minister has made an announcement to the house on a Friday – previous occasions tackled the more urgent topics of Libya, swine flu and Iraq. The idea behind minimum pricing is to increase the price of super-strength ciders, cheap vodka and special brew lagers to dissuade binge-drinking and reduce its toll on health services, police and society in general. Announcing the plans yesterday, Home . Secretary Theresa May even suggested that the minimum price could end up . being as high as 50p a unit. But critics say it will punish responsible drinkers on low incomes at a time of austerity. Last night Gavin Partington, of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, which represents drinks producers, warned the Government to prepare for a court battle, saying: ‘We think this is going to lead ultimately to legal challenges. Minimum pricing is illegal under European laws. ‘It would be a drinks company taking the case, or perhaps a group of drinks companies. It is too early to say at the moment... but looking at case law, there is every reason to believe it is illegal.’ Article 34 of the EU Treaty says countries cannot impose restrictions on trade between countries. In 1978, the European Court of Justice ruled that Dutch legislation setting out minimum prices for certain spirits was illegal as it placed imports at a disadvantage. The Coalition’s alcohol strategy also includes plans to ban buy-one-get-one-free alcohol deals and other bulk discounts. Mrs May said: ‘This strategy is . targeted explicitly at dangerous drinkers, problem pubs, irresponsible . shops and harmful drinks. Those who enjoy a quiet drink or two have . nothing to fear from our proposals. The local pub has nothing to fear, . the responsible off-licence has nothing to fear. ‘This is a comprehensive strategy to . take back our town centres from the drunken thugs and to restore them to . the law-abiding majority.’ But . Tory backbencher Philip Davies said: ‘It’s gesture politics of the . worst kind, it’s the Nanny State running riot. It’s a tax on poorer . people – it won’t affect the price David Cameron pays for a bottle of . wine.’ Legal threat: Drinks firms say imposing a minimum price of about 40p per unit on alcoholic drinks is illegal under EU competition law . Fellow Tory MP Nigel Mills said there was a danger minimum pricing would lead to a surge in black-market alcohol brought over from the Continent. Sam Bowman, head of research at the Right-wing Adam Smith Institute, said: ‘Minimum alcohol pricing is anti-fun Victorian paternalism, and the Government is engaged in a misguided moral crusade against drinking.’ However, the plans were welcomed by health professionals and the police. A Downing Street source said Mr Cameron was confident that minimum pricing was legal, stating: ‘There has been a big misunderstanding about this. If we were setting a market price in order to protect our domestic industry then that would be illegal, but that is not what we are doing.’","David Cameron's plans to tackle the scourge of binge-drinking descend into chaos with hours of launch .

"A police officer who stole £6,000 from her mother's partner as part of a credit card fraud has been jailed for failing to carry out her community service. Natalie Scott, who served as a PC with Cumbria Constabulary, was sentenced to seven weeks in prison after admitting she didn't carry out the unpaid work she had been ordered to do. The 37-year-old, from Barrow, sobbed as she was handcuffed and taken to the cells by security after the sentence was passed down at Furness Magistrates' Court. Natalie Scott, left, who stole £6,000 from her mother's partner's credit card. The former police officer, right, took the card while in uniform and on duty . In August of this year, Scott pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation after pocketing a credit card belonging to her mother's partner, Christopher McKeilor, while visiting their home while in uniform and on duty. The court heard how she tried to use the card to pay for a £6,000 trip for four to Dubai, but the transaction did not go through. She later used the card at Manchester Airport and settled the bill for the 10-day holiday. The victim then received a phone call from his bank, explaining there had been a transaction which took his card over the limit. Scott was arrested two days after she returned from the holiday. In mitigation, the court heard the crimes came 'out of desperation' and were a 'spur-of-the-moment stupid decision'. She was handed a suspended sentence of eight weeks, ordered to repay the money and to perform 200 hours of unpaid work - as well as losing her job with the Cumbria force after 12 years. Yesterday, Brian Carruthers of Cumbria Probation Trust told the court that Scott had completed just 38 hours of unpaid work and had failed to attend a scheduled appointment as instructed on October 22. Sean Harkin, defending, said Scott had struggled to carry out the community service after starting a new full-time job with internet company UK Domains in Ulverston, Cumbria. At Furness Magistrates' Court, pictured, Scott was sentenced to seven weeks in prison after admitting she failed to carry out her community service . Mr Harkin said: 'She's keen to impress her new employer by working as much as she possibly can and afterwards she has phoned her probation officer to explain why she has been unable to attend.' He added that Scott intended to work the remaining hours once she had been employed long enough to earn annual leave and added that she is the sole carer for her six-year-old son. Chris Harris, the presiding magistrate, handed Scott a seven week prison sentence, telling her that her time in custody had been reduced to take into account the hours she had already worked. Mr Harris said: 'You will gather from the amount of time we have been out that we have talked at length about whether to activate your sentence. 'We saw in you, frankly, quite a lack of remorse. There was an attitude of ""when I accrue some holidays I will be able to fit it in"". 'It doesn't work like that, Miss Scott, and you know that.'","Natalie Scott admitted fraudulently using her mother's partner's credit card .

"Juan Mata has urged Manchester United to step up their bid for a top-four place, admitting it is hard watching their rivals play in the Champions League this season while Louis van Gaal’s side are excluded from Europe’s elite. Mata moved to Old Trafford from Chelsea in a £37.1million deal a year ago this week but was unable to help his new club finish any higher than seventh after their disappointing season under David Moyes. It meant that United missed out on Champions League football for the first time in 19 years, and their place in the top-four is once again under threat from a chasing pack after a run of two wins from their last six league games. Juan Mata has urged Manchester United to step up their bid for a top-four place this season . Mata (left) admits it is hard to watch United's rivals play in the Champions League this term, as they miss out . Mata warned that Van Gaal’s side are entering a decisive stage of the season as they prepare to meet bottom club Leicester City at Old Trafford on Saturday, and must go on a winning streak to avoid another season of frustration. ‘It’s difficult watching the games on TV every Tuesday and Wednesday,’ said the Spain midfielder. ‘It’s the thought that we all have in our minds that we need to be back in the Champions League. ‘It’s the most attractive competition in the world – we need to be there again. ‘This is our main objective for this season, to play Champions league football again because I think this club should always play in the Champions League. ‘It is going to be a fight until the end and not just between two teams. It will be between three, four, five teams, that we are now in a short difference of points. Mata joined United for £37.1million from Chelsea in January 2014, as United finished seventh in the league . ‘We know we are arriving into a crucial moment for the season. The last months, the last 10 or 15 games probably, are the most important. We know we have to perform. ‘It’s very important, not just to win the games against your big rivals but also the weaker teams. If you want to be in the top four at the end of the season, you have to win almost every game. It doesn’t matter if it’s Leicester City or Manchester City. We have to go into the games trying to win.’ Asked why the goals have dried up in recent weeks, with United scoring just five times in their last six games in all competitions, Mata replied: ‘I don’t know why. I’m sure we will create chances again and I’m sure we will score goals again because we have very good strikers and very good midfielders. The chances will come for sure, hopefully this Saturday. ‘We’ve played very good football in some games, especially in November and December. We have to look back at how we did it and to do it again – because I think we can do it. ‘The way the manager wants to play is attractive for the fans and attractive for the players. I really like it. It’s just a matter of doing it how he wants.’ Mata was on the scoresheet (right) as United won 3-0 against fierce rivals Liverpool in December . Mata has settled in among a growing number of Spanish speaking players at Old Trafford following United’s £150m transfer spending last summer. He added: ‘Sunday was one year exactly. Obviously last season was not the best year in the history of the club but I’m very happy here. ‘I’ve scored some goals, I’ve assisted on with some goals. I’m looking forward to doing it more and more and trying to help the team get back to fighting for the title. This is what we have to do.’ The arrival of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera has increased the competition for places among United’s Gaalacticos. It has led to problems accommodating them all but Mata insists that he is happy with his playing time this season. Angel di Maria (right) is one of many Spanish speakers at Old Trafford, along with Mata . ‘He is trying is to put the players in positions for the sake of the team,’ said the 26-year-old. ‘Obviously we have a lot of players and it’s difficult for him to figure out how to do it. ‘I guess it has to be difficult for the manager to choose from all the players we have, especially in attack. But I think it is also good for him because he has so many options. ‘He is experienced enough to handle it. For me personally, I feel very good and I’m just trying to help the team with my qualities. ‘I think you have to see it after the season has gone to see how many games I play, to see how important I was for the team. I feel important and I’ve played a lot of games so far so I’m happy. ‘There is a lot of competition for the first XI in the team, not just for me, so I’m happy that I’ve played a lot of games and I’m looking forward to playing more before the end of the season.’ Juan Mata was speaking at the launch of Swissquote, Manchester United's first global Official Forex and Online Trading Partner.","Manchester United finished seventh in the Premier League last season .

"A couple have been arrested for violently beating their four adopted children and forcing them to perform sex acts in a disturbing catalogue of abuse which police say amounts to torture. Aubrey Thomas, 58, and his wife Laura, 47, have been accused of forcing the children to throw up and eat their own vomit, beating them with a large paddle called 'Mr Awesome' and than making them soak in a bath of ice to reduce swelling from the abuse. Investigators described the family's Oklahoma home, where the two girls and two boys now aged between 13 and 15 lived, as a 'house of horrors'. Accused: Laura Thomas, 47, left, and Aubrey Thomas, 58, right has been accused of violently beating sexually abusing their four adopted children . The children said they were sexually abused, claiming they were . forced to eat gum off Aubrey Thomas' penis and made to perform oral . sex on their adoptive siblings in exchange for food. The Thomas' also allegedly forced them to put urine soaked underwear in their mouths if they wet the bed . and forced them to eat horse manure for not cleaning a horse pen, reports News9.com. The couple is facing a series of child abuse charges. The couple, who lived in Rogers County, became foster parents in 2001 and took in six children. In 2003, the Oklahoma Department of Human Services removed two of the children from their home after finding evidence of abuse, Osage County Undersheriff Lou Ann Brown told Tulsa World. But the couple were able to keep the other four children and moved to Osage County west of Sperry in 2006. Investigators described the family's Oklahoma home, pictured, where the two girls and two boys now aged between 13 and 15 lived, as a 'house of horrors' In October, the Osage County Sheriff's Office was called in to investigate after one of the girls, who had been put into a psychiatric facility, revealed the allegations to a counselor, reports the Tulsa World. Investigators say the home schooled children, who were all found to be malnourished, were coached not to say anything about the alleged abuse. Osage County sheriff's investigator Justin Kling's reports says the girls, particularly, were singled out for 'heinous abuse', reports the Tulsa World. Kling was able to track down a biological daughter of the Thomas' who had moved away in 2008. She echoed the stories of abuse. 'It's probably one of the worst cases that I know of that's happened . around here in a long time,' Brown told News9.com. 'To treat a child like that is beyond my imagination.' The four children are now in protective custody. The DHS released a statement to News9.com saying: 'We are rigorously reviewing this case to find any mistakes made by our agency or others during the years of involvement with this family. 'This is absolutely intolerable. It is our mission to protect children and we will take whatever corrective action is needed to ensure this does not happen in the future.'","Aubrey and Laura Thomas allegedly beat the kids with a large paddle called 'Mr Awesome' and forced them to eat manure .

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is either preparing a presidential campaign announcement or executing a 4,000 square foot head-fake in Midtown Manhattan with an office rental that was made public on Tuesday.

'And two dozen office staff isn't even enough people to pass out the walking-around money, much less run a campaign like that.' Clinton also has office space at her family foundation's office near Rockefeller Center, just five blocks away. 'This . could just be Hillary's way of putting some distance between her . personal office and the Clinton Foundation,' the consultant added, 'in . case there are issues with the nonprofit housing some of her for-profit . stuff like book-signing tours and all of that.' 'You really don't want to cross the IRS when you're gearing up to run for president.' Clinton . also seized the opportunity to cozy up to New York City's Democratic . establishment when choosing an office. The building where she signed a . lease is owned by the brother of Mark Green, the party's mayoral . candidate who lost to Michael Bloomberg in 2001. HollywoodLife reported that Clinton's new suite includes nine offices, 14 workstations and a large conference room. The building features 53 parking spaces, although Clinton's Secret Service detail may just elect to idle on the curb. The ground floor features a swanky Bobby Van's steakhouse. SL Green Realty Corp. boasts that 'a major capital improvement program was completed in 2011 with renovations to the outdoor plaza and lobby, which feature magnificent large scale hanging lit sculptures' and a 'cascading water wall.' Clinton, whose poll numbers have dipped since the release of her memoirs, is expected to announce by year's end whether or not she will seek the White House. If she stays out of the race, a personal office in the Big Apple could help her differentiate her activities from her lecherous husband's personal brand in their declining years.","Gossip website started a Hillarywatch brush fire Tuesday with a breathless report claiming it had stumbled onto Clinton's presidential HQ .

"A party of 22 alleged Nazi fanatics have gone on trial in Italy for celebrating Hitler's birthday in a bar . A group of 22 alleged Nazi fanatics have gone on trial in Italy for throwing a party to celebrate Hitler’s birthday. The festivities included singing songs celebrating the death of Anne Frank and the Jews, investigators say. The group are accused of propaganda and inciting ethnic and racial hatred. The alleged party in April 2007 was thrown in a popular beer garden on the picturesque shores of Lake Buguggiate, in the foothills of the Alps. Among the accused is the owner of the bar Franco Lattuada, a local councillor in Silvio Berlusconi's People of Liberty party. He denies that the party took place. The revellers allegedly sang bastardised versions of traditional Italian songs with shocking refrains such as ‘Six million Jews, do it again,’ as well as Heil Hitler. They also sang hymns to notorious Nazis including fomer SS officer Erich Priebke who was convicted of taking part in Italy’s most emotional war crime, the massacre of 335 Italians in the Ardeantine caves outside Rome in 1944. Undercover police filmed inside the bar, which normally serves German-style sausage and beer, on hidden cameras. The footage, described by the prosecution as ‘shocking’, will be broadcast in the courtroom during the trial. Officers also seized propaganda leaflets, and other Nazi paraphernalia including pictures of Hitler, Nazi flags, posters from the fascist era and a dagger. Among the accused is the owner of the bar Franco Lattuada, a local councillor in Silvio Berlusconi's (pictured) People of Liberty party. He denies that the party took place . Police are thought to have been extra . vigilant because celebrations of the Fuhrer’s birthday have often been . linked to violent attacks. In 2011 a gang of neo-Nazis in Russia were convicted of raping and dismembering a suspected police informant while celebrating the grim anniversary. Neo-Nazism has surged in Italy in the last decade largely due to the growing threat from Islamic terrorism.
