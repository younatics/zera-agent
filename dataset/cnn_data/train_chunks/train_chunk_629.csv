The trend for taking 'selfies' - photos of yourself - has taken photo-sharing site Instagram by storm - and now the phenomenon has been given a makeover thanks to a concept camera with two halves. The DUO camera, designed by an engineering student from London, has two sides joined together by magnets. A couple, or group of people, can separate the two halves and take photos simultaneously of each other or themselves. The two shots are then joined together in a single image, making sure no-one in the group is left out. Scroll down for video . A London-based engineering student has designed a concept camera with two halves, joined together by magnets. The DUO device lets couples or groups take photos simultaneously to make sure the photo taker is included in the shot . When one shutter on one half of the DUO camera is pressed, both cameras take a picture. The two shots are put together, into a single photo, separated by a line down the middle, pictured . There are two buttons on each of the two halves, which are joined together by a pair of magnets. One button controls the shutter. The other turns the dual camera mode on or off. With the mode enabled, when one shutter presses, both cameras take a picture. The two shots are put together into a single photo, separated by a line down the middle. The camera is the brainchild of student Chin-Wei Liao, who is currently studying engineering at the Royal College of Art in London. He wanted to develop a system that meant the person taking the photograph was not excluded from group shots. Beginning with two large boxes fitted with lenses, triggers and shutters, Liao developed his prototype into a handheld device. Each camera half has a synchronised trigger which means that the photographers don't have to press the button together - one person can control both cameras. When one trigger is pressed, both halves capture whatever is in front of the respective lens. The two shots are then put together into a single photo separated by a line down the middle. The camera can also be switched to single camera mode and used like a traditional camera. The DUO prototype began as two large boxes fitted with cameras and triggers. Liao developed the camera so it was easier to hold in one hand and presented the concept camera as his final project at the Royal College of Art's Innovation Design Engineering program . Liao's blog said: 'Put yourself in the photos you take. An engaging and inclusive photo-taking experience. 'When browsing through old photos, we have stronger memory connection and emotion projection while seeing photos with ourselves inside. 'However, documenting the presence of self is not an easy task and there is usually one person has to be excluded from photos taken in social events. 'DUO is a separable camera with synchronised triggers to captures the moment. The two halves of the DUO camera are joined together by magnets. There are then two buttons on each of the two halves. One button controls the shutter. The other turns the dual camera mode on or off. In single camera mode the DUO can be used like a traditional camera . 'It invites people to engage the photo-taking process; by being both photographer and subject at the same time, it enables people to have fun documenting and being documented. 'Inspired by the fact that many people feel uncomfortable being photographed or do not like seeing their self-images, this project explored the meaningful impact of self-image and ways of encouraging people to enjoy taking photos.' Liao calls it a 'binary camera' and he developed the camera as part of his final project at RCA's Innovation Design Engineering program. There are no plans to release the camera commercially.","The two halves of the DUO concept camera are connected by magnets .

Prosecutors are investigating how a man certified as dead got elected mayor of a village in southern Mexico. Authorities say relatives of Lenin Carballido used a death certificate showing that he died of a diabetic coma in 2010 to convince police to drop an arrest warrant against him for allegedly participating in a 2004 gang rape. A living Carballido later ran in, and narrowly won, Sunday's election in San Agustin Amatengo in Oaxaca state. In his campaign, he posted photos of himself all around the village of 1,400 residents, with slogans like 'Now is the Time' and 'United for Development.' Lenin Carballido poses for a portrait during his campaign in Oaxaca, Mexico. Mexican prosecutors are investigating how Carballido was certified as dead, but was elected mayor of a village in southern Mexico . But shortly after his victory, the death certificate surfaced with his full name of Leninguer Carballido. Officials in Oaxaca said Thursday that the certificate had been drawn up and signed by a public registry official, but that the information had been faked. Carballido's party, the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, known as the PRD, said it had been fooled by the candidate. 'When he registered as a candidate, he presented all his paperwork, his birth certificate, a letter stating he had no criminal record,' said Rey Morales, the state leader of the PRD. 'He fooled the prosecutors' office, he fooled the office of records, he fooled electoral officials.' 'If all this is true, he cannot take office as mayor,' said Morales. Carballido didn't answer his cellphone Thursday. Lenin Carballido is pictured second from left at a campaign event in June . Haydee Reyes Soto, the director of the Oaxaca public records office, said the registry official who drew up the fake death certificate used a real official form, signed it and stamped it with an official seal, and even listed it under a file number used to record a real death. 'The form is real, what is false is the information,' Reyes Soto said, adding 'the decision has already been made to fire' the official, Abel de la Rosa Santos, who is also being questioned by prosecutors. According to records, a woman accused of Carballido and four other men of having raped her in Oaxaca city in 2004. Mayra Ricardez, spokeswoman for the Oaxaca state prosecutors' office, said the arrest warrant against Carballido was 'never served, because his family showed officers a false death certificate.' Ricardez said the statute of limitations had not run out on the crime. 'The prosecutors' office is taking all the legal steps necessary to revive the case and serve the arrest warrant that is still pending,' she said. It seems unlikely that Carballido will be able to take office in San Agustin Amatengo, an impoverished village near the city of Oaxaca where many residents left in the 2000s to seek work in the United States and elsewhere. One San Agustin Amatengo official, who said he could not speak on the record about a criminal case, said residents hadn't been aware of the candidate's past. 'All of this came out after the elections were over,' the official said. On Thursday, the Oaxaca state prosecutors' office issued a statement saying it would do everything it could to put him in jail, even if he is formally sworn in as mayor, and was considering whether he might also face charges on election-law violations. 'The state attorney general's office will investigate and bring charges, even if the suspect is recognized by electoral authorities as a municipal authority,' the office said, referring to him by his full name, Leninguer Raymundo Carballido Morales. He ran for office simply as 'Lenin Carballido.'","Lenin Carballido was elected mayor of San Agustin Amatengo in Oaxaca, Mexico on Sunday .

These are the first pictures of a female Russian aristocrat's bespoke dentures - made for her by Faberge from platinum and gold. The mystery noble woman's remains were found in a church near St Petersburg during an archeological dig ahead of planned renovations - but it was the contents of her glinting jaw that astonished experts. Her identity remains a puzzle and for now she is known only as Lady X. Luxury dental work: These are the first pictures of a female Russian aristocrat's bespoke dentures - made for her by Faberge from platinum and gold . She died aged between 50 and 60 in all probability in the opening years of the 20th century, before the Bolshevik Revolution engulfed her country, but scientists hope to be able to discover her real name with further research. Her expensive tastes are already clear from what has been dubbed 'history's most jaw-dropping jaw'. Professor Yury Molin, deputy head of the Bureau of Medical Forensic Examination for Leningrad region, said: 'We were about to finish our work when one member of our team assistant professor Alexander Gorshkov shouted: 'Yury, come here! Look what I've found!'' His excited voiced echoed through tumbledown Taitsy village church, badly damaged during fighting in the Second World War, and dedicated to Othodox saint Alexander Nevsky. Discovery: The mystery noble woman's remains were found in a church near St Petersburg during an archeological dig ahead of planned renovations - but it was the contents of her glinting jaw that astonished experts . Unknown: Her identity remains a puzzle and for now she is known only as Lady X . 'He was holding a skull. After . removing the mud, we immediately spotted a shiny denture in the upper . jaw, obviously not a simple one but made from precious metals. 'Spectral . and dental expertise proved it was a unique denture, produced around . the beginning of the 20th century from gold and platinum by the Karl . Faberge company.' Dental . experts from St Petersburg State Pavlov Medical University established . that 'this denture is a high quality product made by jewellery dental . prosthetic manufactory of the Karl Faberge Merchant House, which was . based in dental department of Obukhovskaya hospital' in St Petersburg, . then the capital of tsarist Russia. 'Multi-layer . china dentures were produced in Germany and supplied to Russia from the . middle of 19th century until the time of the First World War. 'The . mixture of metals in the denture - a high alloy of platinum with silver . and copper in the dental plate, and a high alloy of gold with platinum . and copper in the denture clasps, points to the fact that it was . produced at the end of 19th or beginning of 20th century'. This is because before 1891 a mixture of gold and iridium was used for clasps in Russia.' 'We . quickly realised the skull belongs to a noble woman,' said Professor . Molin, who was called in by local Orthodox priest Mikhail Vinogradov. Buried: Deformed lead sarcophagus which house Lady X's body inside . 'But we have not found anything about her in the archives yet. This is why we call her Lady X. 'Maybe . she was from the Beloselsky-Belozersky or Lopukhin families, or from . some other noble and well known family in this area. 'We . have very good hopes of identifying Lady X. I believe there could be . just a couple of dozen women at the time who could have afforded such a . denture. 'Unfortunately, . her skull was in a bad condition and almost fell into pieces in our . hands, so we have little chance to reconstruct her face and compare with . existing portraits which is often helpful. Still, we do not lose a hope . and will continue working to identify her from material in the . archives.' Other remains . dug up from the historic church have been identified as members of the . Demidov family - a rich noble family from the Urals who were much . earlier close to Peter the Great. Archive . evidence backed by DNA shows that the skeletons were those of  Petr . Demidov, his wife Elizaveta Bezobrazova and their 12-year-old son. Uncovered: The Orthodox church in Taitsy village in St Petersburg region where the denture was found . A surviving button on the boy's clothing shows he was a military cadet in the mid-19th century. The church records were lost perhaps during the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the area were later overrun by the Nazis. 'We found four graves, some of them were partly open and, unfortunately, destroyed,' said the professor. 'There were a lot of German bullets and helmets around. But we can't exclude the possibility  that the graves were touched before the second world war. 'There is also the fifth grave there but it is well protected with concrete cover and we have not examined it yet.' The priest hopes that the unusual find in the church will lead to discovery of the identity of Lady X and help to raise funds for a full-scale renovation of the historic building which was badly damaged by German shooting during the Second World War. 'I believe there could be just a couple of dozen women at the time who could have afforded such a denture' Professor Molin . Archeologists also found frescoes, old clothes and utensils. The church was associated with the Demidov family but it is not clear that Lady X was directly linked to this noble line. The 63 year old professor waited before announcing the denture discovery until the bodies had been reburied in keeping with a request from priest Vonogradov. 'This denture was found quite a while ago but the Orthodox priest allowed us to make it public only now, when the process of second burial of the identified bodies was over,' he said. 'The local church wanted to do it the proper way - they found Demidov family descendents in Finland, invited them, and held the second funeral in the church. 'The denture was found in early December 2011. We were invited to come for a full working day to work at the scene. 'It was at the end of this working day that we spotted this amazing denture. 'Let me stress, you must call it a unique discovery. In 40 years of my expert experience, I have never come across anything like this - a full size denture. 'Tooth crowns were found before, this is not a surprise, but a full size precious denture is purely a stroke of luck. 'We are proud to tell about our work now. There is no doubt this denture belongs to Karl Faberge company, we showed it to an elderly expert who studied Faberge dentures  - and a few matching dentures can be found in museums.' The dentures from the village church do not carry the Faberge imprint, possibly because the were chipped. But he is entirely confident they are the genuine article. 'Lady X is not identified yet but we are still hopeful. 'She is re-buried now too but in a sort of temporary grave, but her remains may be removed any moment so we can access the body again. '","Mystery noble woman's remains were found in a church near St Petersburg .

A collection of haunting photos offering an eye-opening perspective through the eyes of the aged who suffer from Alzheimer's disease shows their extraordinary lives like never before. A long-retired firefighter catches sight of himself in a living room mirror but instead of seeing greyed hair and softer skin, the striking reflection of a strapping young man stares back. The image may be nothing new to the older man, but the sight isn't one his wife seen seated behind him appears to see as well. Former lives: A retired fire fighter, who's actual photo is seen tucked in the mirror's top left corner, gazes into his reflection that shows a strapping young fire fighter staring straight back . Youth's elixir: Another man, seen stirring a cup of coffee, catches sight of himself in his days working in a lab, stirring the contents in a beaker . How we were: An elderly woman clutches a comb for her white hair while the dark-haired reflection of a young school teacher, a notebook and red apple in her arms, reflects back in her mirror . These are the photos taken by Dallas, Texas photographer Tom Hussey using sets of real people aged 40 to 50 years apart. 'We cast two people for each part — an older “Patient” and then another actor to look like the patient 40 years earlier in their lifetime,' Mr Hussey told the American Society of Media Photographers. Yet the underlying message is much more painful as a reflection of a mentally debilitating disease five million men and women in the United States currently suffer from. The photographs ran as an ad for an Alzheimer’s pharmaceutical patch - seen on many of the model's arms - aiming to help those suffering from dementia, a disease that gradually strips its victims of its more recent memories. Disease: The ads were taken for an Alzheimer¿s drug, a disease that gradually strips its victims of their newer memories, for some eventually leaving them with only those of their youth . Familiar faces: Approximately five million Americans suffer from the disease, that leaves many of its victims only remembering their past lives . Models: The collection was taken with the help of several sets of models that resembled one another despite being 40 to 50 years apart in age . For some people, they eventually only remember the memories of their youth. Symptoms of dementia include loss of memory, mood changes, and problems with communication and reasoning. The progressive nature of dementia, such as Alzheimer's Disease, means that the symptoms will gradually get worse. At the moment the Alzheimer's Society estimates that there are 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. It was a WWII vet who inspired Mr Hussey's collection that later won him a gold Addy and ran in the 2010 Communication Arts Photography Annual. 'He commented that he didn’t understand how he could be 80-years-old as he felt he was still a young man. He just didn’t feel it was possible he could be 80-years-old,' Mr Hussey told the ASMP of the war veteran. He later built a bathroom set and photographed the man gazing at himself in the mirror, as a 25-year-old version of himself smiled back. Inspiration: The collection's idea came to Dallas photographer Tom Hussey after a conversation with an 80-year-old WWII veteran who expressed disbelief in his old age . Reflections: The profession the men and women were seen as being, a seamstress pictured, were chosen by their casting and location aspects of the ads . Rediscovered: A man uncovers his old welding mask and after turning to look in a nearby mirror sees himself with the mask strapped to his head as a younger man . ‘We worked through the casting and location aspects of the ads helping to determine what profession the patient had been in their youth so we could portray that in the reflected image,’ he said of the photos’ creation. ‘This profession drove what room setting and propping needed to be created to complete the image.’ In result, a seamstress sees herself seated before a sewing machine. In another photo a welder holds his old mask while turning to see himself in his much younger years, the mask clipped securely around his head. In some of the staged photos actual pictures of the models are seen tucked into the setting, showing them how they used to look, Mr Hussey said. ‘The images are all about history — remembering yourself in historical context. I think the history and memory aspects are very important to me and my interest in this helped make the campaign a success,’ Mr Hussey said.","Photographer Tom Hussey used sets of two people aged 50 years apart .

Two men with HIV have been able to stop taking their medication after receiving bone marrow transplants. Experts say it is too early to describe them as ‘cured’ – but the Aids virus shows no signs of returning in either patient. The men, who had HIV for about 30 years, received transplants to treat blood cancer several years ago. One stopped taking anti-HIV drugs four months ago, while the other stopped seven weeks ago. Both men had suffered with blood cancer and had undergone bone marrow transplants (marrow being prepared pictured) to treat that disease. No one expected the procedure to have such a dramatic and beneficial side effect . Their US doctors say keeping them on . the drugs after their transplants first took place prevented their new . supplies of healthy blood cells from becoming infected by HIV. The . patients’ old, diseased cells were then attacked by the new ones. The International Aids Society . conference in Malaysia heard that now, even though the patients have . stopped taking antiretroviral drugs, the virus cannot be detected in . their blood. Normally, the disease can only be kept under control with . lifelong treatment. Working out why the bone marrow . transplants had such a strong effect could lead to new treatments for . the 34million living with Aids. An estimated 100,000 Britons have HIV, . including 20,000 who have not been formally diagnosed. Timothy Henrich, of the Brigham and . Women’s Hospital in Boston, said the men ‘are doing very well’, but . warned: ‘While these results are exciting, they do not yet indicate the . men have been cured. Only time will tell.’ Experts say it is too early to say that the men are cured as virus (pictured) could be hiding in organs . One possibility is that the virus is . ‘hiding’ in another part of the body, such as the liver or brain, and . could re-emerge in the coming weeks. Dr Michael Brady of the Terrence . Higgins Trust stressed that bone marrow transplants are ‘complex and . expensive’, and could be more dangerous than daily medication. However, he added: ‘While this is by . no means a workable cure, it does give researchers another sign-post in . the direction of one.’ The first person reported to be cured of HIV, American Timothy Ray Brown, underwent a stem cell transplant in 2007 to treat his leukemia. He was reported by his German doctors to have been cured of HIV two years later. Brown's doctors used a donor who had a rare genetic mutation that provides resistance against HIV. So far, no one has observed similar results using ordinary donor cells such as those given to the two Boston patients. Kuritzkes said the patients will be put back on the drugs if there is a viral rebound. A rebound will show that other sites are important reservoirs of infectious virus and new approaches to measuring these reservoirs will be needed in developing a cure, Henrich said. ‘These findings clearly provide important new information that might well alter the current thinking about HIV and gene therapy,’ Kevin Robert Frost, chief executive of The Foundation of AIDS Research, said in a statement. 'While stem cell transplantation is not a viable option for people with HIV on a broad scale because of its costs and complexity, these new cases could lead us to new approaches to treating, and ultimately even eradicating, HIV.'","Last year scientists announced that the two unnamed men no longer seemed to have the virus but they were still taking antiretroviral medication .

The treatment of killer whales who perform for tourists at theme parks has been questioned by a new research that shows they are left traumatised by years of captivity. Far from being content to perform the whales are kept in conditions that make them aggressive. Researchers say the stress of being confined to a small pool, rather than allowed to roam the ocean, causes the killer whales to take out their frustration on their trainers. In 2010 the dangers were tragically highlighted when an Orca killed its trainer Dawn Brancheau in front of horrified tourists at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. Horrifying: Killer whale Tilikum killed trainer 40-year-old trainer Dawn Brancheau at Sea World, Florida . It later emerged that the 12,000lb whale called Tilikum had previously killed another trainer and drowned a man who broke into his enclosure. The gruesome death of Brancheau in 2010 led to an overhaul of the lucrative business of using killer whales for the entertainment of tourists in the US. Trainers are no longer allowed in the water with the killer whales - but the pds1bn a year business is still thriving. Tens of thousands of British tourists visit Sea World every year during trips to the Florida theme parks. The dangers of keeping killer whales in captivity is demonstrated in a documentary film called Blackfish, which was screened at the Sheffield documentary film festival. Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite said the killer whales should not be kept for the entertainment of tourists. Killed: Trainer Dawn Brancheau and Tilikum before the incident in which the killer whale pulls her into the water and attacked her . 'These are huge and highly intelligent animals. They should not be in captivity,' she said. During the making of her film she said she came across dozens of ‘near misses’ where trainers have been threatened or injured by killer whales. 'I spent two years tracking down all these incidents. There have been four deaths and many near misses and injuries, I suspect possibly hundreds - no-one likes to report them,' she said. Apart from the well publicised death of Brancheau, who was dragged underwater by her ponytail by Tilikum, the killer whale had previously killed another trainer. In 1991 Tilikum killed Keltie Byrne in a Canadian park and eight years later in 1999 drowned a man who had stayed behind at SeaWorld after he jumped into the pool. Similar incidents have happened in Europe with a trainer rammed and killed by Keto, a killer whale at Loro Parque in Tenerife, one of two marine parks in Europe to hold the creatures. Popular: Many marine parks, such as Sea World in Orlando, Florida draw many visitors for their killer whale performances . The other is Marineland in Antibes, France, where dangerous incidents, but no deaths, have been recorded. Since the 1960s killer whales have been used for entertainment at theme parks, including Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire where an orca called Cuddles was the star attraction. Research by Cowperthwaite and Whale and Dolphin Conservation has revealed that Cuddles became so aggressive that his keepers had to clean the pool from the protection of a shark cage. Britain has since banned zoos from keeping whales and dolphins, but around the world there are still 44 in captivity. Author David Kirby said the aggressive behaviour of Tilikum was not unusual among captive killer whales. 'Tilikum is a very disturbed and dangerous animal but I know of at least 20 other captive animals showing similar behaviour,' said Kirby who has written a book Death at SeaWorld, chronicling the death of 40 year old Brancheau. 'They bite people, ram them, leap out of the water on top of them and pull them into the water from the side. These are aggressive powerful animals. They should not be in captivity and humans should not be working closely with them.'","Danger highlighted when a whale called Tilikum killed trainer at SeaWorld .

Public health officials in Illinois said on Wednesday that one resident became sick after eating contaminated cheese in May, according to the Huffington Post. The FDA said the Minnesota Department of Agriculture is testing samples of the cheese and early results indicate that there is listeria bacteria present in the samples. Confirmation of these results is pending. If ingested, the listeria bacteria can cause listeriosis, a rare and serious illness. The cheese was sold in 30 states under names including Les Freres and Crave Brothers Les Freres. On the company's website, the cheese is described as: 'This European style cheese was developed with care to reflect the Crave Brothers' Irish-French heritage. 'It is a rich rind washed cheese with an earthy, fruity flavour. It tastes wonderful served with fruits and breads, paired with wine or in a cheese course.' The cheese was cut and packaged in clear plastic wrap and sold with Whole Foods Market scale labels. Bacteria: If ingested, listeria can cause listeriosis, a rare and serious illness . Whole Foods has now started posting signs in its stores to inform customers about the recall and said customers should throw away the cheese and bring in their receipts for a full refund. Crave Brothers, which is based in Waterloo, Wisconsin, has announced a voluntary recall of Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles cheese made on July 1 or earlier. It said the cheeses were distributed around the country through retail and food service outlets and mail order. The president of Crave Brothers, George Crave, issued a statement on its website, saying: 'We are cooperating with the regulatory agencies' ongoing investigation of the cause of the potential health risks'. The website urges its customers who have purchased any of the products 'not to consume them'. In 2011 a listeria outbreak related to tainted cantaloupes sickened 147 and killed 33 people, according to the ABC.","The Crave Brothers Les Freres cheese may be contaminated with Listeria which can kill children and elderly .

A five-pound chihuahua showed up at a California animal shelter limping and was given an X-ray. To the shock of veterinarians, the scan showed nine sewing needles lodged in his abdomen. Yoda, a stray, underwent emergency surgery at Orange County Animal Care after vets discovered the needles. Even more astonishing was Yoda's miraculous return to life after the removal of one pin piercing his heart stopped his heartbeat during surgery for 15 minutes. Shocking: A stray chihuahua in California was found to have nine sewing needles lodged in his internal organs . Heart-stopping: Dr Diane Craig performed the surgery on Yoda and managed to save the little dog . ‘[The needles] had just left the . stomach and were going through the liver, through the diaphragm and were . headed into his chest,’ Dr Diane Craig, who operated on the dog, told . CBSLA. Craig said in 30 . years of veterinary surgery, she's never seen anything like Yoda's case. The needles were poking holes in the dog's lungs, and she knew that if . she didn't operate swiftly, Yoda would die. The vet said she has no idea how the needles ended up inside Yoda, but she suspects it wasn’t an accident. 'It’s hard to imagine a dog would voluntarily eat nine sewing needles,' she told CBSLA. The force is with him: Yoda's heart stopped for 15 minutes before he came back to life when the vet used a defibrillator . In surgery, Craig required the assistance of another veterinary surgeon and a support staff of five to try to save the little dog. 'We had this dog's chest and abdomen open at the same time,' she she said of the unprecedented surgery. All sewn up: Yoda's chest and abdomen were cut open to allow vets to remove all the pins from his system . Lifesaver: Dr Diane Craig has 30 years veterinary surgery experience, but even she was taken aback by Yoda's X-rays . At one point, she used a magnet to remove a pin piercing Yoda's heart, after which it stopped beating. Craig worked for fifteen minutes massaging the tiny heart to no avail. In an unusual move, the vet chose to defibrillate the tiny dog. Remarkably, Yoda came back to life. Little miracle: Yoda is now looking for a permanent home . 'That, for us, kinda makes him a miracle,' said a shelter staff member. Yoda is expected to fully recover as he waits at a foster home to be adopted.

George Osborne’s personal finances came under fierce scrutiny yesterday after he insisted he was not wealthy enough to pay the 50p tax rate. Sources close to the Prime Minister admitted that David Cameron does earn more than the £150,000 threshold for top-rate tax – and will benefit from the announcement that it will be cut to 45p. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who earns a Cabinet salary of £134,565, insisted he would not benefit from his own policy. George Osborne and his wife Frances. He earns a Cabinet salary of £134,565 and insisted he would not benefit from his own policy. Mr Osborne and his wife receive a six-figure annual income from letting their £3m home . During a BBC radio interview, Mr Osborne was adamant: ‘My salary is less than the £150,000 threshold... so I am not personally affected.’ Quizzed about other income which might take him over the threshold, he replied: ‘I am not a big winner from this budget.’ Asked again if he was a 50p tax rate payer, the Chancellor – one of the wealthiest Cabinet members – added: ‘I’m not actually, no.’ But his claim appeared to be unravelling last night as it emerged that while Mr Osborne may not be paying the full rate this financial year, he probably will have to pay the 50p rate in his next tax return. The Chancellor would need extra income of just £15,435 to reach the £150,000 threshold – and eventually benefit from his controversial decision to cut the top rate. Sources close to the Prime Minister admitted that David Cameron does earn more than the £150,000 threshold for top-rate tax and will benefit from the announcement that it will be cut to 45p . During a series of interviews, Mr Osborne failed to mention an additional six-figure annual income he and wife Frances receive from letting their £3million home in Notting Hill, one of the wealthiest parts of London. Mr Osborne’s tax return for 2010-11 would not have included the lucrative rental income that began flowing into the Osborne bank account months later. Family fortune: The Chancellor's father 17th Baronet Sir Peter Osborne (standing) and Anthony Little, the co-founders of Osborne & Little design . Nor did he talk about his shareholding in the family’s upmarket fabrics and wallpaper firm Osborne & Little, reputed to be worth more than £4million. Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle said: ‘We were all astonished to learn from the Chancellor this morning that he was not a top-rate taxpayer. ‘The hunt is now on for the name of his accountant, who will surely find himself in spectacular demand.’ Mr Osborne, who told MPs during his Budget speech that he regarded ‘tax evasion and, indeed, aggressive tax avoidance, as morally repugnant’, refused to discuss his personal finances in detail last night. An aide insisted he was not a tax dodger but made clear his denial that he pays 50p tax only covers his last tax return – a legalistic distinction unlikely to be appreciated by voters struggling to make ends meet. An aide to the Chancellor told the . Mail: ‘In the most recent tax year, George Osborne was a higher rate . taxpayer [the 40p rate]. ‘He . has his salary and part of the rental income from one property that has . a mortgage on it. He makes no use of tax avoidance schemes.’  Asked if . the Chancellor would pay the 50p rate in his 2011/12 tax return, one . source said: ‘You can’t say that for certain. He goes through the normal . process of self-assessment and those things are worked out later.’ But . the source repeatedly declined the opportunity to deny that Mr Osborne . was likely to have earned enough over the past year to put him in the . top tier of taxpayers. According to the MPs’ register of interests, Mr Osborne declares two additional sources of income apart from his ministerial salary – rental from a ‘residential property in London,’ and ‘registrable shareholdings’ in Osborne & Little. The Chancellor only registered the rental income from July last year, when he moved his family from their elegant five-storey Notting Hill home into the flat above 10 Downing Street. Similar houses in the trendy West London area can command rentals of upwards of £4,000 a week – giving Mr Osborne and his novelist wife a potential extra income of well over £200,000 a year. However, Land Registry documents show the house is jointly owned by Mr and Mrs Osborne and there are two mortgages – one with Barclays and another with a private bank – registered against the property. Wealthy: George Osborne with his wife Frances, the elder daughter of Conservative Cabinet Minister Lord Howell of Guildford, who he married in 1998 . It is not known how much the Osbornes have to pay in monthly mortgage repayments, but they could legitimately cut the size of their tax bill by off-setting both mortgage interest payments and any maintenance costs. This would have the effect of cutting the ‘profit’ they made each month on the house. Mr Osborne is also a beneficiary of a trust fund which owns 15 per cent of the Osborne & Little family business founded by his father, the baronet Sir Peter Osborne. According to accounts filed at Companies House the firm, which has a turnover of £23million, has suffered losses for the past three years and no dividend was paid to shareholders in the last financial year – but £1,476,720 was paid out in 2010. Aides suggested the Chancellor did not draw an income from his shareholding in the last tax year.","George Osborne earns £134,565 as Chancellor - just over £15,000 short of 50p tax threshold .

A cruel dog owner has been jailed after beating his pet Staffordshire bull terrier so badly that it lost and eye and was left permanently disabled. Sadistic Jack Carling, 19, 'tortured' dog Biggie at his home in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, never letting him or his other pet dog Sophie out for exercise. Carling was jailed for three months at Hull Crown Court and banned from keeping animals for life. Cruel: Jobless Jack Carling, left, has been jailed for three months and banned from keeping animals after abusing his pet Staffordshire bull terrier Biggie (right) and his other dog Sophie . Abused: Biggie lost an eye because of the injuries Carling inflicted and was found to have a number of healed fractures . Vets concluded all of Biggie's injuries were caused by 'malicious trauma.' District Judge Frederick Rutherford said: 'this dog has been subjected to such torture almost beggars belief.' Witness Troy Allen, who lived with Carling said Biggie and his other dog Sophie lived in fear of their owner. Prosecutor Philip Brown said: 'Troy said Jack would get angry with the dogs, he witnessed him beating the dogs. He said they would get into the smallest of spaces to hide from [Carling]. 'He said he would beat them every day. He didn't let them out, they would just stay on the sofa, scared.' Care: As well as being abused, Biggie and Carling's other dog, Sophie (right) were also found to have been kept in completely unsuitable conditions . Biggie and Sophie were seized by the RSPCA on January 7. Mr Brown said: 'Vets said there was evidence of a self-healed fracture to [Biggie's] leg and a fracture to the hip. There was also an injury to an eye, which required it to be removed. 'He was also suffering a nasal discharge, which was treated with antibiotics but kept returning. It was causing such concern that vets decided to carry out an invasive, intensive operation to open up the nasal cavity.' During the operation, vets noticed part of Biggie's skull was ten times thicker than it should be. There was also damage to cartilage and tissue, which vets concluded was also the result of trauma. Future: Biggie has made a good recovery following his horrifying ordeal. He and Sophie are now due to be rehomed . Mr Brown said: 'He was caused immense physical suffering by the repeated malicious trauma inflicted on him. He has experienced daily fear, wondering what would happen to him next. He is disabled for life. 'The vet says it is upsetting to think this lovely-natured dog could be subjected to this degree of treatment.' The court heard the dogs were also kept in 'wholly unsuitable' living conditions, with the floor covered in urine and excrement. When RSPCA inspector Hannah Bryer began investigating the case, Carling told her he 'didn't care' what she said and that she could not do anything about it. Carling pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering, failing to prevent suffering from injury or disease and failing to provide a suitable living environment for the dogs. He has several previous convictions for violence. In mitigation, Michael Robinson said: 'I have known Jack for many years and I am surprised at the extent of the suffering he accepts causing this animal.' Carling had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, he said. Judge Rutherford said: 'It is rare that I have seen a dog subjected to such acts over such a long period to of time to survive. The dog has been left disabled as a direct consequence. 'You have shown complete arrogance in the manner you have behaved towards the animal and those investigating this case.' The RSPCA will now try to rehome Biggie and Sophie.","Jack Carling 'tortured' his dog Biggie at his home in Hull, North Yorkshire .

The people behind the anti-cyborg movement say there is no way someone can ever know for sure that another person wearing Google Glass is not recording their every word and movement. ‘Gradually people will stop acting as autonomous individuals when making decisions and interacting with others, and instead become mere sensor/effector nodes of a global network,’ the site states. The protestor group additionally runs a 'Stop The Cyborgs' store on its site, where online visitors can buy T-shirts and stickers that say ‘Google Glass is banned on these premises,’ and show images of Google Glass being crossed out.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'He was taken ill in the early hours of Monday and admitted to hospital for assessment.' He added that medical staff 'diagnosed him as having had a mild stroke'. It is understood that the Queen, who herself has been ill recently with the symptoms of gastroenteritis, has been informed.

A stroke is when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off - either by a blood clot or bleeding - and brain cells are damaged or die. But the Duke could have suffered a transient ischaemic attack, also known as a mini stroke, where there is only a momentary lack of blood flow to the brain. If he has experienced the lesser illness, the royal could be back attending official engagements within a few weeks. His next royal event is on April 16 when he is scheduled to visit West Sussex to tour a number of places including a school and a museum. It is thought the Duke, whose first name is Edward, is still being treated at a London hospital. Born . in 1935, the Duke of Kent is the son of the late Prince George, the fourth . son of King George V and the late Princess Marina, daughter of Prince . Nicholas of Greece. The Queen fell ill with a crippling bout of gastroenteritis almost three weeks ago, and was forced to cancel all of her engagements, including a planned visit to Rome. It is the first time in almost a decade that she has been ill enough to spend time in hospital. The Duke is president of the Stroke Association and its chief executive Jon Barrick wished him well: 'We are deeply saddened to hear about His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent's stroke. 'Our thoughts are with him and his family and we wish him a very speedy recovery. 'The Duke of Kent has been president of the Stroke Association since our inception over 20 years ago and he has shown tremendous support and dedication to our cause.

Even for a couple whose relationship is said to be volatile, the pictures are shocking. Sat at their favourite Mayfair restaurant, Charles Saatchi repeatedly grabs his wife Nigella Lawson by the neck. At one point, the TV cook seems to plead with her 70-year-old husband as he holds her throat and her eyes widen. Later it was claimed she left the restaurant in tears. Alarming: Shocking pictures have emerged of Nigella Lawson, right,  apparently being choked by her husband millionaire Charles Saatchi, left, during a row in a restaurant. Yesterday morning the couple both remained tight-lipped as they left their multi-million pound London home, pictured, separately . Anxious: Nigella Lawson looked stressed as she climbed into a waiting taxi with her teenage son Bruno. The photos appear to show the couple embroiled in a major dispute as they sit outside Scott's in Mayfair . Yesterday, the pair declined to . comment after they left their converted brewery home separately by . taxis. However, police revealed that they were likely to question them . about the incident. The Metropolitan Police said that . although no official complaint had been made by Miss Lawson, officers . were ‘aware’ of the pictures and ‘inquiries are in hand to establish the . facts of the incident’. This means Mr Saatchi is almost . certain to be questioned by detectives within weeks about exactly what . took place in the restaurant. The apparent assault is said to have . put huge strain on their ten-year marriage, his third and her second. A . witness was quoted in a Sunday newspaper as saying: ‘It was utterly . shocking to watch. Charles Saatchi arriving at his Chelsea Flat yesterday morning. He re-emerged a short time later, leaving their mansion off the King's Road in Chelsea, west London, shortly after 10am . Leaving home: On four occasions, Mr Saatchi, 70, appears to reach over and grab TV chef Nigella around the throat . ‘I have no doubt she was scared. It . was horrific, really. She was very tearful and was constantly dabbing . her eyes. Nigella was very, very upset. ‘She had a real look of fear on her . face. And yet she kissed him. She appeared to be a woman who loves him . but was clearly unable to stop him being abusive, frightening and . disrespectful to her.’ Neighbours of the couple also spoke of . their ‘volatile’ relationship. One said they had previously heard the . pair having a bitter argument loudly in the street. But the neighbours dismissed talks of a split saying they had been spotted walking happily hand-in-hand during the weekend. One said: ‘They’re both characters and . if they did this I’m sure they made up straight away as I’ve seen them . together looking happily recently. Shock: The couple, pictured above during a visit to Scott's in April this year, where the alleged attack took place . Fiery: In the past Miss Lawson has admitted she and Saatchi have their fiery moments. 'I'll go quiet when he explodes, and then I am a nest of horrible festeringness.' Dining out: The couple frequently dine out in the capital as seen in a photo taken earlier this year. The famous couple always choose an outside table at Scott's so the art collector can smoke copious cigarettes . Disturbing: The pictures, published in the Sunday People, appear to show Mr Saatchi grabbing Nigella by the throat . ‘They argue in the streets and are . volatile at times but that could just be their form of passion. Those . pictures do look unpleasant though.’ The couple, who are thought to be . worth £128million, had just finished eating outdoors at their favourite . seafood restaurant Scott’s last Sunday when Mr Saatchi is reported to . have started a heated and angry exchange with his wife. Miss Lawson, 53, looked tearful as he . grabbed her neck four times, first with his left hand and then both. As . he held her neck, they clutched hands across the table before Mr Saatchi . tweaked her nose and used both wrists to push her face. Afterwards, Miss Lawson dabbed her tearful eyes in a napkin as he tapped his cigarettes impatiently upon the table. She then gulped a whole glass of wine . before appearing to attempt to pacify him with a trembling voice. During . the attempted reconciliation, she leaned over the table and kissed his . right cheek. Mr Saatchi, who helped mastermind . former prime minister Margaret Thatcher’s election campaigns, then . marched off from the table before his wife followed while wiping away . her tears. It is not the first time the couple . have been seen arguing publicly, but the first that has apparently . involved him manhandling her. Miss Lawson has recently spent a lot of time travelling across the US promoting her new book and successful television series. The couple live in a £12million former . 18th century brewery and gas engineer works that they have spent . hundreds of thousands of pounds converting since they bought the . seven-bedroom home in 2010. Fame: Miss Lawson studied at Oxford University and is estimated to have earned £15million from her cookery career . Fame: Famous for her flirty cooking shows, the mother-of-two rose to fame in 1999 when she began hosting Nigella Bites on Channel 4. Tension: The television chef has previously been seen arguing with her husband in London . Tension: Miss Lawson looked angry as she spoke to Mr Saatchi at their home in Eaton Square a few years ago . First . marriage: Miss Lawson married Mr Saatchi after her first husband . journalist John Diamond died in 2001 aged 41, from throat cancer - she had her two children with him, Cosima, now 19, and Bruno, 17 . Nigella says that she has a happy family life after finding love again with Charles Saatchi . Second marriage: Before marrying the famous chef Charles Saatchi was married to Kay Saatchi. Kay was granted a divorce on the grounds of his unreasonable behaviour . Miss Lawson has two children, Cosima, . 19, and Bruno, 17, with her husband John Diamond, who she met while they . worked at The Sunday Times. She moved in with Mr Saatchi, who was a . friend of her first husband, nine months after he died of throat cancer . aged 41 and shortly after her debut cooking television show Nigella . Bites aired. Bruno yesterday helped his mother into a black taxi before Mr Saatchi left in another cab shortly afterwards. Both refused to answer questions about . the incident but they were photographed together at the same restaurant . on Saturday. In a recent interview, Miss Lawson revealed that she was . physically abused by her mother when she was a child. A violent and depressive woman, . Vanessa Salmon – who married former Conservative Chancellor Nigel . Lawson, would lash out at her and her brother, former Sunday Telegraph . editor Dominic, when they made too much noise, she claimed. A spokesman for Miss Lawson also declined to comment. Domestic violence is a top priority . crime in the capital, and senior officers will want to investigate even . without a complaint from the victim. A Met Police spokesman said: ‘Officers are aware. Inquiries are in hand to establish the facts of the incident.’ A Scott’s spokesman said: ‘The staff . at Scott’s are aware of the allegations in the media today but did not . see anything untoward happen within the restaurant.

Wizards can also . apparate to the site, or use the Floo Network, which involves travelling . from one place to another through fireplaces. You can now explore the set of Diagon Alley - the famous street from the Harry Potter films - that features Ollivander's Wand shop, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and Gringotts Bank - on Google Street View. The set is the first part of the Warner Bros studios tour in Leavesden to be made available online . Mr Mulpepper's Apothecary, pictured, is a shop in Diagon Alley that sells potion ingredients in the Harry Potter films. In the books it sells Potion Kit Bags for 10 sickles and Cleaning Solutions & Restorative Draughts. It has a chain of stores with another shop appearing in Knockturn Alley later in the series . The set contains Gringotts Bank which is run by goblins, an ice-cream parlour, pet shops, book shops, Ollivander's Wand shop, magical clothing shops, Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes joke shop, broom shops, Mr Mulpepper's Apothecary, and more. The DVD of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets includes a video 'guided tour' of Diagon Alley but the Google Street view images are the first time the set has been photographed and put online. Reports suggest that the set of Diagon Alley took more than three months to make. Warner Bros studio then spent six months making the 20,000 items and props used in the windows and in the sets of the shops. Warner Bros open the studio tour in Leavesden, just outside London, in March 2012. Ollivander's is a wand shop that opened in 382 BC, according to the books. The Google Street View images show a wand lying on a faded purple cushion in the window. The story goes that Harry Potter was taken to Ollivander's in 1991 to buy a wand for his first year at Hogwarts. Harry tried dozens of wands before he was chosen by a wand of Holly and Phoenix Feather - a 'brother' to the wand that had killed his parents . You can peer through the door at Weasleys' Wizards Wheezes from the Harry Potter film set on Street View. In the books it is joke shop run by Fred and George Weasley. It opened its doors at number 93 Diagon Alley in the book Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince . The Wiseacre's Wizarding Equipment shop's name, pictured, is not revealed in the books. The shop was first referred to as such in the 'Tour Diagon Alley' feature included on Disc 2 of the DVD release of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and was then confirmed on the Pottermore site . Flourish & Blotts, pictured, sells magic books. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, celebrity author Gilderoy Lockhart signs copies of his autobiography at the shop the day Harry visits . A tour costs £29 for adults and £21.50 for children. Each tour session typically lasts . around three hours and other sets include the Great Hall, Dumbledore's . Office, the Ministry of Magic, Gryffindor Common Room and Boys' Dormitory, Hagrid's Hut and a 1:24 scale model of Hogwarts Castle. During the tour there is also a pit . stop at Privet Drive with the chance to have your photo taken outside the . Dursley’s home, and the opportunity to drink a a jug of Butterbeer at . the Leaky Cauldron pub. There is also a lesson in casting spells. Although the tour currently only focuses on Harry Potter, Warner Bros. have highlighted the possibility to expand the tour to other Warner Bros. franchises in the years to come. The Diagon Alley Street View images are part of Google's wider Business Photos project where companies let the search engine take 360-degree photographs of their offices. Google has previously photographed Battleship Island, that featured in the James Bond film Skyfall as well as NFL’s Indianapolis Colts' Lucas Oil Stadium. The Street View trekkers recently visited the Galapagos Islands - which is closed off from tourists - to capture photos of the areas famous giant tortoises and other unsual creatures. Google, in partnership with Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) and the Galapagos National Parks Directorate (GNPD), sent hikers to the Islands to take panoramic images of its wildlife. The hikers captured thousands of images using the football-like cameras mounted on a tower on top of the 42lb (19kg) computer backpacks. Earlier this week Google announced it would be letting people borrow the Street View Trekker cameras but people had to apply for the scheme. Gringotts Wizarding Bank, pictured, is at the end of Diagon Alley at the intersection with Knockturn Alley. In the books Gringotts is run by goblins . This image shows the entrance to The Daily Prophet's main offices. In the books, the editor of The Daily Prophet paper is Barnabas Cuffe. The paper is delivered to subscribers by owl and subscriptions cost 1 Knut. There is also a weekend edition mentioned in the films called the Sunday Prophet .","Diagon Alley is a row of shops that features in the Harry Potter films .

I don’t bite!’ The single mother-of-three said . customers regularly leave after seeing her. When one family turned . around to go she heard them say: ‘I think we’re in the wrong place.’ Miss Kolleh said she tested her theory by employing a white member of staff to serve customers while she waited out the back. ‘She did very well and we had a lot of custom, but as soon as I was back behind the counter, nobody comes in,’ she said.

The first buyers of Google's Glass wearable computer have been banned from selling or even lending the gadget to friends - even though they have paid almost £1,000 for it. It will not go on sale to the public until next year. Several of the Glasses are also believed to have been put up for sale on eBay, but auctions were pulled down before they could be completed . 'If you resell, loan, transfer, or give . your device to any other person without Google's authorization, Google . reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the . unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, . product support, or product warranty,' the firm told buyers. Glass must be connected to the internet via a wifi or bluetooth connection to work, allowing Google to keep tabs on which account it uses. Once Glass is available to the general public — not just for the elite Glass Explorers — the sales terms will become more lenient, with buyers allowed to give them away: 'You may not commercially resell any device, but you may give the device as a gift,' Google writes. Several of the Glasses are also believed to have been put up for sale on eBay, but auctions were pulled down before they could be completed. Earlier this month the glasses were released to the first group of developers outside the company, known as 'Explorers', and the excited testers rushed to upload footage to YouTube that they captured wearing the devices .

A day in the life: Matt Abdou posted a clip that shows him recording his Go Kart adventure in Burlingame, CA, as seen through his Google Glasses . To use the first version of the glasses, users found they also need a mobile phone running Google's Android software - ruling out iPhone owners. Google has created a special app, called MyGlass, which owners use to set up their device, and to use its key features - GPS and sending and receiving messages. 'The MyGlass companion app requires Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or higher. 'MyGlass enables GPS and SMS messaging,' Google says online. It is unclear where an iPhone version will ever be made available. The camera on the wearable computer . shoots in 720p so the clips are impressively clear and the videos are . whetting the appetite of early adopters eagerly awaiting the release of . the device. Google finally released the wearable 'Glass' computer it hopes could form the next massive shift in technology. Google Glass was delivered to the first customers outside the company today, after they signed up last year to be the first to buy the ($1500) 'Explorer edition' of the gadget. The firm says the high resolution display is the equivalent of a 25 inch high definition TV viewed from eight feet away - but warns that users will have to recharge their glasses every day.

'Some features, like Hangouts and video recording, are more battery intensive,' it said. Google also released the APIs programmers will need to create their own Glass apps. The search giant is also set to open stores to show off Glass, according to 9to5mac. 'An extremely reliable source has confirmed to us that Google is in the process of building stand-alone retail stores in the U.S. and hopes to have the first flagship Google Stores open for the holidays in major metropolitan areas,' it said.

Apple have also released the app lucky owners will use to set up the electronic eyewear . Glass is expected to go on sale to consumers later this year, costing around £800 . The people behind the anti-cyborg movement say there is no way someone can ever know for sure that another person wearing Google Glass is not recording their every word and movement. ‘Gradually people will stop acting as autonomous individuals when making decisions and interacting with others, and instead become mere sensor/effector nodes of a global network,’ the site states. The protestor group additionally runs a 'Stop The Cyborgs' store on its site, where online visitors can buy T-shirts and stickers that say ‘Google Glass is banned on these premises,’ and show images of Google Glass being crossed out. However, on the site the group admits: 'Please note that Google has not yet officially released the details of how Google Glass will work', adding that their privacy concerns are 'educated speculation based on public press articles'.

An obituary announcement submitted by . the family in the Burmese language Myanma Ahlin daily today said his . funeral would be held on July 17. Lo Hsing Han's involvement in the drug trade began more than four decades ago. In exchange for heading a local militia set up by then-dictator Ne Win in the 1960s to help fight local communists in the region of Kokang, Lo Hsing Han was given permission to engage in the trafficking of opium and heroin, said Bertil Lintner, author of The Golden Triangle Opium Trade: An Overview.

Ice cream company Ben & Jerry's is to stop using genetically modified ingredients in its products. The Vermont-based brand has promised to eradicate GM organisms from the recipes for its U.S. and Canadian products by 2014. Only 80 per cent of the current ingredients are non-GMO, said a statement on the company's website. It also promised to source as many of the new ingredients from Fairtrade suppliers as possible. All Ben & Jerry's products sold in the European Union are already GMO-free, it said. 'Our goal is for all of our flavors to be Fairtrade certified and sourced with non-GMO ingredients by the end of the year,' the company said. 'That’s about 80 flavors, 110 ingredients and more than 200 different products to transition this year. 'There can be almost 40 different ingredients in a single flavor, so you can see how complex this undertaking is.' Ben & Jerry's said it supports legislation to make labeling of food made with GMO ingredients compulsory. A year ago, its parent company Unilever gave half a million dollars in support of the campaign against Proposition 37, a Californian measure to introduce GMO labelling, reports the Huffington Post. Unilever joined forces with the likes of Monsanto, Kraft, The Hershey Company and PepsiCo, spending $44million defeating the proposition between them. Last week the European Union urged its members to test wheat shipments from the United States after unauthorised genetically modified grains were found in Japan. Tokyo halted imports of certain types of wheat from the U.S. on Thursday following the discovery of an experimental strain that was tested by Monsanto but never approved. The EU's consumer protection office said on Friday that shipments which test positive should not be sold in line with the bloc's 'zero tolerance' for GM crops. It also said it was seeking 'further information and reassurance' from U.S. authorities and had asked Monsanto for help in developing a reliable test for the GM grains. US officials are investigating which could jeopardise the country's multi-billion-pound wheat export industry . The EU imports more than one million metric tons of U.S. wheat each year, mostly to Spain. A farmer in Oregon raised the alarm a month ago after he found wheat growing ‘like a weed’ and could not kill it with herbicide. The rogue strain was developed by GM giant Monsanto and is resistant to herbicide Roundup, or glyphosate. It was field tested from 1998 to 2005, but worldwide opposition meant it was never commercially planted. Michael Firko of the US Department of Agriculture said the last Monsanto field test in Oregon was in 2001. Afterwards, crops were supposed to be totally removed. He added: ‘We’re all over this. We have nine investigators combing the area.’ About 90 per cent of Oregon’s wheat crop is exported. Agriculture officials insisted the GM strain wasn’t a health threat.","The brand's ice cream is already sold GMO-free in the European Union .

The man, known only as PH, is the first confirmed case of the disorder where his brain processes sight significantly slower than sound. Living in a badly dubbed world: A 67-year-old man hears people speak before he sees their lips move making all of his conversations appear out of sync (stock image) PH first started suffering the unusual symptoms after undergoing surgery. 'I said to my daughter ""hey, you've got . two TVs that need sorting!'"", he told New Scientist. But PH then realised that he was . hearing his own voice before feeling his jaw move. Doctors conducted scans of his brain which showed two lesions in areas that potentially play a role in hearing, . timing and movement. Light and sound travel at different speeds, so visual and auditory inputs arrive at the eyes and ears at different times. The signals are then processed at different rates in the brain but still appear as though they are happening simultaneously. Possible cause: The 67-year-old, only known as PH, only started suffering the symptoms after undergoing surgery. Scans show he has two lesions in the areas of the brain which play a role in hearing, timing and movement (stock image) PH's brain is believed to processes visual input much slower than it processes sound - causing the large time discrepancy. Elliot Freeman and colleagues at City University London performed several temporal order judgement tests using video clips to confirm the condition. They found that they had to play the sound 200 milliseconds later for PH to view it as in sync with the visual action . Mr Freeman is now looking for a way to slow down PH's hearing so it matches what he is seeing.","The man, known only as PH, started suffering the unusual sight and sound discrepancy shortly after undergoing surgery .

Himeji Central Park has seen three sets of extremely rare white lion cubs born at the zoo in the last month. The zoo now has a total of seven new additions to their growing white lion pride - a remarkable feat considering there are only believed to be around 300 in existence across the globe. We're all-white: Three white lion cubs pictured at just nine-days-old after being born at the Himeji Central Park on June 30 . Luck is delivered in threes: These young white lion cubs are the third set to be born at the Himeji Central Park in Japan within the last month . These adorable furballs, pictured at the amusement park in the city of Himeji, are the latest cubs to be born on June 30. They were born shortly after two other female white lions from South African giving birth to litters - on June 26 and June 6. The cubs will go on public display for the first time later this week. Zoo officials said this is the first time white lions have been born at a zoo in western Japan. White lions are not albinos. Like blue eyes in humans, the animals' white colour is caused by a recessive gene shared by both parents. Star attractions: Nine-day-old white lioness cubs, pictured in the arms of a zoo keeper, will go on public display for the first time later this week . Quite a handful: White lions are incredibly rare - with just 300 believed to be in existence around the world . White lions are native to only the Greater Timbavati region of South Africa, an area characterised by white sandy riverbeds and long grass scorched pale by the sun. They are regarded as sacred animals by the people of that region, but after Europeans 'discovered' them in the 1970s, many were taken from the wild to captive breeding and hunting operations, according to the Global White Lion Protection Trust. These removals, along with lion culling and trophy hunting of male lions, depleted the gene pool and the animals have technically been extinct in the wild for the past 12 years. In their natural habitat, white lions are regarded as 'apex predators', able to hunt successfully in day and night and take down prey as large as giraffes. Adorable: Zoo keepers at Himeji Central Park hold up four of the cubs, pictured at 13-days-old after being born on June 26 . Dinner time: Two of the young cubs are bottle fed by staff at the Himeji Central Park zoo in Japan . Despite their rarity, white lions are not yet classified as endangered because biologists still regard them as ultimately the same as their tawny equivalents. The Global White Lion Protection Trust is campaigning for white lions to be recognised as a subspecies of lions, so that they can be protected under international law. However, the genetic marker that makes white lions unique has not yet been identified by scientists and research into the animals is ongoing. The trust estimates that there are no more than 300 white lions in existence. In recent years it has reintroduced the animals to a nature reserve within Greater Timbavati in an effort to eventually reintroduce the gene to wild lions.

Critics say the trend for adults buying breast milk cheapens its natural function and the bond between mother and child . China's super-rich are paying thousands of dollars a month for human breast milk, with some even choosing to be wet nursed. The bizarre new trend has seen a rise in adults buying breast milk and drinking it either straight from the wet nurse or after it was expressed. Newspaper reports on the service have provoked outrage in China with tens of thousands of people posting on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. According to the Southern Metropolis .

Customers say they want the concentrated nutrition breast milk provides. It . has a unique combination of antibodies, living cells, enzymes, hormones . and fatty acids that has led some people to treat it as the latest . superfood. 'Adult (clients) can drink it directly through breastfeeding, or they can always drink . it from a breast pump if they feel embarrassed', Lin Jun, owner of . company Xinxinyu that offers the service, was quoted as saying by AFP. Critics say the practice turns a mother's milk into a commodity and cheapens the bond between mother and child. Chinese commentator Cao Baoyin wrote on his blog: 'This adds to China's problem of treating women as consumer goods and the moral degradation of China's rich', according to AFP. Nine out of ten people said they disagreed with the practice on an online poll. One user on Weibo called it 'disguised . pornography', while others said it was merely a form of novelty . entertainment for China's super rich.

For years the Les Rois hotel in the Egyptian resort of Hurghada offered guests the chance to enjoy a little tipple under the Red Sea sun. Men and women could mingle over a G&T at the rooftop pool bar or enjoy a pint downstairs in the English 'pub'. But last weekend, to cheers of 'God is Great', the owners poured the entire contents of their drinks cabinet down the the drain and declared Les Rois the resort's first official alcohol-free hotel. Alcohol free: The owners of Les Rois hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada are hoping to attract more conservative Muslim guests . And in a bid to further woo an increasingly important conservative Muslim clientele, they have created men-only floors and made the rooftop pool a women-only area patrolled by female security officers. While most mainstream Islamic scholars also agree that Islam forbids alcohol consumption, the changes appear to have garnered a mixed response. Last orders: The hotel owners pour bottles of booze down the drain . 'Excellent step!' read one tweet. 'The signs of the revolution are starting to appear in Egypt', read another. However other observers were less impressed - 'A hotel without liquor? Definitely a silly achievement for the president,' posted one indignant observer. The decision reflects deeper changes in Egypt following the 2011 uprising and the fall of Hosni Mubarak. Under President Mohamed Morsi's Muslim brotherhood alcohol restrictions have been tightened, segregated areas are springing up and citizens must declare the religion on their state ID cards. But tourism, for years the mainstay of the Egyptian economy, appears to be suffering, with the number of western visitors falling. Around 14.5 million people visited Egypt in 2010, accounting for 10 percent of economic activity and earning the country $12.5 billion. But visitors numbers fell to around 9.8 million the following year, reflecting political turmoil at the time, and have yet to recover to anywhere close to pre-revolution levels. One Hurghada hotel owner reported numbers down by as much as 50 per cent. The decision to go alcohol free can be seen as a move to attract more tourists from conservative middle-eastern states, who do not feel comfortable around boozy westerners. Hotel manager Abdelbasset Omar told the Guardian: 'At the moment many Middle Eastern men won't come to Hurghada because they won't get the privacy they require. 'We're trying to fill that gap in the market.' Industry: Tourism, for years the mainstay of the Egyptian economy, appears to be suffering following Egypt's 2011 uprising . In March the Egyptian government . doubled beer tax to 200 per cent and increased wine tax from 100 per . cent to 150 per cent. Alcohol was also banned from airport duty-free . shops. That followed . the announcement of plans in February to ban the sale of alcohol in . certain areas outside Cairo and to stop renewing alcohol licences. 'The previous regime would not have allowed this kind of hotel, because such a hotel wouldn't have reflected the image that Mubarak would have wanted for Egypt,' Hotel owner Omar added. Ringing the changes: Under Egypt's  President Mohammed Morsi's Muslim brotherhood party Alcohol restrictions are being tightened and taxes on booze have been raised . While the hotel has even gone so far as to remove pictures of western singers Elvis Presley and Shakira from the walls, a few things appear to have slipped the net.

The name of a girl who died of injuries suffered in the crash-landing of an Asiana Airlines flight in San Francisco emerged on Saturday.San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault confirmed 15-year-old Liu Yipeng's identity and said the girl was still in her seat when she was rescued last week. Chinese state media said she went to school with the other two victims killed in last week's accident, a pair of 16-year-old girls.Foucrault said Liu Yipeng was transported to San Francisco General Hospital with head injuries after the July 6 crash. She died Friday morning at San Francisco General Hospital where she had been in critical condition. An autopsy was being conducted on Saturday, the coroner said. Charred: Asiana Flight 214 burst into flames after crash landing July 6 at San Francisco International Airport . Liu Yipeng's identification comes a day after her death was announced amid the official confirmation that one of the other girls who died in the disaster had been covered on the runway in flame-retardant foam and hit by a fire truck speeding to the crash site, a disclosure that raised the tragic possibility she could have survived the crash only to die in its chaotic aftermath.Police and fire officials confirmed Friday that Ye Meng Yuan was hit by a fire truck racing to extinguish the blazing Boeing 777. ""The fire truck did go over the victim at least one time. Now the other question is, `What was the cause of death?'"" San Francisco police spokesman Albie Esparza said. ""That's what we are trying to determine right now.""All three girls killed were from China. Tragic: Ye Mengyuan, left, and Wang Linjia, right, are two of the three Chinese students killed the crash landing. No pictures of Liu Yipeng, the 3rd, have yet been made available . Ye Meng Yuan's close friend Wang Linjia was among a group of injured passengers who did not get immediate medical help. Rescuers did not spot her until 14 minutes after the crash. Wang Linjia's body was found along with three flight attendants who were flung onto the tarmac.Moments after the crash, while rescuers tried to help passengers near the burning fuselage, Wang Linjia and some flight attendants lay in the rubble almost 2,000 feet away. A group of survivors called 911 and tried to help them.Survivors said that after escaping the plane, they sat with at least four victims who appeared to be seriously hurt. They believe one of them was one of the girls who died. Beyond recognition: The charred remains of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 after crash landing in San Francisco . Cindy Stone, who was in that group, was recorded by California Highway Patrol dispatchers calling in for help: ""There are no ambulances here. We've been on the ground 20 minutes. There are people lying on the tarmac with critical injuries, head injuries. We're almost losing a woman here. We're trying to keep her alive.""San Francisco fire spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge said Friday that when airport personnel reached the group near the seawall, Linjia was dead. She did not know when the girl had died.Several flight attendants remain hospitalized. Miracle: Despite the cabin bursting into flames, only three people have so far been identified as dead . Talmadge also confirmed that an Associated Press photograph of a body under a yellow tarp near the burned-out jet was Ye Meng Yuan.The photo, taken from above, shows firefighters looking down at the tarp, and there are truck track marks leading up to it.Police said the teenager was covered in foam that rescuers had sprayed on the burning wreckage. When the truck moved while battling the flames, rescuers discovered her body, Esparza said.""The driver may not have seen the young lady in the blanket of foam,"" said Ken Willette of the National Firefighter Protection Agency, which sets national standards for training airfield firefighters. ""These could be factors contributing to this tragic event."" Panic: As fire trucks rushed to the scene, one may have hit and killed Liu Yipeng, 15, in the chaotic aftermath . He said fire trucks that responded to the Asiana crash would have started shooting foam while approaching the fuselage from 80 or 100 feet away. The foam was sprayed from a cannon on the top of the truck across the ground to clear a safe path for evacuees. That was supposed to create a layer of foam on the ground that is several inches high before the truck gets to the plane.The victims were close friends and top students, looking forward to spending a few weeks at a Christian summer camp in California, where they planned to practice English and boosting their chances of attending a U.S. college.Their parents were flown to San Francisco after their deaths where the Chinese consulate was caring for them. Remarkable: The tail of the Boeing 777 came completely off when the back section of the plane hit the runway's sea wall . The crash-landing occurred after the airliner collided with a rocky seawall just short the runway. Dozens of passengers were hurt. There were 182 survivors taken to hospitals, though most suffered only minor injuries.So far, an investigation indicates the pilots, a trainee and his instructor, failed to realize until too late that the aircraft was dangerously low and flying too slow.Nothing disclosed so far by the National Transportation Safety Board investigators indicates any problems with the Boeing 777's engines, computers or automated systems.Also, San Francisco airport officials said that the runway where the jet crashed was reopened Friday evening, and all airlines would resume normal schedules immediately.","A total of three people have been publicly identified as dead .

The wife of the new Bank of England governor has suggested that her family is struggling to to find a place live in London - despite his £874,000 pay packet. Diana Carney publicly bemoaned that an influx of wealthy French fleeing their socialist president’s hefty taxes has led to a lack of suitable housing in the capital. Mark Carney, a former £1 million a year Goldman Sachs banker, is taking up the Bank of England governor’s post this July. He will receive a £250,000 housing allowance - or £5,000 a week. New Bank of England governor Mark Carney's wife Diana has bemoaned the fact that she cannot find housing in London despite her £5,000 a week housing allowance . Mrs Carney tweeted a link to a story about how France’s President Hollande is scaling back taxes on the rich, with the remarks: ‘Maybe I’ll be able to find a place to live in London after all.’ With a housing allowance of £5,000 a week, they can certainly afford to look at some of the most exclusive addresses in London. Mrs Carney - who runs a left-wing think tank Canada2020 and has praised the anti-capitalist Occupy protest movement - also signalled she expected to take part in policy-making in the UK. Speaking in a TV interview broadcast on Sunday, she said: ‘My husband was brought in to bring new ideas and fresh thinking to the Bank of England, and I would hope that I can bring some ideas from Canada in the policy environment and learn from the UK, but also inject some perhaps new thinking in some of the areas with which we’re mutually dealing with the same issues.’ She cited income inequality as her top priority and also signalled that she hoped to work with Nick Clegg. Mr Carney is a former Bank of Canada Governor and will start his new role in July . ‘It’s been a big priority for the Deputy Prime Minister and they have a commission on what they call social mobility and I hope that I can continue working in this area and see if we can make some headway,’ she told Canada’s Global News programme, The West Block with Tom Clark. Before his appointment at the Bank of England, Mr Carney - the current governor of the Bank of Canada - was approached to become leader of the Canadian Liberals - a sister party of the Liberal Democrats. His wife’s remarks about the struggle to find accommodation in Britain sparked dismay from campaigners. John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the influential Treasury select committee, said: ‘Her husband is getting a housing allowance that is more than many of my constituents earn in ten years. I would be happy to help her find suitable accommodation. I’m prepared to move out of my London flat for her which will be available at just four per cent of her housing allowance.’ Mrs Carney linked to an article on Twitter that reported that French President Francois Hollande is to scale back taxes on the rich . Robert Oxley, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘While Diana Carney clearly recognises that punitive rates of taxation across the Channel are going to send people flocking to London, not many of us are lucky enough to have a taxpayer funded allowance to subsidise our homes.’ Mrs Carney, who was born in Britain, also said she was braced for interest from the public as part of a power couple. Asked if she could deal with press interest, she said: ‘We’ll do our best. I think we’re both pretty confident in who we are.’ The couple met at Oxford where they both played hockey. A daughter of a wealthy pig farmer, she attended the £31,000-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire before gaining a first in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at St John’s College, Oxford. During a grilling by the Treasury select committee last year, Mr Carney defended his remuneration package, which includes a salary of £624,000. This is £144,000 more than the current governor, Mervyn King, because Mr Carney has declined to have a pension. ‘The housing allowance relates to the fact that I’m moving from one of the cheapest capitals [Ottawa] to one of the most expensive capitals,’ he said. ‘It’s a relatively common arrangement for senior executives.’ Mr Carney will start his Threadneedle Street role on 1 July 2013.

Women jurors are a recent phenomenon in U.S. history and until the 1960s, numerous states still prohibited women jurors as the thinking was that women's place was in the home, not in the jury box. A jury of six women, five of them . white and the other a minority, decided George Zimmerman was not guilty . in the shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin. Now, many are now asking are questioning how the all-female jury affected the outcome of the trial. The women have spoken: George Zimmerman smiles after a not guilty verdict was handed down in his trial . The jurors were chosen during a nine-day selection process are known only by numbers to protect their identities. They ranged in age from their 30s to their 60s; one is Hispanic or black and the others are white. Five of the women are mothers. Before the trial began, one defense expert stated that the six women chosen to sit on the jury could be sympathetic to George Zimmerman's fate, although their views on guns, crime and community are more relevant in the deliberation room than their gender. Jose Baez, a Florida defense attorney who was lead defense counsel on the Casey Anthony case said an all-female jury was a 'slam-dunk' for the defense from the very start. Not guilty: A crowd gathers as prior to the verdict being delivered. Some saw an all-women jury as a 'slam dunk' for Zimmerman's defense team . 'I think the defense clearly won the day on this one,' Baez said. 'Any way you slice and dice it, this is a defense jury.' The trial wasn't a typical criminal case in that the women weren't be tasked with weighing whether George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin, but whether he was justified in killing the teen. For the female jurors, it is their understanding of when it's appropriate to use deadly force that was key. Two of the women reported they were familiar with guns. One even had the same kind of permit to carry a concealed weapon that Zimmerman was issued. Another of the jurors warned her two adolescent children not to go out at night because of Martin's shooting. The fact that five were white, and one was Hispanic was probably more of a boost for the defense than the fact they were women. During the trial they were known only by numbers, but their names will be released sometime later. B-51 . is retired, unmarried and doesn’t have kids. She has lived in Seminole . County for nine years working in real estate and run a call center where . she said she had experience resolving conflicts. When asked if . Zimmerman did something wrong by following Martin instead of waiting for . police, she said: 'Yeah, I guess he did do something wrong.' B-29 . recently moved to central Florida from Chicago. She enjoys watching the . 'Real Housewives' on television and works as a nurse on an Alzheimer’s . section of a nursing home. She said she hadn’t paid much attention to . the shooting. She said she has been arrested, but her case was dropped. It’s not clear why she was arrested or exactly what happened to her . case, though she said she was treated fairly. She is married and has . several children. A prosecutor described her as 'black or Hispanic' during jury selection. B-76 is a white woman who has . lived in central Florida for 18 years. She manages rental properties . with her husband of 30 years. She has two adult children, including one . who is an attorney. She is involved with rescuing animals in her free . time. During jury selection, she said she had been the victim of a . nonviolent crime. 'Everyone deserves a fair trial,' she said. B-37 . is a white woman who volunteers rescuing animals. She is married to an . attorney and has two adult children. She said she and her husband used . to have concealed weapons permits.

She describes herself as a football fan. During jury selection, she said she had been the victim of a nonviolent . crime. Relief: George Zimmerman's family celebrate as the jury clear him of all charges . Brian Tannebaum, president of the Florida Association of Bar Defense Lawyers and past president of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers agreed. 'There's always that notion of men and women viewing things differently - that women can be more sympathetic, or can listen better than men,' Tannebaum said. 'But I have no idea how to gauge a jury in a case like this, where the facts are not your typical facts.' Holly McCammon, a professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University believes that the all-female jury  had no effect on the ultimate decision in this case. 'Research shows that no one juror trait, including gender, is an accurate indicator of how a juror will vote,' she says. 'The best predictor of whether a juror will side with the prosecution or defense is a mix of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, political ideology, personality and attitudes.' Ms. McCammonis the author of 'The U.S. Women's Jury Movements and Strategic Adaptation: A More Just Verdict.' She believes that the gender makeup of juries rarely shapes the verdict in a trial. George Zimmerman listens to the charges against him read by Judge Debra Nelson, in Seminole circuit court during his trial . 'Women are now full citizens when it . comes to jury service. If a man is being tried by an all-woman jury, he . is likely being tried by a jury of his peers. The . gender makeup of the jury is not likely to be pivotal in determining . the verdict in the Zimmerman trial. The evidence is what matters in the . outcome. But our public . attention to the fact of an all-female jury shows that we are still . conditioned to think in gendered ways,' she says. At . the time the jury was selected, Ben Crump, a lawyer for the Martin . family, said, 'With the makeup of this jury, the issue of whether every . American can get equal justice no matter who serves on this jury panel . will be answered. And we expect the jury pool to do its duty and follow . the law,' he said. Gracie Zimmerman, left, sister of George Zimmerman, his father, Robert Zimmerman Sr., second from left, his mother, Gladys, second from right, and wife Shellie Zimmerman, right, sit in Seminole circuit court . Prosecutors and defense attorneys chose the panel of six jurors after almost two weeks of jury selection. In Florida, 12 jurors are required only for criminal trials involving capital cases, when the death penalty is being considered. Martin's . shooting death and the initial decision not to charge Zimmerman led to . public outrage and demonstrations around the nation, with some accusing . Sanford police of failing to thoroughly investigate the shooting. The six jurors were culled from a pool of 40 jury candidates. A jury made up entire from women allows armchair trial lawyers to speculate on how gender might have influenced the verdict. Did . the women sympathize with someone who claimed to be in fear for his . life? Two of the female jurors themselves own guns for self-defense. Did they sympathize with the tragic loss of a teenage son? Five of the jurors are mothers. These . questions evoke the larger and largely unspoken issue at the heart of . any jury selection - do women decide cases differently?

According . to Bruce Rowe, a ranger at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore park . along Lake Michigan, the boy's family said he was playing on the dune . Friday when he dropped partially into it. The 6-year-old was walking with his . parents along the sand dunes in Michigan City when he came across a . rotted tree that may have caused the collapse, . 'Miracle': It took crews using heavy excavating equipment more than three hours to pull the boy out from under 11 feet of sand . While they were trying to dig him out, the dune collapsed, burying the boy under 11 feet of sand, he said. The . family called 911, and emergency responders were on the scene within 15 . minutes and began digging by hand, Rowe said. Crews with excavating . equipment were brought in to aid the rescue effort. Martin . told the South Bend, Ind.-area TV station that firefighters located the . boy while prodding the dune, right after they detected the air pocket . that enabled him to survive for so long underground. They pulled him out and the boy was rushed to a Michigan City hospital, then later flown to Comer. LaPorte County Deputy Coroner Mark Huffman told The News-Dispatch of Michigan City that the boy's survival was a 'miracle.' 'It is totally amazing,' he said. Authorities were puzzled about the cause of the collapse, which Rowe called 'unprecedented.' The . section of the dune, which is more than 125 feet high and is known as . Mount Baldy, had been cordoned off for restoration work. Vacationers: Family members of Nathan Reul, the 6-year-old boy who was buried in the sand at Mount Baldy are escorted to the beach by a Michigan City Police Department chaplain .

Protest of innocence: Bill Boal, pictured here arriving for trial in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was accused of taking part in the Great Train Robbery . The family of a man convicted over the Great Train Robbery have launched a fresh appeal nearly 50 years on to clear his name, with one gang member declaring 'he had absolutely nothing to do with it'. Bill Boal was one of 12 men jailed for the audacious crime in August 1963, which resulted in the gang taking £2.5 million from the Glasgow-to-London Night Mail train. Boal, who was sentenced to 24 years - later reduced to 14 on appeal - died in 1970 from cancer while still in prison. He always protested his innocence. Now robber Roger Cordrey's son Tony has spoken out by stating what Boal's family always believed - that the engineer from Fulham, west London was not involved in the robbery. Speaking to the Sunday People, he said: 'Bill was totally innocent. Dad said many, many times Bill had absolutely nothing to do with the robbery.' His statement comes as Boal's family revealed they are preparing a file asking the Criminal Case Review Commission to look again at their father’s case. If successful, they hope to convince the Appeal Court to reverse his conviction and clear his name. It will include testimony from gang members and include evidence ruled out of the original trial. Boal was convicted after the police . found him with Cordery's car, which contained £141,000 - his friend's share of the massive haul. He always maintained that he was unaware of the stolen money - and other gang members have supported this. Nick Reynolds, the son of convicted robber Bruce Reynolds, told the Sunday People: 'Bill never played any part in it and the rest of the guys were completely stunned when he was convicted.' Bill Boal always protested his innocence, but was convicted, jailed for 24 years and died in prison from cancer . Police lead away three of the 12 men convicted of the audacious crime . Crime of the century: The Royal Mail train targeted by robbers nearly 50 years ago . Reynolds, who died earlier this year aged 81, also left a hand-written statement confirming Boal was never involved. Boal's family hope the relatives of other gang members will now come forward to help their fight for justice. His son David, 62, said Boal's conviction 'virtually destroyed' his life and those of his mother Renee, his brother Anthony and sister, Debbie. 'We carry the scars – some of them very open and very real – to this day.' Boal met Cordrey after lodging with his family in Hampton, west London. The two became friends and shared a love of racing, snooker and gambling. Both their worlds were shattered following the events of August 8, 1963, dubbed by police as 'the crime of the century'. Hideout: Leatherslade Farm in Buckinghamshire was used by the gang in the days following the robbery . The gang laid low for five days at Leatherslade Farm – 17 miles from the ambush site near Ledburn, Beds – before splitting the money and dispersing. Soon afterwards, Cordrey rang Boal to tell him he could repay a debt that he owed his friend. He invited Boal to join him in a 'project' in Bournemouth – and Bill decided to combine it with a family trip to the seaside. They travelled by train to Oxford, where Cordrey met them in his new Rover. Boal's son Anthony noticed bags and cases, which he thought were filled with fishing tackle for their trip. There were so many that the children had to sit on them during the trip to Dorset. In fact the bags contained the stolen money, which would be worth £2.6million today. Once they arrived in Bournemouth, Boal sent his wife and children to the beach while Cordrey asked him to help him find a garage and flat to rent and to buy another car. Defending Boal: Roger Cordrey (third from right) told his son Tony that Boal was not involved in the robbery. Also pictured are fellow gang members Buster Edwards, Tom Wisbey, Jim White, Bruce Reynolds, Charles Wilson and Jim Hussey . Boal's sons believe Cordrey also gave their father £220, with a promise of giving him another £430 in another couple of days, to repay the entire debt. But within a week of the robbery, both were arrested after offering to pay cash for three months’ rent on a lock-up garage. The owner was a policeman’s widow, who became suspicious of the amount of money owned by the pair.Two years later, Boal told a lawyer that he had only stayed with Cordrey because he believed his debt would eventually be settled. Boal died in June 1970, four months after Jack Mills, the train driver who violently coshed in the robbery. Victim: Bruce Reynolds, pictured with his wife Angela prior to his death earlier this year, maintained that Boal was innocent in his autobiography . He protested his innocence until the end and had written letters addressed to the European Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the Official Solicitor. Gang member Bruce Reynolds also spoke of Boal as a 'victim' in his autobiography: 'Bill Boal was a victim of the judicial process. 'And while we, the Great Train Robbers, accept responsibility for injuring Jack Mills, I’ve yet to hear of anyone ­accepting responsibility for what was done to Bill Boal.'","Bill Boal was one of 12 convicted for the audacious crime in August 1963 .

The Rail Minister shamed into giving up his chauffeur-driven car following a public outcry is back  in his Government limo – after finding the daily commute by train too gruelling. Simon Burns is risking the wrath of David Cameron by using his £80,000-a-year official car to travel to Westminster. The Mail on Sunday revealed  earlier this year that Mr Burns was picked up from his constituency home in Essex every morning, driven the 35 miles to his Westminster office and dropped back home again in the evening. The disclosure triggered a furious reaction from commuter groups. At it again: Rail minister Simon Burns, MP arrives for work at the House of Commons in his chauffeur driven car . Off road: Mr Burns is pictured on the train journey from Chelmsford into London . Downing Street ordered Mr Burns, who is responsible for ‘rail strategy’ and ‘fares policy’, to take the train instead, and the Minister joined other commuters from Chelmsford station. He was pictured looking miserable as he failed to find a seat and stood swaying in the ‘vestibule’ area between carriages in a packed train. However, at 7am on Thursday, Mr Burns was photographed arriving at the House of Commons in the comfort of the back seat of his Toyota Avensis. Whitehall sources say the 60-year-old chain-smoking Oxford graduate, who is a cousin of rock star David Bowie, now usually stays in London from Monday to Thursday and goes back to his constituency only at weekends. He is collected from his new base in the capital each morning in his official Toyota Avensis and taken either to his MP’s office in the  Commons or his ministerial office in the Department for Transport. Controversy: How the Mail On Sunday broke the story that Simon Burns was taking an £80,000 limo to work back in January . Contrast: Transport Minister Norman Baker (centre) takes the train twice a week on the 120-mile round trip to his Lewes constituency, and otherwise travels from his London home to his office on foot or bus . The driver also frequently ferries him between the two offices, which are just one third of a mile apart. The . Avensis, one of two pool cars used by the department, costs the . taxpayer an annual £80,000, including driver salary, maintenance and . other costs. The . revelation is likely to add to the Government’s embarrassment over MPs’ perks, following a storm of protest over last week’s proposal that they . should receive a bumper pay rise of £7,400. And, worryingly for Mr Burns, it comes just days before Mr Cameron prepares to announce a reshuffle of his ministerial ranks. Bad timing: Worryingly for Mr Burns, it comes just days before David Cameron prepares to announce a reshuffle of his ministerial ranks . Friends of Mr Burns say that  he found it impossible to work on the trains between Chelmsford  and London. When . this newspaper initially disclosed Mr Burns’ travel arrangements in . January, he argued that he was barred by official rules from working on . confidential papers on the train. The claim was denied by the Cabinet . Office. In contrast, fellow Transport Minister Stephen Hammond usually uses public transport to travel the eight miles to his Wimbledon home, while Liberal Democrat Under-Secretary Norman Baker takes the train twice a week on the 120-mile round trip to his Lewes constituency, and otherwise travels from his London home to his office on foot or bus. Labour MP Fabian Hamilton said: ‘I think it is a shame that the Rail Minister doesn’t seem keen to use the railways. He is responsible for the quality of the journey endured by commuters, but will not stoop to join them.’ And David Brigg, chairman of commuter group the Witham and Braintree Rail Users Association, said: ‘How can we go to the local MP, who also happens to be the Rail Minister, about commuting problems if he is not experiencing the same  trials and tribulations of the journey into London as us?’ Sources close to Mr Burns said he would not be claiming for the cost of his London accommodation on expenses, and added that when he travelled between the constituency and Westminster at weekends, he either drove himself or took the train. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Simon Burns regularly uses trains, including to and from his constituency. As an MP he has always spent nights in London, particularly when Parliament is sitting late. Any night in the capital comes at no expense to the taxpayer.’","Simon Burns had given up his chaffeur-driven car following a public outcry .

One in a million: Golfer Brian Hughes sank two holes-in-one in just half an hour at Ampfield Golf Club in Hampshire . A golfer who returned to the game for the first time in 30 years defied the odds to amazingly sink two holes-in-one in just half an hour. Brian Hughes might have been forgiven for being slightly rusty having not picked up a club for almost three decades. But the 51-year-old bagged the unbelievable one-in-a-million feat in just 30 minutes during two separate rounds at Ampfield Golf Club. Mr Hughes' achievement was even more incredible given that he only took up the sport again - after a long absence - two months ago. The IT systems architect shot his first ace at about 9am on the 13th hole of the course in Ampfield, Hants, while playing with his friends. And an even louder cheer erupted when Brian sank his second hole-in-one just half an hour later while playing a different round with his wife, Sarah. Mr Hughes, a stepfather-of-three from Romsey, Hants, said: 'The first one landed in the hole with an enormous clatter and people were soon shouting and hollering. 'I saw the second one bounce on to the green before it went out of sight and when I walked up to the hole it was in the cup. 'My wife was so excited because she's never seen someone get a hole-in-one before.' Hughes, a former Welsh international youth amateur, gave up golf in the mid-1980s to concentrate on his university degree and career. The odds of a professional tour player making an ace is about 3,000 to one, while for an average player the odds are 12,000 to one. And for any player to make a brace of aces in the same round would come at staggering odds of 67 million to one. Jubilant: The 51-year-old hadn't played the game for 30 years, which made his accomplishment even more remarkable . Both holes were par 3. Alex Donahue, from bookmakers Ladbrokes, said Hughes' feat has odds of more than one million to one. Ampfield club captain Kevan Vear said: 'To get one ace is always amazing but to get two in the same day is just unbelievable.'","Amateur Brian Hughes, 51, pulls off incredible feat at Ampfield Golf Club in Hampshire ."

Pressure: Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and CEO of News Corporation, has been asked by MPs to explain his recorded comments criticising the police . Rupert Murdoch has been challenge by MPs to explain his secretly recorded comments criticising the ‘totally incompetent’ police inquiries into phone hacking and corrupt payments. The News Corp boss faces a police investigation over the tapes in which he criticises the ‘unbelievable’ treatment of journalists and he suggests he knew about corrupt payments to public officials. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, has given the media tycoon five days to respond to a demand for an explanation. In the tapes, Murdoch expresses his fury at ‘incompetent police’ as he tries to placate staff furious at dawn raids at their homes, arrests and criminal charges. In one exchange, the News Corp boss is told that dubious ‘working practices’ at News International went back many years. He says: ‘We’re talking about payments for news tips from cops. That’s been going on a hundred years, absolutely. You didn’t instigate it.’ Critics say the tape shows Murdoch’s real attitude to the crisis, in contrast to the apparent contrition he displayed when giving evidence to MPs two years ago. The request from Mr Vaz follows evidence to the committee from the Metropolitan Police's assistant commissioner Cressida Dick who said since May ‘voluntary co-operation (with News UK) has been significantly reduced and all requests for new material are now supervised by the courts’. Miss Dick also said that Scotland Yard was trying to get a copy of the recording of Mr Murdoch, and added: ‘We will then assess the full contents of that tape.’ On the secret tape Mr Murdoch is heard railing at the way the police behaved. ‘Still, I mean, it's a disgrace. Here we are, two years later, and the cops are totally incompetent,’ he said. ‘The idea that the cops then started coming after you, kick you out of bed, and your families, at six in the morning, is unbelievable. ‘But why are the police behaving in this way? It's the biggest inquiry ever, over next to nothing. ‘And now they're arresting their own, who never even took money. They're going to put all newspapers out of business.’ Scroll down for video . The last time: Mr Murdoch memorably addressed the culture select committee in July 2007 . When one of the journalists present questioned why so much material had been handed over to the police by News Corp's management and standards committee (MSC), Mr Murdoch indicated that he believed they had gone too far. ‘Because - it was a mistake, I think. But, in that atmosphere, at that time, we said, 'Look, we are an open book, we will show you everything'. And the lawyers just got rich going through millions of emails,’ he said. He added: ‘All I can say is, for the last several months, we have told, the MSC has told, and (name withheld), who's a terrific lawyer, has told the police, has said 'No, no, no - get a court order. Deal with that'.’ In his letter Mr Vaz told Mr Murdoch: ‘The Committee has asked that I write to you and give you a chance to respond to the reported comments you made to a meeting of Sun employees in March and recorded in a tape apparently leaked to Exaro news, and to the comments made by AC Dick and Commander (Neil) Basu regarding yourself and News UK (formerly News International).’ He said it would be ‘very helpful’ if the media mogul could respond to the request by noon on July 17. Mr Murdoch is also expected to be recalled to appear before MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport select committee in the autumn to answer questions over the tape.","Media mogul recorded telling staff police were 'totally incompetent'

A man who was caught on camera beating pigs to death at a 'hell hole' farm was jailed today for animal cruelty. Geoffrey Towell, 54, was seen hitting five sows with a plastic pipe - beating one of the sows 35 times. He also killed three pigs by smashing them on the head with a metal bar and using unnecessary force. His colleague James Dove, 27, was filmed hitting sows with a plastic pipe and throwing pigs over a barrier. Both men were filmed picking up pigs by their ears and dropping them on the ground at Harling Farm in Norfolk. The undercover investigator who captured . the abuse footage - too graphic to be shown in full below - branded the farm a 'hell hole' and said he saw . 'suffering and death' he will never be able to forget. Scroll down for video - EXTREMELY GRAPHIC CONTENT . Campaign group Animal Equality filmed terrible scenes of animal cruelty at Harling Farm, Norfolk, for two months last summer . An undercover investigation revealed horrific animal cruelty at Harling Farm, Norfolk . One emaciated pig was filmed with a hernia clearly protruding from its body in a case that ranked 'among the worst cases of animal cruelty' the district judge at Norwich Magistrates' Court had ever heard . Shamed farm owner Stephen Brown took his own life after the abuse to his animals was uncovered . Towell was jailed today for 18 weeks and Dove was handed a suspended jail sentence for animal cruelty. The horrific abuse was uncovered in secret filming by campaign group Animal Equality. The footage showed workers beating pigs with iron bars, battering piglets, scraping knives across their backs and smashing animals onto concrete floors. More than 200 hours of sickening footage and 300 photographs were collected by the charity’s investigator. The evidence, gathered over two months last summer, also exposed long term neglect and horrific brutal animal torture. The case was described as 'among the worst cases of animal cruelty I have seen' by a district judge at Norwich Magistrates' Court. Shamed Harling Farm owner Stephen Brown, 52, shot himself in the head in a suspected suicide on Valentine's Day this year, three days after the investigation was released to the media. The farm had been certified by the Red Tractor food quality scheme - which claims to ensure food is produced ethically and to 'high standards of safety'. The Red Tractor label is supposed to give food quality assurances to customers and retailers. It is still being investigated which stores stock meat from Harling Farm. The undercover investigator recounted the horrific moment Towell battered a pig to death with an iron bar. He said: 'Geoff grabbed the handle from the gate as usual and smashed it over the head of one of the sick piglets. 'It took him several blows before he finally cracked the skull, sending the animal into spasm. 'He then shouted at me to help him throw the animal into the dead bin. 'It took me a few seconds to react as I just cannot get used to him doing this. 'The blood was pumping out of the animal’s head, and pieces of brain. 'I got hold of the leg and the blood went all over my boots, the floor and the dead bin. 'As soon as the piglet was inside the bin, Geoff put the lid on and walked away.' Towell from East Harling, Norfolk, pleaded guilty to five counts of cruelty to pigs and piglets, contrary to Animal Welfare Act 2006. Farm worker Geoffrey Towell has been jailed for 18 weeks for his part in the terrible abuse inflicted on animals at Harling Farm, pictured, while colleague James Dove received a suspended jail sentence . He also pleaded guilty to one charge of failing to protect pigs from pain and suffering, contrary to the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Towell also admitted using unnecessary force to handle piglets and one charge of failing to protect pigs from pain and suffering, by lifting pigs by the ears and dropping them from waist height. He was jailed for 18 weeks and banned from the keeping, managing, husbandry, care or control of farm animals for 10 years. Dove, from Wymondham, Norfolk, who now works as a lorry driver, pleaded guilty to two charges of cruelty by kicking and hitting sows with a plastic pipe and throwing pigs over a barrier. He also pleaded guilty to two charges of failing to protect animals from suffering by lifting pigs by the ear and leg, dropping them to the ground and kicking them while moving them. He was given an eight week jail sentence, suspended for a year, and ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work. In mitigation both workers told Norwich Magistrates’ Court they were sorry for their actions, that they had received no training and they had asked for help. A third farm worker accepted a formal caution from the RSPCA. Chief Inspector Mark Thompson, the RSPCA’s farm animal welfare officer, said: 'The cruelty meted out by these two men was sickening. 'They showed absolutely no respect or compassion for the pigs in their care and instead treated them with hostility, violence and aggression. 'This repulsive behaviour is a huge blow for farmers who are going the extra mile for animal welfare.'","Geoffrey Towell, 54, jailed for 18 weeks after undercover filming revealed horrific abuse at Harling Farm, Norfolk .

A vote is scheduled for Monday . Theresa May has backed down in a battle over keeping Britain in the controversial European Arrest Warrant system. The Home Secretary infuriated Eurosceptic MPs this week by giving them less than a week to digest her proposals before voting on Monday. She wants to opt out of 130 EU measures on justice and home affairs and retain 35, including the arrest warrants. A Government source said the Tory whips’ office had been thrown into ‘panic’ by the scale of opposition to her plan. She was warned the Government faced defeat if Labour joined with Tory Eurosceptics to call for a delay. But in a major shift yesterday Mrs May said MPs would now be given until October to examine the plans. Three Commons select committees will now report on the issues before the Government starts negotiations with the EU this autumn. Tory Eurosceptic Peter Bone, welcomed the climbdown but said it did not go far enough. ‘We need assurances that we are not going to be bounced into accepting this. We also want a vote on every one of these measures before we opt back in,’ he said. Ministers remain on stand-by for a vote on Monday. That is because of fears the Government could lose if a cross-party consensus forms around calls for even greater scrutiny than Mrs May has now offered. The Arrest Warrant has been criticised after a string of cases in which British citizens have been extradited and held on remand to stand trial on minor charges. But senior police officers pushed ministers to stay in the system, arguing that it helps them apprehend suspects who flee to other parts of the EU.

A vicious pervert is facing a life sentence after a savage attack on a 23-month-old girl after a series of blunders by social services . Christopher Atkins, 30, tried to hide his face as he arrived at court before a jury found him guilty of sexual assault and child cruelty by neglect. After the case it emerged social workers did not spot injuries to the toddler and there were delays carrying out background checks which would have revealed Atkins was suspected of previous assaults on another child. Vile: Pervert Christopher Atkins who was found guilty of sexual assault and child cruelty at Nottingham Crown Court . The latest victim was brought to hospital heavily bleeding with 18 separate injuries to her body, including bite marks, burns and a fracture. She would have died without medical attention. Judge Michael Stokes, QC, warned Atkins at Nottingham Crown Court: 'I regard this as a quite appalling piece of behaviour. I am certainly . thinking of passing a life sentence.' The child was under a child protection plan and cannot be named for legal reasons. Atkins' former partner, Sarah Sheppard, 24, from Bideford, Devon, had earlier admitted child cruelty by neglect. Facing a life sentence: Pervert Christopher Atkins who attacked a toddler . A Daily Mirror investigation found that the child’s social worker in Nottingham, Sharon Smith, had concerns about Atkins but failed to record them on the council’s database before she went on sick leave. Warning: Judge Michael Stokes told Atkins: ' I am thinking of passing a life sentence' Ms Smith, who has since returned to her job, blamed her workload, saying she was 'shattered, exhausted and overworked', according to the paper. There was also a delay in carrying out requested background checks on Atkins. He had previously been investigated by police and social services in Manchester over an 18-month-old boy who suffered serious injuries, including a fractured leg and a broken nose. But police could not prove whether Atkins or another adult was responsible. An independent review found 'considerable shortcomings' by Nottinghamshire children’s services and said proper checks could have 'lessened the possibility of abuse occurring'. Atkins reportedly told police he had injured the girl by accident but later denied any responsibility. He had met Sheppard online and within weeks she moved with the child from Devon to Nottingham to be near him. The child's father told the Mirror: 'I feel totally let . down by the system. I . asked social services and police to do the checks on this maniac and . their failure resulted in my daughter being battered and sexually abused . and maimed for life before she was even two years old.' Steve Edwards, Nottinghamshire county council’s service director for children’s social care said: 'This is a very serious offence and we are pleased that justice has been done. 'The council regrets that the background checks on Mr Atkins were not undertaken in a timely manner.'","Christopher Atkins was suspected of previously assaulting another child, but there were delays on background checks .

A man who dropped a dumbbell on his friend’s face as he attempted to go to sleep leaving him scarred for life has been jailed for four-and-a-half years. Graham Smith agreed to put him up the victim at his home in Easington Village, County Durham, several days before the incident. At Durham Crown Court, Ros Scott Bell, prosecuting, said they were drinking at the house with others for much of the day on Saturday September 22. Smith became ‘argumentative’ and complained when the other man said he wanted to go to sleep in the early hours of the following morning. The ‘guest’ retired upstairs to a spare room, converted into a ‘gym room’, where he lay on a cushion, at 3.30am. Smith entered carrying the 5kg dumbbell and tried to strike up a conversation, but the other man said he just wanted to go to sleep. Miss Scott Bell said: 'The next thing he knew felt the impact to his face, with the defendant standing close above him. The complainant briefly blacked out. 'When he came round he was cut to the face and the defendant was shouting to him to get out of the house. 'He ran to a phone box at the top of the street, rang the police and stayed there until officers arrived.' Miss Scott Bell said the 23-year-old victim went to hospital suffering a 5cm laceration above the left eye and a cut to the temple. He received nine stitches under local anaesthetic and had to return to hospital for further pain relief treatment, but will be permanently scarred.

Looking relaxed, Andrew Marr briefly returns to his  own Sunday programme today doing what he does best – grilling politicians. The 53-year-old broadcaster will make his first appearance  on the show as interviewer since he had a stroke six months ago. He questions former Labour Foreign Secretary David Miliband in what is the ex-MP’s last interview before he moves to New York to become chief executive of the charity International Rescue Committee. In the pre-recorded ten-minute slot, Mr Marr grills Mr Miliband on Syria and on whether it is right for the Egyptian military to have imprisoned ousted President Morsi. Mr Marr will return to the show full time in September. 'You have to take it bit by bit and I always wanted to come back in the autumn as it’s the natural beginning of the political year,' said Marr. 'But I also felt that I’m thinking and talking fine. My walking is a bit wobbly, but so what?' He briefly appeared as a guest on the show in April, but his return to interviewing shows a remarkable – and continuing – recovery only nine months after he tore the carotid artery while exercising on a rowing machine in his garden shed. He said his return to the interviewer’s chair 'felt really good and really natural'. It will be Miliband’s final interview before the former MP flies to New York to start his new role as chief executive of the charity International Rescue Committee. 'This is the first of my padding steps back to full-time,' said Marr. 'I’m really looking forward to getting back full-time for the new political season.' The 53-year-old journalist has no shortage of work in the pipeline: he is filming a documentary on German chancellor Angela Merkel next week and has lined up another 'big interview' this side of the summer – although he declined to reveal who will face his questions. Marr has described how he was struck by 'a blinding headache and flashes of light'. He woke up the next morning lying on his bedroom floor, unable to move, after suffering a serious stroke overnight. He was paralysed down his left side but the area of the brain that controls speech and memory was unaffected. His appetite for reading and writing, too, is undimmed. Andrew Marr and his wife arrive Jackie Ashley have been adjusting to a slower pace of life since his stroke . He recently finished writing the first draft of a novel with the help of a computerised dictation system, and has also worked on an updated book on Scottish politics and another on his love of drawing. In an interview with the Daily Mail this month, Marr described how he was living a 'brittle, narrow, overstressed life' before his stroke and said he was a happier 'and slightly nicer' person than before the incident.

Patrick Olszowski, campaigns and policy manager at the charity Stroke Association, said Marr’s recovery would provide inspiration to the one million people living with the aftermath of the condition in the UK. 'I would totally applaud Andrew Marr for his fortitude,' he said. 'What stroke survivors want more than anything else is hope that their life is not over,' he added.

With its beautifully decorated hall, stunning array of rooms and 1,100 acres of land, this Tudor-style mansion built exactly 100 years ago is currently on the market for a cool £11m. But legend has it the property fell into the hands of the current owner's family more than 140 years ago after it was won in a game of cards. The current form of the mansion on the Hamptworth Lodge Estate, situated within the New Forest National Park, in Wiltshire, was designed by Tudor expert Harold Moffat between 1910 and 1913 after he inherited it in 1884. The estate itself has been in the same . family however since 1870, when it fell into the hands of the . great-great uncle to the current owners. Mansion: The Hamptworth Estate has been in the hands of the same family since 1870, but was rebuilt between 1910 and 1913 . Impressive: The Great Hall features the sister organ to the one at Salisbury Cathedral . Detailed: The mansion was designed in a Jacobean style by Tudor expert Harold Moffat . James Grillo, head of the country house department at estate agents Chesterton Humberts, said: 'The family who own it now, legend has it that it was won in a game of cards.' Oxford professor Mr Moffat, who at the time was one of the foremost world-renowned experts in Tudor furniture, developed the site after it was passed on to him. Mr Grillo said: 'He already owned another estate in Herefordshire but when he inherited this estate he knocked down the original house and built a Tudor mansion to show off his collection of Tudor furniture. 'The building was completed in 1913 - it is 100 years old this year. 'It is a Tudor-style house to look at in every way but it was actually an Edwardian build.' Originally one of the original Royal . Hunting Lodges in the New Forest, the estate is currently being sold as . four separate lots, or altogether for a total of £11m. Well-kept: The estate features some fantastically-kept gardens, although there has been the odd ghostly-sighting in the grounds as well . Heritage: The estate itself has been in the same family since 1870, when it fell into the hands of the great-great uncle to the current owners . Legend: According to legend the family won the estate in a game of cards . Mr Grillo said: 'The original house had evolved and was enlarged many times and our client's forebears knocked down a Georgian house which was there and replaced it with this Edwardian build in the Tudor style. 'Because Mr Moffat was one of the foremost experts in Tudor furniture it is fantastically detailed as far as the timber work and structure is concerned. 'He took himself off to become a carpenter with a boat builder on the Thames and he became a master craftsmen in his own right. 'He oversaw and did a lot of building himself. Bedroom: Mr Moffat knocked down a Georgian building to make way for the current mansion . Historic: The estate itself can be traced back to at least the 11th century . Tradition: Each room is designed in a Jacobean-style, despite the fact it was only built 100 years ago . Ghostly encounters: The house is believed to be haunted, according to the current owners . 'So you have an incredibly detailed timber building. At the end of each beam there are little carvings such as lizards or snakes or little dragon flies which identify which carpenter made that beam, and that's how it would have been in Tudor times.' Other features in the mansion include the organ in the Great Hall, which is in fact the sister organ to one in Salisbury Cathedral, while a small detail in the windows in the drawing room illustrate Mr Moffat's eye for detail. Mr Grillo said: 'Another little detail is the glass - etched into the glass of about seven or eight windows in the drawing room are love poems, etched into the glass with a diamond ring, which the Tudors also would have done when first declaring their love.' Grounds: Mr Moffat built the house to show off his collection of Tudor furniture . Grounds: The mansion is set within 1,100 acres of land in the New Forest National Park . For sale: The estate is being sold as four lots are altogether for a combined £11m . But as you might expect with a house which dates back to at least the 11th century, there have been a number of ghostly encounters on the estate. Mr Grillo said although there were no specific ghost stories, he was certain there was a presence which comes along with property. He said: 'There's no doubt about it, I'm sure the house is haunted but they all seem to be very friendly and nice encounters. 'I think in the gardens there has been one or two encounters and people have heard things on the landing and that sort of thing.'","Mansion in its current form was built between 1910 and 1913 by Tudor expert Harold Moffat .

An investigation into the Hillsborough disaster and the way in which South Yorkshire Police handled its aftermath has found that another 55 officers may have had their statements about the tragedy altered. The Hillsborough Indepedent Panel inquiry had already identified 164 ammended accounts from officers in September last year, but a subsequent probe by the Independent Police Complaints Commission has found evidence of additional changed statements. The panel had originally found that 116 of those 164 statements had comments 'unfavourable' to South Yorkshire Police changed or completely removed. New claims: A fresh probe by the Independent Police Complaints Commission has said that another 55 police officers may have had their accounts of the Hillsborough tragedy, pictured, amended . The IPCC said that the new statements are currently being analysed and investigators will begin interviewing the 164 officers who have already been identified as having their story changed later this month. Ninety six Liverpool fans were killed in a crush at Sheffield’s Hillsborough stadium on April 15 1989 during The Reds’ FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. The IPCC announced on October 12 that it would be launching an independent investigation into allegations surrounding the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, following a review of the panel’s report. The investigation is reviewing allegations surrounding amendments to statements, the actions of the police officers after the disaster and the role of West Midlands Police and those who investigated what happened at the time. A separate team led by by former Durham chief constable Jon Stoddart is investigating a range of organisations involved in the preparation for the event and what happened on the day. Probe: The IPCC investigation was launched after the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel found a cover up of the tragedy's aftermath . The IPCC is managing the strand of the investigation looking into the actions of the police. In its monthly update, the IPCC said its Hillsborough Contact Team had received more than 230 pieces of correspondence since October, more than 50 relating to statements. Deborah Glass, IPCC deputy chairwoman, said: 'The IPCC knows the people who have contacted us are the tip of the iceberg. 'Therefore preparations are ongoing for an appeal for witnesses to the disaster and this is expected to be conducted in the autumn. 'The preparations will include work with appropriate agencies to provide welfare support where needed to those who will have to recount the traumatic events of 15 April 1989.' Search for the truth: Fresh inquests are to be held into the deaths of the 96 who died next year. Family members of those were killed and survivors have campaigned for more than two decades for justice . The IPCC has recovered 97 per cent of the documentation originally supplied to the panel and identified additional documentation not previously disclosed. The watchdog's investigators found documents belonging to West Midlands Police, which was involved in the investigation in the last few months. Investigators have now asked for confirmation that no more undisclosed documents are in existence. The police watchdog expects to have a team of 70 to 100 staff on the investigation. Fresh inquests into the deaths of the 96 victims are set to begin by the end of March next year at an as yet undecided venue in the north west of England. Last December, verdicts of accidental death from the original inquest in March 1991 were quashed. The action was taken after the Hillsborough Independent Panel studied thousands of documents and reported there had been a huge cover-up of what happened at Hillsborough and its aftermath.

A section of the fuselage of Asiana Flight-214 is seen being removed at San Francisco airport early Friday morning . Calls to airport and fire officials to determine the cause of the smoke were not immediately returned. Airport officials hope to re-open the runway by Sunday. The closure has led to flight cancellations and delays. Meanwhile, nearly a week after Asiana . Flight 214 collided with the rocky seawall just short of its intended . airport runway, details of the crash that killed two people have . emerged, citing airspeed as a major contributor. 'The first thing that's taught to a . pilot is to look at the airspeed indicator. It is the most important . instrument in the cockpit,' said Lee Collins, a pilot with 29 years and . 18,000 hours experience flying a variety of airliners. 'Airspeed is everything.

Investigators are still trying to nail down hundreds of details about the crash last Saturday that killed two people (aircraft seen being hauled to a hanger) Investigators . are still trying to nail down hundreds of details about the crash last . Saturday that killed two people and injured dozens. NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman has cautioned against reaching conclusions. But . investigators already know a great deal. They've listened to the Boeing . 777's voice recorder, which captured the last two hours of conversation . in the cockpit. They've downloaded its flight data . recorder, which captured 1,400 indicators of what was happening on the . plane, from the temperatures inside and out to the positions of cockpit . instruments. The flight's four pilots have been interviewed, as have passengers and dozens of witnesses. Air traffic control recordings and video of the flight's last moments, including the crash itself, have been examined. Here's . what investigators have revealed about a Seoul-to-San Francisco flight . that was normal until its last minutes, when the wide-body jet carrying . 307 people rapidly lost altitude: . The . pilot flying the plane, Lee Gang-kuk, 46, had nearly 10,000 hours of . flying experience, but just 35 hours flying a Boeing 777. Asiana flight 214 is dismantled and hauled to a hangar after it was revealed that the pilots were flying the aircraft too slow at the time of landing . Workers began clearing the wreckage early Friday morning - nearly a week after the runway crash in San Francisco . He . had recently completed training that qualified him to fly passengers in . the 777, and was about halfway through his post-qualification training. He was seated in the . left cockpit pilot seat. In the co-pilot position was Lee Jeong-Min, an . experienced captain who was supervising Lee Gang-kuk's training. It was Lee Gang-kuk's first time landing a 777 in San Francisco. At 11:19:23 PDT, after a nearly . 11-hour flight, the plane was traveling over the San Francisco . Peninsula. The weather was near perfect, sunny with light winds. Lee . Jeong-Min and a third pilot sitting in a jump seat just behind the main . seats, a first officer, were supposed to be monitoring the plane's . controls. One of their most important jobs was to closely monitor the plane's two airspeed indicators. In . the U.S., if an amber bar is more than five knots above or below the . target speed during landing, the pilot flying is supposed to abort and . make another attempt, according to pilots interviewed by The Associated . Press. As the plane descended to 1,600 feet, the autopilot was turned off. At 1,400 feet, the plane's airspeed was about 170 knots. The . flight data recorder shows the plane's autothrottle — similar to a . car's cruise control — was set on idle during the approach, Hersman . said, and that there were multiple commands at times given to the . autothrottle and autopilot. At 11:26:58 and 1,000 feet, the pilots made contact with the airport tower. When they were cleared to land 12 seconds later, the plane's altitude had dropped to about 600 feet. The . plane was configured for its approach and the landing gear was down. The airspeed was about 149 knots. A target speed of 137 knots was set. Heavy equipment sits next to the wreckage of Asiana Airlines flight 214 at San Francisco International Airport days after the crash . NTSB workers seen near the Boeing 777 Asiana Airlines Flight 214 aircraft just one day after the crash in San Fransisco . At 500 feet there was an audible . automated altitude alert. The airspeed was about 134 knots. At this . point that pilots realized they weren't properly lined up with the . runway, Hersman said. 'Between 500 and 200 feet, they had a lateral deviation and they were low. They were trying to correct at that point,' she said. At 200 feet and another automated altitude call out, the airspeed had slowed to 118 knots — well below the target level. At . this point, U.S. pilots would typically call for an aborted landing . because the plane was more than 5 knots below its target speed, Collins . said. But at no point . in between 500 and 100 feet does the voice recorder show the pilots . making any comment related to airspeed, Hersman said at a briefing . Thursday. Hersman . said at earlier briefings that it was not until 200 feet — 16 seconds . before impact — that Lee Jeong-Min, the instructor pilot 'recognized the . auto-throttles were not maintaining speed.' At . 125 feet and 112 knots, both throttles started moving forward, . indicating more fuel was being sent to the engines to increase power and . speed. That was eight seconds before impact. Even . if the autothrottles weren't fully turned on, either of the pilots in . the two front seats could reach down and manually push the throttle . levers forward to increase power. Passengers from Asiana Airlines flight 214 are treated by first responders on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at the San Francisco International Airport . It was about this time that the cockpit voice recorder indicated the first officer — the third pilot seating behind the front two pilots — realized the plane was traveling too slowly and called for an increase in speed. A second later, Lee Gang-kuk's yoke can be heard rattling violently on the voice recorder. This is the sound of a stick shaker going off, a piece of safety equipment that tells a pilot the plane is about to stall because it has slowed to a dangerous speed and lost lift. When the pilots in the two front seats realized the plane was in trouble, they both reached for the throttle. Passengers heard a loud roar as the plane revved up in a last-minute attempt to abort the landing. At three seconds before impact, the plane reached its slowest speed of 103 knots. Its engines were at 50 percent power and power was increasing. At this time, one of the pilots called for an aborted landing. At one and a half seconds before impact, another of the pilots calls for an aborted landing. At 11:28, with the airspeed up three knots, the landing gear, followed by the plane's tail, collided with the seawall just short of Runway 28 Left. The plane careened wildly before slamming down onto the tarmac and sliding about 1,000 feet. The tail was sheared off and three flight attendants seated in the back of the plane fell out. Rocks from the seawall and pieces of the mangled landing gear were strewn along the runway. The NTSB's investigation is being followed closely by pilots in the U.S. and around the world. At one gathering of pilots in Dallas Wednesday night, the discussion centered on why the Asiana pilots didn't realize their low speed sooner. No one had an answer. 'There are a lot of very experienced airline pilots who are scratching their heads right now,' Collins said.","Smoke came from the aircraft's main body after crews used a sling to lift the fuselage .

More than 3,000 couples' weddings were ruined in the last 12 months by shoddy services offered by dishonest or greedy people causing grief and misery on what should be the happiest day of their lives. Their big days have been ruined by dead flowers being passed off as 'bronze', venues that are not ready or not built, prices leaping higher than quoted, and phoney photographers spoiling any chance of a happy memory. But unbeknown to many distraught wedding couples who have been taken for a ride, they have more rights to demand refunds and cancellations than they perhaps first thought. Phoney photographers, taking shots like this mocked image, have been blamed for ruining what should be couples' best days of their lives . With the average price of a wedding coming in at steep £20,000, it's no wonder complaints about disasters are so commonly reported to the Citizen's Advice Bureau. More than 3,000 wedding problem inquiries were reported by distraught couples in England and Wales between April 2012 and March 2013. Among the complaints, one furious bride had her celebrations cut short and spent her wedding night sleeping in a nearby Chinese restaurant after police evacuated the venue. The hotel had put everyone at serious risk by illegally reconnecting the energy supply after being cut off a week earlier due to an unpaid bill, leaving guests with nowhere to sleep. Unsafe venues: Some weddings have been ruined by unsuitable or unsafe venues, but maybe not as bad as Miss Ena Squire-Brown, an international dancer pictured, who's home was bombed shortly before her big day in London, 1940 . Unhappy couples made complaints about dead flowers and dry-cleaners ruining wedding dresses, but perhaps worst of all was an unsafe venue closed by police leaving guests and the couple with nowhere to stay . The botched connection could have electrocuted someone, caused a fire or even an explosion. Another bride found her blooms to be less than beautiful as the florist tried to pass dead flowers off as ‘bronze’ roses that were meant to look old, although later admitted ‘they were not the best.’ Get . agreements down on paper: Get what has been agreed written down and . signed by yourself and the trader. This includes details of the service, . price, delivery timings and cancellation details. Check . cancellation terms: Make sure you understand what your rights are if . you have to cancel or if the trader cancels your order, including how . much notice and what happens to deposits and repayment plans. Act . quickly: If something has gone wrong, like the flowers aren’t up to . scratch, speak to the seller straight away in order to get a full refund . or replacement. Gather . evidence: Take photos for proof. For example if you’re rings are being . resized, take photos in front of the trader before the work is done and . get shots of different angles of the rings. Then if anything is . different you’ll have proof. Extra . protection: If you pay by credit or debit card you might be able to get . money back from your card provider if you are having difficulties . sorting out a problem with the seller.    Insurance: . You can get specific wedding insurance to help your day run smoothly . but it’s important to make sure the policy covers your needs. Protection . from paying by credit or debit card or taking out wedding insurance . gives you the added comfort of knowing that if there is a problem that . you can't get sorted out, the Financial Ombudsman Service are likely to . be able to help you. Some of the more common ones include wedding dress issues, such as faulty dresses, unable to cancel an order despite prior agreement and dry cleaning that makes dresses dirty. Service providers, such as florists, car hire and venues, hiking prices up higher than advertised infuritates couples. Venues in particular have been a source of many complaints, with some going bust, others double booking couples and some even not having been fully built. There are also problems with rings, coming back different shapes and colours after being resized or cleaned, and issues with fake photographers ruining any hope of lasting book of happy memories. The CAB said couples were confused about their cancellation rights and whether they could getting deposits back. Brides and grooms could find it easier to challenge shoddy services in the future under proposals as part of the new Consumer Bill of Rights. The Bill is looking to introduce new rules which mean consumers can get an refund if services – like photography – aren’t carried out with reasonable skill and care. CAB Chief Executive Gillian Guy said: 'People are spending tens of thousands of pounds on what should be the best day of their lives, only to find that it comes with heartbreaking problems. 'While it’s not very romantic to think about what might go wrong, we hear from thousands of people whose big day was devastated by hitches so it pays to take a practical approach when planning. 'There are steps you can take to protect yourself from wedding problems, like getting everything down on paper which is signed by yourself and the trader, that way you have evidence of the price and service agreed.'","Complaints include ruined dresses, phoney photographers and costs soaring higher than advertised .

Oakland police have arrested the father of a missing 21-month-old girl on suspicion of endangering the girl's life by leaving her in a parked car with his mother, who suffers from dementia, while he ran to the store. John Webb, 49, was jailed on $100,000 bond and was scheduled for arraignment Friday in connection with the disappearance of his 21-month-old daughter, Daphne Viola Webb, authorities said. Webb told investigators he left his disabled mother and his daughter in his black Ford SUV while he dashed into Gazzali's Supermarket at 7838 International Boulevard in East Oakland for an energy drink at about 11am Wednesday, police spokeswoman Johnna Watson said. Father and daughter: John Webb (left), 49, was arrested for child endangerment after police say he left his 21-month-old daughter (right) in a parked car with a disabled grandmother when the toddler was kidnapped . Snatched: Witnesses reported seeing a woman carrying Daphne away from her father's black Ford SUV in Oakland . When Webb returned to his vehicle, he told police, the girl had vanished. Watson said at least one witness reported seeing an unidentified woman between the ages of 30 and 40 carrying Daphne away. Webb was not considered a suspect in the abduction, Watson said. But she added that he was arrested because he left a 21-month-old girl in the care of her mentally disabled 87-year-old grandmother. The father reported little Daphne missing at 11.09am. The California Highway Patrol issued an Amber Alert for the child and dispatched officers to scour East Oakland. Police and FBI agents have spent the past three days searching for the toddler, who weighs about 30lbs and was last seen wearing an orange, two-piece pajama set with pink hearts, and pink socks, authorities said. Authorities asked that anyone who had seen the father and daughter together in the days or hours before the incident contact investigators, and officers searched a shoreline park often frequented by Webb and the girl. Pit stop: Mr Webb told police that he ran into Gazzali's Supermarket on International Boulevard to get an energy drink, and when he returned, his daughter was gone . Seeking Daphne: The toddler, who weighs about 30lbs, was last seen wearing an orange, two-piece pajama set with pink hearts, and pink socks . On Friday, police expanded the search for the toddler to the Oakland shoreline and the Oak Knoll neighborhood where the Webbs live, Oakland Tribune reported. Authorities scoured the area by air using a police helicopter and by land with the help of motorcycles, which fanned out across local parks where the 49-year-old father would often take Daphne. On Thursday afternoon, police cordoned off a parking lot at the Martin Luther King Jr. Regional Shoreline, not far from Oakland International Airport. Four-legged help: Police had searched Webb's Oakland home with dogs and also used K-9 units to scour local parks . Sea search: Police used a boat equipped with sonar and an underwater camera to scour the Oakland shorline . Members of the Alameda County . Sheriff's Search and Rescue team combed the area with at least two K-9 . dogs and a number of boats that scanned the water.

Schools are boosting GCSE results by forcing children to sit the same exam as many as seven times, a government investigation has found. Growing numbers of schools are entering pupils for a series of different tests in English and maths but only recording their best score so as to hike their positions in league tables. In many cases, children are taking exams up to two years early and then sitting them again after failing to get good scores at the first attempt. Schools are trying to manipulate exam performance tables by making pupils sit the same exams up to seven times, a Department for Education investigation has revealed (file picture) But the Department for Education found some schools are going to even more extreme measures to improve their performance, including allowing children to sit the same subject with different examination boards in the same year to maximise their chances of doing well. It has also emerged the number of pupils sitting both GCSEs and International GCSEs - and alternative version of the qualification designed for schools overseas - has risen 10-fold in 12 months, with 5,700 pupils taking maths in both versions in 2012 - up from 600 the previous year. The DfE warned 'continually sitting examinations' was harmful to children's education. It also emerged 400 pupils took maths exams at least seven times in 2012, a fourfold rise in 12 months. The DfE has pledged to halt the process by reforming school league tables and moving towards end-of-course exams. A spokesman said in the Daily Telegraph: 'We are increasingly concerned about this. Education secretary Michael Gove has demanded a clampdown on the practice . 'The evidence shows entering exams early, and then resitting, or sitting another exam in the same subject, is not good for pupils. 'The changes we have made to GCSEs and reforms to the accountability system will help address this. We are considering further action to discourage this practice.' The cross-party Commons education committee published a report last year that criticised the extent to which the exams system skewed pupils' education. As part of the report, MPs asked the DfE to investigate the problem of multiple exam entry and what action was needed to limit the practice. This week, officials published new research into the issue. Seven per cent of pupils sat GCSEs in English more than once in 2012, down from 25 per cent a year earlier. In maths, the numbers were as high as 41 per cent, compared with 28 per cent the previous year. Some 4,500 pupils sat maths exams five times in 2012, up from 800 in 2011. A further 400 took exams in the subject at least seven times, a significant increase on the 100 pupils doing so a year before. The DfE report stated many cases involved children who took 'different specifications' - test papers in the same subject drawn up by different exam boards. It added: 'Of the 63,800 pupils who took maths three times in 2012, 50,000 - 78 per cent - included more than one specification in their entries. 'The use of multiple specifications in mathematics in 2012 represented a significant increase when compared to 2011 (when it accounted for only 14 per cent).'","Fourfold rise in number of pupils taking same exam multiple times .

The number of whistleblowers exposing bad practice in the NHS and care for the elderly has more than doubled in a year, according to a report. Last year, 8,634 people got in touch with the Care Quality Commission, the equivalent of 24 calls a day – raising concerns that not all reports are being listened to because the regulator is under such pressure.

The Care Quality Commission was forced to apologise after senior managers were accused of suppressing a report into maternity services at Furness general hospital . A whistleblower had raised concerns but claimed they were ignored. Most of the calls (7,456) related to poor standards in social care – from residential care homes to home helps. Some 601 related to NHS trusts, while 309 were about private health providers. Some 122 cases referred to dentists, 116 to ambulance trusts and 19 to GP surgeries and other primary care services. The huge rise in calls also follows high-profile scandals such as Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, where up to 1,200 died unnecessarily . The report said the CQC had improved its whistleblowing procedures by setting up a team of 46 staff to ensure that all cases are processed efficiently. But the huge rise in calls also follows high-profile scandals such as Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, where up to 1,200 died unnecessarily. However, It is not known whether the increase is down to the greater willingness of whistleblowers to come forward, or whether the number of cases is on the up. Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents, said: ‘The acid test will be what the CQC does about the information on cases provided to it.’ Dementia patients are not being tested properly in hospital, according to the latest National Dementia Audit. Tests for delirium and mental state are at an ‘alarmingly low’ level, meaning patients could be staying in hospital for longer than necessary, the Royal College of Psychiatrists said. The report also found that two in five hospitals did not provide dementia awareness training to new staff, while 11 per cent did not provide such training to nurses.","Last year 8,634 people contacted the Care Quality Commission - the equivalent of 24 calls a day .

A man who claimed stealing $140,000 from a bank was justified because he gave the money to the homeless has been jailed for nearly six years. U.S. District Judge Alan B. Johnson sentenced Corey Donaldson, 40, to serve 70 months for the Jackson bank robbery. The federal judge in Wyoming also said Donaldson likely will be deported back to Australia after his prison term. Jailed: Corey Donaldson, 40, claimed stealing $140,000 from a bank was justified because he gave the money to the homeless - he has now been jailed for nearly six years . Representing himself at trial this spring, Donaldson likened himself to Robin Hood, saying he was justified in taking over $140,000 from the U.S. Bank on Dec. 31 because he used much of the cash to save the lives of homeless people. 'You haven't lived until you have served others in such a way that they can never pay you back,' Donaldson told the judge on Thursday. He also apologized for terrifying the bank manager by falsely claiming the bank building was rigged with explosives. Donaldson was arrested on Jan. 22 in Utah. Officers recovered more than $30,000 from Donaldson and in a room he had rented in an upscale hotel. At trial, officers testified they found $11,000 stuffed into envelopes and addressed to Donaldson's relatives. Donaldson addressed the judge for more than an hour Thursday, spanning subjects ranging from a family yachting accident when he was a teenager to his plans to study literature after prison. He said he came to the U.S. after marrying a U.S. citizen and stayed, sometimes without a home, after a divorce. Justification: Representing himself at trial this spring, Donaldson said he was justified in taking over $140,000 from the U.S. Bank on Dec. 31 because he used much of the cash to save the lives of homeless people . Donaldson argued that banks racked up record profits while forcing people into homelessness through foreclosures. He said his father lost the family home in Australia in a bank default years ago and once considered suicide as a means of providing for 10 children from life insurance proceeds. Prosecutor Todd Shugart emphasized that Donaldson was prepared to ship money to family overseas. 'His claim of carrying out this act to benefit the poor is simply disingenuous,' Shugart said. In pronouncing sentence, Johnson said the bank robbery was 'fueled by deceit.' He cited a pre-sentencing report that stated that Donaldson had written to publishers trying to drum up interest in a book about the robbery. Johnson said he expects Donaldson will be deported back to Australia after serving his sentence. 'I don't view what will happen to him as an exile in this matter, but a return home,' the judge said.","Corey Donaldson, 40, to serve 70 months for the Jackson bank robbery .

It sounds like the perfect health food, it's free, and there is literally thousands of tonnes of it. But would you tuck into a sloppy bowel of fluorescent green algae soup, verdant algae pancakes, or a bar snack of fried algae and nuts? Abundance: The seas off China's Qingdao, may look infested to some, but to one clever chef, it's a vision of free food . It might not be our cup of tea, but in Qingdao, in China's eastern Shandong province, where the beach has been swamped with one of the largest recorded annual blooms of the stuff, it simply makes sense to eat it. The algae growth this year has covered a 29,000sq km area and is blamed for starving marine life of oxygen. The scale of the spread has been blamed on warm seas, but many scientists point the finger at pollution for the phenomenon. Some experts say that the algae blooms in water with high levels of nutrients, blaming farmers using too much fertiliser on their crops and cities falling to treat sewage properly. Health benefits: Residents haven't been deterred from bathing and playing in the weed; now they can eat it too . This year the non-toxic algae bloom is worse than the 2008 growth which had to be cleaned up before the Olympic Games . It appears some local residents are also collecting the green sludge, perhaps to try cooking it themselves . It is twice as vast as the giant green bloom that was cleaned up before China hosted the 2008 Olympics. While it hasn't deterred residents from taking a dip in the green syrupy waters, believing it to be good for them, officials are eager to get the weed cleaned up before it begins to rot. This form of algae, a non poisonous sea lettuce known as Enteromorpha prolifera, can produce large quantities of hydrogen sulphide, a toxic gas, when it decomposes. But while it is fresh, chef Ma Hui, who manages Liangchu Feichanghao (Brilliant Kitchen) restaurant in Qingdao, is seeing the green infestation as an opportunity. He told The Times: 'We felt that the algae was so green that it probably didn't have any bacteria in it, so we gathered some up and experimented with a few recipes. Successfully it turns out.' Local residents have heard about his offerings and have been showing up in droves to give it a try. On the menu is algae and duck soup, with eggs to offset the bitter taste, steamed green algae  pancakes, which have proven to be a winner at lunch, and a cold dish of algae and nuts - a steal at just £1 a plate. 'It tastes a bit like kelp and we find that our customers are very curious to know what all our algae tastes like. They hear about our recipes and then feel like they have to come here and try it personally,' he said. With such curious appeal, it appears other restaurants are now also taking note and looking at ways to make a return on this free ingredient. Perhaps it could become an annual delicacy in this part of eastern China.","Non-toxic algae has covered a 29,000sq km of Qingdao's beach in China .

An Oklahoma man was arrested after being found in a septic tank in a park outhouse.Kenneth Enslow, 52, was discovered by a 7-year-old girl and her mother at about 5pm Sunday when the two went to use the bathroom at a park near Tulsa, OK, heard coughing and saw him looking up at them, according to officials.The two fled the bathroom and called the authorities, who ended up having to fish the peeping Tom out. Disgusting: Kenneth Enslow, 52, was discovered inside a Tulsa, OK park toilet looking up at unsuspecting park goers while they did their business . By the time officials arrived, Enslow was ‘standing with his head and shoulders out of the hole… covered in feces,’ according to an arrest report filed by the Tulsa County Sheriff’s office.The fire department helped the unemployed degenerate out of the cesspool using rope and hosed him off, literally, with the fire hose, the report said.‘They extracted him with rope and sprayed him off with the hose on the fire truck,’ Stuart Meyer told KOTV, ‘he was covered in defecation and looked like he had been down there for quite some time.’ Enslow first claimed that he was hit over the head with a tire iron, tossed in the back of a 1972 Chevrolet Monte Carlo and dumped there by his girlfriend Angel, according to the report. Enslow claimed he did not ask for help because he was unconscious. After being taken to a local hospital as a precaution, even after officers failed to find injuries consistent with assault from a tire iron, the pervert later admitted he made the story up, according to KJRH. Tempting: Enslow couldn't resist the urge to hop into the septic tank below the outhouse in a Tulsa park . Relaxing: The park is a haven for locals looking to fish and hike, not to be fished out of the latrine . Explaining that Enslow is not a small man, Meyer said that Enslow ‘had to work to get into that hole… there were claims he was put in that hole by somebody else, I don’t think that happened.’The arresting officer did observe ‘several scratches on [Enslow’s] head, but they were old and had scabbed over,’ the report states. The deviant also had scratches on his arms ‘from the rough edges of the concrete slab.’ White Water Park is a lake situated on a dam just west of Tulsa, OK. It is a popular local fishing and hiking area.Enslow was taken from the hospital to a local jail and charged with being a Peeping Tom, a misdemeanour, a Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson told Mail Online. He is also being held on warrants dating back to 1998 for embezzlement and illegal dumping in Okmulgee County, a spokesperson from that county’s sheriff’s office told Mail Online. Peaceful: The park usually offers residents a respite from the stresses of everyday life . This is not Enslow's first run-in with the fuzz, he has also been arrested for public intoxication and driving under suspension, arrest records show, according to KOTV.Despite the septic swimmer being locked up for now, Meyer isn’t taking any chances.‘To think that there’s somebody down in the bottom watching you is plumb scary,’ Meyer told KOTV, ‘we’ll take a flashlight and look below first, I don’t want to see anybody scuba diving in the toilet.’","The 52-year-old man claimed he was dumped there by a girlfriend named Angel after she hit him over the head with a tire iron and took him to the park in a 1972 Chevy Monte Carlo .

"By . Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 23:51 EST, 11 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:00 EST, 12 July 2013 . New York City Police are being warned against proactively policing in response to anti-discrimination legislation passed recently by the city legislature.The city council last month passed two bills that will make it easier to sue the NYPD for racial profiling, and did so with a veto-proof majority. In response, cops are being told to only answer radio calls and respond to crimes they see taking place – a big change from the proactive policing started in the 1990s under then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.The first bill, which creates an inspector general to oversee the department, passed 40-11, according to reports. The second bill, which allows people to sue for racial profiling, passed 34-17. The bills garnered the votes needed to override any mayoral veto. Handcuffed: The NYPD's ability to proactively police is severely limited by new legislation aimed at cracking down on discrimination, the department claims . The NYPD Patrolman’s Benevolent Association this week sent a letter warning cops to no longer react to ‘events not occurring in the officer’s presence… [which could] subject the officer to legal action,’ according to a copy of the letter obtained by Mail Online.A veteran officer with more than a decade on the force who spoke to Mail Online said this severely handicaps the department’s ability to protect citizens and turns them from a proactive police force into a reactive force answering radio calls. Giving the example of an incident involving a black male in his 20s, wearing a white t-shirt, jeans and a Yankees hat, the officer said he can only get on the radio and say ‘suspect is a male wearing a Yankees hat, jeans and a white t-shirt.’ Mentioning a suspect's race could expose the officer to a discrimination lawsuit in a department that won't indemnify officers against infractions as minor as parking tickets, the officer says, asking 'why should I believe they;ll have my back?'Taking it a step further, the officer said that quality of life crimes like drug dealing, people walking around with weapons, and other similar offenses will go largely unpoliced for fear of legal action being taken against an officer. ‘In order to live safely, you have to be willing to give up some of your privacy,’ the officer said. Let it burn: A veteran NYPD officer said that the new legislation will make it virtually impossible to stop quality of life crimes in the city . Not only will it cripple any ability police have to proactively thwart crime, it will also lead to a wave of lawsuits brought against the department by clever kids out for a buck, according to the officer.‘If someone comes up to me and says so and so on the corner has a gun and I go check and he doesn’t have one, I could be sued,’ the officer said, later adding 'as far as we’re concerned, let the city burn.’Stop and frisks are an important part of police work, said the officer, explaining that even if only one in 10 searches turns up a gun, there’s no telling how many lives that may save, ‘even most minorities you talk to aren’t against it.’ The officer is a minority himself. Not good: NYPD officers argue that recently passed legislation will cause crime to go back to levels not seen since the 80s . In defending the legislation prior to its passage, city councilman Jumaane Williams – the bills’ sponsor – said ‘there have been a lot of bald-faced lies told about this bill,’ according to the New York Daily News.‘We can have safety and can have police accountability at the exact same time,’ Williams argued.A number of prominent politicians and officials disagreed. No more: City Councilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn) says that his constituents no longer need to live in fear of NYPD discrimination . The bills ‘would seriously impede the ability of the Police Department and the City to protect 8.4 million New Yorkers” inviting  “avalanche of new lawsuits against police action,’ Michael Best, counsel to Mayor Michael Bloomberg write in a letter to the city council.‘It will achieve the ultimate goal of this bill, to put judges in charge of the NYPD… Crime will soar, murder will rise, children will die,’ councilman Peter Vallone told the Daily News. ‘Crime is going to go back to 80s levels, which is what it will take for people to learn their lesson,’ said the officer. Mail Online was unable to reach the PBA, Best, Villone or Williams for comment. The NYPD did not respond to a message left for comment. Stop: This NYPD PBA letter advises all officers to police on a reactive basis, rather than a proactive basis - unless a crime is being witnessed .","The Patrolman's Benevolent Association has warned all officers against acting unless a crime is visibly in progress .

The head of Homeland Security has told her staff that she will be leaving her post in order to become the president of the University of California school system. Janet Napolitano reportedly told her staff about her decision to leave the Cabinet Friday morning, though it is not clear when exactly she would head to California from D.C. The move from the Cabinet to the classroom comes as a slightly unexpected one, though it may show that she is broadening her national recognition in preparation for a future White House bid. In addition to raising her profile, the move will inevitably lead to a massive pay raise: as a Cabinet Secretary, she has earned $200,000 per year, and while her new salary has not been released, the outgoing UC president made nearly three times as much, taking home $591,000 per year. Leaving: Janet Napolitano announced to her staff that she will be stepping down as Secretary of Homeland Security to head the University of California school system . The 55-year-old was born in New York . but spent much of her life in the southwest, having attended high school . in New Mexico, college at the University of California-Santa Clara, and . going on to practice law in Phoenix, Arizona. Her new appointment is ground-breaking as she will be the first woman to run the state's 10-school system, but this is not the first time that she has broken the glass ceiling. Emergency response: Much of Napolitano's time as head of Homeland Security has been spent dealing with natural disasters like the tornado in Moore, Oklahoma (pictured in May) Before becoming the first woman to be the Secretary of Homeland Security when she came into office with President Obama in 2009, she was the first female governor of Arizona to win re-election. (She was the state's third female governor.) Her time running a large federal agency- notorious for excessive bureaucratic red tape- is seen as one of her biggest assets. 'While some may consider her to be an unconventional choice, Secretary Napolitano is without a doubt the right person at the right time to lead this incredible university,' said Sherry Lansing who led the search committee. 'She will bring fresh eyes and a new sensibility -- not only to UC, but to all of California,' Lansing said to the Los Angeles Times. 'She will stand as a vigorous advocate for faculty, students and staff at a time when great changes in our state, and across the globe, are presenting as many opportunities as challenges.' President Obama released a statement just as the news broke, thanking Napolitano for her 'around the clock' work responding to natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the tornado in Joplin, Missouri. 'I’ve come to rely on Janet’s judgment and advice, but I’ve also come to value her friendship,' he said in the statement. One of her biggest gaffes while Secretary . came after the attempted terrorist attack on an airplane on Christmas . Day in 2009. Following the thwarted bombing, Napolitano said that 'the . system worked' in an interview, but later clarified her remarks after . the ensuing uproar. Powerful position: Napolitano, seen sitting between President Obama and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in October, has worked for the Obama administration for the past four years . Through the years: Prior to being appointed to the Cabinet position, she worked as the Arizona Attorney General (left, in 1999) and the state's governor (right, in 2004) 'As she begins a new chapter in a remarkable career of public service, I wish her the best of luck,' the President said in the statement. For her part, Napolitano released a statement saying that she wanted to take the new job so that she could 'play a role in educating our nation's next generation of leaders'. 'I thank President Obama for the chance to serve our nation during this important chapter in our history, and I know the Department of Homeland Security will continue to perform its important duties with the honor and focus that the American public expects.' During the 2008 campaign when then-Senator Hillary Clinton was battling it out with Barack Obama to take the Democratic nomination for president, Napolitano was listed by The New York Times as a possible future female candidate. Six years as the Democratic governor of a typically Republican state and four years as one of the country's top security agencies makes the prospect of a presidential bid seem within the realm of possibility. California dreaming: Both Napolitano and her father attended UC-Santa Clara for their undergraduate degrees . In the past, her political opponents have started 'whisper' campaigns against her, hinting that the  never-married, childless 55-year-old is gay though she has always adamantly denied the claims. She previously responded that she is 'just a straight, single workaholic'. The timing of her departure, however, comes as a surprise to many as the debate over immigration is in the nascent stages. Her voice as head of the Department of Homeland Security- which manages the country's borders- would have been an important one to consider during talk of implementation of any new policies. That said, she will not leave her Cabinet post until mid-September, meaning that she will still be weighing in on the proposed immigration changes.","Became Cabinet Secretary in 2009 when Obama took office .

The future of the head of the civil service looked bleak last night after he was given only lukewarm  support by No 10. David Cameron’s official spokesman denied rumours that the Prime Minister was trying to force Sir Bob Kerslake out over the slow pace of Whitehall reform. He added: ‘The Prime Minister fully supports the work that Bob Kerslake is doing.’ Representatives of Number 10 have been forced to deny rumours that David Cameron is trying to force Sir Bob Kerslake out over the slow pace of Whitehall reform . But another Downing Street source said he was only safe ‘for now’ – a sign that his days are numbered following his failure to modernise the outdated civil service. It has been reported that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has been asked by Mr Cameron to draw up a shortlist of possible successors. A progress report on the Government’s civil service reform plan this week found that only seven out of 18 targets had been met since it was launched last year. This is thought to have angered Mr Cameron, who believes the civil service is a roadblock to reform. A spokesperson said Cameron 'fully supports Sir Robert, while another Downing Street source said the top mandarin was only safe ¿for now¿ . Sir Bob’s detractors are said to call him ‘Bungalow Bob’, because they claim he has little ‘up top’. Sir Bob is known to have links to the leadership training firm Common Purpose, a sort of old boys’ network for the Left. Founded in 1989, it uses taxpayer cash to run courses for civil servants. Many of its 35,000 ‘graduates’ hold top public-sector jobs. Sir Bob used Common Purpose as head of Sheffield Council, and writes on the firm’s website: ‘I have been involved with Common Purpose over a number of years.’ Its founder, Julia Middleton, launched the Media Standards Trust with Common Purpose’s ex-chairman Sir David Bell, who worked on the Leveson Inquiry. The trust presented evidence to Lord Justice Leveson and spawned the Hacked Off pressure group. But others say he is simply overworked, having been given two jobs; head of the civil service and permanent secretary of the Department for Communities and Local Government. A spokesman for the Institute for Government think-tank said the blame could not be pinned on Sir Bob, adding: ‘To make this ambitious reform plan succeed will take more than the efforts of one or even a few at the top of Whitehall. ‘It will require a team of top civil servants and senior ministers.’ Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said this week he was unimpressed with the progress of reform. Four targets have been significantly delayed, including sharing expert services across Government, establishing a plan to fill Whitehall’s skills gaps, increasing secondments from the private sector, and creating a modern workplace with effective IT. Yesterday, he said: ‘We would all say we are not happy with the progress. There is progress we are proud of on some things. 'On others, we didn’t put in place early enough the right resources and the right leadership.’","No 10 denies David Cameron wants to oust Sir Robert Kerslake .

An explosion inside a New York Chinatown building caused by a woman who set off 24 bug bombs at once led to a fire and the partial collapse of the building. According to firefighters, the woman had let off 20 canisters of bug bombs on Wednesday and on Thursday deployed two dozen more - only this time she forgot to turn off an oven's pilot light. The flame ignited the huge cloud of flammable insecticide causing a fire that ripped through the building and injured a 15 people, including four firefighters. Disaster: Water sprays out through a window as firefighters get the fire in the stricken building under control . The five-storey building was already under investigation for as a fire hazard. According to the New York Daily News, in 2009, building inspectors found that the first floor was 'sinking in middle of building,' with rotting floor joists and no fire stop material in the cellar. Resident Jinjoo Yang, who lives next door, said, 'I heard a big sound. It sounded like something big fell from the next floor. I felt the whole floor shaking.' Hazard: Firefighters remove debris from the back of the building in the aftermath of the fire on Thursday . She said gray smoke that smelt like gas had seeped into her apartment. Three of those injured were hospitalized in serious condition. Injuries to the other people, including the four firefighters, were less severe and included burns. One unconscious victim had to be taken out of a third-floor window, and according to the New York Daily News, one brave firefighter was administering oxygen to the victim before they'd even reached the ground. The New York Daily News reported that the . insecticide fire originated in the rear of the first-floor at 17 Pike .

The American Red Cross said it provided . emergency housing for 28 adults and three children left homeless after a . vacate order was issued for the building. Bug bombs are also known as foggers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued new warning labels last year reminding people to not use more than one in a room at a time and to turn off all electronic appliances and pilot lights because the pesticides are highly flammable. They cause about 500 explosions annually nationwide. It's not known exactly how many cockroaches were plaguing the woman to prompt her to set off so many.","A woman let off 24 bug bombs at once in a Manhattan building .

A drug dealer who refused to pay James 'Whitey' Bulger a $100,000 tribute says he changed his mind after his 17-year-old brother was shot and Bulger told him: 'You're next.' The testimony about threats, shootings and Bulger's grip on the South Boston narcotics trade wrapped up the fifth week of the former mob boss's murder and racketeering trial in his old hometown. James 'Whitey' Bulger: He was one of the nation's most wanted fugitives after he fled Boston in 1994. He was finally captured two years ago in Santa Monica, California and faces 32 counts, including 19 murder charges . Bulger, accused of murdering or ordering the killing of 19 people in the 1970s and 1980s while he ran South Boston's feared 'Winter Hill' gang, demanded payment from drug dealers and imposed rules on their business, the witnesses said. Anthony Attardo, 55, told jurors he . had been dealing cocaine in South Boston for six years when members of . Bulger's gang approached him in 1985, asking him to buy cocaine from . them. When he refused, they demanded a cut of $100,000 he said. Attardo, a former boxer, said he tried to deceive Bulger, saying he had gotten out of the drug trade. 'He . said, 'Don't lie to me. The money's so good the only time you're going . to quit is when you go to jail,'' Attardo recalled. 'And he was right . about that.' Not wanting to pay the feared mobster, Attardo tried to avoid him, until his 17-year-old brother was shot. 'Mr. Bulger said to me, 'You're next . if I don't get my money.' And I said, 'I'll meet you down at the liquor . store,'' Attardo said. 'I grew up in Southie all my life. Everybody knew . his reputation. Very dangerous, he meant what he said.' Bulger, . who faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted on charges . that include racketeering and drug dealing, has pleaded not guilty. His . lead attorney, J.W. Carney of the Boston law firm Carney & Bassil, . admitted in opening statements that Bulger was an extortionist, loan . shark and drug dealer and earlier this week described Bulger as an . 'organized criminal.' Jury heard from alleged victims: Steve Davis, brother of alleged murder victim Debra Davis, answers a reporter's question outside federal court . Emotional testimony: The jury heard from Steve Davis, the brother of Debra (pictured). She was just 26 when she was allegedly strangled by either Bulger or her then-boyfriend, Stephen Flemmi, in September 1981 . Outspoken tough guy Steve Davis broke down in tears as he testified against the man accused of murder his sister, Debra Davis. She was just 26 when she was allegedly strangled by either Bulger or her then-boyfriend, Stephen Flemmi in September 1981. Davis said he was close with his sister, and that she only had two enemies. 'Those two enemies were Steve Flemmi and Whitey Bulger, because that's why she's not here today,' he said. 'She was a beautiful young woman. She had no enemies, except for two. Everybody that met her loved her,' said Steve Davis as he choked back tears. 'She was my best friend growing up.' Prosecutors say Bulger strangled her inside a South Boston apartment after she attempted to end her relationship with Flemmi. Davis said after his sister's disappearance, Flemmi would come to his family's home and tell them he was doing everything he could to find her and urged them not to call police. Davis said he didn't believe Flemmi for a second. Davis has regularly attended the trial. Patricia Donahue also testified, detailing the last time she spoke with her husband, Michael Donahue, before he was killed on May 11, 1982. She said she didn't think anything about a 'gangland' murder being reported on the news until she saw her father-in-law's car on the television. Her husband had been driving it, and it was shown riddled with bullets. 'I had no idea where he was,' she said, describing her search for information after seeing the news. 'I called every hospital in this city, nobody would give up any information. I couldn't tell my children what was going on because I didn't know. I wanted to be with my husband. I wanted to make sure, if he was dying, that I was there with him. I didn't want him to be alone.' Bulger is accused of shooting Donahue and Brian Halloran with another shooter who has never been identified. Partners: James 'Whitey' Bulger, left, walking with his former right hand man, Kevin Weeks. Weeks took the witness stand earlier this week at Bulger's racketeering trial and described a double slaying, multiple extortions and drug dealing. Partners in crime: This week a number of former drug dealers came forward to say that that Bulger banned them from selling drugs and banned them from selling heroin and angel dust in Southie. Here James 'Whitey' Bulger (left) is shown with Kevin Weeks . Another former drug dealer who worked the neighborhood, said Bulger had imposed rules on the trade. Paul Moore, 63, who testified against Bulger in the 1990s and then went into the witness protection program, said he sold marijuana and cocaine under the protection of the 'Winter Hill' gang but that other drugs were forbidden. 'You never sold drugs to children, did you?' defense attorney Carney asked Moore, who replied, 'You'd get hurt if you did anything like that.' While Bulger's gang accepted thousands of dollars a week in tribute for his sales of cocaine and marijuana, Moore said the gang prohibited him from selling heroin and 'angel dust,' a form of marijuana laced with other drugs believed more dangerous. Bulger fled Boston after a 1994 tip from corrupt FBI agent John Connolly. He evaded arrest for 16 years before the FBI caught up with him when he was hiding in an apartment in Santa Monica, California. After Bulger fled the city, Attardo said he tried to take a page from the Winter Hill playbook when a friend told him that people who he believed to be drug dealers from the Dominican Republic were selling drugs in the neighborhood. 'I decided with him that maybe we should pull a Whitey Bulger and extort them,' Attardo said. As it turned out, the so-called drug dealers were undercover police officers. 'So that didn't work out to well for you?' Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Hafer asked Attardo. 'No, it did not,' replied Attardo, who was later sentenced to 9-1/2 years in prison for drug offenses.","Trial has now heard its fifth week of testimony .

Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen has fired her entire legal team in the ongoing fallout from the racial slurs scandal that have sunk her career. What started out as the defense of a civil lawsuit has turned into an operation to try and salvage what's left of Deen's business empire after she lost a host of major sponsors and her slot on the Food Network. According to court documents, Deen has replaced Savannah-based firm Oliver Maner with Grace Speights, a Washington, D.C.-based partner in Morgan, Lewis & Bockius' Labor and Employment practice. Grace Speights is considered something of a pioneer as the first African-American woman to become a partner at her law firm. She has also been a keynote speaker at the Attorneys of Color Conference. The hiring could be seen by a cynical move by Deen who is keen to point out she is not a racist after her recent troubles. Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen has fired her entire legal team in the ongoing fallout from the racial slurs scandal that have sunk her career . ‘She and her team decided the previous attorneys were out of their depth,’ a source close to the Deen family told People. Deen has assembled a new legal team of acclaimed 'heavy hitters' that also includes Patricia Glaser, one of the country's top entertainment lawyers, and Savannah-based Harvey Weitz. Glaser earned a reputation as a 'tough, take-no-prisoners litigator' after securing a $32.5 million payout from NBC for Conan O'Brien for the remainder of his 'The Tonight Show' contract in 2010. The new 'All Stars' legal team will be charged with defending Deen . against the lawsuit filed by Lisa Jackson, a former manager of .

She also fired her longtime agent Barry Weiner (right) What started out as the defense of a civil lawsuit has turned into an operation to try and salvage what's left of Deen's business empire after she lost a host of major sponsors and her slot on the Food Network . It was in a legal deposition connected with the case that Deen admitted under oath to having used the N-word. Since then she has suffered a dramatic fall from grace and her earnings have crumbled following the departure of major sponsors including Target and Walmart. Securing a victory in the upcoming civil action against Jackson will be imperative to rebuilding Deen's public brand. Since the scandal broke, she has been working with reputation expert Judy Smith, the inspiration behind . the Olivia Pope character in ABC's hit drama Scandal. Last week Deen split with longtime agent Barry Weiner, who had helped make her a star. Deen had worked with Weiner for more than a decade. She . has said he was instrumental in getting her show 'Paula's Home Cooking' on the . Food Network in 2002. Scene: Lisa Jackson worked at the restaurant, pictured, in Savannah, Georgia between 2005 and 2010 . 'Paula Deen has separated from her agent,' Deen's spokeswoman, Elana Weiss, . said in a prepared statement. 'She and her family thank him for the tireless effort . and dedication over the many years.' After the N-word scandal, the Food Network passed on renewing Deen's contract and yanked her shows off . the air. Smithfield Foods, the pork producer that paid Deen as a celebrity . endorser, dropped her soon after. Retailers including Walmart and Target quickly announced that they would no longer sell Deen's products and publisher Ballantine scuttled plans . for an upcoming cookbook even when it was the No. 1 seller on Amazon. Even . the diabetes drug company that made the much-criticized deal to hire Deen as a . paid spokeswoman dumped her. Weiner had worked to turn Deen into a comfort-food queen since she was little . more than a Savannah restaurant owner and self-publisher of cookbooks who earned . raves for her fried chicken. 'I is what I is, and I'm not changing,' sobbed Deen on Today, but her performance didn't impress her sponsors who left in droves . In her book 'Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cookin,' Deen recalled . meeting Weiner through TV producer Gordon Elliott, who was convinced they could . turn her into a star. 'Barry and Gordon felt like there was a show somewhere inside this Paula . character that could be very successful,' Deen wrote. 'They probably courted . Food Network for two years trying to push me at them.' Deen also noted in her book: 'Barry is affectionately known in my family as . Barry Cuda. Perfect name for an agent.' The chef's business deals began falling apart after she was questioned under oath . in May as part of a civil lawsuit filed last year by Lisa Jackson, a former . manager of Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, which Deen co-owns with her . brother, Bubba Hiers. Jackson says she was sexually harassed and worked in an . environment rife with racial slurs and innuendo. Family: Bubba, left, allegedly made repeated sexual jokes in front of co-workers . Ultimately it was Deen's own words that proved damaging. Asked in her . deposition if she had ever used the N-word, she replied: 'Yes, of course.' That . she also insisted 'it's been a very long time' seemed to matter little to the . companies paying to use her name and image with their products. Neither were . they swayed by Deen's apologies in online videos and in person with the 'Today' show's Matt Lauer. Forbes magazine last year ranked Deen as the fourth-highest-earning celebrity . chef last year, figuring she had hauled in $17 million. Her company Paula Deen . Enterprises generates total annual revenue of nearly $100 million, according to . Burt Flickinger III, president of retail consultancy Strategic Resource . Group.

A Pennsylvania couple and another woman have been charged with physically and sexually abusing four children in their care for more than two decades. Warren Earl Yerger Sr., 51, of Douglassville, faces more than 500 criminal charges in connection with the alleged crimes against three girls and a boy, including rape, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault and corruption of minors. Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan said Friday that Yerger's wife, 34-year-old Leslie Yerger, a company payroll supervisor, and one-time girlfriend 46-year-old Deborah Keeley, a secretary, also face multiple counts including sex crimes and corruption of minors. Officials say the children were as young as 3 and the abuse occurred at residences in Chester, Berks, McKean and Montgomery counties between 1989 and 2012. The three defendants were booked into the Chester County Prison. Mr Yerger, a security guard, is being held on $1million bail. A judge set bail for the two women at $500,000 each. According to allegations made public Friday, the children were subjected to anal rape and digital penetration, forced to perform sex acts on adults and each other, and also required to take part in sexual encounters between the suspects, Philly.com reported. 'This was, in every way possible, a living, walking breathing nightmare for these victims,' Chester County District Attorney Thomas Hogan told CBS Philly.

The fire which grounded a Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow Airport was not directly linked to the passenger jet's batteries, an investigation has found. Air accident experts have been in London today to try and determine the cause of the blaze which happened while the Ethiopian Airlines-operated plane was on a remote parking stand just after 4.30pm yesterday. The fire led to the airport's runways being closed for more than 90 minutes and causing travel chaos for thousands. A series of problems with batter led to all Dreamliner jets in service being grounded worldwide. Scroll down for video . On fire: The Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet caught fire near a terminal at Heathrow Airport yesterday afternoon . Nobody was on board at the time of the Heathrow incident and there were no injuries, an airport spokesman has said. The US National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a representative to London to assist authorities with their investigation into the fire. Today the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the initial investigation was likely to take several days. The aircraft is currently being examined in a hangar at Heathrow. Investigators have found 'extensive heat damage in the upper portion of the rear fuselage, a complex part of the aircraft'. The AAIB said: 'The aircraft is currently located in a hangar at London Heathrow. There has been extensive heat damage in the upper portion of the rear fuselage, a complex part of the aircraft, and the initial investigation is likely to take several days. 'However, it is clear that this heat damage is remote from the area in which the aircraft main and APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) batteries are located and at this stage there is no evidence of a direct causal relationship.' Ethiopian Airlines said the aircraft had been parked at Heathrow for more than eight hours before smoke was detected. An airline spokesman said they would continue to operate their fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Meanwhile, in a separate incident Thomson Airways said a Dreamliner flight to Florida had to be diverted back to Manchester yesterday due to a 'technical issue'. Boeing temporarily withdrew the Dreamliner from service earlier this year for modifications after concerns that batteries on board could cause fires. A Heathrow spokesman said yesterday: 'Heathrow's runways are now fully open following an earlier fire on board an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft which the airport's emergency services attended. Grounded: Boeing temporarily withdrew the Dreamliner from service earlier this year after two incidents where the jet's battery caught fire . Emergency: Several fire crews were called out to deal with the fire on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow Airport yesterday afternoon . Staff from Boeing were on the ground at Heathrow to investigate the events on Friday afternoon . 'The aircraft was parked on a remote parking stand and there were no passengers on board. Arrivals and departures were temporarily suspended while airport fire crews attended to this incident. This is a standard procedure if fire crews are occupied with an incident.' The fire appeared to have caused damage to the top of the plane's fuselage. An Ethiopian Airlines statement said: 'Smoke was detected from Ethiopian Airlines B787 aircraft... which was parked at London Heathrow airport for more than eight hours.

Boeing shares fell sharply on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday after news broke of the incident. Thomson . Airways became the first British carrier to operate the Dreamliner . earlier this week, and is taking delivery of eight of the planes. The company had hoped to take delivery of the first of its 787s in time to start Dreamliner operations in May. But a series of battery problems led to the grounding of the plane earlier this year while modifications were carried out. Thomson had to scrap plans to use the ultra-green aircraft in May and June, and only received its first plane in June. The . battery problems followed endless production difficulties for the . Dreamliner, which has been marketed as a quiet, fuel-efficient aircraft . carrying between 201 and 290 passengers on medium-range routes. It . should have entered passenger service in 2008 but it was not until . October 2011 that the first commercial flight was operated by Japanese . carrier All Nippon Airways. British .

The Government was accused yesterday of colluding with the Kremlin by blocking a call for a public inquiry into the death of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko. Ministers refused a coroner’s request to replace with a public inquiry the current inquest into how the former KGB agent was poisoned with radiation at a London hotel. Mr Litvinenko’s widow Marina yesterday described the decision as ‘shocking’ and her legal team accused Russia and Britain of colluding to stop the inquiry. Justice: The family of Alexander Litvinenko wanted a public inquiry into his death in 2006 . Dismay: Marina Litvinenko outside the Royal Courts of Justice, in central London today where she vowed to continue her quest for the truth . She will now seek a judicial review . for a public inquiry that will hear in private sensitive evidence about . Mr Litvinenko’s work and Russia’s involvement in his November 2006 . death. Sir Robert Owen asked Justice . Secretary Chris Grayling for the public inquiry due to concerns he . cannot fully investigate the case. This was because evidence from MI5 . and MI6 about the death would remain secret. At the inquest at the High . Court yesterday he said his request had been rejected without . explanation. Alexander Litvinenko poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square in 2006 . Foreign Secretary William Hague last . month successfully applied for some sensitive material, including . evidence on whether the Russian government was involved in the death, to . be kept private. This meant it could not be considered during the inquest. The court has already heard that the Government has ‘established’ Moscow has a case to answer over Mr Litvinenko’s death. Asked outside court if she thought . Britain preferred good relations with Russia rather than justice, Mrs . Litvinenko replied: ‘We can all see this. This is what it looks like.’ She said that it was a ‘political . decision’, adding: ‘Were they trying to protect the Russian state? Were . they trying to protect national security secrets? ‘I respect England as a country and I still believe in this country.  I believe again that we will  get justice.’ Mrs Litvinenko’s solicitor Elena . Tsirlina said: ‘What has happened behind the scenes and publicly between . Russia and Britain is  very hard to say, but it is shocking that this . public inquiry has  been stopped.’ Close friend Alexander Goldfarb said: . ‘This decision will stand in the same line as the long history of . appeasement to dictatorships.’ Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with . radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in . Mayfair at a meeting with former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry . Kovtun. Both deny involvement in his death.

Colombian drug trafficker Daniel Barrera aka 'El Loco' is escorted by policemen before being deported to the United States at the Antinarcotics Police Airport in Bogota on Tuesday . Colombian drug kingpin Daniel Barrera made his first appearance in a U.S. court on Wednesday and pleaded not guilty to conspiring to import cocaine into the United States. Prosecutors have described the 44-year-old Barrera - nicknamed ‘El Loco’ or ‘the madman’ - as one of the largest cocaine distributors in history. They have amassed a wealth of evidence against the cosmetically enhanced drug lord, who allegedly had several plastic surgeries and tried to burn off his fingerprints with acid to mask his identity. Ruben Oliva, his lawyer, said Barrera would demand a trial by jury and denied his client had the surgeries. Prosecutors . allege that Barrera laundered tens of millions of dollars of profits as . he processed about 30,000 kilograms of raw cocaine into cocaine powder . each month since 1998. He . conspired with others to distribute cocaine ‘knowing and intending’ that some would be imported into the United States, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jenna Dabbs said at the hearing in Manhattan federal court. Barrera, . with a light beard and wearing jeans and a black-and-white golf shirt, . spoke briefly in Spanish at the hearing, confirming his attorney and . that he understood the proceedings. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said Barrera would remain in detention. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. The Colombian drug lord is allegedly had several plastic surgeries and even tried to burn off his fingerprints with acid to mask his identity . The U.S. Treasury Department in March 2010 put Barrera on its list of most-wanted Colombian narcotics traffickers. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has called Barrera ‘the last of the great capos.’ He was arrested last September in Venezuela. He was then sent to Colombia, where the U.S. pursued his extradition. Venezuelan officials say they confiscated houses, ranches, a yacht, apartments and 48 cars from Barrera, U.S. authorities said. Barrera arrived in the United States on Tuesday after being extradited from Colombia. In March 2010 the U.S. Treasury Department put Barrera on its list of most-wanted Colombian narcotics traffickers . He is accused of buying raw cocaine paste from the leftist rebel group FARC and processing it in laboratories in areas controlled by the now-demobilized paramilitary group the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC. The AUC collected monthly taxes from Barrera, according to the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's indictment, and he is accused of giving money to fund terrorist groups, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC. Evidence against Barrera includes photographs and other documents related to the seizures of cocaine shipments off the coasts of Venezuela and Florida, Dabbs told Hellerstein. In 2000 Barrera provided 1.4 tons of cocaine to an unnamed co-conspirator in Guatemala via a ‘go-fast boat,’ according to the indictment. Barrera is alleged to have laundered tens of millions of dollars of profits as he processed about 30,000 kilograms of raw cocaine into cocaine powder each month since 1998 . He also provided cocaine to the same co-conspirator to be hidden in a container of scrap metal that was being transported to Mexico from Panama in 2004, the indictment said. Barrera was arrested in Venezuela last September with the help of authorities there as well as British and U.S. intelligence agencies. Colombian authorities had been closing in on his organization in the weeks before his arrest, detaining 36 suspected members and seizing five tons of cocaine. Barrera's next appearance in Manhattan federal court is set for September 4. He also faces charges in federal court in Brooklyn and Miami.

The Daily News reports the pair will only use vendors in and . around New York City, where the wedding will be held. 'All the food will . be farm-to-table and the flowers will be in-season flowers. They will . not be shipped in from elsewhere,' a source told the Daily News. And the celebrations are expected to have a strict color theme. Bolton’s wedding planner was spied meeting with . assistants at the Openhouse Gallery on Mulberry St. two weeks ago, and watched models trying on different caterer clothing. 'It was a full-on runway show for the planner to decide on outfits for the staff to wear,' the insider said.

"PUBLISHED: . 16:51 EST, 13 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:51 EST, 13 July 2013 . A state attorney's office employee has been fired after testifying about concerns that prosecutors didn't turn over photos and text messages from Trayvon Martin's cellphone to the defense in George Zimmerman's murder case. Ben Kruidbos received a termination letter Thursday accusing him of misconduct and ‘violating numerous state attorney's office policies and procedures.’ It accused him of disclosure of confidential information, sabotage of property or equipment, and misuse of state attorney equipment. Sacked: Ben Kruidbos, an IT worker from the state attorney's office, testified during a hearing in the George Zimmerman trial on June 6 . Photos from Trayvon Martin's cell phone showed the slain Florida teenager blowing smoke rings, a gun and what appears to be a marijuana plant . Kruidbos retrieved photos and deleted text messages from Martin's cellphone. He testified during a hearing on June 6 that Martin's cell phone contained images of the 17-year-old blowing smoke, images of marijuana and deleted text messages regarding a transaction for a firearm and that those images had not been given to Zimmerman's defense team. He received the termination letter, dated July 11, on Friday, the same day jurors began deliberating Zimmerman's case. The letter states: 'It has come to our attention that you violated numerous State Attorney's Office (SAO) policies and procedures and have engaged in deliberate misconduct that is especially egregious in light of your position.' George Zimmerman with his defense team, Mark O'Mara, left, and Don West, while waiting for jury arrival in the courtroom on Saturday morning . Attorney Wesley White said Kruidbos wasn't surprised by the firing. He had been on paid administrative leave since May 28 from his job as director of information technology for the State Attorney's Office. Kruidbos said that, when he printed a 900-page Florida Department of Law Enforcement report from Martin's cell phone in late 2012 or early 2013, he noticed information was missing. Concerned that attorneys did not have all the information they needed to prepare the case, he said, he reported his concerns to a State Attorney's Office investigator and later to prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda. Kruidbos said he generated a report that was more than three times the size of the one that had been handed over. For example, Kruidbos said that 2,958 photos were in the report given to the defense but that his report contained 4,275 photos. Gun: A photo of a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun was retrieved from Martin's cell phone . The images on Martin's phone included this photo of what appears to be a marijuana plant . Through his attorney, Wesley White, Kruidbos informed Zimmerman's defense team that the information existed. In court, Kruidbos testified that he was concerned that he could be held liable if all information wasn't shared. 'All the information is important in the process to ensure it's a fair trial,' he said. In a six-page dismissal letter, the State Attorney's Office, Fourth Judicial Circuit, blasted Kruidbos' assertions and motivations. Managing Director Cheryl Peek accused Kruidbos of having erased data from a laptop in violation of the Public Records Law and derided his concern about being held liable as 'feigned and spurious' and 'nothing more than shameful manipulation in a shallow, but obvious, attempt to cloak yourself in the protection of the whistleblower law.' Trayvon Martin's cell phone which he was using to speak to Rachel Jeantel when he was attacked . She concluded, 'Because of your deliberate, willful and unscrupulous actions, you can never again be trusted to step foot in this office. Your have left us with no choice but to terminate your employment.' Zimmerman's attorneys were seeking sanctions against the state for not properly turning over the evidence from Martin's phone. O'Mara and co-counsel Don West argued that they needed more time to go through the information found on Martin's phone and asked for a delay, which was denied. Judge Debra Nelson said she would revisit the possibility of sanctions at the trial's end.","In his termination letter Ben Kruidbos was accused of violating state attorney office policies and procedures .

Data collected from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn is being used to help people who may be a suicide risk . The study is focusing on former military personnel in the U.S. where 22 veterans take their own lives every day, an average of one every 65 minutes, according to a recent government report. Doctors working on the Durkheim Project, which is supported by Facebook, are hoping that clues from social interaction will help care workers identify patients before they fatally harm themselves. Social media: Computer experts are looking for clues about the use of Twitter and Facebook by people at risk of killing themselves . The research is a joint venture by the predictive . analytics firm Patterns and Predictions and the Veterans Education and . Research Association of Northern New England. Last year, suicides among active members . of the military reached 349, more than those killed on duty and experts believe the military culture makes those at risk less . likely to ask for help or admit they need it. Dr. Craig J. Bryan, associate director of the . National Center for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah  told NBC News: 'We do know factors that increase risk such as depression, but our best methods rely on . individuals telling us,' The  Durkheim Project adviser, added:  'A lot of people who die by suicide . don't tell people they're thinking of it, so the difficulty is trying to . figure out if there are other indicators that go around this problem.' Clues: Researchers are analysing data from Twitter, Facebook to discover people most at risk of suicide . The study put together three groups using 300 anonymous medical records from the Veterans Administration - patients who killed themselves, those . under psychiatric care and those wanting  treatment. Common issues showed up - troubled relationships, debt, job loss, post-traumatic stress, health issues and alienation. But computer experts discovered behaviour unique to patients who committed suicide by analysing the language in the medical reports. Project director Chris Poulin told NBC that the . project's consulting doctors who had treated veterans were surprised not . at the common behaviours, but that a . computer programme could detect often subtle clues from the medical . reports . Investigation: Computer experts hope 100,000 volunteers will take part in the project to identify suicide risks among the military1 . 'The technology is trying to find the stories within the stories,' said Durkheim spokesman Gregory Peterson. The computers were alerted by certain language used by the former military personal such as loneliness or agitation. Findings will not be published for some time but the project hopes to get 100,000 volunteers to take part. Data will come from a variety of apps that will continuously upload the subjects' social media and mobile phone interactions. The project accepts that to really know more about what pushes patients to suicide, the researchers have to wait for people to die. Mr Poulin said: It's not a happy topic. I don't think we should back away from it just because it's taboo or so stressful, there's no negative intent there, no creepy objective. This is the cost of doing business in life-or-death research.'","Study focusing on former military personnel in U.S. where 22 veterans take their own lives every day .

Loyalists in Northern Ireland celebrated the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne at midnight by lighting hundreds of bonfires across the city. The celebration, known as Eleventh Night, prompted one call every 77 seconds at its peak to the fire brigade as crowds burned piles of wood and furniture. Elsewhere, a member of the nationalist SDLP party claimed a death threat against him had been burned on a bonfire in County Londonderry. Stormont Assembly member John Dallat . said police warned him of the sinister message in Garvagh, which said . life would not be normal until he was disposed of. Mr Dallat said that police had been . unable to persuade organisers of the bonfire to remove a scarf in the . shape of a noose that was on display. Hundreds of bonfires, including this one in the Sandy Row area of Belfast, were lit across Northern Ireland overnight to commemorate Eleventh Night . Stacks of pallets burned at the loyalist Ballycraigy Estate in Antrim on the outskirts of Belfast overnight as residents stood back to watch . Children wave the Union flag at a fire on the Highfield estate in west Belfast to celebrate King James II's defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 . 'When I visited Garvagh just before midnight, it was very clear that the number of people turning out to support this event was a mere handful compared to years ago,' he said. 'Clearly the people of Garvagh have had enough of the wanton sectarianism that has being going on in the name of loyalism and they don't find it appealing or entertaining.' He added: 'While the death threat won't inhibit me in any way, I do take note that those involved are dangerous people who can't be ignored and should not be ignored because they have the capacity to attract the interest of loyalist paramilitaries who over the years claimed the lives of many people in East Derry.' SDLP member John Dallat said that death threats had been made against him in the bonfires . Eleventh Night is a reference to the evening before July 12, the day when Protestants commemorate the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. The celebration marks the defeat of . the Catholic King James, by the Protestant William of Orange, . which was one of the major turning points in Irish history. The annual demonstration sees . thousands of Orange Order members and bandsmen join parades across . Northern Ireland, which have sparked serious rioting and violence in recent years between loyalists and nationalists. A total of 550 . parades were due to take place throughout Northern Ireland today. Firefighters attended some blazes to . cool down nearby homes to protect them from the fierce heat, with 42 of . the 184 calls on the night related to the event. One fire crew had to withdraw from a . bonfire in Craigavon, County Armagh, after youths threw stones at them, . though nobody was injured. A blaze at Cluan Place, east Belfast, near where serious . sectarian rioting has broken out in the past, caused some minor external damage to a nearby building. The . Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said only 15 calls required . help from its crews, who also attended 25 minor gorse and grass fires. Eleventh Night, celebrated here on the Highfield estate, refers to the night before July 12, when Protestants commemorate the Battle of the Boyne . The victory of William of Orange, marked in the Protestant Sandy Row area of Belfast, is a significant point in Irish history . The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service received one call every 77 seconds at the height of activity last night . The 184 calls was almost double the number received on the same night last year, the service said. More than 40 displays have been deemed to be contentious by authorities, resulting in hundreds of extra police . officers been drafted on to the streets. In recent years police . officers have been battered with bricks, bottles and petrol bombs. Last year shots were also fired and a pipe bomb hurled at police lines in the Ardoyne. Unionist . anger has intensified in recent days over a decision to ban an Orange . Order parade past a sectarian flash point at Ardoyne. A man photographed the bonfire on the Ballycraigy estate on his mobile phone during celebrations . Last night bonfires were lit while today there were 550 parades planned across Northern Ireland . The Parades Commission adjudication . body banned Orangemen from taking the same route past shops in Ardoyne . on their return journey in . the afternoon. The area has been the scene of intense rioting on July 12 in recent years. The Orange Order branded the commission's decision 'ludicrous' but urged supporters not to react with violence. The decision by the Commission was the . first time it ruled that the Orange Order cannot hold an evening . parade past Ardoyne. It came after intensive talks with nationalist . residents failed to reach agreement. The fire at Lanark Way in the Shankill area of west Belfast could be seen from 20 miles away . The Lanark Way bonfire, which was lit by actor Ross Kemp as part of his investigative television series, reached its peak at 1am . At the Battle of the Boyne about . 36,000 troops commanded by King William III defeated an army of 25,000 troops led by King James II along the river Boyne . near the town of Drogheda on the Irish east coast.

William . and his wife Mary II jointly reigned over England, Scotland and . Ireland. Their reign saw the end of fears that England would return to . Catholicism, as James wanted.

This is now the home of radical Isliamist Abu Qatada- the reviled hate preacher who used human rights appeals to prolong his stay in Britain. Inside: Abu Qatada occupies a communal cell like this one, where there is a TV mounted on the wall and inmates can choose to wear their own clothes . Facilities: Muwaqqar Prison has a library where students can read and study. The Jordanian jail holds 718 inmates in total . Ominous: For all its perks, the prison looks daunting with barbed-wire fences and watch towers . The 53-year-old is being held in Muwaqqar Jail outside Amman, where he shares a cell with 15 other inmates. Many of the prisoners have been sentenced or charged with offences against state security. Muwaqqar is known as one of Jordan's best-kept prisons. Colour-coded textbooks and maps are lined up in the prison's libraries and there is a computer room for the inmates. The inmates are allowed to wear their own clothes, and only have to wear a brown prison uniform to leave their cell. They are referred to as 'guests,' according to the Sun, where . they can be visited by friends or relatives for half an hour, three . times a week. Charged: Qatada is being held on terrorist charges. He was deported from Belmarsh prison in London on Sunday after eight years of stalling . Conditions: Prison inmates can use volleyball or football courts (pictured right) for exercise at the prison. Officers guard the prison's entrance (left) Activities: Abu Qatada will tend to plants and vegetables in the greenhouse with other prison 'guests' Green-fingered: Inmates plant shrubs and flowers in the baking Jordanian desert as part of their dauily ritual at Muwaqqar . Football and voleyball pitches are used during recreation time by the prison's 'guests'. The . prison has 240 solitary confinement cells, but Qatada has been placed . in a communal cell, where he will bunk with other inmates. He was transferred there on Sunday from Belmarsh prison in South East London. According to the Telegraph, Qatada's family have already been to visit him, speaking with him through a glass barrier. Once Qatada left the UK and landed at . Jordan’s Marka military airport, the authorities moved swiftly. He was . driven in a green SUV, escorted by a 12-car convoy, to the sealed-off . state security court in Amman. Military prosecutors charged him with . conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts, remanded him in custody for 15 . days and then took him to Muwaqqar prison. Well-kept: Muwaqqar is known for having high standards . Textbook: Rows of colour-coded mathematics books are available to prisoners who want to further their education . He was first arrested over . his alleged terror connections in 2001. He was rearrested in 2005, when . attempts to deport him began. He lodged appeal after appeal, claiming . his human rights would be infringed if he was sent home – finally . winning his case in the European Court of Human Rights last year. But Home Secretary Theresa May continued to pursue his . removal, signing a landmark treaty with Jordan promising that no . evidence obtained by torture would be used against him. Part of the treaty ensures Qatada's proper treatment in prison.","Radical Islamist cleric is being held in Jordan's Muwaqqar Jail .

Silvio Berlusconi's party boycotted a summit of Italy's fragile coalition government and blocked parliamentary activity on Wednesday in protest against a supreme court decision to fast track a ruling that could ban him from public office. The former premier's party forced legislative procedures to be suspended in parliament for a day, because of the protest by Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) party, one of the two main partners in Enrico Letta's left-right coalition government. While the disgraced former leader was embroiled in political campaigning, his daughter Eleonora Berlusconi was pictured relaxing on a quiet and secluded beach in Sardinia, with British model boyfriend, Guy Binns and their son Riccardo. Happy couple: Eleonora Berlusconi with British model Guy Binns and his son Richard at Villa Certosa, Porto Rotondo, Sardinia . Miss Berlusconi, 27, has been linked to the British model since 2011 and the couple looked content in each others company on the Italian isle. They reportedly first met at a Milan fashion show and were said to have started dating straight after. The pair, who are on holiday at the Villa Certosa, Porto Rotondo, in Sardinia, made themselves comfortable in the shade with seven-month-old son sat between them. They are on holiday with friends as well as Barbara Berlusconi, the former premier's glamorous daughter, who was spotted relaxing in the sun and getting close to economics student Lorrenzo Guerrieri this week. Father Silvio Berlusconi announced the arrival of his seventh grandchild in January when he was invited to the TV programme Otto e mezzo. Content: The couple looked relaxed and content as they sheltered from the sun on a secluded beach in Sardinia . Good life: Eleonora Berlusconi smiles as her boyfriend and father of her son Riccardo reaches in for a kiss . He was quoted saying at the time: 'The political issues are far away from me now. I became grandfather for the seventh time: a baby named Riccardo was welcomed by my daughter Eleonora, he weighs 3kg and 200grams,' he said during the interview. Now however, it appears political issues are inescapable for the former prime minister who is trying to appeal being barred from politics. The supreme court decision to fast track a ruling to ban him from public office, has aggravated tension in the squabbling coalition which was already under fire for the slow pace of reforms desperately needed to boost recovery from the worst recession since World War Two. Beppe Grillo, leader of the populist 5-Star Movement which stunned Italy by winning an unprecedented quarter of the vote in a February election, said Italy was heading for catastrophe because of the government's failure to take extraordinary measures to tackle the economy. He said Italy was like a pressure cooker 'on the verge of blowing up' and called on President Giorgio Napolitano to call an election as soon as possible. The daughter of Italy's former premier has been linked to Brit Guy Binns since 2011 . The arrival of the couple's baby boy was announced by Silvio Berlusconi in January during a TV interview . Beautiful setting: The serene scene was far from the political turmoil that faces Silvio Berlusconi whose party blocked legislative proceedings today via a boycott . The supreme court was forced to issue an unusual statement defending its decision on Tuesday to hear Berlusconi's final appeal on July 30 against a tax fraud conviction. The 76-year-old media magnate's lawyers had not expected a ruling until late in the year. The court will rule on whether to uphold a four-year jail term and five-year ban on holding public office for complicity in tax fraud at Berlusconi's Mediaset television empire. Although Berlusconi will probably escape jail because of his age if the sentence is confirmed, he could be thrown out of parliament in what would be a major shock to Letta's fragile government. Letta said the government would survive whatever happened but some hawks in Berlusconi's party are thought to want to force an election in October if he is condemned. In an attempt to ensure PDL loyalty, Letta again promised in a television interview that he would abolish a hated housing tax which is the PDL's central demand, despite the difficulty of remaining within European Union budget constraints. The groups of friends spent some time on the beach relaxing before carrying their buggies and children back over the rocks . The supreme court said it had been forced to call a special summer sitting on July 30 because part of the case against Berlusconi will expire under the state of limitations on August 1. Berlusconi and his aides believe the court decision, in sharp contrast to the usual snail's pace of Italy's legal system, is another example of what he calls sustained and undemocratic persecution by leftist magistrates. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, pictured in February, faces a supreme court decision to fast track a ruling to ban him from public office . The former premier said the decision was inspired by his enemies in the Milan prosecutor's office who have brought many cases against him, including his recent conviction for paying for sex with a Moroccan-born underage nightclub dancer nicknamed 'Ruby the Heartstealer' and abusing his office to try to cover it up. He was sentenced to seven years jail in the 'bunga bunga' case last month but that sentence will not become definitive until two appeals are exhausted. Berlusconi has played a key role since Letta's government was formed in April in keeping his hawkish lieutenants on a tight leash, but the supreme court decision has sparked demands for street protests and blocking of all parliamentary activity. A substantial faction of Letta's own centre-left Democratic Party also opposes the government alliance with Berlusconi but Napolitano, the effective godfather of the coalition, is adamantly opposed to early elections in the midst of Italy's worst postwar recession.","Legislative procedures to be suspended in parliament for a day after Berlusconi's party protested against a court ruling to ban him from office .

Hollywood is bracing itself for one of its most disappointing months in recent memory after a series of big budget productions have bombed at the box office. This summer has seen fierce competition at cinemas with over 20 films boasting budgets of $100 million (£66million) or more fighting to fill the seats. Top of the flops appears to be Disney's $225 million 'The Lone Ranger' which despite starring roles for Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, only brought in $29 million on it's opening July 4 weekend. Scroll down for video . Bombs away: Disney's $225 million 'The Lone Ranger' starring Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer brought in a disappointing $29 million on its opening weekend . It followed a disastrous opening for Sony’s $150 million 'White House Down' which garnered a paltry $25 million on the weekend of June 28. And there are serious concerns over Guillermo del Toro's $180 million sci-fi monster romp 'Pacific Rim' which is expected to open at around $30 million this weekend.

And even the normally reliable Dreamworks production house could be left with a stinker as 'Turbo', a $135 million family film about a snail with dreams of speed, is also expected to do badly when it opens on the same weekend.

"By . Liz Jones . PUBLISHED: . 16:43 EST, 10 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:49 EST, 10 July 2013 . There have been a handful of pioneering women who have transformed our quality of life. Marie Curie. Marie Stopes. Emily Wilding Davison. Helen Gurley Brown. Margaret Thatcher. Today, to this venerable list, we can add the name Belinda Earl, style supremo at Marks & Spencer, whose no-nonsense attitude is about to ensure women will be able to wave at a friend, hail a taxi and enthusiastically applaud a win at the tennis without looking round furtively, then performing said action with elbows firmly planted in ribs, like a trussed chicken. Because, earlier this week at the M&S annual general meeting Ms Earl confirmed to shareholders that from now on 90 per cent of her dresses would have sleeves: real sleeves, extending to our elbows and wrists. Sleeves to love: The Per Una scarlet lace applique dress is £119, but the white wool coat (right) is a pricey £349 . Like flapper girls discarding their corsets, women in the auditorium breathed a big sigh of relief. They’d have clapped - if they could. Ms Earl hopes these sleeves will lure back female shoppers to the store, which this week saw clothing sales fall again (by 1.6 per cent, a slight improvement on the previous quarter). I’d like to take a small amount of credit for the reintroduction of sleeves. I have long campaigned for their comeback, and raised the issue when I met the new style director to preview her autumn collection in April. You might think that I’m over-egging Ms Earl’s contribution to female well-being and emancipation, given she has merely made the decision to add sleeves to M&S’s new autumn/winter collection, which will filter into shops over the next few weeks. Sleeves are being revived by Marks and Spencer for its dresses after customers put pressure on the company . New lines: This Autograph dress is £69 . But all women over 16 know exactly how . much your upper arms feature in your choice of activities, hobbies, . holidays and level of enthusiasm for everyday life. Ah, you might say, but don’t women . worry about their buttocks, their tummies and their breasts, too? Yes, . but on the whole, unless you are Rihanna, these parts of your anatomy . can remain largely covered and hoiked and helped, a truism supported by . the fact that bestsellers at M&S remain thigh smoothers, push-up . bras, tummy controllers and even jeans that scoop your buttocks up. Perversely, the fashion of late is for . our arms to be completely unfettered: never mind the ubiquitous . spaghetti strap, the fashion industry these days even makes sleeveless . coats and jackets. I have no idea why they do this. Perhaps it is . because they haven’t fully appreciated how devilishly hard it is  to . tone the hammocky tricep muscle - otherwise known as the bingo wing. Style classic: This Per Una LBD costs £89 . High street fashion: Models pose in new collection for Marks and Spencer at their annual AGM . Even superfit, muscle-bound, . powerhouse Serena Williams experienced a bit of arm flap during . Wimbledon. Never mind her defeat, my heart went out to her for her upper . arms. ‘Hold that serve Serena,’ I wanted to yell. ‘Have a long-sleeved . T-shirt!’ Why no High Street brand has taken . M&S’s new stance is baffling. Brands like Jaeger, supposedly on the . side of the older woman, sell us sparkly wraps and shrugs and boleros, . which make us fiddle self-consciously all evening. Another supposed champion of the . over-40s woman is Mary Portas. Her sole contribution to the great arm . cover-up been a weird garment called the Armery: a pair of tights you . wear on your arms. Just go the whole hog and wear tights over your head. After all, wearing tights on your arms . is a bit like a post-menopausal woman going out to dinner carrying a . shaving mug and Bic razor. It screams middle-age, and we don’t want to . advertise our flaws. Saviour: Liz is delighted style director Belinda Earl has listened to what women want . When I previewed Belinda Earl’s . autumn/winter collection I was so relieved at the re-emergence of the . sleeve I would have hugged her, had I not been afraid of squashing my . bare, flabby, cellulite-ridden upper arms against her torso. Such was my . excitement that she then and there promised to add sleeves to 80  per . cent of M&S’s garments - and at the AGM on Tuesday she had added 10 . per cent to the figure she gave me in the spring. I can hear some of you worrying: ‘Aren’t all these long sleeves terribly mumsy and frumpy?’ Not if you follow certain rules. Earl . has grasped this beautifully. The first rule is to avoid a sleeve that’s . baggy and flaps. It must be narrow and fitted, in a fabric with a hint . of stretch. Earl’s sleeves are most often three-quarter-length, reaching . just above the elbow, to avoid constriction and creasing. They come in . lace, or a contrasting sheer fabric, for a feeling of nakedness and . airiness, which we’re all used to. Pret-a-porter: Liz was given a sneak peek at M&S' new range in May and was glad to see more sleeves . Next month sees the arrival of a black . cocktail dress with sheer narrow sleeves; decorated with ribbon blooms, . and a stretchy nude lining. At £75, it’s great value for a 100 per . cent silk dress. In September, a white waffle dress with three- . quarter-length sleeves will hit the rails, £79: perfect for the office, . or dinner. So, top marks to Belinda for resurrecting the sleeve. Nakedness, especially in a hot spell, isn’t the coolest option, and a . moist, stubbly underarm will never pass muster in the boardroom or . anywhere else. But I still think Earl needs to be . more radical before M&S is back to its best. When she told me in our . interview that she was cutting product lines by 50 per cent, I cheered. But later I realised I had misheard . her and she had said 15 per cent. M&S still carried far too much . choice, and too many sub-brands, particularly Per Una and Indigo. The . slight improvement in sales should be taken with a pinch of M&S sea . salt: her very first garment doesn’t go on sale until July 25. Let’s wait till Christmas before . pronouncing the new, more expensive direction she is taking as a huge . mistake (who will pay £349 for an M&S coat, even if it is 100 per . cent wool and British-made). But for now, let us be happy. Belinda Earl is waving the flag for grown-up women, with not a bingo wing in sight. Now, if only she would just jettison those ghastly waterfall cardigans...","The chain promises 90 per cent of all dresses will now have sleeves .

But since my daughter Katie told me, about 15 years ago, that I 'must stop wearing those ridiculous jeans' (high-waisted, bit baggy, tapering to the ankle - you know the kind of thing) I've tried to at least be influenced by current trends. Katie put me into a pair of straight-legged Levis and I was a new woman; or at least the old one refurbished, like a second-hand armchair. There have been many fashions over the past decade or so that have been only too easy and flattering to adopt, from flared trousers to skinny jeans. But there comes a point, once over a certain age, when you have to tread very carefully when adopting the latest Big Thing In Fashion. City shorts are a case in point. I'm not going to alert you to my legs' many faults, but given they don't even turn a respectable honey colour in the summer, I generally save shorts for holidays and only wear skirts at a comforting mid-knee length. The thought of sporting short shorts, no matter how tailored, begs several tricky questions. Will they have a pocket for my bus pass? Will my bare knees turn blue in the supermarket frozen food section? Can any mature woman wear them without looking like mutton dressed as very young, inappropriately frisky lamb? But though I may be 67, I'm still waiting to wake up feeling like a grown-up, so I decide the only answer is to give them a try . . . SPORTY TWEED . NOT SO DOTTY .

Mr Ding-A-Ling ice cream truck in upstate New York, was arrested on a . DUI charge and later fired . Phil Hollister, from upstate New York, now has a snowball's chance in hell of getting back behind the wheel of his Mr Ding-A-Ling ice cream truck following a DUI arrest. Hollister, of Gloversville, was pulled over in his truck shortly after midnight Saturday on suspicion of driving under the influence. A test has revealed that the 53-year-old had a blood-alcohol level of .15 per cent, or nearly twice the legal limit, Albany Times Union reported. Mr Ding-A-Ling's owner has since fired Hollister and took back the truck. Hollister made national news in April when he accused the operators of a rival ice cream truck, Sno Kone Joe, of harassing him. The bellicose ice cream vendor may have won the battle against his arch-enemies, who have been charged with harassment and stripped of their city permit, but ultimately he lost the war. At around 12.10am Saturday, Hollister nearly crashed his 2-ton truck into the cruiser of a Fulton County Sheriff's deputy on Route 123. Earlier in the night, the 53-year-old was selling sweet, cold treats at a local fireworks show. Afterwards, Hollister said that he ducked into a bar, where he downed three or four cocktails in 30 minutes before getting back on the road. Feud: Cops say Joshua Malatino began harassing the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck as soon as it hit the streets of Gloversville, New York in April . Mr Hollister was arrested on a DUI charge after failing a sobriety test. He is due back in court August 15. Meanwhile, the hapless ice cream man has been frozen out by his boss, Brian Collis. The . owner of Mr Ding-A-Ling said that he will hire another driver to . replace Hollister on his route covering Futlon and Montgomery counties. Hollister's . stint behind the wheel of the Mr Ding-A-Ling ice cream truck may have . only lasted five months, but it was filled with headline-grabbing drama. In April, Hollister complained to police that Sno Kone Joe operator Joshua Malatino was making threats, including yelling things like ‘you don’t have a chance.' Ice cream: Something went sour this spring season when Sno Kone Joe, AKA Joshua Malatino, allegedly began driving his rival out of town with threats and harassment . Threats: Joshua Malatino, left, owner of Sno Cone Joe ice cream trucks, was charged with harassing and stalking a rival company's driver along with girlfriend Amanda Scott, right . Hollister claimed Malatino, along with . his girlfriend Amanda Scott, 21, also tried to intimidate him by . stalking him around town in their own ice cream truck, blasting their . music loudly when near him, and yelling ‘free ice cream!’ when they saw . someone approaching the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck. ‘I . own this town,’ Malatino allegedly yelled in a phone call to Mr. Ding-A-Ling headquarters, where he claimed Gloversville as his ice cream . turf and nobody else’s. On April 19, Gloversville police witnessed Malatino’s harassment while on patrol. An officer saw a Sno Cone Joe truck tailgating a Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck at a red light, even though Police Capt. John Sira said that the 34-year-old had been warned in the past about this type of behavior. Enough: Phil Hollister, pictured, driver of the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck went ot police after he says hewas fed up with Malatino's antics . Police investigated the case and on April 30, Malatino and Scott were arrested on charges of harassment and misdemeanor stalking on three separate occasions. Following a lengthy court battle between the Albany-based Sno Kone King and Mr. Ding-A-Ling, Malatino's company has lost its permit in Gloversville. Gloversville Mayor Dayton King told the station CBS 6 Albany that Collis will be able to keep his permit so long as Hollister is kept away from his trucks. Malatino and Scott are due back in court July 29 to face their charges of harassment. Sweet deal: Hollister, pictured, said Malatino even offered free ice cream to people who approached the Mr. Ding-A-Ling truck . Victor? The owner of Mr. Ding-A-Ling said his truck will continue working the streets of Gloversville in spite of the upset . During the drawn-out legal battle . between the two rivals, Sno Kone Joe's lawyers showed a video, which . reportedly depicted Hollister dancing to their truck’s music and . flipping off the drivers in full view of young customers. For his part, the 53-year-old newly unemployed man said that he is now looking to get into the home remodelling business.","Phil Hollister, 53, had blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit when he nearly crashed ice cream truck into police cruiser .

A message in a bottle written by ten-year-old Sidonie Fery washed up on a Long Island beach in the wake of Superstorm Sandy - two years after her death at the age of 18 . The note in the bottle, left, contained a New York City phone number. The workers in Patchogue, Long Island, who found it left a message and three hours later, Sidonie's mother Mimi, right, called them back in tears . 'I was just sobbing when I heard they . had found it,' Ms Fery said. 'These are very, very kind people.' The note read: 'Be excellent to yourself, dude' - a reference to Sidonie's favorite film, which starred Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter as the time-traveling school friends. When Ms Fery heard what the note said, she said she knew instantly that it had been written by her daughter. She also said it had a second meaning to her, that she should not worry about Sidonie who died in Switzerland while attending boarding school. 'It makes so much sense.' Ms Fery described her daughter, an only child, a creative youngster who always wrote poetry. Sidonie was a 'very artistic and vivacious young woman' with an independent streak, who had traveled alone to visit relatives in Iran every summer from the age of seven. Born on September 11, 1991, the little . girl was often teased and harassed after the 9/11 terror attacks on her . tenth birthday by people who didn't understand her Persian heritage. 'She had to deal with a lot of things,' Ms Fery said. 'But she stood her ground.' This weekend, Ms Fery will attend a . ceremony in Patchogue to thank the workers who returned the bottle to . her and dedicate a small plaque to Sidonie. The bottle was found just before Thanksgiving last year among broken docks and boating gear. Brian . Waldron, a Patchogue parks department employee for 23 years, said one . of the temporary workers hired to help with the Sandy clean-up found the . message in a bottle. Sidonie's message referenced her favorite film - Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, which starred Keanu Reeves as Bill, right, and Alex Winter as Ted, left . 'We opened it and it had a phone number inside, so I called the number and left a message,' he said. More than three hours later, a tearful and overjoyed Ms Fery called back. They quickly arranged a meeting in Patchogue so he could hand over the bottle. 'I told her I felt like her daughter was looking down from heaven and wanted me to give her a call,' said Mr Waldron. He also collected a second bottle filled with sand from where the ginger ale bottle was found and gave it to Ms Fery.

High-speed smash: Baroness Billingham survived the crash when her car was hit by a people carrier which had allegedly jumped the lights . A Labour Shadow Minister has told how she was nearly killed in a high-speed car crash which threw her vehicle across three lanes of traffic after being hit by a driver linked to the Qatari embassy. Baroness Billingham’s Toyota Prius was shunted 30ft across a busy Central London street after the collision with a people-carrier which had apparently failed to stop at a red light. The peer had to be cut free from the wreckage by rescue workers. Doctors were stunned to discover that the 73-year-old did not sustain life-threatening injuries. Lady Billingham said: ‘I am making a recovery – it was a hell of a shock. I should be dead, make no bones about it.’ Labour’s spokesman on culture, media and sport, Lady Billingham sustained injuries to her thorax, and still has difficulties breathing five months after the accident. She is unable to take part in strenuous activities such as tennis, and is undergoing physiotherapy. She plans to use the three-month Parliamentary recess to recover fully. ‘I am determined to get back in shape. I could have been paralysed or even killed,’ she said. Lady Billingham was driving back to her home in Hampstead, North London, after a House of Lords debate when the crash happened in Gloucester Place,  near Marble Arch. It is believed that the driver of the people-carrier failed to stop at a side road called George Street, and hit the peer’s Prius so hard that it was flung across the lanes, ending up on the opposite pavement. ‘It was all very frightening,’ she said. ‘The driver hit me at a right angle on my side of the car. Thank goodness there was nothing along those three lanes at the time and that nobody was pushing a pram along the pavement.’ Crash scene: Lady Billington's car was hit near Marble Arch in central London . The peer, who also suffered psychological trauma, took two months off work. She said her insurers told her the driver, Jemal Mohammed Amin, 40, worked for the Qatar embassy’s transport staff. However, an embassy spokesman said: ‘The driver is not an embassy driver. He works for a car hire company so it’s nothing to do with us.’ But when The Mail on Sunday made inquiries at his luxury flat in Chelsea, Amin’s wife, Khedra, said her husband was a driver for the Qatari embassy. Amin has been charged with driving without due care and attention, and is due to appear before City of London Magistrates’ Court next Friday. Lady Billingham declined to comment on whether she is suing the driver over the accident.

Spooks warn of potentially ‘catastrophic’ consequences of extremists gaining access to sarin, ricin, mustard gas and . VX - described as ‘the deadliest nerve agent ever created’. Extremist . elements in Syria represent ‘the most worrying terrorist . threat’ to the UK and its allies, the  parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee . said. Threat: Rebel fighters sit in front of shuttered shops in the neighborhood of Beit Hujaira, south of the Syrian capital capital Damascus . Warning: While Free Syrian Army fighters have had to rely on homemade weapons, British spy chief warn Al- Qaeda-linked groups could seize chemical weapons with 'catastrophic' consequences . In its annual report, the ISC said there was ‘serious . concern’ about the security of the ‘vast stockpiles’ of chemical . weapons amassed by the regime of president Bashar Assad. MI6 chief Sir John Sawers told the committee there was the . risk of ‘a highly worrying proliferation around the time of the regime fall’. The committee said: ‘There has to be a significant risk . that some of the country's chemical weapons stockpile could fall into the hands . of those with links to terrorism, in Syria or elsewhere in the region. If this . happens, the consequences could be catastrophic.’ Fears: MI6 chief Sir John Sawers said the Assad regime had stepped up its stockpiling of chemical weapons before the conflict erupted . Senior government ministers have warned of the threat posed to Britain by extremists fighting in Syria. Foreign Secretary William Hague has warned a terror attack could be launched in the UK by Britons radicalised while fighting with rebels in Syria. He suggested a 'substantial number' of British fighters had joined the battle to defeat president Bashar Assad, posing 'current and future risks to UK national security'. And last month Prime Minister David Cameron disclosed that al . Qaeda-linked elements in the opposition movement had attempted to acquire . chemical weapons for probable use in Syria. The ISC said there is now a risk that extremist elements in Syria could take advantage of the ‘permissive . environment’ there to plot attacks on targets in the West. ‘Large numbers of radicalised individuals have been attracted . to the country, including significant numbers from the UK and Europe,’ the . report said. ‘They are likely to acquire expertise and experience . which could significantly increase the threat posed when they return home. ‘Furthermore, there is growing concern about the risks . around extremist groups in Syria gaining access to regime stocks of chemical . weapons.’ The report also highlighted the growing threat of attacks . by ‘lone actors’, such as the stabbing of Labour MP Stephen Timms while holding . a surgery in his east London constituency in 2010. It said the risks are inherently much more difficult for . the security services to manage as, by their nature, lone actors are much . harder to detect - something al Qaida appears determined to exploit. One Home Office official told the committee: ‘There is no . doubt that the more sophisticated people in al Qaida recognise that groups are, . in some ways, a thing of the past; and that encouraging lone acts of terror is . exactly the way forward.’","Weapons stockpiled by Assad before conflict could be seized by rebels .

The British brand said it has had an 'exceptional' response to its spring/summer collection.

Following his designer mother into the fashion world, Romeo was hand-picked by Burberry's chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey, to star in the campaign that was unveiled last December. According to Bailey, Romeo 'stole she show' during the photoshoot with his 'infectious energy' shining through the pictures taken by renowned photographer Mario Testino. Following his mother into fashion: Romeo with his famous parents and brothers Brooklyn and Cruz . Burberry said spring/summer was a 'standout season' for the group, with its high-end Prorsum fashion range and accessories such as the Blaze and Orchard bags proving a hit with shoppers. The first quarter like-for-like sales rise marks an impressive increase over the 7 per cent growth seen in the previous six months, with total retail sales in the three months to June 30 up 18 per cent at £339 million, excluding exchange rate effects.

The group said store sales were led by Hong Kong and China, with double digit growth in comparable trade across Asia Pacific and the Americas, while it saw 'high single-digit' growth across Europe and the rest of its global operations. While customer footfall - the number of shoppers visiting its stores - was 'soft', Burberry said this was offset by strong growth online.

But despite the sales lift, Burberry is still expecting half-year underlying pre-tax profits to drop below the £173 million figure reported a year earlier as wholesale revenues remain under pressure and as it takes an initial hit from bringing perfumes and cosmetics in-house earlier this year. Burberry decided to start making its own beauty products last year, ending a licence agreement with Interparfums - a move that is costing it £155m, but is expected to boost profits over time. Shares shrugged off the disappointing first half profit outlook, rising more than 3 per cent on the sales cheer.

The estranged partner of the woman who killed both their sons and leapt 100ft to her death on Dartmoor is awaiting trial for assaulting her, it emerged yesterday. Neil Patterson, 52, is on bail following the alleged assault three months ago. His address was given as the home he had been sharing until then with Katherine Hooper and their two sons, Josh, five, and two-year-old Sam. Neighbours said he was due to go on trial in the next few weeks – which was causing concern for Miss Hooper, who went missing the day after the alleged assault on April 28, prompting a full-scale helicopter search. Charges: Neil Patterson, 52, is due to appear in court next month for a trial over an alleged assault against partner Katherine Hooper, 24, who killed herself and her two children on Friday . At the time, police described her as ‘a high-risk vulnerable person’. She was found the following morning unconscious and face down in a field. The children were taken into temporary foster care for several weeks while she recovered. Neighbours said that Miss Hooper broke up with long-term partner Patterson after the  incident. On Friday, day-trippers watched in horror as 24-year-old Miss Hooper put Josh on her back and jumped off the rocks at Haytor. Sam’s body was subsequently found at her terraced house  20 miles away in Paignton. A serious case review has now been announced into the care given to the vulnerable mother and her children. She and her children were known to the social workers and had previously been the subject of ‘intervention’. The serious case review will look into whether more could have been done to protect the children. Killed: Joshua, five, (left) died after falling 100ft from the Dartmoor beauty spot, while a body thought to be that of Sam, two, (right) was found at Mrs Hooper's home in Paignton . Flowers: The house in Paignton, Devon, where the body of the two-year-old was found . Dartmoor: Police stood guard near the spot where the pair tragically plunged to their deaths .

Serious case reviews . take place when a child dies and there are signs of abuse or neglect. Neighbour Janette Nolan, 53, said: ‘I . think social services are partly to blame. They should have been looking . after her rather than scrutinising her the whole time. She recently . told me it was like they were waiting for her to slip up so they could . take the kids away. ‘She was a lovely lady, she was innocent, caring, kind but seemed vulnerable and lost. Found dead: Katharine Hooper, who went by the name of Kat, and her son Samuel both died on Friday . Investigation: Police are treating the deaths as murders but are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident . Sons: Joshua, five, (left) and Samuel, two, (right) are both believed to have been killed by their mother . Search: Police outside the Paignton home of Katharine Hooper where the body of a two-year-old boy was found . ‘I think she was frightened of her . future and of being a single parent, but you would have never have . guessed  she would ever have done  anything like this. ‘They were lovely, lovely boys.

Penalty: Greater Manchester Police was fined £166,666 after admitting health and safety breaches after PC Ian Terry, pictured, was shot dead during a training exercise . A police force has been fined £166,666 after one of its officers was shot dead in a warehouse during a training exercise. Greater Manchester Police admitted a health and safety breach after the fatal shooting of father-of-two PC Ian Terry, 32, was killed during a firearms training exercise in June 2008. PC terry was not wearing body armour and was hit from a distance of about 12ins by a blank round of specialist ammunition which is not designed to kill but can be deadly at close range. In January, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy pleaded guilty on behalf of GMP to a breach of Section 2 of the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA) under which an employer has a duty to protect its employees at work. Today, the officer who was in charge of the training session - known only as Francis - was found guilty of a breach of Section 7 of the HSWA for a lack of care towards another employee. Another anonymised officer - Eric - who helped the lead officer in organising the training course was cleared by a jury at Manchester Crown Court of the same allegation. PC Terry, from Burnley, was shot as the unit practised in a disused factory in Newton Heath. He had brandished an unloaded handgun during the exercise while playing the role of a criminal fleeing in a car when he was hit by the specialist ammunition known as round irritant personnel. The jury ruled that there was a catalogue of failures not only by the officer who shot PC Terry but also in the planning, training and safety measures in place. The Crown Prosecution Service later ruled though that the officer who fired the fatal shot, known as Chris at the inquest, should not face any criminal charges. Today, Mr Justice Holroyde also ordered GMP to pay court costs of £90,000. Francis was fined £2.000 and told to pay costs of £500. Tragedy: PC Terry was shot in a training exercise at a disused factory in the Newton Heath area of Manchester. A forensics officer is pictured examining the scene after the shooting . An inquest at Manchester Coroner’s Court in March 2010 had already found that PC Terry was unlawfully killed. In a statement, Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahey said: 'On behalf of Greater Manchester Police, and also personally, I want to apologise for the failings which led to the death of PC Ian Terry and express great sorrow for the pain and loss suffered by his family. 'We accept that there were failings in the way in which the training exercise was carried out and today we accept the sentence that has been passed. Admission: GMP Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy today apologised to PC Ian Terry's family over his death. He had admitted health and safety breaches on behalf of the force . 'Ian Terry was a highly professional and dedicated officer and also a member of a very close and loving family. I know he is missed as much today as the day he died. 'I want to express our admiration for the dignity and love shown by his family over the many years it has taken for the case to get to this point. He added: 'It has been just over five years since Ian Terry tragically died; five years that Ian’s family, friends and colleagues have had to wait for today’s outcome. 'Since Ian’s death we have introduced a number of rigorous measures to ensure that the risk to our officers on such training exercises is minimised and that their safety is our number one priority.' In a statement, the Terry family, including widow Joanne, said: 'Ian was an exceptional man - a brilliant father, husband, son and brother who we will always be proud of. 'He was the heart of the family and always had a smile on his face. His enthusiasm for life was infectious. 'He was also a dedicated police officer who loved his job, and his career was progressing well within the firearms division of GMP . 'The last five years have been horrendous for us. We are a patient and reasonable family and all we have wanted from day one is for those involved in this tragedy to accept their portion of responsibility for what happened to Ian in June 2008. 'In our opinion there have been numerous failings uncovered, not only in respect of the fatal training exercise but in the initial investigation. 'We believe that these failings have only been allowed to occur because Ian was a police officer killed in a police training exercise and as such the incident was not treated with the suspicion it deserved. Tragic: PC Terry, from Burnley, was shot as the unit practised in a disused factory in Newton Heath . 'We were told initially that Ian had been killed in a tragic accident, which clearly was not the case.' The family also expressed disbelief that the officer who fired the fatal shot has not and will not face charges from the CPS. But they added: 'However, we finally have a small measure of satisfaction after years of pain and uncertainty that at least one of the officers we believe are directly responsible for Ian’s death have been proven to be so beyond all doubt and we hope that they now have the courage to accept that responsibility.' HSE principal inspector Mike Calcutt said: 'Ian Terry was a well liked and respected police officer, and a loving family man. 'He was shot and killed on a training exercise in Manchester by one of his colleagues. His death was entirely preventable. 'Today, PC Francis has been found guilty of failing to protect his colleague by introducing dangerous and reckless elements into a training exercise. Greater Manchester Police accepted its failings and we welcomed their guilty plea earlier this year. 'Today is an important day for Ian’s family, who have suffered an ordeal nobody should have to endure and who have waited patiently in their search for justice.'","PC Ian Terry was shot during an exercise at Newton Heath, Manchester .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:08 EST, 11 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:12 EST, 11 July 2013 . 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, pictured after his 2003 capture, asked the CIA if he could keep himself occupied by designing a vacuum cleaner . It sounds like something out of a Graham Greene spy novel. Confined to the basement of a CIA secret prison in Romania about a decade ago, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the man who masterminded the 9/11 terrorist attacks, asked his jailers whether he could embark on an unusual project. Would the spy agency allow Mohammed, who had earned his bachelor's in mechanical engineering, to design a vacuum cleaner? The agency officer in charge of the prison called CIA headquarters and a manager approved the request, a former senior CIA official told The Associated Press. Mohammed had endured the most brutal of the CIA's harsh interrogation methods and had confessed to a career of atrocities. But the agency had no long-term plan for him. Someday, he might prove useful. Perhaps, he'd even stand trial one day. And for that, he'd need to be sane. 'We didn't want them to go nuts,' the former senior CIA official said, one of several who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the now-closed CIA prisons or Mohammed's interest in vacuums. So, using schematics from the Internet as his guide, Mohammed began re-engineering one of the most mundane of household appliances. The unusual activity is reminiscent of Graham Greene's 1958 spy thriller Our Man in Havana, where a vacuum salesman in Cuba agrees to work for the British international spy service MI6. He . dupes the British into believing his vacuum designs are military . installations. It is not known if Mohammed has ever read the novel. Mohammed graduated from North Carolina AT&T State University with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1986. It's not clear whether Mohammed was interested in designing a better vacuum or had ulterior motives. He might have intended to use the plans to conceal secret information or trick his jailers. It remains a mystery how far Mohammed got with his designs or whether the plans still exist. Mohammed's request to design a vacuum cleaner is reminiscent of Our Man in Havana by Graham Greene, pictured, where a vacuum salesman tricks MI6 into thinking his appliance designs are intelligence . Alec Guinness starred in the film adaptation of Our Man in Havana with Jo Morrow . That the CIA may be in possession of . the world's most highly classified vacuum cleaner blueprints is but one . peculiar, lasting byproduct of the controversial U.S. detention and . interrogation program. By the CIA's own account, the program's methods were designed to psychologically 'dislocate' people. But once interrogations stopped, the agency had to try to undo the psychological damage inflicted on the detainees. The CIA apparently succeeded in keeping Mohammed sane. He appears to be in good health, according to military records. Others haven't fared as well. Accused al-Qaeda terrorists Ramzi Binalshibh and Abd al-Nashiri, who were also locked up in Poland and Romania with Mohammed, have had mental issues. Al-Nashiri suffers from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Binalshibh is being treated for schizophrenia with a slew of anti-psychotic medications. 'Any type of prolonged isolation in custody - much less the settings described in the press - have been known to have a severe impact on the mental condition of the detainee,' said Thomas Durkin, Binalshibh's former civilian lawyer. Durkin declined to discuss Binalshibh's case. Mohammed was subjected to harsh interrogations in Poland. Agency officers and contractors forced him to stay awake for 180 hours, according to a CIA inspector general's report. He also underwent 183 instances of waterboarding, or simulated drowning. After the CIA prison in Poland was closed in September 2003, Mohammed was moved to Bucharest, to a black site code-named 'Britelite.' Soon the CIA was trying to find ways to entertain Mohammed as his intelligence value diminished. After detention in Romania, Mohammed was transferred to prison at the United States naval base Guantanamo Bay in Cuba (file photo) The prison had a debriefing room, . where Mohammed, who saw himself as something of a professor, held . 'office hours,' as he told CIA officers. While . chained to the floor, Mohammed would lecture the CIA officers on his . path to jihad, his childhood and family. Tea and cookies were served. Along . with the other five detainees at the prison in Bucharest, Mohammed was . given assignments about his knowledge of al-Qaeda, or 'homework,' as CIA . officers called it. He was given Snickers candy bars as rewards for his studiousness. In Romania, the prison provided books for detainees to read. Mohammed, former officials said, enjoyed the Harry Potter series. For the CIA officers at the prison, not so much. For security reasons, after a prisoner finished a book, they tediously checked every page to ensure detainees weren't passing messages. They once caught Mohammed trying to hide a message in a book warning his prison mates not to talk about Osama bin Laden's courier. The secret CIA prison in Romania was closed in early 2006 and Mohammed was transferred later that year to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base prison, where he remains. It's unlikely he was able to take his appliance plans to Cuba. Mohammed's military lawyer, Jason Wright, said he was prohibited from discussing his client's interest in vacuums. Mohammed admitted responsibility for a string of terror attacks across the world, including 9/11 . 'It sounds ridiculous, but answering this question, or confirming or denying the very existence of a vacuum cleaner design, a Swiffer design, or even a design for a better hand towel would apparently expose the U.S. government and its citizens to exceptionally grave danger,' Wright said. But Wright added that he often discussed 'modern technological innovations' and the 'scientific wonders' of the Quran with Mohammed. He called Mohammed 'exceptionally intelligent.' 'If he had access to educational programs in Guantanamo Bay, such as distance learning programs, I am confident that in addition to furthering his Islamic studies, he could obtain a PhD in mechanical engineering, and very likely patent inventions,' Wright said. The CIA won't discuss Mohammed's vacuum plans, either. The AP asked the CIA for copies of the vacuum designs or any government records about them under the Freedom of Information Act. The CIA responded in a letter to the AP that the records, 'should they exist,' would be considered operational files of the CIA - among its most highly classified category of government files - and therefore exempt from ever being released to the public.","Khalid Sheikh Mohammed made request while detained by U.S. in Romania .

International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced the funding during a visit to Lebanon, which is in danger of being overwhelmed by the influx of people attempting to escape the bloodshed in neighbouring Syria. The £50 million will help meet emergency food and shelter needs for the 585,000 refugees already in Lebanon and will also be used to strengthen the infrastructure needed to cope with the exodus. Ms Greening said: 'The number of refugees in Lebanon looks set to double by Christmas. That means that a country half the size of Wales will be hosting over one million refugees. I pay tribute to the generosity of the Lebanese people but this is now a crisis for the region, not just for Syria, and we have got to deal with that reality. 'On top of that, a shocking one in 10 female refugees has suffered violence. I am determined that we must all do more to ensure that we do not lose sight of their particular needs in this wider crisis. Keeping people safe and preventing violence has to be a top priority.' The money comes from the £175 million to tackle the Syrian crisis announced by Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit last month. Lebanon now hosts more refugees as a percentage of the population than any other country in the world, with nearly 3,000 more arriving daily. This is creating tensions around the availability of housing and putting pressure on Lebanon's education and healthcare systems, as well as water, sanitation and other infrastructure.","Blast occurred this morning in area dominated by Lebanese Shi'ite Hezbollah .

The Russian business tycoon, who is known for his love of fast cars and private jets, also has a penchant for collecting superyachts. But as he can only use one at a time, Abramovich has decided to use the vessels as a cash cow and charter them out for an eye-watering figure - plus running costs.

Completed in 2010, the yacht has 18 cabins sleeping 34 guests, two helipads, a missile defence system and an accompanying submarine.

Carbonised coffee fused into these futuristic socks promises to spell the end to stinky feet as it filters and adsorbs sweat and odour. Ministry of Supply (MoS), who designed the garment, hope for £20,000 of funding but with more than two weeks to go until the opportunity to back them ends, they have already surpassed their goal four times over. Carbonised coffee granules in these futuristic socks attract odour particles for fresh feet . MoS' previous inventions include the £65 Apollo 2 dress shirt, a revolutionary garment that got widespread recognition. The shirt is made using anti-microbial fabric with moisture wicking qualities and NASA heat-regulation technology. The high-tech firm have now turned their hands to socks for their latest sartorial innovation. Named Atlas, . the firm once again evoke ancient Greece for the name of their . invention. The garment comes with a promise of cool and comfortable feet . thanks in part to coffee. The . socks are made from a mix of cotton, recycled polyester and carbonised . coffee which filters and absorbs sweat and odor to keep feet cool. MoS say that this is exactly how a Brita water filter works. Carbonised coffee 'attracts molecules' (composed mostly of carbon) with its spongy structure. The trepped . molecules are released in the wash, ready for a whole new dose of smells . the next time they're worn. The high-tech socks are part of a Kickstarter project reliant on funding . The . coffee is reclaimed from coffee roasting factories and shops and then subjected . to a pharmaceutical process to remove oils and that coffee . smell. It is then . infused into the company's recycled polyester yarns. Atlas has undergone lab tests that . MoS claims showed it to be three times more effective at absorbing . smells than regular cotton. The firm used 3D strain analysis to visualise how the skin stretches in 3D and adjusts, so that the sock doesn't have to bend and . stretch to accommodate foot movements as conventional socks do. They also used pressure mapping to . locate points that require extra support, a similar to technology used . in the production of customised orthotics. This technique combined with thermal imaging . identified hot spots and help improve ventilation. They 'hope to provide new levels of comfort that were not previously possible'. Pressure mapping combined with thermal imaging identified hot spots and help improve ventilation . Pressure mapping research has shown MoS how and where extra comfort is needed . The firm say the socks are durable, easily passing the eight month stress-test. Manufacturing . will be outsourced to specialist textile mills that use techniques such . as robotic knitting, which MoS says is like 3D printing but for . knitwear. MoS has poured as much clothing . technology into ATLAS as it can, even down to the robotic knitting . machines it uses to make the coffee socks. Robotic knitting machines are like 3D printers for clothing, and offers the same level of precision and customisation industry 3D printers provide. The sock project is now fully funded on Kickstarter four times over, so the MoS team's goal to product the garment in a variety of colours other than black is most likely to become a reality. The  Atlas performance dress socks, a 'Brita filter for your feet', will come in medium and large and will cost £18 for two pairs. The project is still open for funding on Kickstarter for another 15 days. Strain analysis maps the movement of the skin, and how clothing reacts when it's stretched over our foot .","Ministry of Supply have invented a sock that keeps feet fresh .

This is the first-ever confirmed picture of secretive graffiti artist Banksy - taken when he was an amateur footballer playing against Mexican freedom fighters. Before his rise to fame, the guerrilla artist was a goalkeeper for Bristol-based football club, Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls. In 2001 he joined them on a tour of Mexico where he played against Zapatista freedom fighters and painted them a mural depicting their struggle for independence. Elusive: The secretive artist Banksy pictured painting a mural while on a tour of Mexico with Bristol-based football club Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls . Hard at work: In a break between games with Zapatista freedom fighters, Banksy - who famously never reveals his face to the public - painted a mural depicting their struggle for independence . Undercover: Banksy's face has been pixelated in a new book 'Freedom Through Football: The Story of the Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls' to protect the artist's identity . Now images of the tour have been published for the first time in a new book - although the infamous artist’s face has been pixelated to protect his identity. However, it the first time a confirmed picture of the illusive Banksy has ever been printed despite years of speculation over his true identity. Club secretary Will Simpson said the artist began turning up to football sessions in the 1990s before he shot to fame. Ground-breaking: Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls sends teams of amateur footballers to play in troubled communities around the world . Political: The non-violent human right group, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, is fighting for freedom from the Mexican government . Getting involved: Banksy joined the club for a tour of Mexico in 2001 when he was in his late 20s . Mr Simpson said: 'He went on tour with us to Mexico in 2001 and painted a number of murals in the community. 'He came out with us on our second tour of Mexico - he did a few murals and played in goal for a bit. He wasn’t a bad goalie actually. New release: The Freedom Through Football: The Story of the Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls book featuring Banksy is now on sale . 'Shortly after he might have moved to London - we see him every so often when he comes back to Bristol.' The ground-breaking community football team was founded in the Easton area of Bristol, close to where Banksy grew up, in 1992. It prides itself as being 'Britain’s most intrepid sport club' and sends teams of amateur players to play in troubled communities all over the world. They were the first European team to play in the war-torn West Bank and in 2000 their cricket team played a two-day test against Compton Homies and Popz, in the crime-ridden area of Los Angeles. Mr Simpson said: 'The Cowboys is unique in that we don’t define ourselves as a socialist team or anarchist team, we are a sports team that has a political dimension. 'We’re anti-racist, anti-sexist, we’re against homophobia. We try to foster an inclusive atmosphere. 'Most football teams are 15 to 20 blokes but Cowboys and Cowgirls is a massive community. 'We have 200 people on the mailing list and about 150 people playing sports. 'We invite people of all backgrounds and abilities - you don’t have to play a sport to be part of Cowboys. 'Even if they cheer them from the touchline, we’ve lots and lots of non-playing cowboys and cowgirls.' Kicking up a storm: Club secretary of Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls, Will Simpson, said Banksy 'wasn't a bad goalie' Style: Banksy's sketches on the trip are done in his usual distinctive style . Fundraiser: Banksy has since helped raise more than £100,000 to support the club by donating artwork to be auctioned . Banksy joined them for a tour to Mexico in 2001 - when he was aged around 27 or 28 - where they played against the Zapatista Army of National Liberation. Led by the indigenous people of the Chiapas Mountains, the non-violent human rights group is fighting for freedom from the Mexican government. Since finding fame Banksy has helped raise over £100,000 to support the club, including donating artwork to auction and designing a T-shirt. He also donated a painting which was raffled off to raise money for water projects in a poor area of south-west Mexico. Mr Simpson added: 'He’s a nice bloke - . we still see him every now and again when he pops into The Plough when . he’s back in Bristol.' To . celebrate the club’s 20th anniversary, Mr Simpson and fellow Cowboy . Malcolm McMahon have written a book chronicling the club’s history and . featuring previously-unseen pictures. Going international: Images by the famous artist can now be spotted across random towns in Mexico . Fighting for freedom: Many of Banksy's murals have a political message attached to them . Banksy’s true identity has never been confirmed and no picture of him as ever been verified. He was originally believed to be a Robert or Robin Banks born in Yate near Bristol in the mid 1970s. In 2004 a picture emerged which reportedly showed Banksy working on an art project in Kingston, Jamaica, but it was denied by the artist himself. It has most recently been claimed that Banksy’s true identity is Robin Gunningham, a middle-class former public schoolboy from Bristol.

Millions of Europe's unemployed youth are moving to more wealthy countries in the European Union as they desperately try to find work. New figures have revealed that the number of Europeans who have moved to better off countries in the north to find work has doubled since the economic crises first hit four years ago, with Britain and Germany topping the list of choices. Almost a quarter of the EU's under 25s  - some 5.6million - are now unemployed. New figures have revealed that the number of Europeans who have moved to better off countries to find work has doubled to five million since the economic crises first hit four years ago, with Britain and Germany topping the list of choices. Millions of Europe's unemployed youth are moving to more wealthy countries in the European Union as they desperately try to find work . The figures have been revealed in the latest EU Employment and Social Situation review, published by the European Commission. Greeks, Bulgarians and Romanians are most likely to say they would like to move, according to the report. And it showed Britain was the top choice for foreign workers from the EU looking for employment last year, with 37 per cent migrating for these shores as they searched for work. Germany was next with 28 per cent. The two countries are by far the most popular destinations. Austria came third - but only saw six per cent of the total - and France came fourth with five per cent. The report said in 2008 the number of people stating they wanted to move for work -  the beginning of the EU wide recession - was two million. This year the figure tops five million. It said: 'Labour market and social challenges have been growing over recent months, as the EU is still faced with ever higher unemployment and the lowest employment figures since the onset of the crisis, according to the June edition of the EU Employment and Social Situation Quarterly Review. 'The situation of many households, and of young people in particular, remains serious.' 'The situation of young people remains grave, nearly a quarter of economically active young people in the EU being unemployed. Differences among countries are still substantial though.' The number of Europeans who have moved to better off countries in the north to find work has doubled since the economic crises first hit four years ago, with Britain and Germany topping the list of choices . Britain has actively tried to play down expectations of people planning a new life here from eastern and southern Europe. But Germany has actively attempted to lure promising workers from abroad after it decided to welcome well qualified workers from the south of Europe. Since the economic crises began, the country has seen the biggest increase in migration from other EU countries. In 2007, it saw 575,000 migrants. By 2011, that figure had increased to 842,000. The Times reports that demand for German language classes in southern Europe can barely be met. Manfred Ewel, director of the Goethe Institute in Madrid, said attendance at German classes had increased more than 70 per cent in three years. It comes after Brussels demanded Britain makes it easier for the unemployed from other European Union countries to find jobs here. The EU Commission said that while some states suffer ‘much higher’ levels of unemployment, the rest of the EU should open their doors and help. It wants new rules to force the Government to better advise migrants about their rights. They would also make it easier for unions and migrant groups to launch legal action if they think foreign workers are suffering discrimination. But Prime Minister David Cameron’s aim is to prevent a sudden influx to the UK when EU migration restrictions for Romanians and Bulgarians are lifted in January. In Britain, 4.8 per cent of the labour force – 1.4million people – is already made up of migrants from other EU nations. This compares with 4 per cent in Germany, and just 2.4 per cent in France. Demanding greater help for migrant workers, the EU employment and social affairs commissioner Laszlo Andor said in May: ‘The free movement of workers is a key principle of the EU’s single market. ‘With much higher levels of unemployment in some member states than others at the moment, it is all the more important to make it easier for those who want to work in another EU country to be able to do so.’","Almost a quarter of the EU's under 25s are unemployed - some 5.6million .

Unhappy: David Cameron believes the European Court of Human Rights is increasingly acting as a court of appeal against rulings that should be left to sovereign governments, a source claimed . Britain could leave the European Court of Human Rights if the Conservatives win the next election. Senior Tories are set to propose the radical plan after a series of controversial interventions from the Strasbourg court. David Cameron believes it is increasingly acting as a court of appeal against rulings that should be left to sovereign governments, a source claimed. Liberal Democrats are blocking an immediate exit, but plans for a withdrawal in the case of a Tory majority in 2015 could be published before next May’s European Parliament elections. This would leave British judges free to interpret the law without interference – and see final appeals heard in the UK Supreme Court, not the ECHR. This week, the European court prompted fury by ruling that whole-life jail terms with no possibility of review for murderers such as Jeremy Bamber amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. An earlier ruling, calling for Britain to give prisoners the vote, has been rejected by MPs. Home Secretary Theresa May has also blamed the ECHR for the delay in deporting hate preacher Abu Qatada. The ECHR’s backlog of 160,000 cases mean that an appeal against a British deportation judgment can delay someone’s removal by two years. Ministers say the ECHR has dangerously overreached its founding aim of protecting basic human rights abuses. Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit added: ‘There is only one way forward. First [Justice Secretary Chris] Grayling should tell the ECHR that the UK will ignore it. Plans: The Tories could leave the European Court of Human Rights if they win the next election .

An archaeologist who stole three 17th century relics found during excavation work on the site of a new shopping centre and tried to sell them on eBay has been spared jail. James Vessey, 35, took three 17th century Bellarmine vases while excavating earth for the SouthGate shopping centre in Bath, Somerset in 2008. But Vessey, who was employed by the Museum of London Archaeology to work on the dig, was caught when another archaeologist found the vessels, which date back to 1650, for sale on eBay last year. Historic find: PC Peter Hunt of Avon & Somerset Constabulary, left, returns two stolen 17 century vases to Stephen Clews from the Roman Baths in Bath. James Vessey admitted stealing them from an archaeological dig in 2008 . Stolen: The vases, which date back to 1650, were stolen from an archaeological dig ahead of work on a new shopping centre in Somerset . He was given a four month suspended sentence and ordered to carry out 270 hours of community service at Bath Magistrates Court after admitting the thefts. The court had heard that Vessey had a history of stealing historical artefacts from digs and had been jailed for a similar crime for 15 months in 2001. This time around he was spared a custodial sentence after the court heard that he was no longer working as an archaeologist and had been dealing with illness and the death of his parents. Avon & Somerset Constabulary PCs Peter Hunt and Gemma Kirby worked alongside the Museum of London Archaeology to identify the vases and where they came from. Police eventually carried out a raid on Vessey's Oxfordshire narrowboat home and he was arrested, Bath Magistrates Court heard. Andrea Edwards, prosecuting, said the crime 'cast suspicion over other archaeologists' and led to the loss of potentially significant historical evidence. The two PCs at the centre of the investigation have since presented two of the recovered vases to museum archaeologist Bruno Barber and Roman Baths manager Stephen Clews. Back in safe hands: Bruno Barber from the Museum of London Archaeology (far left) and Stephen Clews from the Roman baths (second right), gratefully receive the vases from PCs Peter Hunt and Gemma Kirby . The third vase is to follow. After further examination in London the vases will eventually be returned to the Roman Baths Museum. The vases, also known as Bartmann jugs, were traditionally used to protect against witchcraft. They originated particularly from the Cologne region of modern Germany. They were often decorated with a bearded face mask on the lower neck and came in a variety of sizes. They are named Bellarmine vases after Catholic cardinal Robert Bellarmine who was a fierce opponent of Protestantism in Germany and the low countries. It is unclear why his name became associated with the vases, but it may be connected to his anti-alcohol stance as the jugs were often used to store drink. Roman Baths manager Stephen Clews said: 'These vases are very important to us because we don't have many objects and artefacts from medieval Bath that give us a better picture of that period in the city's history.'","James Vessey stole three Bellarmine vases dating back to 1650 in 2008 .

But it doesn't take long for this racer to start clawing back some points - with its intuitive gameplay mechanics and balanced handling. Appearances can be deceiving: Don't be fooled, the Drive Club demo looked very different to this image . The playable gameplay demo was only 35 per cent complete and featured one track. Still, there's a remarkable sense of speed. Cars may not be the raw, overly-aggressive beasts that roamed GRID 2, but each one still has its own distinct character. While the sleek V10 Audi R8 glides gracefully through the corners, the Hennessey Venom GT, spits, hisses and charges through each turn with the elegance of a dumdum bullet. To stop races feeling stale, you can compete with friends during certain sections - be that to see who can achieve the best drift, or who can complete a certain section fastest. In time trials, they appear as ghosts so it helps you keep track of the competition. Sadly, for those hoping Drive Club's graphics would be a showcase of PS4's nuclear-powered hardware, you'd be sorely disappointed.

But don’t let its playful visuals fool you, because Puppeteer’s plot is actually rather dark. You play Kutaro, a young boy who gets his head ripped off by the Moon Bear King, a beast intent on capturing the souls of children to serve as puppet guards in his castle. Starring role: gameplay feels familiar to Little Big Planet, but there are enough changes to make it unique . Kutaro’s body is cast away but he soon finds a variety of different heads, each with their own abilities, and sets out on a mission to find his original head and return home. Levels see you guide Kutaro through a series of small acts, each one ending with a traditional curtain fall and quick stage reshuffle before starting again. There’s no ignoring the fact that it's cut from the same fine cloth as Little Big Planet. Take the real-time lighting, high-resolution textures and ‘that’ motion blur coating every act in a magical Hollywood sheen. But where LBP’s narrative felt somewhat tacked-on, Puppeteer’s intriguing story gives a sense of purpose to the campaign and stops it from feeling disjointed. Platforming sections are well thought-out, with the early demo suggesting gameplay is slightly more action-focused than LBG. Combat is more than just jumping on things. Evasion plays a key part in Kutaro’s armoury, however, a giant pair of scissors called Calibrus can be used to deal damage and snip away at different features of the environment. Then there are the different heads Kutaro acquires along the way, be that a skull – which, upon pressing down on the D-pad, makes you do a crazy dance to charm skeletons, or the spider, which can be used to open doors.

Crazy: Home Secretary Theresa May told the Commons today that the government would act to curb access to benefits, court appeals and legal aid for terror suspects . Terror suspects and hate preachers will be stripped of their benefits, Theresa May told the Commons yesterday. That was one of a series of lessons the Home Secretary vowed to learn from the twelve-year battle to deport Abu Qatada, whose family have received more than £500,000 since he arrived in Britain. The Home Secretary was cheered by Tory MPs as she confirmed that the fanatic had finally been put on a plane to Jordan. She told the House that Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith was already examining ‘how we can curtail the benefits claims made by terror suspects and  extremists whose behaviour is not conducive to the public good’. Hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza cost the taxpayer £338,000 before he was extradited to the USA last October and fellow hate-preacher Anjem Choudary, who gloated at the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, pockets an estimated £26,000 a year in benefits. Mrs May said she was determined to tackle the ‘crazy interpretation of our Human Rights laws’ that had allowed Qatada to frustrate the deportation process for so long. She said that the saga had cost taxpayers £1.7million. ‘That is not acceptable to the public, and it’s not acceptable to me,’ she added. ‘We must make sure it never happens again. ‘I have made clear my view that in the end the Human Rights Act must be scrapped.’ She said that the forthcoming immigration Bill would make it easier to remove foreign nationals and reduce their ability to prolong the process with ‘spurious appeals’. The Government has been trying to deport him to Jordan, where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999, for about a decade . Mrs May also suggested she wanted to . curb the availability of vast sums in legal aid that funded Qatada’s . battle to avoid deportation. She said that around £430,000 of Qatada’s . legal fees were paid by the taxpayer, while many other foreign nationals . the Government is trying to remove have their legal costs paid in full . by the public. Tory MP John Glen suggested Mrs May should go further and deport Qatada’s wife and five children. Mr Glen said: ‘It is indefensible that he and his family were able to . claim benefits for so long, and disappointing they were not on the plane . with him.’ Mrs May replied: ‘They will have a decision to make about where they see their future.’ But Mrs May reserved her fiercest criticism for the European Court of Human Rights, which she accused of ‘moving the goalposts’. ‘We must also consider our . relationship with the European Court very carefully, and I believe that . all options – including withdrawing from the Convention altogether – . should remain on the table,’ she said. Mrs May had been criticised by some . Conservative MPs for deferring to European Court judgments. Yesterday . she affirmed she had been right to do so, but acknowledged Qatada would . have been deported ‘long ago’ had the court not established ‘new, . unprecedented legal grounds’ to block it. Qatada was only deported after . Britain negotiated a treaty with Jordan guaranteeing that he would not . be subjected to torture and evidence obtained by torture would not be . used against him. He has been charged with plotting Al Qaeda-inspired terror attacks and detained in a prison in Jordan’s capital Amman. Charges faced by Qatada relate to a . foiled plot against the American school in Amman and an alleged attack . on Israeli and American tourists during New Year celebrations.

Microsoft liaised with the US intelligence services so they could access emails, including Hotmail, and listen in on Skype video calls. Officials at the software giant and the US National Security Agency collaborated to get around the company’s own encryption programmes, according to documents seen by the Guardian newspaper. The paperwork, provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden, apparently demonstrates the level of co-operation between Silicon Valley and the intelligence services over the past three years. Co-operation: Microsoft liased with US intelligence agencies so that they could spy on unsuspected people's emails, according to documents seen by The Guardian . They show that Microsoft helped the NSA intercept web chats and e-mail addresses including Hotmail and Outlook accounts. They also reveal the company worked with the FBI to allow the NSA easier access via the Prism program to the cloud storage  system SkyDrive, which has more than 250million users. And in July last year, nine months after Microsoft bought Skype, the NSA boasted that ‘a new capability’ had allowed it to  triple the amount of Skype video calls collected through Prism. Material collected through Prism is routinely shared both with the FBI and CIA and one NSA document even described the program as a ‘team sport’. Listening in: As well as emails, the documents suggest that Microsoft liased with intelligence services so that they could monitor Skype conversations . The revelations expose the extent of tensions between major tech firms in Silicon Valley and the Obama administration. The firms want to be allowed to speak openly about how much they co-operate with the NSA in order to placate their customers’ concerns over privacy. In private, they insist the access given to the US intelligence agencies is not one of collaboration but is driven by legal compulsion. Leak: The documents were provided to The Guardian by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden . Microsoft said: ‘When we upgrade or update products we aren’t absolved from the need to comply with existing or future lawful demands.’ But the company maintains it provides customer data ‘only in response to government demands and we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers.’ Since Prism's existence became public, Microsoft and other technology giants denied any knowledge of the programme.

David Miliband today admitted he can 'never erase' the memory of losing against his brother in their bitter struggle for the Labour leadership three years ago. But the former foreign secretary added his relationship with younger brother Ed is 'healing' and there was no point 'looking in the rear view mirror'. The ex-MP spoke candidly to veteran broadcaster Andrew Marr, who returned to his BBC show on Sunday, just six months after suffering a stroke. Hard to forget: David Milliband (right) has admitted he can 'never erase' the memory of losing against his brother, Ed during the 2010 Labour leadership contest . The interview was Mr Miliband's last before he moves to New York to head up the International Rescue Committee charity. Although he did not completely rule out a comeback, he added that leaving British politics would ensure an end to the 'soap opera' of the brothers' rivalry. Mr Miliband said: 'The truth is I did not think I would be in this position.But I am now, I'm excited, I am engaged. Of course I am sad to go, but I am excited by the challenge ahead.' He added: 'These things, you can never erase them from memory or history. 'But Ed and I are brothers for life. That is something that you value and that you nurture whatever the difficulty of the circumstances.' Asked if his relationship with Ed was 'healing', Mr Miliband replied: 'Of course.' Comparing the brothers to Wimbledon tennis finalists Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, he continued: 'The important thing though is that you've got to never lead your life by looking in the rear view mirror. 'You can't afford to end up eating yourself up with that kind of struggle. 'You've got to try and say, there are the Murrays of this world who win and there are the Djokovics who come second. You've got to be gracious when you don't win.' Sibling love: David Miliband (right) said he and Ed are 'brothers for life' and that their relationship is 'healing' Mr Miliband also rejected the idea that Britain was entering a period where the only governments would be coalitions. 'I think the conventional assumption that we are bound to get a coalition is wrong,' he said. 'In the end the British people will take a view and I think that is a great prize for Labour. The danger is that could be a great prize for the Tories as well. 'Remember, the polls are meaningless at this stage because they start with the question: 'How would you vote if there was an election tomorrow?' 'There isn't an election tomorrow. People will come to a judgement about the future of the country in two years' time, and I would say it is all to play for, it is open. 'I don't think anyone on either side should be banking on the fact that it is bound to be a coalition. 'I don't see it that way.'

"PUBLISHED: . 06:03 EST, 5 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:07 EST, 5 July 2013 . Apple has filed a patent for a pair of headphones that automatically adjust the volume of music if they're not inserted far enough into the ear. The tech company has been criticised in the past for the headphones it sells with iPhones and iPods because they 'leak' music, meaning a listener's tunes can be heard by people around them. Designs for the in-ear headphones, also known as earbuds, in this latest patent have a built-in microphone that can assess how much much music is leaking and adjust the volume accordingly. This image, taken from the recently filed Apple patent, shows how the new earbuds would work. When inserted into the ear, a built-in microphone assesses how much music is leaking in and out. If the seal between the bud and the ear canal is broken, the volume will be automatically adjusted accordingly . When inserted into the ear, a built-in microphone assesses how much music is leaking in and out. It also checks for ambient and background noises. If the seal between the bud and the ear canal is broken - determined by whether the microphone can pick up a lot of background noise - the volume of the music will be automatically adjusted accordingly. Alternatively, a warning message will appear on the screen to tell the listener their music isn't at the optimum level. According to the patent, the buds could track variations in the seal between the speaker section of the earbud and the wearer's ear canal. If the earbud is not inserted far enough, the microphone will realise the seal has been broken. The buds will then either warn the listener through an on-screen message, or automatically adjust the volume. The microphone can also listen to ambient noises and increase the volume if the wearer is in a loud environment. This adjustment additionally means the earbuds will better fit people's different sized ears. The patent was filed earlier this month to the U.S Patent and Trademark Office and it will need to be approved before Apple can begin working on, and ultimately selling, the device. It said: 'The speakers in earbud headphone are encased in earbuds. The headphones Apple released with early versions of its iPhones and iPods, pictured, didn't fit in the ear properly and customers complained they 'leaked' music. This meant people around them could hear what they were listening to . 'During use, the earbuds are placed in the ears of a user. When properly seated in the user's ear, the earbuds form a seal. 'If the seal between the earbuds and the user's ear is formed correctly, music can be played back satisfactorily. In September 2012, Apple released its EarPods, pictured. They were designed to fit more snugly in the ear in a bid to reduce noise leakage. However, customers complained they were uncomfortable . 'Poor seals can adversely affect performance. For example, noise cancellation operations can be degraded and volume levels can be affected.' Explaining how its earbud design would prevent this, Apple adds: 'In response to measured reductions in seal quality, actions may be taken such as generating informative messages for the user, increasing overall earbud volume, correcting mismatched balance between left and right earbuds, adjusting equalization settings, and making adjustments to noise cancellation circuitry.' DisplaySearch analyst Paul Grey told Stuff magazine: 'Apple must be careful not to invade or choke off its accessories market – they’ve never made great headphones or accessories.' The headphones Apple released with the early versions of its iPhones and iPods didn't fit in the ear properly and were renowned for 'leaking' music. In September 2012, Apple released its EarPods which were first shipped with the iPhone 5. They were designed to fit more snugly in the ear in a bid to reduce noise leakage. However, customers complained that they were uncomfortable and still didn't fit properly.","Patent filed for a new design of in-ear headphones, known as earbuds .

Scientists have revealed the key to predicting climate change - and it lies in the excrement produced by earthworms. Researchers from the University of York and . the University of Reading discovered that earthworm faeces - also known as casting - contain tiny granules of calcite. After keeping different earthworms at different temperatures, they were able to prove that these granules retain a 'memory' of the temperature of the air in which they are excreted. This means that by studying fossilised samples of earthworm poo and testing the residual temperature of the granules inside, scientists can now track changes in the Earth's climate over thousands of years. Researchers from York and Reading universities have discovered the tiny granules of calcite found in the faeces of earthworms, pictured, retain the outside temperature at the time it's excreted. By studying fossilised samples of this casting, scientists can track how the Earth's climate has changed over the years . The small lumps of chalk-like material and their change in temperature can then be used to predict future climate trends. In the study, published in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, researchers said the lumps appear to be uniquely marked by whatever temperatures they encountered in the surrounding environment at the time the worm excreted them. The researchers proved this by keeping the earthworms at different temperatures. Isotopic testing . - a test which monitors the movement and in turn the temperature of molecules - was then carried out on the calcite granules in each earthworm's casting to discover that the different granules retained the temperature at which they were formed. Tiny granules of calcite, similar to the one pictured, are found in earthworm casting. It retains the temperature of the air around it and can be used to track changes in the Earth's climate . Principal investigator Prof Mark Hodson, of the University of York’s environment department, said: 'There are many conflicting theories about why earthworms produce calcite granules, but until now, the small lumps of chalk-like material found in earthworm poo have been seen as little more than a biological curiosity. 'However, our research shows they may well have an important role to play, offering a window into past climates.' Lead author Dr Emma Versteegh, from the department of geography and environmental science at the University of Reading, added: 'This knowledge about past climates is of vital importance for developing and benchmarking climate models that make predictions for the future. 'These chalk balls will allow us to reconstruct temperatures for specific time intervals in which they were formed.' University of Reading Professor of archaeology Stuart Black said: 'We believe this new method of delving into past climates has distinct advantages over other biological proxies. 'For example, we believe it will work for the full seasonal range of temperatures.' The researchers are now collecting samples from archaeological sites dating back thousands of years to build up a picture of past climates and how the future climate will develop. Dr Stuart Black, from the University of Reading’s Department of Archaeology, added: 'We believe this new method of delving into past climates has distinct advantages over other biological proxies. 'For example, we believe it will work for the full seasonal range of temperatures, whereas methods such as tree rings, do not 'record' during winter. 'In addition, because the chalk balls are found in direct context with archaeological finds, they will reveal temperatures at the same location.'","Experts monitored the faeces of earthworms kept at different temperatures .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . PUBLISHED: . 12:10 EST, 3 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:13 EST, 3 July 2013 . A person's view on whether climate change is real or not can be swayed by something as simple as what date they are asked and if the weather is expected for that time of year, a scientist has claimed. Professor Nick Chater, from Warwick Business School, claims that if someone is questioned about climate change on a day in June when it is colder than expected, or raining, they will be more sceptical. Alternatively, if they are asked on a winter's day when the sun is shining they're more likely to believe the phenomenon exists. Some people believe that climate change and global warming is causing the ice caps to melt, pictured, while others deny it exists. A professor from Warwick Business School has now claimed that a person's opinion about climate change can be swayed depending on when in the year the question is asked, the weather, and even what is immediately around them . Chater calls this behaviour 'attribute substitution' and says that it can be applied to other complex issues, too. In the first episode from series two of BBC Radio 4’s The Human Zoo, Chater discusses how people look to find simple shortcuts in things they can see, and their surrounding environment, to solve complex issues, such as the debate around climate change. Attribute substitution – where a person replaces a complicated question that needs a judgement with a more easily calculated attribute – underlies these shortcuts. 'When you look at the climate change argument you can see this at play,' said Professor Chater, of Warwick Business School. 'A recent large scale web survey on a single day across the world asked the question ‘just how much do you believe that climate change is real?’' 'It wanted to see how much that judgment was affected by whether the temperature of the particular location was hotter or colder than average for that time of the year. Research from the Warwick Business School also found that people who are shown the same graph or climate change image, pictured, will interpret it differently, depending on their viewpoint. Believers will read into changes and lines, while sceptics will play them down - even if the line is based on factual data . The research found that if it is hotter than average on the day someone is asked, then the participant is more likely to believe there is such a thing as climate change. Whereas, if it is a colder than average day they tended to be more sceptical. 'It indicates we are being pushed around by very immediate things, like what we see when we look out the window,' added Chater. A separate experiment on students at Warwick Business School showed how the same data could be interpreted differently by those who believe in climate change and those that don’t. Professor Nick Chater claims that people use 'attribute substitution' as a way of using things around them to influence their decisions on complex debates - such as climate change endangering polar bears - so they don't have to think too hard . 'We gave them a graph with a wiggly line on it and asked the students to continue it in the way that seemed most natural,' said Chater. 'We then gave them another wiggly line, but this time it was real data plotting the average global temperature from 1880 to 2010, and told them it was a climate change prediction task and to guess how that graph would continue. 'Then on a scale of one to seven we asked them how worried they were by climate change.' 'We found that if somebody thinks climate change is real, they tend to extrapolate upwards in temperature more than people who have the opposite view. 'That is true when they think the data is about climate change but not true when they see the wiggly pattern has no particular meaning. 'And when people are more sceptical they tend to keep the line flatter.' 'It shows it is very hard for us to look at data in a dispassionate way. 'When we consider how data is going to continue we think both about what it shows so far but also what our general knowledge or beliefs tell us.There is a danger it can mean the data can look different depending on your perspective. 'If I am a climate change sceptic I might look at the same data and think that doesn’t show much of a trend upwards, but somebody who strongly believes in climate change might look at the same data and see a much more alarming trend.' When faced with complex issues, finding shortcuts like attribute substitutions is, Professor Chater adds, a perfectly rational thing to do. 'Attribute substitution is part of a more general tendency to find short-cuts to difficult problems and that gets you quite a long way,' said the Professor of Behavioural Science. 'If you are wondering how large a city is you might think it is famous, it has an enormous river flowing through it, a well-known football team and so think it is a large city. 'It is using available simple information to solve a difficult problem and on the whole that works pretty well. 'We live in an enormously complex world so theses simplifications and short-cuts are essential, even though they produce biases, they allow us to work and behave.'","Professor Nick Chater, from Warwick Business School, believes a person's view on climate change can differ from one day to the next .

Alive: After a four-hour search, 6-year-old Nathan Woessner was found alive by excavators at Indiana Dunes National Park . What started off as a fun summer afternoon at the beach turned into a nightmare when 6-year-old Nathan Woessner was swallowed into a sinkhole and disappeared beneath the sand. After a four-hour search that many rescuers believed had turned into a recovery mission, they found the Sterling, Illinois boy alive but unconscious. As of Sunday he was in critical condition at Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago, but he is expected to make a full recovery. Woessner was visiting Mt Baldy at the Indiana Dunes National Park with his family Friday when he fell into the sinkhole. Apparently the boy had been playing in an area that had been roped off, authorities said. His family didn't see him swallowed into the hole, but heard his screams and ran over to the scene. Woessner's father and a family friend attempted to dig the boy out but the boy just kept sinking deeper. They called 911, and a rescue crew of 50 firefighters and private contractors were sent to the dunes with excavation equipment. It was a race against time, according to firefighter Brad Kreighbaum, the team was losing hope fast. 'We tried to just stay focused,' Kreighbaum told WSBT. 'The first two hours was complete misery.' Rescue effort: It look an army of 50 firefighters and private contractors to find the boy buried under 14 feet of sand . Finally after four hours they located the boy. At around 8 p.m. they found Woessner completely immersed in sand and unconscious when they pulled him out, so they feared for the worst. It was only when the boy was on the way to the hospital, that rescuers got word back at the site that the boy was conscious - breathing, bleeding and crying. Found him! Finally the rescuers found Woessner and quickly transported him to a Chicago hospital for treatment . Dig faster: Rescuers were scared that the boy wouldn't be alive by the time they got to him . 'It went from a very grave situation to...it couldn't have worked any better,' Kreighbaum said. Rescuers hope to meet the boy when he is better again. 'I really hope we get to meet this young man because he's extraordinary. He went through a lot'  Ryan Miller of D&M Excavating said. Responding: When rescuers first pulled the boy out, he was unconscious. But they later learned that he was breathing and crying while on the way to the hospital . Recovering: Woessner is in critical condition still, but hasn't sustained any life-threatening injuries or brain injuries despite the lack of oxygen . Woessner was transported to Comer Children's Hospital and his parents are 'upbeat and hopeful' he will pull though, Michigan City Police Chief Mark Swistek told The News-Dispatch. Miraculously the boy hasn't sustained any life-threatening injury or brain injury from the lack of oxygen, according to Michigan City Fire Department spokesman Mark Baker. The park will remain closed until officials and determine what caused the sinkhole and if it's safe, opening it at earliest on Monday.

A 71-year-old man who lost the will to live after his wife and four-year-old daughter were tragically killed in one of the most extraordinary tragedies of the 9/11 terrorist attacks has died of cancer. David McCourt died on Thursday after a long battle against metastatic melanoma with his much younger second wife, Mary Bryant McCourt, by his side. While McCourt slowly managed to rebuild his life after losing wife Ruth McCourt, 45, and their daughter Juliana, 4, in 2001, he was initially consumed by a powerful depression - partly owing to the horrific set of coincidences around his family's death. Tragic: David McCourt has tragically died of cancer, years after admitting he wanted to end his own life after his wife and daughter were killed on 9/11 . Ruth was on her way to Disneyland with daughter Juliana and best friend of more than a decade, Paige Farley Hackel, when tragedy struck. The trio was traveling to Boston's Logan International Airport to begin a vacation in Southern California. But the best friends couldn't get seats on the same plane. Hackel, 46, left first on American Airlines Flight 11, while Ruth and Juliana boarded United Airlines Flight 175. Both of these planes were hijacked by terrorists who flew them into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. 'This is all completely appropriate,' Ruth's mother, Paula . Scott, told the Sun Sentinel at the time. 'I knew that if one of them had to go, both of them would have to . go. And now our families have come together.' But in a further bizarre twist, Ruth's brother Ronald Clifford was standing outside the World Trade Center - there for a business meeting - and watched as the plane carrying his sister and niece crashed into the south tower. 'It was an incredible nightmare,' Clifford told the Mirror. 'I went into therapy immediately because I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t close my eyes.' When he returned home to New Jersey that day, he realized it was likely his family members were on that flight.

Clifford said he didn't think David McCourt would ever get over the tragic death - neither did David. In January 2002, the widower said he had considered suicide. 'Ruth and Juliana were my life and my passion,' he told an audience at a New London synagogue. 'I . was going to end it all. If faith could justify taking these two . beautiful creatures, I just didn't want to go on. But something kept me . going. 'It's been a journey of spiritual awakening to go from where I was. 'If you don't have the spiritual awakening, you don't survive.' But McCourt did eventually find the strength to move on. He helped found B.R.A.V.E. Juliana, a program of HELP USA, to teach nonviolence and conflict resolution to children. He said his wife and daughter died because some countries teach their children to hate. 'What we have do is to start with the children in this country and teach them tolerance, compassion and understanding,' McCourt said in 2002. A garden on the grounds of New London's Lyman Allyn Art Museum was established to honor the memories of Juliana and Ruth McCourt. David McCourt called it a 'metaphor for seasons and renewal and healing for those who are left behind'. New love: David McCourt, left, married second wife Mary Bryant McCourt, a former Ford model, in 2011 . New life: David McCourt, left, married second wife Mary Bryant, right, in 2011 . McCourt later retired to Florida and married second wife Mary Bryant McCourt, several years his junior, in 2011. Mary had her own story of tragedy, according to Palm Beach Daily News. At 14, she became a top Ford Model, and had a masectomy in her 30s after being diagnosed with breast cancer. But six days after her fifth round of chemotherapy, she ran the New York Marathon. Her brother Don, a quadriplegic, made history when he ran the New York Marathon by pushing his head back in a power chair. This led her to found the Achilles Freedom Team of Wounded Veterans. Not long after 9/11, her brother Don died and she met her future husband David. They 'overcame their difficulties together'.","David McCourt died of cancer more than a decade after wife, Ruth, and daughter, Juliana, were killed when their plane crashed into the World Trade Center on 9/11 .

CBS has responded to the growing controversy over racist and homophobic statements made by several 'Big Brother' contestants that were captured on the reality show's live Internet feed.

After warning her not to flip her mattress again, Gries responded back in a 'black' accent mocking the African-American Stewart. 'Whatchu gon' do gurl...whatchu gon' do? Class girl. Where's yo class?' Aaryn mocked. And not to be outdone by her friend, GinaMarie Zimmerman piped in with more racism. As Candice was getting worked up, GinaMarie confronted her saying: 'You want the black to come out?'

When Contessa Riggs saw her older brother swim away from their boat that had capsized in the choppy waters off the coast Maryland to get help, she thought he had a 50-50 chance to make to ashore – but he was far less optimistic. In a phone interview with MailOnline Saturday afternoon, the 43-year-old Washington DC resident said that her heroic sibling later revealed to her that he thought he only had about 30 per cent chance to reach dry land alive. But John Franklin Riggs plowed ahead anyway, believing that it was the only way to save his sister, elderly father, 3-year-old nephew and 9-year-old niece, who were left clinging to the overturned boat in the gathering darkness following a thunderstorm Tuesday. Hero: 46-year-old John Riggs (right), of Salisbury, swam five hours against strong waves in the middle of a storm for help . Survivors: The family, including 3-year-old Conrad (left) and 9-year-old Emily (right), spent more than eight hours bobbing in the jellyfish-infested water . Patriarch: John Riggs, a 70-year-old retired commercial waterman from Salisbury, organized the fishing trip . Ill-fated vessel: The Riggs family headed off on a fish trip aboard their 16-foot Carolina Skiff . After . swimming for about five hours, Mr Riggs was able to climb ashore and . get help, leading rescuers to his family stranded in the middle of the . jellyfish-infested Tangier Sound. Miss . Riggs said that aside for a few stings and some scrapes and bruises, . the entire family is doing well as they continue to recover from the . terrifying ordeal. Her . 3-year-old son, Conrad, is still thinking about the accident and had a . nightmare recently, but the mother said that the toddler is eager to go . fishing again. Since . Tuesday, John Franklin Riggs, 46, has been hailed a hero by national . media outlets for his bravery, but according to his sister, he doesn’t . think he had done anything extraordinary. ‘He is a very modest and shy sort of guy,’ she explained. ‘He shakes his head a lot.’ The . Riggs family and Contessa's 9-year-old niece visiting from California . were out fishing for croaker off Deal Island, Maryland, Tuesday. They . were about five hours into their outing and nearly ready to head home . when a sudden thunderstorm descended on the area, churning the waters in . Tangier Sound. Their boat was only 16 feet long, and Miss Riggs, who has been fishing in these parts for a decade, immediately knew they were in trouble. ‘We took a wave over the stern, and I saw the water and went and grabbed a life jacket for my niece,’ she recalled. At . that point, their small vessel may have had a chance to recover if not for the two additional waves that overwhelmed the boat, . flipping it over. Miss Riggs just had enough time to put a life preserve . over her toddler son. Rescued: Emily, 9, was among those saved from a capsized boat . Mortal danger: Contessa Riggs was especially worried about her elderly father (left), who wears a pacemaker, and the young children on board . Man on a mission: John Riggs swam for five and a half hours to shore to raise the alarm and get help . When their boat capsized, Riggs' brother and father swam under to get lifejackets for the rest of the . family, which ultimately has proven to be a life-saving move. Miss . Riggs was especially concerned for her 70-year-old father, who has a . pacemaker, and the two young children in their care, so she made sure . they stayed close to the overturned boat. The . 16-foot-long Carolina Skiff dubbed Bathtub, which belongs to Miss . Riggs' father, capsized about 2 miles off the coast and then drifted . about 5 miles in a parallel direction when the tide turned. At . first, the 43-year-old mother said that the water felt fairly warm and even . 'nice,' with only jellyfish and sea nettles pestering the family. But as it grew darker, the stinging critters became the least of their . worries. ‘The bigger problem was the cold, and we were just shivering and shivering,’ Contessa Riggs recalled in the interview. The . area is also a known habitat of the small but aggressive bull sharks, . but Miss Riggs said she tried not to think of that while bobbing in the . water. John . and Contessa Riggs' father, also named John, is a 70-year-old retired commercial . waterman from Salisbury, Maryland, who organized the fishing trip for . his children and grandchildren, 3-year-old Conrad Drake, and 9-year-old . Emily Horn, a fourth-grader visiting from San Francisco. Near tragedy: The boat overturned two miles from short. After calling 911, John Riggs went on a rescue boat with volunteer firefighters to find his family in the pitch black . As time passed and the temperature of . the water dropped, Miss Riggs noticed that her young son was dozing off . and shivering uncontrollably. ‘At one moment I was terrified he was going to die in . my arms,’ the mother said of little Conrad. Riggs knew that nobody was going . to start looking for them until the next day, so she and John decided . that their best chance for survival was to go out for help. 'John . and I looked at each other and he said, ""Should I try it?"" I knew he . was talking about swimming to shore. So I told him to try it. But we had . no idea if he would make it to shore,' she added. Defiant: Miss Riggs said that her young son Conrad is eager to go back into the water . Ironically, . Contessa said that her brother, who works as a commercial fisherman, . does not like swimming and is not good at it. Thankfully, the . 46-year-old had a life jacket on, which helped him stay afloat as he . slowly made his way towards the shore. But . as minutes turned into hours and the water grew even colder, the mother . became fearful that she would never see John again. To make matters . worse, Contessa Riggs saw that her elderly father was getting weaker. ‘I started to think there’s going to be a double funeral,’ she said. After swimming for five hours, the 46-year-old finally made it to dry land. 'John made it to the beach but he was so tired, he could not walk. So he crawled to the nearest house he saw. Luckily they had dogs, which woke the family up. And even luckier for us, that family had the personal number for the fire chief,' Riggs told ABC 2 News station Friday. While waiting for rescue, Miss Riggs was doing her best to keep everyone's spirits up by being positive. To stop the kids from crying, she would chat with them about the first thing they would like to do the following day and prattle on about trivial things like eating ice cream and watching movies. When her 9-year-old niece turned fearful, saying that they will never make it home, Miss Riggs would reassure her that help was on the way. It was as they were talking that she noticed lights in the horizon. ‘My first thought was, ‘Thank God, they’re going to find us,”’ Riggs recalled Saturday. Back on dry land: On the boat were Riggs' 70-year-old father, a 9-year-old niece, Riggs' sister, Contessa Riggs, . and her 3-year-old son . Initially, however, the first rescue . boat that made it into the sound did not notice the family in the water . and overshot them, not realizing that they had drifted from the location . of the capsizing. ‘They did another loop, and that was just devastating,’ she recalled. The . stranded family tried to attract the attention of the rescuers by . screaming and waving, but the genies of their boats drowned out their . desperate cries for help. Finally, . a Maryland State Police helicopter hovering overhead shone a spotlight . on the small group of people huddling around the overturned boat, . guiding the rescuers to them. 'There . were a few storms in the area, and the boat turned upside down,' said . Sgt. Brian Albert at the Maryland Natural Resources Police. 'Mr. Riggs . swam to shore. These people are very lucky. No one was injured.' Firefighters from Deal Island, Mount Vernon and Fairmount in . Somerset County and Westside in Wicomico County pulled alongside. The . U.S. Coast Guard also was on the scene, Mr Albert said. Desperate measures: John Franklin Riggs (right) was unable to walk when he came ashore, so he had to crawl for help . Optimist: Determined to keep the children calm, Contessa Riggs kept repeating that help was on the way . Helpless: Contessa Riggs later recalled how her toddler son (pictured) cried and and shivered next to her in the frigid water . Volunteer firefighters pulled Riggs . and her family onto a boat but it was only until they were taken to a . second boat that she was reunited with her brother. 'It was the most amazing feeling. I ran up to John and said, 'You are my hero,' Contessa told ABC after the rescue. 'I'm so grateful to the first . responders that came and helped us out. I was so happy to see them and I . love all of them. And I am so proud of my family, especially my . brother. We survived together.' Speaking . to MailOnline Saturday, Contessa said, ‘we were extremely, extremely . lucky. It took us hours and hours to get warm again.’ John . Riggs Sr’s boat has since been pulled out of the water and transported . back to his yard. His daughter said that it is in good condition, but she . will likely stay away from it – at least this summer.","Fishing party consisted of John Franklin Riggs, his sister Contessa Riggs, her 70-year-old father, 3-year-old son and 9-year-old niece .

Loor's . alleged assailant, who suffers from schizophrenia and a bi-polar . ordered, has been charged with attempted aggravated murder, assault and . criminal possession of a weapon, according to CBS New York. This past March, the courageous cop was promoted to detective, but his injuries have left him unable to continue his service. Her husband's extremely close call, followed by a slow recovery, has not deterred Mrs Loor from pursuing her dream of joining the force. If anything, the ordeal has steeled her resolve to join the force. ‘After my education at John Jay College, I would say that I wanted to pursue this career more than I’ve ever anticipated,’ she told the New York Post. ‘I have passion for the law and to enforce it and to protect the community as well.’ The new recruit said that her husband stands behind her decision. ‘He’s always telling me to follow my heart and this is where my heart has been,’ she said. Passing the baton: Eder Loor (left) has been unable to continue his service on the force due to his injuries, but he has been supportive of Dina's plan to pursue a career in law enforcement . Happy family: The Loors have two young kids, a 6-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy . Mrs Loor added that her spouse has offered her some words of advice as she embarks on her risky career path, namely to always be alert and ready, and to trust her partner. The aspiring cop said that her 6-year-old daughter was excited to learn that she is going to be a police officer. The Loors also have a 2-year-old son. Mrs Loor said she is grateful to the NYPD for the support the agency has shown her. The recruit is one of 225 women joining the Police Academy. On Friday, the 27-year-old and her fellow probationary officers will report to the New York City Police Academy in Manhattan to begin their training.","Officer Eder Loor was stabbed in left temple with 3-and-a-half-inch knife in April 2012 .

A mother-of-three who suffers with a condition that causes her muscles to pulsate, swell and stiffen like that of the Incredible Hulk has left doctors baffled. Helen Stephens, 50, from Wednesbury in the West Midlands, has suffered with a debilitating yet undiagnosable condition for the past 14 years and has been left bedbound and unable to look after herself. Her condition - which she likens to having red hot pokers placed under her skin -  has worsened in recent months and she is frightened that one day the spasms will become so violent that they will kill her. Helen Stephens, 50, suffers with an undiagnosable condition that causes her muscles to spasm, stiffen and swell. She has deteriorated in recent months, with chest pain causing her worry that that condition may kill her if she does not receive appropriate treatment soon . She has already started to develop chest pains when she suffers a flare-up and she is worried that she will be left unable to breathe or have a heart attack. Ms Stephens is the subject of a Channel 5 documentary which follows her journey to get a definitive diagnosis. Until she is formally diagnosed, doctors are unable to treat the root cause of her frightening condition. For years doctors believed she . suffered with a very rare condition called Stiff Person Syndrome, but . tests have been unable to confirm this. Agony: In the Channel 5 documentary, Ms Stephens undergoes rigorous testing. Doctors originally believed she has Stiff person Syndrome, but test results have all come back negative . Last year Ms Stephen's spasms caused her muscles to build up and swell so much that she put on five stone and her neck swelled by four inches. She said that one of the things she hates the most about the condition is the lack of control she has over her life . But recently a more sensitive . test, which can pick up even trace amounts . of the the antibodies responsible for the condition, has become available. In the documentary, Ms Stephens . visits consultants at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham as well experts at . the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford to undergo eight days of rigorous . testing. Last year Ms . Stephen's spasms caused her muscles to build up and swell so much that . she put on five stone and her neck swelled by four inches. Before developing the mystery condition, Ms Stephens had a succesful career as a social worker and was a busy mother-of-three. Since 1999 however she has deteriorated and for the past seven years she has been confined to a padded bed to ensure she does not hurt herself when she suffers the debilitating muscle spasms . The mystery condition can flare up at any moment and an episode can last anything from a few minutes to over an hour. She said: 'When I have a . bad attack I swell up like the Hulk. I look enormous and I even call . myself the Hulk, Arnie (Arnold Schwarzenegger) or Rambo. I’m like a . bodybuilder.' Although it has never been proven, Ms Stephens blames a car accident in 1999 for the development of her condition. Within a short space of time, the paralysing shudders left her . unable to wash, eat or bathe without help and for the past seven years . she has been confined to a darkened room. An episode of the muscle stiffening can occur at any time. Ms Stephens says that stress, loud noises and even certain foods can trigger an attack. For many years people simply believed she was a hypochondriac . She said: ‘Everyday I wake up to the same . thing. It's like being in a coffin. Anything can trigger me to become . stiff – the cold and stress are the big ones.' Ms Stephens said that many people simply believed that she was a hypochondriac when she first sought medical help. But in 2004, . specialists diagnosed her with Stiff Person . Syndrome and have since managed her symptoms with tranquilisers. Ms Stephens likens her symptoms to those of the Incredible Hulk . In the documentary her consultant explained that most people require just 10mg of diazepam to make them relaxed enough to undergo an uncomfortable procedure such as an endoscopy, but that Ms Stephens is on 30mg, four times a day. This, he said, is enough to knock out 12 people. Ms Stephens said: 'My muscles tear at the same time and they increase in mass meaning my weight balloons. 'If . I don’t get an injection of diazepam quickly enough my whole body . stiffens, leaving me unable to have any treatment because a needle will . just snap. Two weeks after undergoing testing, Ms Stephens receives her results and the documentary finally reveals whether or not Ms Stephens suffers with Stiff Person Syndrome. They say that even if they are not able to confirm what is wrong with her, the results will be helpful because it means that they can investigate other causes of the condition and try out other treatments.","Helen Stephens, 50, has suffered excruciating spasms for the past 14 years .

Missing: Terry Dewayne Smith Jr went missing Saturday night while his step-brother was babysitting and his body was found on Wednesday . A psychic has revealed that she was the one to help police discover the body of the autistic 11-year-old boy in a shallow grave near his home after he had been missing for three days. The woman's vision reportedly led her to the area about 100 feet from Terry Dewayne Smith Jr.'s mother's home in Menifee, California where they found the boy's body buried. Riverside County Sheriff's Detective John Powers confirmed to a local radio station that Ms Ragland did play a pivotal role in helping them find the boy's body. Mr Powers says Ragland called a tip line about her vision, and was invited to join the search. He says Ragland and her children came to the house without knowing it was the boy's, walked on to the property and right to the partially buried body. Mr Powers says he searched the area previously himself without seeing it. This revelation comes the same day that the boy's father, who lives in West Virginia, said that Terry was not autistic and that he had spoken to him before he disappeared when the boy asked him if he could go visit. The 11-year-old had lived with his father, Terry Smith Sr., in West Virginia up until 2001 when he went to live with his mother Shawna in California. Shawna now lives in Menifee with her longterm lesbian partner, Denise, and her son from a different relationship. That 16-year-old boy, Terry's . half-brother, has been charged with the murder and now a hearing will be . held to see if he will be tried as an adult or a child. Vision: Pam Ragland was volunteering during the search for the missing boy and had a 'knowing' of where she should go to look for the body . Near home: The boys lived with their mother and her partner in the home center right, and Terry's body was found in a shallow grave by the tree back to the left, only 100 feet away . Police have not released any official . motive for the alleged murder, but psychic Pam Ragland said that she had . a bad feeling about the half-brother. Ms Ragland, who lives in Los Angeles, was driving around Menifee with her . children in the car as they helped look for the missing boy. She told NBC Los Angeles that she had a very specific dream about the boy's whereabouts. 'I . had this knowing that he was in a certain direction and whichever way I . would turn I would know which direction to go,' she said. Arrested: Terry's half-brother, seen here, has not been publicly identified but was taken in by police on Wednesday on suspicion of Terry's murder. He was formally charged with the crime on Friday . 'That's . the building I saw in my vision, and it was very distinctive and it was . like this- it's giving me chills to even think about it now- it was . like this open tack shed.' They . went towards a fenced-in area near a tree behind the family's home and . she 'something that smelled dead'. Minutes later they spotted the top of . Terry's head poking out of the shallow grave. Police . are still investigating the case and determining the charges that they . will press against the teenage half-brother, but for now the family is . asking for privacy. 'Everybody . has known Terry, if they're lucky, for five minutes; we've known him . for 11 years and we have 11 years of grieving to do,' Shawna's partner . Denise said. Reeling: Denise (pictured), Terry's mother's longterm lesbian partner, said that the family is grieving . Heartbroken: The boy's father, Terry Smith Sr (pictured), is a retired truck driver who lives in West Virginia and he said that- in spite of Shawna's claims- he did not believe his son was autistic . Shawna initially described Terry Jr. as an autistic boy who took special medication and answered only to his nickname, 'JuJu.' His father, however, insisted that his son was not autistic, saying he was a normal kid who loved video games and baseball, he said. 'He was a very bright, well-adjusted child, at least he was when he left here,' said Smith Sr., a 62-year-old retired truck driver. 'He pushed buttons and would aggravate you. But, other than that, it was just the typical way... of a typical boy trying to get his way.' Tragic: The psychic said that she knew she was close when she smelled 'something dead' In danger: Terry, who weighs 76 pounds and is 4'8"", most likely did not take his medicine with him which will cause problems because he is a high-functioning autistic . Smith Sr. also helped raise the half brother accused in the case, even though he was not his biological father, he said. The teen, whose name has been publicly released, moved from West Virginia to California after his mother abruptly pulled him out of school, he said. 'I taught him how to walk. I helped him when he was on the baseball team here,' he said, recalling that he called the half brother 'little Spider-Man.' Investigators told Smith Sr. that Terry Jr. died after a hit to the head but declined to say more, saying he didn't want to jeopardize the investigation. 'I think him and (the half brother) got into it and it went too far,' said Smith Sr. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .","Terry Dewayne Smith Jr.'s mother realized her son was missing Sunday morning after his teenage half-brother babysat the night before .

The raid was caught on CCTV as three intruders, armed with a machete, a sledgehammer, and a baseball bat, targeted the premises in the middle of the day. In the footage the trio can be seen forcing their way into family-run The Gold Shop on in Dudley Hill, Bradford, West Yorkshire, as the owner, two members of staff and a customer flee to a panic room. Scroll down for video . Armed: The three armed men can be seen running towards The Gold Shop in Bradford, West Yorkshire, with weapons in their hands . Violent: One of the robbers uses his sledgehammer to smash his way into the jeweller's shop - the other two were armed with a machete and a baseball bat . Prepared: The armed men, who covered their faces and wore hoods, raise their weapons as they storm into The Gold Shop on Wakefield Road, Dudley Hill, Bradford, West Yorkshire . The raiders, who are all disguised, are captured leaping over the counters, using their weapons to smash glass cabinets and stuffing jewellery into a bag, before they realise the shutters have come down. They then frantically batter the metal doors to make their escape. Appearing at Bradford Crown Court yesterday, one of the gang, Liam Benson, 30, was sentenced by Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC to eight years imprisonment. As the CCTV images show, the three men targeted the jewellery shop at 11.40am on May 23 this year. A Golf car, which had been stolen and featured false plates, pulled up outside the shop, and the men wearing tracksuits and with their heads covered, got out. Caught on camera: The trio can clearly be seen forcing their way into family-run The Gold Shop on Wakefield Road, Dudley Hill, Bradford, West Yorkshire . Wrecking the place: The robbers smashed several glass display cases to grab the jewellery inside . Quick-thinking: The owner, two members of staff and a customer fled to a secure room ahead of the gang gaining access to the store . The gang smashed their way through the doors to gain entry, but the owner, Maurice Willan, managed to activate the SmartWater system and the roller shutters, sealing the robbers inside. The raiders, who were inside the premises for just two and a half minutes, escaped with jewellery and watches worth more than £100,000, which has not been recovered. Benson, of Third Avenue, Rothwell, Leeds, pleaded guilty to robbery at an earlier hearing at Bradford Crown Court. Mr Willan welcomed the sentence and revealed he has since spent £15,000 on extra security, including steel doors and bullet-proof glass. He said: 'It was horrible watching these people smashing up my property. I felt helpless. Trapped: But when they attempted to leave the way they'd come, the robbers discovered the owner had activated an alarm system and rollershutters . Smashing their way out: One of the gang members uses his sledgehammer to smash his way out of the shop . Trying to escape: The robber with the sledgehammer can seen bending to his knees to try and lift up the shutter . 'We could hear all the banging and smashing, and we couldn’t do anything. 'It makes me even more determined to do what I am doing. You can’t let these people win.' Detective Constable Dean Smith said: 'Liam Benson did not think twice about using a weapon to steal high-value items. 'This was a well-planned offence, and it has caused considerable distress to the victim and the witnesses involved. 'The custodial sentence given to Benson sends a very strong message that such crimes will be investigated thoroughly, and those who commit them will be identified and will be prosecuted.' Three other men have been bailed pending forensic inquiries in connection with the incident.

U.S. consumers have fallen out of love with tech giants Apple and Google, according to recent market research by YouGov BrandIndex. The two companies have fallen off the top ten list of best-perceived brands in 2013. Google was listed at number 10 in the second half of 2012, while Apple had already dropped. However, it doesn't seem to be technology the public has lost interest in: Amazon made two appearances in the list with its Kindle e-reader brand at number nine and Amazon, which took out the top spot for online retailing, came in at number two out of all brands. Out of favor: Google has endured a bit of an image problem of late and is no longer ranked in the top 10 companies for consumer perception . So why have these two tech stalwarts now fallen out of favor? Public perceptions of Google changed when its young, liberal, innovative image took a knock after the NSA revelations by Edward Snowden. Google had been rated the fourth best-perceived brand in 2011, but after a lukewarm reception to Google+ it fell in esteem the following year. Security: Consumers lost trust in Google following data-mining allegations . Popularity contest: Amazon is well-perceived with consumers, featuring twice on the list thanks to its Kindle brand, but Apple has fallen off the list and recently been convicted of conspiring to fix e-book prices . Earlier this year, privacy issues and the negative coverage surrounding PRISM have seen it fall further still and left the company scrambling to retain consumer trust. Meanwhile, Apple lost its charismatic front man Steve Jobs and then faced a chorus of disapproval over allegations of child labor in its supply chain, not to mention long-reported harsh conditions in its Chinese factories. Most recently, the brand was convicted on . Wednesday of conspiring to raise and fix the price of e-books in an . attempt to dominate the market leader, Amazon. Leader: After the death of Apple CEO Steve Jobs, the brand has suffered some setbacks . Appalling conditions: A spate of suicides of Chinese workers at factories producing Apple products has created negative publicity for Apple . The company at the top of consumer perception is Ford, after a profitable year and successful promotional campaigns. Coming in at number 10 is Cheerios, which gained positive media attention for its 'Just Checking' advertisement featuring a mixed-race family. A few bigots created a social-media stink about the ad, which only served to make the brand more popular when General Mills stood by the campaign, saying the actors cast in the spot reflected the changing U.S. population. The brand has also hit the mark with its healthy-eating messages. YouTube also secured consumer approval with its strong LGBT acceptance stance and its growing role as a vehicle for major news stories such as the Paula Deen video apology, which was viewed by almost four million people. YouGov BrandIndex measures consumer perceptions by surveying 5,000 people daily on whether they’ve heard anything good or bad about a brand in the past two weeks.

The Navy has successfully landed a drone the size of a fighter jet aboard an aircraft carrier for the first time Wednesday, showing the military's capability to have a computer program perform one of the most difficult tasks a pilot is asked to do. The landing of the X-47B experimental aircraft means the Navy can move forward with its plans to develop another unmanned aircraft that will join the fleet alongside traditional airplanes to provide around-the-clock surveillance while also possessing a strike capability. It also would pave the way for the U.S. to launch unmanned aircraft without the need to obtain permission from other countries to use their bases. Scroll down for video . Takeoff: A X47-B Navy drone launched off the deck of the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier on Wednesday . The X-47B experimental aircraft took off from Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland before approaching the USS George H.W. Bush, which is operating off the coast of Virginia. The drone landed by deploying a tailhook that caught a wire aboard the ship and brought it to a quick stop, just like normal fighter jets do. Taking flight: The X-47B will never be put into operational use, but it will help Navy officials develop future carrier-based drones . The maneuver is known as an arrested landing and has previously only been done by the drone on land at Patuxent River. Landing on a ship that is constantly moving while navigating through turbulent air behind the aircraft carrier is seen as a more difficult maneuver. ‘Your grandchildren and great grandchildren and mine will be reading about this historic event in their history books. This is not trivial, nor is it something that came lightly,’ said Rear Adm. Mat Winter, the Navy's program executive officer for unmanned aviation and strike weapons. The X-47B will never be put into operational use, but it will help Navy officials develop future carrier-based drones. Those drones could begin operating by 2020, according to Winter. Four companies are expected to compete for a contract to design the future unmanned aircraft, which will be awarded in Fiscal Year 2014. The two experimental aircrafts that have been built for the first round of testing will be retired and placed in museums at Patuxent River and at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. The move to expand the capabilities of the nation's drones comes amid growing criticism of America's use of Predators and Reapers to gather intelligence and carry out lethal missile attacks against terrorists in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen. Critics in the U.S. and abroad have charged that drone strikes cause widespread civilian deaths and are conducted with inadequate oversight. Still, defense analysts say drones are the future of warfare. The maneuver is known as an arrested landing and has previously only been done by the drone on land at Patuxent River . The move to expand the capabilities of the nation's drones comes amid growing criticism of America's use of Predators and Reapers to gather intelligence and carry out lethal missile attacks against terrorists in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen . The X-47B is far bigger than the Predator, has three times the range and can be programmed to carry out missions with no human intervention, the Navy said. While the X-47B isn't a stealth aircraft, it was designed with the low profile of one. That will help in the development of future stealth drones, which would be valuable as the military changes its focus from the Middle East to the Pacific, where a number of countries' air defenses are a lot stronger than Afghanistan's. The X-47B has a wingspan of about 62 feet and weighs 14,000 pounds, versus nearly 49 feet and about 1,100 pounds for the Predator. While Predators are typically piloted via remote control by someone in the U.S., the X-47B relies only on computer programs to tell it where to fly unless a human operator needs to step in. The Navy says the aircraft relies on precision GPS navigation, a high-integrity network connection and advanced flight control software to guide itself. Developed by Northrop Grumman under a 2007 contract at a cost of $1.4 billion, the X-47B is capable of carrying weapons and is designed to be the forerunner for a drone program that will provide around-the-clock intelligence, surveillance and targeting, according to the Navy, which has been giving updates on the project over the past few years. The X-47B has a wingspan of about 62 feet and weighs 14,000 pounds, versus nearly 49 feet and about 1,100 pounds for the Predator . ‘It has taken several years of software development, thousands of simulated landings in high fidelity labs and many hours of flight test in the Patuxent River landing pattern to prove this aircraft is up for the challenge,’ Captain Jaime Engdahl, program manager for the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System wrote in a blog post. ‘Today X-47B is ready!’ The X-47B can reach an altitude of more than 40,000 feet and has a range of more than 2,100 nautical miles, versus 675 for the Predator. The Navy plans to show the drone can be refueled in flight, which would give it even greater range.","Navy hails the landing as a massive achievement because now they will be able to develop more unmanned drones .

A high-flying businesswoman may sue cosmetics firm Clarins after red sores broke out all over her face when she used its expensive beauty products. Karen Mooney, 52, discovered she had an allergy to methylisothiazolinone (MI), a preservative in the Clarins creams. She is among the latest victims of what dermatologists say is an epidemic of allergies caused by the compound. Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed experts are calling for an immediate ban on MI.Doctors at St Thomas’ Hospital in London blame the compound for a massive surge in patients with skin problems. Karen’s skin began breaking out in welts after regularly using Clarins products, such as the Lait Demaquillant Cleansing Milk and Extra-Firming Day Cream. The dating agency boss from Surrey had been using Clarins products for cleansing and moisturising for two decades. She said: ‘I’ve always had really healthy skin so I was terrified by the sores and made an appointment to see my GP. I assumed it was stress. My doctor agreed.’ The doctor prescribed hydrocortisone cream but it made no difference. Two months later the welts were so painful she couldn’t cover them with make-up. Finally Karen saw Dr Olivia O’Gorman-Lalor, a consultant  dermatologist at Ashford and St Peters Hospital in Surrey. Tests found Karen had a severe allergic reaction to MI and to Clarins’ Lait Demaquillant. 'Terrifying': Karen was covered in red sores after using the luxury skincare . Karen’s allergic reaction came as no surprise to Dr O’Gorman-Lalor. She said: ‘I’ve seen more and more cases like these in the past two years. The general feeling is that it’s due to MI being used more widely and at higher concentrations.’ Karen now avoids MI and her condition is under control, but she struggles to find MI-free products. She says: ‘I have to be incredibly careful. Expensive: Karen says this Clarins Lait Demaquillant product caused her welts . ‘It’s hard because the same preservative is called by many different names. It’s in so many things it’s difficult to avoid – I’ve only found two shampoos without it and can’t find a suntan lotion so have to stay out of the sun.’ The preservative was first approved for use in skincare in 2005. Two studies presented at the British Association of Dermatologists’ conference last week showed a sharp rise in reactions to MI over the past three years. Consultant dermatologist Dr John McFadden said: ‘This is one of the worst outbreaks I have ever seen. There hasn’t been anything on this scale before. We just don’t know when it will peak.’ Manufacturers have ignored calls for immediate action, but legal experts warn they could become liable for compensation claims. The Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association – the trade association representing UK manufacturers – this week met dermatologists to ‘plan further meetings to discuss the most appropriate step to undertake’. But Clarins dismissed concerns, claiming that cases of MI allergy are isolated. A spokesman said: ‘It is inevitable that someone, somewhere will be unable to tolerate a particular ingredient or combination of ingredients within a product formula.’ The company insists its ingredients are approved by the European Commission and its safety is reviewed by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety. Clarins would not, however, confirm whether it had recently changed its formulations to include MI.","Dating agency boss broke out in painful sores after using Clarins products .

Hakim Ghyas' open air clinic outside the city's largest mosque offers treatments for hundreds of patients each day. Despite rapid improvements in healthcare in India, bloodletting has remained popular with many people who have chosen to shun modern medicine in favour of the archaic therapy. Scroll down for video . Increasing numbers of Indian people are shunning moden healthcare in favour of the traditional treatment of blood letting. Patients at Hakim Ghyas' open air blood letting clinic in New Delhi exercise their legs as a part of the 'treatment' Mr Ghyas, 79, claims the technique can cure most forms of arthritis, heart disease and even the early stages of blood cancer. In a previous interview with CNN he also said that he did not charge patients for the treatment because most are ill and poor. Instead, to make money, Mr Ghyas depends on one son who is a shopkeeper while another son is following in the footsteps of his father and helps with the bloodletting.

It involves instigating controlled bleeding in an attempt to . rid the body of what practitioners refer to as 'polluted blood'. The technique was modeled on the process of menstruation.

At the Delhi clinic, patients must first stand in the sun for half an hour to make the blood flow more easily. Then the patient, still standing upright, is tied from the waist down with a rope, and the actual incisions are made with a razor blade. Research has been carried out to see if there are in fact any benefits to the treatment.

Theresa May pledged yesterday to boycott Brussels plans for an EU prosecutor and ‘European police force’. The Home Secretary said the UK will not participate in a proposal to create a prosecutor with jurisdiction to pursue cases across the European Union. And she said Britain would oppose any move to expand the Europol system of co-operation into a Europe-wide police force. Her intervention comes as ministers brace themselves for a Tory rebellion tonight over plans to keep Britain in the controversial EU arrest warrant system. Mrs May announced last week that Britain will opt out of 133 EU justice and home affairs powers before opting back in to 35, including the arrest warrant. Many Tories are unhappy at the move, although tonight’s rebellion over the opt-out is likely to be muted after Mrs May agreed to give MPs more time before a final decision on opting back in. On Wednesday the European Commission will announce plans for a prosecutor’s office whose powers will, initially, be limited to ‘investigation, prosecution and bringing to justice of offences affecting the EU budget’. Many Tories see the move as the thin end of the wedge. But in an interview yesterday, Mrs May insisted: ‘We are completely and utterly opposed to the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor or anything that heads in that direction. 'We will make sure Britain does not participate and will not come under the jurisdiction of any such prosecutor.' May say no Force be with us: The UK will boycott the proposal to expand the Europol system of co-operation into a Europe-wide police force, the Home Secretary promised . ‘Likewise, we will not have anything to do with any proposals to turn Europol into something akin to a European police force,' she added. Tory grandee Kenneth Clarke will today join Lord Mandelson and Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander at the launch of a pro-EU manifesto by the group British Influence. They will insist that leaving the EU would be a ‘historical error’ and argue that David Cameron is wrong to try to repatriate powers from Brussels.

A man was exposed as a bigamist after his first wife tracked him down on Facebook - only to discover wedding pictures of him and his new spouse. Brian Frain, 36, of Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, is now facing a possible prison sentence following Anne-Marie Sim's shock find. Frain married Ms Sim at Tameside Register Office in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, in June 1999 after a two-month ‘whirlwind romance’, a court was told. Brian Frain is facing prison after he was exposed as a bigamist. His first wife, seeking a divorce, tracked him down on Facebook and discovered pictures of his second wedding to Louise Meredith . They separated after two months and she moved to Scotland. Tameside Magistrates’ Court was told that she attempted to get in touch with Frain five years later to seek a divorce as she wanted to re-marry. She contacted solicitors and hired a firm to track him down, but they couldn’t locate him. Eventually, Mrs Frain turned detective herself and hunted him down through Facebook - where she saw the wedding pictures of his marriage in September 2009 to Louise Meredith, the court heard. He used the same register office for both weddings. Frain claimed he thought the marriage was over because it had only lasted two months and took place 10 years ago. David Curtis, prosecuting, said: 'She made enquiries with the register office and he had not told them that he was already married.' Mr Curtis said that in interviews, Frain admitted that he had married in 1999. He said: 'Due to the amount of time that had passed, Mr Frain assumed that he was no longer married to her. 'He did not inform the register office and took no legal advice.' The court was told Frain met his second wife Louise, from Droylsden, in June 2007. They formed a friendship after they exchanged messages over the internet, district judge Paul Richardson heard. Mr Curtis added: 'He made no mention that he was married. Police were contacted and Frain was later arrested.' Frain pleaded guilty to a single count of bigamy. The case was adjourned for sentence. In a statement written by Ms Meredith, read out to the court, she said: 'Although I had been married before, I was under the impression that this was Brian’s first marriage. 'The wedding went well. I truly believed that I was his first wife. This has obviously affected me.' The court was told that they are no longer together. Rachel Wilson, defending, said Frain claims his second wife knew that he was married. District judge Richardson ruled that a short trial would be held on August 7 to settle the point. Ms Wilson said: 'He fully complied with the police. Ten years later he meets the second wife. He believes that at that stage, his marriage no longer existed because of the fact that it was only for two months and it was 10 years ago. 'He accepts that he was ignorant.' District judge Richardson told Frain: . 'It makes a difference whether or not you deceived this lady. Your . statements are opposite and we are going to have a trial of the issue.' Out of the blue: Louise Meredith said she was in 'shock' when police told her about the bigamy investigation . Frain was bailed to appear again in court on August 7. After the case, Louise, 34, said: 'I got a phone call around February this year from the police asking about Brian. I said I am not with him.

Disgraced: Stuart Hall, 83, is facing five new allegations of abuse - including the rape of a girl . Disgraced BBC presenter Stuart Hall is facing five new allegations of abuse - including the rape of a 12-year-old girl, it emerged last night. The alleged rape is said to have taken place two decades ago after the shamed star met the girl through some relatives. Police are investigating the allegation along with four other claims concerning sexual assaults. In May, Hall, 83, admitted sexually abusing 13 girls, including one as young as nine, between 1967 and 1985. He was jailed last month at Preston Crown Court but to the fury of victims and justice campaigners, he was sentenced to just 15 months’ imprisonment, of which he will serve half – meaning barely two weeks inside for each victim. The new allegations - involving a rape - could spark a fresh wave of protests concerning his sentence. A source told the Daily Mirror: ‘The (alleged) victim was the daughter of friends well known to some of his relatives. She’s now in her 30s.’ A Lancashire Police spokesman said: ‘We can confirm we have received further allegations against Mr Hall and we are working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to determine the most appropriate course of action. ‘We take all allegations of sexual abuse seriously and we would encourage people with any information about sexual abuse or who has been a victim of sexual abuse to come forward and report their concerns confident in the knowledge it will be investigated with sensitivity.’ After sentencing Hall, the Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell QC, said he had to sentence Hall, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, according to the guidelines in place at the time of the offences. Behind bars: Hall (left) was jailed last month at Preston Crown Court but to the fury of victims and justice campaigners, he was sentenced to just 15 months' imprisonment, of which he will serve half . But even then the maximum sentence for the most serious offences he committed was five years. Today it would be ten years. The Government’s most senior law officer, Attorney General Dominic Grieve, was deluged with more than 150 complaints about the sentence. Mr Grieve, who has the power to send cases to the Court of Appeal if he considers the sentence ‘unduly lenient’, announced last week that the Hall case would be referred. The case will in due course be heard by three Court of Appeal judges who will decide whether or not the sentence is unduly lenient and whether they should increase the sentence.’ The case is expected to be heard in around six weeks’ time. When the claims against Hall, 83, first emerged he flatly denied them and protested his innocence. Senior law officer: Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who has the power to send cases to the Court of Appeal if he considers the sentence 'unduly lenient', announced last week that the Hall case would be referred . After he was first arrested last December, he told police his victims were all lying as part of a ‘vendetta going on against people in the public eye’. But the publicity generated by his arrest led to more victims coming forward with overwhelming evidence of his guilt. The court heard his crimes spanned nearly 20 years, between 1967 and 1986, with assaults taking place on BBC premises and at his home. He even abused family friends. Earlier this month the Mail revealed the former It’s a Knockout presenter was trying to pay off his victims with ‘paltry’ out-of-court settlements. The multi-millionaire signed over the deeds of his £2million house to his wife just before he was jailed, and is now offering those he abused as little as £2,000 to prevent them claiming compensation. At least 17 women are suing him over the harm they suffered at his hands. Susan Harrison, who was 16 when Hall lured her to BBC premises on the false pretext of helping her record a song, before attacking her in his car, has been offered just £5,000 in an out-of-court settlement.

Children are being denied full-time places at primary school after Michael Gove appeared to relax the rules. Four-year-olds had been given an automatic right to a whole day of classes. But the Education Secretary removed a reference to providing them with 'full-time' education in last year's school admissions code. The U-turn will cause chaos for thousands of working parents left paying for childcare or looking for shift work if schools insist on educating their children part-time. A Department for Education source yesterday claimed policy had not changed but admitted the phrase had been axed from the foreword of the document schools refer to. One parent is already preparing a legal challenge after a school said it would only teach her child for a few hours each day. Dr Andrea Jarman registered her daughter Eibhlis at St Mark's Primary School in Talbot, Bournemouth, but was told she only qualified for three hours every day, either in the morning or afternoon, during the first term. The lecturer in law at Bournemouth University was advised to find another school when she complained she could not fit her work around the timetable. 'Does Michael Gove not want more women in work, rather than having to give up their job or go part-time because they cannot get a full-time place for their child?' she said. Jane Portman, Bournemouth Council's executive director for adults and children's services, told The Observer: 'The council supports parents' right to choose to place their child in full-time education at the start of the reception year. 'Unfortunately, Department for Education regulations are not clear about the requirements on schools to make such an offer. The council is therefore seeking further clarification on how the regulation should be applied. ' Labour introduced the guarantee for full-time education for four-year-olds in 2009 under the then Education Secretary Ed Balls. Details of the way schools are . interpreting the admissions code emerged as Department for Education . figures showed record numbers of young children are being taught in . classes of 31 or more. Nearly 72,000 five to seven-year-olds are now in large classes, up from 31,265 in 2010.Over the past year alone numbers have soared from 47,290 to 71,935. Four-year-olds had been given an automatic right to a whole day of classes. But the Education Secretary removed a reference to providing them with 'full-time' education in last year's school admissions code . Mr Gove axed a rule that stated classes could only have more than 30 pupils for a maximum of one year. Schools are struggling to cope with a sustained baby boom and around 120,000 children are expected to be without a primary school place in September according to an analysis by Labour. The National Audit Office has warned that number will double to 240,000 by next year. Education experts say capital funding for schools has been cut while a third of free schools, which are state funded but independently run, are being allowed to open in areas with a surplus of places.Local authorities have been looking into the possibility of renting space in closed stores, warehouses and police stations to be used as temporary classrooms. Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg accused Mr Gove of 'presiding over an education crisis'.'There is a huge shortfall in school places and now class sizes are rising again,' he said. Mr Gove said: 'Labour cut 200,000 primary places, slashed the amount spent on areas of population growth and let immigration soar - and all this in the middle of a baby boom. 'The coalition government has, however, taken swift action to repair the damage. We have more than doubled funding for new school places.' A Department for Education spokeswoman said: 'Every child has the right to a full-time school place in the September following their fourth birthday.'","Education Secretary reference to providing children with 'full-time' education in last year's school admissions code .

Early starter: Robert Knowles (pictured in May), 66, of Plymouth, Devon, began his criminal career aged 13 . After his 185th court appearance and 332nd conviction, there are very few people who can rival the criminal record of Robert Knowles. Now the 66-year-old from Plymouth, Devon, is back behind bars again after being jailed for eight months for stealing from a Marks & Spencer store. Knowles, who lives in a hostel, began his criminal career aged just 13 and has astonishingly appeared in court every year since 1959. A judge told the alcoholic at Plymouth Crown Court that it was ‘the end of the road’, as he locked up Knowles for eight months. The thief was brought before the court for stealing from an M&S store on successive days. He has had 197 out of his 332 convictions for theft by shoplifting, prosecutor Alistair Verheijen said, adding that M&S staff allowed him to go free after he was caught with two bottles of whisky worth £70 on June 10. But he returned the next day and stole wine, chicken and boxer shorts worth £30. This time he was arrested by police. The court heard he had been in court twice this year for shoplifting - receiving a fine a week before his latest spree. His barrister Ali Rafati said he was an unwell man and needed a CT (computerised tomography) scan, adding: ‘He does not seem to be able to cope with life on the outside at the moment.’ He said Knowles is now ‘institutionalised’ and steals so that he can go back to prison on his release. Judge Paul Darlow said: ‘You have had 184 court appearances. We have reached the end of the road. I am sure you will be able to get the CT scan you need in prison.’ Sentencing: A judge told the alcoholic at Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) that it was 'the end of the road' Knowles was sent to a correctional school in 1959 and has been adding to his criminality ever since. The Crown Prosecution Service has been unable to provide a full breakdown of his lifetime of offending because many of the crimes pre-dated its creation in 1986. Last year Knowles was jailed for stealing whisky miniatures the day after finishing a spell in prison. Plymouth Crown Court heard he had £160 in his pocket at the time – and knew perfectly well he would be sent back to jail. 'You have had 184 court appearances. We have reached the end of the road' Judge Paul Darlow . Recorder Robin Belben told him at last October’s hearing: ‘You have been caught in a revolving door over the last two or three years. ‘You commit an offence, you go to prison – and you commit another as soon as you are released.’ Knowles is said to be ‘resigned to spending the rest of his life in prison’ because he is unable to cope with living outside jail. In June 2011 Knowles admitted the theft of two bottles of whisky, watches and socks worth £279 from Marks and Spencer.","Robert Knowles, 66, of Plymouth, began criminal career aged just 13 .

"By . Jason Groves and Ian Drury . PUBLISHED: . 19:19 EST, 14 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:19 EST, 14 July 2013 . Deterrent: A Trident missile launches from a nuclear-powered submarine . Liberal Democrat plans to downgrade Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent represent a ‘risk no responsible government would take’, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned last night. In a strongly-worded article for the Daily Mail, Mr Hammond accuses Nick Clegg of taking a ‘reckless’ gamble with national security by pushing for the trusted Trident system to be replaced by a cut-down deterrent. His intervention comes as leaked documents reveal an extraordinary Lib Dem plan to halve the number of Trident submarines  from four to two and send them to sea unarmed. Tomorrow Mr Hammond will publish a formal review of alternatives to the Trident system. The review was demanded by Mr Clegg, whose party is pushing for an end to the continuous at-sea deterrent that has kept Britain safe for 45 years. Mr Hammond makes it clear that both he and David Cameron have already rejected any alternative to a full replacement of the existing system. He says the Government remains ‘100 per cent committed to maintaining and renewing the Trident system’, which uses a fleet of submarines to keep Britain’s nuclear missiles permanently at unknown locations at sea. Tridents are carried on board four Vanguard-class nuclear-powered submarines operating out of Faslane on the Clyde. The ageing fleet will come to the end of its life in the mid-2020s. The Conservatives and Labour want to replace it with a new £20billion generation of state-of-the-art submarines, which would cost about £3billion a year to run. A decision will not be taken until 2016. The Lib Dems are pushing for the fleet to be cut to three, or even two, with the missiles left at vulnerable locations on land most of the time. They argue that it is time to move on from the Cold War. Mr Hammond says the move would make little difference to the cost of renewing the Trident system, but would pose an unacceptable risk at a time when there are more than 17,000 nuclear weapons in the world and a string of hostile states such as Iran trying to obtain them. Ageing: The Trident fleet will come to the end of its life in the mid-2020s but the Government is committed to replacing it . ‘History teaches us that the  defence of this country means being ready for the unexpected,’ Mr  Hammond says. Documents leaked to the Daily Mail reveal Lib Dem proposals to build only two new submarines to replace the current four. This would end the requirement for one to be always on patrol at sea. The proposal, which will be debated at the party’s annual conference in September, was finalised by a high-level Lib Dem working group involving Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander. Critics said having only two boats meant every other nation would know when the UK had an unarmed submarine at sea, undermining the deterrent effect. They also said having a ‘declaratory policy’ of deploying only unarmed missiles would be a ‘gift’ to other nations. A well-placed Whitehall source said: ‘Hostile leaders around the globe would sigh with relief that the UK was no longer a serious military nation.’","Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has criticised plan to downgrade .

A primary school teacher accused of sending ‘lewd’ sex messages to a teenage boy who then committed suicide has been cleared after a dramatic last-ditch intervention by Government lawyers. A judge was set to rule on the case of Iwan Harding, 34, after a trial heard he sent sexually explicit text messages to 16-year-old Anthony Stubbs about having sex in his school uniform. A court heard Harding asked Anthony, a prefect pupil and father-of-one from Leyland, Lancashire, about the size of his manhood and described him as a ‘horny lad’. Anthony Stubbs hanged himself after his girlfriend Charlotte Mason, pictured with baby Lily, found the messages . The court was told that the teacher also sent indecent images of himself to the teenager along with an explicit video of two men performing a sex act. Anthony’s girlfriend found messages on his phone and confronted the ‘confused’ teenager. He disappeared from home and was later found hanged. But yesterday the senior legal advisor to the Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer, ordered the CPS in Wales to drop the prosecution. District Judge Andrew Shaw was told by prosecutor Julie Hughes at Llanberis Magistrates Court: ‘This was a sensitive case which was reviewed carefully at the highest level and the area was satisfied both the evidential and public interest criteria had been met. ‘However, the principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions has taken a different view. She is of the view proceedings shouldn’t be proceeded with.’ Miss Hughes added: ‘From the area’s point of view we aren’t of the belief there was any error or omission in bringing the prosecution.’ No evidence was offered after the case was reopened. Iwan Harding has been cleared after a dramatic last-minute intervention by Government lawyers . Anthony’s mother, Denise Machin, 35, said she was ‘disgusted’ by the decision. She said: ‘This man is a school teacher and it scares me that he could potentially be free to carry on teaching children after what he has done. ‘He has abused his position of trust. This man is the same age as me and he knew Anthony was a schoolboy. ‘I’ve not had any contact from the CPS about this case and have had to read about this man’s explicit messages to my son in the press. It has been heartbreaking all over again for me, my family and Charlotte. I’ve received no victim support and we all just felt sick when we saw what this man was accused of. ‘I think the judge should have been left to come to a verdict. This is not just about Anthony, this is to protect other children as well. ‘Anthony was a young man who had only just turned 16 and was just trying to find his sexuality. This man has taken advantage of that and was pressuring him with sexually explicit videos and text messages.‘That pressure from this man and others contributed to his death, in my opinion. ‘I will do everything in my power to stop him abusing his position again.’ Following the trial, Judge Shaw had reserved his judgment to take more time to reflect because the case was an ‘important’ one which could have ‘substantial implications’ for future hearings. But yesterday, Judge Shaw told Harding: ‘There’s no prosecution for me to consider and I find you not guilty.’ The teacher of Llanberis, Gwynedd declined to comment as he left court. A spokesman for the CPS in London said: ‘We have reconsidered our position on the allegations against Iwan Harding and informed the court and defence that we no longer believe this prosecution should proceed. We offered no evidence against Mr Harding at the magistrates’ court.’ At the earlier hearing the prosecution alleged the messages were ‘obscene and indecent’. Miss Hughes said last month: ‘We are talking about a 33-year-old primary school teacher sending text messages of such a nature and photographs of his penis and video of another male to a person he knows is a schoolboy. He believes him to be 17 but he’s actually 16.’ ‘The messages themselves are obscene and indecent and, to an extent, that is conceded by the defendant in interview,’ she added. Harding denied sending grossly offensive or decent, obscene messages at Caernarfon Magistrates' Court . Tudur Owen, defending Harding, previously told the court that the case raised ‘issues of public concern’ because the Crown was alleging that the sending of salacious texts between two individuals amounted to a criminal act. Mr Owen said: ‘It’s a tragic case [but] there were no fixed plans for the men to meet. A lot of it is effectively fantasy.’ Harding, who has been suspended by his school, accepted he sent images and a video to Anthony who, he said, had claimed to be 17. But he denied sending grossly offensive or indecent, obscene messages between October 7 and 19 last year. Anthony discovered he was going to be a father when he was 15 and had just celebrated his 16th birthday when Lily was born last September. He went missing on November 24 last year following an argument with his partner and mother of his child Charlotte Mason, 18, after she discovered messages on his phone. Detective Sergeant Richard Horton, of Lancashire police, said that although Anthony’s body was not found until January 14, he had killed himself in woods near his Leyland home soon after he vanished.His mobile phone showed he had contacted 14 people through Love Leap, including a 47-year-old Manchester man. The teenager also spoke to 12 others via the internet video telephone service Skype. He and Harding had met on the dating site Love Leap. The teenager had registered as ‘young sexy gay’. The pair had been in contact previously on Facebook and Anthony sent messages through the course of the ‘virtual relationship’, the court heard. Miss Hughes said the subsequent text messages were of an ‘extremely explicit sexual nature’. Messages went both ways. But the prosecutor said: ‘In comparison to the ones sent to Mr Stubbs there’s a marked difference in the content.’ Harding’s solicitor said his future employment would be a matter for the General Teaching Council for Wales.","Anthony Stubbs, 16, vanished after girlfriend Charlotte Mason found texts .

Anyone tuning in to the start of one of South Korea's most popular TV shows may believe they will get an evening of light entertainment with a group of women gossiping, having a laugh and flirting with their male guests. Yes, it sounds like an episode of the UK's Loose Women or Oprah in the U.S. But as Daisy Donovan discovered, 'Now On My Way To Meet You’ can cut from the trivia to traumatic in seconds. The women on the panel are North Korean 'defector beauties'. They have escaped the brutal dictatorship in the North and now star on the show - that airs on South Korean prime time TV -  to share their stories. Scroll down for video . Fun: The South Korean show Now On My Way To Meet You kicks off with dancing and chit chat . Tears: But things can quickly turn solemn when they remember their lives in North Korea . With tensions between North and South . Korea higher than they’ve been in decades, Daisy goes behind the scenes . on the programme for the Channel 4 series The Greatest Shows on Earth, that airs at 10pm this evening. She found that 'alongside the chat and fluff, the women also reveal shocking details of their lives in the isolated dictatorship, including torture, starvation and brainwashing - and every show ends with a defector telling their heartrending story, often looking for lost family members.' One of the  'defector beauties' reveals how she was once tortured. Loose Women with a twist: The women flirt with their male guests but also tackle serious issues . She said: 'When I was young I saw all the public executions. And if you escape, I was sent back to North Korea and the torture was just unbearable. It’s better to die than go through that again.' Another described how as a child she was forced to take part in the 'mass games'. School children must practise for months on end to create a visual spectator where they move in unison, creating giant images by each holding up a certain colour card. 'I was sent back to North Korea and the torture was just unbearable. It's better to die than go through that again' The children are slapped if they get a move wrong in training and are barely given time to eat or drink. Some even have to wet themselves because they are not given toilet breaks. When Daisy asked the 'defector beauties' how the North views the West, they revealed how children there are taught to hate Americans from an early age. At school every year they have a 'Destroy the American scum day' - a sports day where events include races where children must be the fastest to a model of an American which they must beat with a stick. Behind the scenes: Daisy Donovan was intrigued by the show that airs on prime time South Korean television . Freedom: The 'defector beauties' have all escaped from hardship in the North . One of the women explained: 'In the North they believe America is the main reason why the North and South divided when war broke out. They believe if they just get the Americans out, Korea will automatically reunite as one.' But Daisy's travels in the South revealed that the countries couldn't be more different. While everything people in the North do is tightly controlled - including what they watch - in the South people have a vast array of entertainment choices with more than four million online TV channels available to them. Daisy said: 'Seoul is the most wired city in the world, with the fastest internet connection on the planet and wifi on the underground. With high speed streaming available even underground, South Koreans can enjoy their favourite action fuelled dramas and spectacular pop concerts live and in HD whilst they’re on the move. But in the UK, the infrastructure needed for this kind of technology is years away.

Paul Gascoigne threatened to jump off a pier after being thrown out of a casino in the middle of the night. The troubled ex-England star told relatives he was going to throw himself into the sea during a tearful phone call in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Friends and staff from the clinic where Gascoigne is being treated for alcoholism found him wandering near Bournemouth's Boscombe Pier at 4am after his family in Newcastle raised the alarm. Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne called his family to tell them he was going to throw himself into the sea at Bournemouth . Gascoigne was found by friends and clinic staff wandering near Boscombe Pier at 4am on Wednesday . They took him back to his flat in the seaside town, reports the Sunday Mirror, but he has not been seen since. Gascoigne, 46, is said to be in the worst physical and mental condition of his life, according to friends. The former footballer was allegedly asked to leave the casino after becoming abusive. A friend told the newspaper: 'We want him to ­realise he has one more chance to save himself but it really doesn’t look good. 'Paul called his family in Newcastle and then he called one of his sisters. He was rambling but he mentioned jumping off the pier. 'His family were frantic. They knew they needed to get someone to him quick.' Friends told the newspaper that Gascoigne has accepted he will end up like George Best, the Manchester United legend who died in 2005 after years of alcoholism. Earlier this week Gascoigne was taken to hospital after being collapsing outside a London hotel. He was 'very drunk' and was using crutches to walk before he fell over, witnesses told police. Reports said he had two bottles of gin and hundreds of pounds in cash on him at the time he was taken ill. His collapse came only four days after he was arrested for allegedly attacking his ex-wife Sheryl and a train guard in a drunken assault in Stevenage. Gascoigne, pictured on ITV's Daybreak in March, is said by friends to be in his worst physical and mental condition yet . Gascoigne was arrested this week for an alleged assault on his ex-wife Sheryl, pictured together in 1993 . He was held in custody for a night before being released on bail the next morning but was later seen swigging gin from the bottle outside a corner shop in Camden, north London. Five months ago, Gascoigne went to rehab in the United States after being seen drunk and rambling at a public event. The £100,000 cost of his treatment was funded by celebrity friends including his England colleague Gary Lineker, DJ Chris Evans and Piers Morgan and he was seen with his family in May looking happy and healthy at Windsor Racecourse. Writing in his column for the Mail on Sunday's Event magazine today, Morgan said: 'We all feel terrible. Not because we wasted our money. We didn’t. We bought him at least a few more months of life. Gascoigne, pictured playing for England in 1994, has not been since seen Wednesday . 'No, we feel terrible because Paul is quite obviously so ill that he just can’t stop himself feeding his addiction. 'And it’s highly likely that if he continues the way he’s going, he will die very soon. 'He’s now a desperately lonely, seriously sick man who needs our love, support and help. After his return from rehab in March, Gascoigne told ITV's Daybreak that he wanted to 'get back to reality' and pledged to stay sober, although he admitted that his alcohol troubles were likely to continue.","Former England footballer made tearful phone call to family on Wednesday .

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 18:23 EST, 14 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:38 EST, 15 July 2013 . Sweet ban: Public health minister Anna Soubry calls for supermarkets to stop the 'guilt lanes' Supermarkets and newsagents are to be told to abolish so-called ‘guilt lanes’ which see shoppers tempted with fattening sweets and treats at checkouts. Public health minister Anna Soubry told the Daily Mail cynical store layouts were particularly difficult for parents with young children, adding: ‘Retailers should make it easier for us to make the right choices, not harder.’ The Department of Health is drawing up plans for a new industry code of practice on the marketing of products high in fat, sugar and salt. It will call on stores to commit to changing layouts to end ‘guilt lanes’, ending cheap multi-buy deals on fattening products, and a commitment to spend a fixed proportion of their marketing budgets on promoting healthier options. The new code may also restrict the use of cartoon characters, aimed at youngsters, on unhealthy products. The Government has also negotiated plans for a ‘traffic light’ labelling system on the front of packaging that will indicate the levels of fat, sugar and salt. Ministers say they want to focus on voluntary ‘responsibility deals’ with retailers rather than imposing ‘nanny state’ measures in law. Miss Soubry, who is tipped for promotion in a forthcoming Government reshuffle, said she was particularly concerned about shelves near tills being stacked with purchases such as sweets and chocolate. ‘Supermarket checkouts and newsagents can be really tough for parents with their young children. While we all need to take responsibility for our own health and that of our children, things are not helped when tempting treats are put on show when you stand in line waiting to pay,’ she said. Temptation: Rows of sweets are placed near the checkouts at a Marks & Spencer store in London . Miss Soubry added: ‘We all know why they are there and we all know that they can work. If you haven’t been nagged by your own children while you wait then I’m sure you have seen it happen to someone else. ‘Through the responsibility deal we are making  progress in reducing calories and cutting unhealthy ingredients from our foods. “It is worrying however, that some supermarkets and shops continue to influence people – especially young children - to pick up sweets and chocolate whilst waiting at the checkout. ‘We all need to take responsibility for our own health and the health of our children. But food manufacturers and retailers also bear a responsibility and I hope they will play their part by taking tough action to help us all live longer healthier lives.’ Since it launched the responsibility deal approach in 2011, ministers have struck agreements with stores that mean 70 per cent of fast food and takeaway meals sold now have calories clearly labelled. All of the major supermarkets have committed to removing artificial ‘trans fats’ from their products, and  over 70 per cent of the retail market and over half of the major high street and contract caterers are committed to further reductions in salt in over 80 categories of foods - such as bread, soups, cereals and pasta sauces. More than 30 major alcohol companies have committed to removing a billion units from sale. The initiative, which includes brands such as Echo Falls, First Cape and Heineken will see a greater choice of lower strength alcohol products and smaller measures by 2015. A source added: ‘Although this is great progress we know there is still much more that can be done. ‘In the fight against obesity one action we are considering to ensure that people are not led astray by unhealthy products is creating guilt free checkouts – removing all unhealthy food from the last purchasing opportunity. ‘It has been proven that whilst waiting in a queue, people are more likely to pick up impulse purchases. Removing sweets, chocolate and fizzy drinks will encourage everyone – especially children – to pick up healthier alternatives. ‘We have shown the voluntary approach can work with reductions in fat, calories and salt in foods, and through new consistent front of pack food labelling – which all the major supermarkets and some of the big manufacturers signed up to.’ In England, 16.3 per cent of children aged two to 15 are obese and 13.7 per cent of children aged two to 15 are overweight – making them far more likely to develop health conditions like type two diabetes and heart disease. Among the worst offenders visited by the Mail were: . M & S: Shoppers forced to queue in a snaking aisle fenced in by racks of snacks. On child-height shelves were rows of Percy Pig and Colin Caterpillar sweets. W H SMITH: Garish signs advertising three Wispa bars for £1 and two-for-£2 Coca Cola bottles. Checkout assistants often presented customers with further offers. POUNDLAND: Five-foot walls of boxes of sweets and chocolates led to the checkout. PRIMARK: Sweets such as Haribo, Chewits, Mentos and Polos on offer at £1 for five packets sat beside socks and underwear at the queues for the tills. SAINSBURY’S: Most large branches had few sweets on display at main tills, but self-checkout customers were funnelled through temptation to reach the units. At convenience-style ‘Local’ stores, customers were met with rows of mints and chocolate bars before they could get to the checkouts. BOOTS: Sweets and snacks such as crisps had a  prominent place on the way to the tills.","Call on stores to stop funnelling customers past unhealthy products .

George Osborne has started wearing a hi-tech wristband which makes sure he gets a good night’s sleep. The Chancellor of the Exchequer revealed he uses the UP wristband to monitor his sleep patterns and track his fitness regime. The black plastic Jawbone wristband links up with a smartphone app to allow users to take a ‘holistic approach to a healthy lifestyle’. Grilling: George Osborne was seen wearing the black wristband while giving evidence to the Treasury select committee . Worries that senior ministers are struggling to sleep at night seem to be spreading in government. It has emerged that Education Secretary Michael Gove has also taken to wearing a Jawbone wristband. Mr Osborne’s black version was first spotted as he gave evidence to the Treasury select committee this morning. It . was visible under the cuff of his right sleeve as he was grilled on his . plans for tax and spending. He has also been seen wearing it while out . running. Later he told . journalists that the gadget, which costs around £100, was given to him . as a birthday present when he turned 42 in May. What it shows . The technology works by monitoring . whether the user is in deep or light sleep and only wakes them at the . best time so they start the day feeling refreshed. It . also monitors physical activity 24/7, providing a record of the . Chancellor’s morning jog around St James’ Park near the Treasury. It . also makes it ‘fun and easy’ to keep track of what users eat, although . it is not known if he used it to record eating a Byron burger in the . Treasury on the eve of his Spending Review speech last month. The up device links in to a smartphone app which provides an on-screen 'daily dashboard'. Gift: The Chancellor revealed the £100 Jawbone gadget was a gift for his 42nd birthday in May . Active: The gadget tracks the wearer's movements 24 hours a day, including when the Chancellor goes jogging in central London . Manufacturers Jawbone say that the system 'not only visualizes your information so you can understand the meaning behind the numbers, it also discovers hidden connections in the way you live to deliver powerful insights. Over time, insights lead to new behaviors and new behaviors become new, healthier habits'. The wristband tracks movements during sleep to record periods of light and deep slumber and waking moments during the night. Its precision motion detection system captures a complete record of daily activity - or inactivity. Users can create a database of their diet by scanning barcodes and taking photos of their meals. Nutrition: The app can also be used to track what the user eats, including the Byron burger the Chancellor was pictured eating on the eve of his Spending Review last month . Mr Osborne explained why he was using it as he addressed a press gallery lunch with journalists in Westminster. He said: ‘It was a birthday present.

First released in 2011, it was withdrawn because of technical problems. After being totally re-engineered, it was relaunched the following year. However some blogs and reviews have claimed that the new, remodelled wristband still has glitches, with some people saying theirs stopped working shortly after buying the product, others claiming it records false information and some complaining it disrupts their sleep. Costing around £100, the portable personal trainer tracks a person’s eating habits, sleep and exercise - syncing with an app on a user’s mobile phone to offer advice about how to be healthier. From the moment a person wakes - by vibrating at the 'best' possible moment according to sleep patterns - the machine monitors everything they do, prompting the wearer to get up and move if they have been sat still, and even to 'log' everything they eat. Jawbone describe the UP as 'attractive, durable, water-resistant and unobtrusive' and even suggests it can be worn with a cocktail dress as easily as with gym kit. Inside the wristband is a motion sensor which stores steps, calories burned, distance, and active versus inactive time. The motion sensor even tracks the user while they sleep - tracking their movement to gauge when they fall asleep, how long it takes, and how much deep sleep they’re getting. If that wasn't enough, the iPhone app prompts the user to take photographs of every meal, and tracks where, when and what they have eaten. A 'Feed' screen on the mobile phone then offers an up-to-date stream of information about how a person is progressing with respect to your health. It also links with online 'health challenges' to set you tasks to achieve during the week.","Chancellor says gadget tracks his sleep, exercise and food intake .

Trayvon Martin's heartbroken mother has poured her heart out onto Twitter in the sensational aftermath of George Zimmerman's not-guilty verdict. In an emotional message posted just an hour after the jurors reached their decision, Sybrina Fulton called this 'her darkest hour' and prayed to Jesus for help and guidance. 'Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have. At the end of the day, GOD is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I will love you forever Trayvon!!! In the name of Jesus!!!' Scroll down for video . Devastated: The parents of Trayvon Martin, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, in the courtroom for the George Zimmerman trial in Seminole circuit court, in Sanford, Florida, on Thursday - they did not attend the verdict on Saturday evening . Testimony: Tracy Martin, the father of Trayvon Martin, testifies on the stand in George Zimmerman's second degree murder trial in Seminole circuit court, in Sanford, Florida, Monday, July 8th, 2013 . Trayvon's father, Tracy, also posted his reaction to the social networking site approximately half-an-hour after the verdict was announced. 'Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered, I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY (sic).' Thanking everyone who supported the Martin family during the three week long trial, Martin also paid tribute to his 17-year-old son and re-iterated that he and Trayvon's mother, Sybrina knew that he would be proud of their legal fight. 'God blessed Me and Sybrina with Tray and even in his death I know my baby proud of the FIGHT we along with all of you put up for him GOD BLESS (sic)'. Both Tracy Martin and Trayvon's mother Sybrina Fulton chose not to be in the Seminole Circuit Court when the jurors announced their decision just before 10 p.m. George Crump the family's attorney said that they will still be pursuing a civil case against George Zimmerman. Emotional: In this expanded tweet from the account of Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin - she describes the aftermath of the verdict as her darkest hour . At a press conference after the verdict,  Crump thanked all the protesters . nationwide who 'put their hoodies up and to everybody who said, 'I am . Trayvon.' Bernie De la Rionda, the lead prosecutor, said, 'I am disappointed in the verdict but I respect it. We accept the jury's verdict.' He urged supporters to remain calm and peaceful, despite the verdict. Around the nation, pockets of protest broke out from New York to Los Angeles. Using strong language Crump said, 'You have a little black boy who was killed.' 'It's going to be reported in history books and 50 years from now, our children will talk about Trayvon Martin's case like we talk about Emmett Till.' Till was a 14-years old when he was tortured, mutilated and murdered in 1955, in Mississippi. The black youth was accused of flirting with a white woman and the case shocked the nation and was one of the lead factors in the birth of the civil rights movement. In spite of Crumps racially charged language, prosecutors have never argued that Zimmerman racially profiled the teen and instead said the teen was profiled as a criminal. Heart-Broken: Tracy Martin took to Twitter to thank his supporters and to explain his devastation at the not-guilty verdict . Neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman was cleared of all charges Saturday in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager whose killing unleashed furious debate across the U.S. over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice. Zimmerman, 29, blinked and barely smiled when the verdict was announced. He could have been convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter. But the jury of six women, all but one of them white, reached a verdict of not guilty after deliberating well into the night Saturday. The jurors considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying. Legal Team: (2-L to R) Attorneys Natalie Jackson, Benjamin Crump, and Daryl Parks representing the family of Trayvon Martin sit stoically as George Zimmerman's not guilty verdict is read in the Seminole circuit court in Florida . Elated: George Zimmerman's parents Robert Zimmerman Sr. (L) and Gladys Zimmerman celebrate following his not guilty verdict in the Seminole circuit court in Sanford, Florida, USA, 13th July 2013 . Defense attorneys said the case was classic self-defense, claiming Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man's head against the concrete sidewalk when Zimmerman fired his gun. Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him was a 'wannabe cop' vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighborhood committed primarily by young black men. Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands, prosecutors said. State Attorney Angela Corey said after the verdict that she believed second-degree murder was the appropriate charge because Zimmerman's mindset 'fit the bill of second-degree murder.' 'We charged what we believed we could prove,' Corey said. As the verdict drew near, police and city leaders in the Orlando suburb of Sanford and other parts of Florida said they were taking precautions against the possibility of mass protests or unrest in the event of an acquittal. George Zimmerman listens as the verdict is announced that the jury finds him not guilty, with his attorneys Mark O'Mara (L) and co-counsel, Don West (2nd L) and Lorna Truett (2nd R), on Saturday evening . 'There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,' Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said immediately after jurors began deliberating. 'We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.' The verdict came a year and a half after civil rights protesters angrily demanded Zimmerman be prosecuted. Zimmerman wasn't arrested for 44 days after the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting as police in Sanford insisted that Florida's Stand Your Ground law on self-defense prohibited them from bringing charges. Florida gives people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear death or bodily harm. Martin's parents, along with civil rights leaders such as the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, argued that Zimmerman — whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic — had racially profiled their son. And they accused investigators of dragging their feet because Martin was a black teenager. Tracy Martin is seen here with teenage Trayvon in this undated family photo. Trayvon's parents reacted with sadness and frustration at the acquittal of the man who killed their son . Before a special prosecutor assigned to the case ordered Zimmerman's arrest, thousands of protesters gathered in Sanford, Miami, New York and elsewhere, many wearing hoodies like the one Martin had on the night he died. They also carried Skittles and a can of iced tea, items Martin had in his pocket. President Barack Obama weighed in, saying that if he had a son, 'he'd look like Trayvon.' Despite the racially charged nature of the case, race was barely mentioned at the trial. Even after the verdict, prosecutors said race was not about race. 'This case has never been about race or the right to bear arms,' Corey said. 'We believe this case all along was about boundaries, and George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries.' One exception was the testimony of Rachel Jeantel, the Miami teen who was talking to Martin by phone moments before he was shot. She said he described being followed by a 'creepy-ass cracker' as he walked through the neighborhood. People watch a news ticker in Times Square deliver the news that George Zimmerman was found not guilty on Saturday, July 13, 2013 in New York . Jeantel gave some of the trial's most riveting testimony. She said she overheard Martin demand, 'What are you following me for?' and then yell, 'Get off! Get off!' before his cellphone went dead. The jurors had to sort out clashing testimony from 56 witnesses in all, including police, neighbors, friends and family members. For example, witnesses who got fleeting glimpses of the fight in the darkness gave differing accounts of who was on top. And Martin's parents and Zimmerman's parents both claimed that the person heard screaming for help in the background of a neighbor's 911 call was their son. Numerous other relatives and friends weighed in, too, as the recording was played over and over in court. Zimmerman had cuts and scrapes on his face and the back of his head, but prosecutors suggested the injuries were not serious. Tennetta Foster cries after hearing a verdict of not guilty in the trial of George Zimmerman at the Seminole County Courthouse, Saturday, July 13, 2013, in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman had been charged for the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin . To secure a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury that Zimmerman acted with a 'depraved' state of mind — that is, with ill will, hatred or spite. Prosecutors said he demonstrated that when he muttered, 'F------ punks. These a-------. They always get away' during a call to police as he watched Martin walk through his neighborhood. To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.","Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin took to Twitter to express their devastation at George Zimmerman's not-guilty verdict .

Becky, who lives in Birmingham, said: 'I was 11 stone when I saw the picture of me in a bikini and I was disgusted with myself. 'And I didn't have the confidence to wear one again until now but I'm in the best shape of my life and I'm proud to show my figure off.' New woman: Becky Latham, 32, shows off her new body in the Bikini Diva category of Miss Galaxy Universe after losing three stone . Before and after: She was originally a size 14 . but was so horrified by this bikini photos that she embarked on a grueling . fitness programme and worked out six times a week . Last month, 32-year-old Becky took to the stage in front of hundreds of people to compete in the Bikini Diva category of beauty and fitness competition Miss Galaxy Universe. She said: 'Putting on the bikini really did make me feel like a million dollars for the first time in my life and I loved every single second on stage. 'It was emotional and I think I cried when I had finished but I was so pleased I had done it. 'The blood, sweat and tears of the last 18 months had really paid off.' New confidence: Becky was shamed into losing weight after being horrified by a picture of herself in her bikini but now she is back in a skimpy two-piece for the first time in 18 months . Becky says she had always been a slender size eight through her teens and twenties but noticed the weight creep after moving to Catral, Spain with her husband Jason, 41, in 2008. At her heaviest, Becky weighed 11 stone and was wearing size 14 clothes. She said: 'I tried to be careful about what I ate but the weight crept up. I'd restrict myself to a tin of tomato soup or beans on toast in the day but at night I would sink endless glasses of wine and munch on crisps and chocolate. 'I hated my body more than anything and I hate the way it made me feel. I ended up being so negative despite living in our Spanish paradise. Working out: For the next four months Becky spent five to six days each week in the gym at spin and circuit classes and then teamed up with husband Jay to train with weights . 'My turnaround really came in 2011 when I was looking at photographs taken from the summer. I decided enough was enough and I had to do something.' For the next four months Becky spent five to six days each week in the gym at spin and circuit classes and then teamed up with husband Jay to train with weights. And she continued after they moved back to the UK in November last year. She said: 'The weights area was surrounded by mirrors and I couldn't bear to look at myself but Jason was so supportive, he really helped me. 'With weight training I was able to burn more calories and within three months I'd lost a stone, the rest fell off really quickly. Support system: Becky says her husband Jason, 41, was so supportive and really helped her after she became too insecure to even look in the mirror . 'I began reading up on female weight training and changed my diet. Before then I was starving myself but I began eating more protein and carbs and fats. 'I even went up to six meals a day and made sure I had lots of vegetables and natural food - never any packets or ready meals.

Space experts said the eery ring (pictured) is an artifact caused by the scattering of light inside the camera . Incredible new images of one of Mars' moons rising in the sky have been taken by Nasa's Curiosity rover based on the red planet. The exploration vehicle, which is fitted with a navigation camera, took 86 photos of Phobos rising after sunset on 28 June. They were transformed into a video by Nasa employees back on Earth. While the video is just 32 seconds long, it shows the remarkable moonrise, which actually lasted 27 minutes. Nasa experts at its Jet Propulsion Laboratory said the eery ring seen in the video is an artifact caused by the scattering of light inside the camera. Phobos, the moon seen in the video, measures just 14 miles wide but Mars' only other moon, Deimos is even more diminutive. Many astronomers believe that the two tiny moons are actually old asteroids snared by Mars' gravity millions of years ago. The strange video of the Martian moonrise was shared on the Curiosity Twitter feed in a post that read: 'You asked for the moon. Here it is! See footage from my Navcam of Mars' moon Phobos rising.' Nasa's Curiosity rover landed on Mars last August. It began its two-year tour to explore whether Mars ever supported microbial life, from the enormous Gale Crater. Nasa scientists controlling the robotic vehicle reported in March that a site called Yellowknife Bay could have supported life billions of years ago. Phobos, the moon seen in the video and pictured here, measures just 14 miles wide but Mars' only other moon, Deimos is even more diminutive. Many astronomers believe that the two tiny moons are actually old asteroids snared by Mars' gravity millions of years ago . While the rover has stuck close to its landing site so far, it is now on its way to its final destination, Mount Sharp. The strange mountain towers over the centre of Gales Crater by almost three and a half miles. It is of interest to scientists because its layers of rock can reveal information about the planet's changing environment over time. The video is not the first observation of Phobos made by the Curiosity rover. It took a photograph of the mini moon as it crossed the sun just five weeks after landing on the red planet last year. Nasa released the first official images captured by its Curiosity rover showing the surface of Mars in crystal clear detail last month. The space agency created a panorama made up of one billion pixels stitched together from nearly 900 exposures taken by cameras on-board Curiosity.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . PUBLISHED: . 10:30 EST, 5 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:59 EST, 6 July 2013 . Scientists believe our galaxy could contain a staggering 60 billion planets that might be capable of supporting life. Based on data from NASA's Kepler spacecraft, scientists had predicted there should be one Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of each red dwarf, the most common type of star. But a group of researchers has now doubled that estimate after considering how cloud cover might help an alien planet support life. Cloud cover is crucial for life, as clouds not only reflect sunlight to cool things off - they keep the planet warm enough to sustain life. Scroll down for video . A planet with clouds and surface water orbits a red dwarf star in this artist's illustration of the Gliese 581 star system. New findings from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University show that planets orbiting red dwarf stars are more likely to be habitable than previously believed . A new study by the University of Chicago and Northwestern University said that the Milky Way alone could contain 60 billion planets orbiting red dwarf stars that could support life. It also suggests new ways for astronomers to test whether planets orbiting red dwarfs have cloud cover. The researchers based their study, which appeared in Astrophysical Journal Letters, on rigorous computer simulations of cloud behaviour on alien planets. This cloud behaviour dramatically expanded the estimated habitable zone of red dwarfs, which are much smaller and fainter than stars like the sun. Dorian Abbot, assistant professor in geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago, said: 'Clouds cause warming and they cause cooling on Earth. 'They reflect sunlight to cool things off and they absorb infrared radiation from the surface to make a greenhouse effect. 'That's part of what keeps the planet warm enough to sustain life.' The planets believed capable of supporting life fall in habitable zones where they are the right temperature to be able to have liquid water on their surfaces - a requirement of life as we know it. As red dwarf stars are slightly cooler and less bright than our sun, the planets are usually closer to their star. An illustration of simulated cloud coverage (white) on a tidally locked planet (blue) that would orbit a red dwarf star. Planetary scientists at UChicago and Northwestern are applying global climate simulations to problems in astronomy . Nicolas Cowan, another author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University, said: 'If you're orbiting around a low mass or dwarf star, you have to orbit about once a month or once every two months to receive the same amount of sunlight that we receive from the sun.' As the orbit of these habitable planets around a red dwarf is tight, they are tidally locked, so that one side of the planet always faces the star. Therefore anything living on one of these planets would enjoy continual daylight. The researchers used 3D simulations to model how air would move over a planet tidally locked with a dwarf star. Mr Cowan said: 'There’s no way you can do clouds properly in one dimension. 'But in a three dimensional model, you’re actually simulating the way air moves and the way moisture moves through the entire atmosphere of the planet.' They found that if water was found on the surface of a planet it would result in clouds. These clouds would gather on the star-facing side of the planet where it is always noon. Their position would have a cooling effect on the inner ring of the habitable zone, enabling the planets to have water on their surfaces, even though they are much closer to their red dwarfs than the Earth is to the sun. Clouds exert a major influence on Earth's climate. If clouds only cooled the planet by reflecting solar energy back to space, Earth (pictured) would completely ice over. But if clouds only warmed the planet by absorbing and reemitting infrared energy back to the surface, Earth would fry under a runaway greenhouse effect like the one on Venus .

An Illinois man has set the bar rather high for other men with a creative proposal to his now-fiancee in a local movie theater. Jake and Kristen had been together for about two years when they made a fateful trip to their local cinema, where they routinely see a film together almost every week. This time was different though: they were the coming attraction. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Movie date: Jake and Kristen's regular movie night proved more momentous than usual . Previews: Jake is looking on edge while Kristen, blissfully unaware, leans back into her chair . Jake told his friend Brock Newell that he wanted to propose to Kristen with a movie trailer, and the two concocted a plot based on how Jake and Kristen met, their first fight, all the way through to a romantic proposal. Directed and produced by Newell, the trailer begins just like any other. Kristen can be seen as it begins staring expectantly at the screen while Jake beside her gnaws on his fingernails. So far, so normal: Jake's movie-trailer proposal begins . The trailer documents the couple's first meeting, when they were each performing wingman/woman duties for their respective friends. As movie-trailer Jake tells movie-trailer Kristen that he'll buy her a tequila if she can convince another bar patron to let her wear his sombrero, the penny drops and Kristen can be seen clutching Jake's arm and staring at him disbelievingly. Their friends never quite hit it off that night, but after a couple of tequilas, Jake and Kristen were enamored. Curbed enthusiasm: Neither Kristen nor Jake were particularly keen to meet one another . Let's just get this over with: Kristen and Jake were initially frosty until a couple of tequilas loosened them up . As the trailer moves on to movie-trailer Kristen talking on the phone about her meeting with Jake, Kristen can be seen laughing and Jake is beginning to look relieved and somewhat pleased with himself. 'Next year, you'll find that to get comfortable with someone, you have to first get uncomfortable,' intones the voice-over. The trailer covers the relationship's ups and downs, from hoping for a best friend's approval and getting a bit tipsy in the attempt (cue real-Kristen burying her face in Jake's arm) to their argument about Jake's constant lateness. Smitten: Movie-trailer Kristen tells a friend she is 'like, so enamored' of Jake while the real Kristen cracks up . Sorry not sorry: The couple has a fight about Jake's lateness but his apology leaves a lot to be desired - Kirsten in the movie theater seems to remember it well . 'This is a story about letting go of the petty wants and holding on to the deep connection,' says the voice-over as a montage of Jake-and-Kristen couple moments plays out. Finally, after a confession to a friend that he realized Kristen was 'the one' when she bought him a blender for Christmas - even though he hadn't told anyone how much he wanted one because he was embarrassed - Jake gets down to business. Uncanny: The actress playing Kristen has definitely got her reactions down-pat as she is proposed to by movie-trailer Jake . Hollywood moment: Jake proposes to Kristen as cinema patrons watch on . Engaged: The real life couple of this 'perfectly imperfect' love story . 'For this perfectly imperfect love story to happen, it all depends on one thing, and one thing only,' says the voiceover as movie-trailer Jake gets down on one knee. In the cinema, Jake takes Kristen's hands and does the same. She responds with a muffled, 'Duh!' and they kiss and hug ecstatically.

Sleepless nights are the bane of new parents and it seems that Zac Goldsmith and his wife Alice have had more than a few lately. With his newborn baby safely tucked up in a carrycot and an exhausted smile on his face, Richmond MP Zac, 38, headed off to enjoy the sunshine in his eco-friendly car accompanied by Alice, 27, who wore a pretty pink striped vest and a comfortable pair of leggings. The baby, who was born just four months after the couple's March wedding, is Mrs Goldsmith's first child, although Zac has three children - Uma Romaine, Thyra and James - from his previous marriage to Sheherazade Bentley. New parents: Zac and Alice Goldsmith looked tired as they left the house with their newborn baby . The MP and environmental campaigner will have plenty of time to spend with his youngest child when Parliament breaks for summer next month, although some of that will probably be spent introducing his new baby to his or her three half-siblings. Zac and his former wife divorced in 2010 amid rumours surrounding the MP and his current wife, who is the sister of Ben Goldsmith's former wife, Kate Rothschild. The first Rothschild-Goldsmith marriage imploded spectacularly last year when Kate ran off with US rapper, Jay Electronica. Ben, who is now dating PR girl, Jemima Jones, reacted furiously to the affair and the police were allegedly called to an altercation at the couple's West London home.

Cancer charities and MPs today condemned the government for shelving plans to firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets. Ministers were accused of putting jobs in the tobacco industry ahead of saving lives. One Tory MP said it was a 'day of shame' for the government which meant 'more lives ruined for political expediency'. Shelved: England will not follow Australia in introducing plain cigarette packaging . Delay: Laws passed in Australia mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking, but the UK government will not follow suit . Health campaigners had urged the government to follow Australia which this year became the only country to adopt plain . packaging, all cigarette packs are drab green. Research suggests . non-smokers and young people find less appealing. But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has decided not to introduce the same rules in England, claiming there is not enough evidence it would have a significant impact. Questions were also raised about the role played by Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby, whose lobbying firm has worked for the tobacco industry. The UK government has spent a year considering a ban, and health ministers were understood to be keen to go ahead. But it was not included in the Queen's Speech in May, and now the idea has been kicked into the long grass. A Whitehall source said: ‘Only . Australia has done it so far and they only did it at the end of last . year. So it is not clear yet whether or not it would actually have any . effect. It is very hard to tell, which is why it is being shelved for . now.’ Smoking causes over . 100,000 deaths a year in the UK. Last April, displaying cigarettes in . supermarkets was banned, and this will be extended to all other shops . from April 2015. Row: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was accused of putting jobs in the tobacco industry ahead of saving lives . David Cameron supported plain packs at first, but the Government has cooled on the idea. While health groups have called it a ‘golden opportunity’ to cut smoking-related disease, industry insiders say plain packs will lead to more counterfeit cigarettes and less tax revenue. Some Tory MPs condemned it as a ‘nanny state’ measure. Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer . Research UK, heavily criticised the decision to shelve plain packaging, . warning concerns about the impact on the tobacco industry would cost . lives. Every year 200,000 children in the UK were 'lured' into starting smoking, he added. 'This . decision is bitterly disappointing and lives will be lost as a result. We can't stand by and watch as these lives are lost,' Dr Kumar said. 'The . Government has stalled in the face of strong evidence and instead . reacted to myths perpetuated by the tobacco industry, an industry . well-known for suppressing the truth about its lethal products. Prime Minister David Cameron has abandoned a ban on multi-buy drink offers. It means two-for-one or supermarket ‘meal deals’ with free wine will continue to be available. There were fears . a ban would affect responsible consumers rather than problem drinkers. The Home Office is expected to shelve the idea next week along with plans for a minimum alcohol price per unit of 45p. A Government source said the ideas were ‘dead and buried’. Instead, selling alcohol below cost price, or the rate of duty plus VAT, will be banned – affecting only a handful of products. 'The Government had a choice: protect children from an addiction that kills 100,000 people in the UK every year or protect tobacco industry profits. We believe it has made the wrong choice. There’s strong public support for standard packs; we urge the Government to act now, without further delay.' Dr Sarah Wollaston, a Tory MP and former GP, condemned the decision as a 'tragic waste of an opportunity'. She claimed there would be 'more lives ruined for political expediency'. Writing . on Twitter, Dr Wollaston added: 'R.I.P public health. A day of shame . for this government; the only winners big tobacco, big alcohol and big . undertakers.' Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the . British Lung Foundation, said: 'It is bewildering that the UK government . is still allowing the tobacco industry to target young people by . refusing to introduce standardised packaging. 'The time has surely now come for the . government to stop dithering on this issue. Using expensively-designed . packaging to sell cigarettes to young people is wrong and should be . stopped.' However Tory . MP Mark Field welcomed the decision to postpone plans for plain . packaging for cigarettes until it could be proved to cut take up of . smoking among young people. 'There are two main concerns, one is that essentially . any decision really must be unequivocally evidence-based...and to . contemplate letting these very significant measures the evidence base . has to be absolutely rock solid and reliable and to date it’s not,' he told BBC Radio 4. 'There is this additional issue and one that can't be ignored, which is . that there are substantial intellectual property rights that are being . stripped away by removing brand rights, which are going to cost the . Exchequer significant sums of money in compensation. 'I'm also very much . of the view that we have got to be laser-like in our approach towards . getting the economy out of recession, getting the deficit down and this . sort of message and regulation such as this really runs counter to our . view that we are entirely open to business.' Not enough evidence: Whitehall said it was not clear whether plain packaging had any deterrent effect . In the Commons, Public Health Minister Anna Soubry insisted the Government’s position on plain packaging had not changed, but she refused to to be drawn on how long ministers would wait before deciding whether to press ahead. 'We have to wait to see the evidence as it emerges. I’m afraid it’s how long is a piece of string,' she said. The Labour party questioned the involvement in the decision to drop plain packaging of Mr Crosby, whose PR and lobbying firm Crosby Textor was on a retainer for British American Tobacco when the industry was trying to block plain packet laws in Australia. Diane Abbott, a shadow health minister, said: 'The Tories used to say there were in favour of this policy, that children should be protected. 'But now, not long after employing Lynton Corsby, a strategist linked to lobbying in the tobacco industry, David Cameron is backing down. 'People will rightly wonder if the Government is breaking its promise, despite the medical evidence and the wishes of British families, in order to please its friends in big business. 'David Cameron needs to explain why he’s doing it, when he decided, whether Lynton Crosby had any input into the decision, and whether he was aware of Lynton Crosby’s alleged business interests when he appointed him.' Mr Cameron has repeatedly insisted that has 'never been lobbied by Lynton Crosby about anything'. Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, who was instrumental in bringing about packaging reforms in Australia, claimed the Government was “putting business interests in front of public health. He told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme: 'I think the British Government are being very disingenuous in saying let’s see what happens in Australia. 'It’s going to probably take them a good many years to see whether or not there has been an accelerated downturn.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'This is an important decision and we make no apology for taking time to get it right.'","Ministers have spent a year considering introducing plain packaging .

Staff at a children’s play centre called police when a father defied their order not to sing Happy Birthday to his young daughter during a party. Colm Doherty was told his group was not allowed to sing the song as they had not paid for a ‘birthday package’. Despite spending £300 on food, drinks and entry fees for his daughter Cara’s eighth birthday, a staff member tried to intervene as the group lit candles on a cake and began to sing. Outraged: Colm Doherty (pictured with his daughter Cara) was in shock and disbelief when he was told to blow out the candles on his 8-year-old's birthday cake and stop singing happy birthday because he hadn't booked with Clownton's sold-out birthday package . When Mr Doherty, 47, stood in front of the receptionist to stop her from interrupting and ‘upsetting’ the party of 18 children she contacted police. Officers were given CCTV footage of the incident at the Clowntown children’s centre but have taken no action against Mr Doherty. The heating engineer, who lives with his wife Marie, 49, and their six children in Cricklewood, North-West London, described the centre’s actions as ‘utter madness’. Clowntown said it was ‘against company policy’ for people to sing Happy Birthday on the premises without having specifically booked a party. Mrs Doherty had contacted Clowntown to enquire about booking a birthday party for 20 children and six adults but was told there was no availability. The family decided to visit the centre in Muswell Hill anyway.  After arriving they noticed two of the ‘party booths’ were not being used, and a female staff member said they could use one. But the woman later told the group she was ‘in fairly big trouble’ for letting them use the room when they had not booked it and said they should not ‘produce a cake or sing Happy Birthday’. Mr Doherty refused, saying he was not going to let the centre ‘put a downer’ on his youngest child’s party. The family brought their own cake in accordance with Clowntown’s policy that ‘You bring the cake, we do the rest’, but did not eat it on the premises. By the book: Staff at Clowntown children's centre in Muswell Hill confronted the party of 18 children. They called the police when they say Mr Doherty displayed an 'aggressive attitude' ‘When the cake came out you could sense a bit of nervous tension among the staff, and one particular lady came storming down and told us that we could not sing and to put the cake away,’ Mr Doherty said. He said he stood in front of her to shield the children and told her to go away. He added that he was left in ‘shock and disbelief’ by the centre’s actions and said the other six parents in the group were ‘fuming’. Clowntown’s manager Ian Slazenger said it is their policy that ‘you don’t celebrate a birthday party on our premises unless it is the package you obtain’. He added: ‘There were four other groups and we did not want them to see that people can just come in and celebrate a birthday without respecting our policy.’ Mr Slazenger claimed Mr Doherty’s group was offered a birthday package but chose not to take it. However, he admitted they spent more on entry fees and food than if they had used the birthday service, which costs between £7.50 and £15 per child. He claimed that a staff member contacted police because Mr Doherty had displayed an ‘aggressive attitude’, pointed his finger at her face and took photographs of her. Mr Doherty denies he was aggressive and said he took pictures of the woman who tried to stop the group from singing Happy Birthday so he could identify her for a subsequent complaint. A police spokesman confirmed that officers had spoken to Mr Doherty at Clowntown, but said no formal action was taken.","Colm Doherty, 47 spent more than £300 for daughter Cara's eighth birthday at Clowntown Children's centre .

A long-serving special education teacher is being investigated after sending an offensive email from her work account describing her students as 'maggots' and monkeys'. Connecticut's Gwendolyn Fenton is on paid leave from Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School in Hartford after a May email in which she criticized her special needs students was exposed. 'I am having an awful day with the monkeys I am supposed to teach,' Fenton wrote. 'I would have a better time teaching gorillas to sign than this maggets (sic).' Confrontation: A reporter confronts special education teacher Gwendolyn Fenton, pictured answering the door of her Hartford home, over why she called her students maggots . Shocking: Teacher Gwendolyn Fenton used her work email to complain that her students were 'monkeys' and 'maggots' Fenton admitted she sent the email - obtained exclusively by FOX CT through an open records request - out of frustration. 'I’m embarrassed. That’s not who I am. 'I don’t know how it was given to you but it is not what the district . expects of me and not what I expected for myself,' she told FOX CT.

Medina said Fenton has been placed on administrative leave with pay . while she is being investigated. Fenton has worked at numerous schools for special needs students in Hartford over several decades. Assistant Child Advocate Mickey Kramer from the State’s Office of the Child Advocate slammed the teacher's comments. 'I feel sick that any school person and educator, particularly a special educator would ever, ever, express such a thought about children,' Kramer told FOX CT. Defensive: Former student Devon Palmer backed Fenton, saying it was common for teachers to complain about students . However student Devon Palmer defended Fenton, insisting it's common for teachers to complain about students as behavior problems are so widespread. 'She’s a very wonderful teacher. She’s wonderful,' he said. 'I didn’t know she would write something like that but I can honestly think that she would say something like that because she gets mad. 'Those students I remember one time, they almost jumped her.' However this is not the first time Fenton has come under fire. In August 1995, The Courant reported she had been charged with marijuana possession in June after intercepting a package in the mail. Police dropped the charges due to alack of evidence and she was allowed to keep working at the Oak Hill School, a program run by the Connecticut Institute for the Blind.","Special ed teacher Gwendolyn Fenton is being investigated after calling her students 'maggots' and 'monkeys' in an email .

A father has been jailed for eight years after his seven-week-old daughter died from a 'chilling catalogue of injuries'. Lee Davison, 29, was sentenced on Friday after being found guilty of causing or allowing the death of his daughter Kristal. The tiny baby died on April 13 last year after being rushed to hospital from their home with bleeding behind the eyes, brain damage and broken ribs and legs. Lee Davison (right) was jailed for eight years after he was found guilty of causing or allowing the death of his baby daughter Kristal (left) who suffered a 'chilling catalogue of injuries ' Mr Justice Andrew Smith told Davison, who wept in the dock as he was sentenced, that although it could not be said he had caused his daughter's death, he had failed to protect her. He told Davison, who has 11 previous convictions for 15 offences, that he must have been aware his daughter was suffering and was therefore responsible for allowing Kristal to die. Kristal's mother, Jessica Hopkinson, was cleared of the same charge following a four-week trial at Leeds Crown Court. The judge told Davison: 'Even if you didn't injure her yourself, I'm sure you must have been aware of these [injuries] by the beginning of April. 'You did nothing and you should have done. You bear responsibility because you knew she was being hurt and couldn't face up to doing anything about it. Kristal's mother Jessica Hopkinson was cleared of all charges after a trial . 'If you, her father, had protected her, she would have lived. 'Your sentence must reflect her suffering, in particular the last two weeks of  her life.' The judge said that in the first . three weeks of her shot life, Kristal suffered damage to her femur and . head, which caused bleeding behind the eyes. He said the 'chilling catalogue of injuries' showed Kristal was seriously hurt on at least five occasions. Davison called an ambulance on the morning of April 12 last year reporting that Kristal was gasping for breath at their home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire. When . paramedics arrived, the baby was found to be pale, limp and lifeless . and was taken to hospital, where she died the following day. Mr Justice Smith said: 'Around the second week of March she suffered rib fractures - 12 in total. 'Around the time she was squeezed by somebody holding her under the arms, probably someone acting out of anger and temper. Two bones in her left leg were broken. 'And she suffered bone damage - her skull was broken - someone had hit or banged her head on something hard. 'She suffered bleeding in her eyes and brain by shaking.' The judge said Hopkinson was the 'dominant character' in the house and was abusive to his partner, who is nearly ten years younger than him. He said: 'She was young. She had no confidence about being a mother or anything else. 'At times you were abusive and violent towards her. You couldn't keep your  temper and you took it out on her. 'I'm not saying you never had any real affection for her. I think in your way you did. 'I also think you were pleased when Krystal was born and you were generally fond of her.' Justice Andrew Smith told Davison at Leeds Crown Court that Kristal would have lived if he had protected her . He accepted that Davison is of a low intellect, but said that he must have been aware of the injuries adding: 'It really would beggar belief and defy the jury's verdict if it were any other way.' Hopkinson and Davison started a . relationship in early 2011 with Hopkinson falling pregnant in May that . year, after which they were seen by social workers. The court was told that Davison had previously been given community orders after beating up a former girlfriend on three occasions. In August 2004, when he was 20, he pleaded guilty to common assault. In June 2006, when he was 21, he pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm, after he headbutted his then girlfriend - knocking her unconscious. And on a third occasion, in May 2007, he was given a community order for assault occasioning actual bodily harm after he rowed with his then-girlfriend over a pizza. He pushed her into a wall, and when she struck out at him to defend herself, he punched her in the face, causing her to fall onto the floor - where he continued to strike her. She was left with broken ribs after the attack.","Lee Davison found guilty of causing or allowing death of daughter Kristal .

Zara, 32, joined other members of the royal family, as well as the entire Middleton clan to watch a gala performance of music and dance from throughout the Queen's reign as part of the Coronation Festival, in her first public appearance since revealing she was pregnant. Zara chose a loose fitting silk tunic dress with a floral design, which conveniently shielded her growing baby bump . Zara seemed to enjoy the evening, and was seen catching up with cousin Princess Eugenie (left)in the royal box at the Gala, which was held in the gardens at Buckingham Palace . The 32-year-old looked relaxed and radiant, keeping her make-up and accessories simple . The sleeved silk tunic dress featured a navy décolletage and a white panel with an intricate floral design on it. The stylish loosing fitting choice, which fell to knee length, also served to conceal her growing bump from the world’s cameras. Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall were on Centre Court to watch the men's singles final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last week . Zara, on Mr Murt, took part in the Cross Country during day three of the Barbury International Horse Trials at Barbury Castle, Wiltshire . With her blonde hair lose round her shoulders, and simple make up Zara looked fresh faced and confident as she mingled at the event. She kept accessories to a minimum with diamond studs in her ears, and just a silver watch and her wedding ring adorning her hands. Fellow pregnant royal the Duchess of Cambridge has certainly set the bar high in terms of maternity fashion. Kate has not set a foot wrong throughout her pregnancy, effortlessly mixing comfort with classic cuts and pretty floral colours. Kate has set an example in how to dress when pregnant, maintain an elegant sense of style throughout . The Duchess was not at the event last night, as she expected to give birth imminently, with her official due date being tomorrow.

The Queen was joined by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at the festival to mark the 60th anniversary of her coronation . Zara, who was part of the Olympic medal-winning British eventing team last summer, has come under fire for insisting she will carry on competing in top class horse trials despite her pregnancy. During the gala last night a member of the Royal Warrant Holders Association even unveiled a figure of Zara Phillips riding her horse, Toytown, much to the obvious delight of the Queen. Although the NHS advises pregnant women not to continue with ‘inherently risky’ sports such as horse riding, former world champion Miss Phillips was competing at the Barbury International Horse Trials at the weekend. Miss Phillips, who is believed to be three months pregnant, came off her horse at one point, but was later described as ‘fine’. A spokesman for Miss Phillips, as she is still known professionally, said she would carry on competing for several weeks at least. She is currently entered into three events later this month, with rides on six horses. Catherine has mixed classic styles with pastel shades . With a royal arrival on the way and her . pregnancy drawing to a close, it seems Kate can add 'maternity fashion . ambassador' to her list of titles. It may almost be time for the Duchess of Cambridge to hang up her pregnancy . clothes, but her influence on maternity fashion is here to stay, . according to a recent poll of over 500 UK mothers. A massive 81 per cent of UK mothers have chosen Kate Middleton as the ‘best dressed pregnant celebrity’ over celebrities including Katie Price and Kim Kardashian. The poll has revealed that the Duchess beat Katie Price (7 per cent), Kim Kardashian (6 per cent), Kate Winslet (4 per cent), Caprice (1 per cent) and Fergie (1 per cent) from the Black Eyed Peas to the title. Over the past 9 months, mothers have fallen in love with Kate's chic style, from her pastel coloured dresses to her signature high heels. While dressing tastefully, Kate has remained youthful in three-quarter length sleeves and gowns slit to the thigh. Kate is well-known for mixing couture with high street labels such as Topshop, LK Bennett, Reiss and Zara. The down-to-earth Duchess has also been praised for recycling her outfits, such as the sell-out £38 Topshop dress she wore on a tour of the Harry Potter film studios and again to a friend's wedding. The Duchess's demure . style could not be more different from that of runners-up Katie Price . and Kim Kardashian. Katie, who has hinted that she is expecting twins, . recently showed off her bump in an outfit designed to look like a huge . pair of lips, while Kim, whose baby is due this month, was recently . snapped in a cut-out, cleavage-enhancing mini dress. Kate is well-known for mixing couture with high street labels such as Topshop, LK Bennett, Reiss and Zara . 'We're not at all surprised that the Duchess won a landslide victory,' says Jas Uppal of RebelRebelClothing.co.uk who conducted the poll in partnership with Babies.co.uk. 'Ordinary mums are tired of seeing stars flaunt their pregnancy for the magazines and admire Kate’s classic elegance.' The Duchess beat Kim Kardashian (left) and Katie Price (right) to the top spot . So how can women achieve their winner's look at home? 'A Kate-inspired pastel coloured dress teamed with a smart black jacket and clutch is a great summer look and one that every mum can pull off,' recommends Jas. According to James Macfarlane, Managing Director of Babies.co.uk, 'Kate Middleton's influence on our users has been far stronger than any other celebrity in living memory and I think mums will be referring to her as a style icon for at least the next twenty years.'","Zara joined other royals at the Coronation Festival Gala at the palace .

A 97-year-old great grandmother died after being forced to wait 40 hours for stitches while junior doctors argued over who was responsible for her. Josephine Lakin fell out of her bed and cut her head on a short-staffed ward and was only discovered when a cleaner found her in a cramped side room. It then took doctors at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre four days to she had also broken her knee in the fall. Her devastated family have now received an apology from NHS bosses after they admitted there catalogue of failures in the lead up to her death on October 16, 2011. Mrs Lakin had initially been admitted to hospital on October 10 with an infection. However, the day after she was admitted she fell out of bed and cut her head. It took medics almost two days to stitch up the cut because of a 'disagreement' between junior surgeons and they also failed to realise that she had broken her knee. She died two weeks later. A post mortem examination revealed her cause of death to be congestive cardiac failure and the fracture to her left leg. The widow's devastated family pushed for an investigation into the death and this week received a letter of apology from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospital. Her relatives have now condemned the level of care she received at the hospital and urged for elderly patients to be treated with more dignity in future. Granddaughter Mandy Flint, 43, from Bilborough, Nottinghamshire, said the family first knew something was wrong when they got a midnight phone call from the hospital about the fall. She said: ‘We could not understand it. ‘She had been unable to walk for the past three years and had never fallen from her chair at home. ‘She didn't have the strength to move herself, so how could she have fallen? That was all I was thinking. Mrs Lakin was admitted to the hospital with an infection but fell out of bed the next day. She cut her head but it took medics two days to stitch it up because of a 'disagreement' ‘But it was when I saw her on the hospital ward that the shock set in. ‘She looked like she had been beaten up. Both of her eyes were black and she had a large cut on her head. ‘She didn't deserve to die like this. You think you can have faith in the way people are treated in hospital - but you can't. ‘They let her down. And we've had to live with the mistakes. ‘We don't want any more people to be treated the way she was. ‘I always thought that she would have lived to 100-years-old had it not been for this fall. Her granddaughter, Mandy Flint (pictured), says that she also broke her leg when she fell out of bed but that it took doctors four days to realise . ‘Since her death we have found it difficult to cope with what she went through. ‘We are not interested in compensation, we just want to make sure that no one else goes through what she did.’ The report also found there was a lack of a proper assessment of the risk she would fall from her bed. When interviewed, nurses admitted that the ward was understaffed, too reliant on agency workers, and that record-keeping and communication were poor. A post mortem examination revealed that Mrs Lakin (pictured after her fall) died from heart failure and a broken leg . An inquest into Mrs Lakin’s death recorded a verdict of accidental death. The Trust has since issue an 'unreserved' apology and admitted failing to meet required care standards. In a letter to the family chief executive Peter Homa said: ‘I deeply regret that Mrs Lakin died in such circumstances and that there were so many areas of our care which fell below the standard that we would expect. ‘I apologise unreservedly for the shortcomings in care Mrs Lakin received from the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.’ The Trust made a number of recommendations in the wake of its investigations - including a thorough review of communication protocols and operating procedures on the ward. It also ordered staff draw up clear lines of responsibility for the assessment and stitching of wounds sustained in falls. The use of agency staff was recommended to be kept to a minimum, and the review also said staff should be reminded of the need to keep clear and detailed notes. Nottinghamshire Coroner Mairin Casey said she felt the Trust had improved its record on falls from hospital beds. She said: ‘Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust has shown a raised awareness of the issue of falls within their hospitals. ‘They have taken careful note of the difficulties they have faced and how they have been addressing those difficulties, looking the issues generally and as part of a learning process when patients have fallen resulting in serious injuries or even death. ‘Over this two-year period we have seen huge improvements in the trust's efforts to minimise falls including work done to formulate clear policies and procedures and risk assessments.’ Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre has apologised to Mrs Lakin's family and says that it has made a number of improvements since her death . Mr Homa said: 'I wish to reiterate the Trust’s deepest apologies to Mrs Lakin’s family that she fell when in our care and sustained serious injuries. 'The cause of the fall and wider concerns about Mrs Lakin’s care were thoroughly investigated, and the findings and our improvement actions shared with her family in March 2012.'We appreciate that some patients, particularly those who are frail and confused patients, are at high risk of falling in the unfamiliar surroundings of a hospital. 'We have a very active programme across our wards to reduce the number of falls and associated injuries. 'The Coroner is satisfied with the steps the Trust is taking to prevent falls. Indeed, the Coroner has commended our work and improvement, and continues to take a keen interest in these matters.'","Josephine Lakin was admitted to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre .

Keith McDonald pleaded guilty to assault against his former partner Clare Bryant and their three-year-old child in a spat over sunglasses . A love rat, who has allegedly fathered 11 children with 10 different women, kicked and punched his former partner before flinging open a fridge door and hitting their three-year-old daughter's head, following a spat over sunglasses. Keith McDonald attacked his ex-lover Clare Bryant at her home in Houghton-Le-Spring, County Durham, before opening the fridge door which injured the toddler. Ms Bryant, who has two children with unemployed McDonald, suffered cuts and scratches in the row. Despite pleading not guilty to two charges of assault, McDonald admitted committing the offences on June 11 before Sunderland Magistrates' Court on Friday. Paul Doney, prosecuting, described how McDonald came round to drop off some money while the victim was getting her daughters, aged two and three, ready. He said: 'She asked him to go away, then he asked for his sunglasses and was asked by the injured party to stay where he was while she got them. 'He tried to push past her, then grabbed her hair and pulled her down before kicking her in the face and punching her to the head. 'He was pushed back towards the yard as a neighbour shouted at them. 'The defendant again asked for his sunglasses. She was going to get them and call the police.' The pair then argued about her owing his uncle money for a fridge and he vowed to 'wreck' it. McDonald, of Springwell Road, Sunderland, then flung the fridge door open, hitting the three-year-old on the back of the head. Mr Doney said: 'She ran at him and forced him out of the house and threw his sunglasses at him. In happier times: Keith McDonald, who is rumoured to have fathered 11 children with 10 different women, pictured with former partner Clare Bryant in 2009 . 'Both she and her daughter went to hospital. She had a three to four inch graze on her neck and cuts on her hand. 'Her daughter was not physically injured but her head was hot, believed to be due to the impact from the fridge door.' Miss Bryant, in a statement read out to the court, said: 'All I could think, when Keith was punching me to the face, was ""oh my God, I hope the bruises don't show when I take the bairns to school.""' Gavin Sword, defending McDonald, told the court he had a 'slightly different version of events' to his ex. Mr Sword said: 'He said they had been back together and living together as man and wife for about two weeks. 'He was leaving and she did not want him to leave and that was the reason for the struggle. Keith Macdonald pleaded guilty to the charges at Sunderland Magistrates' Court . 'He accepts there was a struggle and in the course of that struggle, he caused the injuries she has stated in her account, with the possible exception of the cut on her right hand, which he does not accept he caused initially. 'The struggle was taking place in the doorway. A sharp nail was sticking out and he thinks she cut her hand on that.' Mr Sword said that McDonald, who has a history of violence against women, had not intended to hit the little girl, but accepted his actions were reckless and was seeking help managing his anger. McDonald was granted conditional bail while a Probation Service report was prepared, looking at all options, including a jail term. Jean Brown, chairman of the bench, told him he must obey an electronically-monitored curfew between 7pm to 7am.","Keith Macdonald kicked and punched former partner Claire Bryant during an argument over his sunglasses .

In trouble: Christopher McGowan, 50, pictured outside Truro Crown Court, was jailed today for hiring a JCB to destroy his former home . A bankrupt businessman who hired a JCB to reduce his former home to rubble because he faced eviction was jailed for two-and-a half years today. Property developer Christopher McGowan, 50, hired the mechanical digger before going on a £250,000 rampage inside the £470,000 six-acre property. He 'ripped the guts out' of Silver Bow Farm near Truro, Cornwall - stripping its fixtures and fittings and crashing through walls, doors, kitchen and bathroom units. McGowan carried out the 30 minute wrecking spree to 'punish' the new owners who were set to kick him out after he went bust, Truro Crown Court heard. He was found guilty of two counts of criminal damage and Judge Christopher Harvey Clark said the only fitting punishment for his 'vicious, spiteful act' was jail. 'You set about destroying Silver Bow Farm beyond economic repair. You hired a JCB from a local firm and smashed through the back of the property,' Judge Clark said. 'Silver Bow was left in ruins and I am told that the cost of the damage is just under a quarter of a million pounds. 'In my judgement what you did was a mean, spiteful, vicious act against people who had done you no harm and who had allowed you to stay in the property. 'Your actions were undoubtedly bitter and resentful and you resorted to desperate measures to cover up your indebtedness. 'There is no excuse for what you did. You did it out of spite.' Destruction: Silver Bow Farm in Cornwall after McGowan 'ripped the guts out' in 30 minutes of chaos . Bitter: The former owner used the JCB to smash down its walls and also took fixtures and fittings after being evicted . Prosecutor Philip Lee told Truro Crown Court that McGowan was declared bankrupt in 2009 when he was in negative equity with debts of more than half a million pounds. He was setting up a £1million deal with Wycliffe Estates Ltd, managed by Christopher Taylour, but it fell through when he failed to disclose his bankruptcy. It then emerged that he did not hold the legal title to Silver Bow Farm and was due to be evicted in September 2010. Eventually Mr Taylour's mother Janet Taylour bought the property for £470,000 in February 2011 from McGowan's mortgage lenders. The property developer was allowed to remain living there but could not pay his rent and an appeal against the eviction order failed in July 2012. Originally: Silver Bow Farm before McGowan decided to destroy it following an eviction by its new owners . Costly: The property with its six acres of land was bought for £470,000 after its former owner got into financial problems, Truro Crown Court heard . Upset: Bitter McGowan carried out the wrecking spree to 'punish' the new owners who were set to kick him out after he went bust . Mr Lee, speaking at a previous hearing, said the following month McGowan hired the JCB from a nearby construction firm and returned it within a hour. He told the court: 'On August 16 he hired a digger and returned it within 40 minutes. The nature and extent of the damage is such that it can only have been done deliberately. 'The defendant has the motive and the inclination to punish the Taylours. He must have been responsible for the damage. There is another reasonable explanation.' Police said the extent of the damage meant the house would probably have to be demolished. McGowan of Chacewater, Cornwall, had previously admitted fraud and forgery and was jailed for 30 months. He appeared for sentencing alongside hotelier Michael Owen, 53, of Truro, who had previously admitted assisting McGowan in trying to get Mrs Taylour to sign forged documents. Owen was handed a suspended six-month jail term and fined £500.","Christopher McGowan caused £250,000 of damage in just 30 minutes .

Their stone tools may have been simple and their dwellings made from simple straw huts, but ancient Britons were in fact ahead of the times - literally - when it came to the world's first ever calendar. That's the claim of archaeologists who believe they have found evidence of a giant 'year clock' capable of tracking lunar months and the changing seasons in a field near Banchory in Aberdeenshire. Dating back 10,000 years, it is twice the age of time-keeping systems created by the ancient Mesopotamians, which were thought to be the world's oldest. Time keepers: An ancient calendar found in a field near Banchory in Aberdeenshire, dates back 10,000 years . Speaking to the Sunday Times, Vincent Gaffney, professor of landscape archaeology at Birmingham University, said: 'The capacity to measure time if among the most important achievements of human societies and the issue of when time was ""created"" by humankind is critical in understanding how society developed.' Gaffney and his team analysed the findings of previous excavations at Warren Field, which had once been home to a Mesolithic (middle Stone Age) settlement in 8,000BC. A series of pits, perhaps used to hold large posts or stones, mystified archaeologists at the time. But the Birmingham University academics found the pits were aligned with key astronomical events, such as the phases of the moon and the midwinter sunrise. A full report will be released tomorrow, but among their findings is evidence suggesting this calendar could track the mid-winter sun. Many early calendars were designed to track calendar months, but could not tell users when a year had passed. This is because the lunar calendar differs from the amount of time taken for the Earth to orbit the sun. Ancient tribes failed to recognise this and so their calendars became increasingly out of step with the time of year as shown by the sun. Ancient clock: Stonehenge in Wiltshire, which dates to 2,400BC may have been used to track time . The Stone Age inhabitants in Aberdeenshire however noticed this problem and used their calendar to work out when the mid-winter solstice had arrived. They then used this information to 'reset' the lunar clock system. Gaffney said: 'The monument anticipates problems associated with simple lunar calendars by providing an annual astronomic correction in order to maintain the link between the passage of time, indicated by the moon, and the asynchronous solar year and associated seasons.' The use of a calendar also suggests the inhabitants of Warren Field were not just hunter-gathers but had something of a settled existence and wanted the ability to track time. It is close to the River Dee, where fish supplies were plentiful, and in the middle of forests full of game. Right on time: The Aztec Mayan Calendar was used by South American civilisations before 500BC . Gaffney added: 'This suggests that early hunter-gatherer societies in Scotland had both the need and ability to track time across the years - and perhaps within the month - and that this occurred 5,000 years before the first formal calendars were created in Mesopotamia. The Warren Field calendar predates a number of time tracking methods including Stonehenge, built in 2,400BC and which may have been used to track time. It is also older than the Mayan Calendar, established before 500BC and the 365-day Julian Calendar, introduced by Roman emperor Julius Caesar in 45BC. Caesar's legacy: The Roman emperor introduced the 365-day Julian calendar, which included leap years .","Stone Age Britons had a calendar 5,000 years before Mesopotamians .

Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, urges ministers to increase the NHS budget to GP services from nine to 10 per cent . The NHS could face a shortage of 16,000 GPs by 2021 unless the government ring-fences more funds for primary care, a leading doctor has warned. Currently, there is a shortfall of more than 8,300 GPs across the UK, but that it set to almost double if the rate of spending and budget cuts continues. Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said the NHS is facing a 'catastrophe' unless more funding is directed into he struggling service. Surgeries are already being stretched, she said, due to patients opting to visit their GP instead of attending accident and emergency departments. The number of A&E services has been cut in recent years and waits for non-urgent treatment, particularly non-life threatening accidents for example, can be long. NHS England last week said that unless things change, the NHS will face a black hole of £30 billion by 2021. Dr Gerada says this will equate to a £2.7billion squeeze on GP doctors - meaning a further shortfall of 7,500 GPs. Dr Gerada said: 'The fact that, in just eight years, we could see a shortfall of almost 16,000 GPs is truly shocking. 'General practice is at the heart of the NHS and if it is left to wither, as is the case now, it could sow the seeds of an unprecedented disintegration of the NHS, both in primary care and secondary care. 'Such is the key role that general practice plays, that if it starts to fall apart the impact will be felt across the rest of the health service – leading to longer waits in A&E and ever more last minute cancellations of elective surgery.' She urged ministers to do more to . protect healthcare budgets, and as such protect patient care,  by . 'immediately' increasing the funding for general practice by 10 per cent, 'as a first step'. She called for the government to work with GPs to help 'boost' the number of medical graduates going into general practice. 'Only by supporting general practice and . allowing it to treat more patients in the community, can the Government . protect the NHS from catastrophe – and ensure that the health service . can meet the projected health needs of the population.' 'Only by supporting it and allowing it to treat more patients in the community can they government protect the NHS from catastrophe,' she said. Currently, GP surgeries are allocated nine per cent of NHS cash but they are responsible for 90 per cent of patients' contact with the health service, the RCGP said. GPs have previously come under criticism for the high salaries they receive and the lack of services offered on the weekends. Dr Gerada called on the health secretary Jeremy Hunt to work with GPs to help boost the number of graduates choosing a career as a GP, as opposed to hospital positions . However, a recent poll, carried out by the RCGP, found that the community doctors work long days and are overstretched. The poll found that 55 per cent of . GPs conduct 40 to 60 patient consultations each day; 46 per cent say . they work at least 11 hours in surgery each day;  and 84 per cent say . their workload has increased substantially in the past five years. The poll found that 85 per cent of . GPs think general practice is 'in crisis', while half believe 'GPs can . no longer guarantee safe care to their patients'. The survey, conducted by Research Now in June, also revealed that 22 per cent of family doctors have had to seek support, guidance or advice for work-related stress, and that four in five GPs are more likely to want to quit the profession than they were five years ago.","GP surgeries currently face a shortage of 8,3000 doctors, says RCGP .

Nine Tory MPs have accepted free tickets to the opera and the Chelsea Flower Show from a giant tobacco company. Over the past two months alone, politicians took tickets worth almost £17,000 from Japan Tobacco International, which makes Silk Cut, Benson & Hedges, Camel and Old Holborn. The gifts illustrate the close connections between Conservative Party elements and firms that have lobbied successfully against Government plans for cigarettes to be sold in plain packets. Complimentary tickets: Japan Tobacco International gave MPs passes to the Chelsea Flower Show that cost between £1,133 and £1,260 . Freebies: Four MPs - two Conservative and two Labour - took tickets for last month's Glyndebourne opera festival at a country house in West Sussex . Embarrassingly for the Labour Party, three of its MPs accepted tickets as well. David Cameron has been accused of dropping the packaging proposals following lobbying from his Australian elections guru Lynton Crosby, whose firm works for global tobacco giant Philip Morris. Yesterday Paul Burstow, a Lib Dem former health minister, called for Mr Crosby to be sacked. And Labour’s Cabinet Office spokesman Jon Trickett pledged to lay amendments to a lobbying bill before Parliament this week. These would make senior figures working for politicians come clean about who they lobby for. The fact JTI is entertaining so many MPs will raise concerns it is trying to buy their support in Parliament. The Commons register of members’ interests reveals that seven Conservative MPs and one Labour MP accepted tickets for two to the Chelsea Flower Show from JTI in May. They are Tories Nigel Adams, Oliver Colville, Edward Garnier, Mark Pritchard, Laurence Robertson, Alec Shelbrooke and Angela Watkinson; and Labour’s Lindsay Hoyle. The MPs gave differing figures for the supposed value of the tickets, varying from £1,133 to £1,260. Mr Adams received Chelsea tickets on two successive days – May 22 and 23 – costing £1,188 and £1,050 plus VAT. A further four MPs – two Conservative and two Labour – took tickets for last month’s Glyndebourne  opera festival at a country house in West Sussex. Lobbying: Tory MPs including Angela Watkinson (left) and Alec Shelbrooke (right) from the tobacco firm. The gifts are said to show tobacco companies successfully lobbied against Government plans for cigarettes to be sold in plain packets . Across the board: Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle (left) and Tory MP Mark Pritchard both accepted gifts from the company . These were Christopher Chope and Bob Walter, both Tories; and Jim Dowd and Gerald Kaufman, both Labour. The listed value for the tickets for two to see the opera Ariadne on Naxos vary from £1,278 to £1,534. It means that, in just two months, JTI paid out £16,677 in hospitality. Health campaigners accused Mr Cameron of betrayal on Friday after he ditched pledges to crack down on cigarettes and alcohol. One charity dubbed it ‘a good day for undertakers’. Tobacco Giant: The company makes Silk Cut, Benson & Hedges, Camel and Old Holborn . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that plans to force tobacco firms to sell their products in plain packaging had been shelved indefinitely. The Prime Minister is facing fresh questions about the role of Mr Crosby, who works for the Conservative Party for only a few days a month leaving him free to devote the rest of his time to his lobbying firm. Downing Street insisted Mr Crosby ‘had no input into the decision on plain packaging’. But Mr Burstow told the Observer: ‘Lynton Crosby cannot remain at the heart of government while he is also serving the interests of the tobacco industry. If he does not go, the Prime Minister should sack him.’ Plans to introduce a minimum price for alcohol will also be dropped next week, again following a major lobbying campaign. Proposals to outlaw multi-buy drinks deals are also set to be shelved amid fears of a public backlash.But ministers will still bring forward plans to ban supermarkets from selling alcohol at below cost.","Nine Tory MPs accepted gifts from firm that makes Silk Cut, Camel and Benson and Hedges .

Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb said the country's attitude to pensioners is 'uncivilised' Neighbourhood watch groups should help ‘lonely and miserable’ pensioners, according to a health minister. Norman Lamb argues that more than a million pensioners could be cared for by the anti-crime groups. He also described the country’s attitude to the elderly as ‘uncivilised’ and urged the public to acknowledge that pensioners living nearby need their help. Mr Lamb wants to see the existing groups apply for ‘care status’ and play a role helping to wash and feed the elderly as well as providing companionship. The plans, which have the approval of senior Government figures and have been welcomed by neighbourhood watch leaders, would help to reduce the number of pensioners forced into care homes, the Liberal Democrat minister hopes. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said: ‘The truth is that many people in this day and age live miserable lives. ‘If someone lives on their own and has substantial care needs, and the extent of their life is getting out of bed, getting washed, sitting in a chair and going back to bed, with no one to see during the day, that is a miserable life. ‘We have a national movement that looks out for whether our houses are being burgled, so should we not be thinking – all of us stepping up to the plate – about whether there are people on our streets who have care needs, or who might just be very lonely and could do with a bit of companionship?’ Mr Lamb warned that care services were being put under increasing strain because of the growing elderly population. But he denied the plans meant the ‘state abdicating its responsibility’ and said the measures would be about ‘recognising there needs to be a collaboration’ between communities and authorities. He also fended off criticism that he was devaluing the role of skilled and trained carers, admitting that his plans could not be a replacement for traditional care. Jim Maddan, the chairman of the Neighbourhood Watch and Home Watch Network, said: ‘We would encourage this. It is important for groups of members to be aware of the vulnerable people in their communities.’ Mr Lamb fended off criticism that he was devaluing the role of skilled carers by saying Neighbourhood watch groups could care for the elderly . The move also won support from old age experts Saga with a note of caution over some of the more personal elements of care. Spokesman Paul Green said: ‘Anything that goes to show that Britain is a caring society and one which promotes good neighbourliness can only be a good thing and neighbourhood watch is a good place to start. ‘But when it comes to providing more intimate, personal care there is probably a greater element of screening and training that may be necessary.’ About 3.8million older people live alone, including 60 per cent of women aged 75 and over.

A senior judge has delivered the most damning verdict yet  on the Government’s plans to deliver ‘justice on the cheap’ by letting giant companies bid for legal aid contracts. Lord Justice Moses mockingly suggested that following controversial reforms to how law firms work, members of the judiciary should compete to produce the most judgments in the shortest time – and receive sponsorship from L’Oréal, Silk Cut or Virgin to help save the Treasury money. In an after-dinner speech to  the London Criminal Courts Solicitors’ Association last week, the Appeal Court judge, 67, described proposals by Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling as a ‘joke’ and chided David Cameron for not knowing what Magna Carta meant. He warned that plans to take legal aid cases away from hundreds of high street firms and hand them to companies such as haulier Eddie Stobart would create ‘a desert’ where choice would be meaningless. ‘What use is choice when you have nothing to choose save Eddie Stobarts? What is the point of asking a man to choose still or sparkling water when you have left him to crawl in the desert?’ he said. ‘If lawyers are not to provide services of a quality above a level specified by the state, why should judges?’ Lord Justice Moses joked it was ‘financially wasteful’ to have lots of independent judges so they should ‘amalgamate’ and gain sponsors to cut costs. The comments are the most withering attack so far on legal aid reforms by a serving member of the judiciary. Solicitors and barristers have led the charge against Mr Grayling’s Price Competitive Tendering plans, which would put dozens of small firms out of business by carving up legal aid contracts for criminal cases among a handful of corporations.","Lord Justice Moses slammed plan to let companies bid for legal aid contracts .

A street cleaning firm believes it could find £1million of precious metals among rubbish from Britain's streets. Veolia Environmental Services is to sift through its street sweepings in search of fragments of gold and silver, which can rub off jewellery, shoes and clothing. The company will also look for traces of palladium, platinum and rhodium, which are used in a car's catalytic converter and can fall out of exhaust pipes. Veolia is to sift through Britain's rubbish in search of precious metals . Veolia, which sweeps up 165,000 tons of rubbish from the street every year, has now set up Britain's first plant to mine for metal, reports the Sunday Telegraph. Richard Kirkman, the firm's technical director, told the newspaper: 'In the past we have always sent our street sweeping to landfill or compost sites. 'We . wanted to find something to do with this material, so we are separating . everything out with flotation tanks and mechanical sorting machines. 'We . are left with this fine black dust and we have found palladium, rhodium . and platinum at levels they are found in the ore when it is mined from . the ground.' Up to 1.5 tons of platinum, 1.3 tons of palladium and 0.8 tons of rhodium could be found every year in the 40 towns and cities where Veolia holds cleaning contracts, it is believed. Platinum and palladium are prized for jewellery, with platinum also being used in electronic equipment and palladium in fuel cells. The practice of panning for gold began in Mumbai in India in sewage pipes outside goldsmith's houses. In 2011, Raffi Stepanian claimed he can make $800 (£530) a week from precious metals found on the streets in New York's diamond district. Raffi Stepanian, 43, uses tweezers to pick up fragments of precious metals off the streets in New York's diamond district . Mr Stepanian began hunting for treasure when he was working as a stone setter and found gold scraps on the floor of a diamond exchange . Many of the fragments are carried out into the street by gold and gem merchants, who accidentally pick it up on their clothes. Mr Stepanian also finds tiny chips of platinum, gold earring backs and loops from broken necklaces, watches and chains, all of which have been dropped by mistake. His daily treasure hunt started several years ago, when he was working as a stone setter and found gold scraps on the floor of a diamond exchange. He realised if he could find gold inside, it must be outside too - so he started scouring the sidewalks. Mr Stepanian told the New York Post: 'The stones are already cut and manufactured - it's a step above a mine. I'm finding them already cut and polished.'","Veolia believes it could find £1million of valuable metals on streets every year .

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 06:54 EST, 15 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:15 EST, 15 July 2013 . A new language has been discovered in a small outback Australian town. The language, now known as Light Warlpir, is used in Lajamanu, a tiny desert community located half-way between Darwin and Alice Springs, on the edge of the Tanami Desert. The isolated village has a population of about 700 and is populated mostly by the descendants of Aborigines forcibly resettled by the Australian government. Discovery: The language, now known as Light Warlpir, is used in Lajamanu, a tiny desert community located half-way between Darwin and Alice Springs, on the edge of the Tanami Desert . All residents speak traditional 'strong' Warlpiri and some speak Kriol, an English-based creole developed in the late 19th century, reported Australia's Daily Telegraph. Only about 350 young locals speak the Light Warlpir - and none of them are over 35. Carmel O'Shannessy, a professor in the department of linguistics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor documented the discovery of Light Warlpiri in a study published online in the journal Language reported LiveScience. O'Shannessy first discovered the . language when she began working in a school in the Northern Territory . where traditional Warlpiri was being taught to children. She noticed that some of the students appeared to switch between several languages in conversation. 'After a while, I realised this switching took place in every sentence, and I decided to investigate it,"" O'Shannessy said. 'Once . I recorded children speaking, I looked at the patterns and I could see . that there were very striking systematic patterns. It was then that I . realised this was a system of its own,' she told the website. Select: Only about 350 young locals speak the Light Warlpir - and none of them are over 35 . 'The striking thing about Light Warlpiri . is that most of the verbs come from English or Kriol, but most of the . other grammatical elements in the sentence come from Warlpiri,' O'Shannessy told the website. In the Warlpiri language words can be placed in any order, and grammatical interpretations are based on suffixes that are attached to the nouns. Another interesting facet is a word form that refers to both the present and past time, but not the future. According to O'Shannessy it is likely Light Warlpiri emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. She believes it was when children went from switching between English, Kriol and Warlpiri to speaking the mixed Light Warlpiri language on a primary basis. The news, which has excited linguists across the world is not the first time the tiny town has hit the headlines. In 2010, residents were left speechless after fish began falling from the sky. Hundreds . of spangled perch bombarded residents of Lajamanu, shocking . local Christine Balmer, who was walking home when the strange 'weather' started. She said: 'These fish fell in their hundreds and hundreds . all over the place. The locals were running around everywhere picking . them up. Meterologists say the incident was probably caused by a tornado. It is common for tornados to suck up water and fish from rivers and drop them hundreds of miles away.","The newly-discovered language is now known as Light Warlpir .

They unveiled a new flagship store in London in February and then last month opened their first store in Asia. Now the British brand have announced they will join London Fashion Week for the first time by hosting an event on Sunday, 15 September. A Smythson spokesperson told Vogue that 'the outing will celebrate the brand's key bag of the season - the Panama - a tote designed in both red and blue'. VIP support: Samantha Cameron attended the Smythson store opening ceremony last month in Hong Kong . Expanding: The Hong Kong store is the brand's first standalone shop in Asia . Credit for the brand's expansion can partly be attributed to the effect of Samantha Cameron, their former creative director who has since become a global ambassador for the brand in her role as Britain's 'first lady'. The 40-year-old stepped down from her job in 2010 when her husband became Prime Minister and she was pregnant with daughter, Florence. Bag of the season: Their London Fashion Week event will celebrate the Panama tote . But she has remained involved with the company as a creative consultant and last month cut the ribbon to officially open their stand-alone store in Hong Kong. While she was there, she told the South China Morning Post she's delighted at how the brand has evolved over the years. She said: 'I joined (Smythson) around 1996. I've . always been a fan of the brand so it was great to go in and 'have a . fiddle'. I think it's been great but it's been an . evolution rather than a revolution.' Symthson was founded by Frank Symthson in 1887 specialising in luxury leather stationary, diaries and bags. Mrs Cameron said the company have worked hard to stay true to Mr Symthson's vision while also moving the collections forward with modern touches. She said: 'When I arrived, we honed the aesthetic. We did a lot with colour and certainly expanded the women's products, relaunching handbags, as they'd always been a strong part of [founder] Frank Smythson's original collection. I went very much back into the archives.' She added that under the guidance of chief executive Andy Janowski, 'everything we've done is think about what's relevant today, both in the aesthetics and practicality, and what's going to be relevant tomorrow.' As well as travelling to Hong Kong for the recent store opening, Mrs Cameron was also involved in the unveiling of the new London store in Sloane Street in February as she hosted a tea party as part of their official celebrations. Bags of style: The wife of the PM carried a Smythson bag as she attended their new London store opening in February . So it's likely she will also make a personal appearance at their London Fashion Week outing. Mrs Cameron is keen to play down her own part in the brand's resurgence pointing instead to it being due to the 'cool Britannia' vibe spreading globally thanks to the royal wedding, Queen's jubilee and London Olympics. She said: 'Its been fantastic that Britain has been (experiencing this). Whether it's the royal wedding, or the Olympics, or our fantastic fashion designers, its great to be part of that.'","British brand will host event in September .

Anyone who saw Jessica Biel at the Cannes Film Festival can be in little doubt of her natural stunning beauty, but now her make-up artist Lisa Eldridge has bowed to demand and revealed exactly how she achieved that dewy look. Lisa was inundated with requests of how to re-create the look, with many brides-to-be wanting to recreate it for their big day. Lisa says: ‘It is one of those looks that’s perfect for that type of thing as it works on so many different types of skin tones and different ages.’ Lisa Eldridge originally created the look for Jessica Biel for the Cannes Film Festival . The finished look Lisa shows her fans how to create is perfect for a blushing bride . The fresh natural look will give you a rosy glow and is suitable for many skin types and ages . She suggests starting your skin make up with ‘Make up forever HD’ which is ideal for occasions where you anticipate being photographed a lot such as your wedding day. Using both a foundation and a Kabuki brash she applies the fine textured foundation carefully, covering a larger area than normal. ‘As this is special occasion make-up I’m going to take it down a little onto the neck, and maybe the chest if you’re wearing a dress that is low at the front. ‘This just makes sure all the skin is even.’ The next step on your road to a perfect wedding glow is Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector. Lisa suggests applying several, very thin layers to the cheekbone with a foundation brush before gently patting the edges to blend it in. A Channel crème blush is applied to the apples of the cheeks and blended out ward with fingers to achieve a rosy glow. Lisa preps the eye area by using Nars Pro Prime Smudge Proof eye shadow base all around the eye area, before using a Dior eye shadow palette in rosy, plummy shades. For a special occasion look Lisa suggests bring the foundation down round the neck and even chest area to ensure skin is smooth . A ‘shimmery, sable mink’ colour is aopplied lightly all over the lids, then a plumy shade is blended softly into the outer corner of the lid to define and give the eye. Lisa then uses a mixer of the two shade to line the lower lid before adding a little more of the darker shade to further define the outer corner. A sweep of the rose colour is added, before a light wash of the highlighter on the brown bone to create a subtle look. Lisa applies concealer after eye shadow to avoid any smudges caused by the eye shadow dropping onto the under eye area. Pink, plum and nude eye shadows create a natural fresh look . It also allows time for the foundation to sink in and the areas that need concealer to become more apparent. A light layer of powder gives a velvety look which works well for the infamous wedding photos. Black mauve waterproof eyeliner is worked into the base of the lashes, thickening out slightly towards the outer corners of the eye. Lisa then curls the lashes before applying Giorgio Armani ‘eyes to kill’ waterproof mascara, which will stay put all day, before lashes are thickened by adding individual lashes gently to the upper lid. Individual fake lashes are applied with tweezers to thicken the lashes as well as mascara and eyeliner . In order to ensure your lips are smooth, Lisa rubs a cotton bub over the lips before applying Bobbi brown lip liner as a stain across the whole lips. The finishing touch is Tom Ford pink-nude lip colour, and a light touch of powder blusher with a touch of shimmer in. Lisa admits that Jessica Beil added to the look further by adding a touch of silver eye shadow on top of Lisa’s palette of pinks and plums to complement the stunning silver dress she wore to the Cannes Film Festival.

Beyoncé called in a concert for a moment of silence for Trayvon Martin, rapper Young Jeezy released a song in Martin's memory and Russell Simmons called for peace after George Zimmerman was acquitted by a Florida jury in the death of the teenager. There was a wide range of reactions from celebrities after jurors cleared Zimmerman late Saturday of all charges in the 2012 shooting death of the unarmed 17-year-old Martin. Beyonce took a moment to honor Martin during her Mrs Carter Show World Tour concert at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee. Reaction: Beyoncé, pictured on stage in Tennessee on Saturday evening, called for a moment of silence for Trayvon Martin after George Zimmerman was found not guilty of the teenager's shooting death . Her concert started about 30 minutes after the Zimmerman verdict began to circulate. 'I'd like to have a moment of silence for Trayvon,' the pop star said as the stage grew dark with just a few key lights shining. Beyonce then sang the chorus of I Will Always Love You, a song, fittingly given the location, written by country music star Dolly Parton and brought to a global audience by the late Whitney Houston, before transitioning into her hit Halo. It was just one of several reactions from celebrities and artists following Zimmerman's acquittal by a six-woman jury. Much of it focused on the perceived outrage of the situation. But others had more poignant responses. Moment of silence: Beyoncé and other celebrities paid tribute to teenager Trayvon Martin who was shot dead by a neighborhood watch man George Zimmerman .

These are my true feelings and my form of expression about it.' Simmons, a producer and entrepreneur, posted a blog entry that said he'd be supporting the Trayvon Martin Foundation in helping to repeal laws like Florida's Stand Your Ground law. He signed off, 'God bless you little brother. Rest in peace.' He also called for those upset with the verdict to channel their energy away from violence on Twitter, telling followers 'we must remain peaceful. No matter what, remain peaceful'. 'If u have any anger this evening,' Simmons wrote on Twitter, 'put that energy into challenging these horrible laws that allow overly-anxious neighborhood watchmen to carry guns and shoot innocent people.' Figures from music, film and sport repeated the sentiment while angry and saddened by the court ruling.

Add retailers to the list of groups tracking the movements and habits of unsuspecting people.In an effort to gain the competitive advantage websites have had for years, stores have begun tracking shoppers movements and moods through their cell phones and with special cameras that can recognize facial expressions – without shoppers' consent. Recent reports of this activity have raised privacy concerns despite repeated assurances from merchants that no personal information is collected from devices.Some the stores using the tracking technology are Benetton, Cabelas, Family Dollar, Mothercare and Warby Parker according to reports. Nordstrom used the technology last autumn in a pilot, but discontinued the program after public outcry. Tracking you: Nordstrom was tracking shopper movements through the WiFi signals in their cell phones until ending the program earlier this year . Nordstrom stores posted signs telling customers about the tracking program, but shoppers interviewed by a Denver TV station were unaware of it since the signs were placed in hard to notice locations, near an entrance at floor level in one instance.One shopper told the station it was ‘scary’ and another called it an invasion of her privacy. Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack were able to track shopper behaviors via a smartphone’s wifi signal, which allowed the retailer to analyse how long a shopper spent in a particular area and to track shopper movements, as well as how many people that walked past the store decided to walk in, according to a report by the New York Times. Nordstrom stopped the pilot in May after customer complaints became too numerous, according to reports. John Fu a spokesperson for Euclid, the firm who supplied the technology, told the station that his firm doesn't identify shoppers and declined to name other stores using the tracking tech . 'We never know the name or identity of a particular consumer, so you know, we don't identify the names of our clients either,' Fu added. Not just in the store: Shoppers not even entering stores can be tracked with the technology . Stores want this information because they are at a disadvantage to online retailers like Amazon that are able to track shopper movements around the sites through the use of cookies, allowing the online competitors to recommend additional products and show what other people who bought one thing also bought. Notice: This sign notifying shoppers they were being tracked was found by a Denver TV station - practically on the floor . ‘Brick-and-mortar stores have been disadvantaged compared with online retailers, which get people’s digital crumbs,’ Guido Jouret, head of technology firm Cisco’s emerging technologies group, told the Times.Cisco is one of a number of vendors that provide cameras to stores looking to track how long people spend in a given department, which can tell them how to best organize stores or streamline individual aisles. RetailNext, according to the Times, combines the power of video with the trail of cookie crumbs left behind by cell phones. Their technology is able to not only track shopper movements, but also identify repeat customers – without a phone even connecting to store’s WiFi network. This is because phones looking for WiFi networks still send a unique identifier even if they don’t connect to a specific network.Stores are also using cameras to analyze facial expressions and moods.Synqera, based in Russia, uses facial recognition at store checkouts to tailor marketing based on gender, age and mood, according to the Times.‘If you are an angry man of 30, and it is Friday evening, it may offer you a bottle of whiskey,’ Ekaterina Savchenko told the paper.Other companies allow people to opt-in and provide some basic personal information that pinpoints them in a store department and can send them coupons aimed at encouraging a purchase, something at least one shopper who spoke to the Times liked.‘I would just love it if a coupon pops up on my phone,’ Linda Vertlieb said. Mail Online was unable to reach any of the stores or technology vendors named in this article for further comment.","Retailers across the globe are tracking shoppers without their consent .

'Fabulous Fab': Prosecutors say the the trial of former Goldman Sachs bond trader Fabrice Tourre, pictured, was about 'Wall Street greed' The former Goldman Sachs bond trader known as ‘Fabulous Fab’ who allegedly sold $1 billion in toxic mortgage investments deliberately designed to fail in the U.S. housing market crash epitomized 'Wall Street greed', the court heard today. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Fabrice Tourre, a party lover who claimed to be from a prominent French family, of misleading investors in a mortgage . investment called Abacus 2007-AC1 by not telling them that a hedge fund . was involved in selecting the underlying assets and betting against it. SEC lawyer Matthew . Martens told the jury in the trial, which kicked off today in New York, the deal Tourre put . together was 'secretly designed to maximize the potential it would fail' to the benefit of the hedge fund, which made about $1 billion. 'In the end, Wall Street greed drove Mr. Tourre to lie and deceive,' Martens said. But Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, countered that the SEC was trying to turn her client into a 'scapegoat'. 'This is not a case about whether you approve or disapprove of Wall Street,' she said. The trial, scheduled to last three weeks, stems from a lawsuit the SEC filed against Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Tourre in 2010. Tourre, who is no longer with Goldman and is earning a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago, is on trial alone after Goldman agreed to pay a $550 million settlement in July 2010. Under fire: Former Goldman Sachs executive Fabrice Tourre, pictured, trying to dodge the media scrum as he enters Manhattan federal court on the first day of his trial in New York . Tourre, wearing a black suit and orange tie, sat with his counsel as the lawyers made their opening arguments. He did not speak during Monday's proceedings, although he is expected to testify later in the trial. The SEC contends Tourre, at the time a vice president at Goldman, failed to disclose that Paulson & Co Inc, the hedge fund run by billionaire John Paulson, was involved in picking mortgage securities tied to the Abacus investment and that it was also shorting, or betting against, it. Martens said Tourre, the principal Goldman employee involved in the Abacus deal, had a duty to be truthful with investors. Instead, he hid 'critical information' in order to get them to buy in. Tourre also misled ACA Capital Holdings Inc, a third-party firm ostensibly brought in to select the securities included in the CDO, into believing that Paulson was an equity investor in Abacus rather than taking a short position, Martens said. The SEC contends ACA would not have participated had it known Paulson was betting against the investment. A different firm decided not to participate as ACA's portfolio selection agent when Tourre told it Paulson was going short, Martens said. 'His solution was trickery and half-truths,' he said. 'His solution was securities fraud.' 'Innocent': Lawyers for Fabrice Tourre, left, say the former Goldman Sachs trader did not mislead investors . Martens also displayed a much-cited email sent on January 23, 2007, by Tourre to his girlfriend at the time, saying of the financial markets that the 'whole building is about to collapse anytime now'. 'Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab ... standing in the middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities!!!' the email said. Investors lost more than $1 billion after almost all the securities tied to the transaction were downgraded, the SEC says. Paulson earned about the same amount thanks to his bet, the SEC says. Goldman made $15 million in fees on the deal, Martens said. Chepiga, Tourre's lawyer, countered in her own opening arguments that her client had not misled investors or ACA. She said ACA knew at the time that Paulson was widely reported to be engaged in an aggressive bet against the U.S. housing market after setting up two funds to short subprime investments in 2006. 'ACA knew Paulson took the opposite view,' she said. Bourgeoisie: Fabrice Tourre reportedly 'loved to party' and claimed to be from a prominent French family . ACA, not Paulson, picked the securities tied to Abacus, she said, adding that ACA rejected dozens of securities that Paulson wanted included and ran a sophisticated computer analysis before signing off on them. It was standard for a firm such as ACA to take input from investors in selecting securities for a CDO, Chepiga said. In the case of a deal such as Abacus, known as a synthetic collateralized debt obligation, it would be usual to consult both long and short investors, which by design have both long and short investors involved. 'The decision here was made by ACA,' she said. 'The selection here was made by ACA.' As for Tourre's email to his girlfriend, Chepiga said it was irrelevant, calling it 'an old fashioned love letter' and noting it was referencing a Financial Times article, which he attached. 'I know two to three weeks from now you will find he did nothing wrong,' Chepiga said. The jury was also selected today, with the court picking five women and four men as jurors out of a pool of 48 people. They include a retired special education teacher, a former retail broker now teaching art history, a recent medical school graduate and an Episcopal priest. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest excused some potential jurors after they said they had views about Wall Street or the role of banks in the financial crisis. The first juror to be excused said he had 'a fairly jaundiced view of Wall Street.' Forrest also quizzed jurors on whether they had ever heard of Abacus, Tourre or his nickname, 'Fabulous Fab'. At the start of the trial, Forrest warned the lawyers on both sides to 'have a heart' and be mindful many jurors would not know the financial jargon expected to be used at trial. Among the words or phrases she singled out were 'asset-backed', 'short', 'security', 'flip book' and 'swap'. She also cited the term 'trading desk', saying 'mere mortals don't know what a trading desk is.' 'Do not assume people know what investment bankers do,' Forrest added.","Former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre's trial started today .

Dr. Anthony Garcia, who now lives in Terre Haute, Ind., was arrested by Illinois State Police during a traffic stop Monday in Union County, which is in the south of the state near Illinois' borders with Indiana and Missouri, Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said. Officers said he appeared to be intoxicated when they arrested him that he had a .45-caliber handgun with him. Garcia, 40, was being held in Illinois on suspicion of four counts of first-degree murder and four counts of using a weapon to commit a felony, Schmaderer said. Garcia didn't have a listed phone . number in Terre Haute or in Chicago, where he previously lived, and it . wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney. No one answered the . phone at his family's home in Walnut, Calif., Monday evening. Public . records show that since 2003, Garcia has held medical licenses in . California, Illinois and Indiana, but his temporary Indiana license . expired in January. Investigators . believe that in May, Garcia broke into the Omaha home of Creighton . University medical school pathology professor Roger Brumback and fatally . shot him and stabbed his wife Mary to death, Schmaderer said. They also . believe Garcia was behind a 2008 home invasion in which the 11-year-old . son and family housekeeper of another pathology department professor, . William Hunter, were stabbed to death. Investigators believe that in May, Garcia broke into the Omaha home of Creighton University medical school pathology professor Roger Brumback (left) and fatally shot him and stabbed his wife Mary (right) to death . Garcia is also accused of stabbing to death Thomas Hunter (left) and Shirlee Sherman (right) in 2008. Hunter is the 11-year-old son of Creighton professor William Hunter and Sherman was the Hunter family's housekeeper . In . 2001, Roger Brumback and Hunter fired Garcia, who was a department . resident, because he had displayed erratic behavior, Schmaderer said. The police chief didn't provide further details of the alleged behavior . and he declined to discuss the evidence used to build the case against . Garcia. A task force of local, state and FBI investigators has been working on the case, and its members believe Garcia fits all the criteria of a serial killer, Schmaderer said. 'We didn't feel this individual would stop unless an arrest was made,' he said. Schmaderer said investigators believe Garcia acted alone, and that they are also searching several places where Garcia has lived since 2001. The Omaha attacks happened in neighborhoods where homicides are rare. The city averages about 40 per year. One of the Brumbacks' three children, Darryl, said the family had no comment about the arrest. A male relative of Sherman's also declined to speak. The Hunter family didn't respond to a phone message seeking comment. In 2001, Roger Brumback and Hunter fired Garcia, pictured on July 15, 2013 (left) and in 2006 (right), who was a department resident, because he had displayed erratic behavior . Hunter's son, Thomas Hunter, and housekeeper, Shirlee Sherman, were killed at the family's 3,700-square-foot home in the historic neighborhood of Dundee, which is home to some of the city's most prominent residents, including billionaire investor Warren Buffet. The case was featured last year on an episode of 'America's Most Wanted,' and a $54,000 reward was offered. Schmaderer said Monday that investigators don't believe the boy and the housekeeper were the intended targets of the attack. Authorities have released few details about the attack on the Brumbacks, other than manner in which they were killed. Their bodies were discovered in their west Omaha home on May 14. The task force was set up after the Brumbacks' deaths to investigate whether they were tied to the unsolved 2008 killings. Schmaderer declined to say what led investigators to Garcia.","Dr. Anthony Garcia, 40, was arrested Monday during a traffic stop .

A teenager destined to spend life behind bars for stabbing to death her newborn 135 times after secretly giving birth in the laundry room of her Minnesota home is back on a trial for a second time. Nicole Beecroft was just 17 when she was sentenced to life in prison for killing her baby girl - who she kept secret from her family - and throwing the towel-covered body in a trash can at the front of her Oakdale home in April 2007. But last year the now 24-year-old's conviction and life sentence was overturned. Her new trial began yesterday with explosive questions around whether the infant was already dead when she was knifed. Disturbing: Nicole Beecroft was 17 when she was sentenced to life in prison for killing her baby girl and throwing her body in a trash can at the front of her Oakdale home in 2007 . Second chance: Nicole Beecroft, now 24, is on trial for a second time over the alleged stabbing death of her newborn in 2007 . Defense attorney Christine Funk told a Washington County judge the crucial issue in the second murder trial was whether the baby was born stillborn, as Beecroft has always maintained. 'The state wants you to . focus on why Nicole would stab the baby if she were already dead,' Funk said, according to Twin Cities. 'The issue is whether the state can . prove beyond a reasonable doubt whether the defendant's actions caused . the death of that infant.' However prosecutors argue the baby was alive and never intended to keep the baby, going to great lengths to conceal the pregnancy. 'On her way downstairs, she . grabbed a steak knife and two scissors,' Washington County prosecutor Siv . Yurichuk said. 'She stabbed that baby 135 times. Over and over and over, until the baby was so fraught with wounds she . bled to death.' Beecroft reportedly told her best friend about the killing, whose family then tipped off police. Last year, Beecroft's life sentence without parole for first-degree premeditated murder was quashed by the Minnesota . Supreme Court. The court found Beecroft's rights of due process were violated because interfering prosecutors prevented the . defense from calling expert witnesses. Just a child: Nicole Beecroft was a senior at Tartan High School, pictured, when she allegedly stabbed her newborn to death . Yurichuk said the medical examiner who performed the autopsy determined the full-term baby was born alive and died from her wounds. 'Why would somebody stab a baby that's already dead?' she said. During the testimony of an Oakdale police officer, a recording was played of Beecroft's first police interview on April 10, 2007, before the infant's body had been found. Beecroft told the interviewing officers she 'went into panic mode' when the baby wasn't breathing, and lay with the baby for some time waiting for her to cry. She never mentioned the stabbing. 'What were you going to do if the baby was breathing?' one interviewer asked her. 'Bring her to the hospital,' Beecroft, who had never been in trouble with the law and worked two jobs, said. Horrific: Beecroft was sentenced to life in prison in 2008 for stabbing her newborn daughter to death with scissors and a steak knife . She said her mother Kari Beecroft, now deceased, and her mother's boyfriend were home at the time,  but she didn't tell them what was going on, according to Twin Cities. 'How can you throw your child in the trash? Whether your mom approves or not ... this baby had a chance at living,' an interviewing officers asked. Prosecutors said they will finish presenting their case next week.","Nicole Beecroft is on trial for a second time over the alleged stabbing death of her newborn in 2007 .

A woman who lied about her role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide was sentenced on Monday to ten years in prison, a fate her lawyers say is tantamount to a death sentence. Rwanda native Beatrice Munyenyezi, from New Hampshire, remained stoic as U.S. District Judge Steven McAuliffe sentenced her to the maximum prison time. She declined her right to address the court. Munyenyezi, 43, was convicted in February of entering the United States and securing citizenship by lying about her role as a commander of one of the notorious roadblocks in the city of Butare - where Tutsis were singled out for slaughter as they tried to evacuate. Facing her crimes: Rwanda native Beatrice Munyenyezi, from New Hampshire, remained stoic as U.S. District Judge Steven McAuliffe sentenced her to the maximum prison time for her role in the Rwandan genocide . According to some reports, a fifth of the 500,000 massacred during the Rwandan genocide were killed in Butare. However due to the chaotic nature of the genocide, it has been difficult for experts to put exact numbers on how many died. She also denied affiliation with any political party, despite her husband's leadership role in the extremist Hutu militia party. McAuliffe acknowledged she has led a crime-free and productive life since her arrival in New Hampshire in 1998 but said it was a life lived under false pretenses. There was no visible reaction from Munyenyezi or her three teenage daughters when the sentence was imposed. But midway through the sentencing, Munyenyezi started weeping. 'It's very, very traumatic,' defense attorney David Ruoff said afterward. 'She's been anxious about this, regardless of what happened in Rwanda in 1994. 'It's traumatic for any person to face their kids under these circumstances.' Federal prosecutors had sought the maximum prison sentence, saying she's as guilty as if she wielded the machete herself. Horror: Rwandans view bodies during the country's horrific genocide in 1994 . At least 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in a campaign of mass murder orchestrated by Hutu extremists during the 1994 genocide. Munyenyezi's lawyers say they will appeal her conviction to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals - a move that is expected to delay deportation proceedings. Ruoff said he too had considered asking for the maximum 10-year term, to keep Munyenyezi in the United States longer. 'She stays here, she has access to her children,' he said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said the case would be a challenge, and that no similar case linked to the Rwanda genocide had ever been prosecuted in the United States. Through two trials and the three years since her indictment in 2010, Munyenyezi has remained silent. She did not testify and declined an Associated Press request for an interview in the wake of her first trial ending a mistrial in 2012. She has spent most of those three years in custody and apart from her three daughters, ages 18-20. Her lawyers portrayed her as the victim of lies by Rwandan witnesses who never before implicated her through nearly two decades of investigations and trials — even when testifying against her husband and his mother before the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda. Prosecutors maintained that she was a liar who 'gamed' the immigration system to fraudulently obtain the 'golden ticket' of citizenship. Brutality and murder: Rwandese refugees cross Rusumo border to Tanzania from Rwanda carrying their belongings. It has been estimated that about half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered during the 1994 genocide . She swore on immigration and naturalization forms that she persecuted no one, had no affiliation with any political party and even cast herself as a victim of the genocide by saying family members 'disappeared'. Munyenyezi fled to Nairobi, Kenya with her young daughter in July 1994, in the waning days of the genocide. Her twins were born there four months later. She entered the United States as a refugee and settled in Manchester with the aid of refugee relief agencies. Before long, she had a $13-an-hour job working for the city's housing authority. Her children were enrolled in Catholic school and she attended college and earned an associate's degree. She financed a comfortable lifestyle through mortgages, loans and credit cards - only to file for bankruptcy in 2008 and have about $400,000 in debt discharged. Munyenyezi's husband, Arsene Shalom Ntahobali and his mother were convicted of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes of violence and are serving life sentences. Both were deemed to be high-ranking members of the Hutu militia party that orchestrated the savage attacks on Tutsis.","Beatrice Munyenyezi, who has lived in New Hampshire since 1998, lied about her role as a commander in militia which slaughtered at least half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus during 1994 Rwandan genocide ."

An aide to congresswoman Michele Bachmann was caught on hidden camera stealing from her chief of staff. Javier Sanchez, 37, of Virginia, was arrested Thursday and charged with theft after a sting set up by U.S. Capitol Police caught him stealing envelopes of cash out of her chief of staff's desk. Formerly a senior legislative assistant to Bachmann (R-MN), Sanchez is no longer a member of her staff, according to reports. Strange: Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., with staff member Javier Sanchez, who has been charged with thefts in a House office building . Sanchez was caught on hidden camera by U.S. Capitol Police stealing two separate envelopes from a desk in her chief of staff's office. One envelope was marked '$80 petty cash' and the other '$120 birthday money,' according to NBC Washington. The thefts took place in the Rayburn office building. The former aide was arrested July 11 after investigators set up the sting in response to a string of thefts in the building, Fox News reported. A prominent member of the tea party movement, Bachmann recently announced she will not seek re-election to the House. The outgoing congresswoman also ran an unsuccessful, but divisive and eventful, bid for the Republican nomination during the 2012 presidential election. In a May YouTube video announcing her leave from Congress Bachmann compared her exit to that of a two term president, saying 'the law limits anyone from serving as president of the United States for more than eight years, and in my opinion, well, eight years is also long enough for an individual to serve as a representative for a specific Congressional district.' Sanchez was charged with second degree misdemeanor theft and released on his own personal recognizance. He is due in court August 26 for a hearing, according to officials. Still being investigated, a series of thefts in the building last year have not yet been linked to Sanchez, NBC Washington reported.","Javier Sanchez is accused of stealing from Michele Bachmann's staff .

The cousin of a four-year-old girl who was kidnapped and murdered 16 years ago has launched a Facebook page in the hope of finally solving the grisly crime. Angie Spade, 35, believes that reminding people on social media about Jessica Phelps and her 1997 death could jog the memory of someone who may know anything about the killing. 'It only takes one small, or seemingly small, detail to blow this cold case wide open,' Spade told Mlive. 'I don't want people to forget her.' The four-year-old girl vanished from her home in Flint, Michigan on July 1, 1997 as she played outside while her mother was in the shower. Mystery: Jessica Phelps, 4, was kidnapped and murdered in 1997 - and her killer has never been found . When her mother realized the little girl was gone, she frantically searched the neighborhood with friends and residents before alerting the police. Friends handed out hundreds of flyers, restaurant employees wore . t-shirts printed with her image and delivery vehicles pasted her . photograph in their windows - but there was no sign of her. Nine months later, on April 2, 1998, her . skeletal remains were found by a highways worker cleaning out a ditch . in Atlas Township. Clothes resembling what she had been wearing were . found nearby. But her body was so badly decomposed and exposed to the elements that DNA evidence was unable to pinpoint her killer. No one has ever been charged with her death. Innocence: Her cousin, Angie Spade (both pictured), set up a Facebook page to reinvigorate the search . Ripped apart: Angie, left, said she doesn't want people to forget her cousin, right, who would be 20 today . Her face appeared on Crime Stoppers and America's Most Wanted, and sparked tips from as far away as Hawaii. Former Flint police Sgt. Gary Elford, . who has since retired, previously told Mlive that . authorities received a tip that she was possibly taken by a man in . Tawas. An investigator looked into the tip, and found a girl that looked just like . Jessica - but she was missing the young girl's gap between her teeth. As the years passed, tips became less frequent and other homicide cases meant that Flint investigators were unable to devote time to Jessica's case. Adorable: The little girl was snatched from outside her home and her remains were found nine months later . Missed: Police have received tips from all over the country but 16 years on, her killer has still not been found . In November 2012, Spade launched the Facebook page, Justice for Jessica, and it has received more than 2,000 likes. She . is hoping that the Facebook page will remind people of the case and be . able to gather any information people have about the case. Sgt. Greg Hosmer with the Flint police said the investigation is still open . and that tips continue to trickle in - even as recently as the end of . last year. Authorities still . have not determined how Jessica died due to the decomposition of her . body, but Hosmer said he believes she was asphyxiated. Hope: Angie hopes the Facebook page will encourage people to come forward with information . Solving these types of cases relies heavily upon people coming forward, he said. 'Relationships change,' he told Mlive. 'Someone could come forward and spill their guts.' Anyone with information on Jessica's disappearance or death is asked to contact Flint police at 810-237-6800.
