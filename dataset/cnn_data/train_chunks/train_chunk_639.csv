Charlie Green, now 18, has been sentenced to three years in a young offenders institution after stealing the ashes of a magistrate from his widow's home . A 'teenager from hell' has been detained for three years after stealing the ashes of a magistrate from his heartbroken widow's home. Charlie Green, now 18, and an 17-year-old accomplice, who can't be named for legal reasons, targeted the widow's home during a burglary spree which saw them break-in to three homes in one night. His victim Kathryn Gibson, 52, returned home to find an urn containing the remains of her late husband . Robert had been snatched during a burglary at their home. When police caught up with the 17-year old culprits both blamed their drink and drug crazed behaviour on being from broken homes with one claiming he had a 'communication disorder'. It emerged the pair invaded three homes in just one night as people slept, driving off in two cars and crashing one. Police recovered Mr Gibson’s ashes after the urn was found dumped on waste land 24 hours after the burglary spree. The gang’s ringleader Green - otherwise known as Charlie Chipps - had already been dubbed a 'teenager from hell' near his home in Burnley, Lancashire, and had started smoking cannabis when he was 11. He had already been given two anti-social behaviour orders after threatening residents - yet had ignored all the prohibitions. He has a string of convictions including violence, drugs, burglary and racially aggravated assault. At Burnley Crown Court, Green, now 18, and a 17-year old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were sent to a Young Offender Institution for three years after they admitted aggravated burglary, burglary and theft. An accomplice Joel Ludlum, 18, was locked away for 40 months after he admitted joining the pair on other burglaries. After the case Mrs Gibson, a retired . NHS administrator whose 66-year old late husband, an ambulance . technician, served as a JP in Blackburn and Accrington said: 'These . teenagers are scum and I don’t think locking them up will deter them. Prison is too much of a luxury these days - so much so they are not . being punished anymore. Heartbroken: Kathryn Gibson and her daughter Natalie pictured with her late husband's ashes after the were found dumped on wasteland . 'I’m sure they will be given a TV and a games console - and the taxpayer will be paying for that too. 'These lads have been in and out of trouble since god knows when and they obviously don’t care about anyone else except themselves. 'I personally blame the parents because these boys have got away with it from such a young age. I would love to know what their families think. 'If this case came up before my husband he would have been absolutely disgusted with these young lads. It is bad enough breaking into someone’s house but to take something like someone’s ashes should be unthinkable - even to a burglar. 'I don’t think they have any kind of conscience about what they have done. We know they don’t because after they burgled us they went on to burgle other people. 'If they were bothered they would have thought “what are we doing”. It is just like a job to them, they are not bothered about the distress and heartache their behaviour has caused to us and other people.' Kathryn Gibson, pictured left with her husband Richard's urn and right on their wedding day 32 years ago, blamed the parents of the teenagers for their behaviour . Father-of-two Mr Gibson, who was married . to Kathryn for 32 years, had been a volunteer with St John Ambulance . and after retiring became a driver for the elderly with the Dial-a-Ride. He died of a heart attack in December last year, just days after he agreed to play Father Christmas at a local special school. He was cremated and his ashes were due to be scattered in his favourite part of the Scottish highlands. The break-in occurred on April 20 when Green and his younger accomplice had a cocktail of alcohol and drugs. Both snatched the ashes after kicking in the back door of Mrs Gibson’s home while she was dropping off her daughter in Accrington. Mrs Gibson added: 'When I came home the burglar alarm was making a different sound and when I walked through to the kitchen I saw the bottom panel of the back door had been kicked through with some force and they had kicked through the steel plate. Accomplice: Joel Ludlam, who was not involved in the ashes theft but joined Green on other burglaries, was jailed for 40 months . 'The laptops were there and the Wii and . the DVDs and then I noticed the urn had gone which was next to the TV in . the hessian bag. 'I was in tears. I thought that when they realised what they were they would tip them out. We rang the police and they searched locally but couldn’t see anything. A neighbour said she had seen some lads jump over the wall with the bag. 'When Robert’s ashes were taken it was like losing him all over again. Everything was still very raw even though we were coming to terms with his death - yet when it happened it was so raw again.' After the burglary Green and the 17-year-old, who was armed with a stick, terrified a young mother who found them in her home. The victim, who had her two-month-old baby with her, barricaded herself into the lounge with the infant, while the pair made off with laptops, cameras and £1,270 cash. The pair and Ludlam were also involved in two other burglaries one in which a Suzuki jeep was stolen and another in which a laptop, wallet and its contents were amongst the haul. In a third raid, the three teenagers stole a Rolex watch a Citroen Saxo. The trio were caught on CCTV trying to disguise themselves and were arrested. Green had £635 on him and the 17-year-old had £590. In mitigation Green’s lawyer Mark . Stuart said the teenager had committed offences since the age of 12. He . had been offered help from agencies like youth offending teams and . social services, but he had resisted it. The . barrister added: 'From the age of 11 to 18, he began to take as many . drugs, of various natures, as he possibly could. It’s an appalling state . of affairs.' In court: Burnley Crown Court was told how Green had been dubbed a teenager from hell and had a long list of previous convictions . Mr Stuart said: 'My client has a communication disorder and problems with social interaction. Undoubtedly he has had his difficulties and he had not helped himself, probably by the amount of drugs he had taken. That will have to stop or he will probably end up killing himself.' Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Peter Atherton said the burglaries had caused the victims much distress and unrecoverable financial loss. He added: 'Their distress has been long-lasting. These have been major life events for them, which they will never forget and which will change their lifestyles adversely.' The judge said the defendants had come from broken families, which had 'devastating consequences for them and for the victims of their many offences, committed through their childhoods and adolescence.' He added: 'It’s had a great financial cost for society, placing heavy burdens on the courts and the caring services.' After the ashes theft, Sgt Eugene Swift, from Lancashire Police had said: 'It’s obviously a callous act and has caused massive amounts of emotional upset to the victim. 'It was stupid and pointless, clearly there was no gain to be had from stealing ashes. They were completely thoughtless as to the effects this crime would have.'

But the sight of a yellow van firmly wedged between two buildings may have made even the most-hardened villager look twice to check that filming hadn't started again. The over-ambitious driver of the van misjudged the width of a narrow lane and ploughed on ahead, but found themselves in a tight spot. An over-ambitious driver found his van was too big for the narrow lanes of Port Isaac in Cornwall . The pretty Cornish village has lots of narrow lanes which were clearly too small for the contractor's firm van to navigate . It looked like the vehicle, which belonged to a contractor's firm, was at risk of losing its wing mirrors - not to mention risking the wrath of the owner of the mounted flowerpot on the wall. The hapless driver was roundly teased for his embarrassing situation by local residents who posted comments online.

"But she was cleared by . magistrates and now intends to sue Sussex Police . By . Stephen Wright . PUBLISHED: . 17:06 EST, 2 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:01 EST, 2 August 2013 . Humiliated: Mother of two Elaine Perry was forced to wear a 'spit hood' When Elaine Perry was threatened by a couple after complaining about their rowdy children, she called police in the hope they would protect her. Instead, the 57-year-old librarian was arrested by two women officers who hooded her, taped her legs together and bundled her into a van in front of a crowd of onlookers. Miss Perry, who says she was made to feel ‘totally humiliated’, ended up in court charged with using threatening behaviour and assaulting one of the officers. But the mother of two was cleared by . magistrates and now intends to sue Sussex Police and complain about her . ordeal to the police watchdog, particularly over the use of the special . hood, designed to prevent prisoners spitting at officers. She was kept in the hood, which looks . like a plastic bag but is made of mesh, for about 15 minutes and . released from it only when she began hyperventilating. ‘I have never been in trouble before . yet I was treated like a criminal for taking a stand on unacceptable . behaviour in a public place,’ she said yesterday. ‘I had no idea British police could . use this type of hood, which would not have looked out of place in . Guantanamo Bay.  I felt I was being paraded in stocks, like in medieval . times. It was so humiliating. ‘I was upset because I was being accused of something I didn’t do and my voice may have been raised. ‘I had a slight sore throat and it is . possible that as I spoke to police, some tiny globules of spit hit an . officer’s face. But it was not deliberate and certainly didn’t merit a . hood being placed over my head.’ Miss Perry’s ordeal began in December . when, while out shopping in Worthing, West Sussex, where she lives, she . remonstrated with a father whose young children were constantly . sounding a car horn. She walked away when his manner . frightened her and went to the chemist. While she was inside the . pharmacy, the children’s mother shouted at her, ‘Wait until you come out . here, you don’t know what I’m going to do to you’, Chichester . magistrates heard. The court was told that as Miss Perry . dialled 999, the mother – who has convictions for assault on police, . affray, disorderly behaviour, robbery and dishonesty – flagged down a . passing police car containing PCs Gemma Bensusan, 33, and Katrina . Saunders, 35. They arrested Miss Perry for using . threatening behaviour, kicking PC Bensusan and another assault – barging . into an elderly woman in the shop who was never identified and did not . make a complaint. Miss Perry wept as she told the court how she was hooded in front of a crowd. ‘I was absolutely terrified, totally . degraded, humiliated,’ she said. She denied she had been out of control, . impolite or threatening. ‘I was upset at being accused of . assaulting an old lady. I would expect a police officer to be fair and . to listen to both sides and I don’t think she [PC Bensusan] did,’ Miss . Perry said. A spit hood similar to the one used on Miss Perry who . claimed it made her feel like she was being 'paraded in stocks' PC Bensusan told the court she used . her spit hood because of the behaviour of Miss Perry, who had refused to . identify herself and was ‘tensing’ to prevent herself being handcuffed. The officer claimed that spit was landing on her face and fleece so she handcuffed Miss Perry after hooding her. Defence barrister Neil FitzGibbon said that under Sussex Police regulations the hoods should be used only if an individual ‘represent a significant risk to the safety of officers’. PC Bensusan admitted she did not know ‘fully’ what the criteria were, adding: ‘At the time I believed it was the correct thing to do.’ PC Saunders admitted she did not know the criteria for when to use a spit hood ‘without looking it up’ and said she did not see the kick her colleague alleged Miss Perry had landed on her. Clearing Miss Perry, magistrates said they were ‘concerned’ that two frontline officers were unfamiliar with force protocols for use of the hoods. Sussex is believed to be one of only two English forces using them. Outside court, Miss Perry said:  ‘I hope this will result in tighter control and better training for the police, so that this treatment is not meted out so lightly in future. Hooding is listed amongst tortures by the United Nations Committee on Torture. ‘I am lucky that I am articulate and have a good support network – others may not, for them such treatment could be devastating.’ A spokesman for Sussex Police said: ‘We did receive a formal complaint about this incident before the court hearing and now the criminal prosecution has finished we will be in touch with the complainant in order to fully look into the matter. ‘Spit hoods, which were introduced in Sussex Police in 2009, have been used 1,291 times. They form part of the personal protective equipment available to operational officers. ‘Spitting has potentially serious health risks for officers and the public and the hoods provide valuable protection. ‘Officers receive training and guidance in the use of spit hoods.’","Elaine Perry arrested after row with father of children sounding car horn .

Comic Relief has called in watchdogs to investigate claims that up to £250,000 donated by the British public to help poor Africans may not have been used for charity. A Ugandan charity is said to have been given £450,000 for health and education projects following Comic Relief’s telethon appeals for cash. But it was alleged yesterday that £50,000 of the sum handed to the Busoga Association UK went to consultants who arranged the charity’s bid for a donation – a large amount for this type of work. And up to £200,000 is still ‘unaccounted for’, it was claimed. Doctor Who actor David Tennant (pictured left) visits a hospital in Uganda to promote Red Nose Day 2011. A Comic Relief spokesman says: 'We vigilantly monitor for attempts to misuse funds and to this end maintain rigorous application and checking systems.' The Charity Commission, which is under fire over its failure to detect fraud, was contacted by Comic Relief four months ago. Yesterday, however, a spokesman for the watchdog said it is still ‘seeking a meeting’ with the London-based Ugandan charity’s trustees and has not decided whether to mount a formal investigation. A report last year by the National Fraud Authority found charities estimate they lose £1.1billion a year to fraud. The latest claims  raise more questions about the effectiveness of the Commission, whose chairman admitted recently to MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee that it  carries out only 20 compliance visits a year, although it regulates 160,000 charities. Celebrity support: former Newcastle football player Alan Shearer is pictured left playing football with local children on a visit to Uganda as he showed his support for the BBC Sport Relief campaign, while celebrities (left to right: Richard Curtis, Lenny Henry, Dermot O'Leary and, sitting, Claudia Winkleman and Emma Freud) who support for Comic Relief . Steve Barclay MP, who sits on the . committee, said: ‘The Charity Commission isn’t fit for purpose. I’m . concerned to hear once again they have been slow to act and use the . powers available to them.  People give money to good causes in good . faith and put their faith in the Charity Commission to ensure their . hard-earned money is well spent. ‘They have powers to suspend trustees, launch statutory inquiries and freeze accounts and yet this rarely happens. Red nose: another popular Comic Relief supporter is Lenny Henry (pictured) who plays to the cameras . ‘Only one trustee has been removed from a charity in the past four years.’ The Charity Commission spokesman said they were approached by Comic Relief ‘expressing concern about funding it has provided to the Busoga Association UK on the basis that insufficient accounting records have been made available to confirm how the grants were applied. ‘The Commission has sought a meeting with the trustees of the charity to discuss what evidence exists concerning the use of the funds in question, together with the charity’s governance and financial management arrangements. ‘Before that meeting the Commission has not formed a view of what the outcome will be in terms of any regulatory advice or action’. The charity, based in Dalston, north-east London, could not be reached by telephone or email yesterday. It was set up in 1996 to help families integrate into the UK, but also has projects in Uganda, including helping women in slum areas. Comic Relief, which has made £800million of grants to charities since it was founded in 1985, said it ‘vigorously’ pursued any abuse of funding and that fraud was rare. A spokesman said: ‘We vigilantly monitor for attempts to misuse funds and to this end maintain rigorous application and checking systems.’","£50,000 of the sum handed to the Busoga Association UK went to consultants, it is alleged .

A grandmother who lied about having cancer in a bid to avoid questioning from tax investigators swindled taxpayers out of £286,000 before blowing it on shopping sprees and holidays. Allison Hawksworth, of Old Basing, Hampshire, who ran a fake children’s clothing company and claimed back a fortune in VAT to which she was not entitled, was today jailed for a year. The 61-year-old, who has three daughters and three grandchildren, lived off benefits and spent her gains on trips to the U.S., TV shopping, a new kitchen and presents for friends and family. And Hawksworth - who carried out her con for ten years - lied about having cancer, a heart attack, and a fractured skull in a bid to avoid questioning when tax investigators came calling. The bogus businesswoman set up the company Kids at Heart to make luxury christening gowns for children in 2002 - but soon found VAT fraud more profitable, Winchester Crown Court heard. She abused the fact that no VAT is paid on children’s clothes to illegitimately claim back thousands of pounds from HM Revenue and Customs. The scam netted her the huge amount without ever having to leave her bungalow. She frittered some of the money away on a holiday to Florida to meet an online friend and a trip to Atlanta, Georgia. Home: The scam netted her the huge amount of money without ever having to leave her bungalow in Old Basing . Prosecutor Dawn Hyland said Hawksworth’s quarterly claims for VAT on materials she had allegedly bought from suppliers began modestly in 2002. But by 2004 the amounts rose to £6,000 and £7,500, peaking at £11,980 in November 2011. In total, she claimed £286,649 - but no business was running, Miss Hyland said. Tax officials became suspicious, but Hawksworth lied about having ovarian cancer, liver cancer and a fractured skull to avoid inspectors. She told an investigator his phone call had ‘been the cause of her requiring hospital treatment for a heart attack’. And she even pretended to be her own daughter, Julia, telling inspectors her ‘mother’ had had a major stroke and was in a nursing home last June. After her eventual arrest in October, she told police she had no memory of ever making the claims or being pursued by investigators over the decade. America trips: She frittered some of the money away on a holiday to Florida to meet an online friend and a trip to Atlanta, Georgia (file picture) Hawksworth pleaded guilty to defraud HMRC on the basis she originally set up Kids at Heart as a genuine business, which prosecutors accepted. She was handed 12 months in prison - but will serve half before being released on parole. 'You told the probation officer that you were operating in a haze, that you did not know what you were doing. That I cannot accept' Judge Jane Miller . Sentencing her, Judge Jane Miller said: ‘You are a 61-year-old lady of previously good character. 'Sadly, there is no money which can be claimed back. You told the probation officer that you were operating in a haze, that you did not know what you were doing. That I cannot accept.’ Lucia Whittle-Martin, defending, said her client was a ‘sad individual’ with ‘deep-seated issues’ who had tried to ‘buy friendship and love’. Speaking after the case, Andrew Sackey of HMRC said: ‘Allison Hawksworth submitted fraudulent VAT repayment claims to cheat honest taxpayers out of nearly £300,000 over 10 years. ‘HMRC is determined to crack down on this type of fraud.’","Allison Hawksworth of Hampshire ran fake children’s clothing firm .

It may be in the same retail group as high-fashion Meccas Topshop and Miss Selfridge but for years BHS has been languishing in the style doldrums. The High Street chain owned by Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group has been regarded as a place for women of a certain age seeking comfortable clothing and practical homewear. Until now. Today the brand has unveiled a slick new collection for next season, and it looks set to give the most glamorous of its High Street competitors a run for their money. They're back! BHS have had a style overhaul and unveiled a fresh and slick new A/W13 collection (Coat £65, blouse £22, skirt £26, croc clutch £20, leather gloves £18) Wearable: The store hope their new collection evokes simplicity, elegance and sophistication (L-belted coat £65, bag £28, R- biker jacket £55, roll neck £10, jeans £22) The new range is designed to evoke 'simplicity, elegance and sophistication' and the store say they hope to offer 'modern-day ladylike glamour combined with structured fits and clean lines'. And all with a purse-friendly price tag. 'BHS Womenswear AW13 is a measured mix of . clever pieces and wardrobe essentials that have created a very wearable . and confident collection designed to suit every woman,' say the store. Easy to wear monochrome is key and comes in the form of . stripes, geometrical prints, florals and bold mono-blocking. And  for the more adventurous there . are plenty of subtle colour injections with tones of emerald, claret, . rust, teal and cobalt. Fashion forward: Monochrome and checks are key to the collection and come in the form of stripes, geometrical prints and bold mono-blocking (L- jumper £28, bag £28, R- pyjama set £28) In a nod to Chanel's Highland trend, classic shapes have been updated with tweed, textured knits, faux leather trimming, quilting and jacquard. And in another homage to high fashion the brand has used super chic model Susannah, who bares a striking resemblance to It girl Cara Delevingne, to showcase the collection. Key looks for the new season are oversized knits or box tops worn with leather or print pencil skirts and the collection also serves up tweed coats, shift dresses and tunics. BHS have also taken note of the sports luxe trend, as championed by Rihanna, Rita Ora and Cara Delevingne, and introduced the style with silk-mix print bomber jackets and a quilted bomber teamed peg-leg trousers. Comfort and style: there are plenty of cosy knits, black jeans and nude heels in the new collection, which starts at £10 (Jumper £25, trousers £22) On trend: Classic shapes have been updated with tweed, textured knits, faux leather trimming, quilting and jacquard (L-tunic £35, roll neck £10, R-textured coat £65, roll neck £10, trousers £22) For outerwear, there are tweed and leather biker jackets, as well as khaki long jackets, which can be teamed with a roll neck and the boyfriend jean. As for footwear, the store have stuck to vintage-inspired styles with low block heel courts, Mary Janes and kitten heels. But for those looking to add a tougher edge, there's sturdy biker boots, jewel coloured suede shoe boots and brogues. BHS A/W13 is available in-store and online. Familiar face: BHS's model, Susannah (left) and her bushy eyebrows bear an uncanny resemblance to model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne (right) BHS began life in the 1970s . and was acquired by Sir Philip Green in 2002 and incorporated into the . Arcadia group in 2009. In early 2006, Philip considered selling the store and contacted rivals including Asda and Debenhams with no success. In 2010, BHS gave itself a brand . overhaul by changing its logo, resurrecting the uppercase form of the . abbreviation, launching an e-commerce website and a new store design. Richard Price is current CEO. BHS has 179 stores nationwide and it has a rolling programme to modernise them; about a quarter of the stores are now in the new formats. BHS has 18 dedicated Home stores across the country. BHS.co.uk offers over 30,000 products with on-line exclusives. BHS is expanding its international portfolio, currently at 90 stores. Pyjama set £28 . It might have been given a glamorous new makeover but BHS has still kept its eye on the retail prize: the 30something professional woman with a bit of money to spend. Like M&S, who has recently turned around its womenswear offering, the brand has listened to its customers and delivered wearable pieces that can be slotted in to an existing wardrobe (complete with longer hemlines and sleeves) rather than chasing the trends and trying to compete with 'younger' brands like Topshop or Primark. Interest comes in flashes of design detail rather than a too-short skirt or plunging neckline and while there is a nod to successful trends from the last few seasons (pyjamas as outerwear, pictured right, were first seen in loud prints on the Stella McCartney S/S '12 catwalk) the success of this collection lies in its simplicity: key pieces in easy-to-wear colours that will update a look without breaking the bank. Favourite pieces include the Crombie-style coat which I'll be wearing with skinny leather trousers and the biker jacket worn with a 60s style polo neck.","British Homes Store makes a comeback with fashionable new collection .

A middle-class pensioner has taken squatting to new heights by 'occupying' a public toilet block to prevent its closure. Campaigner Lin Patterson, 67, has taken up residence in one of the cubicles of Larkhall public loos in Bath with a sleeping bag, food and water. She is furious at plans by Bath and North East Somerset Council to close several public toilets across the area. Ms Patterson believes it is a cost-cutting exercise which hits the most vulnerable in society such as the elderly and disabled. Scroll down for video . Sit-down protest: Linn Patterson, 67, is occupying these toilets in Twerton, Bath, Somerset, to stop the council closing them down . She said: 'These closures are unnecessary, unreasonable and unwanted by the people. 'The priorities are wrong nationally and locally, with huge capital budgets for massive projects that primarily serve vested interests. 'I start with local toilets, which serve one of our most basic human needs, where closure hurts the most vulnerable, elderly, women, children and disabled people.' Ms Patterson has previously been a member of the Save the Larkhall Loo campaign which successfully fought off the closure of toilets near her home in Larkhall, Bath. She set up an online petition to save toilets earmarked for closure, including Combe Down, Peasedown St John, and Twerton. Bedtime: Linn has taken her sleeping bag and other supplies she needs to make her toilet cubicle comfortable to sleep in . Upset: The 67-year-old is unhappy that Bath and North East Somerset Council has earmarked a number of public toilets for closure in order to save money . Armed with her camping equipment, she moved into Twerton loos on Wednesday - the day they were due to close - and intended to stay for three nights. But her one-woman protest has attracted so much local support that she has vowed to continue. A number of local residents have turned out to support her, waving banners reading 'Twerton needs loos' and 'Refuse to lose our loos'. She said: 'I am occupying these toilets for three reasons. 'There was some good campaigning by Twerton people to keep the toilets open, with a petition of 97 signatures handed in and another petition of at least 50 signatures gathered, but many people in Twerton still do not know our toilets are closing, and we need to know and mobilise. 'The second reason is that although I have been campaigning to save the Larkhall toilets, people need all these facilities. 'We are stronger if we work together, so this widens and intensifies the campaign. 'The third reason is to put this in the context of cuts that are unnecessary, unreasonable and unwanted by people who can vote.' Row: Councillors have not been entirely sympathetic to her protest, asking her if who would be willing to clean and open them every day for free . In an open letter to B&NES Council deputy leader Councillor David Dixon, the Save the Larkhall Loo campaign sets out the reasons for keeping the facilities open. It states that one in five people suffer with a variety of urinary or bowel problems who need convenient, accessible toilets, and that closing them would damage local shopping areas as people will stop using them. But Councillor Dixon was unsympathetic to the occupation, saying it was necessary to save £120,000 a year. He wrote on Facebook: 'Seriously, you are occupying some loos. They will start to smell after a few weeks. 'If you fancy cleaning them, opening and locking up each day, that would be great. Enjoy! 'The petition is rather pointless. We have prioritised loos where people stay for longer periods of time such as play areas, those will be kept in better condition too moving forward. 'I have a £120k saving that Council require me to make on loos, I think that we have prioritised the right ones.'","Lin Patterson, 67, is angry at proposals to shut loos across Bath .

Two Air National Guard fighter jets clipped each other's wings midair, forcing one of the pilots to eject into the ocean and be rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter a few hours later off the Virginia coast. The other pilot involved in the collision on Thursday night was able to fly back to Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. Both jets were from the 113th Wing D.C. Air National Guard and were on a routine training mission when the collision happened about 35 miles southeast of Chincoteague on Virginia's Eastern Shore. Scroll down for video . The fighter jets clipped each other's wings midair, forcing one of the pilots to eject into the ocean off the Virginia coast (coast guard video footage) The Coast Guard helicopter rescued the pilot a few hours later off the Virginia coast (Coast Guard video footage) Capt. Michael Odle, chief of public affairs for the air wing, said the jets collided when their wings clipped each other. Odle didn't specify the exact maneuvers the pilots were going through, but he noted that the air wing's pilots are frequently called upon to intercept aircraft that enter restricted airspace or lose communications in the Washington area. Those intercepts typically require aircraft to fly in close proximity. The Air National Guard has not released the names of the pilots involved, but Odle said both are experienced pilots. One is a captain, and the other is a lieutenant colonel. The Coast Guard said the pilot of the jet who was rescued early Friday is in good condition. Odle said the other pilot has already been evaluated by medical staff and released. 'We are extremely fortunate to have lost only metal, and not the life of one of our Airmen,' Brig. Gen. Marc Sasseville, 113th Wing commander, said in a statement. The pilot is seen in the ocean after ejecting himself midair from the fighter jet . The Coast Guard is seen lowering down help from the helicopter to the pilot in the ocean . The Coast Guard said it was alerted to the pilot's ditching by a distress signal from his ejection seat at about 10:30 p.m. An MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter that was based at Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C. arrived around midnight, according to the Coast Guard. It was faster to send the helicopter instead of a small boat from Chincoteague, said Petty Officer David Weydert, a spokesman for the Coast Guard's 5th District in Portsmouth, Va. At the time of the rescue, seas in the area were about 4 feet high. Three other planes were also taking part in the training, and one remained in the area to help guide Coast Guard rescuers to the downed pilot, Odle said. The downed pilot was wearing a life vest and had a handheld radio with him in his life raft that enabled him to communicate with the pilot that remained in the area, according to the Coast Guard. That pilot relayed the information until the Coast Guard helicopter could get close enough to communicate directly. The pilots were flying F-16s off the coast of Virginia, like these ones pictured in Alabama . Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Bret Fogle, the rescue swimmer on the operation, said it was pitch black outside during the rescue, but the downed pilot followed his training and lit rescue flares so he could be found. He said the pilot's demeanor was calm when he reached him, even though his right knee was in an incredible amount of pain. He said putting the pilot on a board so he could be lifted into the helicopter felt like he was putting the pilot's knee through torture because it was swollen to the size of a grapefruit and appeared to be broken. 'He was actually just a very tough dude. When I saw his knee and saw how he was handling it, the first thing in my mind was like, `How the hell do you get in this raft and why are you so calm?' His training kicked in obviously, because he did everything right.' Fogle said he's been a rescue swimmer for 13 years. This is the first time he or anyone else he knows has rescued a pilot that's had to eject into the water, but he said the Coast Guard regularly trains for such a scenario. He said the rescue was the highlight of his career. 'We'll usually rescue civilian fishermen or cruise ships,' he said. 'To actually be able to get the opportunity to help somebody out, to help this caliber of a person for what he does for our country and everything, is just a really neat feeling.'","Both pilots are in good condition and recovering well .

A collection of photographs taken during the controversial 1903 British Expedition to Tibet has come to light. The sepia-toned pictures were taken by an officer during the British invasion of Tibet - the first time a Westerner had captured the likes of Mount Everest on film. The set of 140 photographs show the Gyantse Dzong fortress and some of the Tibetan men, women and children in the villages that the troops passed during their advance towards the capital Lhasa. Mount Everest, as seen through the lens of Captain William Hayman during the 1903 British Expedition to Tibet . The invading British forces set up camp near Everest on their journey to the capital Lhasa from India . Young monks were photographed on the steps of their temple, holding the temple's horns . Captain Hayman, whose descendants are selling his collection at auction, also photographed older monks at the temple . Lord Curzon, the head of the ruling British government in India, feared Russia had its sights set on the country following its advances into Central Asia. By April 1903, Russia told the British Government that it had no intentions of invading India, but Curzon insisted troops should go to Tibet to make its officials sign a convention to promise Russia would not be allowed to interfere in its affairs. Tibet was the only Himalayan kingdom at the time to not be under colonial British rule. The expedition, led by Colonel Younghusband, began in December 1903 and lasted until the following September. Between 2,000 and 3,000 Tibetans are thought to have been killed by the advancing British troops. Britain lost 202 men from its 3,000-strong force because of fighting, while 411 died of other causes. Young monks in training are seen alongside older men of faith, while people working the land with yak-carts are also pictured. The British Army's weapons are shown, with soldiers manning a Maxim machine gun, while lines of tents act as shelter for the men. Some are even seen posing for souvenir pictures outside buildings on their route in the collection which belonged to Captain William Hayman, who is thought to have taken many of them himself. Early in the campaign, troops gunned down 700 lightly-armed Tibetan monks standing in their path in the Massacre of Chumik Shenko. The slaughter was so brutal that Lieutenant Arthur Hadow, commander of the Maxim guns detachment, wrote afterwards: 'I got so sick of the slaughter that I ceased fire. 'I hope I shall never again have to shoot down men walking away.' The expedition began in December 1903 when 3,000 troops marched into the country from British-ruled India, led by Colonel Francis Younghusband. It was initiated by Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, who was obsessed with preventing Russia gaining influence in Tibet. The men reached Lhasa in August 1904, when the government signed a treaty effectively turning the country into a British protectorate. The archive is now being sold by Captain Hayman's descendants after being left in a drawer for years. Tibetan men, women and children had their photograph taken by the officer as the troops advanced through Tibet . The fortress Gyantse Dzong fell to the British in July 1904 after a determined defence by Tibetans . Captain Hayman also photographed yaks at work on the land on Tibetan Plateau . The collection of photographs, which would have been the first time a Westerner captured the landscapes on film, is expected to fetch £1,200 at auction . The collection is expected to fetch £1,200 when it goes under the hammer in Devizes, Wiltshire, next week. Andrew Aldridge, from auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, said: 'The Younghusband expedition to Tibet was a controversial one but it did provide us with the first ever photos of the country. 'Anything to do with the expedition is incredibly collectable but an archive of this size, variety and quality is unheard of. 'Cameras were quite available in those days and it is thought the photos were taken by one of the soldiers rather than an official photographer. The British camp, which was made up of soldiers, sherpas and porters, is shown flying the Union Jack in front of Everest . A picture taken by Ignatius Sequeira is among Captain Hayman's collection, showing the expedition leader Colonal Younghusband, front centre, with the captain, right, and other officers of the British Indian Army . A Maxim gun crew is seen with their sleeves rolled up as they sit behind their weapon . Soldiers also found time to pose for photographs on their way into Tibet, including this serviceman standing under a structure marked with Chinese symbols . 'They have been passed down through generations and are being sold by direct descendants of the soldiers. 'They sat unseen in a drawer up until recently and have never been published before. 'These photos offer a fascinating insight into a time when the British Empire was at its peak and we were exploring and colonising the world. 'There is a big market for anything to do with Tibet, especially the exploration of the country. 'We are anticipating a lot of interest in this archive.' A cavalry officer of the British Indian Army looks to be standing under the same structure to be photographed alongside his horse .

"By . Lydia Slater . PUBLISHED: . 17:14 EST, 24 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:52 EST, 25 July 2013 . Like many women, I buy clothes because I like the way they look on skinny models in fashion magazines. But unlike them I am 43, a size 12 and mother of two children, so I’ve also learned to try to disguise my problem areas. I know my husband would rather see me in tight dresses but I prefer floaty clothes which are a size too big for me and hide a multitude of sins. Or do they? Mail fashion editor Eliza Scarborough took four wardrobe staples to show how the right outfit can make me look a stone lighter, and the wrong one a stone heavier... Fattening, left: Pleated maxi dress, £199, tedbaker.com. Sandals, £85.50, russellandbromley.co.uk . Slimming, right: Illusion panel dress, £75, phase-eight.co.uk. Sandals, £39.99, zara.com . FATTENING, PLEATED MAXI DRESS: I feel like a Greek goddess in this halterneck maxi dress, but when I really look at my reflection, I realise that, sadly, I don’t resemble one. It looks as if my head is poking out of the top of a festival tent - there’s room for my whole family in here - and the halterneck that I believed was a failsafe flatterer makes my shoulders look broad. I thought the loose shape would skim over my physique, but without a belt it makes me look shapeless. Perhaps if I were in my 20s, with toned, slender arms, I might be able to carry off this dress. As it is, I just look as though I have rather a lot to hide. I’ve easily gained a stone just by putting this on. SLIMMING, ILLUSION PANEL DRESS: When even supermodels like Kate Moss and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley wear illusion dresses to enhance their perfectly proportioned physiques, it would seem sensible to take notice. But I’ve never liked these dresses: they look a bit comical, somehow, and surely the optical illusion is too obvious to fool anyone? But when Eliza finally convinces me to try this on, I really like it.  It’s not too tight or revealing, but it is alluring, though a little too obviously sexy for my taste. Importantly though, the dark panels at the sides definitely make me look thinner. A stone seems to have instantly vanished. Fattening, left: Wrap dress, £79, phase-eight.co.uk. Sandals, £29.99, zara.com. Slimming, right: Tunic dress, £40, oasis-stores.com. Shoes, £39.99, zara.com . FATTENING, HORIZONTAL STRIPES: I adore horizontal stripes. I own at least five Breton tops and a horizontal-striped dress, so I love this graphic tunic as soon as I see it. It’s fun and funky, and I think the straight shape is elegant and youthful. But once I’ve put it on, as Eliza gently helps me see, I realise that I look like a giant bee or a zebra crossing. The horizontal stripes make me look so much wider, while the dress hangs unflatteringly from my shoulders, with no hint of a waist underneath. Based on what I’ve seen today, I fear my beloved stripy tops may have to go! SLIMMING, DIAGONAL STRIPES: I can see the appeal of this pretty striped dress to other women, but I’d never have considered it for myself. It’s not just the lack of sleeves or the plunging neckline that would have put me off; it’s the whole Fifties style, which I never imagined could suit me. I’ve always been athletic rather than curvy, so I thought looser styles were more flattering for my shape. To my surprise, I found the nipped-in waist and diagonal stripes drew the eye and gave me the hourglass shape I’ve never had. I look so much slimmer! The diagonal stripes are definitely a trick I’d try again. Fattening: Left, top, £30, and linen trousers, £39, hobbs.co.uk. Sandals, £85.50, and clutch, £255, russellandbromley.co.uk. Slimming: right, green peplum top, £35, jaeger.co.uk. Blue bow belt, £29,hobbs.co.uk. Navy slim-leg trousers, £89, reiss.com . FATTENING, PASTELS: Like strawberries and cream, the combination of white linen trousers and a mint-green linen top seems perfect for a summer’s day. On the hanger, both items exude casual elegance. But once  on, the baggy trousers swamp me, and the drawstring waist doesn’t help at all. While a tighter top may work better, this floppy number makes me look big. This is an especially galling realisation as I have a pair of almost identical trousers at home, which I wear with a linen shirt. The outfit may have to go. SLIMMING, DARK, BOLD COLOURS: These trousers are a hit: dark blue, body skimming and stretchy, they streamline my legs beautifully. I’m wary of the top - I don’t like the colour or the lack of sleeves - but once I get it on, I realise that I’ve got it horribly wrong again, and Eliza has got it absolutely right. The peplum actually makes my waist look narrower - an effect which is enhanced by the skinny belt. I would never have chosen this outfit myself, but I have to admit I really like it. Fattening, left: pleated midi skirt, £49, jaeger.co.uk. Top, £35, reiss.co.uk. Jacket, £59, and shoes, £79, hobbs.co.uk. Slimming, right: Pencil skirt, £140, jaeger.co.uk. Top, £28, johnlewis.com. Heels, £67, hobbs.co.uk . FATTENING, PLEATS: A pleated mid-length skirt teamed with a jacket and high heels is my failsafe choice for summer weddings and smart events. But looking at this picture, I’m going to have to rethink that. The pleats on the skirt add extra bulk to my hips, while the length cuts off my calves at their widest point. And looking at it carefully, I realise my usual choice of a boxy jacket is stiff. It hangs straight from my shoulders and skims my waist, making me look square. Regardless, it’s more comfortable - and classier - than the ‘slimming’ skirt. I think I’ll chance the extra stone. SLIMMING, TIGHT AND HIGH-WAISTED: While I like the sexy secretary look on other women - Joan from Mad Men springs to mind - I never thought I could carry it off myself. This tight, high-waisted skirt looks as though it would cling to every lump and bump, while the draped top is too revealing for my tastes. But once I’ve wriggled into it, the slimline skirt does make me look leaner and several inches taller. And while I’d feel more relaxed with the addition of a jacket, the wrap top is less revealing than I’d feared. This look just isn’t me, though. I may look slimmer, but I don’t feel comfortable. I’ve spent years swamping myself in clothes that are too big for me, thinking they make me look slimmer. Now, rather late in the day, I realise that showing off my body — with all its imperfections — is wiser and more flattering. Forget the diet - losing a stone was simple with a few clever wardrobe tweaks. I’m amazed by what this experiment has taught me - but nobody else seems to be! ‘I’ve always hated you in linen,’ my mother tells me. ‘It makes you look so much larger than you are.’ (Why she hasn’t said anything for 43 years is beyond me.) My husband, of course, is delighted, and dives eagerly into my wardrobe in search of the items he detests most. He quickly amasses a huge reject pile in the middle of the bedroom floor: on it, a beloved floaty, full-length blue cotton skirt, linen trousers, the stripy dress and a waistless green satin shirt I’ve just bought in the sales. ‘You can dump anything sludge-coloured too!’ he continues gleefully, adding several beige and cream T-shirts to the heap. Eventually, all I have left are a couple of figure-hugging dresses, a pair of skinny jeans and my best suit. Time for some serious shopping, but only if I can take Eliza with me.

"By . Ulla Kloster . PUBLISHED: . 12:16 EST, 2 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:19 EST, 3 August 2013 . Ex police officer Rebecca Swanston, 28, arrives at court this morning in Winchester for sentencing. She pleaded guilty to three counts of misconduct after being involved with known criminals . A corrupt former police constable was today jailed for three years for leaking confidential information to four different criminals she was having sex with. Rebecca Swanston, 28, who used to work for the Hampshire force, sabotaged her own force's investigations and stopped them catching offenders, Winchester Crown Court heard. She pleaded guilty at Winchester Crown Court to three counts of misconduct in a public office between January and October 2012. The woman officer allowed one dealer to leave a 'massive bag' of crack cocaine and heroin on a table at her house. And she failed to report confessions made to her by the men, including details of a vicious machete attack and the kidnapping of a wealthy businessman. The court also heard she told the men police were out looking for them and suggested to one that he get rid of his mobile phone. In addition, she allowed one man to keep two of her police-issue T-shirts and may even have had sex with one while on duty, the court heard. The constable was warned about her relationships with criminals after a photograph of her with one of them was spotted on a website. Hampshire Constabulary launched an anti-corruption probe into her behaviour and installed a listening bug at her home in Southampton, Hants. It recorded her discussing police operations with the criminals - and even having sex with some of them. Text messages suggest she had sex with at least one dealer while on duty, the court heard.In one recording she is heard to say: '(He) comes around here with a massive bag filled with crack and heroin and just leaves it on the table.'That's mad, innit? That's how much he trusts me. I wouldn't ever say...' And in another she says: 'While I've been with him, he's been wanted for a stabbing. He's told me everything the night it happened.' Rebecca Swanston was based at Southampton Central Police Station (pictured). She committed the offences over a 10-month period between January and October last year . Swanston, who was based at Southampton Central Police Station, was arrested during a raid on her house on October 18 last year. One of the dealers was even there at the time. Prosecutor Zoe Martin said: 'Between January and October 2012, the defendant was involved in intimate relationships with a number of active criminals in the Southampton area, and passed confidential information to some of them. 'At least two of the men concerned confessed their participation in serious crime to her while they were wanted or on police bail for the offences in question. 'In due course, PC Swanston's conduct came to the attention of the Professional Standard's Anti-Corruption Unit and was investigated. As a result, she was arrested on October 18 and interviewed under caution. Swanston, of Lomond Close, Portsmouth, was dismissed from Hampshire Police in November 2012. Restrictions had been imposed on her - she had been ordered to sleep at her home address, not enter a given area and her passport had to remain logged with Hampshire Police . 'She made no comment in interview, but admitted gross misconduct in the fast-track disciplinary proceedings that then followed. 'She was dismissed from the force without notice on November 27, 2012.' Swanston today admitted three counts of misconduct in a public office over ten months, between January and October last year. During this time she logged onto the police's Records Management System, which contained information about criminals and operations, over 250 times. The court heard most of these 'appeared to be improper use'. Swanston became a police officer in February 2009 and was dismissed in November 2012 after the misconduct hearing. The court heard one case in which she was to be a significant witness was dropped because the CPS considered her tainted. One of the defendants in that case later went on to supply drugs to a person who died as a result. Matthew Jewell, defending, said Swanston was embarrassed officers had 'eavesdropped on her most intimate moments.'He added: 'The defendant is remorseful. She entered these relationships and found herself unable to bring them to an end. She was not doing this for financial gain.' Jailing Swanston for three years, Judge Jane Miller QC said: 'You embarked on a course of self-destructive behaviour, starting relationships with not just one man known to be a criminal but four different men. 'All were heavily involved in hard, class A drug supply. 'Once in these relationships, you started on a course of criminal behaviour yourself. You knew what you were doing and you made your own choices. 'Your offences have damaged police operations and significantly so. 'You did not have to pass on police information as a result of your sexual relationships.' Swanston - with black hair and a low-cut figure-hugging dress - shook her head continuously throughout the hearing. She was originally arrested in October 2012 along with another female police constable, aged 29. This officer was released with no further action in November but resigned after receiving a final written warning following misconduct proceedings in March. Four men arrested at the same time last October in connection with the investigation were released with no further action. Detective Superintendent Colin Smith, head of Hampshire Constabulary's Professional Standards Department, said: 'Rebecca Swanston's corrupt behaviour and reckless associations with known criminals went totally and utterly against the values of honesty and integrity required of her as a police officer. 'Former PC Swanston's behaviour is in no way typical of Hampshire Constabulary employees.'","Sentenced to three years’ imprisonment .

In a time of uncertainty, like a global financial crisis, it makes sense that this is how men want to be seen. Also if we consider the beard as a fashion trend, it's the best accessory a man can own - it's free, completely unique, very personal and not too flashy,' says Pryce. 'As a trend, the beard won't last. That's the nature of trends - they come and go. However, I reckon the resurgence of the appreciate of the hirsute is here to stay for a while. Once you've dedicated time and energy cultivating a beard it's unlikely you'll be giving it up at the drop of a hat. For many of the men I photographed their beard wasn't trend-led, it was as much a form of personal expression as the hair on their head. 'It's so difficult to place as there is a huge variety. For me I think density, colour and shape are all important factors. I've photographed one man with a huge sprawling white beard  - completely unkempt and natural.

'The 100 Beards, 100 Days project started on July 1st 2012 and the original concept was simple. I went out to different neighbourhoods in London every day for the next 100 days until October 8th, and over that period the blog had really exploded. In the final month, nearly every guy I stopped to be photographed had heard of the blog which was incredible. I was receiving comments, Tweets & emails en mass from fans of facial hair asking to continue documenting London's beards, so I decided to continue. 'I've been taking beard portraits for 13 months now, mostly in London but also in Paris, Milan and Berlin. I've now reached number 146 on the blog, but I'm planning to have 200 beard portraits for the release of the book next month. Possibly the hardest part of this kind of work is selecting the portraits to use. I've photographed more than 200 men, but only the right portraits get used. The book will include funny quotes and anecdotes about their beards from the subjects. 'When I first started the 100 Beards project, I had a lot of people Tweeting me asking if I had a beard myself.

I spent about 8 weeks working on getting some good growth and on Day 100 took a self-portrait to complete the first chapter. 'One of the reasons I became interested in beards was my own inability to grow a good one. Beards have this mysterious masculinity attached to them and to grow a strong one is like the holy grail of authenticity. Once I got past the itchy phase of the beard I started to enjoy it, but mine pales in comparison to the men I photographed so it's now gone. Stubble will have to be enough for me.

In news that will come as no surprise to many long-suffering British women, fashion, dancing and multitasking have been named as the skills British men are worst at. New research out today found men are also woeful at remembering significant dates such as birthdays and anniversaries, carrying out most domestic chores and buying clothes for a partner. They also lack skill at buying gifts in general, picking home furniture and cooking more complicated dishes. While some British men think they have the 'moves like Jagger' or the fashion sense of a young Versace, many more are less confident . Researchers said the findings showed modern men still rely on women to do the majority of chores and tasks that should involve both partners in a relationship. However, it seems men can be relied upon to hurt themselves doing DIY, buy wrong size clothes for a partner and get drunk at a family function. They are also more likely than women to miss a flight after sleeping in, forget to pick up children from school or an event, forget an anniversary or birthday and miss work because of a hangover. The survey of 1,000 adults was commissioned by sauce brand Frank’s Red Hot for the launch of its pop-up men’s skill schools in London and Manchester, in which experts will pass on tips on everything from dancing to fashion to remembering key dates. The poll found 36 per cent of men believe they lack cooking skills, 38 per cent think they are bad at dancing and 36 per cent think they are terrible when it comes to public speaking. Perhaps surprisingly, 35 per cent of men thought they were no good at DIY, while 21 per cent did not rate their chances on the sports field. Not only do British men struggle to remember significant dates, they also lack skills in buying present . Men also rated themselves low when it comes to buying gifts for a loved one (52 per cent), remembering birthdays or anniversaries (33 per cent) and doing domestic chores (30 per cent). 1 Buying clothes for partner 52% . 2 Remembering anniversary/birthday 41% . 3 Dancing 33% . 4 Ironing 31% . 5 Cooking 30% . 6 Domestic chores 30% . 7 Buying gifts 28% . 8 Multitasking 22% . 9 Keeping up with fashion 22% . 10 Picking furniture 21% . In fact, the only skills that men rate themselves as better than women at are killing insects, changing a car tyre and putting up shelves. They also rate themselves better in the gender stakes at playing video games, barbequing and playing sport. Both sexes agree that men are generally better at some things - such as telling jokes, tying a bow tie, fixing computer problems and eating spicy food. However, there is only a slim chance that men will improve in the gender race - three in four (76 per cent) say they are “good enough at the skills they care about”. It’s bad news for the opposite sex, with nearly one in 10 (nine per cent) of women desperately wishing their partner was better at a range of skills. Four in 10 (43 per cent) of all the survey respondents thought men were generally worse than women at many life skills, while a third (32 per cent) said today’s men are no better than their fathers at certain skills. A spokesman for Frank’s Red Hot said: 'Our research shows many men are lacking in skills which women seem to have grasped. 'In fact, time seems to have stood still for many men when it comes to skills like ironing, shopping, multitasking and keeping up with fashion. 'We hope this research is a rude awakening to those millions of men who still rely on their partners for a variety of skills round the home.'","Buying clothes for a partner is the skill British men lack most .

As the debate in Britain rages on over plain cigarette packaging, Australia is set to crack down further on smoking with a 50 per cent hike in the rate of tobacco tax. The country introduced the world's harshest packaging laws when it outlawed all branding on cigarette packets except for the name of the manufacturer, printed in small type. The packages boast graphic photographs of diseased body parts, including gangrenous limbs, and of smokers dying from cancer. Gory: Cigarettes in Australia must carry graphic images instead of branding from the manufacturer . The British Government had pledged to introduce a similar law in the UK, but performed a U-turn last month - allegedly in response to lobbying from the tobacco industry. Australian ministers today announced that taxes on tobacco will rise by 12.5 per cent in each of the next four years. The country is believed to have the second most expensive cigarettes in the world behind only Norway, with the average pack costing around A$13.50 (£8). But this will climb still higher following today's decision by treasurer Chris Bowen, who is aiming to eliminate the government's deficit. Offputting: But it is not clear how effective plain cigarette packaging really is . Warning: Packets in Australia carry photographs of cancer patients in a bid to deter smokers . The price of an average pack is expected to rise by A$5 over the four-year period, raising a total of A$5.3billion. 'This I know won't be universally popular with all,' Mr Bowen said. 'It's a difficult decision but a decision which is taken in the best interests of the nation.' Since December 1, all packs of cigarettes sold in Australia have borne gruesome photographs instead of manufacturer's branding. The Coalition Government was planning to impose the same rules in Britain, but last month decided to delay the law so officials could study how the policy works in Australia. Crackdown: The Australian government has announced a massive hike in tobacco tax . Labour accused the Government of being influenced by Tory strategist Lynton Crosby, whose lobbying firm has previously worked for British American Tobacco. However, ministers have insisted that it is sensible to wait for more evidence before imposing new legislation. The effects of the Australian law have so far been mixed - although many smokers say they are more likely to grow up, cigarette makers have not seen a significant dent in sales. A study of 500 Australian smokers showed most believed their cigarettes were less satisfying and of lower quality than a year ago, with most also thinking more about quitting. However, BAT said: 'There has been no noticeable impact on legal tobacco sales in the first six months due to plain packaging.'","£3.1billion tax hike aims to cut down tobacco use and slash deficit .

A Chinese immigrant charged with killing her baby by eating rat poison while she was pregnant pleaded guilty Friday to a misdemeanor count of criminal recklessness as part of a deal with prosecutors. Bei Bei Shuai, 36, pleaded guilty to criminal recklessness and was sentenced to time served, which was 178 days, Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Charges of murder and feticide were dropped. Curry said he decided to accept the lesser charge because a number of evidentiary rulings by the court had hurt the prosecution's case. He says he decided to accept the lesser charge rather than to appeal those decisions. Free woman: Bei Bei Shuai addresses the media after her accepting a plea deal in court yesterday . Ordeal: Bei Bei Shuai following her arrest for the murder of her three-day-old daughter Angel Shuai . 'There were evidentiary rulings that would have made our case difficult to proceed,' he said. 'We felt it was appropriate to resolve it with the plea and with some acknowledgement of culpability and everyone can move on.'A message was left at the office of Shuai's attorney, Linda Pence, by the Associated Press late Friday afternoon seeking comment. Prosecutors had argued that Shuai, a Shanghai native, killed her child by eating rat poison in December 2010, when she was eight months pregnant. Shuai gave birth to Angel on December 31. The baby died three days later. Legal support: Shuai (right) leans on her attorney Linda Pence following her release from prison on bail in 2012 . Landmark case: Shuai addresses supporters at a rally protesting her indictment . Among the rulings that hurt the prosecution's case was one in January when a judge ruled that Dr Jolene Clouse, who performed the autopsy on newborn Angel Shuai, didn't consider other possible causes for the brain bleeding that caused her death, including a drug that Shuai received while she was in the hospital.The case drew international attention from reproductive rights advocates who contended it could set a precedent by which pregnant women could be prosecuted for smoking or other behavior that authorities deem dangerous to their unborn child. Headline-making: Shuai's case gained the attention of reproductive rights advocates all over the world . About 80 organizations have filed friend-of-the-court briefs on Shuai's behalf, and more than 10,000 people from Australia to New York have signed an online petition supporting her.But Curry said those arguments weren't a factor in the case.'While well-intended, those assertions have been completely incorrect from the start. There was never any intention to monitor pregnancies. As has been pointed out on more than one occasion, Indiana appellate courts have already weighed in on those issues,' he said.The plea agreement states that the two sides believe the conviction 'will not trigger adverse immigration consequences,' and if it does the plea agreement will be set aside.The trial was scheduled to begin September 3.","Bei Bei Shuai, 36, pleaded guilty to criminal recklessness in a plea deal .

A snowboarder traveling through an ice tunnel on Oregon's Mount Hood with five companions was found dead nearly 14 hours after the passageway collapsed on top of him. The man trapped beneath the snow was identified today by authorities as Collin Backowski, 25, a professional snowboarder from Pines, Colorado. Rescuers spent two days trying to dig Backowski out from under 8 to 10 feet of snow and ice. Collin Backowski, a 25 year-old snowboarder, was buried alive under snow and ice on Mt. Hoot in Oregon after a passageway collapsed on him . It took a crew of 12 people hours to dig out Backowski's body, according to KATU.com. The rescuers had to remove several dense tons of debris from the cave in spot by hand, authorities said in a release, the website reported. Backowski was described by friends as 'an extremely nice and giving person who is always the life of the party,' according to EveryJoe.com. In 2012 Backowski snowboarded as part of the Never Summer Industries team, a Colorado-based snowboard and long board manufacturer. In his profile on the company's website Backowski wrote, 'I love everything about snowboarding, Nothing better than riding with your hommies at your favorite spots.'

They also attempted . to dig their friend out, but were unable to break through thick snow . and ice. Grant Giller, one of the five companions told KATU the group went up the mountain to scout locations to take pictures. 'Two days ago I went and scouted a crevasse to jump over,' Giller said. 'One of the kids up there is a professional snowboarder like . myself. Two of the guys up there I know are photographers. So we were . just going to take some photos.' Backowski was traveling on the mountain with five friends who called authorities once the passage collapsed . Friends say that Backowski is the 'life of the party.' The young snowboarder was trapped as of 4pm Saturday . Seven rescuers, including five members of . an all-volunteer group called the CragRats responded immediately, but . had to halt their attempt around 11pm as weather conditions would not . permit them to continue. Warm . temperatures made snow on the mountain slushier and more easily . sloughed off the surface, adding to the challenge of attempting to reach . the snowboarder. ‘They tried digging for an hour, but the problem is the stuff is so thick that they couldn't get through it,’ said Hood River Sheriff's Office Sgt. Pete Hughes. ‘We're getting chainsaws, if that's any indication.’ Collin Backowski worked in 2012 as a professional snowboarder representing the Never Summer Team out of Colorado . According to the five other young men with him Backowski was hit by a chunk of ice as big as a school bus . Rescue crews were sent back to the mountain at dawn this morning to resume efforts to find Backowski (pictured here in happier times) under better weather conditions . Backowski's companions  took pictures of the area just before the tunnel collapsed, Hughes . said, giving searchers a better idea of where to search. An airplane was dispatched to survey the area, along with crews from local sheriff's offices. Earlier reports from police incorrectly stated there were seven people in the group. The initial reports also referred to an avalanche, but it was not immediately clear if one had occurred.

An American diplomat who police say was speeding, crossed the center line in his SUV and rammed into a full mini-bus, killing a father of three whose widow is six months pregnant, officials said Friday. U.S. Embassy officials in Nairobi rushed Joshua Walde and his family out of Kenya the next day, leaving the crash victims with no financial assistance to pay for a funeral and for hospital bills for the eight or so others who were seriously injured. Amongst those killed was Haji . Lukindo, who leaves behind his pregnant wife Latifah Naiman Mariki, 38, without a source of income to support her family. Latifah Naiman Mariki, the pregnant widow of a man killed in a car accident by an American diplomat that has since fled the country, poses outside of her home in Nairobi, Kenya with two of her children . Mariki, was almost evicted from her house this week after her landlord demanded rent. Mariki's deceased husband, Haji Lukindo, was the family's only source of income. She told The Associated Press that neither the American driver nor anyone at the US Embassy has contacted her, and she doesn't know how she will provide for her soon-to-be-born child and three children, ages 20, 10 and 7. 'It is difficult for me to handle this matter because my kids need to go to school. They need everything, basic needs,' Mariki said. 'And we have no place to stay because we have to pay the rent. We have no money. ... Even if my kids are sick I have no money to take them to hospital.' Naiman (second from the right) sits with her children in the home she can no longer afford after her husband was killed by American diplomat Joshua Walde's speeding SUV . Hilary Renner, a State Department spokeswoman in Washington, said the embassy extends its deepest condolences to Mariki's family and wishes a speedy recovery to those injured. She said she couldn't comment on whether the embassy employee would return to Kenya. 'The embassy is fully cooperating with the Kenyan authorities as they investigate the accident and work to aid the victims,' she said. Walde, was an information management officer at the Nairobi embassy when he got in the crash on his way home the evening of July 11. He gave a statement to police but because he has diplomatic immunity he was not detained. Latifah Naiman's (pictured here) friends and neighbors are petitioning for financial aid and accountability from Walde after he was allowed to leave the country following the crash . A police dossier on the case shown briefly to an Associated Press reporter contained sketches of how police believe the accident happened. The sketch shows the American's SUV turning at a rounded four-way intersection on the edge of Nairobi and driving into the lane of oncoming traffic. A police officer familiar with the case who insisted he not be identified by name because he is not an official spokesman said of Walde,' He was driving very fast.' Pictures in the dossier show that the SUV hit the front corner and side of the mini-bus, smashing in its frame. Kenyan mini-buses, known as matatus, also frequently drive fast and erratically. Joshua Walde was working as a information management officer in Nairobi, Kenya when he crashed his speeding SUV into a full mini-bus killing one and injuring eight more . A Facebook group of Kenyan mothers took up Mariki's case this week and are trying to raise funds for her. In dozens of comments online, many demanded accountability and expressed dismay that no financial help has been given. 'She's such a decent and honest lady you feel so bad for her. She wasn't employed,' Zahra Ashif, who started the Facebook thread, told AP. 'The point is that [Walde] is not here so he can't be arrested, but after that point did he not have any courtesy to get in touch? ... For them life has gone on, but what about these kids?' Walde is an 11-year employee of the State Department who has worked in Kazakhstan, Uruguay and Croatia. Shortly after the crash, Walde updated his work history on the networking site LinkedIn to put his time in Nairobi in the past tense, from July 2012 to July 2013. Latifah Naiman (second from right) sits with her three children and is pregnant with a fourth. Her husband was killed in a crash by an American diplomat who fled the country . After the Facebook group noticed the updated resume and pointed to that as evidence that Walde would not return to face charges or help victims, the LinkedIn account was deleted, though a cached version is still available through Google. Walde's wife circulated an email to sell a family vehicle and try to find new work locations for the family's nanny and gardener after the crash. AP sent an email to Walde's wife on Thursday asking if the family wanted to comment. No response was received. The U.S. government is concerned about the impact the accident could have on bilateral relations with Kenya, a U.S. government official said. The official noted that embassy employees are typically evacuated for medical evaluations after traumatic events but are also flown out of a country to avoid any possible retribution or attack from others involved in an accident. The crash that killed Latifah Naiman's (right) husband happened when Joshua Walde's SUV allegedly swerved into a lane of oncoming traffic at a four-way intersection . The police say the case remains under investigation. The Nairobi traffic police chief, Patrick Lumumba, said he is seeking assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to liaise with the U.S. Embassy. He said authorities didn't detain Walde because, 'we don't take diplomats into custody.' A police spokeswoman, Ziporah Mboroki, said no charges had been filed against Walde the last time she checked. 'He is a diplomat and has the privileges of a diplomat. If you're a diplomat and you commit any crime in Kenya, the case is investigated and is forwarded to your embassy,' she said. 'That's what the law says and we work per the law.'","Joshua Walde, an American diplomat stationed in Kenya, who was allegedly speeding, crashed his SUV into a full mini-bus, killing one and injuring eight more .

Controversial: Incoming Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has already upset Israel with comments made in a television interview two days before his inauguration . Iran's president-elect has dashed hopes of a period of calm with Israel after he described the country as a 'wound' that needs to be removed from the Middle East. Hassan Rouhani made the contentious comments in a state-run television interview about the occupation of Palestinian land just days ahead of his inauguration as Iran's new leader. According to Iranian press reports, he said: 'The Zionist regime is a wound that has sat on the body of the Muslim world for years and needs to be removed.' The comments, made on Quds Day, an annual event held in Iran to support Palestinians and denounce Israel, were described as 'hostile' by Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu. He said: ‘The true face of Rouhani has been . revealed sooner than expected ... this is what the man thinks and this . is the Iranian regime’s plan of action. 'A nation that threatens to destroy the state of Israel must not be allowed to have weapons of mass destruction,' he said in a statement. The comments echo those made by outgoing president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who threatened Israel in his final speech as leader warning that a 'ferocious storm' would strike the nation. But Rouhani has been quick to distance himself from the comments, with officials claiming that 'unidentified news agencies' had distorted his remarks. The US and its allies suspect Iran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability. Tehran says its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes, but Israel regards it as a threat to its existence and refuses to rule out military action. With the election of an apparently more pragmatic president, it had been hoped Western countries might see a better chance for diplomacy and strike a deal to curb Iran’s uranium enrichment programme and avoid any conflict. Hitting out: Mr Rouhani allegedly described Israel as a 'wound' that needs to be removed from the Middle East . Rouhani's predecessor Ahmadinejad also addressed Israel on Qods Day in his last speech as president. He said: 'You planted wind in our region and you will reap the storm. I swear to God that a ferocious storm is coming and it will uproot the Zionist entity.' Earlier, the ‘Supreme Leader of Iran’, Ayatollah Ali Khameni issued a fatwa against the minority Baha’i community  - calling on Iranians to avoid Baha’is and labelling them a ‘deviant and misleading sect’. The edict illustrates that despite Rouhani’s  promises to rule with moderation and ensure the rights of religious minorities, ultimate power in Iran rests with the Supreme Leader.

The attractive young advertising executive who tragically fell from the balcony of her high-rise Manhattan apartment on Friday was leaning against a railing that was in desperate need of repair, law-enforcement officials say. Every balcony at the pre-war building Stonehenge 57 on East 57th Street, including the one that Jennifer Rosoff rested her leg against, was ‘deemed defective or not up to code,’ one law-enforcement official told the New York Post. ‘They weren’t strong enough to hold her up’ another law-enforcement source told the New York tabloid. All of the apartment balconies were defective or not up to code.’ The New York City Department of Buildings added that Rosoff's apartment complex was six months behind in filing a facade report and, as a result, may face a $1,500 fine. 'They needed to file the report by August 2012, but they filed it on Feb. 21, 2013,' a Buildings representative told the Post.

Rosoff went outside for a cigarette with her date, who she met online, at about 12.50am when the railing of the narrow balcony collapsed after she propped her leg on it to stretch, according to DNAinfo. When the volunteer charity worker's date told her that it wasn't safe to lean on the railing, she insisted she 'did it all the time' before tumbling from the Stonehedge 57 apartment ledge, landing on construction scaffolding on the first floor. A witness said the man was 'hysterical' as he ran outside screaming 'Oh my god!' Emergency crews pronounced Rosoff dead at the scene. A photo of the corner balcony of the apartment where Rosoff lived shows the top two railings bent down in a V-shape. Associated Press said the railings were made of metal, which witnesses claim were 'bent and twisted'. New York Post claims its sources revealed the date told police he heard two sharp pops before the railing collapsed. Police have cleared the man, who had met Rosoff in person for the first time that night, of any possible wrongdoing. DNAinfo reported the man's parents answered his apartment door and said he . was home, but declined to comment. Neighbors at the 400 East 57th Street building, near First Avenue in Manhattan's Midtown East, compared the sound of Rosoff's fall to a 'gunshot' and a 'punch'. Soda executive Steve Hersch, who lives two doors down from Rosoff, told DNAinfo: 'I heard a bang. I thought it was a gunshot.' Sara Shubert said: 'It sounded like a 200-pound punch.' Jennifer Rosoff, 35, plunged 17 floors to her death after the balcony railing gave way when she leaned on it . The two metal balcony railings on Rosoff's corner apartment were bent down in a V-shape . Rosoff's sister, Alexis Treeby, heard about her sister's tragic demise about 5am. 'She was a lovely person. My children adored her,' Treeby told DNAinfo. 'She was kind, generous and did charity work.' Buildings . officials took part of the broken railing to examine how it could have . buckled and plan to examine whether the other balconies are . structurally sound. Meanwhile the Department of Buildings issued a vacate order for the building's . balconies this morning, saying conditions there were 'imminently . perilous to life'. A department spokeswoman told New York Times that inspectors were investigating conditions and would report on their findings later today. However Daily News reported the building was cited for a construction violation on June 27, according to the Department of Buildings online records. Jennifer Rosoff, 35, has plunged to her death while on her first date after the railing on her 17th-floor New York City balcony gave way . Rosoff was the Director of Sales at Triplelift, a digital advertising firm in the Flatiron District, according to her Linkedin profile. Rosoff's tragic end has shattered her colleagues, who described her as 'highly-respected'. 'We are all deeply saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of our dear friend and co-worker,' TripleLift co-founder and CEO Eric Berry said in a statement, according to DNAinfo. 'She was well-loved and a highly-respected member of our team. Her tremendous energy and humor brought so much joy to the office. The entire company is distraught by the loss of Ms. Rosoff — she will be deeply missed.' Rosoff had previously worked at Lucky magazine and The New Yorker. Her Twitter account was updated shortly before her fatal fall.

Disgraced: Silvio Berlusconi launched a furious attack against the Italian justice system after a supreme court ruling which upheld a tax fraud conviction against the billionaire . Furious: The 76-year-old protested his innocence and accused magistrates of persecuting him since his entry into politics 20 years ago . The ruling, confirming a sentence for tax fraud involving inflated invoices at his Mediaset broadcasting empire, was the first definitive sentence he had received after dozens of previous trials on charges ranging from tax to sex offences. In a video message broadcast on Italian television after the verdict last night, he said: 'No one can understand the real violence which has been directed against me. 'A genuine campaign of aggression that has no equal.' Just three months after centre-left Prime Minister Enrico Letta took . office at the head of an uneasy coalition with Berlusconi's People of . Freedom party (PDL), Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy, is . again mired in uncertainty. Berlusconi is unlikely to have to serve any time in jail because of his age. The supreme court ordered part of the original sentence - imposing a ban on holding political office - to be reviewed. But the ruling has dealt an unprecedented blow to the man who has dominated Italian politics for two decades.

'This . sentence will not affect the Letta government, which was created to . serve the country and which will continue to serve it as far as we are . concerned,' former Justice Minister Nitto Palma said after a meeting in . Berlusconi's Rome residence.

Clean-up: A worker cleans green paint from the organ in the Bethlehem Chapel at the National Cathedral on Monday. The Chinese woman was arrested at the scene with a soda can containing green paint . Vandal: The woman appeared in D.C. Superior Court on alongside a Mandarin translator . Police and prosecutors also believe . she's connected to several acts of similar vandalism, including at the .

In another church near Thomas Circle, Tian allegedly splashed the organ with a mixture of white paint, feces and urine. D.C. police Chief Cathy L. Lanier told NewsChannel8 on Tuesday that the paint incidents are likely to be connected and that the woman may have 'mental health issues.' Authorities also said that Tian appears to speak very little English and her motives remain unclear. Green paint was discovered splattered onto the Lincoln Memorial early last Friday morning, and it was found later on a statue outside the Smithsonian headquarters on the National Mall, as reported by Wusa9.com. Target: The highly-popular Lincoln Memorial was splashed with paint . Gentle work: The green paint is carefully removed from the organ in the Washington National Cathedral's historic Bethlehem Chapel on Tuesday . Police said she had no fixed address but that she told officers she lived in Los Angeles. Following her arrest, a witness contacted police and reported that the woman had been seen attending a service at a church less than a block from Thomas Circle, according to court documents. The witness reported that the woman was carrying three bags with her. After she left, the witness found that a pipe organ in the church had been splattered with white paint, urine and feces, documents show. Tian was arrested inside the cathedral on Monday afternoon, shortly after the still-wet green paint was discovered there. When . a police officer approached her, she walked away and placed the soda . can with green paint inside one of three bags that were sitting on . chairs in the chapel. Turning green: The woman was arrested Monday on charges she vandalized two chapels at Washington, DC's National Cathedral with green paint.

Organizers of a new event planned for several U.S. cities plan to unleash bulls to sprint through fenced-in courses as daredevils try to avoid being trampled. The Great Bull Run is inspired by the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. It's set to kick off August 24 at a drag-racing strip south of Richmond, Virginia. A second event is planned for October 19 at an Atlanta-area horse park that hosted events for the 1996 Olympics. Give chase: One company is organizing running of the bulls events all over the U.S. to give Americans a taste for the Spanish tradition . Run wild: Great Bull Run events will be taking place later this month, and continue with one event almost every month . More events are planned later for Texas, Florida, California, Minnesota, Illinois and Pennsylvania. Bull runs - when the animals are released to run alongside participants as spectators cheer - are common in Spain and can drum up controversy. Injuries often occur, as do deaths, though they are much rarer. Some groups attack the treatment of the bulls used in the runs. About 5,000 people have signed up to participate in the Virginia event, and the number grows by about 50 each day, said Rob Dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of The Great Bull Run. And with 2,000 signed up for the Conyers, Georgia, event, Dickens expects 5,000 to 7,000 to run there in October. The U.S. events will last one day each, unlike the annual weeklong festival in Pamplona, when bull runs are held every morning. Author Ernest Hemingway wrote about the festival in his 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises, which helped it gain worldwide notoriety and attract spectators from around the globe. Organizers acknowledge that the Great Bull Run is likely to start out on a smaller scale than its Spanish counterpart. Spanish tradition: The Running of the Bulls happens every year at the Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona, Spain. Every morning bulls are released onto the street and brave men and women run to escape being gored . But they note that other physically challenging activities such as extreme off-road runs and obstacle races have become increasingly popular in the U.S., and they see bull running as a natural follow-up. 'I think it's just a progression where we are becoming more and more active as a society,' Dickens said. 'There's this fitness craze that started with running. I think this is just an extension of all that, but making it more interesting to the general public.' Dozens of people are injured each year in the San Fermin festival at Pamplona, most by tripping and falling. Bulls have killed 15 people since record-keeping began in 1924. Food fight: The bull running events will also be coupled with a tomato royale - another Spanish tradition of fighting in the streets with tomatoes . Last month in Spain, a University of Utah college student and an Australian woman were gored by bulls. During one run, participants and spectators screamed as a bull tossed a Spaniard to the ground and attacked him, with fellow runners trying to pull the animal away by its tail. The man was eventually dragged to safety. Organizers of the U.S. events plan to include several safety features, making them 'quite different than the running of the bulls in Spain,' Dickens said. Unlike the narrow, cobblestone streets of the Spanish runs, the U.S. events will use fencing that will include coves, or notches, so participants can get out of the way quickly. Safer: The American organizers are putting certain systems in place to make their events much safer than the running in Pamplona . Dickens said organizers are partnering with ranches who will supply the bulls, and veterinarians will monitor their health. 2013 . August 24: Petersburg, VA . October 19: Conyers, Georgia . December 7: Baytown, Texas . 2014 . February 1: Dade City, Florida . March 8: Lake Elsinore, California . April 5: Dallas, Texas . May 10: Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota . June 7: Mohnton, Pennsylvania . June 21: San Francisco, California . July 12: Cicero, Illinois . 'We're not using the Spanish fighting bulls that are bred to be very aggressive for the entertaining aspect of bullfighting,' Dickens said. Bulls will be released in waves of six at a time, giving the animals and people a 'better opportunity to complete the course safely,' Dickens said. Before running, participants will be required to sign waivers. Dickens, an attorney, acknowledges that waivers won't prevent lawsuits but likened it to sky-diving or operating a rock-climbing wall: 'The waivers for the most part ensure that even if you get sued, they're not going to win.' Researchers are still trying to figure out why some people are drawn to potentially dangerous activities. One theory is that some people get a surge from routine activities, but others need more thrilling or exciting behaviors to get the same feeling, said Dr. Jonathan Becker, assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. 'To get that same sort of euphoric feeling that you feel at the end of a jog, they may need to jog with bulls for example,' Becker said. Organizers say they're planning each of U.S. events as an all-day experience, with plenty of activities such as a tomato fight, also modeled after a Spanish festival. But they hope the bull runs draw participants who have always wanted to participate but couldn't make the trip to Spain. 'You can go running down the street anytime you want, but to run with bulls - that's something that doesn't come along very often,' Dickens said.","The Great Bull Run will happen at several U.S. cities starting August 24 in Richmond, Virginia .

Suspicious: Michele Catalano believes her family's Google searches caused a 'Joint Terrorism Task Force' to visit her house . A journalist living in Long Island was greatly mistaken when she published a blog post claiming that Google searches for ‘pressure cooker bombs’ and ’backpack’ had led police to her doorstep. As it turns out, the police tip-off came from the former employers of Michele Catalano’s husband Todd Pinnell. Suffolk County police explained Friday that ‘detectives received a tip from a Bay Shore-based computer company regarding suspicious computer searches conducted by a recently released employee.’ Pinnell, who worked as a product manager at New York-based Speco Technologies, apparently had been searching for the terms ‘pressure cooker bombs’ and ‘backpacks’ on his work computer when his former employers began to fear that they may have a terrorist in their midst. That recent revelation followed a major uproar among Internet users on Thursday after Catalano, a former contributor to Forbes, published her piece, which prompted many to quickly blame the NSA. Catalano published her account of what happened on the site Medium on Thursday, saying six plain-clothes cops showed up at her home, and proceeded to interview her husband about pressure cookers and search her house. She said she believes her 'news junkie' son reading articles on the Boston Bombings, coupled with her hunt for a pressure cooker and her husband's online shopping for a backpack created the 'perfect storm of terrorism profiling.' The FBI, Nassau County and Suffolk County Police Departments maintained that they had no invo9levement in the call. Though Catalano wasn't at home at the time, her husband Pinell was when three black SUVs drove up to their house and the cops exited and started to approach their property, flashing badges with handguns in their holsters. Pinell went outside to meet the men and complied with their request to look around the house and backyard. They walked around the living room, looked at books and pictures, and petted their dogs. When they asked to go into the son's room, her husband said he was sleeping and they left him alone. They also interviewed him, asking about where he was from, where his wife was, and if they had any bombs. They also asked about whether they owned a pressure cooker. Her husband said no, but that they had a rice cooker. 'Can you make a bomb with that?' they asked. He told them his wife used it to make quinoa. 'What the hell is quinoa?' they asked. What the hell is quinoa? After asking whether the family had a pressure cooker, Catalano's husband said they only have a rice cooker to cook quinoa. The officers were mystified by the ancient grain . Catalano said that 'by this point they realized they were not dealing with terrorists and the men wrapped their search up. Pinell called her immediately after, laughing about the incident, but Catalano didn't see the humor. She said she felt a 'great sense of anxiety' when she realized that 'this is where we are at.' 'Where you have no expectation of privacy. Where trying to learn how to cook some lentils could possibly land you on a terrorism watch list,' she wrote. The FBI confirmed the visit to The Guardian, but said their officers weren't involved. A spokesman said it was Nassau County Police officers working in conjunction with the Suffolk County Police Department. But a Nassau County police spokesman told MailOnline they weren't involved. 'We did not, did not, go out to this woman's home,' police spokesman James Imperiale said. 'What agency went I couldn't tell you. I don't know.' A Suffolk County Police spokesman referred media back to the FBI. If the search were truly carried out due to suspicious Google searches, it would have required a warrant. In a company report on transparency, Google detailed how they deal with law enforcement officials looking for evidence online. 'The . government needs legal process—such as a subpoena, court order or . search warrant—to force Google to disclose user information. Exceptions . can be made in certain emergency cases, though even then the government . can’t force Google to disclose.' Which has led some to question the validity of Ms Catalano's story. Today, she took to Twitter, writing that she wasn't giving interviews to the media. 'I'll say it once: I didn't make it up,' she wrote. 'Thanks to those defending my integrity.' On Friday, Catalano sang a different tune. Her story update on Medium read: . 'We found out through the Suffolk Police Department that the searches involved also things my husband looked up at his old job. We were not made aware of this at the time of questioning and were led to believe it was solely from searches from within our house. 'I did not lie or make it up. I wrote the piece with the information that was given. What was withheld from us obviously could not be a part of a story I wrote based on what happened yesterday. 'The piece I wrote was the story as we knew it with the information we were told. None of it was fabricated. If you know me, you know I would never do that. 'If it was misleading, just know that my intention was the truth. And that was what I knew as the truth until about ten minutes ago. That there were other circumstances involved was something we all were unaware of.'","Michele Catalano, a former writer for Forbes, published an account of the raid today .

Foreign Secretary William Hague told of his 'grave concerns' over how the Zimbabwean election was conducted after it was confirmed Robert Mugabe has won another five-year presidential term. Zimbabwe election officials said this afternoon that Mugabe, 89, won the presidential election with 61 per cent of the vote, compared to 33 per cent for challenger Morgan Tsvangirai. The result infuriated Tsvangirai, who claimed the election had been stolen by Mugabe's Zanu-PF and claimed it was a ‘huge farce’ and ‘null and void’. He said the result had plunged the country into a constitutional crisis, saying his MDC party would no longer deal with Zanu-PF. His party vowed to ‘exhaust all legal remedies’ to overturn Mugabe’s landslide  victory and claimed that electoral rolls contained thousands of fake names and that many MDC voters had been prevented from registering.

Hague this evening also expressed concern over the election, . which has been plagued by claims of widespread fraud and vote-rigging. In a statement released by the Foreign . Office, Mr Hague said: 'People around the world are watching events in . Zimbabwe, following the announcement by the Zimbabwean Electoral . Commission that President Mugabe has won the presidential elections, as . well as the indications of possible legal challenges. 'I commend the people of Zimbabwe on . holding peaceful elections. However we have grave concerns over the . conduct of the election. 'The preliminary statements of the .

Responding to Tsvangirai’s claims, Zanu-PF spokesman  Patrick Chinamasa said : ‘My plea to him is to have recourse in the courts. ‘He should feel free to employ the best lawyers.’ Tsvangirai's party said yesterday it . has had calls from supporters to take to the streets in protest and was . assessing reports that Mugabe's loyalist military and police were . planning a clampdown and arrests of its party leaders. The . Movement for Democratic Change said Friday it rejected the observations . of African monitors that glossed over 'monumental fraud' by state . security agents and Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. The mood in some urban . strongholds of the MDC was muted. But the African Union dismissed complaints of fraud, while another observer urged all parties to ‘accept hard facts’. The 89-year-old president has been Zimbabwe’s ruler since independence from Britain in 1980. Olusegan Obasanjo, head of the African Mission, admitted there were ‘incidents which could have been avoided’ but said these would not have altered the overall outcome of the poll. He said his monitors noted some apparent irregularities but that they did not constitute evidence of systematic tampering.

Wednesday's contentious vote has created fresh uncertainty in a country long afflicted by division and economic turmoil. ‘Yes, the election is free,’ Obasanjo said. He described the vote as credible unless any evidence to the contrary emerges, and asked election authorities to investigate reports that tens of thousands of eligible voters were turned away. Another poll monitoring group in Zimbabwe said as many as 1 million of the more than 6 million eligible voters were prevented from casting ballots. ‘If 25 per cent were not allowed, then, yes, the election is fatally flawed,’ said Obasanjo, a former Nigerian president. The head of the observer mission for the Southern African Development Community, a regional body, described the election Wednesday as ‘very free’ and ‘very peaceful’. But, he noted that there were some violations and a full analysis was still under way. It was too early to describe the vote as ‘fair’, he said . Tanzania's foreign minister  Bernard Membe  said: ‘The question of fairness is broad and you cannot answer it within one day. ‘And so be sure that within 30 days, through our main report, the question of fairness may come.’ Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe's main opponent in the presidential vote, has declared the election ‘null and void.’ Mugabe's ZANU-PF party said Friday that poll returns showed that 3.9 million voters cast their ballots on Wednesday. Queue: Voters in the suburbs of Harare line up to have their say in the crunch election . Opponent: Prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai, pictured with his wife Elizabeth, was vying to be president . That 61 percent turnout was higher than in an uncontested referendum on a new constitution in March where no disputed voters' lists were used and only national citizens' identity documents were needed. Mugabe's Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa said Friday his party was ‘headed for an unprecedented landslide.’ ‘If anyone is dissatisfied, the courts are there. I invite Tsvangirai to go to court if he has any grounds to justify what he has been saying,’ Chinamasa told reporters. Under the law, seven days were set aside for legal challenges, with another two days for rulings to be made and then the swearing in of a new government takes place. Obasanjo said voting itself was peaceful but the observers noted ‘incidences that could have been avoided and even tended to have breached the law.’ Support: Hundreds of MDC members at a rally in Harare ahead of the election . Dedication: Many voters had wrapped up warm in woollen clothes to protect themselves against cold weather . Long-serving: Mugabe, now 89, has been in power for 33 years and is the country's only ever black leader . Independent election monitors have alleged many people were unable to vote because of disorganized voters' lists and a chaotic program to register electors on those lists in the run-up to polling day. Obasanjo said some apparent irregularities were made in error largely after funding for the vote was late in coming from the nation's depleted state coffers. ‘I have never seen an election that is perfect,’ he said. ‘The process continues and we have to limit our comments.’ Aisha Abdullahi, the African Union's commissioner for political affairs, said observers reported that Zimbabwe had made improvements in the conduct of elections since the last violent and disputed elections in 2008 that led regional leaders to forge a shaky coalition between Mugabe and Tsvangirai, the former opposition leader. Celebration: MDC voters had been optimistic that Tsvangirai would finally be able to take power . Ballot paper: An electoral official holds up the ballot showing all five presidential candidates . Patient: Zimbabweans have overcome obstacles to travel to the polling stations and cast their votes . Democracy: Officials explain to an elderly voter how to cast a vote at a suburban polling station . Moment of truth: Elderly voters place their ballot in the election . But she said they expressed ‘grave concerns’ over voters' lists this time that were not made available in time for inspection and verification by voters, contesting parties and candidates. Public scrutiny of the voters' roll was of vital ‘strategic importance’ to verify the accuracy of the contents and establish correct numbers of eligible electors, she said. She said the electoral commission printed 8.7 million ballot papers for 6.4 million voters, or 35 per cent above the number of registered voters against the international standard of 5 to 10 per cent. Observers said a significant number of ballot booklets had missing ballot papers and papers without serial numbers. They also expressed ‘great concern’ over the high numbers of voters turned away. The late publicity on the location of voting stations just 48 hours before stations opened contributed also to voters who failed to cast ballots because they were not at correct polling sites. Abdullahi said observers reported a high number of disabled, elderly or other ‘assisted voters’ being helped to cast their ballots by polling officers who may have influenced them against their free will. In some outlying stations, one-quarter of voters were helped this way. She said some AU observers are to remain in Zimbabwe until August 14.","89-year-old Robert Mugabe wins another five-year presidential term .

Sir Ian Andrews had blocked the release of the names as Soca is considering investigating allegations . The names of blue-chip firms which hired rogue private eyes are likely to remain secret despite the resignation of a senior police figure. After the chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) stepped down on Thursday, hopes were raised that the controversial list of 102 companies and individuals that it had compiled could soon be revealed. Sir Ian Andrews had blocked the release of the names as Soca is considering investigating allegations that the firms used private investigators who broke the law to obtain sensitive information. However, last night sources dashed any hopes that his decision to step down over a conflict of interest could soften the crime-fighting agency’s position on the list. One said: ‘The very good reasons that it must not be made public remain exactly the same. Nothing has changed.’ Angry MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee, who have been given the list, are desperately hunting for a way to legitimately publish it without undermining any potential prosecutions. They believe the firms on it have escaped scrutiny for hiring dodgy private investigators who hacked, blagged and stole private data. And they are suspicious of claims by Soca director general Trevor Pearce that the list may still be used in ‘live’ cases as it was compiled before 2008. Last week Home Secretary Theresa May announced that the private investigation industry will be regulated . It is understood that Keith Bristow, who will lead the National Crime Agency when it takes over from Soca in October, is unlikely to overrule his predecessors. The list of 102 companies was handed to the select committee on the condition it is kept in a locked safe on secure premises. However, members have revealed the list is dominated by law firms, while others on it include debt collectors, oil companies, venture capitalists, pharmaceutical firms and two celebrities. Yesterday, a jailed private investigator revealed that his biggest clients were insurers at Lloyd’s of London. John Spears, 73, a former Met detective, was one of four rogue snoopers whose customers form the basis of the secret list. He said that he was employed by three international law firms based in the City, which were in turn working for underwriters on the Lloyd’s market, and that he would regularly be asked to carry out ‘financial investigations’ to assess the value of individuals and companies. Mr Pearce and others are due to answer further questions on the row next month when MPs return from their summer break. Last week Home Secretary Theresa May announced that the private investigation industry will be regulated, and that operating without a licence will be punishable with a six-month jail term and a £5,000 fine.","Was hoped the controversial list of 102 companies may be revealed .

Eight years ago our marriage went through a rough patch and I had a brief affair and confided in her. She didn’t tell my husband, but she’s taken to dropping hints ('our secret' sort of thing) in front of him and I’m beginning to feel emotionally blackmailed. Worse, she’s now divorced and keeps flirting with my spouse, whom she’s always fancied. What do I do? Will she tell? She had an affair and told her husband's best female friend but now feels emotionally blackmailed . ANSWER: Well, you’ve learnt a lesson the hard way: when you choose a confidante for tales of marital infidelity, pick someone who owes more loyalty to you than your spouse. Yes, she was your friend, too, but only after she’d known your husband for years. Those early alliances are formative and go deeper than you think. I have watched people separate after decades together, believing they will stay in touch with all their spouse’s good friends. It’s sadly true that some women are possessive of their male friends and are never totally reconciled to their choice of wife. Clearly this woman falls into that category. It’s possible she always envied you and your marriage, and was waiting for you to make a mistake. If her own marriage has proved unhappy and ended badly, she’s likely to feel you don’t deserve your ‘unsuspecting’ husband. Whatever the truth of her motivation, she is reminding you in the starkest way that she has a strong hold over you. If you want to erase the power of  this woman, confess the affair to your husband. Then tell him you deeply regret what happened and love him more than anyone on  the planet. I admit, however, it’s a high-risk strategy, especially if your husband is a jealous, insecure or volatile type. Having said that, my observation is that good marriages, with solid foundations, are usually able to withstand one foolish indiscretion — particularly if the person who strayed is truly remorseful. Alternatively, you could just crouch down and prepare to ride this one out. Tackling this female 'friend' is only likely to make her feel more resentful and hostile, in which case it’s worth sitting her down and saying to her that you made a huge mistake, you regret it every day of your life, but you’d like to draw a line under things.","My husband's best female friend became a close pal of mine too .

Whistleblower: A copy of a temporary document to allow Edward Snowden to cross the border into Russia . The US government gave Britain’s spying centre at GCHQ £100million over three years and apparently expected to influence its work, it was claimed last night. In return for the secret payments, the eavesdropping agency was expected to ‘pull its weight’, according to documents leaked last night by the fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden. One document states that weaker regulation for British spies than American agents is one of the intelligence services’ ‘selling points’ for the US. The leaked papers will raise more questions for the spy agency and ministers who oversee it, over the extent to which the US makes demands of Britain in its intelligence-gathering activities. In a document from 2010, GCHQ said the US National Security Agency had ‘raised a number of issues with regards to meeting [its] minimum expectations’, and GCHQ ‘remains short of the full NSA ask’. A cache leaked to The Guardian reveals the UK’s biggest fear is that ‘US perceptions of the … partnership diminish, leading to loss of access, and/or reduction in investment … to the UK’. The information is the latest to be leaked by Mr Snowden, a former NSA contractor who was charged with espionage in the US. He left Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport yesterday where he has been since late June after exposing Prism – a US intelligence project to snoop on Facebook accounts, emails and phone calls. Claim: The US government gave Britain's spying centre at GCHQ (pictured) £100million over three years and apparently expected to influence its work, it was alleged . GCHQ was criticised after he claimed British spies used the Prism system to bypass UK laws. Last week Parliament’s spy watchdog called for an investigation into the laws on intelligence eavesdropping, saying they may not be fit for purpose. The latest documents reveal the NSA gave GCHQ £22.9million in 2009, £39.9million in 2010, and another £34.7m in 2011-12. The 2010 payment included £4million to support GCHQ’s work for Nato forces in Afghanistan, and £17.2million to fund the agency’s Mastering the Internet project, which gathers and stores vast amounts of ‘raw’ information ready for analysis. Fugitive former US spy Edward Snowden was granted refugee status in Russia yesterday amid Western concerns he is now in the embrace of Moscow’s secret services. The 30-year-old intelligence leaker was accompanied by his British handler Sarah Harrison as he left Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport in a taxi. Miss Harrison, an ex-lover of WikiLeaks boss Julian Assange, has been at Mr Snowden’s side in the airport’s transit area for almost six weeks. The granting of refugee status pending his application for temporary political asylum is certain to spark fury in Washington which had urged President Putin to deport him to the US to face espionage charges. Also funded by the NSA was redevelopment of GCHQ’s sister site in Bude, Cornwall, to the tune of £15.5million. The site intercepts transatlantic cables that carry internet traffic. In return, the documents suggest GCHQ has to take the American view into account when deciding what to prioritise. The money has been an important source of income for the British agency as it has been forced to cut costs and has shed more than 300 of its 6,000 staff. Documents seen by the newspaper show GCHQ is heavily investing in harvesting personal information from mobile phones and apps, and wants to be able to ‘exploit any phone, anywhere, anytime’. But some GCHQ staff expressed concern about ‘the morality and ethics of their operational work, particularly given the level of deception involved’. A UK Government paper setting out GCHQ’s view after the 2010 strategic defence and security review says: ‘Our key partnership is with the US … GCHQ must pull its weight and be seen to pull its weight.’ A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘In a 60-year alliance it is entirely unsurprising that there are joint projects … but the benefits flow in both directions.’ Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: 'The vital work of the intelligence agencies requires effective and thorough oversight by the Intelligence and Security Committee on behalf of Parliament, and by ministers, and in the case of GCHQ, by the Foreign Secretary. 'The latest reports in the Guardian only underline the importance of the Foreign Secretary and the Intelligence and Security Committee being able to assure the public that the legal framework within which our intelligence agencies operate is both being adhered to and is fit for purpose.'","US gave GCHQ money and in return allowed to influence its work .

Businessman John Henry, the principal owner of the Boston Red Sox, has entered into an agreement to buy The Boston Globe for $70million, a massive drop from its record $1.1billion price two decades ago. The impending purchase from The New York Times Co. marks Henry's 'first foray into the financially unsettled world of the news media,' the Globe said Saturday. The deal will give Henry the 141-year-old newspaper, its websites and affiliated companies, it said. Sold: John Henry is acquiring The Boston Globe from The New York Times for $70million - less than 7 per cent of what the Times paid for the New England newspaper in 1993 . Henry cited the 'essential role that its journalists and employees play in Boston, throughout New England, and beyond.' 'The . Boston Globe's award-winning journalism as well as its rich history and . tradition of excellence have established it as one of the most well . respected media companies in the country,' Henry said in a statement. Henry, . who also owns the English Premier League soccer club Liverpool F.C., . said he would reveal details about his plans for the Globe in the next . few days. The Times announced in February it was putting the Globe and related assets up for sale four years after calling off a previous attempt to sell it. The company's CEO said at the time selling the Globe would help the company focus attention on The New York Times brand. Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy confirmed the planned sale of the Globe and other media properties to Henry. The Times said the all-cash sale, expected to close in 30 to 60 days, includes BostonGlobe.com, Boston.com, The Worcester Telegram & Gazette, Telegram.com, the direct mail marketing company Globe Direct and the company's 49 percent interest in Metro Boston, a free daily newspaper for commuters. Under new management: Henry is also the owner of the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool F.C. Globe editor Brian McGrory said the newspaper's Red Sox coverage and its editorial decisions won't be affected by the sale. 'We have no plans whatsoever to change our Red Sox coverage specifically, or our sports coverage in general, nor will we be asked,' McGrory told the newspaper. 'The Globe's sports reporting and commentary is the gold standard in the industry.' The Times bought the Globe from the family of former Globe executive Stephen Taylor in 1993 for what it said was the highest price paid for an American newspaper. The price Henry is paying is less than 7 per cent of the 1993 price. The Globe and other newspapers have faced difficulties in recent years as readers have fled to the Internet and advertisers have cut spending on newspapers and moved more ads online. Still, the Globe is a journalistic institution in New England and was lauded for its coverage of the deadly Boston Marathon bombings in April. A 2009 round of cost-cutting, involving pay cuts, helped put the Globe on better financial footing and prompted the Times to call off a planned sale. The future: Henry said he would announce his plans for the Globe in the coming days . In late 2011, the Globe started charging for access to its online version at BostonGlobe.com, which helped to boost circulation revenues. The Times company doesn't separate Globe revenue from The New York Times revenue in its financial statements. But the Globe had an average weekday circulation of 230,351 in the six months through September, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. The newspaper's increase in digital subscriptions more than offset declines in print. But the total is still down significantly from the nearly 413,000 it boasted in September 2002. The Globe isn't the only newspaper to see a huge drop in its price at sale time. In April 2012, Philadelphia's two largest newspapers sold for $55million, a fraction of the $515million paid by a group of investors in 2006.","The New York Times Co. put the New England newspaper on the market in February .

The mother of a two-year-old boy has been left shaken after a Walmart customer knocked a pink headband off the head of her son and called him a f****t. Katie Vyktoriah claims that her son was verbally and physically abused after she stopped off at the Florida store with her two children on Thursday night. Her oldest child Dexter, who loves to dress up - from superhero costumes to sparkly outfits - was wearing his mother's lace flower headband which he had been playing with earlier in the day. Playtime: After playing dressing up at home, Dexter was still wearing a pink headband belonging to his mother when they went to Walmart . Ms Vyktoriah was at the check out when a large man with a beard, and wearing tattered shorts and a camouflage shirt, yelled out: 'That's a boy?', according to the Huffington Post. He then grabbed the headband and threw it to the bottom of the shopping cart before cuffing Dexter lightly around the side of his head and saying with a laugh: 'You'll thank me later, little man!' In her shock and anger that a stranger had touched her child, Ms Vyktoriah told the man: 'If you touch my son again, I will cut your damn hands off.' The 31-year-old claimed the man then looked at her child in disgust and said: 'Your son is a f****** f****t. He'll get shot for it one day.' After the man left, the mother-of-two said no staff or customers came to her assistance as she started to shake while comforting Dexter. Before the incident, her son had been confidently waving at customers from the seat in his trolley, 'charming all the old ladies by waving like a little pageant prince'. Family: Katie Vyktoriah and Mark Reed, with their son Dexter and baby son . Protective: Katie Vyktoriah was left shaken after a man called her two-year-old son a f****t . In her blog, A Mother Thing, Mrs Vyktoriah said two older women had even come up to tell her how adorable her son was. She said that while the 'cuff' the man gave her son was light, she objected to a stranger touching her child, and trying to impose his views on Dexter and making assumptions. Ms Vyktoriah added that at two-years-old her son does not have a sexuality. He was just a boy who had been playing. She added: 'Even if being gay is a lifestyle choice . (which I don't believe for a second), it is not a choice that a toddler . can ever make. And much like little girls can play baseball or enjoy . monster trucks, little boys can and do play dress up with mommy's . clothes ...

Since writing about the incident on her blog, the mother-of-two has been inundated with comments - some supportive, others criticizing her parenting skills. Despite many people suggesting that she makes an official complaint, and advising her to check if the incident was caught on the store's surveillance cameras, Ms Vyktoriah has decided not to pursue the matter. She said the experience has made her reflect on the world in which her children are growing up, adding: 'While we may accept and support whoever . our kids turn out to be, I am scared beyond words at what it would mean . for them if they are gay. Why should anyone have to live in fear because . they fall in love with someone that you or someone else doesn't agree . with.'","Stranger gave child a gentle cuff and said he would thank him one day .

Accused: Daniel Bartelt, 19, has been charged with murdering his ex-girlfriend and attacking another woman with a knife last month . A 19-year-old man has been charged with killing his former high school girlfriend by strangling her in her bed, and attacking another woman three days earlier. Daniel Joseph Bartelt is accused of murdering 19-year-old actress Jessie Blodgett after she returned to her Hartford, Wisconsin, home from a 'Fiddler on the Roof' cast party on July 15. The college dropout also confessed to attacking a woman with a knife in a park on July 12, saying it was a 'spur of the moment decision', just hours after researching serial killers online. In court on Wednesday, Bartelt's lawyer Gary Schmaus said the teenager was mentally unfit to stand trial and needed to be 'evaluated as soon as possible', according to ABC News. Police affidavits in the criminal complaint and probable cause documents say Bartelt denied killing Blodgett. However Huffington Post reports Bartelt's fingerprints were found on a wad of of electrical tape underneath the floorboard of Blodgett's bedroom, leading to his arrest. Investigators say he sneaked into Blodgett's house, tied her up and strangled her. The teen had marks on her neck and a preliminary autopsy ruled the cause of death as 'ligature strangulation'. Blodgett, a University of Wisconsin student, returned home from the party about 1am, and her mother found her dead in her bed later that day. Victim: The mother of Jessie Blodgett, 19, found her dead in her bed . Devastating: University of Wisconsin student and actress Jessie Blodgett was killed after returning home from a 'Fiddler on the Roof' cast party last month . Bartelt and Blodgett dated in high school, acted together in theater productions and even recorded a duet which they posted to YouTube. The pair recently began rekindling a friendship, but  Huffington Post reports Bartelt wanted to be more than friends. Just three days before Blodgett's death, Bartelt attacked a woman with a knife at Richfield Historical Nature Park, according to new documents released by prosecutors. He tackled her to the ground before the woman, who believed she was 'going to die', wrestled the knife from Bartelt, according to Fox 6 News. The documents also revealed Bartlet asked her if he could leave - she said no. Still holding the knife, the woman drove away in her car. She reportedly needed 15 stitches to her hand. Police said Bartelt admitted to the attack, calling it 'a spur of the moment decision…to scare her.' Former lovers: Daniel Bartelt, pictured, used to date Jessie Blodgett, and the duo recorded a demo which they uploaded to YouTube . The . documents also outlined disturbing internet searches Bartelt allegedly performed on his laptop just 30 minutes before the park attack. Fox 6 News said he searched for the body counts of famous . killers, 'spree killing,' and the Wikipedia entries for two high-profile . strangulation cases - Columbian Louis Garavito, known for dismembering his victims, and South African Moses Sithole, who lured victims to secluded places before raping and killing them. Bartelt’s parents allegedly told officials he had dropped out of college at UW-Stevens Point after a semester, and had returned home appearing depressed, according to Fox 6 News. However in court this week, Bartelt's lawyer Schmaus said the crimes the teenager has been accused of don't 'make sense'. 'When you hear about Daniel's life and achievements and education and . intelligence and all of the different positive things he's been involved . with up until now, it doesn't seem to blend or make sense,' Schmaus . said. Unsound mind? In court on Wednesday, Daniel Bartelt's attorney argued that the 19-year-old is mentally unfit to stand trial for allegedly killing Jessie Blodgett . Fox 6 News reports this week's court hearing was halted when Schmaus raised concerns . about his client's competence to understand the proceedings. A . competency evaluation will be performed by the Department of Health .

It’s not just the gut that benefits from friendly bacteria, a person’s more intimate regions do too - and condoms have been found to boost levels in women’s vaginas. A study has revealed that sexually active women who used condoms have greater quantities of beneficial bacteria called Lactobacillus compared to other forms of contraception. Possessing healthy levels of the bacteria in that part of the body is associated with a lower incidence of itchiness and even a lower chance of being infected with HIV. A study has revealed that sexually active women who used condoms have greater quantities of beneficial bacteria called lactobacillus compared to other forms of contraception. Possessing healthy levels is associated with a lower incidence of itchiness and even a smaller chance of being infected with HIV . Researchers at Beijing Friendship Hospital studied 164 healthy, married women in China, aged between 18 and 45 who were not using a hormonal form of birth control, according to a report by LiveScience. Among the participants, 72 were using condoms, 57 were using an intrauterine device (IUD), and 35 were using the 'rhythm method', in which a couple abstains from sex on the days pregnancy is mostly likely. The scientists focused on lactobacillus, a group of bacteria that dominates the natural flora of the vagina for many women. The . microbes, which produce lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, help the . vagina maintain an average pH of 4.5, similarto the acidity of beer . or tomato juice. This 'acidic buffer system', as the researchers called . it, is thought to block harmful bacteria from taking up residence and . causing infections. Lactobacillus (pictured) produce lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, help the vagina maintain an average pH of 4.5, comparable to the acidity of beer or tomato juice . Though . there may not be a 'normal' microbiome for a healthy vagina, the . presence of lactobacillus is thought to help prevent bacterial . vaginosis, which is an imbalance of vaginal bacteria that causes . itching, unusual discharge and unpleasant smell. Beneficial bacteria have even been linked to a decreased risk of HIV infection. The researchers found that the population of lactobacillus was significantly higher in the condom group. Sexual activity can disrupt the balance of the vagina's ecosystem, especially when semen (which has a pH of 7.0 to 8.0) enters the mix, the researchers said. The results suggest that condoms can help the vagina maintain its natural acidic defenses, the researchers said. However, the researchers warned that condoms might not be the best way to prevent unwanted pregnancy for everyone. Condoms have a failure rate of 15 per cent with 'average use', which takes into account human errors in using them. In contrast, IUDs have a failure rate of 0.6 percent to 0.8 percent in the first year, and can be effective for more than a decade after insertion, the researchers said. The new study was published in the journal PLOS One.","Lactobacillus are bacteria that dominate the natural flora of the vagina .

Each 'cigarette' comes in high (12mg) or medium (8mg) nicotine dosage. Because stock is limited, customers will only be able to buy a maximum of 12 e-cigarettes each. The e-cigarette industry is facing tighter regulation after research found that there is little quality control exercised among manufacturers. Around 1.3million Britons use battery-powered e-cigarettes, which turn nicotine into vapour to be inhaled, avoiding the harm caused by tobacco smoke. Last month the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency decided they must be regulated, like drugs, to make them ‘safer and more effective’. Its research had found that nicotine levels delivered often differed from the amount stated on the label and varied from batch to batch. Other studies have suggested that some e-cigarettes contain potentially harmful contaminants, the MHRA said, and there were anecdotal reports of a user suffering facial burns after one exploded. Although using e-cigarettes is safer than smoking tobacco ‘the long-term safety of these components to the consumer remains unknown’, it said. The Ezi-Cig quitting aid (pictured) is the cheapest disposable e-cigarette to go on sale. It is thought around 1.3 million smokers and ex-tobacco users in the UK use an electronic cigarette - and experts say the figure can only increase .

The product will also go on sale in over 40 Poundworld shops in September. In the UK, 25 per cent of all attempts to kick the habit are made using e-cigarettes, making it the most popular quitting aid.

The UK's medicines regulatory body MHRA is forecasting that e-cigarettes like Ezi-Cig (pictured) could help save 57,000 British lives over the next decade . E-cigarettes are designed to imitate smoking behaviour without the use of tobacco and contain no tar, no 'second hand' smoke, ash or odour. A rechargeable version of the Ezi-Cig has also gone on sale with ten cartridges, priced at £4.99. The company said that similar sets often set smokers back around £20. Naomi . Bitcliffe, 27, a smoker from Leeds who has tested the Ezi-Cig said: . 'It's a bit heavier to hold than a normal cigarette but it tastes a lot . cleaner. 'I haven't . bothered buying one in the past because they are too expensive but . priced at £1 - I'll definitely use them to try and cut down. 'It's good to have something to hold and mimicking the action puts you off wanting to light up for real.' Amanda . Sandford, research manager for ASH (Action on Smoking and Health), said: . 'If smokers wish to try e-cigarettes as a way of cutting down or . quitting smoking then these products could be attractive since they are . cheap and don't involve a big financial outlay.

'However, . we would advise people who want to stop smoking to speak to their . doctor or pharmacist and use licensed nicotine replacement products as . these have a proven track record as effective aids to quitting.' An MHRA spokesman said: 'We cannot comment on price...and without seeing the product we could not comment on the quality. 'Our research has shown that existing electronic cigarettes and other nicotine containing products on the market are not good enough to meet this public health priority.' Some 'nicotine containing products' are already licensed, and the government is working towards licensing for all these products. The MHRA spokesman said: 'It's not about banning products that some people find useful. 'It's about making sure that smokers have an effective alternative that they can rely on to meet their needs.'","Electronic cigarette Ezi-Cig goes on sale at Discount UK stores today .

"By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED: . 12:00 EST, 30 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:43 EST, 31 July 2013 . More than a billion prescriptions are being written by Britain’s doctors every year. Record numbers taking painkillers, sleeping pills, antidepressants and medication for heart disease and diabetes have helped the figure soar by two thirds in a decade. More than 2.7 million prescriptions are being written out each day – equivalent to more than 1,900 every minute, according to NHS data. Just over a decade ago 617million prescriptions a year were being written. For every person in England, an average of 18.7 prescription items were dispensed in 2012, compared to 17.1 in 2009 and 12.4 in 2002. The most costly condition was diabetes, which accounted for £768 million last year - up 2.2 per cent (£16.2 million) on 2011 . There are concerns that the rise has in part been fuelled by GPs handing out drugs such as painkillers and sleeping pills too readily, with many patients quickly becoming addicted. Meanwhile, campaigners blamed the increase in antidepressants on rising levels of stress, possibly due to the economic woes. The numbers of prescriptions for the drugs including Prozac and Seroxat jumped 7.5 per cent last year, up from 47million to 50million. The most commonly taken drugs are statins – to lower cholesterol – aspirin, paracetamol, indigestion relief, high blood pressure treatments and medication for thyroid problems, which affect metabolism. The most expensive condition to treat is diabetes – which accounted for £768million last year, up 2.2 per cent on 2011. Overall, the cost of prescriptions to the NHS was £8.5billion in 2012, which is similar to the total cost in 2009. It was £6.8billion in 2002. For every person in England, an average of 18.7 prescription items were dispensed, compared with 17.1 in 2009 and 12.4 in 2002. The latest data show that in 2012, 43.3 million antibiotics were dispensed - a rise of 2.5 million in just one year . That's 19 for every Briton . The NHS’s Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), which provided the figures, said the rise was partly driven by the increasing population and higher numbers of elderly who are more likely to fall ill. But although the numbers of prescriptions is rising, the actual cost has remained the same as the price of many drugs has fallen. The data shows nine out of 10 prescription items were dispensed free of charge, with about 60 per cent going to people aged 60 and over. Dr Andrew McCulloch, of the Mental Health Foundation, said: ‘This further rise in antidepressant prescribing is very worrying given massive Government investment in psychotherapy and the development of other alternative treatments for depression. The soaring numbers of patients being diagnosed with diabetes, in part been driven by rising obesity rates, will also have contributed to the rise in prescriptions. The total cost to the NHS of drugs and other medicinal items has been at a virtual standstill for three years, thanks partly to more branded drugs losing patent protection and being replaced by cheaper generics . Robin Hewings, of Diabetes UK, said: ‘These prescriptions help people with diabetes to stay alive and to manage their condition so that their diabetes does not result in serious complications, such as foot amputation and blindness. As well as having a huge personal cost, these complications are extremely expensive.’ A total of 2.9million Britons have the condition – twice as many as 1996 – of whom 90 per cent have type 2, which can be triggered by obesity. Earlier this week Home Secretary Theresa May said she had recently been diagnosed with Type 1, which is normally spotted in childhood. Kingsley Manning, of HSCIC, said: ‘For the first time, one billion prescription medicines have been dispensed to our communities in just one year. ‘This figure reflects a continuing upward trend in prescription numbers, which is in contrast to a recent fall in total net cost. ‘Total costs have fallen for the second year running and are now at 2009 levels. ‘Our report shows that while  people on average now receive more prescription items, the cost of these per head has dropped in the last two years.’ The cost per head of the population increased from £137.80 in 2002 to £159.33 in 2012. It peaked at £167.80 in 2010.","The number of medicines prescribed to Britons has topped one billion .

The Rivers Nursery Orchard near Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, is the Holy Grail for fruit-tree enthusiasts. The oldest nursery in Britain, it was founded in 1725 by a genius of the fruit world, John Rivers. And his descendant, Thomas Rivers, developed the Conference Pear at, yes, a pear conference in the late 19th century. Native: Many British orchards have disappeared, drastically reducing our own home-grown varieties . Next month, an international group of horticulturalists and fruit experts will make a pilgrimage to the orchard to pay homage to the Rivers family, who perfected the art of fruit breeding. In his day, Thomas Rivers bred more than 75 new varieties of apple, peach, nectarine, plum, cherry, apricot and pear. Sadly, the site the green-fingered visitors will see won’t be as magnificent as it once was. As late as 1950, there were 300 acres of orchard here, crammed with 11,000 apple trees, 6,000 pear trees and 5,000 plum trees. But in 1985, the site was sold for development and the vast majority of the orchards was dug up. These days, the Rivers Nursery Orchard is a fragment of its former self. It is down to under five acres and 700 trees, cultivated by an admirable band of local volunteers. This orchard’s story is the story of all Britain’s orchards. Since World War II, two-thirds of our orchards have been dug up. And, as those orchards have disappeared, so has our taste for apples — particularly our own home-grown varieties, many of them first bred here in Sawbridgeworth. Overall consumption of fruit has . declined in these junk-food-obsessed times — but it is the apple that . has particularly suffered. According to a new survey by market research . firm Kantar, sales of apples have fallen by 6.3 per cent over the last . year. Decline: Sales of apples across the varieties have fallen by 6.3¿per cent over the last year . As British-bred varieties have slumped in popularity, foreign apples have thrived. Cox’s are in decline while Gala and Braeburn — developed in New Zealand — are booming. Old varieties are losing out to new ones that are being aggressively branded and marketed. Britain’s fourth most popular apple, Pink Lady, is even trademarked, meaning British farmers aren’t allowed to grow it. Last year, a new brand, Joya, was advertised as though it were some kind of power snack, with the blurb: ‘Perfect for teens on the move or into sports.’ Yet overall apple consumption among the young is in decline. While the over-75s eat an average 195g of apple a week, the under-30s consume only 100g. In a bid to revive the flagging market, English Apples and Pears, the trade association for the fruit growers, is targeting immigrants to Britain, who tend not to be apple eaters, and encouraging them to make novel apple dishes, such as Indian lamb dhansak and Polish apple cake. They advise using Bramley apples, another variety in decline. Assistant chairman of the Rivers Nursery Site and Orchard Group, Joseph Fitzgerald, 58, says: ‘The disappearance of orchards from Britain has been slow year-on-year since the war, but the overall effect is seismic. ‘With the decline of the Empire after . the war, we stopped shipping out apples and started shipping in cheaper . ones. And you can’t go back — once you’ve dug up an orchard, it’s gone . for good. You’ve lost that link between the landscape and people, . between people and local produce. We give tours to local primary school . children who are amazed to see apples taken from a local tree.’ Waste: Despite all the wonderful apples we have growing in Britain, such as the Cox Orange Pippins, many supermarkets prefer to import . The Sixties and Seventies marketing campaign for America’s Golden Delicious apple has often been blamed for the decline in native orchards. But there are other reasons that pre-date the arrival of the Golden Delicious, particularly the need to turn much of the countryside over to more crucial foods during World Wars I and II. But the biggest reason is the growing power of the supermarket giants over our fruit consumption during the past half-century. The retailers will say they are only giving us what they want, but in truth, they are  leading our tastes. They wanted apples all year round — including out of the British season — and they wanted apples that could be shipped and stored for long periods. They also demanded disease-free apples with a decent profit margin and  guaranteed consistency of shape. The small-scale orchards of Britain couldn’t guarantee these things. So their delicate, charmingly odd-looking apples, available only in season and prone to disease, lost out to large-scale producers and foreign big boys. Varieties such as Gala are available all year round because they can be grown in the southern and northern hemispheres. A single Gala tree can produce a much higher yield than native British breeds. Only 65 per cent of apples on a Cox’s tree are good enough to be sold as ‘class one’ in the supermarket, while 90 per cent of the fruit on a Gala tree qualifies. A ‘class one’ apple must conform to strict guidelines about size, shape and taste. Class two, which allows for greater variety in appearance, is rarely bought by the supermarkets. Thus, many of these cosmetically imperfect, but otherwise perfectly tasty, apples go to waste. Therefore, apples are now bred on an industrial scale, for efficiency of production, uniform size and blemish-free peel. All at the cost of taste. ‘The taste becomes secondary,’ says Mr Fitzgerald. ‘If people were given a traditional “heritage” variety, they just wouldn’t know if it was OK to eat. But the uniform apples, like Pink Lady or Jazz, fit the bill for an urbanised society, which likes the comfort of familiarity.’ Still, though, at the Rivers Nursery Orchard, there remains a small patch of the idyllic fruit orchards that once covered Hertfordshire, much of East England, Somerset and the Vale of Evesham in Worcestershire. The names of the 70 varieties of fruit growing here have a poetry all of their own: Barnack Beauty, Gascoyne’s Scarlet, Orleans Reinette. There is an Egremont Russet, already turning a pretty bronze, even though it is some time till the first Sunday in October, when the apples will be harvested by volunteers, to be sold as they are or turned into cider. In one corner of the orchard, there are Pitmaston Pineapples — a variety of apple that grows in a distinctive pineapple shape. Although it’s early in the season, you can see its tropical outline. British apples: The delicious Egremont Russet will be ready to eat in October . The orchard, once in disrepair, has been restored by the volunteers following the advice laid out by Thomas Rivers in The Orchard House, his 1850 treatise that sold more than 12,000 copies, making it a bestseller of its day. The volunteers have planted tall beech hedges on the borders of the orchard to keep out the wind and produce an ideal micro-climate for apple-growing. They have cut back the grass to stop it competing for the nitrogen that is so vital for good apples. And when an old tree dies, they replace it with a young heritage variety. Now, the orchard seethes with life. Woodpeckers have pecked countless holes in some of the trees, without causing any damage to the fruit, which is picked before it becomes ripe enough for the birds to eat. Insects fill the air, trees and grass — including the rare noble chafer beetle and goldenrod crab spider. Scenes like this needn’t be lost for good. Today, there are some small signs of recovery in the growth of community orchards such as these. And Apple Days, held in the autumn during the fruit-picking season when people can come and pick their own, are becoming increasingly popular. There is even a thriving apple community in London, run by the London Orchard Project, which plants small orchards in the city. Sales of heritage fruit trees are up, too. There is one final piece of the jigsaw, though. We all need to choose to eat more of our ancient apple varieties — and give a wide berth to the bland, blemish-free imports.

She had thought that radiotherapy would destroy her dreams of motherhood . Everybody needs good neighbours. But in the case of Naomi Armitage, hers went above and beyond the call of duty…and became a surrogate for the child she couldn’t have. Hayley Wells offered to help Mrs Armitage after learning of her plight in a doorstep chat. Mrs Armitage, 33, had been diagnosed with cervical cancer and radiotherapy was going to destroy her dream of motherhood. Her only hope of having a child was to undergo a course of IVF with husband Richard, 31, before the treatment and then find a surrogate to carry the embryo. Mrs Wells, a mother of three, happily stepped in and now the Armitages have been blessed with what they call their ‘miracle baby’, seven-month-old Amelie Mireya. Mrs Armitage said: ‘The first thing I said to the consultant when he told me I had cancer was chop my arm off but don’t tell me I can’t have children. It was the only thing that was important to me. ‘Then within a week of being told I would never have children I had found my surrogate. Amelie is a dream baby in more ways than one and is all I focused on throughout my radiotherapy.’ The Armitages, who have been together for three years, had just started trying for a baby in 2011 when Naomi went for a routine smear test. A week later she was told there were some abnormal cells and the following month she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. With . a great deal of support from Nuffield Health, a health service where . Mrs Armitage worked as a learning and development manager, she had the . tumour and surrounding lymph nodes removed. But . she was told days later that there was a lymph node that had slightly . enlarged and she would have to undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy – . which would prevent her from having a baby. The . couple, from Leicester, were told they could not delay the radiotherapy . and try to have a baby first and that their only option was to have one . round of IVF before the treatment started and find a surrogate mother. Surrogate mother Hayley Wells with husband Brett. Hayley offered to help her neighbour after hearing her plight when chatting on the doorstep . Mrs Armitage added: ‘My friends told me to focus on the treatment and getting better but all that was important to me was having a baby. ‘It was frustrating because at that point I had all the right bits to have a baby but every time I went for radiotherapy it felt like it was another step in ruining the chances of me having children. ‘I spent the weekend trying to find out about surrogacy but I couldn’t find any help and started to think it was more and more uncommon.’ On the Monday she was stood on her doorstep waiting for a friend to arrive when she started chatting to Mrs Wells, her neighbour of four years. She was outside with her youngest child who was being naughty and jokingly asked Mrs Armitage ‘do you want her?’ Mrs Armitage said: ‘Because of the circumstances I welled up. I said I would have her. I ended up telling her the news and she said of course I will be your surrogate. The couple, from Leicester, have 12 more eggs frozen so may have another child . ‘I didn’t her expect her to actually do it for us. We didn’t know each other too well, we hadn’t even been in each other’s houses.’ Amelie was born five weeks prematurely on January 5 this year after Mrs Wells was implanted with one of the embryos created by the IVF. She was given the middle name Mireya – a Spanish name meaning ‘miracle’. Mrs Armitage is now clear of cancer and the couple are legal parents to Amelie, as well as genetic parents. The couple have 12 embryos still frozen so have not ruled out having another baby. Mrs Armitage added: ‘For now, just Amelie is perfect, she’s beautiful. It just shows that if you put your mind to it, anything is possible. ‘We were very lucky, Hayley gave us an incredible gift and we will be thanking her for the rest of our lives.’","Naomi Armitage, 33,  had been diagnosed with cervical cancer .

Prince Harry was ‘deeply saddened’ by the death of a third potential SAS recruit – who had served as his gunner in Afghanistan. Corporal James Dunsby, 31, of the Royal Yeomanry, died last week after collapsing on an SAS selection exercise on the Brecon Beacons in soaring temperatures on July 13. Two other soldiers died on the day from suspected heat exhaustion. Prince Harry struck up a close friendship with Cpl Dunsby during his first tour of Helmand province when they were part of a three-man crew of a Spartan armoured car. Prince Harry (second from left) became friends with Corporal James Dunby (right) as they fought together in Afghanistan in 2008 . Harry, a junior officer in the Household Cavalry Regiment, acted as commander and Cpl Dunsby was at the controls of the vehicle’s General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG). Harry and Cpl Dunsby worked together in early 2008 as their unit conducted desert patrols and fought fierce battles with the Taliban. The Prince said goodbye to him when he was forced to leave Afghanistan after the international media broke an embargo over his presence there. Last night, a Royal source said Harry was shocked to learn of Cpl Dunsby’s death, adding: ‘This has been very unpleasant news for the Prince. Prince Harry and Cpl Dunsby had a 'shared sense of humour' 'He remembered Cpl Dunsby as they shared some exciting and  harrowing times during their three months together. They got through everything thanks to a shared sense of humour. ‘Cpl Dunsby was Harry’s gunner and occasionally his driver. As their regiment was serving in a long-range reconnaissance role, they were very exposed and  often found themselves far from British support. ‘Harry was in much greater danger on that tour of Afghanistan than most people realise.’ A Kensington Palace spokesman confirmed Harry was aware of Cpl Dunsby’s death but stressed that it was a ‘private matter for the Prince’. The deaths of Cpl Dunsby and the two other recruits who died on the SAS march – Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, and trooper Eddie Maher, 31 – are the subject of a police investigation. An inquest heard that the cause of the men’s deaths was ‘unascertained’ at post-mortem. The Mail on Sunday revealed last week that SAS instructors waited three hours after the recruits were first seen to be in distress before raising the alarm with civilian agencies. This newspaper has also established that when a request was made to the Wales Air Ambulance  (WAA) to provide a helicopter, none was available. At just after 4pm on July 13, all three helicopters flown by WAA were engaged in other emergencies. The SAS’s request for a helicopter was subsequently patched through to the Great Western Air Ambulance based in Bristol. Whether this delay was a factor in the recruits’ deaths forms part  of the police investigation. An MOD spokesman said: ‘The Army is co-operating fully with this investigation. It would be inappropriate to comment further until it is complete. Speculation about this incident is wrong and distressing for the families.’ Corporal James Dunsby, a member of the Army Reserves, died after falling ill during SAS selection training in the Brecon Beacons .

A Baltimore grandmother has been accused of poisoning her 17-month-old grandson to death with Methadone. Towanda Reaves, 50, has been charged with murder and child abuse after admitting to police that she rubbed the powerful drug on the gums of two of her grandchildren so they would go to sleep during a July 4 visit. The other grandchild, a girl born three months after the deceased boy, survived the dose. Normally given to heroin addicts to help them overcome their addictions, Methadone can also be used as a painkiller. She just wanted them to sleep: Police say Tawanda Reaves admitted to rubbing Methadone on the gums of her toddler grandchildren, causing one to die . Police investigation the toddler’s death initially operated under the assumption it was an accident, according to WJZ, but the guilt-ridden grandmother eventually fessed up. ‘She confirmed that she had given methadone to the children and put it on the gum lines of their mouths,’ Detective Jeremy Silbert, Baltimore City Police, told WJZ. Reaves told investigators she put her grandchildren to sleep around 8pm on July 4, according to reports. She could still hear them breathing when she woke up around 2am to turn off the air conditoner, one of the toddlers was unresponsive by 4am, causing her to call 911. Aadyn Overton was pronounced dead at a local hospital less than an hour later, reported ABC 2. When the same hospital received a visit from a baby girl that tested positive for methadone, the hospital called police, according to ABC 2. She is expected to make be okay, WJZ reported.

Mr Harper sought to defuse a growing storm over the checks by also insisting they were not ‘random’ but based on ‘specific intelligence’. He also revealed that so far 17 people had been arrested on suspicion at two London Underground stations but was unable to say how many in total had been stopped. Migrant row: Tory Immigration Minister Mark Harper, left, has denied claims by anti-racism campaigner Baroness Doreen Lawrence, right, that controversial immigration spot checks were linked to people’s colour . The Equality and Human Rights Commission is now investigating the checks for possible discrimination. Last week, Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence and who is now a Labour peer in recognition of her fight against racism, said she thought ‘racial profiling’ was involved in the checks. 'A matter of urgency': Labour spokesman Chris Bryant has demanded statistics on stops . But Mr Harper insisted: ‘We weren’t . stopping people based on their race or their ethnicity. We were only . stopping people and questioning them where we had a reasonable suspicion . that they were an immigration offender.’ He also said no ethnic details about people questioned were recorded, with officers noting only people’s nationality, name and date of birth. Mr Harper told BBC radio: ‘We are not carrying out random checks of people in the street and asking people to show their papers. That’s absolutely not what we are doing.’ Denying any racial profiling, Mr Harper said: ‘It’s about how they behave, not what they look like.

Labour spokesman Chris Bryant has demanded the release of statistics on the number and ethnic background of people stopped and accused Ministers of whipping up a ‘moral panic’ over immigration for electoral purposes. He said: ‘If it feels as if what is basically happening is that they are going to some parts of the country and stopping every person with a black face, then that is totally unacceptable. ‘What we really need from Home Secretary Theresa May is precise numbers of where these stops and searches were being done, what the percentage was of people who were arrested.

"By . Karen Evennett . PUBLISHED: . 19:40 EST, 29 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:40 EST, 29 July 2013 . Susan Thornton, 48, had nine episodes (in which she was rushed off to A&E to treat her chest pains and breathlessness) before it was revealed she has Conn's syndrome . High blood pressure affects around ten million people in the UK. Dubbed the silent killer, the condition is often symptomless yet is a leading cause of stroke, which strikes around 150,000 Britons every year and kills 40,000. The condition is defined as having blood pressure readings above 140/90 - and the risk of stroke doubles with every 20 point rise in systolic blood pressure above 115 (this is the top number and measures the blood pressure during every heartbeat - the bottom number, diastolic, is the blood pressure between beats). Because of the considerable risk of stroke, high blood pressure must be immediately treated when diagnosed. Patients can be prescribed medications such as beta-blockers, and given lifestyle advice about cutting salt in the diet and taking regular exercise. However, for one in five patients with high blood pressure, the pills are of little help, and do not lower their readings, despite doctors trying them on numerous medications. This 'resistant hypertension' is not only frustrating for patients, it can also have disastrous consequences, as their stroke risk remains high. Yet doctors have previously been at a loss to how to treat these resistant cases. 'We owe it to patients to make sure their unexplained hypertension is investigated,' says Morris Brown, professor of clinical pharmacology at Cambridge University, who is a consultant at the city's Addenbrooke's Hospital. But recent findings suggest our hormones may be to blame - specifically one called aldosterone. This controls salt levels in the blood, and too much of the hormone can lead to high salt levels and high blood pressure. Now scientists have realised some people who do not respond to blood pressure pills have small non-cancerous growths on their adrenal glands, which produce aldosterone. These glands sit on top of the kidneys and  are also crucial for producing adrenaline and various other hormones. When the glands develop these growths, they start to overproduce aldosterone. This causes high salt levels in the blood and sends blood pressure soaring. This condition is called Conn's syndrome, and may affect up to one in four people with treatment-resistant high blood pressure, says Professor Brown. He explains that too much aldosterone also causes levels of the mineral potassium to drop, and sufficient amounts of this mineral are essential for keeping blood pressure low. 'Instead of getting rid of salt, the body hangs on to it in exchange for potassium - the very mineral needed to balance and normalise blood pressure - which is pushed out of the body, so exacerbating the problem.' Charles Payne had been taking high doses of six different blood pressure drugs daily for almost ten years before it was discovered his hypertension was hormonal . It can also cause tiredness and lethargy because of the low potassium levels, as this mineral is needed to keep muscles functioning properly. But the condition is under-recognised by doctors, leaving patients trying one drug after another without benefit. This happened to Susan Thornton, whose high blood pressure was diagnosed only after a routine check-up with her GP.  She says: 'The doctor didn't tell me what the reading was, just that it was above average and, though I didn't need to take a drug, he suggested more exercise.' This was three years ago, and Susan, then 45, took her GP's advice. 'I started swimming daily and felt better, until one afternoon when driving to collect my then partner from work. I suddenly felt extremely ill and had to pull over. 'I had mild chest pains and was breathless and feared something was happening to my heart.' Susan, a mother-of-four from March in Cambridgeshire, called an ambulance and was rushed to her local hospital. En route, her blood pressure read 200/104. By the time she arrived at A&E, it had gone off the digital scale. However, blood tests and heart checks showed no problems, and doctors discharged her the following day with pills called ACE inhibitors to lower her blood pressure. They failed to take effect and, over 18 months, she had eight similar ambulance admissions - with her blood pressure alarmingly high. Doctors tried a number of different medications, including beta-blockers, but nothing seemed to work, and the side-effects left her feeling unwell. But a chance discovery 18 months after her first episode revealed the true cause. A doctor sent her for further tests on her heart, including an angiogram, which involves sending a tube into the vessels around her heart via an artery in her groin. This releases a special dye, enabling the vessels to be seen under X-ray. However, during the procedure the doctors were worried that one of the blood vessels in her groin had started to swell, and gave Susan a CT scan. Although this showed the vessel was fine, it highlighted a small 17mm growth on her left adrenal gland, and Susan was diagnosed with Conn's syndrome. According to Professor Brown, these growths, called adenomas, can begin in the 20s and 30s, but are so slow growing that they create a problem only in middle-age. Furthermore, the body can compensate for the high aldosterone levels for a number of years, but eventually is unable to do this. Some patients start to develop symptoms before middle-age. 'For reasons that are not clear, young patients are more likely to be women, and to have larger adenomas, whereas older patients tend to be men with smaller growths,' says Professor Brown. 'We think the tumours started at a similar age, but the smaller tumours take much longer to be diagnosed.' Although doctors are still unsure what causes the condition, one possibility is a genetic link, as certain inherited mutations can cause high levels of aldosterone. There is also evidence that high salt in the diet may also trigger the condition, as it damages cells in the adrenal glands. Until recently, Conn's syndrome was thought to affect only a handful of treatment-resistant high blood pressure patients. But recent research, as well as the development of more sophisticated scans, has revealed that many patients have the microscopic growths - adenomas - in their adrenal glands, which trigger excessive levels of aldosterone. High blood pressure, known as the silent killer, is often symptomless but is a leading cause of stroke, killing 40,000 Britons every year . Professor Brown says although one in ten treatment-resistant cases has obvious growths on their adrenal glands, a further 10 to 15 per cent may have microscopic growths which are visible only with a special scan called a PET-CT. This uses a mildly radioactive dye to locate nodules, and CT scans to pinpoint location. However, these scans are expensive, and still may not show very small growths. Instead, to confirm diagnosis, he recommends a £15 blood test to check levels of the kidney hormone renin, which is almost always suppressed in Conn's syndrome and is a good indicator of it. 'If renin is low, then a further blood test costing about £25 can check aldosterone levels, and then a scan can look for tumours,' he says. We can survive with only one adrenal gland, so if one is affected, it can be removed with surgery. However, if both glands are affected, surgery is not an option. Professor Brown adds that, for some reason, only 50 per cent of older patients respond to surgery. Instead, doctors prescribe drugs that block aldosterone production, with common ones including spironolactone (which may trigger the growth of breast tissue in men) or the more expensive eplerenone. 'Once resistant hypertension has developed, the chances of this being due to high aldosterone are so high that renin should be measured, if only to make sure the patient receives the correct drugs, as these are not usually used in hypertension,' says Professor Brown. One patient who understands the importance of an accurate diagnosis is Charles Payne. The 63-year-old business adviser from Bishop's Stortford, Herts, had been taking high doses of six different blood pressure drugs daily for nearly ten years - yet even on this regimen, his blood pressure remained exceptionally high, hovering around 180/120. 'My GP eventually offered a referral to a cardiologist,' he says. 'By luck, the one with the first appointment was at Addenbrooke's, where I was invited to join a British Heart Foundation-funded trial for patients with resistant hypertension, under Professor Brown, who early on told me he suspected my hypertension was hormonal.' With no tumours, Charles did not qualify for surgery, but tests showed his levels of aldosterone were high, suggesting microscopic growths in his adrenal glands. A combination of the drugs eplerenone and amiloride, which maintains potassium levels, now keeps his blood pressure at a steady 135/90. Professor Brown explains: 'Not only is high blood pressure a major health risk, but the low levels of potassium can be very fatiguing. 'As soon as we redress this balance - with surgery or aldosterone-blocking drugs - potassium levels return to normal, and patients often feel more energetic.' Susan Thornton has not suffered from high blood pressure since having surgery to remove the growth in her gland. 'I haven't taken any other blood pressure drug since the operation and I am so relieved to be free of their side-effects,' she says. 'I felt I'd returned from a very long journey and found myself again.'","Those unresponsive to the pills may have growths on their adrenal glands .

Holly Hatfield, 23, had been looking forward to travelling home from Berlin to East Midlands Airport last July after completing her studies for her masters degree in the German city. But she was mortified when she went to take her seat and discovered that she had to move due to her size - and would need a seatbelt extender. Holly weighed 23st 7lb at the time and was a size 28. Holly Hatfield, 23, from Belper in Derbyshire lost an incredible 12 stone in nine months . She has since slimmed down by eight sizes to a slender 12, and she weighs a healthy 11st 7lb. 'I had always been big, but the incident on the EasyJet flight was the catalyst for finally taking action to lose the weight,' said Holly, from Belper in Derbyshire. 'I boarded the busy plane and managed to grab an aisle seat - a seat I normally chose on account of the extra space. 'I realised at that moment that I would need a seat belt extender, but when I asked for one the flight attendant explained that because I was the last row they could not have any one using an extender in those seats. 'She then asked a lady in the row in front of me if she would swap seats. The passenger had a spare seat next to her. 'The airline handled the move discreetly and without fuss.

She slimmed down from 23st 7lbs to a svelte 11st 7lbs . Holly had always been fond of her food and enjoyed feasting on takeaways - especially pizza.She turned a blind eye to the warning signs that her weight was spiralling out of control, even when she used to call her dad from the bottom of the road leading to their family home asking for a lift up the hill. But the plane ordeal persuaded her to tackle her weight once she arrived back in the UK.'I'd always been on the big side,' she said, 'even at primary school I was always the biggest of my friends and I got bigger in high school. 'As I got older and had my own money to spend I would treat myself to a lot of fast food after my lessons. Holly - pictured at the start of her weight-loss journey, was mortified to need seatbelt extender on flight . 'The choices at school weren't great either. 'And when I got to university I continued to eat a lot of take always and didn't take time to cook healthy meals. Instead I relied on convenience food. 'I ate a lot of carbs. My meals were often all about the bread. I was definitely a boredom eater. 'When I was at a loose end I would look for something to eat to occupy my mind. 'I wasn't an emotional eater, I've never been bullied and I never had family issues. 'If I was at home and there was something in the kitchen I would pick it up and graze on it without giving it a second thought.' As her weight continued to rise, Holly, who attended Keele University where she also studied for her first degree in sociology and American studies, turned a blind eye to the negative impact it was having on her life. 'It just seemed like I would never be able to stop eating or slim down, so it became easier not to do anything about it,' she said. 'It did hold me back though. I realise that now. I wasn't able to do any of the activities that my friends were enjoying. If someone was going on a bike ride, I couldn't go. PE was always a nightmare. 'There are lot of hills in Belper where I live. I found it very tiring to walk anywhere, so it became easier just to stay at home. 'I used to call my dad to ask him to pick me up from the bottom of our road in his car and drive me home.

It was a real struggle to fit me in the car. It was so embarrassing.' The retail assistant had tried various diets before but they had done nothing to curb her obesity. Then she tried the LighterLife weight management programme and started the diet in August 2012.She was provided with specially formulated food packs, including soups, porridge, milk shakes and snack bars which she used for eight months until April. She also attended counselling sessions, in which she was coached into cutting down on the carbs and instead eating more fresh fruit and vegetables. And she began exercising, taking swimming and yoga classes. Holly's remarkable collection of photos documenting her weight loss shows her spectacular results . Holly reached her current target weight by May - and is now able to walk up the hill without relying on her dad for a lift. She also landed her first job in retail. Holly's excess weight is equivalent in size to actress Pauline Quirke, who slimmed down to 12st from 19st 6lb a couple of years ago. 'It might not be for everyone,' she said, 'but once I decided I wanted to lose weight I just wanted it gone. 'It was quick but I did feel great throughout the whole programme. I now go swimming every week and have started doing Yoga classes with my mum. Holly, who is now a healthy 11st 7lb, and a slim size 12, can walk up a hill without needing a lift . 'It still amazes me that I can walk up a hill to my house from work without having to call my dad to come and pick me up - I could never manage the steep climb before. 'Apart from the physical changes it's changed my outlook. Now I want to get up and do things. I'm just more bouncy and energetic. Before the weight loss I didn't realise how little I did. Now I want to ride a bike and go ice skating.' Currently working on the shop floor for a high street clothing chain, Holly hopes to develop her career in retail. 'I really like retail and I'm really interested in the psychology behind retail and how things are marketed.' And asked what advice she would offer others looking to tackle their weight problems she said: 'I think it's a personal thing but you have to be in the right mind set. I tried diets before, but I wasn't in the right mind set, I just wasn't in the mood. You can't do it by halves.'

The parents of a ten-year-old boy have been cited for disorderly conduct after a fight broke out at the end of a Little League baseball game. James and Jammie Dyer, from Greeley, Colorado, are facing charges after Mr Dyer allegedly confronted the other team's coach after his son was told off for trying to distract players. Footage of the brawl that followed, involving about 18 people, was filmed on a cell phone until Mrs Dyer allegedly knocked the phone to the ground and hit the woman who owned it, witnesses claimed. Jennifer Metzler, who was at the competitive playoff on Tuesday last week, claimed that parents were rolling on the ground and that one man . was kicked in the groin as the parents began fighting. 'The boys were crying; all the boys were crying,' Ms Metzler told 9 News. Although . other people were allegedly involved, only the Dyers have been charged, . because police said they believed the couple had instigated the fight and that the others were only trying to intervene. '[They were] cited for assault, . disorderly conduct and theft, because it was reported that the cell . phone was taken away and that mom had punched several people,' Greeley . Police Sergeant Susan West said. The tension at the Greeley Evans Youth League game began when Mr Dyer approached the coach of the other team, who had allegedly told his son off during the game. 'All of a sudden this guy comes over very aggressively and puts his finger through the chain link fence, throwing m***** f***ing and throwing F-bombs left and right at the coach,' one parent, who did not want to be identified, told 7 News. He added: 'The coach wasn't responding to him and that got him even more angry.' The situation escalated when Mrs Dyer allegedly hit a woman and knocked the cell phone she was filming on to the ground. 'Some punches were thrown. And there was a charge of theft because the woman, Jammie Dyer, took the cell phone away and then refused to give it back to her,' Sergeant Steve Black said. However, the Dyers are fighting the charges and claimed they were the victims. Mr Dyer is facing a charge of disorderly conduct and his wife is facing charges of misdemeanor assault, disorderly conduct and theft. Charged: Jammie and James Dyer have been blamed for starting the fight, which allegedly involved 18 adults . Strikeout: The fight began at a Greeley Evans Youth League game for ten-year-old boys . They told 7 News that  Mrs Dyer did take the cell phone, but they were the ones who were attacked, adding that somebody threw a sports drink bottle at Mrs Dyer's head. 'They were just trying to defend themselves,' Nicole Garza, a witness, said. 'The other team's parents circled around him and started kicking and punching him.' The young boys who witnessed the fight are being offered counseling. 'It is embarrassing, and the thing that makes it the most embarrassing is it's about kids and sometimes parents forget that we do this for kids and not for the adults,' Rick Juarez, president of the Greeley Evans Youth League, said.","Couple charged with disorderly conduct after game for ten-year-old boys .

He said that traditional spelling classes are unnecessary when students have constant access to state-of-the-art technology. Obsolete: A university professor has said that there is no place in schools for spelling and grammar lessons . Professor Mitra said that pupils should be encouraged not to rely on linguistic rules but to try and express themselves in new ways such as using mobile phone text messaging. The professor spoke out as the Government introduces a drive aimed at improving educational standards that will see pupils tested on spelling 200 complex words by the end of primary school. Alternative: Professor Mitra has said that youngsters should be encouraged to communicate in other ways such as via text messaging . A separate test in spelling, punctuation and grammar was introduced in England for 11-year-olds this year. GCSE students have also been told that they will be docked marks in exams if they do not use accurate English. Professor Mitra said in an interview with the Times that emphasising spelling and grammar in the classroom is: 'a bit unnecessary because they are skills that were very essential maybe 100 years ago but they are not right now. 'Firstly, my phone corrects my spelling so I don't really need to think about it and, secondly, because I often skip grammar and write in a cryptic way.'

A multibillion-dollar information-sharing network of 77 so-called fusion centers violated Americans’ civil rights and failed to produce any valuable intelligence on terrorism, according to a scathing Senate report released on Wednesday. What began as an attempt to put local, state and federal officials in the same room analyzing the same intelligence has instead cost huge amounts of money for data-mining software, $6,000 laptops, flat screen televisions and, in Arizona, two $45,000 fully equipped Chevrolet Tahoes that are used for commuting, investigators found. The 141-page, bipartisan report is an unflinching evaluation of what the Department of Homeland Security has held up as a crown jewel of its security efforts. Wasteful: A Senate report concluded that fusion centers improperly collected information about innocent Americans and produced no valuable intelligence on terrorism . The report underscores a reality of post-9/11 Washington: National security programs tend to grow, never shrink, even when their money and manpower far surpass the actual subject of terrorism. Much of this money went for ordinary local crime-fighting. Disagreeing with the critical conclusions of the report, Homeland Security says it is outdated, inaccurate and too focused on information produced by the program, ignoring benefits to local governments from their involvement with federal intelligence officials. Because of a convoluted grants process set up by Congress, Homeland Security officials don't know how much they have spent in their decade-long effort to set up so-called fusion centers in every state. Government estimates range from less than $300million to $1.4billion in federal money, plus much more invested by state and local governments. Federal funding is pegged at about 20 per cent to 30 per cent. Despite that, Congress is unlikely to pull the plug. That's because, whether or not it stops terrorists, the program means politically important money for state and local governments. A Senate Homeland Security subcommittee reviewed more than 600 unclassified reports over a one-year period and concluded that most had nothing to do with terrorism. The panel's chairman is Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. ‘The subcommittee investigation could identify no reporting which uncovered a terrorist threat, nor could it identify a contribution such fusion center reporting made to disrupt an active terrorist plot,’ the report said. When fusion centers did address terrorism, they sometimes did so in ways that infringed on civil liberties. The centers have made headlines for circulating information about Ron Paul supporters, the ACLU, activists on both sides of the abortion debate, war protesters and advocates of gun rights. One fusion center cited in the Senate investigation wrote a report about a Muslim community group's list of book recommendations. Others discussed American citizens speaking at mosques or talking to Muslim groups about parenting. No evidence of criminal activity was contained in those reports. The government did not circulate them, but it kept them on government computers. The federal government is prohibited from storing information about First Amendment activities not related to crimes. ‘It was not clear why, if DHS had determined that the reports were improper to disseminate, the reports were proper to store indefinitely,’ the report said. Homeland Security Department spokesman Matthew Chandler called the report 'out of date, inaccurate and misleading.' He said that it focused entirely on information being produced by fusion centers and did not consider the benefit the involved officials got receiving intelligence from the federal government. The report is as much an indictment of Congress as it is the Homeland Security Department. In setting up the department, lawmakers wanted their states to decide what to spend the money on. Time and again, that setup has meant the federal government has no way to know how its security money is being spent. Inside Homeland Security, officials have long known there were problems with the reports coming out of fusion centers, the report shows. Hundreds of draft reports sat for months, rendering them effectively obsolete, while Homeland Security analysts who reviewed the reports would often deride the information in them as useless. ‘I see nothing to be gained by releasing this report,’ one analyst wrote repeatedly on several draft reports. ‘This report does not provide the who, what, when, where, how,’ another official complained about a document. ‘You would have some guys, the information you'd see from them, you'd scratch your head and say, “What planet are you from?”2 an unidentified Homeland Security official told Congress. Until this year, the federal reports officers received five days of training and were never tested or graded afterward, the report said. States have had criminal analysis centers for years. But the story of fusion centers began in the frenzied aftermath of the September. 11, 2001, attacks. The 9/11 Commission urged better collaboration among government agencies. As officials realized that a terrorism tip was as likely to come from a local police officer as the CIA, fusion centers became a hot topic. But putting people together to share intelligence proved complicated. Special phone and computer lines had to be installed. The people reading the reports needed background checks. Some information could only be read in secure areas, which meant construction projects. All of that cost money. Branching out: Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano embraced the idea that fusion centers should look beyond terrorism . Meanwhile, federal intelligence agencies were under orders from Congress to hire more analysts. That meant state and local agencies had to compete for smart counterterrorism thinkers. And federal training for local analysts wasn't an early priority. Though fusion centers receive money from the federal government, they are operated independently. Counterterrorism money started flowing to states in 2003. But it wasn't until late 2007 that the Bush administration told states how to run the centers. State officials soon realized there simply wasn't that much local terrorism-related intelligence. Terrorist attacks didn't happen often, but police faced drugs, guns and violent crime every day. Normal criminal information started moving through fusion centers. Under federal law, that was fine. When lawmakers enacted recommendations of the 9/11 Commission in 2007, they allowed fusion centers to study 'criminal or terrorist activity.' The law was co-sponsored by Senators Susan Collins and Joe Lieberman, the driving forces behind the creation of Homeland Security. Five years later, Senate investigators found, terrorism is often a secondary focus. ‘Many fusion centers lacked either the capability or stated objective of contributing meaningfully to the federal counterterrorism mission,’ the Senate report said. ‘Many centers didn't consider counterterrorism an explicit part of their mission, and federal officials said some were simply not concerned with doing counterterrorism work.’ When Janet Napolitano became Homeland Security secretary in 2009, the former Arizona governor embraced the idea that fusion centers should look beyond terrorism. Testifying before Congress that year, she distinguished fusion centers from the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Forces that are the leading investigative and analytical arms of the domestic counterterrorism effort. ‘A JTTF is really focused on terrorism and terrorism-related investigations,’ she said. ‘Fusion centers are almost everything else.’ Congress, including the committee that authored the report, supports that notion. And though the report recommends the Senate reconsider the amount of money it spends on fusion centers, that seems unlikely. ‘Congress and two administrations have urged DHS to continue or even expand its support of fusion centers, without providing sufficient oversight to ensure the intelligence from fusion centers is commensurate with the level of federal investment,’ the report said. And following the release of the report, Homeland Security officials indicated their continued strong support for the program.","77 fusion centers were created to encourage law enforcement agencies to share intelligence .

American Psycho character Patrick Bateman is pictured . Dutch scientists have found that psychopathic criminals do not entirely lack empathy but fail to use it automatically. Psychologists at the Social Brain Lab in Amsterdam have discovered criminal psychopaths can switch on the ability to empathise with another person at will, which could explain why they can be simultaneously callous but socially devious. The researchers studied convicted criminals with a diagnosis of psychopathy watching film clips of people interacting to conclude that while psychopaths are capable of empathy, they might hurt others more easily than we do, because they do not automatically feel pain when they see the pain of their victims. Offenders diagnosed with psychopathy pose a significant threat to society, because they are more likely to harm other people and to do so again after being released. A new brain imaging study shows psychopaths have reduced empathy while witnessing the pains of others but when asked to recognise other peoples' emotions they can activate their empathy. Researchers say this could explain why psychopaths can be callous and socially cunning at the same time. Psychopaths characteristically demonstrate reduced empathy with the feelings of others, which may explain why it is easier for them to hurt other people. However, what causes this lack of empathy is poorly understood. Scientific studies on psychopathic subjects are notoriously hard to conduct. Professor Christian Keysers, head of the Social Brain Lab in Amsterdam and lead author of the study, said: 'Convicted criminals with a diagnosis of psychopathy are confined to high-security forensic institutions in which state-of-the-art technology to study their brain, like magnetic resonance imaging, is usually unavailable. 'Bringing them to scientific research . centres, on the other hand, requires the kind of high-security . transportation that most judicial systems are unwilling to finance.' The . Dutch judicial system, however, seems to be an exception. They joined . forces with academia to promote a better understanding of psychopathy. As . a result, criminals with psychopathy were transported to the Social . Brain Lab of the University Medical Centre in Groningen where the team . could use high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging to get a . glimpse of the brain of criminals with psychopathy while they viewed the . emotions of others. Psychologists at the Social Brain Lab in Amsterdam have discovered criminal psychopaths (such as Dr Hannibal Lecter played by Sir Anthony Hopkins in the film Red Dragon) can switch on the ability to empathise with another person at will, which could explain why they can be simultaneously callous but socially devious . The study, published in the journal Brain, involved 18 individuals with psychopathy and a control group. Dr Harma Meffert, who was involved in the study, said all participants first watched short film clips of two people interacting with each other, zoomed in on their hands. The movie clips showed one hand touching the other in a loving, a painful, a socially rejecting or a neutral way. The criminals were asked them to look at these movies just as they would watch one of their favourite films. Then they watched the same clips again. However, this time the researchers prompted them explicitly to empathise with one of the actors in the movie and asked them to really try to feel what the actors in the film clip were feeling. Dr Meffert said: 'In the third and final part, we performed similar hand interactions with the participants themselves, while they were lying in the scanner, having their brain activity measured. 'We wanted to know to what extent they would activate the same brain regions while they were watching the hand interactions in the movies, as they would when they were experiencing these same hand interactions themselves.' She said the human brain is equipped with what scientists call a 'mirror system'. A brain imaging study shows psychopaths have reduced empathy while witnessing the pain of others but when asked to recognise other peoples' emotions they can activate their empathy. Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh who played Norman Bates and victim Marion Crane in Psycho are pictured . For example, the motor cortex of the brain normally allows you to move your own body. Your so called somatosensory cortex, when activated, makes you to feel touch on your skin. Your insula, finally, when activated makes you feel emotions like pain or disgust. Brain scientists have discovered that when people watch other people move their body, or see those people being touched, or have emotions, these same brain regions are activated. In other words, the actions, touch or emotions of others become your own. It has been suggested that people with psychopathy might somehow suffer from a broken mirror system, resulting in a diminished ability to empathize with their victims. However when asked to just watch the film clips, the psychopaths did activate their mirror system, but less so than people without psychopathy. Professor Keysers said: 'Regions involved in their own actions, emotions and sensations were less active than that of controls while they saw what happens in others. 'At first, this seems to suggest that psychopathic criminals might hurt others more easily than we do, because they do not feel pain, when they see the pain of their victims.'","This could explain why they can be simultaneously callous but socially devious, say Dutch researchers ."

'I'm 40 and I remember when Prince William was born... the Americans have a real romance with the royals,' he said.

They are just interested in everything to do with the royal family,' she explained. 'We did a similar thing for the royal wedding. We had a television up and people came in at 5 a.m. to watch it.

'There's a lot of excitement. It's hard to move around... Everyone is just watching that door.' The relief comes after Morales was pictured passing the time by eating fish and chips, drinking ale, reading British literature and knitting a gift for the baby as she waited for news of his or her birth last week. Coverage of the birth blanketed the main networks on Monday morning, with every one sending out their top hosts and correspondents to provide viewers with the latest news of the royal baby. As the birth of the boy was revealed on Monday afternoon, all the networks cut to the announcement. 'I feel the excitement her even in the United States,' CNN's Brooke Baldwin said on Monday afternoon. Relief: NBC host Natalie Morales grins as she delivers the latest news on the birth of the royal baby - after weeks of having nothing to report . Outside the hospital, Morales was joined on NBC by medical editor Dr Nancy Snyderman, who described the procedure for a woman in labor.

But it seems she may have drawn on a little Hollywood inspiration for her outfit at the Gatcombe Horse Trials over the weekend. Unfortunately for Anne, she appeared to have followed in the footsteps of Charlie Chaplin in her rather unusual choice. Uncanny: Princess Anne's casual androgynous look (left) bore a striking resemblance to Charlie Chaplin's trademark tattered suit (right) The Princess Royal, 62, was resplendent in a blue and grey striped hat, a navy blue blazer, striped shirt, blue chinos and leather loafers. And when she leaned on an umbrella, the likeness to the Little Tramp star of the silent movie era was complete. She did, however, show off a dazzling smile, something of a rarity for the usually stern Anne. She joined her daughter, Zara Phillips, who was riding her horse High Kingdom at the trials on Saturday. Family affair: The Princess Royal joined her daughter Zara Phillips, who was riding in the Gatcombe Horse Trials . Zara, 32, who is expecting her first baby with husband Mike Tindall, rode dressage for a panel of judges in a ‘guinea pig’ trial designed to help them mark the riders. Zara’s appearance came after she decided to give up competitive riding for the remainder of her pregnancy. Princess Anne is known for being the thriftiest member of the Royal Family and is a keen recycler of outfits. Time for a cull? Princess Anne is notoriously spendthrift and has often broken fashion's first rule of only wearing an outfit once. She first wore this outfit in 1990 (left) and it reappeared 20 years later in 2010 (right) She recently appeared in a yellow hat that she had first worn to Zara’s christening. So if the hat she wore to the horse trials looked a little battered around the edges, there is no doubt it has probably had quite a bit of wear before. When asked once about her thriftiness with clothes, the princess explained that the Queen, something of a style icon herself, had brought her up not to be wasteful.","Princess Royal, 62, joined her daughter Zara Phillips who was riding in the trials ."

Anger has broken out among Jewish groups in Poland over plans to build a memorial to non Jews who risked their lives to save those trapped inside the Warsaw ghetto. Under the plans, the memorial to Polish 'righteous' gentiles will be located in the heart of what used to be the Warsaw ghetto. However, this has angered the Jewish community in Poland who claim it would infringe on the memory of murdered jews. Controversy: Anger has broken out among Jewish groups in Poland over plans to build a memorial to non Jews at the site of former Warsaw ghetto. In this picture, a group of Jews are escorted from the Warsaw Ghetto . Although the Jewish community do not dispute the reasons behind the monument, it feels it should be placed on the edge of the site. According to the Telegraph, Poland's Centre for Holocaust Research wrote in an open letter: 'Poland is a large country so there is plenty of capacity for a monument to the Righteous, but let the Warsaw Ghetto remain an inviolate area dedicated to the memory of murdered Jews.' Unhappy: For many, the efforts of Christian Poles who risked their lives to smuggle weapons into the Warsaw ghetto and to get prisoners out have been sidelined . For . many, the efforts of Christian Poles who risked their lives to smuggle . weapons into the Warsaw Ghetto and to get prisoners out have been . sidelined. The Warsaw Ghetto was established in the Polish capital in 1940, while the country was being occupied by Nazi Germany. All 400,000 Jews living in the city, which was then a major centre of Jewish culture, were ordered to live in the area, which was surrounded by a 10ft wall. Even though the Ghetto housed 30 per cent of Warsaw's population, it occupied just one-fortieth of the city's area, leading to unbearably cramped conditions. The area was plagued with disease and starvation, causing the deaths of thousands - but the worst horrors came between July and September 1942, when more than 250,000 residents were sent to the Treblinka camp, where nearly all were murdered by the Nazis. In January 1943, German soldiers started another round of deportations, but this time the Jewish residents fought back. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising briefly succeeded in stopping the deportations, but later that year was brutally put down. 56,000 Jews were killed or deported in retribution. They feel . more attention has been placed on Jewish insurgents who launched a . battle against Nazi rule in 1943 knowing that they faced death. They . battled for a month during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and inspired jews . all around the world. But those behind the plans for the monument feel the efforts of the Christian Poles should be given a greater recognition. Doctor . August Grabski, from Warsaw's Jewish Historical Institute, said: 'What . we have here is almost a competitive bidding between the Polish and . Jewish communities over the scale of their martyrdom in the Second World . War'. The dispute comes days before Poland prepares to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. It is not the first time a statue has cause outrage and disturbed sensitivities surrounding the Warsaw Ghetto.

Cattelan, entitled 'HIM', attracted a large number of visitors. The work was visible only from a distance, and the artist has not said what he intends viewers to read into Hitler's pose. Organisers of the exhibition of which . the statue was a part said its point was to make people reflect on the . nature of evil - but some were angered by its placement in such a . sensitive site.","Memorial to Polish 'righteous' gentiles would be in heart of former ghetto .

"By . Deni Kirkova . PUBLISHED: . 12:47 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:51 EST, 4 August 2013 . An editor of French Elle has written a book about the 'scandalous' life she led as a celibate woman in today's sex-obsessed society. Sophie Fontanel, 50, has named her memoir (French: roman) The Art Of Sleeping Alone. It is 'a mélange' of things that happened to her, vignettes and semi-autobiographical anecdotes. The decision simply to not have sex is most refreshing and unusual for someone who does not define themselves as asexual. In fact, asexual is a word she rejects along with celibacy, chastity and abstinence, opting instead for ""singularity"". Sophie Fontanel says the fact that women can make love when and how they want is sexual liberation. But sexual liberation is also to not do it, if you don't want to . 'People were saying, ""This is insane, . this account you've written about your life... How is it possible?"" They . talked to me as though I were some sort of animal,' says Sophie. The 50-year-old editor and author experienced a period of prolonged self-imposed celibacy that was 'so easy' to embark on. The book is less about 'why' and more on 'what' and what it means. However, her singularity ended its 12 year run when she rekindled her sexuality with her partner - a then-married man. 'If you force yourself to make love, . your sex life isn't as good as the one you dreamt of or expected, if you . don't feel respected, can you just stop? The answer is yes,' she says, speaking with the Sunday Telegraph's Stella magazine. 'The fact that women can make love when . and how they want is sexual liberation. But sexual liberation is also to . not do it, if you don't want to.' 'What is miraculous about sexuality is that is can die out but it can be rekindled in seconds,' says Sophie, who has never married nor had children. She admits: 'As I said in the book, there are two things I missed when I stopped having sex. 'One is the loss of self when you make love, you are always in control. The second thing is to be caressed, to be in someone's arms, with your head on his shoulders.' 'If your sex life isn't as good as the one you dreamt of, can you just stop?' philosophises Sophie .","Sophie Fontanel, 50, is an editor at French Elle and bestselling author .

The pink-haired Super Sonico made her debut in 2007 and proved an instant hit with Japanese men, who found other characters such as the demure Hatsune Miku a little too demure. Last summer, the company launched a version of the pillow with squeezable breast inserts but decided to up the ante with this summer's launch. Strange though the Super Soniko pillow seems, it is far from the being the first unusual companion for lonely males dreamed up by a Japanese company.

Recently, the hugely popular venture launched a 'oshiri makura' service which lets visitors rest their heads on the women's bottoms in the privacy of a private booth. Sadly for those men looking for a comfortable derriere on which to rest their head, a minute of oshiri makura time costs 1,000 yen (£6.50) - £390 an hour.","The body pillow is based on erotic computer game character Super Sonico .

Running an investment portfolio is a far cry from selling papers on the street to sympathetic passers-by. But the Big Issue, the magazine that supports the homeless, has drawn up plans to branch out into fund management. Big Issue Invest, the magazine’s finance arm, intends to raise some £250m over the next five years and to invest the cash in projects with a social conscience around the UK. It hopes to attract backing from City institutions, foundations and rich individuals to fund fledging community businesses. A woman selling copies of The Big Issue, which was founded in 1991 to help the homeless find a place to live and work . The Big Issue has already dipped a toe into the water, raising £20m for investment in new businesses back in 2005. It was an early stage investor in Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant project, that offered training and jobs to disadvantaged young people. But its latest plans will put it into a much bigger investment league. ‘Since the financial crisis, people are looking at new ways to raise cash and support companies. We are interested in funding firms in poorer areas or employing people who find it hard to get work. ‘We want to extend the boundaries of what is a traditional investment. These will be sustainable projects, which will offer worthwhile returns,’ said Nigel Kershaw, Chairman of Big Issue Invest. ‘This is a step change.’ Mr Kershaw is looking for a chief executive with City experience to lead the fund raising effort. He said: ‘We want someone who has spent a lot of time in the City and feels it is time to put something back. We want them to use their experience and know-how to raise investment.’ The new chief executive will lead the magazine group’s fund raising, which it hopes will get off the ground by the end of the year. Big Issue Invest chairman Nigel Kershaw, pictured with a copy of the magazine, is looking for a chief executive with City experience to lead the fund raising effort . In addition to supporting Fifteen, the . Big Issue has also backed London-based transport business Connection . Crew, which takes 25 per cent of its recruits from the homeless. It has also given £1.8million to . Moneyline, the Blackburn-based not-for-profit company which lends cash . to people who are unable to secure bank loans. Mr Kershaw said: ‘These are the types of businesses we want to back with the new fund. There are a lot of opportunities out there.’ Moneyline’s business model differs greatly from payday loan firm Wonga, condemned last month by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby for exploiting the poor, which charges annual interest of over 5,800 per cent. The Big Issue was founded in London in 1991 by John Bird and Gordon Roddick, the husband of the late founder of the Body Shop, Anita Roddick. It supports the homeless by turning them into vendors and giving them a cut of the magazines they sell. The magazine now has operations in cities as far afield as Tokyo and Nairobi.","Magazine hopes to attract backing from City institutions, foundations and rich individuals .

And you can’t do anything about it. ‘I think experiencing my wife’s life and then death has encouraged me to feel like this. She was an amazing woman.

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 16:08 EST, 28 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:30 EST, 28 June 2012 . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was found in contempt of Congress on Thursday as the Republican-controlled House of Representatives sanctioned the nation's top law enforcement official for withholding some documents related to a failed gun-running probe. The mostly partisan vote of 255-67 marked the first time a sitting attorney general and presidential Cabinet member was cited for contempt by the full House. No Senate vote will be necessary in this House contempt citation. While 17 Democrats backed the censure, many refused to cast votes and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi led many of her colleagues in a walkout from the House floor in protest. Eric Holder addresses the 83rd LULAC National Convention on June 28, 2012 in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The House of Representatives has voted today on a contempt of Congress charge against Holder . Following the vote holding him in contempt of Congress, Holder, speaking from New Orleans railed against what he called 'truly absurd conspiracy theories'. 'I had hoped that Congressional leaders would be good-faith partners in . this work,' said Holder. 'And some were. Others, however, have devoted their . time and energy to [creating political theater] and truly absurd – . truly absurd – conspiracy theories.' In a previous statement he had made in Florida, Holder was equally scathing. 'Today’s vote may make for good political theater in the minds of some, . but it is — at base — both a crass effort and a grave disservice to the . American people. They expect — and deserve — far better,' said Holder on . Thursday evening. The White House also issued a statement, condemning the contempt vote as a political gesture. 'Unfortunately, a politically-motivated agenda prevailed and instead of . engaging with the President in efforts to create jobs and grow the . economy, today we saw the House of Representatives perform a . transparently political stunt,' said the White House this evening. Later in the day, the House also was scheduled to vote on a resolution asking U.S. courts to force Holder to turn over documents being sought by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee as part of its long-running investigation of the Fast and Furious. The Attorney General said that he had taken steps to 'facilitate robust congressional oversight' and that he had tried to work with Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and his allies. 'My efforts to resolve this matter short of such a battle were rebuffed . by Congressman Issa and his supporters. It’s clear that they were not . interested in bringing an end to this dispute or obtaining the . information they claimed to seek. Ultimately, their goal was the vote . that — with the help of special interests — they now have engineered,' said Holder. That could lead to a prolonged court fight with an uncertain outcome while a judge weighed the House demand against the Obama administration's claim of executive privilege to protect the documents. The unprecedented House rebuke of Holder was overshadowed by the U.S. Supreme Court's upholding of Democratic President Barack Obama's controversial healthcare law - a ruling that was reverberating throughout the country. Nevertheless, the House devoted much of its legislative session on Thursday to a sometimes bitter debate over Holder's role in 'Operation Fast and Furious,' which was aimed at following guns being purchased in Arizona to determine whether they flowed into Mexico for use by drug cartels. From left, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi right, and many House Democrats walk out of the Capitol during the vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt . The Justice Department initially denied that a program was being run that allowed some guns to 'walk' into Mexico - a contention it later retracted, raising Republican suspicions. According to government figures, between 2007-2011, of 99,000 firearms recovered in Mexico and submitted to U.S. law enforcement, more than 68,000 came from the United States. In recent years, those weapons have shifted more and more from handguns to high-powered rifles. By early 2011, Fast and Furious had been terminated after disclosures that federal agents had lost track of many of the high-powered weapons, which subsequently were traced to crimes, including the murder of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. House Republicans and Democrats have engaged in arguments all year over issues ranging from budget and taxes to contraceptives. Thursday's debate was no exception. Attorney General Eric Holder speaks at the League of United Latin American Citizens National Convention in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. This is the first time a sitting Cabinet member has been held in contempt. Republican Representative Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, called the Arizona law enforcement operation 'reckless.' Issa added the contempt vote was being held 'because when we asked legitimate questions ... about Fast and Furious, we were lied to. We were lied to repeatedly and over a 10-month period.' Pelosi accused Republicans of using the election-year contempt charge to undermine Holder's efforts to combat voter suppression in some states. 'This is something that makes a witch hunt look like a day at the beach,' Pelosi told reporters. 'It is a railroading of a (contempt) resolution that is unsubstantiated by the facts.' The tussle between the Obama administration and House Republicans is over the release of a series of documents dating from February 4, 2011, when the Justice Department initially denied that guns were being allowed to 'walk' into Mexico. The dispute is both legal and political. Republicans asserted their right to obtain documents needed for an investigation of Operation Fast and Furious — focusing on 10 months in 2011 after the Obama administration initially denied guns were allowed to 'walk' from Arizona to Mexico. By year's end, the administration acknowledged the assertion was wrong. President Barack Obama asserted a broad form of executive privilege, a legal position designed to keep executive branch documents from being disclosed. The assertion ensures that documents will not be turned over any time soon, unless a deal is reached between the administration and congressional Republicans. In debate, however, Republicans framed the issue as the need for closure for the family of Brian Terry, a Border Patrol agent killed in December 2010 in a shootout with Mexican bandits. Two guns from Fast and Furious were found at the scene. Democrats said the contempt issue was a political stunt to embarrass the Obama administration in an election year, and added that holding the attorney general in contempt will do nothing to bring closure to Terry's family. For the past year and a half, . some Republicans have promoted the idea that Holder and other top-level . officials at the Justice Department knew federal agents in Operation . Fast and Furious had engaged in gun-walking. Attorney General Eric Holder testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington. In email exchanges with subordinates in February and March 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder expressed concern that something might have gone wrong in Operation Fast and Furious . Two . of Holder's emails and one from Deputy Attorney General James Cole in . early 2011 appear to show that they hadn't known about gun-walking but . were determined to find out whether the allegations were true. ""We need answers on this. Not defensive BS. Real answers,"" Holder wrote. The . Justice Department showed the e-mails on Tuesday to Republican and . Democratic staffers of the House Oversight and Government Affairs . Committee, whose chairman is Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., in an effort . to ward off the criminal contempt vote against the attorney general. The . full contents of the emails were described to The Associated Press by . two people who have seen them. Both people spoke on condition of . anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about them publicly. Holder . has refused to turn over these and other communications unless the . oversight panel dropped its subpoena for the records — a condition . unacceptable to Issa. The . department withdrew the Feb. 4 letter denying gun walking took place on . Dec. 2, 2011, after documenting what had taken place not only in . Operation Fast and Furious, but in three other gun-walking operations . going back to 2006. In . Operation Fast and Furious, agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, . Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in abandoned the agency's usual . practice of intercepting all weapons they believed to be illicitly . purchased. Instead, the goal of the tactic known as ""gun-walking"" was to . track such weapons to high-level arms traffickers who had eluded . prosecution and to dismantle their networks. Gun-walking . long has been barred by Justice Department policy, but federal agents . in Arizona experimented with it in at least two investigations during . the George W. Bush administration before Operation Fast and Furious. The agents in Arizona lost track of several hundred weapons in that operation. Under pressure: The censure of Attorney General . Eric Holder (pictured), in which a number of Democrats are poised to . join Republicans, is a major embarrassment for President Obama . The high-stakes fight could jeopardize the jobs of some top Justice Department officials if Congress ultimately finds that they were hiding some important information related to Fast and Furious. Conversely, Republicans could be embarrassed if nothing turns up and they devoted so much time and energy amid the need to help the struggling U.S. economy - the top priority of voters in the run-up to the November 6 presidential and congressional elections. The National Rifle Association, a powerful lobbying organization that opposes gun regulation, has made the Holder contempt move a top priority. It has warned all 435 House members that a vote against the contempt citation would be a black mark against them. Republican Darrell Issa testifies to the House Rules Committee about a proposed vote to find U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress during a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on June 27 . The NRA has argued that Fast and Furious was actually a back-door move by the Obama administration to lay the ground for new gun regulations by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which ran the southwest border gun-running investigation. Obama administration officials point out that the Justice Department already has released more than 7,000 documents to Issa's committee and that they showed that top officials in Washington initially knew little about Fast and Furious, which was hatched by law enforcement officials in Arizona. House Democrats, meanwhile, have complained that Issa has rejected their calls to investigate Bush administration gun probes similar to Fast and Furious. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio (left) defended the decision to find Holder in contempt while Republican Elijah Cummings (right) is seen testifying to the House Rules Committee . The fight between Republicans and Holder escalated last week, after the White House exerted 'executive privilege' over the post-February 4, 2011, documents, saying they were protected communications that any administration needs as part of its deliberative process. Issa's committee, in a partisan vote last week, charged Holder with contempt after negotiations to resolve the dispute failed. House Republican leaders immediately announced that the full House debate and vote would come quickly. While contempt of Congress charges generally are aimed at forcing officials to produce information to Congress, legal experts point out that they are very hard to enforce and the action could bring months or years of litigation and stalemate.","The Republican-controlled House of Representatives  voted 255-67 in favor of finding Holder in contempt of Congress .

"By . Bethgibbons . PUBLISHED: . 16:41 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:47 EST, 4 August 2013 . Have you embraced the newest super-berry on the block? The Scandinavian lingonberry — a dark red soft fruit. Research shows drinking the juice can dramatically lower your blood pressure. Long a feature of Nordic diets, you can find lingonberry products in Ikea, Lidl and health food stores. But when it comes to a health boost, all berries pack a powerful punch — and have some rather surprising benefits . . . Berry nice! From strawberries to Scandinavian lingonberry - a dark red soft fruit that's the latest on the block- berries are super health foods . BLUEBERRIES FOR STRONG BONESBlueberries have one of the highest antioxidant contents of  any fruit so they’re great for protecting against heart disease and cancer. But one lesser known benefit is that they strengthen the skeleton. A study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research found that a blueberry-rich diet could help develop bone mass. The researchers concluded that compounds called polyphenols (the pigments that give blueberries their colour) appear to stimulate bone cell growth. A second study suggests blueberries could even help prevent loss in bone mass after the menopause. STRAWBERRIES FOR YOUR BOWELMake the most of that bowl of strawberries and cream this summer. Not only do strawberries contain more vitamin C than oranges, they are also one of the best cures for constipation. The high fibre content of the fruit is known to help  improve our bowel function. Blueberries have one of the highest antioxidant contents of any fruit so they're great for protecting against heart disease and cancer . And unlike prunes, which can have the opposite effect if you’re not properly hydrated, strawberries are 92 per cent water. The seeds (around 200 in every berry) sweep through the gut undigested, helping to clean the gut wall and promote colorectal health. BLACKBERRIES FOR YOUR MEMORYThis berry doesn’t just liven up apple pie — it can stimulate brain cells, too. An animal study found blackberry extracts improved balance, co-ordination and memory. The researchers concluded this may be down to the fruit’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Research by the U.S. Human Nutrition Research Center on Ageing even suggests the polyphenols in dark berries improve cognitive function by helping to remove the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain, perhaps protecting against Alzheimer’s. REDCURRANTS FOR BLOOD PRESSUREA CUP of redcurrants contains 308mg of the recommended 2,000mg of potassium you need each day. Potassium is vital to regulate blood pressure and is important for muscles and bones. A deficiency could result in muscle cramps, weakness and an irregular heartbeat. GOJIS FOR ENERGYThis Himalayan berry, available at larger supermarkets and health food shops, contains more beta- carotene than carrots (making it excellent for eye health). Its iron  content (7.6mg per 100g) also far outweighs that of steak (3.7mg) and spinach (2.7mg) combined. Iron is needed to form haemaglobin, the red pigment in blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen round the body, so a lack of iron  can  lead to low energy levels and anaemia. The figures from the Department of Health show a third of women eat so little iron that it is affecting their health — sprinkle goji on your muesli and you won’t be one of them. From gojis being great for boosting energy to strawberries being packed with Vitamin C, berries really do pack a punch . ACAI BERRIES FOR YOUR LOOKSCONTAINING double the antioxidants of blueberries, it’s hardly surprising ‘the beauty berry’, as it has been  dubbed in its native Brazil, is renowned for its anti-ageing benefits. One study by Emory University School of Medicine in the U.S. found fruit flies lived three times longer if they were given acai supplements compared with a control group. It’s likely this is down to anthocyanins in the fruit — these help protect cells from damage by cancer-causing free radical molecules that occur naturally in the body. British blueberry production has grown by 482 per cent since 2008 . The berry is also rich in amino acids and omega fatty acids, which boost hair, skin and nails. RASPBERRIES FOR HEALTHY JOINTSAlmost as potent as blueberries when it comes to their antioxidant content, raspberries are also known to have powerful anti-inflammatory properties. It is thought these stem from anthocyanins, the pigments that give the berries their vivid colour. In animal studies, raspberry extract was found to reduce inflammation, cartilage damage and bone loss, making it a promising treatment for arthritis. CRANBERRIES FOR  A HAPPY TUMThese sharp-tasting berries have long been known to promote a healthy bladder, thanks to compounds called proanthocyanidins, which stop E.coli bacteria from attaching to the bladder wall. New research indicates, however, that the trusty cystitis buster could also help fight off H.pylori, a bacteria associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. In one study of women being treated for H.pylori infection, those who were given cranberry juice alongside the usual medication were more likely to be free from the infection at the end of the study.","Scandinavian lingonberry new superfruit on block .

Sarah is seen sitting up in her hospital bed this week after the successful double lung transplant in June . The parents of Sarah Murnaghan have revealed that their daughter nearly died after complications with a first set of donor lungs and has since had a second transplant . Sarah suffers from late-stage cystic . fibrosis, and her parents' battle to be allowed an organ transplant . provoked a national debate after she was initially denied one on the . grounds that she was too young. Eventually . they secured a court order to ensure she was placed in line for adult . lungs because of the severity of her illness, rather than her age. Sarah . suffered a ‘code blue’ emergency after the June 12 transplant of a . first set of donor lungs at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia failed . and she was placed on machines. Within . three days, on June 15, a new set of lungs became available, her . parents said. Those organs were infected with pneumonia, but the family . agreed to take them because the organs represented Sarah’s last chance . at life. The child underwent a second surgery on June 21, after which she was awakened from a medically induced coma. The family, who had been so public about Sarah's situation, acknowledged they withheld details of her status. 'It was only then that we could allow ourselves to feel real hope and being posting some information on Facebook about Sarah’s progress,' the family statement said. 'We’re . not out of the woods, but Sarah’s health is trending in the right . direction and we wanted to provide more detailed information as to what . she has been going through.' Janet Murnaghan speaks during a news conference outside Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in June . Awake: Sarah Murnaghan, bottom, is awake after she underwent a second surgery on June 21 . Progress: Sarah's parents say she has now recovered enough to open her eyes and take her first breaths . After lung transplant surgery, most patients have their breathing tubes removed within 24 hours and out of intensive care within a week, but while some are released from hospital within weeks, others take months. Doctors had only given Sarah a few weeks to live without new lungs. Since she was too young to be put on the adult donor list, she faced certain death since child donations are rare. Sarah's plight sparked a national . debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children . younger than 12 from the adult waiting list. The Murnaghans scored a . major victory on June 6 when a judge ordered the Organ Procurement and . Transplantation Network to add the 10-year-old to the list for adult . lungs. On surgery day, Mrs Murnaghan said . that had it not been for the judge's recent ruling, they would not have . gotten this set of lungs, which likely came from an adult or teenager. Doing well: Ten-year-old Sarah Murnaghan is taking steps in the right direction after she underwent a double lung transplant, her mother Janet (right) said on Facebook . 'Sarah would've been number 400 or something on the list,' she said. The Organ Procurement and . Transplantation Network added the 10-year-old to the list on Wednesday night after . U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th.. The . ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has . been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds. On June 12, Sarah's mother said that a set of lungs had become available for her daughter. 'God is great! He moved the mountain! Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page read. 'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the . gift of life.' That afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29 . about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous . but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child . about a week to live, and they were out of options. In this May 30, 2013 file photo provided by the Murnaghan family, Sarah Murnaghan, center, celebrates the 100th day of her stay in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with her father, Fran, left, and mother, Janet . Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan criticized the regulations that kept Sarah from getting an adult lung . 'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said, . adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that . it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one. Lung . transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children . fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, . said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone . Medical Center. He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list. 'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said. The Murnaghans said pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations. Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on . the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age . 11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Holding on: Before the transplant last on June 12, doctors said Sarah had just a week left to live .",Sarah Murnaghan will be moved to a progressive care unit at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia .

Police have named a 'person of interest' in the horrific kidnapping and murder of a 24-year-old woman in South Boston last week - and even the Boston police commission admits he never should have been on the streets. Boston Commissioner Ed revealed on Saturday that Edwin Alemany attempted another attack on a woman in a South Boston park last September but was never arrested, even though the victim managed to grab his wallet and ID and hand it to detectives. Alemany, a 28-year-old serial offender with a record of 52 charges . against him, has not yet been charged with abduction and stabbing Amy . Lord last week. He is currently in jail, facing charges from two similar . attacks on women in the same neighborhood that took place just days . after Miss Lord was killed. Miss Lord was kidnapped outside her . home at 6am when she stepped out Tuesday. She was held hostage for 19 . hours and driven to five ATMs, where she was made to withdraw money. She . was then brutally stabbed to death and her body dumped in a park. 'It's . incredibly frustrating that we're here today talking about a man that . has 18 juvenile arraignments and 34 adult arraignments and is still not . incarcerated,' Davis said, according to Fox Boston. Davis . revealed that on September 28, a 21-year-old woman was attacked by . Alemany in a park at 2am. He grabbed her around the throat and attempted . to strangle her, but she fought back. This surveillance camera image is the last photo of Amy Lord alive. She was kidnapped and made to withdraw money from five different ATMs before she was murdered . Tragic: The murder of Amy Lord, 24, has shocked her South Boston neighborhood. She was leaving her house at 6am to workout when she was abducted off the street . In the struggle, the woman managed to grab Alemany's wallet and ID card before he fled. She . handed that evidence over to detectives. Despite the key evidence, . Boston police never moved in to arrest Alemany or charge him with the . crime - which could have put him in prison for many years. Davis said a review of the police department's case from the 2012 attack reveals that detectives had enough evidence against the serial offender. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino told the Boston Herald he was outraged by the failure of police to lock up Alemany before he could strike again. 'My thoughts were, ""My God, why?"" The system broke down and that system can’t break down when there’s an investigation of a person who committed a crime of such magnitude,' he said. Lord's body was found at Hyde Park's Stony Brook Reservation on Tuesday. She had been stabbed to death . Davis said he and the commanders of the police department's investigative bureaus would conduct a review of past cases to see whether any other incidents like Alemany's alleged 2012 attack had slipped through the cracks. Alemany has been in and out of prison for years and may have been staying with a friend - illegally - at a South Boston public housing complex nearby. Alemany allegedly attacked two other women in the same neighborhood, as well. One attack was reported at 5am on Tuesday - one hour before the abduction of Miss Lord. The second attack took place about 12.10am on Thursday. Both escaped with minor injuries. The murder of Amy Lord - a high school cheerleader and Bentley University graduate - has shocked the neighborhood - resulting in candle-light vigils attended by hundreds and community meetings about neighborhood safety.","Amy Lord, 24, was abducted from her home in South Boston, held captive for 19 hours and then murdered .

For as they spend up to 12 hours a day between them tending their precious plot, pensioners Alan and Mary Watson could never be accused of letting it get overgrown. With 18ft windmill palms native to the Far East towering into the sky, tree ferns from Australia, cordylines and fig trees, it does, however, look like it ought to be sited somewhere tropical. Garden of Eden: Alan and Mary Watson have spent £10,000 on tropical plants to create a paradise in their back yard . You might need a bigger watering can: The plants and 18ft palm trees require constant attention and keep the retired couple busy for up to 12 hours a day . In awe: The couple look up at the canopy of a palm tree and survey their beautiful garden (left). Mr Watson has grown award-winning dahlias and vegetables. His wife Mary (right) considers herself the deputy gardener of the pair . Or at Kew Gardens or as an exhibit at the Chelsea Flower Show, at the very least. But in fact this little piece of paradise has far, far humbler roots. To reach it, you just have to step out of the back door of Mr and Mrs Watson’s red-brick detached house in the suburbs of Derby. It is a far cry from what was there when the couple bought the newly built three-bedroom property in a residential street in 1966 for £3,150 and moved in after their wedding. Back then, the most eye-catching site in the 750sq yard back garden was the clothes drying on the washing line. But they immediately set about transforming the patch of scrub - and right away were so dedicated to the garden that at the start of their marriage they had no stair carpet because they preferred to spend their money on a greenhouse instead. Mrs Watson, 67, a former care worker, said: ‘I had to scrub the stairs on my hands and knees for two years, but I had beautiful tomatoes on the table.’ They first transformed it into a typical English suburban garden. Mr Watson, who worked as a British Rail engineer, grew dahlias and picked up countless rosettes for his vegetables at horticultural shows. It was 15 years ago that, having raised their son Adam and become grandparents, they decided to switch to the tropical paradise look. Keeping up with the Joneses: The Watson's neighbours will have a hard time catching up on the 15 years spent planting and tending to their tropical garden . Then and now: The sparse garden's main feature was a humble clothes line when the couple bought the property 46 years ago (left). They have transformed it into a spectacular paradise (right) Mr Watson, 73, designed it himself and since then they have spent an estimated £10,000 stocking it with its fabulous foliage. Neither of them has ever actually visited a tropical country, so Mr Watson relied on his imagination to plan the lush haven. Dazzling red Bishop of Llandaff dahlias remain as a reminder of the more traditional style, and there is also a fish pond, a waterfall, a lion head fountain and a decking area in the south-facing garden. ‘Alan’s hip had started to play him up so we decided to create a different garden, one with less digging and less work. At least that’s what we thought then - but I’m not so sure now,’ said Mrs Watson. ‘We can do up to six hours each a day quite easily. Alan is head gardener and I’m his deputy. You soon know if you miss a day - it quickly shows.’ While the results of their efforts are gloriously plain to see, their own little ‘Eden project’ has not been without its hiccups. To their dismay, the severe winter of 2010 ravaged many of their prized tropical plants and they lost several, including 6ft tree ferns, to the cold weather. Unassuming: The couple bought their home in Derby in 1966, when they designed their garden in the traditional style. They were so keen on the pastime, they went without carpet for their stairs so they could afford a greenhouse . Dazzling Dahlias: The striking red Bishop of Llandaff dahlias stand out against the garden of green foliage . They were so upset that at times, they say, they wondered if they could carry on. But they have replaced plants and restored the garden to its lush former glory once more. They now take extra care to protect the plants in winter and have picked up some unusual tips, including wrapping duvets around tree trunks to keep them warm when the mercury plunges. So what motivates them to do it? ‘What this garden does to people, you can see it in their faces. It blows them away. It’s a stunning and tranquil place,’ said Mrs Watson. Mr Watson added: ‘It takes you on a journey. A garden is the journey of your life.’","Alan and Mary Watson spend up to 12 hours a day tending to their 18ft palm trees in their Derby home .

Prison spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said Billy Slagle, 44, was found hanging in his cell about 5 a.m. at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution south of Columbus. He was declared dead within the hour. No other details were immediately provided. Slagle was sentenced to die for fatally stabbing neighbor Mari Anne Pope in 1987 during a Cleveland burglary while two young children were present. In a rare move, the prosecutor in Cleveland asked the Ohio Parole Board to spare Slagle. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty said jurors today, with the option of life without parole, would be unlikely to sentence Slagle to death. The parole board and Gov John Kasich both rejected mercy for Slagle. Last week, Slagle's attorney argued that a jury never got the chance to hear the full details of his troubled childhood. The attorneys, arguing for a new trial and to delay his execution, said that information met requirements for asking for a new trial, which normally must happen within four months of a conviction. Slagle was 'unavoidably prevented' from filing his request because his original attorneys didn't develop and present the evidence, the filing said. McGinty and Slagle's attorneys had cited his age - at 18, he was barely old enough for execution in Ohio - and his history of alcohol and drug addiction.","Billy Slagle was discovered hanging in his cell on Sunday, ahead of his scheduled execution for Wednesday .

A Crimewatch appeal could help finally snare the savage killer of a little girl who was stabbed and beaten to death more than 20 years ago. Schoolgirl Nikki Allan was just seven years old when she was brutally murdered just yards from her home in Sunderland. She was stabbed 37 times and her head was beaten with a brick before her body was dumped in a derelict warehouse. No one was ever convicted of the 1992 killing and Nikki's brutal murder remains unsolved to this day. But now Northumbria Police are in talks with the BBC's Crimewatch with a view to filming a reconstruction of Nikki's final hours. The schoolgirl's mother Sharon Henderson, 48, is hoping a fresh appeal could finally bring an end to her two decades of heartache. Ms Henderson, of Ryhope, Sunderland, is reported to have said: 'I want to see the killer behind bars. 'The police won't tell me if they have something new but a Crimewatch reconstruction could help me get justice. 'I have never given up hope that justice will be done. I have fought for so long and I know Nikki would be proud of me.' Ms Henderson, who has three other daughters now in their 20s, added: 'I only hope something comes from a reconstruction.' George Heron, then 24, of Wear Garth, Hendon, Sunderland, was Sharon's neighbour at the time of the killing and was charged with Nikki's murder. However, a confession he made to police was ruled inadmissible as evidence by a judge at the trial and Heron was cleared of the charge. He was subsequently ordered to pay £7,000 in damages, money he still owes, after Ms Henderson successfully sued him through the civil courts in 1994 for the battery that led to Nikki's death. Sharon Henderson, the mother of Nikki Allan, hopes the Crimewatch reconstruction will bring her daughter's killer to justice. She said: 'I have never given up hope that justice will be done. I have fought for so long and I know Nikki would be proud of me' George Heron, who was acquitted of the murder of Nikki Allan . A Northumbria Police spokesperson said: 'Unsolved murders are never closed and are regularly reviewed. 'We constantly consider whether advances in forensic techniques open up new avenues of investigation that were not available at the time of the original investigation and we are in the process of doing that in this case. 'We can confirm we've had an initial meeting with Crimewatch. Discussions are in their very early stages and no firm plans have been made.'

William Hague has called for an investigation into election ‘irregularities’ in Zimbabwe as ageing tyrant Robert Mugabe was accused of stealing a seventh term in office. The Foreign Secretary voiced ‘grave concerns’ amid widespread reports of massive vote rigging and intimidation of Mugabe’s rivals. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said yesterday that the 89-year-old autocrat won the election with 61 per cent of the vote, with challenger Morgan Tsvangirai’s MDC party on 34 per cent. Victory? Mugabe voters carry a coffin representing the political demise of Morgan Tsvangirai yesterday . But leaked intelligence documents revealed yesterday that Mugabe used £500million of ‘diamond money’ to rig the elections. The documents, dated June 3, detail how Chinese and Zimbabwean diamond companies pumped cash into a secret fund controlled by Mugabe’s party Zanu-PF. The money was then used to pay an Israeli firm to rig the electoral roll and ‘secure 50 per cent of the adult vote’ for Mugabe. The slush fund was used to gift Mugabe the support of one million ‘ghosts’ (voters who are dead) and 116,000 voters aged over 100. Mugabe took 61 per cent of the vote, but a cloud of corruption hangs over the result . In Zanu-PF strongholds, the number of registered voters far exceeded the adult population. The documents reveal that the electoral roll contained 900,000 duplicate names with identical addresses and dates of birth but different ID numbers, allowing Zanu-PF supporters to vote multiple times in different constituencies. According to the Sunday Times, Joseph Kabila, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, allegedly gave £56million to the war chest and the government of Equatorial Guinea gave £61million. The paper quoted a political adviser with links to the government, who said: ‘Zanu-PF created millions of ghost voters they used to swing the elections in their favour.’ Election observers from the United Nations and the European Union were kept out, while those from autocratic regimes such as China, Russia, Belarus, Sudan and Cuba were invited to attend. But the election was judged to be fair by the African Union. And yesterday South African president Jacob Zuma offered ‘profound congratulations’ to Mugabe, urging ‘all political parties in Zimbabwe to accept the outcome ... as election observers reported it to be an expression of the will of the people’. Mr Tsvangirai said he would challenge the results in court. ‘The fraudulent and stolen election has plunged Zimbabwe into a constitutional, political and economic crisis,’ he added. ‘Instead of celebration, there is national mourning.’ Mr Hague said: ‘I commend the people of Zimbabwe on holding peaceful elections. However, we have grave concerns over the conduct of the election.’ Mugabe's rival: Morgan Tsvangirai addresses a media conference in Harare. He called the elections a 'sham' He added: ‘The preliminary statements of the African Union and Southern African Development Community observation missions, and those of the domestic observer groups, have outlined many of these significant concerns. ‘I hope that their final assessments of the elections will take into account the full impact of these irregularities on the outcome.’ US secretary of state John Kerry said the results ‘did not represent a credible expression of the will of the Zimbabwean people’. By Stephen Glover . So William Hague has ‘grave concerns’ about Zimbabwe’s grotesquely rigged elections. Instead of expressing his anxieties, the Foreign Secretary could offer the Zimbabwean people a heartfelt apology on behalf of the British Government for inflicting Robert Mugabe on them in the first place, and then standing aside as he pillaged his country, murdered his enemies and ruined the economy. What has happened in Zimbabwe is to Britain’s eternal shame. When the Foreign Office handed power to him after the 1980 Lancaster House Agreement, its mandarins muttered that Mugabe was probably a decent chap. It was reported that Zimbabweans in MDC strongholds were unable to cast their vote . So decent that within years he had massacred thousands of Matabele supporters of his arch-rival, Joshua Nkomo. Having eliminated his black supposed enemies, he largely left alone Zimbabwe’s white farmers until the late 1990s, when he started to confiscate their farms. Africa’s most plentiful country, once a large exporter of wheat and tobacco, soon became a basket-case. Many died of malnutrition. As the size of the economy halved, Mugabe’s henchmen began printing money on a scale that made Germany’s Weimar Republic look amateur. Tyrant: Mugabe's men massacred thousands of Matabele supporters of his arch-rival, Joshua Nkomo . By the summer of 2008, inflation had reached 231,000,000 per cent. A hundred trillion Zimbabwean dollar note was being printed when the currency finally collapsed. Throughout the illegal seizure of farms, hyper-inflation and murders of Mugabe’s opponents, the Blair Government merely watched. By contrast, it was prepared to intervene in our former colony of Sierra Leone, for which Britain has less moral responsibility. It keenly joined American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Such modest economic recovery as there has been recently in Zimbabwe owes nothing to Britain. In 2009, Mugabe was forced into an uneasy coalition with Morgan Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) – the party he has just stitched up in the elections by blatant vote-rigging and intimidation. Less lunatic economic policies were introduced. At the same time, the Chinese, with their inexhaustible hunger for minerals, have been moving into Zimbabwe. Gold, diamond and nickel mines are being developed. Members of Mugabe’s regime have been enriched, and there has been a small ‘trickle down’ of new wealth to ordinary people. Having ‘won’ 61 per cent of the vote to Tsvangirai’s 34 per cent, Mugabe will probably change the constitution to give himself and his twisted regime all the powers he wants. The MDC will be written out of the political process. In practical terms, there is little Britain or any other western nation can do, other than to maintain sanctions preventing Mugabe and his cronies from travelling to Europe and the United States. China, which has no interest in democracy, is the foreign power calling the shots in Zimbabwe. As elsewhere in Africa, its only concern is that there should be a strong regime with which it can do business. Meanwhile, to their enormous discredit, most other African governments are eager to pat Mugabe on the back, implausibly claiming on the basis of reports from a small number of their own election observers that the election was fair. A police officer keeps watch as Zimbabweans waited to cast their vote in Mbare township outside Harare . Yet the Zimbabwean Election Support Network, with 7,000 observers on the spot, says that up to one million people were unable to cast their ballots, mainly in urban areas regarded as MDC strongholds. Most demeaning of all has been the response of President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, who has extended his ‘profound congratulations’ to Mugabe following ‘successful, harmonised elections’. There may be little that Britain can do, but William Hague should at least speak like a decent human being appalled by the activities of a man who was put into power by a British government, and has caused so much suffering to a once bountiful country. Most whites have long since left Zimbabwe. They have a long list of justifiable grievances against successive British governments. But so, too, do millions of blacks who remain in the country, or have been driven out of it. Their lives have been blighted. This 89-year-old self-serving tyrant, who oddly calls himself a Catholic, is not immortal. The only hope for Zimbabwe is that, where Britain and everyone else have failed, his maker will finally take action.","Foreign Secretary has misgivings over reports of vote rigging .

"By . Andy Welch . PUBLISHED: . 19:44 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:40 EST, 5 August 2013 . My landline rang. It was a Sunday morning and I was surprised because I’d given the number to only three people as I tended to use my mobile phone instead. ‘Hello Mr Welch, Visa Card Services here.’ That was the line with which my nightmare started. The person on the other end of the phone — Mark — told me there had been a number of fraudulent transactions on my bank account since midnight, adding up to about £1,100. What kind of fool? Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean looking like he'd hand his Visa card over to just about anybody . I’d never heard of Visa Card Services before, but then I’d never had money stolen like this before. Maybe this is what happens. Mark then confirmed the last genuine withdrawal I’d made — at a Barclays cashpoint in North London, opposite Highbury & Islington station. He then gave me a reference number and told me to ring the number on the back of my bank card. I did just that, quoted the reference number and spoke to someone who knew all about the supposed fraud. These cunning tricksters had apparently cloned my card at the ATM I’d used and then treated themselves to a few things in the Apple Store on Regent Street. Something didn’t ring true about the whole thing: why, for starters, would someone with a stolen bank card spend only £400 in the Apple Store? But I watch enough consumer TV to know these things happen. The person helping me, Rajesh Khan in HSBC’s card protection department, had my full name, date of birth and, crucially, my address. He said a courier was on the way to collect my bank card for further examination. Initially I flinched, but when he explained they needed to analyse the chip, it seemed to make sense. After all, I’d called the bank myself: this had to be genuine. And that is probably the same reason I typed my PIN into the keypad of my phone when he asked. I packaged the card as requested — wrapped in kitchen roll, packed into an envelope so it didn’t look like a bank card — and waited for the courier. Rajesh called back twice: once to say the car was five minutes away and again to say it was outside, quoting the car’s number plate and describing the driver. He called again later that afternoon to say they’d received the card and that I’d have my money back in a few days. ‘Great,’ I thought. So taken in was I by the efficiency of it all that I went through exactly the same process the following day when Visa Card Services called to say there was now a problem with my credit card. The fraudsters had somehow hacked into my online account, got my credit card details and maxed it out. Stalked: Police said Mr Welch was watched by the fraudsters as he withdrew cash, and they followed him home to find out his address. These were vital pieces of information in making him trust them . Precautions: After being conned out of £5,500, Andy has signed up to fraud prevention services . Good old Rajesh told me this time . there was a shred of hope the criminals would be arrested as they’d made . the mistake of buying Eurostar tickets to Paris on a specific train. The police would be waiting for them at St Pancras. Amazing news! A . few days went by and Rajesh stopped calling. By then I was about £4,000 . out of pocket, so I called the bank, this time from my mobile. After . explaining the situation to two or three people, I heard the most . chilling phrase of all: ‘But Mr Welch, your cards haven’t been reported . stolen.’ I’ve never been speechless before. I’ve never been able to feel the colour drain from my face either. But now I was, and I did. Why had I given my card to a stranger? Why had I typed my PIN into the phone? How did they know my landline number? How did they know my mother’s maiden name? How did they have my address? The police still haven’t been able to establish the answers to these last three questions, but say that such criminals are remarkably adept at gleaning personal information from the internet and the electoral roll. And, most infuriating of all, why hadn’t I checked my balance before I even called the bank that Sunday morning? When I did check, things were far worse than I’d expected. The Apple Store story was all a lie. In fact, they had spent thousands in clothes shops and, best of all, treated themselves to a Dixie Fried Chicken each evening. To cap it all off, my rent payment had bounced. By then, I was panicking. What if I didn’t get a refund? The security expert at the bank said this was a possibility. It would take me years to pay off debt like this. I called the police, who put me onto their dedicated fraud line. After explaining my idiocy once again — it’s pretty humbling, repeatedly telling people you’re the type of person who gives your bank card and PIN to the first person who asks for them — they went through the likely series of events that led to this theft. In the end, the total taken from my account was about £5,500. It all started, said the police, on the Saturday night when one of this gang will have watched me take money from the cashpoint. That’s details of my last transaction taken care of. The police then believe that I was followed home, which is how they got my address. My name and landline number they doubtless obtained with a bit of research online. As for the call, well, it’s pretty clever. Only the person who initiates a landline call can cut it off. If the person who receives the call puts down the receiver, it doesn’t hang up. So, when I went to find my bank card, the fraudsters were still on the other end, waiting for me to pick up the phone and call ‘the bank’. As I did this, they first played a dial tone down the line and then a ring tone. ‘Rajesh’ will have been sitting next to ‘Mark’, the first person who called me, no doubt both laughing their heads off at how stupid I’d been. I was right to praise the bank’s efficiency, though. They got me all my money back within ten days, though I did have to get new bank accounts and cards. It was a pretty lean spell and by the time I got my money back, I’d spent my last 60p on a tin of beans. My family and friends offered money, but I didn’t have a bank account for them to pay money into and there was a chance I had the sharp end of six grand to pay back, so I didn’t need to owe another £50 on top of that. The feeling of total financial ruin, of utter helplessness, isn’t one I’ll forget in a hurry. Setting up new direct debits was an unholy pain and even now, five months on, I’m still having problems. My credit rating has taken a serious knock, while getting the various bank departments to talk to one another and not try to charge me a few hundred quid in overdraft charges was no picnic. I’ve since had to sign up to a number of other bank schemes and government services to protect myself. I get a monthly statement of credit checks in my name, for example, so I’ll know if these  people are using the information they have on me. It took a few weeks to stop worrying about the same people coming back to my house, too, though spending hours online researching the link between bank fraud and violent crime — virtually non-existent — helped with that. Out of everything, accepting that it had happened at all probably took the longest. I’m still coming to terms with it, but I think being a bit more suspicious isn’t a bad thing. Being paranoid, though? Well, hopefully that will just wear off in time. I like to think I’m a tech-savvy, culturally aware person. I read about internet security. I know about phishing: criminals masquerading as a friend or business to dupe you into revealing your passwords or bank details. Yet all that knowledge left me when it counted. Financial fraud is often deemed a victimless crime because, ultimately, it’s only huge companies footing the bill, not individuals. Having suffered the stress, upset and countless hours spent sorting it out, I know it’s anything but victimless.","Fraudsters pretended to be working for Visa Card services .

New doctors will be put off from providing abortion services after recent pro-life protests at clinics around the UK, medical providers have warned. Activists from groups such as '40 Days for Life' have been holding daily prayer vigils outside clinics run by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service in London. Although the group claim their protests are peaceful some have accused them of intimidation. Last month one woman complained she was filmed leaving a BPAS clinic. A prayer vigil is held outside a BPAS clinic in Bedford Square, London: The Catholic religious group has been criticised by pro-choice campaigners of intimidating women . Abortion providers said trainee medics will also be put off from training as the service has recently come under intense political scrutiny. A spokesman for the BPAS said: 'Abortion is a vital yet stigmatised area of women's healthcare which few doctors train in. 'The current politicisation of abortion provision is likely to make it even harder to recruit a future generation of abortion doctors who are prepared to provide the care that a third of women will need in the course of their lifetimes.' The government recently ordered an inspection of 250 clinics in England over fears as many as 20 per cent of them were pre-signing consent forms for terminations. Inspectors had discovered that some doctors . were signing consent forms allowing women to undergo abortions without . knowing anything about their circumstances or why they wanted the . procedure. This breaches the Abortion Act. One doctor from Birmingham was even filmed agreeing to alter paperwork to conceal . the fact he had agreed to abort a woman's baby because she didn't want a girl. Dr Raj Mohan has since been suspended by the General Medical Council. Above board? The Government launched spot checks at 250 clinics over fears they were not following strict guidelines . The subsequent spot checks by the Care Quality Commission revealed that at least 50 clinics . were not complying with the official guidelines. In some clinics inspectors . found that doctors had signed piles of consent forms without knowing . anything of the circumstances of the women involved. By law, a woman can . only undergo an abortion once two doctors have signed a form declaring . that continuing with the pregnancy would put her physical and mental . health at risk. A Department of Health spokesman confirmed that doctors could face jail for breaching the Act. However, pro-choice campaigners said . the majority of providers abided by the rules and felt 'under siege' and . prey to a 'political witch-hunt.' Marie Stopes said none . of its 19 units was found to have breached the rules, while BPAS said . that, to the best of its knowledge, none of its clinics were involved. Dr . Paula Franklin, medical director of Marie Stopes, which has NHS . contracts to provide terminations like the BPAS said it was now . challenging to find doctors willing to work in termination services and . to navigate past angry protestors every day. Meanwhile Dr Kate Guthrie, clinical director with Hull and East Riding Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare Partnership, told The Guardian: 'I really do think that the question has to be asked: what impact is this increasingly negative politicisation going to have on future providers of abortion care? 'Is it going to put doctors and nurses off becoming involved in this work?'","The British Pregnancy Advisory Service and Marie Stopes both have contracts to provide terminations on the NHS .

"By . Daniel Bates . PUBLISHED: . 13:58 EST, 3 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:32 EST, 4 August 2013 . The married socialite who is pregnant with Simon Cowell’s baby cheated on her husband because ‘cuddling up to five Gucci bags’ at night did not satisfy her longing for a man. Lauren Silverman, who has enjoyed holidays on Cowell's yacht - sometimes with her husband and sometimes just with the X-Factor creator, lived a life of luxury that was empty without her husband Andrew around because he was often away on business, the man who raised her has claimed. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Stewart Eisenberg said that Lauren slept with Cowell because she was lonely and you ‘can’t put a credit card under your arm when you go out to dinner’. Family: Lauren, left, with her mother Carole Davis and a family friend . Love triangle: Lauren Silverman pictured with Simon Cowell and her husband, Andrew, left, on a yacht . He revealed that in her youth Lauren ‘broke a lot of hearts’ and had men lining up to date her as she was ‘breathtaking’ in her beauty. Her mother Carole also has a checkered romantic history as she lured Mr Eisenberg away from the woman he was seeing when they first met - and married her next husband ‘five minutes’ after they eventually divorced. Mr Eisenberg, 73, was Carole’s second husband and was married to her for 20 years until they divorced in 2004. Fresh-faced: Lauren Davis, in her year book in 1993, turned heads from a young age . He spoke out as Lauren, 36, and husband Andrew, 37, continued their crisis talks at their $4 million home in Bridgehampton, New York, over her infidelity. The couple are said to be hardly talking but are staying in the same house to try to keep things normal for their seven-year-old son Adam, who has been staying there while attending a nearby summer camp. Lauren meanwhile is 10 weeks pregnant with Cowell’s child, after having an affair which may have been going on for more than a year. Mr Eisenberg, a real estate mogul who lives in Miami, said that Andrew’s long hours and frequent trips away from the family’s New York-based Andalex Group property company may have left Lauren feeling like a bored housewife. She had a driver, fancy clothes, holiday homes and a lifestyle few could dream of - but no man around to dote on her. Instead she began taking holidays with Cowell, who was a friend of the couple’s and was more than happy to have her on his yacht. Mr Eisenberg said that for the past six summers the Silvermans and Cowell have ‘all spent time together’ - illustrating the depth of what Andrew’s brother Alexander has called ‘an unbelievable story of betrayal’. Mr Eisenberg said: ‘I think he is smitten and overwhelmed by Lauren as she is with him. She was not too happy in her marriage and got swept away. ‘I mean she had the money but you can't cuddle up to five Gucci bags and a credit card or take them under your arm when you go out to dinner. ‘I don't think either one intended to plant the seed, but I think they will rise to the occasion and make everything all right.’ Growing up: Stewart Eisenberg with his wife Carole has talked about Lauren's early years . Break: Lauren is spotted taking her seven-year-old son shopping in Bridgehampton, where she is staying with her husband . Coming home: Andrew Silverman spotted arriving back at his house in Bridgehampton, New York Friday . Mr Eisenberg was full of praise for Andrew and called him a ‘bright, very intelligent man but he doesn't make random choices’. He said: ‘Things have not been great between he and Lauren for a while. ‘She is certainly not a gold digger. That's ridiculous. She is very talented and had her own career in fashion and Andrew was very successful in real estate. She doesn't need Simon's money.’ Carole married Mr Eisenberg in 1989 having met him at the Cricket Club, a country club in Miami. He was working out a lot and Carole ‘spotted’ him and, though he was with someone at the time, they got together because the ‘timing’ felt right. Carole had married her first husband Steven Davis in 1973 when she was about 20, though they later split. Keen to give her girls a stable family life, she and Mr Eisenberg settled into a $1 million home in Hallandale Beach, Florida. Both Lauren and Nicole attended Miami Country Day School, which is private and costs $30,000 a year. It is considered one of the best schools in the state. Lauren graduated in 1995 - a photograph from a 1993 yearbook shows her looking fresh faced but undoubtedly very beautiful. Retail therapy: Lauren is spotted taking her son to a toy shop at the weekend . Mr Eisenberg said that when they were together ‘everything was about family’ and they had a ‘wonderful family life’ - something Lauren is now trying to salvage for her own son. He said: ‘Big holiday dinners, vacations. We traveled a lot and those three girls (Lauren, her mother and her sister Nicole) always turned men's heads. They were breathtaking. ‘As a teenager she and Nicole both participated in sports. They were great skiers, ski bunnies who would be on the slopes from morning till night. ‘Yes, Lauren had a lot of suitors and she broke a lot of hearts. A lot of boys were smitten with her. It’s to be expected, she was a beautiful girl. Lauren was feisty, an over-achiever’. Carole, now 60, worked in real estate and the family ‘always travelled in better circles’, intent on moving up in the world. Clearly Mr Eisenberg was not enough for her and they split in 2004. Her third marriage to Robert Saland, who she is still with, took place eight months later in December of that year. Mr Eisenberg said that his divorce was amicable and that he still misses Carole, even today. He said: ‘There was no cheating involved. ' ‘Even though she married her next husband Robert five minutes after our divorce. Sometimes it just happens. She went through some hard times and changes and people change.’ For Lauren, however, things could not be more different. Close: Simon Cowell and Lauren on his yacht in January of this year . Vacation: Lauren posted a picture of Cowell holding up a Union flag during their holiday to St Barts in January . Andrew has not only filed for divorce but taken the unusual step of naming Cowell in the documents as one of the parties. The most explosive claims of all are in now-sealed papers in which he accused Cowell of behaving in a ‘cruel and inhuman’ manner for sleeping with his wife. Adding to his anguish is that just how long the affair between Lauren and Cowell, 53, has been going on is still unclear. Pictures from August last year appear to show Cowell and Lauren apparently kissing on his yacht in St Tropez. Another photo from the same trip showed them cosying up together, next to which she wrote: ‘My lil Simey Monster’. Friends have claimed that Andrew and Laura’s marriage had been in trouble for some time and that they had grown apart. However, speaking to MailOnline Mzia Shiman, Lauren’s beautician who has known her for 10 years, claimed that the couple were not actually estranged. She said: ‘She and Andrew were never separated but Andrew works long hours, he’s often not in New York. ‘She and Andrew were always invited to things together by Simon but if Andrew couldn’t go, sometime Lauren would go on her own.’ Happy days: Cowell and Silverman vacationing in France last August . Close: Simon Cowell appearing to kiss Lauren Silverman on a yacht off the coast of St Tropez, France in August 2012 . Quite how somebody like Lauren met Andrew in the first place is still not certain. Perhaps like her mother did, she ‘spotted’ him across the room at a party in New York. Once they were married she seems to have settled into life comfortably enough - each summer for the past seven years he has paid out $150,000 to rent the seven-bedroom mansion in Bridgehampton for the season. The property has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, four fireplaces, a pool and a huge kitchen. Then there was their New York pad - a luxury apartment in Park Avenue, Manhattan, which is owned by Andrew’s father Allen, a real estate mogul who founded the family business. Over the past few years Lauren has been pictured at a number of Hamptons society events including a Mulberry lunch she attended with Nicole, 32. Andrew rarely figures in such pictures meaning that she would have been away from her husband while he was working 150 miles away in New York or travelling. Since the scandal became public, both families are saying little although even though their son seemed snared by her charms, Andrew’s parents were never impressed by her. Allen and his wife Eleonara refused to go to their wedding at the luxury St Regis hotel in 2003. Sources have said that they ‘did not approve of who she was’ - and now their fears appear to have come true. Friends of Andrew now seem to agree with them. One has said: 'Andrew maybe was in a little bit of denial about this. ‘He knew Lauren had star f***ing tendancies - not literally - and that she enjoyed being around celebrities, but he had no real clue.' She is good for him: Simon Cowell does not have . any plans to marry Lauren Silverman but a source close to the X Factor . mogul has confirmed they are in a relationship . As for the divorcing couple, they have both released separate statements and yesterday Andrew spoke in person for the first time and said that his family were going through a ‘very difficult time’. Cowell, who reportedly has no intention of marrying Lauren, has said: ‘I have to respect a lot of people's feelings right now. ‘There a lot of things I will eventually clear up when the time is right, but I really have to be sensitive because there's a lot of people's feelings involved here.’","Stepfather claims 36-year-old had affair with X-Factor creator because she was lonely .

Hospitals that allow private company reps to bombard new mothers with marketing materials while on maternity wards could face action from the health watchdog under new proposals by MPs. Companies such as Bounty - the UK's biggest parenting club - pay the NHS to allow their reps on to maternity wards to speak to new mothers. Following a series of surveys and campaigns by Mumsnet, which found eight out of ten mothers felt the practise was unacceptable, MP John Robertson is bringing an Early Day Motion on the issue before the Commons. Health minister Dan Poulter, who is also a hospital doctor, has now vowed to take action and insisted the Care Quality Commission has stronger powers to act when a patient's dignity is compromised. Stricter rules: The Care Quality Commission will be able to take action against hospitals if a new mother's dignity is compromised by private company reps approaching them within hours of giving birth . He told the Independent on Sunday: 'Many Bounty representatives engage with women appropriately during pregnancy and before birth. However, I wrote to hospitals about a month ago to highlight the outrageous behaviour of some Bounty reps in showing an unacceptable disregard for the privacy and dignity of women and families at what can be a very vulnerable time. 'We have recently been strengthening the role and powers of the Care Quality Commission to intervene where there is poor care or where patients' dignity is compromised during their care. So if hospitals do not take action to get a grip on the situation, then the CQC will be able to take action against the birthing unit.' Bounty is paid around £90,000 a year to distribute benefit forms at hospitals as it is cheaper than posting them out individually. But the company has been accused in research by Mumsnet of telling new mothers they must sign up to its own parenting club to receive the benefits - which isn't true. Bounty refuted the claims - insisting it has a strong code of conduct for its staff. Other complaints have included private companies pressurising mothers to buy professional photographs or to reveal personal information which is then sold on to third parties. A petition on change.org calling for an end to reps in maternity units has 21,000 signatures so far. It says: 'The hours after having a baby are an important time for mums and their partners to get to know their new baby, learn the skill of feeding and baby care and for the mum to recover from the physical effects of birth. This is a time for rest and recuperation and for the new family and their relatives and friends. 'Interruption from sales representatives there to pass on advertising material and extract data from mothers to sell on, is not something a new family needs. Yet in maternity units across the country this is what is happening, often within the first few hours of a baby being born. On board: Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter has promised to take against to stop the practise . 'Profit motivated parenting clubs such as Bounty are paying maternity units for the right to access their wards and approach mothers just hours after they have given birth. They are also allowed to take photographs of new parents with their babies that they then sell to parents. They generate a large profit both from the photographs and by selling the data they obtain from parents on to companies, who then shower parents with advertising and sales calls. 'A survey by Mumsnet shows over half of new mothers felt the Bounty rep invaded their privacy on maternity wards. Maternity Units are not the place for strangers selling their products. The government must stop allowing sales reps onto maternity wards.' The survey by Mumsnet also found that more than half - 56 per cent - of new mothers felt a Bounty rep invaded their privacy while 60 per cent were not specifically told their personal details would be passed on to other companies. In cases where mothers reported feeling hassled by over-zealous Bounty salespeople, 17 per cent said Bounty reps implied parents would only be able to claim Child Benefit if they filled in Bounty's commercial forms. Justine Roberts, CEO of Mumsnet, said: 'We're very pleased that the government is listening to Mumsnet users' concerns which have led to the Bounty Mutiny campaign. 'We look forward to working with the CQC to ensure that new mothers are protected from hard-sell tactics on maternity wards. 'Some hospital trusts have already taken swift action to address the situation, and we will continue to put pressure on other hospital trusts to review their policies.' But ComRes, an independent research . company, has raised questions over the research. They studied the survey and were concerned by the methods used by . Mumsnet to gain participants (for instance, a tweet with a link to the . survey that read 'Hassled by Bounty? Tell us your experience'. As a result, they have said: 'The . greatest concern regarding the validity of the research is the sample . selection. The survey is not representative of UK mothers and therefore . does not stand up to scrutiny. Eight of ten mothers said reps being allowed on to maternity wards was unacceptable, a survey by Mumsnet found . 'Of concern as well is the fact that . both the framing of the survey on the Mumsnet website, and some of the . questions themselves, are leading. These lead the respondents to a . negative perception of Bounty representatives. Overall, the results of . the survey can be questioned and not be considered representative of . mothers’ opinions.' Clare Goodrham, General Manager of Bounty, added: 'We enforce a rigorous Code of Conduct, which respects mums’ privacy as well as use of any data collected. 'Bounty ladies, many of whom are mums themselves, never enter a ward without being cleared to do so by medical staff.

Google has threatened to ban French newspapers from its search engine if the country passes a law to make search engines pay for the right to use news articles online. The new law, dubbed the 'Google law,' has been spearheaded by French newspapers, and mirrors a similar law under consideration in Germany. The owners of many French newspapers are in favor of the tax, believing their revenue and copyrights are compromised when Google's search results display their content. Google has threatened to remove French newspapers from its search engine if a new tax which would force them to pay to use content comes into force. Google News is a the search giant's computer-generated news site. It aggregates headlines from news sources worldwide, groups similar stories together and displays them according to each reader's personalized interests. Google says stories on the system are 'selected and ranked by computers that evaluate, among other things, how often and on what sites a story appears online.' France's minister for high technology, Fleur Pellerin told France's Le Figaro newspaper that the government is studying the idea and that 'Europe will be stronger if it can move ahead unified on that idea.' She was in Berlin last week to speak with her counterpart about the proposals, a spokesman said. French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti also recently told a parliamentary commission it is 'a tool that it seems important to me to develop.' However, Google says that such a law . would 'threaten its very existence,' according to a letter it sent to . several French officials and published online today. 'There . has been some interest around an extract from a note we have prepared . about a proposal by French news publishers associations to require . search engines to license all of the content that they help users to . find across the web,' said Olivier Esper, Google's Director of Public . Policy in France. 'The web has led to an explosion of content creation, by both professional and citizen journalists. 'So it's not a secret that we think a law like the one proposed in France and Germany would be very damaging to the internet. 'We have said so publicly for three years.' Google . said the move was 'detrimental to French users, innovation on the . Internet and ultimately to the news publishers themselves.' However, . the search giant said: 'We have always been and remain committed to . collaborate with French Publishers associations as they experiment and . develop sustainable economic models on the Internet.' Google's representatives met in Paris . with Fleur Pellerin, the French Minister for small business, innovation . and numeric economy, according to Arnaud Guillois, a spokesman for the . French embassy in Washington. Google is also part of a lobbying group in Germany that opposes the proposed law there, as well, though the company hasn't sent a similar position paper to the German government, a Google spokesman said. Brazilian newspapers have boycotted Google News over the search engine's refusal to pay for content . The latest row comes as newspapers accounting for 90 per cent of the circulation in Brazil have abandoned Google News. Brazil's . National Association of Newspapers says all 154 members had followed . its recommendation to ban the search engine aggregator from using their . content. The papers say Google News refused to pay for content and was driving traffic away from their websites. Google had previously said that the service boosted traffic to news websites. 'Staying . with Google News was not helping us grow our digital audiences,' said . the association's president, Carlos Fernando Lindenberg Neto. 'By . providing the first few lines of our stories to Internet users, the . service reduces the chances that they will look at the entire story in . our websites,' he said in an interview with the Knight Centre for . Journalism. The . National Association of Newspapers, known by its Portuguese acronym . ANJ, carried out an experiment with Google that began in December 2010. This . allowed Google News to carry the top line of news stories to raise . curiosity and get readers to click on the full story on the newspapers' sites. However, ANJ says that the experiment has failed. Among . the 154 titles that have pulled out from Google News are some of the . country's most important news sites such as O Globo and O Estado de Sao . Paulo. At . a recent meeting of the American Press Association in Sao Paulo, Google . defended its decision not to pay for the headlines from news websites. 'Google News channels a billion clicks to news sites around the world,' said Google's Public Policy director Marcel Leonardi. Brazil's . newspaper association said that despite leaving Google News, many of . the news organisations' internet portals will still be listed by the . aggregator. Internet users using Google — but not Google News — will still be able to find content from most newspapers' sites, said ANJ.","Disagreement over so-called 'Google tax' which would force the search giant to pay to use newspaper content .

Four of the perpetrators were given written reprimands after the victims reported the sexual assaults to staff, one student received probation and another was suspended for two semesters but will be free to return next year to graduate - with an Ivy League diploma. Yale, which is based in New Haven, Connecticut, said it responded to a total of eight reports of sexual assault in the first half of 2013. The other two students were found not guilty of rape allegations, the school said. Ivy League: Yale University, pictured, has found six students guilty of 'non-consensual sex' in the past six months and not one of them has been expelled from the prestigious Ivy League college, according to an official report . Yale spokeswoman Karen N. Peart . insisted the university does not tolerate sexual misconduct but she . refused to discuss specific cases. In . the fourth semi-annual Report of Complaints of Sexual Misconduct, . released on Wednesday night, Peart admits the descriptions of cases in . the report 'do not fully capture the diversity and complexity of the . circumstances associated with the complaints or the factors that . determined the outcomes and sanctions' due to confidentiality. But she told The Huffington Post: 'Nonetheless, the range of penalties described in the semi-annual report reflects our readiness to impose harsh sanctions when the findings warrant them.' Yale was required to produce the semi-annual report after the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights launched a federal Title IX investigation the university's handling of sexual violence on campus in 2011. The university avoided any disciplinary action for creating 'a hostile sexual environment.' Instead the investigation concluded in 2012 with a 'voluntary resolution agreement.' This year, Yale was slapped with a $155,000 fine by the Education Department for failing to properly report all sexual violence crimes on campus. Written reprimands: Four of the perpetrators were given written reprimands, one student received probation and another was suspended for two semesters (stock photo) Yale graduate Alexandra Brodsky, who was one of the 16 sexual assault victims who filed the Title IX complaint, was horrified to see Yale had allowed multiple students who have been found guilty of sexual assault to return to campus this fall. She tweeted on Thursday: 'In Sept I'm returning to a campus where, just like when I was a freshman, rape is addressed with ""written reprimands."" What lovely Yale traditions: the Game, Mory's Cups, administrative tolerance for rape.' Another student, Hannah Slater, told Jezebel: 'It's really irresponsible (for Yale) to let known perpetrators of rape stay on campus alongside the survivor and alongside other students who could potentially be victimized in the future. They're not making the campus a safer place.' Slater, founder of campus discussion group, Sexual Literacy Forum, told The Huffington Post that victims regularly tell her they don't bother reporting sex crimes to the university because they don't trust they'll be taken seriously. 'Most of them don't use the Yale complaint system because they don't trust that their needs will be served, and this report proves them tragically right,' Slater said. Brodsky told The Huffington Post she felt she had been let down not just by Yale but by the federal government, which has been heavily criticized for not coming down harder on the university.","Yale University has found six students guilty of 'non-consensual sex' in the past six months and not one of them has been expelled from the prestigious Ivy League college .

Stanley Marsh 3, the eccentric Texas millionaire famous for burying 10 vintage Cadillacs nose-down in an Amarillo field, has been charged with 11 felony counts of molesting children. The decrepit 74-year-old turned himself in at a county jail after an arrest warrant was issued, accusing him of sexually abusing two teenagers in 2010. He was released from Potters County Detention Center on $300,000 bail. His arrest comes just a week after several lawsuits alleging he paid 10 teens in cars, cash, drugs and alcohol for sex acts were filed against him. Charged: Amarillo millionaire Stanley Marsh 3, pictured, is booked into the Potter County, Texas, Detention Center on Wednesday . Mr Marsh will likely be called before a before a grand jury in the next few weeks or in the new year. 'This is the beginning of the process,' special prosecutor Matt Powell said. 'This is what we felt like we needed to do.' The millionaire had the teens engage . in sexual acts, including masturbation and oral sex, on three days in . 2010, according to criminal complaints filed in Potter County. He was charged with six counts of child sexual assault and five counts of sexual performance by a child. Mr Marsh's criminal attorneys, Paul . Nugent and Heather Peterson of Houston, denied the charges, and instead . accused the teens of waiting until the artist suffered a massive stroke . last year to enact their plan to 'become multimillionaires.' 'The investigation into the group's claims is far from complete,' the attorneys wrote in their statement. 'There should be no premature rush to . judgment. Stanley Marsh 3 is not guilty of the group's allegations, and . will fight as vigorously as his declining health permits.' Millionaire: The eccentric millionaire artist, pictured right, is best known for his 'Cadillac Ranch' art display along an interstate in the Texas Panhandle . Supportive wife: Mr Marsh's wife Wendy, second from right, became his guardian after he suffered a stroke . Poor health: The sickly Amarillo millionaire's lawyers denied the sex abuse allegations . The six lawsuits claim Mr Marsh paid . the boys, ages 15 and 16, for sexual acts. One claimed that Mr Marsh . provided him drugs and alcohol, bought him two cars, and paid him at . several points during a year in sums of as much as $10,000. Mr Marsh's civil attorney, Kelly Utsinger, has denied those allegations. The teens' Houston-based civil . attorney, Anthony Buzbee, said two of the young men went to police in . late summer before the lawsuits were filed, but two others didn't speak . with investigators until early November - about the time Mr Marsh's . offices were searched. One teen's mother sought out a civil attorney . when she didn't hear back from police, according to the lawsuits. The lawsuits also claim the . millionaire's wife, Wendy Marsh, and business partner David Weir, knew . of the abuse and covered it up. Mr Weir allegedly went as far as to . force the boys to sign a waiver regarding his colleague's behaviour . while they were in the office as employees or guests. Mr Marsh, who inherited his . grandfather's oil and gas fortune and previously owned TV station KVII, . is best known for burying 10 brightly-coloured Cadillacs nose down along . Interstate 40 in the Panhandle in the 1970s. The cars, ranging from a 1948 club . coupe to a 1963 sedan and gathered from junkyards, private collectors . and used car lots, have since become a pop art landmark. Car ranch: Stanley Marsh 3, pictured, poses with one of the 10 Cadillacs buried down on his ranch in 1984 . Eccentric: In 1997, Stanley Marsh 3, pictured watched as workers lowered into place one of the 10 Cadillacs . Memorable: Mr Marsh put Amarillo on the map with the famous Cadilac Ranch he created in the 1970s . Visitors through the years have . splattered them with graffiti and in 2005 they were coated in pink to . honor breast cancer victims, survivors and their families. Mr Marsh also . has painted them black and yellow to honor the passing of longtime . friends. The installation put Amarillo on the . map in the 1970s and the bizarre attraction inspired a Bruce Springsteen . song a decade later which only boosted its popularity. An Amarillo native and . philanthropist, Mr Marsh and his wife have donated to local art and . education causes.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:11 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:11 EST, 4 August 2013 . The man who confessed to one of the most infamous crimes in New York City's history may go free because authorities say there simply isn't enough evidence to win a prosecution. Last year, Pedro Hernandez, 52, confessed to murdering 6-year-old Etan Patz on May 25, 1979 after luring him into the basement of a SoHo bodega. Once Patz was in the basement, Hernandez says he strangled the boy to death, put his body in a bag and then left him on the street in a pile of trash. The problem for prosecutors is that even though Hernandez has confessed, there's no physical evidence or eyewitnesses linking him to the crime - and Patz's body has never been recovered (it's suspected it was hauled to a landfill). Did he do it? Other than a confession, there is no evidence that Pedro Hernandez had anything to do with Patz's death . Tragic: Etan Patz disappeared in May of 1979 - when he was just 6 years old - while he was walking to school alone for the first time . Another challenge for prosecutors is Hernandez's mental state - according to his attorney, the alleged killer suffers from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 'There’s a consensus among prosecutors there that this case cannot be . won,' a former prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office . told The New York Post. Several members of the NYPD's Missing Person Squad continue to investigate the case looking for any piece of evidence to help prove that Hernandez is the killer - or that he's not. 'They’ve interviewed these people over and over and over again. Some of . them five to 10 times. This has been going on for over a year. It’s . exhausting,' a police source said. Reopened: In 2010, the Patz case was reopened, which led authorities to tear up a cement floor in SoHo looking for a body. They found nothing . Patz's disappearance received a lot of coverage in the media and continues to garner headlines. Patz was the first missing child featured on a milk carton. Over the years, other suspects have emerged in the Patz case, most notably convicted child rapist Jose Ramos, who was a friend of a woman who'd babysat the boy. Ramos was convicted of multiple counts of child molestation and served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania. While incarcerated, a jailhouse snitch told authorities that Ramos had confessed to him that he knew what happened to Patz. However, it wasn't enough evidence for prosecutors to pursue charges. Despite no criminal charges, the Patz family sued Ramos in civil court, where he was found to have been responsible for the boy's death. The Patz's were awarded a ceremonial $2million, which they never attempted to collect. Hernandez was arrested after Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance reopened the case in 2010 and police started getting new leads, including calls from Hernandez's family members who said he'd told them - and his priest - that he killed Patz. Suspect: Until Hernandez's confession, child rapist Jose Ramos always was considered the prime suspect in Patz's disappearance . During his videotaped confession to police, Hernandez asked the officers to kneel and pray . alongside him, which they did. His attorney, Harvey Fishbein, says the officers' praying with Hernandez was 'manipulative.' Fishbein is arguing that Hernandez's mental illness contributed to his making what he believes to be a false confession. 'We are not admitting in any sense that he committed this crime. This is . not a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity — '‘I did it but I was . crazy,'” Fishbein told The Post. 'He didn’t do it. He confessed to it, . and it’s the reliability of that confession that’s the issue here.' Regardless of whether Hernandez's confession is true, both prosecutors and the defense acknowledge that convicting him without any additional evidence will be challenging, if not impossible.","Authorities worry they won't be able to convict Pedro Hernandez because there is no evidence other than his confession .

Andrew Silverman will stay at the Hamptons house alongside his estranged wife Lauren for the foreseeable future for the benefit of his young son, it can be revealed. A family source said: 'Andrew's taking it day by day, he's pretty calm today. 'The whole thing is upsetting, but he's sucked it up and put his feelings aside so he can be with his son - that's his priority. Priority: Andrew Silverman returns to his Bridgehampton home to spend time with his son . 'They both decided to stay in the same house for Adam.' The wealthy property developer is said to be 'not bothered' by many of the photos of his wife and Cowell getting close on vacation - mainly because he was with them at the time. However, in the pictures published yesterday of the pair sharing what seems to be a kiss, the source said: 'It's upsetting.' Despite his wife carrying Simon Cowell's child, Andrew returned to his $4 million Hamptons home on Thursday to 'preserve normality' for his seven-year-old son and stayed the night. But according to reports, the 'crisis talks' with wife Lauren did not happen as the former couple decided not to discuss their impending divorce amid a frosty atmosphere. With all parties reportedly wanting a divorce as soon as possible, the real estate mogul is said to be gunning for sole custody of their child, Adam. Andrew was spotted leaving the couple's house at 9am on Friday after spending the night with his estranged wife and son. But far from trying to build bridges, it seems that the former couple had 'minimal conversation' as the atmosphere was too frosty. Space to think: Andrew Silverman was spotted yesterday speeding away from their Bridgehampton property . 'Andrew stayed at the house to create some normalcy for their son,' a source told The New York Post. 'There was no talk about the divorce settlement. That is being handled by the lawyers. There was minimal conversation between them. It was done purely for their child.' This comes amid reports that Andrew will be applying for sole custody of their son, as sources have told TMZ that his socialite wife reportedly disappears from the family home for long periods of time. Mr Silverman reportedly visited the house on Thursday for talks with his wife over her affair with Cowell. Looking stressed and tense, he told reporters: 'This is a very difficult time. Please keep your distance'. On Friday morning, he sped off in a Mercedes sports car looking stony faced and . wearing a cap and sunglasses. A black Escalade with tinted windows . had already emerged from the garage of the mansion and he followed it to . the end of the road and turned the other way. The Escalade returned 10 minutes after it left and backed into the garage of the house. Andrew was seen driving at speed along country lanes. Meanwhile, Simon's ex-fiancée Mezhgan Hussainy is reportedly furious after believing that he may have cheated on her with Lauren during their relationship. She was spotting arriving at her former love's home on Thursday, suggesting that she wanted to discuss the situation with him. Sources have told The Mirror that Mazhgan is 'horribly hurt' by the fact that Simon may have betrayed her. But according to TMZ heartbroken Andrew is moving quickly to end the 10 year marriage, and wants  to settle custody and financial issues quickly. Distress: This picture of Cowell and Lauren appearing to share a kiss is said to have upset Silverman . He is reportedly asking for full custody of their son, but will negotiate on that point claim TMZ. As Lauren and Andrew held crisis talks a member of her family spoke exclusively to MailOnline expressing support for the brunette and describing her unborn child as the only one 'not guilty of anything'. Speaking from her home in Florida home, Rosa Davis, who is married to Lauren’s father Steven said: 'I speak with Lauren every day. She is doing fine but she has a lot to face, a lot of stuff to cope with and her pregnancy too. 'The main concern for her right now is her son, Adam, and her baby. This baby is not guilty of anything. Babies come into the world and all we can do is receive them with joy.' She added: 'We are a very close family and we always support our kids through the good times and the bad times. You can ask anyone any of our friends.' Mrs Davis would not respond when asked if the revelation of the affair, allegedly a longstanding one between Cowell and Lauren, was a surprise to the close family. She said: 'All I can say is that Lauren is a good parent.' On Thursday, Lauren was accused of being a 'gold digger' after allegedly issuing the music mogul with a string of outrageous demands, telling him she wants marriage and her own reality TV show before she will allow him access to the child. But in spite of the socialite's alleged demands, MailOnline can reveal Cowell does not plan to marry her, even if they are serious about their relationship, with friends of the star revealing he's not planning on rushing down the aisle anytime soon. A source told MailOnline: 'Simon and Lauren are in a relationship, they are very happy – she’s been good for him. 'This is not a situation where they are not together and Simon will just pay for their child. They are a couple. But, there are no marriage plans at the moment.' According to TMZ, Simon still has plans to be a financial figure for the child. Despondent: Lauren appeared low as she visited a toy shop with her son at the weekend . 'He will gladly provide for the child, and not just financially,' their source said.  'Simon is saying he will be a committed, fully-involved parent and says he wants a big role in raising the child.' In divorce papers filed two weeks ago by her estranged spouse Andrew, Lauren was accused of being 'cruel and inhuman' towards her husband. Despite the controversy surrounding her, Lauren looked in good spirits and smiled for the cameras as she made her first public appearance since news of the unplanned pregnancy broke on Wednesday morning. In an official statement later that day, Lauren said: 'I am committed to sorting things out with Andrew as amicably as possible to ensure the well-being of our son. I would hope for some space and privacy in order to work through this.' Her lawyers, Robert Cohen and Bernard Clair of Cohen Clair Lans Greifer & Thorpe LLP, added: 'We are working to resolve this situation in a fair and reasonable way that protects the best interests of our client and her son.' Romance: A picture posted online by Lauren of her snuggling up to Cowell on his . yacht during a holiday . MailOnline can reveal that Lauren and her estranged husband Andrew worked together to co-ordinate their statements, each emphasising that their seven-year-old son Adam was their joint priority. Mr Silverman's stated: 'My top priority is protecting my seven-year-old son while working to resolve all outstanding issues with my wife. Hopefully people can respect the interest of our child during this process.' However, Mr Silverman's brother, Alexander, said what had unfolded in the last few days was 'an unbelievable story of betrayal. It is a sad story and a tragic story'.","Property mogul to push for sole custody of seven-year-old child .

Medical attention: Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo lost two teeth as he was restrained by officers at Belmarsh jail in south-east London . Prison bosses have been accused of ‘political correctness’ for suspending five guards and calling police over an alleged attack on one of the Woolwich soldier murder suspects. Scotland Yard is investigating after Michael Adebolajo, accused of killing Drummer Lee Rigby outside his barracks, lost two teeth in a confrontation with officers in a special high-security cell at HMP Belmarsh. The remand prisoner’s supporters believe if he had not suffered such obvious injuries, the incident would have been hushed up by the authorities. But the union for prison guards insists its members were following rules as they tried to restrain 28-year-old Adebolajo, who is said to have been uncooperative and threatening. Peter McParlin, national chairman of the Prison Officers’ Association (POA), told the Mail on Sunday last night that the five suspended officers were angry and had been made scapegoats by bosses because of the suspect’s high profile. ‘They’re distraught because they feel they’ve done absolutely nothing wrong. They’ve acted along prescribed lines and they’re shocked they’ve been suspended. ‘We’re annoyed with the Ministry of Justice for letting this run that he’d been attacked, when they should have said it was the result of control and restraint incident. ‘I suspect that Ministry of Justice officials have over-reacted, they’ve tried to be politically correct. But I’m afraid that’s not doing our members, as a trade union, any good at all. ‘It’s a prisoner with notoriety. They let the media believe that prisoner had been attacked in prison. The staff felt the need to restrain him. I’m afraid on occasion that’s their job. ‘Some think we’re in a cosy Porridge world. As most sensible people know, that’s not the reality.’ Accusations: Adebolajo is accused of hacking Fusilier Rigby (left) to death together with Michael Adebowale, 22 (right, in a court drawing). The two suspects are due to stand trial on November 18 . Steve Gillan, . General Secretary of the POA, added: ‘Let us be clear this was a . restraint of a prisoner who failed to comply with instructions and . prison officers believed he was a threat to them. ‘My members look . after some of the most difficult and dangerous prisoners on behalf of . society yet there seems little protection for officers against these . sort of allegations. ‘Suspension is wrong in this instance and sends the wrong message to prisoners.’ The Mail on Sunday . understands that Adebolajo and his co-accused Michael Adebowale, 22, are . being held in a special unit in the centre of the Category A jail in . south east London, just over a mile away from where they are accused of . slaying Drummer Rigby in broad daylight in May. Concrete cells in . the unit, originally built to house IRA terrorists, have airlock doors . and are home to some of the highest-risk inmates in the British penal . system. David Bieber, the former US Marine, who shot dead PC Ian . Broadhurst in Leeds in 2003 is also kept there. Adebolajo has . previously accused prison staff of mistreating him. During a bizarre . rant when he appeared by video link at the Old Bailey, he said he was . ‘sick of’ guards demanding to inspect his genitals because of laws made . by a ‘jobsworth’. Violent incident: Adebolajo lost two teeth as he was restrained by officers at Belmarsh jail (pictured) in London . On Wednesday he is . said to have refused to obey prison officers’ instructions during a cell . visit and made ‘aggressive moves’ towards them. When they moved to restrain him, Adebolajo is said to have been badly injured. A family source said: ‘His head was smashed against the window or wall in his cell causing serious injury. ‘If his teeth . hadn’t been knocked out then the Governor could have covered it all up. But he was clearly badly injured and he complained to his family and his . lawyers. He had been expecting something like this to happen.’ Prison authorities . called the Metropolitan Police, who are now investigating an alleged . assault, while the inmate was treated in Belmarsh’s medical wing. Jail: It is understood several officers were called in to help after Adebolajo began acting violently on Wednesday, and he was injured during the subsequent melee in the prison's high-security wing . Crowds of wellwishers line the street as the funeral cortege of Fusilier Lee Rigby drives away from Bury Parish church on July 12 following a funeral service attended by 800 . The next day four . officers, from a group of seven always on hand when Adebolajo’s cell is . unlocked, were suspended from duty and on Friday a fifth guard was sent . home while investigations continue. Adebolajo and Adebowale are due to stand trial in November for the alleged murder of Drummer Rigby, 25, and firearms offences. The Ministry of . Justice declined to comment on the allegations that it had over-reacted . to the prison incident. It would only confirm that five officers had . been suspended while police investigated.

When Nick Robinson bought a holiday home in the countryside two years ago, he did it to escape the hustle and bustle of life in Westminster. But the BBC political editor has been ruffling feathers near his Suffolk cottage after complaining about a commotion of a rural kind. Robinson, 49, was so angry at a cockerel crowing outside his home early in the morning he took to Twitter to say he was ‘contemplating murder’ and joked about eating the bird. Country life: The rooster marching around outside the journalist's holiday home, on the left . Cry of frustration: Robinson bought the home in Orford, Suffolk, to escape the hustle and bustle of Westminster . The rooster’s owner was less than impressed that the city-dweller was moaning about the farming lifestyle that first persuaded him to buy a cottage there. And after a local paper reported his gripes, Robinson has been forced to backtrack, defending his comment as a ‘one-off cry of frustration’. The town-country clash began last week when the BBC journalist was at his property on the coast. On Thursday morning he tweeted to his 180,000 followers: ‘Awoke contemplating murder – the Suffolk countryside isn’t big enough for me and the b****y cockerel who sat outside my window at 5am.’ Shortly  after, he apparently endorsed the comment of BBC colleague Daniel Sandford, who wrote: ‘That’s not murder. That’s lunch.’ Robinson re-tweeted those words, saying: ‘Interesting thought.’ He later retweeted a suggestion that he should make the bird into a haggis, writing: ‘Good tip.’ After buying the cottage (left) he said he loved the village because it was 'laid-back'. Robinson usually lives in Highbury, North London, with his wife Pippa and their three children . As a local paper in East Anglia got wind of the story he tweeted to one of its journalists: ‘Glad you tracked down the fowl bird. Sorry you missed me! Did you photograph them or prepare them for the pot?! #onlyjoking.’ The bird’s owner, Nick Egerton – himself a former Londoner who moved to Suffolk 30 years ago – said crowing was simply what roosters did, adding: ‘That’s all part of country life … they’re just part of the scenery.’ Robinson said last night: ‘I have never and would never dream of complaining about what makes the countryside such an escape – the sights and sounds are natural and not man-made. My tweet was a one-off cry of frustration – a sort of anti-cockerel troll if you like – from a grumpy middle-aged man who had not had enough sleep. ‘I would no more want to have the cock-a-doodle-doos silenced than to pave over the fields or fill in the estuary.’ Robinson usually lives in Highbury, North London, with his wife Pippa and their three children.

Jemima Khan has revealed that her late friend Princess Diana was so 'madly in love' with Hasnat Khan, she considered moving to Pakistan to be with him. In a  Vanity Fair article titled: 'The Grandmother Prince George Never Knew', Jemima says Diana, who dated the heart surgeon from 1995-97, sought her advice during fundraising visits to Lahore. 'She wanted to know how hard it had . been for me to adapt to life in Pakistan,' Jemima told the magazine's contributing editor Sarah Ellison. True love: The September 2013 Vanity Fair features the late Princess Diana on its cover. Inside, the magazine discusses her relationship with Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan . Close friends: Diana pictured with Jemima Khan on 21 February 1996 in Lahore. It was on visits such as these that Diana would seek Jemima's advice on moving to Pakistan . 'Both times she also went to meet [Hasnat's] family secretly to discuss the . possibility of marriage.' Publicity-shy: Hasnat Khan, pictured in January 1997, was in a relationship with Diana for two years . Indeed, Diana was apparently desperately . keen to impress Hasnat's immediate family, especially his mother. But in spite of her best efforts, it would appear that this second love would see Diana yet again falling on the wrong side of an influential family. Even though Diana had an aristocratic lineage, had married (and divorced) Prince Charles, and was mother of the heir to the British throne, Naheed Khan was unlikely to approve of her son contemplating marriage with an English woman. '[For a] son to marry an English girl is every conservative Pashtun mother’s . worst nightmare,' Jemima said. 'You send your son to be . educated in England and he comes back with an English bride. It’s . something they dread.' Though . the couple discussed marriage and children (friends of Diana told the . magazine that she had wanted a daughter with Hasnat), the relationship . fell apart around the time that she met Dodi Al Fayed. Diana's friend Rosa Monckton says Hasnat was the one who initiated the break-up, but other friends argue that Diana ended it because the surgeon refused to marry her. In fact, Rosa insists to this . day that Diana's relationship with Dodi was only to make Hasnat . jealous. On the silver screen: Diana's relationship with Hasnat is at the centre of the upcoming film Diana, starring Naomi Watts in the title role . It would seem that marriage was certainly a point that divided the couple. According to Jemima, Hasnat 'hated the thought of being in the glare of publicity for the rest of his life.' And indeed, in his interview as part of the Lord Stevens inquiry into Diana's death, he called marriage 'a ridiculous idea', adding that he 'told her that the only . way I could see us having a vaguely normal life together would be if we . went to Pakistan, as the press don’t bother you there.' Insider's theory: Rosa Monckton pictured (left) with Diana in 1993, believes to this day that Diana used Dodi Al Fayed to make Hasnat jealous . Royal ties: Diana in 1995 on the VJ Day 50th Anniversary with Harry, William and Prince Charles . Diana's relationship with Hasnat is at the centre of the upcoming film Diana, starring Naomi Watts in the title role. Despite this fact, Vanity Fair reveals Hasnat refused to cooperate with filmmakers, remaining very much the man Diana once described to a friend as 'the one person who will never sell me out.' The September issue of Vanity Fair will be available on newsstands in New York and LA on August 1 and nationally on the iPad, Nook, and Kindle on August 6.

Microsoft took a fresh pop at Google yesterday, accusing its rival of invading Gmail users' privacy when scanning the contents of their emails to target them with personalised ads. The attack, the latest volley in Microsoft's Scroogled campaign, comes with a website and is aimed to boost interest in the veteran software company's Outlook.com email service. It follows a series of Scroogled adverts last year which targeted Google's controversial privacy policies. Scroogled! Microsoft's website to accompany its latest campaign taking a swipe at Google for its policy of scanning Gmail users' emails to target adverts . 'Google goes through every Gmail that’s sent or received, looking for keywords so they can target Gmail users with paid ads,' the website says . 'And there’s no way to opt out of this invasion of your privacy.' It also includes a feed of quotes from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt. These include his infamous declaration that '[i]f you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.' And also: 'We don’t need you to type at all. We know where you are, with your permission; we know where you’ve been, with your permission; we can more or less know what you’re thinking about.' According to data from a survey by Mozaic group published on the Scroogled micro-site, 71 per cent of people don't know that Gmail and some email services scan the texts of the messages they send and receive to target advertising. That same survey showed that 87 per cent of Gmail users feel that using the content of their messages in this was is 'an invasion of their privacy'. 'If you’re a Gmail user, Google scans all of your sent and received messages, extracts keywords that they think are relevant to you, and then uses that data to target you with ads,' the website says. 'And if you’re not a Gmail user but have at some point sent an email to someone that uses Gmail, Google has scanned your message, extracted keywords, and used that data to serve ads to the recipient of your email.' 'Invasion of privacy': Microsoft included this example screengrab from a Gmail conversation with the key words and related adverts highlighted to show how Google scans emails to deliver ads . Stefan Weitz, Microsoft's senior director of online services, told MailOnline: 'One of the key things that separates us from Gmail is the fact that we don’t invade your privacy by going through your emails with the express intent of targeting ads. 'Public opinion, at least in the U.S., is very much against this practice. Nearly 70 per cent don’t even know it’s happening and when they do find out, 88 per cent say it should stop. 'This is a pretty staggering statistic. 'In order to help people hear about this issue, we have taken a little more cheeky tone than we normally might.' Mr Weitz added: 'There are a ton of unanswered questions about Gmail’s practices yet Google continues to mail journos a bland statement about how ads improve the product for consumers. 'Unanswered are how they use information from Gmail scanning to build profiles, how long those live, where that information is used, and more. 'With all their privacy and choice gaffes over the past year, this is not just some inflammatory campaign to get people over to Outlook.com – it hopefully encourages them to be more transparent about how and what they are doing. 'Most importantly, it will hopefully get them to offer users a choice to opt out of these invasive ads (which they can't) or provide them options to have the ads removed (other than signing up for a Google Apps account which, by the way, still has the ad serving code enabled. Why that is no one is sure.) 'There are real issues here around consumer choice and privacy in email. We think we have an excellent product in Outlook.com. 'We want users to know the difference between what we do and what they do. They scan your private communications to target ads and there is no easy way to opt out. We don’t.' Very personal: A Microsoft spokesman admitted the company's campaign was 'cheeky' but added that the company had taken that tone to ensure that people are aware of the issues . Some industry observers have argued that Microsoft's aggressive marketing campaign is selective with the truth. For example, the site claims there is now way to opt out of Gmail's targeted advertising, but there is. Search engine marketing expert Danny Sullivan wrote on the Marketing Land blog: 'Is the campaign fair? I’d say mostly no, but there are some things that Google could do to improve things.' ITProPortal pointed out that Microsoft's own privacy policies say that the company's services 'may include the display of personalised content and advertising.' But on the Scroogled site Microsoft claims it only scans email to detect spam and other security related purposes. 'Just like the postal service sorts and scans mail and packages for dangerous explosives and biohazards, Outlook.com scans your mail to help prevent spam, gray mail, phishing scams, viruses, malware,' the site says. 'Microsoft and its email services... do not use the content of customers' private emails, communications, or documents to target advertising.' Google's privacy policy says it also 'scans the text of Gmail messages in order to filter spam and detect viruses, just as all major webmail services do.' However, it adds, 'Google also uses this scanning technology to deliver targeted text ads and other related information. This is completely automated and involves no humans.'","Latest attack is part of the software company's Scroogled campaign .

Over 20 cars from a Union Pacific freight train derailed Sunday afternoon just east of Lawtell, LA., resulting in the evacuation of all homes within a mile of the accident and the closure of area roads to protect against exposure to hazardous chemicals leaking from the wreck. The train was carrying a variety of toxic chemicals including lubricant oil, Dodecanol, vinyl chloride and Lye. Derailed: Over 20 cars came off the tracks, possibly leaking hazardous chemicals . The derailment, which happened just before 3:30pm Sunday, claimed between 23 and 26 of the train’s 76 total cars, according to KATC. Of those that derailed, 14 are carrying harmful or toxic substances. Of those 14, three are leaking – one is leaking lubricant oil, another is leaking Doecanol, and a third is leaking Lye. ‘The good news is that right now, there are no fatalities and no injuries,’ Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said during a press briefing near the site of the accident roughly 60 miles west of Baton Rouge, LA. Closed: The road that parallels the train tracks has been closed until further notice . While Lubricant oil and Dodecanol – a tasteless, colorless alcohol – are relatively harmless, Lye is highly corrosive and poses an immediate danger. ‘The cars that derailed include lube oil and other products. There was some vinyl chloride on there,"" Union Pacific spokesperson Raquel Espinoza told KATC. Two other cars carrying vinyl chloride – a highly toxic, flammable and carcinogenic substance – are damaged, but it is not clear if they are leaking. ‘Although it's not leaking at this moment, it does have signs of damage,’ Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal of the cars containing vinyl chloride, adding that the damage has to be assessed before residents can return home during a press briefing near the site of the accident. From miles around: Emergency responders from all over the county responded to the wreck . ‘Vinyl chloride is a colorless organic gas with a mild, sweet odor,’ according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Used in making plastics and vinyl, exposure to the toxin can result in symptoms ranging from irritation in the eyes and respiratory tract to liver problems, cancer, birth defects and reproductive problems, according to the government agency. As a precaution, all 101 homes within a mile of the derailment have been evacuated, officials announced. ‘Anytime you have chemicals leaking into the environment, that's a serious issue,’ Jindal said. ‘Nobody knows the extent of the damage, we'll get that in the next 24 hours.’ Roads near the site are expected to be closed for at least two days, according to reports.","Lubricant oil, Dodecanol, vinyl chloride and Lye are among the toxic chemicals on the train .

Gu Kailai was handed a suspended death sentence yesterday for murdering British businessman Neil Heywood. However, in a bizarre twist, there was fevered speculation that it wasn’t her in the dock. China was yesterday abuzz with the suggestion that the politician’s wife employed a ‘lookalike’ to take her place in court. Scroll down to watch the sentencing . Doppelganger? Gu Kailai facing the court during her sentencing yesterday, left, and right, pictured in 2007 . Gu looked plumper than before – in . contrast to most Chinese prisoners who lose weight in jail – and experts . claimed the woman who appeared for sentencing could not be the real . accused. Two security experts ‘familiar with . facial recognition software’ said that the person shown in state . television footage of the courtroom was not Gu. Pictures showed her wearing a white . shirt and black suit in the dock, where she stood calmly and praised the . guilty verdict against her. ‘I feel the verdict is just and fully . reflects the court’s special respect for the law, its special respect . for reality and, in particular, its special respect for life,’ she said. She apologised for the ‘great losses . to the [Communist] party and the country, for which I ought to shoulder . the responsibility’ and described the case as a ‘huge stone weighing on . me for more than half a year’. Chinese state security yesterday . blocked the term ‘body double’ being searched after the suggestion . spread like wildfire on the internet. Though it may seem far-fetched, . the use of a body double by the rich and powerful in China to take their . place in courtrooms has been well documented. Facing trial: Gu Kailai, 52, and aide Zhang Xiaojun, 33, are escorted into the Hefei City People's Court . No contest: During the trial Gu and Zhang did not raise any objections that on November 13, 2011, they went to Heywood's hotel room and, after getting him drunk, administered a fatal poison . The court room in Hefei, Anhui province was packed with people listening to hear the fate of the murderer. She avoided the death penalty . If true, the real Gu, 53, could  have . done a deal with Communist Party chiefs and be spending her time under . house arrest in far  more comfortable surroundings than a jail. Gu’s execution was suspended for two . years, meaning that unless she commits any further offence she will be . spared the bullet. She – or her double – faces a life sentence, which in . reality is about 14 years, with some experts predicting the sentence . could eventually be reduced even further with behind-the-scenes deals. Gu was convicted of murdering Old . Harrovian Mr Heywood with cyanide after luring him to a hotel room in . Chongqing, southwestern China, last November. Foreign media were barred from the court. Afterwards, a court spokesman said . that Gu’s sentence had  been reduced because the judges believed Mr . Heywood had ‘used threatening words’. A police officer stands guard outside Hefei Intermediate People's Court today. TV cameras were set up outside awaiting the sentencing of Gu Kailai . Keeping watch: In heightened security conditions, to police officers stand behind tape in bushes close to the court ready to pounce at the first sign of trouble . The court also found Gu’s actions reflected a ‘psychological impairment’ but did not elaborate. During Gu’s one-day trial two weeks . ago, the court was told Mr Heywood allegedly threatened to ‘destroy’ her . British-educated playboy son, Bo Guagua, 24, unless he was paid . £13million. Under threat: An undated photo of businessman Neil Heywood who was murdered in November last year . The sum was supposedly a 10 per cent . commission on a vaguely described £130million property deal that went . sour between  Mr Heywood and Mr Bo, whom he had once mentored to win a . place at Harrow. Gu is the wife of Bo Xilai, a rising . Communist Party star tipped to rule China until his wife was accused of . murder. He is now under house arrest while his fate is decided. Chinese propagandists say Gu had a . ‘wolfish appetite for sex’ and that MI6 pressed Mr Heywood to seduce her . to prise communist secrets from her. Friends of Mr Heywood, a . 41-year-old who lived in Beijing with his wife Lulu and their two young . children, describe the claims he had an affair with Gu as preposterous. Micro-bloggers believe the government . used a stand-in for Gu at the trial because her appearance has changed . so radically since she has been in custody. Some are blaming her puffy appearance on the medication used to treat her ‘mental state’, though few are convinced. In 2009, a Chinese hospital president . who caused a deadly traffic accident hired an employee’s father to . ‘confess’ and serve as his stand-in. In another case, after hitting and . killing a motorcyclist, a man driving without a licence hired a . substitute for £5,000. The practice is so common that there . is even a term for it – ding zui.

New hobby: Wheelchair bound Pascale found all the things she loved doing she 'couldn't do anymore' - but was able to surf for the first time thanks to Tyron . All aboard: She is strapped to Tyron's back using duct tape . Secure: The technique has been perfected so she has no danger of slipping . He said: 'When we first came up with the idea, I . thought ""I wonder if you can surf on the same board? I could duct tape . you to my back and surf, I don't see why not.""' He added he enjoyed seeing if the balancing act could be done. 'If I can do what I normally do with 40 extra kilos, it's pretty good challenge, really,' he said. The video, shot by Mark Tipple, follows Pascale as she is strapped to Tyron's back using tape and they head into the ocean. Heading into the waves: Pascale said she hopes her story inspires others to believe their dreams can come true . In the surf club: Now Pascale can join her sons as they pursue their favourite hobby . The camera tracks the pair as Tyron jumps into position on the surf board and rides the waves with Pascale clinging on with a beaming smile. She recalls the wonder she felt the first time she took to the water with Tyron: 'I remember looking up, the colour, the sound, being part of everything, being part of the water, I can't find . words to explain it.' She added that surfing with Tyron allows her to join in with her sons as they pursue their favourite hobby and feel like she can stand again. 'Being taped there at the same height, I felt like it was me,' she said. Under the sea: Pascale can even go scuba diving with Tyron . Hope: The pair, who live in Australia, are delighted their story has inspired others around the world . Tyron said he didn't realise how their story could touch so many people until word of their unusual surf pairing spread across the globe. 'It's changed her life in a way I think,' he said. 'I didn't think about it too much until people started saying how much it inspired them.' Pascale said she hopes her experience can encourage other people to never give up hope. She said: 'It's shown me you can still have a dream and things are possible... concentrate on the positive in life.'

A Venezuelan man who lost his arm in a motorcycle accident has built his own prosthesis after finding out he was to become a father. Angel Sanguino, from Caracas, built an ingenious robotic arm that allows him to perform a series of useful tasks and resume his career as an electronics technician to provide for his family. A doctor had advised Mr Sanguino to accept his disability, but he instead built his own prosthesis to carry on with this old life and win a prize for science, technology and innovation. Scroll down for video... A Venezuelan electrician who lost his arm in a motorcycle accident, has built his own prosthesis using domestic materials after finding out he was to become a father . The 33-year-old was riding his motorbike last year when he was hit by a speeding car competing in an illegal street race, Oddity Central reported. Mr Sanguino was rushed to the emergency room, but doctors had to amputate his left arm from the shoulder. He also suffered severe internal organ damage and fractured legs. The amputation operation was . particularly traumatic as it was clear that the electronics technician, . who worked for a computer part manufacturer, would not be able to . continue doing his job with one arm. Angel Sanguino's arm has a clamp for holding objects so that he can grip electronic items in need of repair, as well as a magnifying glass and lighting so he can repair fiddly components more easily and earn a living . While an orthopedist told Mr Sanguino that he should come to terms with his disability and move on with life in a new way, he had other ideas. When lying in intensive care recovering from his injuries, Mr Sanguino learned he would soon become a father, which made him determined to provide for his new family. Just three months after his accident, Mr Sanguino designed a prosthetic arm that would allow him to repair electrical components and earn a living as he did before. He created his robotic arm with the help of his orthopedist uncle, Brunel Rodriguez, who provided the essential parts to build the prosthesis. Mr Sanguino . used his electronics expertise to ensure the arm performed the . functions he needed to allow him to resume his job without anyone else's . help. Angel Sanguino, from Caracas, built an ingenious robotic arm that allows him to perform a series of useful tasks and resume his career as an electronics technician to provide for his family . Although the arm looks rather basic, it has a number of switches and sensors that allow  Mr Sanguino to control it with the movement around his collarbone. It . also has a clamp for holding objects so that he can grip electronic . items in need of repair, as well as a magnifying glass and lighting so . he can fix fiddly components more easily. Before his accident,   Mr Sanguino used to mend six mobile phones every day. With the help of his new prostheses, he can fix four, but plans on upgrading his arm to help boost his productivity. Mr Sanguino's . home made robotic arm cost between 2,000 and 5,000 bolivars - between . £200 and £500 because it was largely built from domestic materials. He said: 'I’m doing this kind of prosthesis for . me, but if one day someone wants me to make one for them, I can do it . with my eyes closed and adapt it to the way they live and work.' The robotic arm is powered by a small motor connected to a battery and has sensors connected to Mr Sanguino's collarbone to detect movements . Mr Sanguino also intends to build a more efficient wheelchair to donate to a child who needs it. The robotic arm is powered by a small motor connected to a battery, and has sensors connected to Mr Sanguino's collarbone to detect movements.

He also intends to replace the . small motor with a servomotor that will allow him to control his arm . faster and with more precision. A prosthesis costs 90,000 bolivars in Venuzuela, which is equivalent to approximately £9,500 - an amount that is too much for many people to afford.

The Lady Share House B&D, an all-female residential facility in Osaka, Japan, have established a tenancy agreement whereby rent is set based on a person's fluctuating weight: the more weight you lose, the less rent you pay. And the reverse applies, too.

Weigh less, pay less: An all-female block of flats in Japan is incentivising weight loss by charging less rent to people who weigh less . This development comes in spite of 30 per cent of women in their twenties in Japan being underweight.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:48 EST, 3 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:27 EST, 3 July 2013 . Brussels has imposed £5billion worth of new red tape on Britain in just two years, a damning new analysis reveals today. New laws, regulations and rules form Europe have cost the equivalent of £9,500 every minute since the start of 2011. The revelation sparked claims that UK families were bearing the cost of Euro diktats slipped through the ‘backdoor with little scrutiny’. Red tape: Regulations from the European Parliament and other Brussels institutions has lead to the introduction of 75 new directives estimated to cost Britain £5billion, new figures show . Around 250 new measures were introduced to Britain as a result of rules from European institutions in 2011 and 2012. Of these, 74 imposed additional costs of £5billion to taxpayers and businesses. They included more than £800million on green fuels, £250million from packaging and recycling demands and £800million forcing self-employed drivers to cut the hours they work. The biggest single cost was from regulations introduced after the European Court of Justice banned insurance companies from charging lower premiums for women drivers. The amendments to the Equality Act 2010 cost an extra £923million. The European Commission said the figures do not include the benefits of the regulations or the wider advantages of Britain's membership of the EU. But Tory MP Priti Patel, who compiled the . data, said: ‘New red tape from Europe is strangling British businesses, . placing a significant impact upon our economy and adding huge costs to . Britain’s hard-pressed families. ‘These rules are being imposed through the backdoor with little scrutiny or opportunities to amend them or scrap them.’ Environmental Permitting Regulations 2011 £80million . Waste Regulations 2011 £81.3million over 10 years . Motor Fuel and Merchant Shipping Regulations 2010 £423million over 10 years . Cleaner Road Transport Vehicles Regulations 2011 £215million over 24 years . Toys Safety Regulations 2011 £230million over 10 years . Electricity and Gas Regulations 2011 £184.1million over 21 years . Electronic Communications Order 2011 £133million . Equality Act 2010 Regulations (insurance for female drivers) 2012 £923.2 million . Packaging Waste Regulations 2012 £249.6million over 5 years . Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2011 £809million over 18 years . Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations 2012 £806million over 10 years . Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 £191.5million over 10 years . Council Regulation (residence permits for third-country nationals) £103 million . Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations 2012 £768million over 15 years . The revelation comes ahead of the first Commons debate on Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. Conservative backbencher James Wharton is using a Private Members Bill to try to legislate for a vote to be held by the end of 2017, but Labour and the Lib Dems are opposed to the idea. Ms Patel added: ‘The British people are fed up with Europe’s unaccountable bureaucrats and judges meddling in their way of life and expect MPs to stand up for the British interest by voting for a referendum on our membership of the EU. ‘In advance of the referendum, ministers throughout Government need to do more to stop this country being blackmailed by Europe’s unaccountable bureaucratic elite.’ Ms Patel tabled a series of parliamentary questions asking every government department which regulations they had been forced to introduce by Europe. She then analysed official impact assessments to put a price tag on each measure, which revealed the £5billion cost in just two years. The order to force self-employed drivers to comply with Working Time rules was imposed at a cost of £806million over 10 years, despite the government admitting ‘evidence suggest that no problem exists in the UK regarding road safety and self-employed drivers’. A spokesman for the European Commission said: 'First, the Commission only ever proposes legislation where its impact assessment clearly shows that overall benefits – not reflected in Ms Patel’s figures -outweigh the cost. 'The UK supported most of the regulations listed so clearly came to the same conclusion - that benefits outweighed costs. 'For example, most jurisdictions – UK, EU and worldwide - agree that there should be strong rules on hazardous substances and toy safety, even if it costs manufacturers money to minimise the risk that their products kill or maim children. 'The UK government (BiS) has estimated  the benefits deriving from the single market alone at up to £92billion every year, therefore a huge multiple of Ms Patel’s debatable figure for the alleged costs of Regulation.' Mr Cameron has promised to . renegotiate a 'fresh settlement' with Brussels if he is Prime Minister . after the 2015 election, before holding an in-out referendum . Mr . Wharton's Bill, drawn up by Tory HQ, says that a referendum ‘must be . held before 31 December 2017’, and says a Cabinet minister must bring . forward parliament orders which name the date by the end of 2016. Clash: David Cameron has promised an in-out referendum after reaching a new deal with Brussels but Nick Clegg dismissed the Tory policy of an ‘ill-defined process of so-called renegotiation’ Law: Tory MP James Wharton will lead a debate on his Bill in the Commons on Friday . But . a briefing paper by the House of Commons library says it means the . legislation as it stands is not legally binding and more parliamentary . votes will be needed on ‘the detailed rules for the poll and the date’. The issue has caused a major . coalition row, with the Prime Minister claiming Nick Clegg's Lib Dems . 'have to get off the fence' and back giving the British public a say. But . this week Mr Clegg said that he thought Britain was best placed in the . EU and the Liberal Democrats are the ‘the party of in'. Mean while the Tories were ‘increasingly becoming the party of out’. Mr Clegg claimed the Conservative position has ‘swerved around enormously in recent months and years, noting that Mr Cameron’s ‘cast-iron pledge’ to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty had not been kept. He dismissed Mr Cameron's ‘ill-defined process of so-called renegotiation’, accusing him of plucking the 2017 date out of thin air. The coalition had already legislated to ensure that there would be an in-out referendum the next time there was a major EU Treaty. Critic: Tory MP Priti Patel, who compiled the figures, said European red tape is strangling British businesses . Britain’s national interest is not being served by our current membership of the European Union. This unaccountable and bureaucratic juggernaut, driven by its dogmatic commitment to ‘ever closer union’, has gained an insatiable appetite for crushing national democracies and circumventing democracy. Throughout the laws which affect hardworking families and business we can see the carnage that Europe’s bureaucrats and judges have caused. Ridiculous laws have hit our economy hard and are stifling growth and job creation. The Working Time Directive prevents the NHS from treating patients. Green energy rules are adding billions of pounds to energy bills. £5 billion of new regulatory costs have been burdened on this country in the last two years. While we have lost control of our immigration system and been compelled to accept millions of new foreigners and asylum seekers into Britain, taxpayers have been forced to stump up £19.2 billion a year to fill the EU’s bloated coffers. The EU is not the peace-loving, free trade paradise sold to the British people in the 1970s. It is an organisation desperate to drain more powers from nation states and, as we have seen with the Eurozone crisis, dictate how countries should be run. The President of the European Commission has made no secret of his wish to see Europe even more tightly integrated, under the auspices of the Commission. Britain cannot afford to be dragged . more closely into Europe’s orbit it is the responsibility of Parliament . to exercise its sovereignty and facilitate the repatriation of powers . through a referendum. Just as the British people have been . proven to make the right decisions about how they should be governed in . the past, they should be trusted to do so in the future. They should be able to decide who . makes the laws that affect them and be trusted to pass their judgement . on the control the EU exerts on our immigration system, farming and . fisheries policies. Now is the time to let the people . decide whether they wish to reject membership of the European Union and . instead reaffirm the principle that British laws should be made by . British people in Britain. This is why Friday’s vote on in the . House of Commons on the EU Referendum Bill is so important and has the . potential to be a defining moment in the history of British democracy. Members of Parliament have an opportunity to send out a powerful and decisive statement to the public and to the European Union about how Britain should be governed. With a strong turnout in Parliament and vote in support of the Bill, Britain will be one step closer to putting to an end four decades of centralisation and power-grabbing by Europe’s political elite. But, despite this opportunity to empower the British people, it is shameful that Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs are planning to abstain. The fact that the two parties who conspired five years ago to deny us the referendum promised on the Lisbon Treaty still do not trust the British people to decide is not surprising. But it is astounding that when we live in an era where referendums have become commonplace and are used to decide everything from endorsing a local neighbourhood development plan to changing the Parliamentary voting system that Labour and Lib Dems dub this referendum a ‘stunt’ and ‘gimmick’. Only those afraid to put their arguments in favour of the European Union to the people would hold them in such contempt. As well as facing the disparaging attitude of Labour and the Lib Dems, those who back a referendum have received a hostile reception from the European Commission and its President. They prefer to scaremonger the public. But those in Britain and in Europe who stand in the way of letting the British people decide their own destiny are on the wrong side of the argument.","Study by Tory MP Priti Patel uncovers 250 new rules in 2011 and 2012 .

A UKIP candidate is facing calls to resign after claiming the solution to crime in Britain is sharia law and thieves should have their hands cut off. Self-employed builder and UKIP activist Dean Perks, prospective candidate for Halesowen and Rowley Regis, shocked supporters at a rally when he suggested the brutal punishment as a legitimate way to tackle crime. Mr Perks is due to stand for the party at the next general election but leader Nigel Farage is now facing a barrage of calls to get rid of him. Controversial: Dean Perks, pictured on a video from his YouTube channel, is facing calls to resign after claiming sharia law works at preventing crime . Speaking at a meeting with supporters in Coventry, West Midlands, earlier this year Mr Perks made the shocking claims. He said: 'In my opinion, sharia law works as a prevention - and prevention is better than cure. 'If you think you are going to get your hand chopped off for pinching something, you won't pinch it. 'I recently had a conversation with someone who asked what I thought of Sharia law. 'I said: ""Well in all honesty, I do agree with part - but by no means all - of sharia law"". That's my view - my opinion. I ain't going to defend myself. I do agree with it. 'Sharia law, in my opinion, works as a prevention.' The potential candidate is no stranger to controversy, earlier this year he faced a backlash when he praised the Enoch Powell, claiming he was 'well liked in the Asian community' and labelling him 'a visionary'. He was also forced to admit calling someone 'retarded' via social network Twitter. UKIP leader Nigel Farage, left, is now facing calls to make Mr Perks, right, stand down over his comments . The controversies were a far cry from a statement he gave on launching his campaign, claiming he would never bad mouth other candidates. In launching his campaign for the hotly contested Halesowen and Rowley Regis seat, Mr Perks said: 'I hope to show people a new type of politician. 'It is not my intention to bad mouth or attack any other candidates as I believe we should all be in the running for the same purpose.' However on he was involved in the ugly Twitter spat which resulted him writing: 'I just asked the question but he will not answer, I think he may be retarded.' This followed on from an argument with Labour councillor Dave Branwood who asked Mr Perks whether he thought Enoch Powell, whose 1968 Rivers of Blood speech caused his own downfall, was racist. Mr Perks replied: 'No. It's a fact he was very well liked amongst the Asian community. I'd say he was a visionary.' This led to anti-facist, left wing politicians, including Dudley North Ian Austin MP and several other outraged Twitter users to round on Mr Perks calling him racist. However, Mr Perks, denied he is racist. While Mr Perks admits he believes sharia law works, he insisted he was against it being introduced in the UK . He said: 'I have never studied Enoch Powell. I'm not racist because I'm not afraid to have an opinion. I have a Muslim godson, a Sikh brother-in-law and three mixed race cousins.' Now he is facing more calls to resign from MPs. John Spellar, Labour MP for Warley, said the comments were typical of the party. He said: 'Once again this shows the bizarre sort of candidate that UKIP is attracting. 'People from all communities will be astonished and appalled that Mr Perks want to bring such barbarity into Britain.' 'The real question is how did he ever get to be a candidate in the first place. I challenge Nigel Farage to throw him out immediately.' Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said: 'Sharia law can only be applied in Muslim states. 'There is no way sharia law could be introduced in the UK and Muslims who live in countries where there isn't a predominance of Muslims, like here, follow the law of the land. 'Mr Perks seems to be very confused, you can't pick and chose with sharia law, you either believe in all of it, or none of it' Mr Perks did not make clear which parts of sharia law he agrees and disagrees with and could not be contacted for comment yesterday. But on his Twitter page he insisted he is 'against sharia law in the UK'.

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 03:53 EST, 11 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:02 EST, 11 April 2013 . Innovative: Tim Waterstone is reintroducing serialised novels to readers in the form of e-books . The serialised novel, made famous by Victorian authors such as Charles Dickens, could be about to make an unlikely comeback - in digital form. The founder of Waterstones is capitalising on the success of e-books to launch a new company offering short stories, journalism and extracts from longer books, aimed at users of mobile devices. Read Petite will use a subscription-based model to attract customers, prompting comparisons to Spotify, but unlike the music streaming service it will be heavily curated in a bid to avoid a 'slush pile' of mediocre material. Tim Waterstone, 73, has already revolutionised the High Street by introducing a national chain of high-quality bookshops for the discerning reader. Now he hopes to do the same for the online world as well, re-introducing the art of the serialised novel and other neglected forms. As paperback books became increasingly common and affordable throughout the 20th century, short stories and long-form journalism fell in popularity. But now many people are believed to do most of their reading on tablets and e-readers while commuting on public transport, leading to a new hunger for more easily digestible reading material. 'It worked for Dickens and it worked for us,' Mr Waterstone told the Daily Telegraph. 'If you are going to read on a laptop or a smartphone or a tablet, it is about as much as you want.' Venture: Read Petite, which is launching in the autumn, will offer a curated service of short-form literature . Dickens and his peers, such as Anthony Trollope, published most of their novels in serialised form via monthly magazines before issuing the complete hardback versions. The opportunities for cliffhangers provided by serialisation provoked intense public interest - famously, New Yorkers flocked to the city's harbour to meet the boat carrying the final chapters of The Old Curiosity Shop in order to find out whether the novel's heroine Little Nell would survive. The material published by Read Petite will be closely scrutinised by Mr Waterstone and his partners in order to ensure a high level of literary quality. 'The whole point is to avoid a slush pile of material,' he told the Guardian. 'What we'll guarantee is quality writing.' They hope to attract established authors with a pre-existing fanbase, but will largely publish new works which have not appeared elsewhere. Pioneer: Charles Dickens, pictured reading to his daughters at home, published his books in sections . The service, which will open to subscribers in the autumn, is likely to cost around £5-12 per month. Mr Waterstone, who founded the company that bears his name in 1982 and left in 2001, has previously attempted to sell short fiction, but found it too difficult in the pre-digital era. His is not the only bid to reinvigorate the book industry in the face of competition from Amazon and the supermarket giants. Last month, Waterstones announced plans to include an extra chapter in the paperback edition of Joanne Harris' Peaches for Monsieur le Curé, the sequel to her best-seller Chocolat. They hope the bonus offering will entice readers away from e-books and cheaper retailers.","Tim Waterstone launches Read Petite, subscription service for e-books .

They shared countless cups of tea, dinner parties and Christmases over decades spent living in the same street. So when John and Clare Boots decided to move to a new estate two miles away from their house in Newport, Wales - breaking up the three families' close-knit circle - their neighbours followed right behind. Now the Boots, their friends Steve and Mary Parker, and Jane Jones and her partner Mark Watkins say they feel like they've 'won the lottery' after they all moved into neighbouring houses on the new development. Everybody needs good neighbours: Steve and Mary Parker (left), their sons Gareth and Owain (behind), Jane Jones (centre), and Clare and John Boots (right) are all neighbours once again on a new street . There to lend a hand: When Mr and Mrs Boots decided to move to a new development less than two miles away in Newport, their neighbours followed right behind them . When the Boots moved into a house in the Bryn 20 years ago, they became fast friends with Steve and Mary, who have two sons, Gareth and Owain, and had been living in the property two doors down for 28 years. The close-knit group expanded to include Jane Jones, who had been living in the Bryn for 22 years, and her partner Mark Watkins when he moved in 10 years ago. 'We all just gelled,' Mr Boots said. 'We were never in each others' pockets, just always there for each other. 'There . have been tears and laughter. My father recently passed away and Mark . has had heart problems and we'd all been a support system. 'We . all loved that old-fashioned neighbourhood set-up.

Love thy neighbour: This aerial shot of the families' old cul-de-sac in Newport shows their neighbouring properties . Where it all began: The three families had been living at The Bryn in Newport for a combined total of 70 years . Fresh start: The friendships they forged over the years look set to continue after they all moved to the new development at Westfield Rise . But after many happy years at the Bryn, Mr Boots handed his wife his credit card and told her to 'buy something nice'. Mrs Boots set her heart on a new home at the nearby development in Westfield Rise, and the couple set about breaking the news to their friends. 'We were ready to move, it was the next step,' Mr Boot said. 'It's such a beautiful house, the price was right and the move was so smooth - we'd do it all again.' Mark and Jane put an offer in on a house three doors down to the Boots' new property within a week, and within six months the Parkers snapped up the house next door. Close-knit: The others couldn't bear to have their circle broken up when Mr and Mrs Boots decided to move house . Among friends: The Boots' old house in the Bryn is seen on the left, with their neighbours the Parkers' old home on the right . Reunited: The three families are now neighbours once again, living in a row of houses on Westfield Rise . The three couples are now neighbours once again in the cul-de-sac, recreating the sense of community they enjoyed in their old road. Mr Boots said: 'I've been back and forth mowing the lawn for them in preparation and we're planning a big house-warming. It's made us even closer - we all finish each other's sentences. 'The Parkers and us look after each others' gardens and if I'm outside cutting the grass it can take me hours because we're all chatting.' Despite living in such close quarters for so many years, Mr Boots insists their has never been a quarrel between the families. 'We've never fallen out, and I honestly don't think we ever will,' he said. 'We're friends for life. When the others told us they wanted to live here too, it was like we'd won the lottery.' Denise Swift, sales manager for Bellway Homes, said: 'It's fantastic that the three sets of families have all decided to relocate together at Westfield Rise.

But even the most ostentatious Muscovite might find the gold bodice and body paint get-up that appeared at Moscow Fashion Week last night a touch over the top. The brainchild of British designer duo, Fyodor Golan, the odd creation was one of the most outrageous looks from the fashion event so far. It wasn't the only bizarre outfit to appear on the catwalk either, with everything from lilac lace face masks to ammonite-inspired collars cropping up on the runway. Going for gold: Fyodor Golan's bling bodice was one of Moscow Fashion Weeks's oddest looks so far . Bizarre: The British duo also sent this extremely odd look down the catwalk during their Moscow show . Fyodor Golan came up trumps with another strange look, which included a lilac and blue lace face-covering hat, teamed with yet another bodice and a spangled all in one. But although the British pair led the brash pack, they had plenty of competition from homegrown designers. Designer Gera Skandal lived up to her name, taking Spiderman as her inspiration and sending a succession of eccentric sheer monochrome jumpsuits down the runway. Other male models to suffer from the creative whims of local designers included the chaps at Ekaterina Sidelnikova, who sent her long-suffering runway stars down the catwalk in odd modern caveman type creations, and those at TaiDo, who wore fur coats with what looked like a deluxe version of a dog collar. Hero to zero: Gera Skandal created a buzz with her weird Spiderman style sheer jumpsuits . Long-suffering: TaiDo's collar and coat combo, and Ekaterina Sidelnikova's modern caveman .

Show stopper: Ukrainian actress Olga Kurylenko showed Moscow's fashionistas how its done . The girls didn't escape the weirdness either, with Ruban sending models out in chic tailored dresses teamed with bizarre gnome-like hats. Equally odd were the bouffant fringes at Pirosmani which looked witchy peeking out from voluminous black hooded capes. Meanwhile, Ekaterina Vasilieva appeared to take inspiration from ammonite fossils, with a strange set of collars that strongly resembled the prehistoric mollusc. But not every look was a bad one. Gold body paint aside, the rest of Fyodor Golan's collection included some wonderfully wearable dresses, among them a standout red brocade shift. Taya Dodina's wonderful pansy photo prints were good enough to be confused with Erdem, while Tatiana Sulimina offered up a collection crammed with delicate maxi dresses. Also worth a second look was Dasha Gauser's riff on monochrome that resulted in quirky black and white candy stripes splashed on everything from boots to coats. But even Gauser couldn't hold a candle to the truly fashionable Olga Kurlyenko, who wowed the Muscovite fashion pack with her bold choices at the Moscow premiere of Oblivion. Appearing with co-star, Tom Cruise, the Ukrainian actress' wardrobe choices included a stunning dusty blue lace dress and a flattering deep purple printed coat.

Cowboy builder Patrick Feeney 'milked people for all they were worth' and was jailed for fraud and acquiring criminal property . A cowboy builder who boasted of being 'the top man in town' has been jailed for five years after overcharging confused pensioners by up to 600 per cent for his botched construction jobs. Patrick Feeney, 49, targeted the elderly over a 15 year period pestering them to do building work at their homes then exploiting their vulnerability to hit them with vastly inflated bills and demand they pay in cash. Two of his victims, including a 91-year-old, were escorted to the bank so they could hand over the money after being harassed for cash. Another victim, an 81-year-old man was taken to a DIY warehouse to pay for materials and looked so frail and petrified, staff asked him if he wanted to sit down. In his latest scam Feeney claimed £27,000 for work which was worth £6,000, £6,130 for building work worth about £1,000 and £2,090 for work worth £599. During his reign of misery Feeney was on the run in Spain for three years where he hid from the authorities. He later claimed he had frittered the money away on a £200 pounds a day cocaine habit. At Burnley Crown Court Feeney, of Colne, Lancashire, admitted three charges of fraud and one of acquiring criminal property. He faces a Proceeds of Crime hearing later. Passing sentence Judge Graham Knowles QC told Feeney: 'You show not only a complete lack of humanity but also a complete contempt for your victims. Feeney would pester his victims to do building work at their homes then land them with vastly inflated bills and demand they pay in cash . 'Elderly, frail, confused and vulnerable . people, whose ranks you may one day join, should be respected, should be . cared for and should be protected. But you preyed upon them. 'You milked people for all they were worth and used every technique that you found convenient. 'You are a practised liar who has lived a thoroughly criminal life. It is said you are remorseful, but I have to take a cautious view of that when it comes from your lips.' Feeney first came to the attention of police in 1998 when he ran PNF Building and three of his employees had done some work on the home of an 88-year-old disabled woman who lived on her own for 27 years. The value of the work was £4,500, but Feeney got the woman to part with £11,427. He subsequently stole £900 from another old woman aged 84 when he had done some work for her and went asking for payment. He later declared to be 'the top man in Colne.' But in August of that year he was locked up for three years and nine months for fraud. He locked up again in 2007 for four years for further deceptions and was just out of jail on parole licence when he committed the latest offences in July 2009. He jumped bail in that same year and fled to Spain before agreeing to return to the UK last year when a European Arrest Warrant was issued for him. In mitigation defence lawyer Mr Richard Simons said his client 'showed genuine remorse' and apologised. The barrister added: ' It does not appear that the money was used to facilitate a luxury lifestyle.'","Patrick Feeney branded a 'practised liar who milked people' by judge .

Elie Taktouk, 38, whose former wife, Daniella Semaan, gave birth to Fabregas' baby in April, tried to block the sale on the basis that the Barcelona star's offer was £2m less than its true value. The Grade-II listed Belgravia flat, just yards from Buckingham Palace, had been ordered for sale as part of divorce proceedings, in order to provide money for Miss Semaan to buy her own home. But in an 'extraordinary' twist, Mr Taktouk soon learned it was her new boyfriend, the multi-millionaire footballer, who had put an offer on the table within three weeks of the flat going on the market. After the sale to Fabregas was approved by the High Court, Mr Taktouk launched a last-ditch bid for time to look for a bid closer to his £7.5m valuation of the apartment, where his ex was still living. But after a Court of Appeal hearing, the footballer and his Lebanese girlfriend ran out winners when Lord Justice Floyd threw out Mr Taktouk's application to block the sale to the former Arsenal captain. Miss Semaan's claimed - in a witness statement read out by the judge - that, if she stays in London, she will not even be able to live in the flat when it is signed over to her boyfriend. Quoting 38-year-old Miss Semaan, who the court heard hopes to move to Spain, the judge said: 'Once the former matrimonial home is sold, I will have no accommodation in London. Coincidence? Fabregas (left), with Daniella Semaan, will now be able to buy the Grade-II listed Belgravia flat . Exclusive: A view of the central London street where the flat at the centre of the dispute is situated . 'If the property is sold to Mr Fabregas, it is my understanding that it will be used as an investment and rented out in order to cover the cost of the purchase, and/or generate some income.' After the divorce proceedings, the sale of the couple's flat was put into Miss Semaan's hands by the High Court and the £5.475m sale to Fabregas was agreed, Lord Justice Floyd said. But, on appeal, Mr Taktouk's barrister, Stephen Lyon, argued that there was clear evidence of several other interested parties, who were willing to pay much more but have been unable to view the flat while she is in it. 'There's credible prima facie evidence that this property can sell, and sell quickly, for a sum in the region of £7.5 million,' he said. 'There are five parties, all of whom . have had absolutely no connection with the husband or his family, who . have expressed interest in purchasing this property at £7.5m and all of . whom have requested access for viewings, and all of whom are described . by the proposed agents as being serious offers.' But, . rejecting his case, the appeal judge said encouraging more offers would . be a breach of the contract of sale already agreed with Fabregas, and . that, while unsold, the £4.8 million mortgage is accruing interest of . £1,000-a-day. Mr Taktouk previously objected to having to shell out for a home for his ex-wife as her new boyfriend Cesc Fabregas, who is thought to earn £5m-a-year, has millions to lavish on her . Mr Taktouk had not objected to a sale of the flat to his mother, Mary Taktouk, for a price similar to that being offered by the footballer, he continued. 'The strongest point which Mr Lyon makes is that the judge appeared at times to proceed on the basis that the necessary consequence of allowing the sale of the flat to Mr Fabregas will be that the family could remain in the flat,' he continued. 'The passage I have read from the wife's statement could be read as suggesting that there is, in fact, no prospect of that solution being the case. 'I am by no means convinced that that is the position. If the sale goes through to Mr Fabregas, there will be a real possibility that the children will remain in the flat, in their home, and that remains a powerful factor in favour of allowing the sale to go ahead.' He rejected Mr Taktouk's application for a stay on the sale, meaning it can now go ahead. Mr Taktouk and his ex-wife married when they were 24 and living in Lebanon. They had two children before their separation in 2011, months after Miss Semaan was seen on holiday with the 25-year-old footballer. Mr Taktouk had previously objected to having to shell out for a home for his ex-wife in circumstances where her new boyfriend, who is thought to earn £5m-a-year, has millions to lavish on her. In a court hearing in April, he claimed she had significantly under-stated the financial support she would get from Fabregas. She said his only obligation was to support their child and all she got was the price of flights, presents and being looked after when she is in Spain. Her evidence led family judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, to rule that the flat be sold. The proceeds, with a top-up from Mr Taktouk, would provide her with the £1.4m she needed to find a home of her own.","Elie Taktouk's ex-wife, Daniella Semaan, gave birth to Fabregas' baby in April .

Struggling pensioners are selling their homes and moving to rented accommodation to pay off debts. Two-fifths of retirees who rent once owned a home. Financial concerns – such as the cost of divorce or separation – were given as the main reason for stepping off the property ladder. Many of them have been forced to sell up to pay off debts or boost their income, the Prudential said. Crisis: Many pensioners are being forced to sell their homes and move to rented accommodation to pay debts . Financial concerns were given as the main motivation for stepping off the property ladder for the 42 per cent of renting retirees who used to own their own home. The study found that around one quarter (25 per cent) of retirees rent their home and nearly three quarters of them (73 per cent) plan to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The most common reasons for former home owners to have sold their property to move into the rental sector was that they had debts to pay or needed to cover the cost of a divorce or separation. One in 11 (9 per cent) former property owners said they had sold their home to boost their retirement income. The findings come at a time when rents have soared following strong demand in the sector. Research by the Prudential building society found that retired renters pay £423 a month in rent typically, compared with £257 a month on average for retirees who still have mortgages . Prudential found that retired renters pay £423 a month in rent typically, compared with £257 a month on average for retirees who still have mortgages. Prudential previously found that people retiring this year expect to have an income of around £15,300 a year, meaning average rental costs would take up around one third of this sum at just over £5,000. Fears have recently been raised for people in the later stages of their working lives who are sitting on an interest-only mortgage 'time bomb'. They may be forced to sell their homes if they do not have a proper plan in place to pay their loans back once the deal comes to an end. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently sounded a 'wake up call' to borrowers and told them they must be prepared to communicate with lenders to work out what steps to take. Up to 1.3 million interest-only customers do not have enough cash to pay their loans back. Almost one in six (15 per cent) of retired renters choose not to own their home as a lifestyle choice, while 35 per cent could not afford to raise a deposit, the Prudential research found. Stan Russell, senior pensions business development manager at Prudential, said: 'Renting in retirement can make financial sense and accessing property wealth to boost retirement income is a genuine solution for many. Our research shows that many retired renters are perfectly happy with this arrangement. 'However, retirees should be aware of the extra financial burden they could be taking on if they choose to sell up and rent. 'The fact that some retirees say they are being forced to sell up purely by the need to pay off debts is concerning and suggests they are not receiving professional advice. Organisations like the Money Advice Service and Citizens Advice offer free advice and can help enormously.' Around 740 people who are retired took part in the research across the UK.","Prudential study finds that around one quarter .

Rumours are circulating that Sony is preparing to launch its next generation games console soon after the Japanese tech giant sent out invitations to an event on 'the future of PlayStation.' Sony would not say whether it was preparing to unveil the successor to the 70million selling PS3 at the February 20 meeting in New York, but the prospect had gamers abuzz on Twitter. 'We will be talking about the PlayStation business,' Sony spokesman Masaki Tsukakoshi said today. Tantalising: A still from the video Sony released to drum up excitement over its PlayStation announcement . Despite that, the scale of the excitement over the meeting was indicated by a Google search for 'Sony Feb 20 PlayStation' which returned more than 7million hits. The last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011, it presented a protoype of its handheld Vita console. Before that, it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the PS3 concept. A meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the PS2. It has been more than six years since Sony launched the PS3 home console, a longer gap than between it and its PS2 predecessor, adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept. Current generation: Sony's super-slim . PlayStation 3 has been on the market for more than six years, selling some 70million units, making the . Japanese technology firm long overdue a new flagship product launch . Despite remaining tight-lipped about the specific purpose of the press conference, the company published a teaser video about the meeting on YouTube which has already been viewed more than 400,000 times in less than 24 hours. The video also promoted a Twitter hashtag, #Playstation2013, to which video game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming event.

Such a console would follow Nintendo's Wii U, which launched last autumn, and precede Microsoft's next Xbox game console, which will likely be unveiled in June at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles. The PlayStation Vita: The portable console, successor to the PSP, was unveiled the last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011 . Since Sony's last home console launch, the games market has been transformed by the boom in smartphones and tablet computers that have wooed players with free or cheap games. Sony and its video game rivals Nintendo and Microsoft now have to contend with competition from powerful hand-held devices made by Apple, Samsung and a string of others. Analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games consoles within a few years. Many are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs. Struggling under competitive pressure, Nintendo on Wednesday cut its sales target for the Wii U, successor to its 100million-selling Wii, to 4million machines by the end of March from its launch in November. That compared with an earlier forecast for 5.5million.","Tech giant sends out invites for February 20 meeting in New York .

It is a miracle that Patricia Murphy is alive. Nine months ago the 45-year-old was admitted to hospital suffering with cirrhosis of the liver as a result of drinking 350 units of alcohol every week for ten years. Patricia ended up on a life support machine, and her skin turned a grisly yellow colour due to her massive organ failure. She was given a 5% chance of survival and a priest was called to read her last rites. But she survived, and a picture taken of her at her lowest became the trigger for a turning point in her life. She is now sober, and feeling lucky to still be . alive the former sales assistant appeared on This Morning today to tell her . story and warn other women about the dangers of alcohol, the legal . substance which ruined her life. She said: 'That picture was the turning point. Seeing how yellow I was. I went through a lot, I couldn't even walk when I came off intensive care, but now it's as if the illness has been lifted from my brain.' Patricia began drinking when she was 17, after leaving school to train as a sales assistant. Naturally . shy, drinking made her feel confident among her peers, and soon she was . drinking 10 double brandy and Cokes at the weekends. She said: I was always the first one in and the last person out of the pub. If someone offered me a drink and I already had one I would always take it. I always ordered doubles. 'When I was 28 I stopped going out because I couldn't get as drunk as I wanted to. It's not normal to drink like that. It's a slippery road. I was born with the addiction. I was always going to be an alcoholic.' It was at the age of 28 that Patricia also lost both her mother and father, which sent her drinking to new, more dangerous depths. She swapped Bacardi and brandy for wine because it was easier to get drunk and made her less aggressive. She said: 'Being drunk means that you don't have to feel things, you can get oblivious. 'I have been in to rehab three times but each time I came out I would go and buy wine and drink. I didn't want to stop it, I wanted to get drunk. I liked the way it made me feel.' The 45-year-old from Chessington appeared on This Morning today to warn other women of the dangers . Soon she was drinking five bottles of . wine every day, and waking up in the middle of the night sweating and . shaking. She lost her job because she was unable to hold down any kind of routine and then used all of her benefits money to buy alcohol, and spent . all day watching TV and feeling depressed. Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous . meetings and her visits to rehab it was a visit to her local GP which saved Patricia's life. She was told that her liver was seriously damaged and immediately taken to hospital with . cirrhosis where she collapsed and remebers little of the next few weeks of her life. After a 10-week stay, when the picture of her turning yellow was taken, Patricia was released. Despite her ordeal, . the first thing she did upon release was buy wine. Luckily, she was . disgusted with herself for doing it, and has been sober ever since. This picture of Patricia was taken while she was in hospital suffering from massive organ failure . 'At . the moment, doctors are happy with my progress, but my life expectancy . will be affected. My liver is so scarred, it will slowly stop . functioning,' she told Closer magazine. A scan in October will determine whether or not Patricia needs a liver transplant. Today she said:  'Life is brilliant, I am happy.

'My advice to other women in a similar situation is to go to your GP, but you have to accept your situation and you have to want to stop.'

The country remains in the grip of an obesity crisis despite the reams of faddy new diets launched every week, so maybe we need to look at the history books to find the answer to our ever increasing  waistlines? A new British company hopes to help the nation slim back to health with a simple, old-fashioned gadget used by the ancient Egyptians. So simple in fact that it looks just like a piece of string. Unlike ordinary string the Malory Band claims it won't stretch, fray, rub, rot or retain water. It can be worn 24/7 . Worn around the middle, the polyester band provides a gentle reminder of when you've had enough to eat. It provokes a state of constant awareness and motivation to eat less and more healthily. Waist measurement is seen as a reliable indicator of general health and the Malory Band is designed to be a continuous reminder of how wide our waistline is. It’s a centuries-old concept used by ancient civilisations for getting back in shape after childbirth or reducing the waistline. Ancient Egyptians, Indians and Americans were all fans. Unlike ordinary string the Malory Band claims it won’t stretch, fray, rub, rot or retain water. It can be worn 24/7 as its fabric is washable and durable - meaning it doesn't need to be removed for the shower. The band has a unique button-hole system where a round button goes through one of the button holes and the band lies at a comfortable tension around your middle, allowing it to be made smaller as you lose the inches. As your waist loses inches, the ‘tail’ becomes longer as you move the button up the button-holes to a smaller size. You can stop the inches creeping back on by continuing to wear the band after reaching your healthier target size. By wearing the band constantly, even after you've reached your goal size, you will help retain your new shape . A spokesperson said: 'The Malory Band is pretty and not something you would worry about anyone seeing under your clothing. But essentially, the band is a piece of cord - so if you’re happy with a bit of string, then go right ahead! It’s the psychology of constant awareness which string could give just as well. 'The band is not a magic potion - it simply motivates the wearer to eat more healthily, eat less, stand tall and hold their abs in and helps the wearer getting any bigger - it’s a constant gauge of size. 'Some of our case studies wear the band having lost a great deal of weight through diet and exercise and are fearful of putting it back on. 'The Malory Band puts them in control and does off with the need for calorie counting, food grouping or omission and an unhealthy relationship with a pair of bathroom scales.' New British company Malory Band looks to ancient civilisations to bring out a modern product that works . Penny Mallor is now an entrepreneur . Penny Mallor, the woman behind the band, began her career as a rally driver and over 12 years she achieved Ladies’ Rally Champion, the first woman ever to compete in a World Rally Championship car and part of Channel 4’s original crew when it first aired its coverage of the WRC. A TV presenter since 1993, Penny has been involved in many programmes, including Driven, Fifth Gear and Used Car Roadshow. Penny began speaking publicly and hosting events in 2003. Her motivational speaking uses her experience as a rally driver as an analogy for life, sport and business and her book Take Control Of Your Life reached number two in Amazon’s rankings. Penny has diversified and is now an entrepreneur in the world of health and weight loss. Her new venture - the Malory Band - is designed to motivate the wearer to lose weight and keep it off forever.","Ancient Egyptians, Indians and Americans tied a cord at the waist to slim .

A South African carpenter who lost four of his fingers in a circular saw accident has invented a prosthetic hand which is made using a 3D printer. Richard Van As, and his U.S. design partner Ivan Owen, are now making hands for people unable to afford normal prosthetic limbs. In particular, they have helped young children with a condition called amniotic band syndrome which causes them to be born with a malformed hand. Richard Van As, who lost four of his fingers in a circular saw accident in 2011, has invented a cheap prosthetic hand which is made using a 3D printer . They hope the hand will eventually be downloaded from Mr Van As’ website so people anywhere in the world can make it with the use of 3D printing. Mr Van As lost the fingers on his right hand in 2011 but was determined to continue his work as a carpenter. He said: ‘I had two problems. One, finding something that's functional for a tradesman for instance, and second, finding something that was within the reach of normal people - prosthetic limbs are ridiculously expensive.’ In trying to overcome these problems he created Robohand which can be printed, assembled and fitted anywhere in the world. It came about after Mr Van As got in contact with Mr Owen who had made a mechanical hand prop and posted footage of it in action on YouTube. They tinkered and brain-stormed and after many emails, photos, drawings, and Skype-sessions, they created their most promising prototype. Richard Van As, and his U.S. design partner Ivan Owen, are now making hands (pictured) for people unable to afford normal prosthetic limbs . They hope the hand will eventually be downloaded from Mr Van As' website so people anywhere in the world can make it with the use of 3D printing (pictured) Initially it was called Robofinger and allowed Mr Van As to use the stumps of his lost digits to operate a claw like device. During the refinement of the Robofinger, he and Mr Owen were given two 3D printers to use for prototyping and manufacturing of small parts. With these two printers in their possession their focus turned towards the creation of Robohand. The first person to benefit from a new Robohand, made mainly from plastic, was a five-year-old boy called Liam with amniotic band. Robohand, which costs about £65, can be printed, assembled and fitted anywhere in the world. Picture shows Mr Van As holding some of the 3D printed parts . Once the 3D printer has produced the parts for the hand, Mr Van As is able to assemble them (pictured) Liam, who lives in South Africa, had no useable fingers but could bend his wrist. Based on this motion, Mr Van As was able to build him a hand capable of grasping. The only thing that cannot be copied is a tendon. To solve this problem, the pair created a bungee to return the finger and then a cable to pull it. Mr Van As says he has now made well over a hundred hands for people who do not have the funds to buy a conventional prosthetic.

Liam had no useable fingers but could bend his wrist. Based on this motion, Mr Van As was able to build him a hand capable of grasping . He is currently in the process of setting up a non-profit organisation to make it easier to accept funds to build new hands. He explained there are people all over the world interested in being taught how to make and fit them. He said: ‘Hopefully the idea is you teach one, and then the next one gets taught, and further, and it will spread by itself.’ He said fitting children with Robohand was one of the most inspiring applications of this technology. Mr Van As (pictured working on the design) is currently in the process of setting up a non-profit organisation to make it easier to accept funds to build new hands . He explained that when they go to school they are the coolest kids in the school. He said: ‘Kids can be cruel, and they were teased before because they had a shortcoming in the hand, and now that they've got this Robohand thing, they're like the best thing, everybody wants to be their mate now. ‘There's a child in the U.S. with a standard myoelectric hand that cost £37,600 and the child won't wear it because there are braces and harnesses, you can't get it wet. He asked: ‘How many hands could I have done for £37,600?’ He believes the cost of making one of his Robohands is around £65 with prices dropping even further if you print and assemble Robohand yourself.","Richard Van As worked with designer Ivan Owen to create the Robohand .

The common assumption that a Christmas tipple is good for you may be wrong for most Britons . The common assumption that a couple of glasses of wine are good for you may be wrong for most Britons, new research reveals. Scientists at Australia’s Curtin University have discovered that if you are overweight, far from boosting your heart’s health, moderate alcohol consumption may actually put it at risk. Writing in this month’s issue of the Australia and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, Dr Tim Lobstein and Professor Mike Daube acknowledged that previous studies show that a little alcohol may lower your risk of heart disease, while a lot will raise the risk. However, the researchers in Perth were concerned that the data used in these studies had come from surveys undertaken more than 40 years ago when people were much slimmer than they are today. Therefore, they believed that the findings may no longer stand. Dr Lobstein, who is director of policy at the International Association for the Study of Obesity in London and who co-authored the research, said: ‘We were concerned that the findings from a previous generation may not apply to our modern, fatter population. ‘So we revisited the data in the classic Framingham Heart Study (a landmark study which identifies risk factors for heart disease), and examined the differences between slimmer and fatter men to see how the J-shaped curve held up.’ The researchers discovered that the health benefits still hold for slim men but not for those with a Body Mass Index above 27.5. Healthcare professionals recommend that a healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 25. The study comes at a time when the latest NHS figures show that 42 per cent of men and 32 per cent of women are overweight - they have a BMI of more than 25. Furthermore, 26 per cent of adults in the UK are classed as obese because their BMI is more than 30. Moderate alcohol consumption is not good for people with a BMI of more than 27.5 . Research published in The Lancet last year showed that the average BMI for adults in the UK is currently 27. Dr Lobstein said: ‘In effect, the standard advice about a small amount of alcohol being good for the heart doesn’t stack up for overweight men. ‘We will need to check other surveys and see if they show the same pattern, and we will need to check the data for women. ‘We know that apart from heart disease, other causes of disease are made worse by even small amounts of alcohol, including cancer, diabetes and stroke – the major chronic disease killers,’ he added. ‘For now, the advice has to be that there is no such thing as a beneficial level of consumption, especially if you are overweight.’ Other recent research has shown that wine could have additional health-giving properties. Studies have indicated alcohol may raise levels of good cholesterol and be beneficial to blood vessels, while antioxidants in wine are thought to protect arteries. Cardiologist Geoffrey Tofler, of the University of Sydney, has found that moderate wine drinkers have higher levels of HDL, the so-called ‘good cholesterol’. His study of 3,000 people found that the platelets of people who drank three to six standard measures a week are much less likely to clump together in a way that could cause clotting. Meanwhile, researchers at Leicester University also found that drinking a large glass of red wine each day could help prevent bowel cancer. Their research showed that resveratrol, a substance found in the skin of red grapes, has cancer-fighting properties. Just small quantities of the substance were shown to halve the growth of tumours. Similarly, researchers at the University of Missouri discovered that resveratrol can make prostate tumour cells more susceptible to radiation treatment.","Researchers have found moderate alcohol consumption may only be good for your heart if you are thin .

Surgeons yesterday announced Malala Yousufzai, 14, was in a stable condition after removing a bullet from her neck. But following Taliban threats to kill her, authorities in Pakistan decided to move her to a hospital in the army garrison town of Rawalpindi for her own safety. Scroll down for video . Outrage: Activists carry photographs of Malala Yousafzai during a protest rally against her assassination attempt in Lahore yesterday . Malala was shot, along with two other . girls, by a gunman who boarded her school bus in Swat on Tuesday. The . would-be assassin blasted her in the neck and head but she survived. One of the other victims has now recovered, while the other remains in a critical condition. Authorities today announced they have identified her attacker and offered a 10,000,000 rupee (£119,000) reward for his capture. Attacked: Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home from school . Regional governor Masood Kausar said: . 'The security agencies are closely working with each other and they have . a lot of information about the perpetrators. We hope our security . agencies will soon capture them and bring to justice.' The shooting has drawn condemnation . from world leaders and many Pakistanis. Yesterday there were protests . against the Taliban across the country in support of Malala. Her father, Ziauddin Yousufzai, who . runs a girls' school, said his daughter had defied threats for years, . believing the good work she was doing for her community was her best . protection. 'Pray for her,' her distraught uncle Faiz Mohammad said as Malala was taken from the hospital in Peshawar to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi. A husband-and-wife team of two . British doctors who were attending a seminar in Pakistan today joined . local surgeons in treating Yousufzai. And yesterday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the United States had offered any assistance necessary. 'The President found the news reprehensible and disgusting and tragic,' Carney told reporters. 'Directing violence at children is . barbaric, it's cowardly, and our hearts go out to her and the others who . were wounded as well as their families.' Yousufzai had spent the last three years campaigning for girls' education after the Taliban shut down girls' schools. She received Pakistan's highest civilian award but also a number of death threats.

United: Women hold banners demanding education rights during a protest in Islamabad . Fury over the attack has spread across . the country, with demonstrators protesting in Lahore, Peshawar, .

The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have taken responsibility for the assassination attempt and told a . Pakistani newspaper they will target her again if she survives. A man approached the school bus and . asked which one of the girls was Malala, Rasool Shah, Mingora police . chief said.

The country's top military officer, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, issued a strongly-worded statement condemning the attack. The powerful army chief rarely makes such public pronouncements, even when it comes to military matters.

She left the BBC after fearing her voice was too posh. But now radio announcer Charlotte Green is to return to the corporation – to read the football scores. In a move that could upset some of the sport’s more traditionalist fans, the 57-year-old will replace the renowned James Alexander Gordon on Radio 5 Live’s Sports Report. She will become the first woman to read the classified football results, which are broadcast  at 5pm on Saturdays, when Gordon retires after 40 years on the programme. Some listeners expressed mixed feelings when the decision was announced yesterday. Writing on Twitter one fan said ‘Charlotte Green is a funny name for a bloke’ while another asked: ‘A woman? Reading the football?’ Others were more supportive and celebrated the appointment of a woman. One posted: ‘Charlotte Green will be reading the football results on the BBC. Pack up, feminists, the war has been won.’ Miss Green, who supports Tottenham Hotspur, read the news on Radio 4 before taking voluntary redundancy in January. After she left, she revealed she felt she was too posh for the channel, saying: ‘Received pronunciation, or accent-less accent, is on the wane. The BBC’s days of employing people who sound like me are more or less over.’ The veteran broadcaster will be the first woman to read the BBC Radio 5 Live football results . The presenter, who went on to be the . voice of a Classic FM programme called Charlotte Green’s Great . Composers, described her new post – revealed by Charles Sale in . Sportsmail yesterday – as a ‘dream come true’ and ‘an honour’. She said: ‘I’m delighted to be offered this opportunity as I’ve been a football fan all my life. Passing on the torch: Miss Green will take over from James Alexander Gordon, who has read the scores out for more than 40 years . 'In fact as a six year old I used to . sit at the dining room table reading the football scores out loud from . the newspaper so this really is a dream come true. 'It is a huge honour to take over from James Alexander Gordon.’ Miss Green, who once famously had an uncontrollable giggling fit in the middle of reading a Today programme bulletin, will join the Sports Report programme in September. Announcing her appointment, Richard Burgess, Head of BBC Radio Sport, said: ‘We are delighted to welcome Charlotte to 5 Live and we are really looking forward to hearing her distinctive voice reading the classifieds, made so famous by James Alexander Gordon. 'She is a broadcaster of true calibre and I know she will bring clarity and warmth to the role.’ Her appointment comes after the BBC’s only female cricket commentator, Alison Mitchell, was denied the chance to commentate on the Ashes. She has appeared on programmes to do with the contest, but never actually  provided commentary on Test Match Special.","Presenter with cut glass accent will read out updates on BBC Radio 5 Live .

Art Donovan, who was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1968 after winning two world championships with the Baltimore Colts, died on Sunday . Legendary American Football player Art Donovan, who enjoyed a second career on the talk show circuit, died yesterday, aged 89. The Hall of Fame lineman won two world championships with the Baltimore Colts in 1958 and 1959 and also spent single seasons with the New York Yanks and Dallas Texans before retiring in 1961. Donovan died at 7.20pm at the Stella Maris Hospice in Baltimore, Kevin Byrne, senior vice president of public and community relations for the Baltimore Ravens announced. He was surrounded by more than a dozen family members. Tributes have poured in for Donovan - nicknamed Fatso - who became famous after retirement for his hilarious stories about his playing career. Ordell Braase, Donovan's teammate, told The Baltimore Sun: 'Artie made a career out of telling people everything that he'd done right - and wrong - in football. 'The diversity of his appeal was amazing. Everyone wanted to hug ""Fatso,"" from young girls to little old ladies.' Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said: 'We lost a friend, one of the finest men and one of the greatest characters we were fortunate to meet in this community and in this business. 'Baltimore is now without one of its . best and someone who was a foundation for the tremendous popularity of . football in our area. 'The world is not as bright tonight because we lost someone who could make us all smile.' Scroll down for video . Donovan enjoyed a second career as a storyteller on the talk show circuit and penned a successful autobiography . Donovan was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1968. Hall of Fame center Jim Ringo, who died in 2007, once said: 'Some of the greatest football ever played by a defensive tackle was played by Art Donovan. 'He was one of the greatest people I played against all my life.' Donovan . played in the 1958 championship game between the Colts and New York . Giants, a contest that was decided in overtime and ultimately tabbed by . some football historians as 'The Greatest Game Ever Played.' The winner's share was $4,700 and the most Donovan ever earned in one season was $22,000. Teammates said Donovan, pictured in 1962, played 'some of the greatest football' by a defensive tackle in the game's history . However, . he maintained his fame after retirement by touring the talk show . circuit and through his successful autobiography called 'Fatso'. Donovan liked to say he was a light eater, 'When it got light, I started eating.' Donovan, who was 6ft 3"" tall, weighed about 300 pounds for most of his life but his playing weight was listed at 265 pounds. 'I've . never been a gourmet eater,' he wrote. 'Kosher hot dogs, cheeseburgers, . pizza, baloney, and a couple of cases of Schlitz are all I'd need on a . desert isle.' Donovan's father was Arthur J. Donovan Sr., one of boxing's most famous referees, who marshalled 19 of Joe Louis' title fights. Donovan held the Colts to two world championships and was known in later life as a great storyteller . When the younger Donovan grew up and left the tough New York neighborhood he was brought up in, he fought in World War II and played college football at Notre Dame and Boston College. The late John Steadman, a sportswriter for The (Baltimore) Sun who covered the Colts in their glory years, once said: 'Art is a tremendous example for everyone, a wonderful Santa Claus-type individual.' Donovan broke into professional football in 1950 with the Colts, who folded after his rookie season. He played with the Yanks in 1951 and Texans in 1952 before the Dallas franchise moved to Baltimore and became the second version of the Colts.

In safe hands: Reuben Paxton, from Kelso, Roxburghshire, being held by his three-year-old sister Melissa . He had only a 50-50 chance of surviving birth but now little Reuben Paxton is being kept alive by a very special drug – Viagra. The five-month-old was born with his stomach, intestines and part of his liver inside his chest, leaving no room for his tiny lungs to develop. His heart, which has a hole in it, was also pushed to the wrong side and he has problems with the flow of blood to his lungs. Reuben underwent a life-saving seven-hour operation to correct the position of his organs when he was only four days old. He then spent three months in hospital, clinging to life. Now he is back home with his parents and is winning his battle for survival thanks to sildenafil, better known as the impotence drug Viagra. His mother, Dawn, 33, from Kelso, Roxburghshire, said: ‘Reuben has pulmonary hypertension and the drug helps to widen the [blood] vessels going into the lungs so the blood can flow better. ‘He gets it four times a day. If he didn’t take it, his lungs would  be compromised and wouldn’t function as well and he wouldn’t get enough oxygen going around his body.’ Mrs Paxton was given the devastating news that her son had  a congenital diaphragmatic hernia – a hole in the abdominal wall – when she was only 20 weeks pregnant, the same time she lost a baby only a year earlier. For the rest of her pregnancy, she and husband, Darren, 34, undertook round trips of almost 200 miles to hospital in Glasgow every four weeks to monitor their unborn child. Half of all babies with the condition die before they are born. The couple were warned that even if the child survived birth, there was a risk he might not live more than a couple of hours. Mrs Paxton said: ‘We were told that if he survived the first 24 hours, the  outcome would look better, but in particular they said the first two hours were critical.’ To add to the complications, the umbilical cord became wrapped around Reuben’s neck. Pulling together: Reuben, who was born with his stomach in his chest, with his mother Dawn, father Darren and sister Melissa . Despite this and the fact his lungs were not fully developed, the 6lb 8oz newborn was breathing well enough for doctors to let his parents see him before he was whisked away and placed on a ventilator. Mrs Paxton, who is also mother to Melissa, three, said: ‘He’s a tough little cookie. All the way through the pregnancy we were told there were no guarantees that he would survive past birth. ‘But he breathed a little bit on his own before they put him on the ventilator, so that was a bit of a relief. ‘I got to see him for a few seconds. We were still very worried at that point but I noticed he had the longest, curliest eyelashes.’ Reuben was born at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow on March 1, a week before his due date. His life-threatening condition affects only 2,500 babies. A hole in Reuben’s abdomen wall allowed his stomach, bowel and part of his liver to form inside  his chest. This pushed his heart out of position and left no room for his lungs to grow, resulting in one being only a quarter of the size it should be. The five-month-old, who spent three weeks on a ventilator, a  further five weeks on other breathing aids and battled repeated  infections, was finally allowed home after 12 weeks. It was a day his father feared he would never see. But Mrs Paxton did not have any similar doubts. She said: ‘I never for one moment thought we’d never get him home.’ Initially when he came home, Reuben was on eight different drugs. But now he only receives Viagra pills four times a day, two anti-reflux tablets and an iron supplement to help transport oxygen around his body. He is still tube fed when he sleeps at night to ensure that he continues to put on weight. And he receives regular check-ups at the hospital to monitor his progress and the hole in his heart. Mrs Paxton said: ‘It is amazing to be the four of us as a family. It was really hard being away from my daughter. ‘He’s certainly put us through it, but it’s been worth it. ‘I wouldn’t change him for the world and his big sister loves him to pieces. ‘Now it’s like he’s always been here.’","Reuben Paxton takes viagra four times a day to keep his lungs working .

The Taliban employees violent biblical methods such as stoning, cutting off hands, and gouging out eyes to those who defy their order to avoid contact with insurgent forces, who they identify as Kabul government officials and U.S. military or civilian aid, the newspaper reported. Despite the physical danger Rauf, who was unable to provide adequate medical care for his wounded daughter being a poor farmer, decided to seek American aid. Farida poses with her North Carolina host mother Asheli Thompson whose family she is now a part of after staying with them over three summers while she got corrective eye surgery . The Solace for Children charity pairs injured Afghan children with American host families for six weeks during the summer, 'to experience America [and] to experience peace on a foundation of health,' Jim Gray, a board member on the charity told WCNC. 'Some people were saying if the Taliban finds out, they'll cut off your head,' Rauf told the newspaper. 'I asked these people: Are you afraid to have your own children treated? Will you sacrifice your own flesh and blood?' 'I told them: Something good is happening here. Don't be afraid.' By taking these courageous steps Rauf has . provided opportunities for his daughter she would never have been . exposed to otherwise. After three summer getting medical treatment and living with a host family, Farida has completely adjusted to life in the U.S. seen her clutching her iPhone . Originally from a remote village in southern Afghanistan, Farida has adapted quickly to the United States since she arrived three summers ago, and now speaks fluent English complete with American slang, according to the Los Angeles Times. In North Carolina he wounds were treated so that her left eye socket has now been fitted with a conformer shell, according to the paper, a clear plastic lens which reduces the friction in her eye socket when she blinks. However, her socket closed over the plastic lens and she now needs further treatment. She was also given a pair of glasses to . correct the altered vision in her right eye and a sparkly purple eye . patch to cover her left. Wearing a Solace for Children shirt Farida gives a smile for the camera standing next to her host father Eric Thompson . She has also been given a second family here in the United States. Her host parents Asheli and Eric Thompson view Farida as their own daughter and in turn she calls them 'Mommy' and 'Daddy,' the article states. The Thompson's, who have two young daughters of their own, gave Frida the full American experience while she stayed with them, taking her on a trip of Disney World, the ocean, and of course, sampling the local cuisine at McDonald's. Farida is the second injured girl the Thompson's took into their home, both of whom they view as their own. Three . years ago the family hosted a 7-year-old girl who was also injured in a . Taliban attack, losing an eye and having part of her fact destroyed by . acid. After the explosion Farida had a conformer shell fitted to her eye and now wears a purple patch and corrective lenses . 'It’s humbling, yet just a great feeling to know you've had a positive impact on somebody's life that's been through such trauma,' Eric Thompson told WCNC. Now back at home Farida's progressive father is making sure the opportunities she was exposed to abroad don't go wasted. Rauf has enrolled his daughter in school run by the charity in Kabul and does not intend to marry her off at a young age, but rather let her pursue an education, the paper reports. 'Everything is different now for her. She will go to school. She'll be an educated woman,' he told the Los Angeles Times. 'I believe in my heart it's things like this that will bring peace to our country.' In 2012 Malala Yousafzai was also attacked by the Taliban in Pakistan after she published a blog post advocating for women's education . Since her near fatal attack Yousafzai has become a leading advocate for women's education in countries where it is prohibited . Farida's story follows a few years after the story of another young girl who was injured by the Taliban. In 2012 Malala Yousafzai was attacked by Taliban forces after publishing an outspoken blog post advocating for women's education under the oppressive Taliban rule in Pakistan. She was shot in the head and neck as she was being driven home from . school in the Swat Valley in north-west Pakistan. Malala was rushed to Britain where she received reconstructive surgery and eventually regained her eyesight. Since the shooting Malala has become an outspoken human activist for women's rights in countries with oppressive regimes.","Farida, 11, lost her eye in Afghanistan to a Taliban-planted bomb .

But, as this training video from 1993 shows, a young David Beckham needed coaching off the field to get used to talking to the media. A 17-year-old Beckham is seen during a role-play interview as part of the rigorous preparation for life as a professional footballer. And in a frank written assessment of his own performance, the future star wrote: 'I played crap... the officials were crap as well.' Scroll down to watch the video... A 17-year-old David Beckham is seen practising talking to the media in a video set to sell for £3,000 at auction . In the footage, Beckham is seen answering questions about his performance as part of his youth team training at Manchester United . The future England captain was part of the famous Manchester United youth team that won the 1992 FA Youth Cup. His team-mates Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville are also seen practising their post-match interviews in the video, which is expected to fetch £3,000 at auction next week. Beckham, from Leystonstone, east London, appears to be slightly awkward in front of the camera as he answers questions about his performance during the mock interview. He squirms and looks embarrassed but gives a shy smile when the interviewer asks him to talk through his goal-scoring moment, with Beckham answering: 'Soon as I hit the ball I knew it was going in the top corner.' Later, when asked to imagine that the team had lost the Youth Cup final, Beckham puts on a suitably sad face as he talks about the effect defeat would have on 'the lads'. He says: ''I didn’t do too well, really. Just nothin' was going right, really. Nothin' went our way really. We didn’t have no luck.' At another point, he tells interviewer Andy Buckley how . he hoped to play for United's first team in the next couple of years and . go on to emulate his hero Bryan Robson. Dressed casually in a blue polo shirt, the only hint of Beckham's future as a fashion icon is his slicked-back hair, which would later earn him a contract with Brylcreem. The young players also had to analyse their performances on paper, with Beckham criticising himself for playing 'really crap' The video also shows that Beckham, now a . polished and media-savvy performer, has lost some of his . east London accent over the years, with the auctioneer selling the video . speculating that he may have had elocution lessons to help his public . speaking. As well as the practice TV interviews, Sir Alex Ferguson's young players also had to analyse their best and worst performances on handwritten forms. Beckham wrote: 'My . best game was the youth cup final in 1991 against Crystal Palace 1st leg . when we won 3-1 and everythink (sic) went right and I scored a good . goal + set up 1 and the crowd was really good and load (sic).' For his worst game, he wrote: 'Youth cup final 2nd leg good atmosphere but I played really crap, nothink (sic) went right for me or the team, and the officials were crap as well.' The March 1993 media training course was also taken by Giggs, Neville and Scholes, with Ferguson wanting them well-prepared for dealing with fame and attention from an early age. Beckham, seen buying health shakes in West Hollywood, has come a long way since his youth team days . Ryan Giggs gave short, to-the-point answers before walking away from the camera quickly once his interview was over . Giggs showed that he was highly self-critical by being unable to name a game where he'd played well . All four footballers seem to find it difficult to relax with the camera on them and regularly looked at the floor instead of their interviewer. Giggs, wearing a backwards baseball cap, speaks softly, gives short answers and walks off quickly afterwards to get out of the spotlight despite being told 'very good'. In his notes, Giggs couldn't think of a . match he'd played well in and left a blank space. He did, however, say that his performance against Oldham wasn't . good enough, writing: 'I got marked out of the game and I must of . kicked the ball about twice.' Neville, now a Mail on Sunday sports columnist and Sky Sports pundit, analysed the 1993 Youth Cup Final second leg against Leeds in his typically blunt fashion. Gary Neville, another member of the youth team who stayed with the club for years, also took part in the session . Gary Neville's notes celebrated the team victory at Crystal Palace but bemoaned that he 'didn't feel in the game' against Leeds . 'A******* dropped out. Didn't feel in the game.' Scholes wrote: 'I thought I played well in . the FA Cup semi-final second leg against Millwall in which we needed to . win 2-0 to progress to the final.' He . added: 'The worst game I played in was the second leg of the final . against Leeds Utd where we were beaten 2-1 and lost the cup.' The 38 minute-long film and the notes each player made were kept by the man who staged the media training and will go under the hammer on August 10. Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, said: 'It is a fascinating video because it shows it wasn’t just football these young men were training in. Paul Scholes, who has only just retired from playing for United, also practised his public speaking in the March 1993 video . Scholes's analysis said he'd played well when the team won and played badly when the team lost . The players, who went on to achieve worldwide fame with United, were part of the club's dominating youth team in the early Nineties. From left, coach Eric Harrison, Giggs, Nicky Butt, Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Scholes and Terry Cooke . 'The club clearly felt that this crop of players were destined for the big time and felt that they had a responsibility to get them used to the cameras and speaking in public. 'The David Beckham footage is interesting. He spoke very commonly and had a lack of pronunciation to say the least, often using words like ‘I fink’ and ‘nuffink’. 'He must have given thousands of interviews since then and probably undergone some elocution lessons along the way to make him into the polished performer he is with the media today.'","March 1993 footage was part of Beckham's training with Manchester United .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:14 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:41 EST, 5 August 2013 . Therapists say admitting one has a problem is the first step toward recovery. For San Diego Mayor Bob Filner that could be tricky. The first-term mayor and former congressman starts two weeks of intensive therapy Monday while facing a sexual harassment lawsuit and calls for his resignation amid a flurry of allegations that he groped women for years. Even as he undergoes treatment, Filner is set to be grilled by lawyers under oath this week in a lawsuit brought by his former communications director that claims he asked her to work without panties, told her he wanted to see her naked and dragged her around in a headlock while whispering in her ear. Seeking help: Mayor Bob Filner of San Diego speaks at a press conference announcing his intention to seek professional help for sexual harassent issues July 26 . Neither Filner nor his office has released details about his therapy or its location. Filner is picking up the tab for the treatment. Filner's accusers, his one-time supporters and voters have expressed skepticism that any two-week program is an appropriate remedy for what Filner himself has described as years of inappropriate behavior toward women. Longtime therapists also questioned how much progress could be made. ""It is pie-in-the-sky to think that in two weeks anyone could be a new man,"" said Helen Friedman, a St. Louis psychologist who has treated compulsive sexual behavior for 30 years, though she said it was a good start. Success will depend on how far the 70-year-old Filner goes in acknowledging his problems, experts said. Before he was mayor: Then-mayoral candidate Bob Filner speaks during a campaign stop in October, 2012 . ""Typically in the first few sessions you have to find someone you really trust,"" said Lilli Friedland, a Beverly Hills psychologist who advises business executives on sexual harassment. ""`Can I open up with all my dirty laundry, and is this person expert enough?' It takes a number of sessions and visits to establish that trust."" Some voters wondered whether the therapy stint was simply an effort to buy time amid extraordinary pressure to resign. ""He needs to save face,"" said Christina Imhoof, 72, who voted for Filner in November but then quit the Democratic Party over the allegations. She said she suspects Filner will return after the time-out and say his therapist has encouraged him to resign for medical reasons. Filner announced his plans on July 26 to enter a behavioral counseling clinic to ""begin the process of addressing my behavior."" He called it the first step in a continuing program that would involve ongoing counseling. ""I must become a better person ... I must demonstrate that my behavior has changed,"" Filner said then, while offering apologies and an acknowledgement that his ""failure to respect women, and the intimidating contact, is inexcusable."" The mayor's office did not respond to interview requests. Ten women, including a university dean and a retired Navy rear admiral, have gone public in the past month with accusations that Filner made unwanted passes. Some contend that he cornered them and made sexual advances that included groping and slobbering kisses. Not leaving: Filner has refused demands he step down, saying he will instead seek help . At least five renewed their calls for Filner to resign after he pledged to begin therapy. ""It is highly doubtful that two weeks of therapy will correct for decades of reprehensible behavior,"" said Laura Fink, who alleges that Filner patted her buttocks at a 2005 fundraiser when she was deputy campaign manager to the then-congressman. One accuser, former Filner communications director Irene McCormack Jackson, has filed a harassment lawsuit against him. Her lawyer, Filner's attorney and city lawyers will depose him Friday. Filner, the city's first Democratic leader in 20 years, will keep full powers while in therapy and said he would be briefed twice-daily on city business. Filner also has delegated significant authority, including the ability to sign contracts, to an interim chief operating officer, Walt Ekard, a former county administrator. The mayor's absence comes during a summer lull, with the City Council on August recess. Nevertheless Filner's Republican predecessor, Jerry Sanders, said his absence occurs when the mayor's office normally ""would get caught up, do a lot of policy work and make sure things got in order."" Sanders, who now leads the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, believes the scandal is affecting day-to-day business. He said department directors are hesitant to make decisions, that money has not been released for the city's tourism marketing district, and investors are reluctant to start projects. Legal troubles: The city of San Diego sued its embattled mayor Bob Filner on Tuesday, seeking to recover from him any damages it might face in a lawsuit filed by his former press secretary . ""We are hearing companies saying: `Why would we move to San Diego? With this going on the city is the absolute object of ridicule around the country,'"" Sanders said. Experts who spoke generally about treatment approaches and not specifically about Filner said patients being treated for addictive or compulsive sexual behavior typically get a medical examination to rule out chemical imbalances or other physical ailments. Therapists would try to build trust so the patient is comfortable sharing personal information and try to determine if the person is in denial. Once a problem is acknowledged, doctors try to identify what triggers the behavior so patients can develop a coping mechanism, build a support network and find other ways to control it. Long-term treatment may involve weekly group or individual therapy. Friedman said any such recovery requires hard work over a lifetime. ""People feel after an inpatient stay that they have things under control,"" she said. ""However, when they are back in their usual environment, they're confronted with the same triggers that got them into treatment.""","One of the harassed women accused him of saying he wanted to see naked while dragging her around in a headlock whispering in her ear .

Sentenced: Ayuub Mohammed was sentenced to five years in a young offender's institute for holding up two London hotels . A 15-year-old boy who held staff at two separate London hotels at gunpoint and demanded cash in two armed robberies has been sentenced to five years in a young offender's institute. Ayuub Mohammed threatened receptionists with a handgun at the Arriva Hotel in Bloomsbury and the Howard Winchester Hotel in Argyle Street within the space of just four hours in February. Blackfriars Crown Court heard that Mohammed arrived at the Arriva Hotel on Swinton Street at around 11pm on February 27, pulled a gun from his pocket and demanded cash from the hotel receptionist. He hit a hotel worker with the gun and ordered him to open the hotel safe. The receptionist gave Mohammed a small amount of cash before forcing a hotel guest to hand over £180 in cash and a mobile phone. The court heard that at 3am on February 28th, Mohammed entered the second hotel, the Howard Winchester, and asked a receptionist to search for room availability. He then pulled out the gun and threatened staff, again asking for cash. But he left the hotel empty handed when the receptionist attempted to grab the gun. Following a police investigation, Mohammed was eventually arrested and charged in June. He pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery, one count of attempted robbery and two counts of possession of an imitation firearm, and was sentenced to a total of five years. Detectives believe that he was not working alone and appealed for anyone with information to get in touch. Investigating officer, Det Con Dawn Bolitho, said: 'Despite his young age, Mohammed was willing to target these two hotels and commit serious offences for his own personal gain. 'What this sentence shows is that the law will fall heavy on anyone using guns to commit crime and intimidate people.'

The country's longest-serving policeman who is retiring after almost 50 years has spoken about how the job has changed since he first started as a bobby on the beat. PC Mick Mountain, 66, described how modern officers have to do twice the amount of work because of paperwork and crime is only down because people have problems reporting it. Although he has had 'the most fantastic career', PC Mountain expressed frustration at how advances in technology have led to officers having to spend more time ensuring information is electronically filed. Scroll down for video . PC Mick Mountain at Horse Guards Parade in London during Trooping the Colour in 1972 (left) and (right) at Horse Guards Parade this week . When asked if he thought more time was being spent on admin than on fighting crime, PC Mountain said: 'Well I'm finding it is. I don't actually work in a police station obviously any longer. 'I work at the Palace of Westminster on security, so I don't get as much work as they do. 'From what I gather, yes it is the case, because I've tried to report crimes myself like any other citizen and it's a little more difficult than it used to be. ""Oh yes, could you call in? Or could you send us an email?"". 'I'm a policeman, I want to report it to a police officer, basically. And I think that is one of the reasons recently crime has gone down. People won't report it. Too many problems. But that's another issue.' PC Mountain, from Morden, South London, joined the police in 1966 after his father persuaded him to apply. He added that in the past officers would write and submit a report and do additional paperwork if needed, whereas now more time is taken up with ensuring all admin is completed electronically. He said: 'It's changed so much. It's changed our whole job.' The country's longest-serving police officer said officers today have to do 'more or less twice the work' due to increased admin . He added: 'But we have to do more or less twice the work, because you do your paperwork, and then you've got to scan it in to the electronic side, because everything's now saved and dealt with electronically.' When asked if he felt any sympathy for young people coming into the job now, PC Mountain said: 'Yeah I will because it's a totally different job to when I joined in regarding the circumstances of the regulations and such.' PC Mountain said technology has changed the job of policing . He added: 'For the young kids it's quite difficult.' PC Mountain also said that while people are still as violent as they were in the past, the public expects police officers to 'behave in a different manner' now. When asked if police officers today have to be more careful and cautious when on the job, he said: . 'Well most certainly, they have to, yeah. That's just the way the public expects us to behave in a different manner. 'I mean the people haven't changed. They're still as violent in some cases as they were then, but we have to approach it in a different manner, and of course we do, and our training is based towards that.' PC Mountain looks back on his earlier years playing sport with fondness and counts it as one of the highlights of his career. He said: 'We were always allowed to do sports. No longer the case, we don't have enough personnel to do it so we don't do it any longer. 'But I was playing football and I boxed for the police, and I played football and did cross-country running, all in the job time, because we were the Metropolitan Police force. 'We're now the service, and as soon as we became the service it did change. We don't really run football teams at police stations any longer, because they're required on the streets because their numbers came down and our requirement was further on.' Despite the changes he has witnessed throughout his career, PC Mountain, who has arrested thousands of criminals, said: 'I've had a great time.' He recalled one arrest which left him fearing for his life which involved a man with a hand grenade who threatened to pull the pin. The officer ripped the grenade from the man before throwing it into open space. Although he feared for his life, he said it is not until after that sort of scenario is over that you realise the danger you were in, and 'that's what police do', he said. 'You don't think it at the time. At the time you just deal with it. We get ourselves into trouble. 'Health and safety probably dislike us intently. You just react to a situation and do what you think is needed,' he said. Reflecting on what he will miss most about his career, he said: 'People - the amount of people I speak to on a daily basis, the amount of comrades I've got at work.' PC Mountain, who is married with two children, is looking forward to enjoying more travel in his retirement.","PC Mick Mountain, 66, is retiring from the Metropolitan Police Service .

Drink-drivers who blow only marginally positive in a breath-test are to be stripped of their statutory right to a second-chance blood or urine test under a  new Government legal crackdown. The controversial measure aims to  counter 'delaying tactics' by drunk motorists who play for time and exploit legal loopholes to escape conviction. A new Bill put before Parliament today removes motorists' statutory right to a second-opinion blood or urine test where a breath test reading is just above, but close to, the legal limit. The Bill will close the loophole allowing those testing marginally positive in breath-tests to play for time to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken - thus escaping prosecution . This will close the loophole allowing . those testing marginally  positive in breath-tests to play for time to . sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken – thus . escaping prosecution. It is part of a package of measures to crack down on drink and drug drivers unveiled as part of the new Cabinet Office Deregulation Bill. Road safety minister Stephen Hammond said the new Bill will 'streamline enforcement against drink-driving.' He said a quarter (25 per cent) of drink-drive suspects who opted for a blood test at police station  where there is no on-hand doctor managed to get off. Overall some 1 in 12 (8 per cent) of those arrested for drink-driving currently opt for a second chance blood test. A Whitehall spokesman said: 'This will close a loophole which allows those testing positive in breath tests to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken. Currently, drivers who record less than 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath have the right to demand a blood or urine test - despite being over the legal limit of 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres . 'To speed up enforcement process, the government will also legislate to allow police the option not to perform a preliminary breath test where roadside 'evidential' breath tests are carried out. Currently, drivers who record less than 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath have the right to demand a blood or urine test - despite being over the legal limit of 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres. This is known as the 'statutory option' and dates back to the original introduction of breathalyser technology when there were concerns over reliability. A Whitehall spokesman said: 'In his review of drink and drug driving, Sir Peter North recommended the removal of the right to demand a blood or urine test as evidence showed people were using it as a delaying tactic. The Government also believes that improvements in the accuracy of breathalyser technology means that this option is no longer necessary. ' The new Bill also removes the requirement for a preliminary breath test where roadside 'evidential' breath testing is used. Currently, when a suspected drink-driver is pulled over by police, they undergo a preliminary breath test at the roadside and are then taken to a police station for a further 'evidential' test whose results can be used in court. This will be  dependent on the imminent introduction of new advanced and more sophisticated mobile roadside 'evidential' breath test devices which police can use on the spot. These evidential roadside breathalysers are not currently in use but are expected soon to receive approval by the Home Office ahead of their widespread 'roll-out', say ministers. The Whitehall spokesman added: 'At the moment results from the evidential test taken at police stations are the only ones able to be used as evidence. 'Under the new Bill, once mobile evidential testing devices are deployed, the police could perform the evidential test at the roadside so the preliminary test would not be required.' Similar roadside test devices  for drug-drivers are also in the pipeline awaiting approval. More than 1,500 people a year are killed or seriously injured in drink drive incidents and 50,000 drink drivers are convicted each year. Some 280 people were killed outright in 2011 – a 12 per cent rise. Road safety minister Stephen Hammond said: 'We have made great progress in tackling drink driving but last year 280 people died in accidents where the driver was over the limit and we are determined to tackle this irresponsible minority.' Mr Hammond added the measures would make enforcement 'easier and less bureaucratic' adding: 'These common sense measures reflect advances in equipment used by the police and will make our roads safer by ensuring drink drivers are taken off the road.' Breathalyser devices have been used by police for drink-drive screening since 1967 and as evidence for about 30 years since 1983. The new Government Bill also paves the way for a wider range of registered healthcare professionals given the power to take evidential blood samples in hospitals and to assess whether a driver may have a condition due to a drug. The aim is to reduce pressure on hard-pressed doctors.","Controversial measure aims to  counter 'delaying tactics' by drunk motorists who play for time and exploit legal loopholes .

Sheriff Bova said NO'. According to Taylor, Sheriff Bova told him, 'I won't allow it,' and that 'an Ariel Castro interview from jail isn’t going to happen in Cleveland.' A spokesperson for Sheriff Bova said that the reason Lauer was denied the interview was because Castro was being moved yesterday to Lorain Correctional Institution in Grafton, Ohio. 'Matt Lauer arrived at the jail on Friday . morning and his interview request was denied. Castro is leaving the . building today and the interview was declined for security purposes,' she said. Monster: Many Twitter users expressed relief that Lauer didn't get an interview with Castro, saying the kidnapper doesn't deserve any more airtime . 'I won't allow it': Frank Bova, Cuyahoga County Sheriff, denied Matt Lauer access to Ariel Castro . A spokesperson for Ohio's prisons department says Castro will be isolated from the greater prison population for his own safety at the beginning of his sentence due to the high profile nature of his case. Castro's lawyers struck a deal with prosecutors that spared him the death sentence but also spared his victims having to testify in court, pleading guilty to aggravated murder, kidnapping and rape on Thursday. NBC's Today show has declined to comment on the incident, but Twitter users are speculating about Lauer's interview techniques. @LovinTheTribe wrote, 'Did Castro agree to interview first? Was wondering why Lauer just showed up?' According to Taylor, the Today show had already secured the interview. 'MY SOURCE: @MLauer & @todayshow had green light for interview with #ArielCastro today but County Sheriff Frank Bova pulled the plug,' he wrote.","Matt Lauer was seen being turned away from the Ohio prison where Ariel Castro is being held .

Andrew Silverman, the real estate mogul whose socialite wife Lauren is pregnant with Simon Cowell's baby, co-owns a hotel in Panama that is known for prostitution, it emerged today. Silverman's company took over the Veneto hotel - which one travel website claims has been a 'Panama sex destination for decades' - in 2007 for $90 million. The revelations come as sources close to Silverman's estranged wife told MailOnline that he is 'no angel' - even though friends have tried to paint him as an injured, innocent party. Split: Andrew Silverman, pictured left at his house in Bridgehampton, New York on Friday, owns a hotel known for prostitution, it has emerged. His estranged wife, right, is pregnant with Simon Cowell's child . A website named the Panama Sex Guide Web says: 'If you're a rookie, the Veneto is the place to start your journey in to Panama City's night scene.' It explains that as many as 30 girls will be working the casino on any given evening and will take up to $350 for a night 'depending on the talent level you desire'. 'If you find what you are looking for, you can take them up to your room with no questions asked and no need to leave the hotel,' it adds. Travel site The Panama Report added that the Veneto's 'resident hookers are fun to an extent: They're like a wild zebra which the safari-going vacationers find exotic and untamed,' the New York Post reported. Scene: A company part run by Silverman bought the resort in 2007 for $90 million . Lavish: The hotel, in Panama City, has 327 bedrooms, four restaurants and two bars . 'On the prowl': Some online reviewers said scores of prostitutes looked for business in the casino of the hotel . And a recent recent review on TripAdvisor warned that the hotel, which has 327 rooms, four restaurants and two bars, is 'not great for family visits' due to the prostitutes. Another reviewer last month said that the casino is full of as many as 100 prostitutes a night. 'Very easy to identify these women who are mostly well dressed with straight hair and with breast and buttock implants,' the reviewer wrote. The hotel manager responded to the review: 'I want to... let you know that we do not encourage prostitution, however it is legal in Panama.' A hotel source added that all profits from the hotel go to building schools throughout the country. And today a family source hit back at the accusations over the casino, telling MailOnline: 'The casino is highly regulated like all others in Panama and is open to the public, just like all the major properties in Las Vegas. 'This is a desperate attempt to try and change the subject from Lauren's infidelity and to smear her husband, who has refrained from attacking her because he places a greater priority on protecting his son than further embarrassing the son's mother.' Above board: Hotel staff noted that prostitution is not illegal in Panama but that they did not encourage it . Interior: Other websites said that customers could take prostitutes to their rooms with no questions asked . The revelations come after friends . have tried to claim the moral high ground on Andrew's behalf, painting . him as the innocent party while his wife struck up a relationship with . his friend Simon Cowell. But sources close to his estranged wife Lauren have said he is 'no angel'. One family source in Florida told MailOnline: 'People will think that Andrew is the totally innocent party in all this. 'But . if this divorce gets ugly, then it won't be one-sided, Lauren knows . everything about Andrew - and believe me, he's no angel.' Another source added: 'He has been known to say to friends, ""Let's go away and get some girls,"" presumably to his place in Panama,' the Post reported. Stepping out: Lauren Silverman is seen by her Bridgehampton, New York home on Monday morning as she takes her son to the school bus . Parents to be: Lauren Silverman is believed to be around 10 weeks pregnant with Cowell's child . He also asked the husbands of Lauren's friends to party with him in Las Vegas, a source said. But another friend of the couple added: 'A bunch of guys going away for the weekend is pretty normal behavior... It’s sad to see someone desperately trying to smear Andrew.' The couple, who have been married for ten years, are now going through a divorce and have said that their seven-year-old son is the priority. Andrew is said to be looking for sole custody of the boy.","Friend claims Andrew Silverman is 'no angel'

In her excitement, the 25-year-old managed to spend £3,000 on clothes, toys and nursery furniture, all in the most girlish shade of pink. Trouble was, when the big day finally came, the 'little princess' they were expecting turned out to be a little boy. Pretty in pink: Sarah Sharples and her husband Lee were told by doctors they were expecting a baby girl so spent £3,000 on pretty baby essentials... but then she gave birth to a little boy and is now stuck with a wardrobe full of pink clothes . Is that you, Lily-Mae: When baby Joseph was born he was quite a surprise, not only because he was a little bit early, but also because he was a boy... and his parents thought he was going to be a girl . So now Sarah, who lives in Blyth, . Northumberland, with husband Lee, 37, who had already eagerly decorated the pink nursery with stencils of their supposed daughter's chosen name, Lily-Mae - are adapting all their preparations to make them more suitable for their new son, Joseph. Sarah said: 'I couldn't understand it when the midwife said it was a boy. All our scans had confirmed it was a girl and I had everything prepared in pink. 'We had picked her name, Lily-Mae, and had the room decorated with her name stencilled across the pink feature wall. We even had personalised blankets as gifts from family and friends.' When Sarah found out she was pregnant, she and Lee decided they wished to know the baby's sex so they could be fully prepared for everything to come. Discovering it was a girl meant the forward-thinking couple could purchase all they needed for their 'little princess'. A room fit for a little princess: The nursery was designed for Lily-Mae, and even had her name stencilled on the walls, but it has now been decorated with Monsters Inc to make it more suitable for Joseph . Every girl's dream wardrobe: Little Lily-Mae already had a closet full of pretty dresses and fluffy booties before she was born... but then little Joseph came along instead . Mother-to-be: The eager couple spent £3.000 on their unborn daughter, and were even give a personalised blanket embroidered with her name, Lily-Mae . Friends and family bought lots of pink clothes and accessories as gifts, and their own spending began to mount up too. But Sarah always knew having a baby wasn't going to be cheap, so the couple were happy to spend the money. She said: 'It was my first baby and so we had to buy all the essentials. 'I wanted everything to be perfect for her so that she would want for nothing. Being prepared was my main concern, and seeing as I knew I was having a girl I didn't see the harm in buying everything in pink.' Little princess? Luckily the couple bought most of the clothes in Asda, who let them take them back and exchange little dresses for dungarees and blue T-shirts for baby Joseph . Sarah said: 'The midwife said to Lee that there was something we needed to see. I instantly started panicking thinking what could possibly be wrong. She then said she wanted to congratulate us on the birth of our son' Joseph's new room: The couple's baby now has a Monsters Inc.-themed room . And when Sarah went into labour four weeks early, she knew everything was ready for their new arrival. But when the midwife went to hand the newborn to her she couldn’t believe what she was hearing. Sarah said: 'The midwife said to Lee that there was something we needed to see. 'I instantly started panicking thinking what could possibly be wrong. She then said she wanted to congratulate us on the birth of our son. 'We looked at each other and couldn't believe that Lily-Mae was actually a boy. 'We decided to name him Joseph as we didn't think he would appreciate the name Lily-Mae.' Sarah and Lee then had to start the mammoth task of trying to get back the staggering £3,000 they had spent so that they could get Joseph everything he would need. So prepared: The couple were very pleased with themselves for preparing so well for the birth of their daughter . Do you know who I am: Doctors told Sarah that she was definitely expecting a girl when they gave her her 20-week scan . Lee said: 'There was so much to change and friends and family have been so helpful. 'We had bought most of the clothes from ASDA and they were fantastic and let us exchange everything. 'But we still have a lot of pink things that we can't return and so we’re just keeping them and hoping, at some stage, we have a girl. 'The nursery is now redecorated with a Monsters Inc. theme, so we think Joseph will prefer that to a pink room.' I'm SURE it's a girl: Doctors were wrong about the sex of the couple's baby... as he turned out to be a boy .

She's at the centre of one of the most talked-about celebrity scandals of the century. But Lauren Silverman did her utmost to take her mind off her situation over the weekend, as she headed out for a spot of retail therapy. The 36-year-old socialite, who is expecting a baby with music mogul Simon Cowell, wore a fitted yellow minidress as she was joined by her sister and son Adam as the group browsed the local shops in Bridgehampton, New York. Lauren's outing came as Cowell headed to St Tropez, where he is expected to spend the next month alongside ex-girlfriends including Sinitta, Terri Seymour and Jackie St Clair, as well as former fiancée Mezhgan Hussainy. Keeping a low profile: Lauren displayed the tiniest hint of a bump in the tight dress . Putting the drama behind him: Cowell was pictured at a One Direction concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night . The X Factor supremo, 53, will . tour Europe and take time to evaluate how exactly to proceed after it . was revealed last week that New York socialite Lauren - married to his . friend Andrew - is expecting his baby. Ironically, . it was on board the $458,000-a-week Slipstream that Cowell was pictured . sharing a tender embrace with Lauren last August, in images that came . to light over the weekend. Despite the St Tropez trip, Cowell is also expected to fly to . Britain within the next few days to meet up with his 87-year-old mother Julie and brother . Nick to discuss the pregnancy and his plans for the future. A friend of Cowell’s said: ‘They are both worried about the situation and want to see him face to face.'

Prior to heading to St Tropez, Cowell . was seen taking his mind off the drama in his personal life by . attending a One Direction concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night. Laying low: Simon Cowell leaves his Los Angeles home on Friday night for a month-long trip to Europe . Getting away from it all: Cowell had to deflect questions about the baby at the X Factor TCA press tour last week . The 53-year-old was spotted mingling . with fans, standing alongside a male friend, as he stood in the audience . and watched his X Factor stars perform in the city. But as Cowell spent his weekend in . Vegas before jetting off to France, his lover Lauren was seen in the . Hamptons, where she is believed to have been attempting to come to an 'amicable resolution' with her estranged husband Andrew over their divorce,  according to one source. The couple want to make their seven-year-old son Adam their main priority, the source said. Furore: The X Factor star is having a baby with Lauren Silverman, a married New York socialite . 'Andrew stayed at the house to create some normalcy for their son,' a source told The New York Post. 'There was no talk about the divorce . settlement. That is being handled by the lawyers. There was minimal . conversation between them. It was done purely for their child.' However, the divorce is said to . have taken a nasty turn because Andrew is 'p*****' by rumours that he . knew about Cowell's relationship with his wife all along.

The statement was in response to an earlier TMZ report that said Andrew knew about the affair all along. Thrashing it out: Lauren is said to be trying to reach an amicable agreement with estranged husband Andrew over their divorce . They said Lauren was 'outraged' that when he feigned shock at pictures of the Hamptons socialite kissing Simon on a yacht last year. The website reported that Lauren has alleged to close friends that Andrew 'knew what was going on the whole time and he was doing the same thing.' While Lauren's pregnancy is still in early days, Cowell is said to be concerned about the strain the situation and publicity could put on the socialite.

It remains to be seen just how the . news that he is to be a father will go down with Cowell, who has never . made a secret of the fact that he doesn't believe he is the right . material to become a parent. In an interview in 2009, Cowell said: 'God, no. I couldn't have children. If I had them here drawing on the walls I'd go nuts. 'With . kids, you've got a routine you can't escape from. You've got to be up . at a certain time. Got to listen. When all you want to do is sit in a . corner thinking.'

Teacher Erin Gaskell faces 10 years in jail for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old pupil she taught . A female Spanish teacher has been warned she faces up to ten years in prison after sexually assaulting a 15-year-old male pupil. Erin Haskell, 32, pleased guilty to second-degree sexual assault on one of her students while she worked at Toms River Intermediate South in Beachwood, New Jersey. Haskell taught Spanish to fifth to eighth-grade students at the school and also served as faculty advisor to the drama club. Her victim was a 15-year-old male who was subjected to sexual abuse between June 2012 and September 2012, taking place in Beachwood and Barnegat, the town where Haskell lived. Haskell was told she faces up to ten years in state prison after pleading guilty to second-degree sexual assault at the Superior Court yesterday. The case was passed on to the county Prosecutor’s Office by the state Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit of the Department of Children and Families, authorities said. A date for her sentencing has not been set yet. Before Haskell is sentenced she must undergo a psychological evaluation to determine whether she is likely to commit any further sexual offences. A report on her mental health from the Avenel Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center in Woodbridge is expected to be presented to the court in about four months and will be a factor in her sentencing, Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office said. Haskell also will be subject to Megan’s Law registration, parole supervision for life and barred from ever having contact with the victim. In exchange for her guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to drop the more serious charge of aggravated sexual assault and other offences related to the crime. Erin Haskell sexually assaulted the boy at Toms River Intermediate South in New Jersey (pictured), where she taught Spanish and served as an advisor to the drama club . Judge Francis R. Hodgson accepted the plea during an afternoon hearing. Haskell has been released on bail, which is set at $300,000, since her arrest in November. Ben Giovine, president of the Toms River Regional Board of Education, said Haskell was suspended without pay following her arrest in November and resigned on January 11. He said the board will try and ensure a similar situation doesn't happen again by being more vigilant. 'We hold our teachers up to the highest standard of conduct,' Mr Giovine told Asbury Park Press. 'We all have to continue to be vigilant to ensure that a situation like this doesn’t happen again.' Mr Giovine, 30, added that in the 1990s, when he was growing up, teachers did not act this way. 'It seems more commonplace,' he said. He also highlighted a recent case where another female teacher, this time at Wall Township High School, was arrested last week on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old male student. Kalee Warnick, 22, was arrested last week on charges of third-degree aggravated criminal sexual contact and second-degree having a sexual relationship with a minor she had care over, according to the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office.","Erin Haskell, 32, admitted sexually assaulting a 15-year-old pupil .

The Chicago Blackhawks player is selling his framed 12 stitches accompanied by his autograph plus a few other items to raise money for cancer. Shaw needed his upper cheek to be stitched together after a hefty whack in the face by the puck, during the first period of Game Six on June 24. Charitable: Andrew Shaw, Number 65 of the Chicago Blackhawks, was hit in the face with a puck during the Stanley Cup Final. He is auctioning off the stitches he received for charity . The framed stitches, together with Mr Shaw's autograph and a few other items, will be sold on eBay - 100 per cent of the final bid price will benefit the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research . The player fell to the ice and lay motionless for a few seconds before he was helped off to the changing rooms for treatment. The injured forward later returned to the Cup Final to help the Hawks win their second cup in four seasons, according to ESPN.com. The news service quotes Joel Alpert, the AM sports marketing group owner, as saying: 'Immediately after the finals, I suggested to Andrew that he keeps his stitches as we could use them to raise money for a good cause.' He continued: 'Andrew said he wanted to support breast cancer research, and from there we came up with the auction concept.' The final amount raised will be donated to the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research - a charity founded by the late ESPN commentator and former basketball star and coach, Jim Valveno (1946-1993). Winner: Shaw pictured celebrating with the Stanley Cup after the victory over the Boston Bruins on June 24 .

This 1940s photo shows Henrietta Lacks, whose cells have been used for cancer research for decades . Information about the most famous and valuable human cells in the history of science is about to become a little harder for researchers to get. The National Institutes of Health announced on Wednesday that it had reached an agreement with the family of the late Henrietta Lacks, the African-American woman whose cancer cells scientists took without her permission 62 years ago and used to create an endlessly replicating cell line now used in countless labs worldwide. Under the unprecedented pact, a grandson and a great-granddaughter of Lacks, whose story was told in the 2010 best-selling book 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,' will help decide which biomedical researchers will have access to the complete genome data in cells derived from her cervical tumor, called HeLa cells. That data - which can be used to infer medical and other information about Lacks' family - will be stored in a secure, NIH-controlled database. 'This is a novel and historic agreement,' NIH director Dr Francis Collins told reporters, one that will 'protect the family's interest and also further their commitment to biomedical research.' Collins and bioethicist Kathy Hudson, NIH deputy director for science, outreach, and policy, wrote about the agreement in an essay in Nature published on Wednesday. The decision applies only to researchers funded by NIH, which said it 'encourages' other scientists to abide by the agreement. Because DNA-sequencing technology is cheap and ubiquitous in genetics labs, the HeLa genome has been partly sequenced many times, and can easily be fully sequenced again. 'Sequencing' refers to determining the precise order of the chemical letters on a person's genome, which is the full library of his or her genetic information. Bits and pieces of that sequence spell out, for instance, whether someone is at risk of diabetes or Alzheimer's or other genetic traits, as well as personal traits like the consistency of ear wax. In this July 30, 2013 photo, a researcher places HeLa cells - which were derived from Lacks' genome data - in an incubator at a lab at the National Cancer Institute . These loopholes in the access agreement significantly weaken the NIH move, said Mark Gerstein, a computational biologist at Yale University who has raised concerns about threats to genetic privacy. 'I doubt NIH will get blanket agreement from scientists in every country' to follow its protocol, 'so it's not clear what the agreement will be able to accomplish.' Collins emphasized that the plan to control access to the HeLa genome is a unique response to the fact that Lacks' descendants are publicly known. 'This should not be used to set a precedent for other cell lines,' he said. Under U.S. guidelines, it is still possible to use biological samples 'to generate whole-genome sequencing data without the knowledge or permission of the person providing the sample,' Collins and Hudson noted, as long as the specimen cannot be matched to a named person. But thanks to technological advances, nonidentifiability is increasingly illusory. Earlier this year scientists led by Yaniv Erlich of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reported that they had managed to identify one person whose genome data - supposedly cloaked in anonymity - had been published, and could do so for others. All it took was cross-referencing genomic data with publicly available genealogical, DNA and other information, they reported. This undated scanning electron micrograph image shows HeLa cells. The cancerous cells, originally taken from Henrietta Lacks in 1951, were the first human cells that could be grown indefinitely in a laboratory . NIH's decision to control access to the HeLa genome was prompted by a recent scientific paper that many geneticists and bioethicists viewed as one more insult to Lacks and her family. In February 1951, physicians at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore took a biopsy of Lacks' aggressive cervical cancer when the tobacco farmer and mother of five was 31. The tissue sample, taken without her knowledge, gave rise to the first line of human cells that could grow endlessly in lab dishes. Lacks died eight months later, decades before federal law prohibited taking biological samples without consent. Her cells, however, seem immortal, and have been used for both basic biomedical research and the development of polio and other vaccines, cancer therapies, in vitro fertilization techniques, and drugs for herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson's disease. Although HeLa cells came from a tumor, that does not prevent them from being used to study some normal processes. For decades her children did not know that her cells - the subject of more than 74,000 scientific papers - were being used. Many were profoundly disturbed when they learned that part of the mother who was taken from them as a young woman lived on in labs that did not even know that 'HeLa' stood for a real person. Rebecca Skloot's 2010 book about the origin of HeLa cells began to right that wrong. But the family was 'shocked and disappointed' last March, said granddaughter Jeri Lacks Whye, when researchers in Germany published a paper that revealed the full HeLa genome. The European Molecular Biology Laboratory, which posted the HeLa genome sequence in an open-access database, said at the time: 'We cannot infer anything about Henrietta Lacks's genome, or of her descendants, from the data generated in this study.' In fact, with readily available online tools that translate sequence data, an expert could infer what disease genes and other DNA Lacks' descendants carry. The information 'was out there for anyone to view with a click of a button,' Whye said. 'It seemed like history was repeating itself' as scientists exploited HeLa cells with no consideration for Henrietta's family. Skloot brought the paper to the attention of the family and the NIH's Collins. When the family asked the German researchers to remove the DNA data from the public database where they had posted it, they did so. It had been posted for several days. The episode prompted NIH, encouraged by Skloot, to meet with the Lacks family. The result is the new agreement, which Collins called 'a path forward that respects (the family's) wishes and allows science to progress.' CONTROLLING ACCESS . A newly formed group at the NIH will review scientists' applications for access to the full genome sequence data from HeLa cells. The six members - composed of scientists, bioethicists and two of Lacks' descendants - will base its decision on whether the researchers are doing biomedical research, promise to keep DNA-sequence data in a secure location, do not contact the family, and disclose any commercial interests. In addition, researchers who receive NIH funding will be expected to deposit further sequencing data from HeLa cells into an NIH database that scientists will access through this process. They will also be asked to include in their publications and presentations 'an acknowledgement and expression of gratitude to the Lacks family,' NIH said, much as they acknowledge their source of funding. 'The Lacks family is honored to be part of an important agreement that we believe will be beneficial to everyone,' Whye said. More than 60 years after Lacks' cells were taken, they are still the basis for groundbreaking science. In this week's Nature, scientists report that they may have solved the mystery of why Lacks' cells have been able to survive and proliferate in labs for 60 years, giving rise to innumerable cell lines, where other cancer and normal cells die out. The human papilloma virus, which causes cervical cancer, apparently inserted itself near a cancer-causing gene on chromosome 8 in Lacks' genome, found Jay Shendure of the University of Washington and his colleagues. The HPV activated the 'oncogene,' perhaps accounting for the aggressiveness of the cancer that killed Lacks as well as HeLa cells' ability to reproduce every 24 hours and never stop.","Scientists took Henrietta Lacks' cancer cells without her permission 62 years .

A Seattle author and mother-of-two has penned her own heartbreaking but humorous obituary before she died of cancer. Jane Catherine Lotter, 60, was described by loved ones as a strong minded woman with great spunk who knew from an early age that she loved to write so it came as no surprise to her family when she told them she wanted to have the final word on her life. They'd never heard of someone doing that before but her daughter, Tessa, immediately replied: 'Of course you are.' And it didn't disappoint. Beloved husband: 'Bobby M, I love you up to the sky,' she wrote of her husband, Bob Marts, pictured with her in their youth . The paid obituary was published in The Seattle Times on July 28 - 10 days after she passed away peacefully at home surrounded by her beloved husband and children. Poignantly displaying her wit, charm, lust for life and love for her family and friends, Lotter spoke to the reader from beyond the grave, or more accurately, from Elliott Bay, where her ashes were scattered. Lotter began: 'One of the few . advantages of dying from Grade 3, Stage IIIC endometrial cancer, . recurrent and metastasized to the liver and abdomen, is that you have . time to write your own obituary. (The other advantages are no longer . bothering with sunscreen and no longer worrying about your . cholesterol.)' Journalists . around the United States were so taken with the obituary, they posted . it on their Twitter feeds and it has been reprinted in newspapers . including the New York Times. Final words: Jane Catherine Lotter, 60, pictured left and right, was described by loved ones as a strong minded woman with great spunk . Loved ones: Jane, pictured left with her sister Barbara in 2012, and right died from Grade 3, Stage IIIC endometrial cancer last month . The author stuck to traditional . obituary style for much of the piece, describing how she was born in . Seattle on August 10, 1952, graduated from the University of Washington . and was survived by her husband of 29 years, Bob Marts, and their two . adult children, Tessa and Riley. But she also got personal, particularly with reference to her family, and the result was tear-jerkingly beautiful. 'Bobby . M, I love you up to the sky,' she wrote, adding that the night they met . - November 22, 1975 at the Central Tavern in Pioneer Square - was the . 'luckiest night of my life.' 'Thank you for all the laughter and the love, and for standing by me at the end.' To her children, she wrote 'Tessa and Riley, I love you so much, and I'm so proud of you. I wish you such good things,' before offering some life advice. 'May you, every day, connect with the brilliancy of your own spirit. And may you always remember that obstacles in the path are not obstacles, they ARE the path.' Author: Lotter, pictured as a young woman, was a freelance writer, editor, and proofreader . Sisters: Jane, pictured left in 1961, was survived by her sisters Julie, center, and Barbara, right and another sister Kathleen . Describing her achievements as a . freelance writer, editor and proofreader is where her humor shines, and . she even managed a final plug to her 2009 novel The Bette Davis Club. 'I . received a First Place Society of Professional Journalists award for . Humorous Writing for my column Jane Explains... I would demonstrate my . keen sense of humor by telling a few jokes here, but the Times charges . for these listings by the column inch and we must move on.' Lotter learned in early 2010 that she had uterine cancer and went through intense treatment. But . last year, when the illness came back and was terminal, she said she . 'decided to be joyful about having had a full life, rather than sad . about having to die. Amazingly, this outlook worked for me. (Well, you . know, most of the time.)' Beautiful day, happy to be here: Marts gave out buttons at Lotter's memorial service with the sign off she used in her obituary . Meditation and a study of Buddist philosophy helped her accept what she couldn't change, she explained. 'At . any rate, I am at peace. And on that upbeat note, I take my mortal . leave of this rollicking, revolving world - this sun, that moon, that . walk around Green Lake, that stroll through the Pike Place Market, the . memory of a child's hand in mine.' Lotter took advantage of Washington State's Death With Dignity Act, however her husband told The New York Times that 'suicide was the opposite of how Jane saw her life.' 'She loved life. She just didn't want to end up like a fish flopping on a dock,' he said this week. Towards the end of her obituary, Lotter wrote, poetically: 'I was given the gift of life, and now I have to give it back. This is hard. But I was a lucky woman, who led a lucky existence, and for this I am grateful. 'My beloved Bob, Tessa, and Riley. My beloved friends and family. How precious you all have been to me. Knowing and loving each one of you was the success story of my life. Metaphorically speaking, we will meet again, joyfully, on the other side.' Signing off, the brave woman wrote: 'Beautiful day, happy to have been here.'","Jane Catherine Lotter's paid obituary was published in The Seattle Times on July 28, 10 days after she passed away .

NBC’s Brian Williams has long been considered one of America’s favorite news anchors, but his skills as a hip hop MC had for too long gone unnoticed until ‘Late Night’ host Jimmy Fallon recently revealed all. Back in June, Fallon featured Williams hitting up some 90s West Coast flavor with a mash-up of Warren G’s 'Regulate' and Dr Dre's 'Nuthin but a 'G' Thang', but on Tuesday night's show it was time for Brian to get old skool (sic) with a blast of Young MC’s classic 80s cut ‘Bust A Move.’ The hilarious footage was created by splicing together Williams' words from countless news broadcasts to create an almost seamless mash-up of the first and second verses of the 1989 classic all about the age-old story of boys trying to impress the ladies. Scroll Down for Video . Badass MC Brian Williams rocks it in his own inimitable style with a hilarious version of a hip hop classic . ‘Bust A Move’ was a top ten hit for the Young MC back in 1989 and won a Grammy the following year for ‘Best Rap Performance’. It has since passed into hip hop folklore and was even covered on an early episode of ‘Glee’. The world waits with baited breath to see which rap classic Williams’ decides to tackle next. He is currently taking a break from anchoring NBC Nightly News after telling viewers during last Thursday's show that he was having a complete knee replacement. The footage splices together the words of the song from footage countless clips of Williams reporting for NBC .

The surgery isn't because someone has popped a cap in it, jealous of his rapping skills, but because he damaged it a high school football game decades ago. Williams discussed the knee replacement surgery in a Nightly News segment last Thursday about the procedure by Dr. Nancy Snyderman. 'If . you don't see me around here for a while, this is the reason why,' he . said, describing the 'helmet to the knee' injury he suffered playing . high school football. 'I have been in pain for 35 years,' said Williams. 'I have paid a very high price from what's been confirmed . to be the single worst New Jersey high school Catholic League football . career in history,' he joked. Lester Holt will anchor the nightly news while Williams is away. Williams, 54, said he's had three . previous surgeries on his right knee but the pain was becoming more of . an issue. When it began costing him sleep, Williams said he realized it . was time to take care of it. 'If this doesn't go perfectly, it can't hurt any more than it does now,' he said. Hip Hop heavyweights: Young MC, left, and NBC's Brian Williams giving the camera his best blue steel pose . Snyderman said most people who have knee replacement surgery miss between three weeks and three months of work, depending on the physical nature of their jobs. Full recovery takes between six months and a year. Williams joked during an appearance on David Letterman's Late Show two weeks ago that 'I want to come back almost a little too early gooned on medication. I think it will be great viewing.' His newscast showed a rare sign of ratings vulnerability last week.

Bosses at a hospital trust with the highest mortality rate in England spend hundreds of pounds on two taxi trips across London. Tony Halsall, the disgraced chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay, and his board of directors took two minibuses costing the taxpayer £550 on a journey that could have cost as little as £63 each way on public transport. They were in the capital for a meeting with Monitor which oversees the Foundation status process. While there during the trip in April 2009 they stayed at the £200-a-night City Inn, Westminster. Write caption here . The cost of the taxi trip came from a return trip in a 16-seater minibus costing £275 each way. Had they taken the Victoria Line tube from Euston to Pimlico and walked the short distance to the hotel, it would have cost them a total of just £63 each way. The journey was taken before Mr Halsall was forced to step down as chief executive in 2012, after the trust was exposed as having the highest mortality rate in England. The matter sparked a police investigation into the trust's failings following the death of nine-day-old Joshua Titcombe, who died at Furness General Hospital in 2008 after staff failed to spot and treat an infection. A Care Quality Commission report published in June this year revealed that there had been a ‘cover up’ of neglect at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria. The trust faces at least 30 civil negligence claims. However, despite the fallout Halsall will continue to claim his full £150,606 salary until October. Among the disgraced chief’s spending of £10,055, which ran from January 2009 to February 2012, was a £3,249 stay for 15 board members in the City Inn in Westminster, now owned by hotel chain Hilton, in £200-plus rooms. Excess: Bosses at University Hospitals of Morecombe Bay Trust spent hundreds of pounds on a taxi rather than take the Tube. Above, Furness Hospital, where staff failed to spot Joshua Titcombe had picked up an infection . A separate staff trip in 2010 to visit the headquarters of clinical software company Lorenzo cost the trust £804 in airfare alone to transport ‘key clinical staff’ to its Chennai base in India. Mr Halsall also splashed out £334 on flowers for eight members of staff in June 2010 and a further £48 on flowers for one member of staff the following year. The trust has said strict guidelines are in place and Mr Halsall had spent the money legitimately. Tim Bennett, director of finance and information at the trust, said: “The chief executive credit card is used for the legitimate business expenses of not only the chief executive, but other appropriate staff within the trust. 'Therefore, it is important to note that not all the expenses shown in the Freedom of Information request response related to the former chief executive. 'This is no different than in many other organisations, and in some cases, can offer better value. 'For example, the cost associated with the travel and accommodation of the whole trust board (consisting of 15 individuals), to take part in a required meeting in Central London with the trust’s regulator, Monitor, as part of its foundation trust application in 2009. 'Any expenses incurred on the corporate credit card account must be in line with the rules governing its use, which ensure that only legitimate business expenses can be claimed for. 'For each instance the card is used, a separate form is required with all receipts attached. These are independently verified by the trust’s finance department as part of the payment process.'","Bosses racked up the excessive bill while their hospitals were in crisis .

A California teen, his mother and a friend were arrested Tuesday in connection with the violent murder of his ex-girlfriend’s father. Edward 'Anthony' Morales and Richard Gonzalez, both 18, have been accused of abducting and brutally murdering Alejandro Padilla July 26 as revenge for the father trying to protect his daughter from the violent teen. Morales’ mother, Alma Casada, 37, was arrested and accused of being an accomplice to the brutal slaying, according to reports. Padilla, 40, was found July 27 by police in the backseat of his burned-out car in Fontana, CA., reports said. Baby faced killer?: Edward Anthony Morales, 18, is accused of murdering Alejandro Padilla, 40, simply because the man was trying to protect his daughter . Cops allege Morales and Gonzalez savagely beat Padilla the morning of July 26 with a baseball bat, splattering the helpless man’s blood all over his driveway, garage door and the side of his home. The teens then took him to a local park where the set his car on fire with him in the back seat. Investigators recovered the bat at Padilla's house, according to KTLA. 'It's just heartbreaking to know that somebody like him, a young kid, could do something this harmful to an innocent man,' family friend Valerie Granados told KTLA. It is not clear if Padilla was alive when the car was set ablaze, it also not clear exactly how Casada is involved in the murder. When contacted by Mail Online, Fontana Police declined to comment. 'In my heart, I was hoping that person wasn't involved, we prayed that he wasn't invovled,' Alejandro Padilla's mourning widow Lilliana Pelayo told reporters. Say cheese!: Richard Gonzalez, 18, likely wasn't smiling when he was booked in connection with the murder of Alejandro Padilla . How could they?: Alma Casada (left in both pictures) and son Edward  Anthony Morales (right in both pictures) are both accused of being involved in the murder of Alejandro Padilla . Beloved: Alejandro Padilla, 40, had no criminal record and no enemies, according to friends and family . Morales, referred to as Anthony by family and friends, dated Alejandro Padilla’s daughter Emily, 18, for about a year before she broke up with him, family members told KTLA. The troubled Morales did not take the breakup well, becoming angry and violent, according to a family friend. ‘Anthony seemed pretty obsessed with Emily,’ Tony Granados told KTLA. Morales allegedly kept harassing the young woman after the end of their relationship to the point that Alejandro Padilla felt it necessary to seek an order of protection to protect his daughter, friends told KTLA. ‘He was having problems with Anthony, basically trying to keep Anthony away from his daughter,’ Granados told the station. Heartbroken: Emily Padilla, 18, pleads July 26 for her father's killer to come forward . Family man: Padilla leaves behind a wife and two daughters . Savage beating: Alejandro Padilla's blood was smeared on his garage door when he was beaten in his driveway with a baseball bat prior to his abduction, according to officials . Horrific: Padilla's blood was splattered along the side of his house during the violent beating that led to his death . When Alejandro Padilla first went missing, cops initially believed it may have been a case of mistaken identity. Family members speaking to the media only hours after their beloved father and husband went missing were in disbelief he was missing. ‘I can’t think of anybody that would want to hurt him,’ Pelayo said between tears. ‘It's just too hard to believe,’ daughter Danielle Padilla said. ‘It seems so surreal. It seems like a nightmare. I just want to wake up,’ daughter Danielle Padilla sobbed. Soon after the Alejandro Padilla’s charred body was found in his scorched 2009 Nissan Versa at a park about six miles from the family’s home, and prior to any suspects being named, a heartbroken Emily Padilla pleaded with the murder to come forward. Inconsolable: Lilliana Pelayo, Padilla's widow, said she 'prayed' that Morales wasn't involved in her husband's death . Locked up: Morales and Casada are now in jail awaiting trial . ‘He doesn’t deserve this. Nobody deserves this…I know that if you were in my position, you’d want to find who killed your father,’ she tearfully said. The loving father had no criminal history, not even a speeding ticket, according to KTLA, and was said to have no enemies, according to the Fontana Herald, initially leaving investigators clueless and leading to his inconsolable family to put up $10,000 reward for the capture of his killer. All three suspects were arrested without incident, the Herald reported.

A nature-lover has completed a barking challenge of travelling across Europe to climb a different tree every day for a year. Henrik Dahle, 36, clambered up the branches of 365 trees on his journey through 10 countries. He scaled trees almost 100ft (30metres) high during and spent between 10 and 90 minutes a day climbing. Barking: Henrik Dahle causes a bit of a stir as he climbs a tree in Chiavaria, Italy, during his year long challenge . Nice view: Dahle climbed a tree every day for a year as he travelled around 10 countries . Mr Dahle, from Southampton, Hampshire, loved climbing trees as a child and said he wanted to experience the thrill of the adventure again. He left the UK and took a tree-climbing road trip across France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Holland, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. He also interviewed 80 people in the boughs of various pine, ash, oak, beech, silver birch and poplar trees to keep his mission interesting. One of his most notable conquests was ascending a Norwegian spruce, which later was used for London's Trafalgar Square Christmas Tree. He also climbed a tree in Norway on Christmas Eve dressed as Santa in minus 23 degrees temperature. Mr Dahle said: 'Climbing a different tree every day for a year was a personal challenge. 'At first, I took a short part of the day out to find a tree and climb it, fitting it in around my everyday life. Challenge: Dahle said he wanted to raise awareness about 'sustainability and staying in touch with nature' Festive: Nature lover climbed this Norwegian spruce which then became Trafalgar Square's Christmas Tree . Don't look down: Dahle climbed trees almost 100ft high during his travels . 'But as the project went on it took up more and more of my time and took over. 'I . soon realised it was going to get boring if it was just me, so I . started to invite other people to join me and interviewed them up trees.' Mr Dahle said he got the acorn for the unusual endeavour at a friend's party. He said: 'Everyone was playing a game, messing around putting a pirate hat up a tree. 'I ended up joining in and it reminded me how much I enjoyed climbing trees as a kid. 'An idea came to me of holding an acorn in my hand and saying 'I am going to climb this tree. 'It's a sign of hope that the tree will grow and be big enough for me to climb, and that I'll still be around to do it.' Henrik went travelling with six friends, regularly making them pull over so he could climb his next tree.

He said: 'I'm passionate about sustainability and staying in touch with nature. 'People were usually keen and excited when I told them about the project, and a bit curious about why I was doing it. 'When it was over, it felt very strange. You'd think I'd feel relieved but I had become so used to looking for the next tree it was odd not to anymore.'

His family - some of whom had not seen him since he was a baby - joined him up his last tree, in Norway, for a 'family tree' party. Mr Dahle, whose father is Norwegian, said: 'I loved the family tree, that might be my favourite. 'I'm sure some of my relatives were just humouring me, but they showed up.' One of his earliest memories is from the age of three, when his brother made him climb a tree in the New Forest, Hants, in a game.

Police are looking for a thief who tried to steal a service dog from a woman with cerebral palsy – and the boneheaded attempt was caught on camera. Surveillance footage caught the alleged crook Monday trying to steal a service dog from Arrica Okenka, 30, on a Toldeo, OH. bus. Officials haven’t yet identified the suspect and are asking for the public’s help. SCROLL DOWN FOR FULL VIDEO . Thug: An unidentified man tried to steal a disabled woman's service dog Monday on a Toledo, OH bus . Okenka has had the dog named Ingrid for four years, and usually does not hold its leash. Monday she held tight as the would-be dog snatcher yanked in vein and then ran off the bus after a few unsuccessful pulls. ‘I wasn't letting go I had a death grip on her. He would have had to drag me off the bus with her,’ Okenka told WTVG. Ingrid usually lies at Okenka’s side without her leash being held, even on the bus, because of how well trainedthe dog is, she told the Toledo Blade. ‘A lot of times, I don't have a hold of her leash, because she's so trained, I just let her lay down,’ Okenka told the paper, adding ‘once I realized what he was doing, I really wasn't letting go.’ Standing guard: Ingrid, the service dog, stood guard by owner Arrica Okenka, 30, after the thief's attempt . Talker: The would-be dog-snatcher tried to make small talk with Okenka before taking the loyal pooch . The dog owner held the leash so tightly it cut her hand, she told WTVG. The man tried to distract Okenka with a conversation about the dog, she told the paper, adding that he strangely hit the stop-request bell twice before the bus made it to a local shopping mall. Ingrid helps Okenka with almost everything, from dressing and undressing to opening and closing doors, picking up things she drops and other routine tasks, she told the Blade. Okenka was befuddled as to why the man would want Ingrid, telling WTVG that maybe he wanted to use her for fighting and wondering to the Blade if he thought he could sell the dog because of her training. Good dog: Ingrid helps Okenka with everything, from dressing and undressing to picking up dropped and opening doors . The dog would not be of much use to anyone else, Okenka explained to the paper. ‘She's trained to do them for me, you can drop things all day long and she's just going to look at you,’ Okenka said. The disabled woman is happy to still have her beloved Ingrid, she told the paper, and plans to make sure no one can try to take the dog again. ‘She's so smart I almost don't have to put her on a leash. I do that because you're supposed to do it, you're supposed to leash your dog. And now I'll definitely keep her on that leash forever.’","Arrica Okenka, the dog's owner has cerebral palsy, needs the dog for almost all routine tasks .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:30 EST, 7 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:56 EST, 7 August 2013 . Army Pfc. Bradley Manning being escorted out of court last Tuesday after being found guilty of leaking classified information . The father of Army Pfc Bradley Manning, convicted last week of leaking classified information, refuses to accept that his son is guilty of his crimes and believes he was simply ‘grandstanding’ in court. Brian Manning, of Oklahoma City, said he can't understand how someone could obtain so much classified information and smuggle it out of a supposedly secure workplace without being detected. Bradley Manning said he downloaded the material onto his workplace computer, transferred it to CDs and then used his personal computer to send it to WikiLeaks. But his father has dismissed his son's courtroom statement that he leaked the material as ‘grandstanding.’ ‘He was used to running his life on his own, he was a man of the house, and he had problems adjusting to that, so I feel part of that was he had a lot of pride,’ Brian Manning told CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360 on Tuesday evening. A former Navy technician, Brian Manning said it would be wrong to leak classified information that would damage the United States and its military. He said he loves his son but that if he could speak freely with him, ‘I would basically tell him right off the bat that he had no excuse whatsoever for allegedly releasing that information.’ Manning, who is in prison currently awaiting sentencing, hasn't spoken to his father in months. Brian Manning, of Oklahoma City, dismissed his son's courtroom statement that he leaked the material as 'grandstanding' On Tuesday his sentence for disclosing classified information was trimmed from 136 years to 90 years by a military judge who said some of his offenses were closely related. The ruling was largely a victory for defense attorneys, who had argued for an 80-year maximum. Still, the 25-year-old soldier could spend most, if not all, of his remaining years inside a prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The sentencing phase of Manning's court-martial is in its second week. He was convicted last week of 20 counts, including six Espionage Act violations, five federal theft counts and a federal computer fraud charge for leaking more than 700,000 documents from a classified government computer network while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2010. Manning says he leaked the material to expose wrongdoing by the military and U.S. diplomats. Bradley Manning was born in 1987 to a father, Brian Manning, who was in the military and often absent . He contends he selectively leaked material that wouldn't harm service members or national security. At his sentencing hearing, prosecutors are presenting evidence that the leaks damaged U.S. interests. They have focused mainly on the impact of more than 250,000 State Department diplomatic cables that WikiLeaks began publishing in November 2010. Maj. Gen. Michael Nagata testified for the prosecution on Tuesday that the leaked cables had an impact on U.S. military operations in Pakistan, where he was deputy commander of a defense office within the U.S. embassy in Islamabad. Nagata saved the details of the impact for a closed court session to protect classified information. Video: Watch Brian Manning speak with Anderson Cooper . Manning was convicted last week of leaking more than 700,000 documents from a classified government computer network while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2010 . The leaked cables publicly revealed a closer U.S.-Pakistani military relationship than Pakistan had publicly acknowledged. The cables also disclosed U.S. concerns Islamist militants could get their hands on Pakistani nuclear material to make an illicit weapon. One leaked cable revealed that instructors at a prestigious Pakistani defense institution were giving anti-American lessons to senior officers. U.S. officials said in 2010 the leaked cables may have endangered operatives inside Afghanistan and Pakistan who had worked against the Taliban or al-Qaida. However, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said at the time that cables implying some Pakistani intelligence officials were aiding insurgents were ‘clearly out of step with where this relationship is now, and has been heading for some time.’ Prosecutors also have presented evidence the disclosures damaged America's military and diplomatic relationships with some foreign governments and endangered the lives of foreign citizens who had confided in diplomats.","Brian Manning don't believe his son could have leaked all the information he has admitted too .

More than 300 aeroplane passengers were delayed for 48 hours without proper food at an airport after a flight developed a technical fault. The Airblue flight was due to fly from Manchester Airport to Islamabad in Pakistan, at 9.50pm on Friday - and passengers were fed chips and beans to keep them going during the delays. Passengers spent Friday night in hotels in Manchester and then returned to the airport to wait for the flight again on Saturday - but were later told it was being delayed until 3pm yesterday. Waiting game: The Airblue flight was due to fly from Manchester Airport to Islamabad in Pakistan, at 9.50pm on Friday - but passengers were fed chips and beans to keep them going during the delays . Airline officials then offered to put up the irate passengers in a hotel some 80 miles away in Birmingham, West Midlands, because they said there were no rooms available in Manchester. Most refused the offer and slept overnight in the airport, which is located south of Manchester city centre, only to find the plane again missed its take-off slot. The flight finally took off late last night. But that meant delays for the passengers who were booked to go on that plane - who were told they would be delayed for 24 hours. Some travellers said that the delays had left families in tears. Matthew Miller, 38, was originally due to catch a flight on Tuesday evening but it was cancelled. So when he turned up to catch the plane on Friday night, he was furious to find he was grounded again. He said: ‘I’m a maths teacher and the . term is about to start in Pakistan. I thought I’d be getting back in . good time but as it is I’ll be lucky to get there by Monday. The mood is . terrible. Stressful: Passengers spent Friday night in hotels in Manchester and then returned to the airport to wait for the flight again on Saturday - but were later told it was being delayed until 3pm yesterday . ‘People are shouting and in tears. The airline just aren’t communicating with us - over the whole time they have given us about 40 minutes. The food is chips and beans.’ 'People are shouting and in tears. The airline just aren’t communicating with us. The food is chips and beans' Matthew Miller, passenger . A passenger named Javed told BBC Five Live on Saturday night: ‘It has to be seen to be believed. 'There's 300 people here. Children, diabetics, non-English speaking people that can't even understand the tannoys. I'm seeing people making expensive phone calls to Pakistan. 'I'm seeing people that cannot keep . their fasts. I see people that have no access to food when it comes to . opening their fasts. It is a shambles and an embarrassment to British . society. 'To keep saying we will inform you in . two hours, and in two hours they say: “We will inform you in two hours”. I've chosen to eat virtually nothing because I didn't want to have . chips and beans again.' Carrier: Islamabad-based Airblue is Pakistan's second biggest airline. A file photo of one of its planes is seen . Ordeal: Most passengers slept overnight in the airport (file picture), which is located south of Manchester city centre, only to find the plane again missed its take-off slot. The flight finally took off late last night . Many passengers spent Saturday night in Manchester Airport rather than travel to the accommodation offered by the airline about 80 miles away in Birmingham. 'There's 300 people here. Children, diabetics, non-English speaking people that can't even understand the tannoys. It is a shambles and an embarrassment to British society' Javed, passenger . A Manchester Airport spokesman said: ‘They are working on the problem with the current aircraft. The passengers who were supposed to be on the 10pm flight on Sunday have been informed at home.’ ‘The staff on the ground are doing their best to help sort out accommodation and food but the majority of the communication has to come from the airline. We are doing what we can. ‘Understandably passengers are frustrated and we can only apologise for the delay.’ Islamabad-based Airblue is Pakistan’s second biggest airline. Nobody was available to be contacted last night, although a spokesman previously said passengers were offered ‘every compensation’. Standing around: Delays at London Heathrow Airport's Terminal One three months ago . Under new EU rules, airlines must pay compensation for cancelled or heavily delayed flights, unless there are 'extraordinary circumstances'. This can include sudden severe weather events, such as a hurricane or something like the volcanic ash cloud episode of 2010. The ruling that outlines these rights is Regulation (EC) 261/2004, which became law earlier this year. Compensation is around £210 for inter-EU flights of 930 miles or less, £330 for flights between 930 and 1,860 miles and £500 for other journeys. It applies to any flight leaving an EU airport and any flight into the EU on an EU-based airline. Passengers can claim by telling the airline their flight number, names and reason for the delay. If rejected, they can take their case to court. In essence, if your flight is delayed by more than three hours, cancelled or overbooked, you may be able to claim.","Airblue flight was due to fly from Manchester to Islamabad on Friday .

A woman convicted of going on a killing spree with her boyfriend 55 years ago that left 11 people dead and whose story inspired the hit 1973 film 'Badlands' has been badly injured in a car crash in Michigan. Caril Ann Clair, 70, of Stryker, Ohio, is in critical condition after the single-vehicle crash on Monday night that killed her 81-year-old husband, Frederick Clair, on northbound Interstate 69 in Calhoun County. Over a month in late 1957 and 1958, when Clair, then named Fugate, was just 14, she and her 19-year-old boyfriend, Charlie Starkweather, terrorized Nebraska and Wyoming, killing Fugate's . mother, stepfather, two-year-old sister and eight others.

Critically injured: Caril Clair, pictured left as a teen, and right, in 1993, was taken to Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo following Monday night's crash . The horrific rampage became the basis of the film 'Badlands' starring Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek. In 1975, Spacek was nominated Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles at the BAFTA awards. The film follows Kit Carruthers, a young garbage collector, played by Sheen, and his girlfriend Holly Sargis, played by Spacek, from Fort Dupree, South Dakota, who are on run after killing Holly's father because he disagreed with their relationship. On their way towards the Badlands of Montana they leave a trail of dispassionate and seemingly random murders. The film received rave reviews at film festivals including The New York Film Festival. Bruce Springsteen also sang about Starkweather and Miss Fugate on his 'Nebraska' album. Fugate always maintained she was innocent but a jury found her guilty in the robbery and murder of a 17-year-old boy.

Roger Temple, 44, was missing for seven weeks before being arrested Sunday in Manhattan for petty shoplifting. Upon being released he promptly went back off-the-grid. Temple was busted Sunday night for stealing peanuts from a Washington Heights bodega, according to reports. Have you seen this man?: Richard Temple has been missing for almost two months . The missing man was last seen at his home June 19, his last contact was a June 20 text message to his girlfriend, according to the Bernardsville News. His whereabouts were unknown until he was snagged by police for trying to five-finger discount a $2 bag of peanuts, NJ.com said. ‘He got picked up, fingerprinted and processed for this minor shoplifting charge,’ Bedminster Police Chief Patrick Ussery told the site. The arresting officer did not run Temple’s details through the National Crime Information Center, would have flagged him as missing, the News reported. ‘Unfortunately, at the time of processing they didn't run him through NCIC or didn't get a result which would have given us immediate notification,’ Ussery told NJ.com. It wasn’t until after Temple was released back into the wild that his prints were put into NCIC and flagged, prompting Somerset County (NJ) dispatch to notify Bedminster Police of the arrest, Bedminster Patch reported. Help find Richard Temple: The missing man's family is offering a $2,000 reward for information that leads to his discovery . Avid hiker: Local police searched the hills around Temple's home and did not find him . Since going dark, Temple’s cell phone has been turned off – he previously called his girlfriend every morning – and he has not had any bank or credit card activity, the News said. He also left his passport at home and left with only his backpack. Bedminster Police will contact the NYPD for a mugshot and information about Temple’s condition at the time of his arrest, including his mental state, the News reported. Had the arresting officer been aware Temple was reported missing, he could only urge him to contact loved ones, Patch reported. He has not been seen or heard from since the arrest. ‘We would have liked him to contact his family and friends, but we didn't get that opportunity,’ Ussery told NJ.com. ‘All we can say is that NYPD had contact with our missing person, and we still consider him missing and endangered.’ Off the grid: Temple has not used his cell phone, credit or debit cards since disappearing in June . First made public in a June 27 press release from the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office, Temple’s disappearance has baffled family, friends and investigators. A number of non-profits, including Crime Stoppers of Somerset County and LostNMissing, have spearheaded the effort to find Temple with billboards across northern New Jersey. Police have also combed the woods around Temple’s home looking for the avid hiker as well. Temple’s family has set up a Facebook page and offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to his discovery. Additionally, his brother Nick Temple is planning to fly from England to aid in the search, according to the News. Described as 5-foot-8, 175 pounds, with hazel eyes, greying hair and a mole on the left side of his nose, anyone who sees Temple is urged to call Crime Stoppers at 1-88-577-TIPS (8477).","Richard Temple has been missing since June 19 .

The high-school teacher who is accused of having had an affair with Simon Cowell's pregnant lover when she was a student has denied the claims. Steven Lewis allegedly enjoyed a relationship with 16-year-old Lauren Silverman when he was teaching English at a £19,000-a-year private school in Florida, with both of them leaving the institution after the friendship was found out. But yesterday he insisted that the pair did not have an affair - although he confessed to a 'drunken phone call' and said he was 'eternally sorry and remorseful' for his inappropriate behaviour. Denial: Former teacher Steven Lewis, pictured with his wife Michelle, insists he did not have an affair with his then-student Lauren Silverman . Affair: Simon Cowell holidaying on a yacht with Lauren Silverman earlier this year before she was pregnant . Mrs Silverman was catapulted to global fame last week when it emerged that she was pregnant with Mr Cowell's baby and was divorcing her husband Andrew, a friend of the X Factor mogul. The Mail on Sunday reported that when Mrs Silverman, then called Lauren Davis, was in high school she caused a scandal by having an 'improper relationship' with Mr Lewis, who was 10 years her senior and was married. Schoolgirl: Lauren Silverman, then called Lauren Davis, in her fifth-grade yearbook photo . Classmates at Miami Country Day School said that the pair had dated for a month and a half, and that their 'affair' was discovered by her mother, leading Mr Lewis to be sacked while the teenager was transferred to another school. However, Mr Lewis has insisted that this report is inaccurate, and claimed that he was a 'victim' of the high-profile relationship between Mrs Silverman and Mr Cowell. 'There was never any month, month and a half or two-month affair between me and a student,' he told the New York Daily News in an impassioned email. 'There was a drunken phone call, late at night, for which I am eternally sorry and remorseful and for which I resigned the following day OVER 20 YEARS AGO.' The ex-teacher added: 'Was I naive and even a bit flirtatious with someone nine years my junior? Yes.' Mr Lewis' father Peter told the Mail on Sunday last week that the scandal over the relationship had caused his son to quit teaching for good. 'He had to leave town because of this bimbo,' he said. 'After he left the school, Steve worked for FedEx and worked for a rental car agency and then his wife got a job in Idaho over ten years ago. They have since moved to Montana.' But Steven Lewis claimed that he had moved in order to get a better job. Lauren Silvermen, seen yesterday buying coffee in Bridgehampton, New York, has catapulted to global fame . Together: Mrs Silverman, who is divorcing her husband, pictured with Mr Cowell last year . Out and about: The socialite has not revealed how her relationship with the X Factor mogul started . He also claimed that he had been unable to escape the furore which has erupted over his connection to Mrs Silverman, pointing out that unlike Mr Cowell he cannot simply flee the country to avoid publicity. Her classmate Jerry Raphaelson said of the alleged affair: 'It was a relationship that went on for a month and a half. Virtually all the students knew about it. She was one of the good-looking, popular kids - part of the ""in"" crowd. 'Steve was our English teacher. He was a very good-looking guy, high-energy, personable and very charismatic. Everyone loved him. 'He was as charming as can be. He was very outgoing, very social. He'd pat you on the back, give you a hug.' Mr Lewis has remained with his wife Michelle, whom he married before the alleged relationship with his student.

Veteran TV weatherman Bill Giles has written a book accusing his fellow BBC forecasters of plotting to oust him from the team. The retired 73-year-old, who led the BBC's team of on-screen forecasters for 17 years from 1983, accuses colleagues of plotting, back-stabbing and bitter rivalry in his book 'You Have Wives?', which is set to be published next year. Giles claims Michael Fish - who he claims 'never did like me' - and John Kettley were behind a secret plot to overthrow him. Storm approaching: Bill Giles, who spent 17 years at the helm of the BBC's team of on-screen weather forecasters, claims things weren't so sunny behind the scenes . Revealing a lengthy feud with Fish, Giles said his rapid rise up the ranks of the Met Office upset his colleague. ‘Michael never did like me ever since I appeared on TV a year after him, got promotion, and in 1983 came back as his boss.’Fish will forever be famous for his television blunder hours before a devastating hurricane hit the country in October 1987. He said a woman had rung the BBC to say there was a hurricane on the way and he told viewers: ‘Don’t worry, there isn’t!’ Frosty: Giles claims in his new book that his colleagues Michael Fish, left and John Kettley, right, plotted to overthrow him . And Giles, 73, has rubbed salt into his rival’s wounds by writing: ‘I understand it was to be put in the Guinness Book of Records as the worst forecast in the history of universe and if it wasn’t it should have been.’ He reportedly attacked Ian McCaskill - a . popular character famed for his eccentric and jovial manner - for once . dismissing him as being like ‘a prefect at a minor public school.’ The book entitled ‘You Have Wives?’ is being co-written by John Teather, former editor at the BBC Weather Centre.

When choosing who would act as chief supporter on his wedding day, this groom-to-be wanted the best of the best. Demanding Duncan Twigg had his younger brother and three closest friends compete for the honour of being his best man in a series of wacky challenges - ranging from a dance-off to a hot dog eating contest. After two years and 12 contests, Mr Twigg, 31, from Attenborough, Nottinghamshire, eventually chose his brother Chris Twigg to stand beside him when he weds his fiancee Rosanna Lethbridge in Devon this weekend. Scroll down for video . Coveted role: The groom-to-be's brother Chris Twigg and friends Luke Redel, James Bradwell, and Dan Shaw (l-r) competed for two years to be Duncan Twigg's (being lifted) best man . Chris, 29, today said there was 'no way' he was going to lose to one of his brother's close friends; Luke Redel, 30, James Bradwell, 31, and Dan Shaw. The rivals had gone to extreme lengths to prove themselves worthy of being named best man, competing in a speech contest, a pub treasure hunt and a Come Dine With Me-style challenge in a bid to impress the groom-to-be. Mr Twigg, who proposed to his girlfriend Rosanna at the Grand Canyon in May 2011, likened his friends' antics to having '12 stag dos'. 'There's been a lot of fun and games,' he said. 'It's been a great excuse for the guys to get together. We even had a bit of a following along the way as about ten to 15 people came along to each challenge to watch. 'Every single one was a great social event - it's been an absolute blast.' Mr Twigg added that his wife-to-be had been 'very patient and supportive' throughout, despite having a wedding to organise. Determined: The candidates performed a series of wacky challenges, taking part in everything from a traditional school sports day (pictured) to a hot dog eating contest . Hot dog eating contest: Duncan, whose brother and closest friends went to extreme lengths in a bid to chosen as his best man, said it had been 'an absolute blast' The challenges kicked off in August 2011 when the four men, all from Nottingham, competed in a pub treasure hunt. This was followed by a test to see which of the boys could make the most money from a starting sum of £10 within eight hours. After that came a traditional school sports day, which saw the four men pitted against one another in an egg and spoon race, a three-legged race and a sack race. Challenges: In total the would-be best men performed 12 tasks,  including a Come Dine With Me-style contest (left) and a board game challenge (right) Still not satisfied, Mr Twigg went on . to challenge his friends to compete in the Come Dine With Me contest, a . pub quiz and a pub games tournament featuring darts, pool and dominoes. 1.

The boys then took their respective . campaigns for the role online in a YouTube challenge to see who could . get the most hits. They were then tasked with inventing a board game, a . round of pub Cluedo, a best man speech contest, before rounding it all . off with a hot dog eating competition. Mr Twigg said: 'Chris was out in front from about the halfway point. 'I'm really pleased he won.' 'Everyone I've spoken to about the challenges said I should've just chosen him anyway. 'But this makes it sweeter,' Mr Twigg said. 'He put in the most effort of the four to win - and he is my brother after all.' The groom-to-be said his favourite event was the dance contest, which was judged by their local MP Anna Soubry. His brother won five of the 12 challenges - but only managed second place in the speech writing contest. 'He'll be even better come the real thing, and I'll probably get a lot more stick,' Mr Twigg said. His brother and best man-to-be said: 'There was no way I was going to lose because I should have been picked originally. 'But knowing Duncan as I do I had to humour the contest and try that little bit harder to make sure that I won. I was determined to win it because he is my brother and it was something I really wanted to do. 'We've grown up together and it's going to be such an honour to be by his side when he gets married,' Mr Twigg said. Support: A YouTube challenge saw Duncan's brother (pictured) and friends making their case for the role online . Tying the knot: Duncan Twigg proposed to his fiancee Rosanna Lethbridge at the Grand Canyon in the U.S. The boys took revenge on Mr Twigg at his stag party - which his brother was finally able to organise last month - setting him challenges of his own during a weekend trip to Liverpool. 'They bought me a four foot-long Subway sandwich and ordered me to eat it,' Mr Twigg said. 'I only got about a third of the way through before I was full. 'I definitely preferred being the one who set the challenges,' he added. Come Dine With Me: Mr Twigg's brother and friends each whipped up a feast for this challenge . Back to school: The boys went up against one another in a three-legged race (pictured), a sack race and an egg and spoon race in a 'school sports day' challenge . Dance-off: The candidates efforts on the dance floor were judged by their local MP Anna Soubry . Entrepreneur challenge: Chris Twigg, seen left trying to turn a profit from a starting sum of £10, was eventually named the winner . Head-scratcher: The candidates were tasked with designing a board game over two years' worth of challenges . Crucial choice: The would-be best men were all asked to write and deliver a best man's speech for Mr Twigg . The impressive efforts of the three . disappointed candidates will not go unrewarded at the weekend, as they . will all be ushers in the wedding party. The . contest was inspired by the film 12 Rounds - starring John Cena and . Ashley Scott - in which a detective is set a dozen challenges to free . his kidnapped girlfriend. Getting wed: Duncan Twigg's friends took revenge at his long-awaited stag do, challenging him to eat a four foot long Subway sandwich . Bride-to-be Rosanna, an accountant, said she always believed Chris was the right man for the job. 'I've had to be pretty patient and understanding about it all as we've had quite a lot to do with organising the wedding,' she said. 'But I understand why Duncan had to do it because it was a hard decision for him. 'Personally I thought Chris all along and he really did put in more effort than the others in the end.

It's a subject many women are reluctant to discuss, but hair thinning and balding can be as much a problem for them as for men. Now a range of products has been launched to repair the effects of hair loss and nourish the tresses of those who wish to get their healthy look back. The three-treatment Hairgen range – which includes a shampoo, a spray and a supplement – works by limiting the effect of dihydrotesterone, the hormone responsible for hair loss which is found in hair follicles. Sell out: The three-treatment Hairgen range has been an instant success online . Hair thinning can start when a woman reaches her 20s. Factors such as stress, pregnancy, menopause, ageing and even excessive use of straighteners can all contribute to the condition. Demand for the Hairgen range, which costs £69.99, has been high, with a 6,000-strong waiting list on the Boots website. After its launch in June the treatment initially sold out within three days. The products contain extracts of an American plant – saw palmetto – as well as amino acids and biotin, a vitamin which encourages growth. The drug-free range includes a shampoo, a spray and a supplement to combat thinning of hair without any of the side effects which are associated with other treatments. The products contain extracts of the American plant Saw Palmetto, as well as Aminoacids and Biotin, a B-complex vitamin which encourages growth. Anna Britton, Managing Director of Concept Healthcare, the company behind Hairgen, said: ‘Our three-step system contains topical treatments and nourishing capsules that have been developed to slow down the production of the major hormone Dihydrotestosterone  associated with hair loss, effectively protecting and stimulating the follicles and keeping them in optimum health. Widespread problem: Factors such as stress, pregnancy and ageing can all contribute to baldness . ‘It’s usually men we associate with baldness and thinning but a huge number of women are affected and it can have a big psychological impact.  To suddenly start losing your hair can be devastating to a woman’s self-esteem.’ Hairgen, which has been dermatologically tested, has proved popular with those who have used the treatment. Sarah Lewis, 52, from Somerset said: ‘I have been menopausal for the last two years and some of the symptoms alongside hot flushes, included thinning hair which I’ve found distressing and embarrassing. ‘I have been using the Hairgen system for just under a month as part of a trial and already my hair is thicker, stronger and it’s certainly stopped the hair loss. ‘I would recommend it to anyone including friends who haven’t got symptoms as it really leaves the hair feeling and looking healthy.’ Ben Marks, 44, from London said: ‘Have been trialling Hairgen for just three weeks and it’s stopped my hair thinning and my girlfriend thinks it looks thicker. ‘It’s a major relief as I thought I’d end up shaving my hair off.’","The Hairgen range has a 6,000-strong waiting list on the Boots website .

A leading happiness researcher has claimed that playful dolphins parents are a better model for parents than take-no-prisoners tigers. Shawn Archor. who teaches at Wharton School of Business, believes that the dolphin's combination of sociability . and playfulness makes kids smarter and happier than criticism, the New York Daily News reports. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom author Amy Chan famously advocated no . TV and no tolerance for grades below 'A' in her 2011 bestseller. Dolphin dad: Happiness lecturer Shawn Archor believes that encouragement is more crucial to a child's success than criticism (posed by models) But Mr Archor believes that building a positive mental state is the real key to a child's success. 'Most companies and schools follow this formula: if you work harder, you . will be more successful, and then you will be happy,' he writes. 'This formula is . scientifically backward.' Instead, he believes that parents should focus on first building positive psychology for their kids so that success will follow. Celebrity parents: Dolphin dads like Hugh Jackman (left) and Brad Pitt (right) seem adopt a relaxed and playful approach rather than rigid rules when out and about with their kids . His research has been validated by a . study in the Asian American Journal of Psychology, which showed that a . tiger parenting profile was associated with lower GPA and less of a sense of family obligation that children who had supportive parents. Happiness researcher: Mr Archor claims that parents should mimic the playful dolphin . Another study shows that tiger kids also face more academic pressure, more depressive symptoms, and a greater . sense of alienation. Mr Archor believes in making learning fun. So rather than waiting to reward a kid for finishing his homework, for example, he recommends letting him wear his favorite . pajamas while he studies. He also suggests modeling optimism to . children by aiming for a ratio of five positive interactions to every . negative one. Mr Archor says that being positive isn't about being delusional. He suggests using 'rational optimism' to examine multiple options and navigate among them to pick the best. When facing challenges, he says that reminding them of past achievements - such as giving them a trophy before a competition -  can help them stay positive and focused. And instead of being overly harsh, he recommends setting kids up for success. So, he says, a parent who wants her child to exercise more should hide the remote and put  her in sneakers so she's ready . to get moving. He believes that parents should consciously working at being happier. 'While it takes more cognitive processing to be happier, the more that . you do these positive habits, the more that you switch your default,' he says.","Harvard-educated researcher Shawn Archor is one of the world's leading experts on the connection between happiness and success .

Democratic Unionist Party MP Nigel Dodds was believed to be knocked unconscious and was hospitalised after trouble broke out in the north of the city. Rioting loyalists, at least one wielding a ceremonial sword, attacked police in a major outbreak of violence in the area. Scroll down for video .

Riot gear: A loyalist youth leaps from one police van to another as policemen look on in Belfast . Police were pelted with rocks, golf balls and bottles taken from recycling bins and fireworks were also thrown at police. Around 23 officers were injured, police confirmed. Baton rounds were fired and water cannon used by officers to disperse rioters. Rioting also broke out in East Belfast. Mr Dodds had earlier been allowed behind police lines to talk to senior officers in a bid to try and calm the situation. A DUP spokesman said of Mr Dodds MP's injuries: 'It appears he was in and around the police lines and was talking to the police. 'He was hit by a brick or piece of masonry and he is presently at or on his way to Accident and Emergency.' The Orange Order had also taken to Twitter to appeal for calm last night. A Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spokesman confirmed Mr Dodds had been injured and added that four officers in the area were hurt, three knocked unconscious, and were receiving treatment for their injuries. The force used water cannon and has fired around 20 baton rounds. One man was arrested for disorderly behaviour and another for provocative behaviour. Eyewitnesses blamed loyalists for the missile throwing. Sticks, fireworks, drain pipes, and part of a wall were hurled at police. Rioters as young as 14 were said to have been involved.

In East Belfast, police confirmed they came under attack with a sword and missiles and water cannons were also deployed there. Two arrests were made. One of the injured police officers in North Belfast is being treated for head and leg injuries, police said. At least two press photographers were also hurt. A PSNI spokesman said: 'There is an element within these crowds that is intent on violence. 'Public safety is of paramount concern and individuals if they are gathering to watch events are advised to disperse.' The violence was triggered by the banning of an Orange Order parade completing its normal route past the Catholic Ardoyne district. The march had been allowed down the Crumlin Road in the mornign but the Orangemen were ordered by the Parades Commission to return via another route. Violent skirmishes broke out before Orangemen attempted to force their way back to the Crumlin Road. Keep back: A line of riot vans separates Loyalists from police . Forlorn: One protestor holds his head in his hands as he looks on as riot police spray water canons at Loyalists . It followed a day of peaceful July 12 holiday loyal order parades across Northern Ireland, the pinnacle of loyalists' marching season. DUP leader and Stormont First Minister Peter Robinson called for calm in Belfast. He said: 'Violence and attacks on the PSNI and the wider community are wrong, can never be justified and must stop. 'While there is justifiable anger and frustration at the Parades Commission, who bear much responsibility for the situation in Belfast as do those who attacked parades as they passed certain locations, nonetheless, those who are using the cover of protest to attack the police are massively damaging the cause they support. 'Violence is undermining a just cause and runs totally against the wishes of the Orange Order for protest to be entirely peaceful.

'My thoughts are with those who have been injured this evening, including my colleague Nigel Dodds MP and other Orange Order members, police officers and civilians. I appeal for cool heads to prevail at this time.' Ulster Unionist Stormont MLA Michael Copeland said the situation in East Belfast was extremely dangerous. Bricks and bottles have been thrown by both sides and he claimed marchers came under a barrage of bottles as they walked home from a Twelfth demonstration. He said: 'In my opinion this situation was entirely avoidable. Stricken: An injured policemen lies hurt on the ground and is dragged away by colleagues . Hurt: Colleagues gather round an injured colleague in Belfast last night . 'The Parades Commission has rewarded bad behaviour last year and has pushed a community which is very, very angry and is not prepared to be pushed.' Shortly before he was hurt, Mr Dodds said: 'I would appeal for everybody to stay calm, not to get involved in violence. 'The Grand Lodge have made it clear they do not want violence and the people who want to engage in violence should desist immediately.' Loyalist bandsmen played sectarian tunes at police lines while bricks and bottles were thrown. At one point a rioter broke down a section of wall and threw it at police shields. Others used sticks and pieces of drainpipe to batter police vehicles while some danced on top of the force's Land Rovers and tried to rip off protective plating. Take aim: Police with rubber-bullet guns take position during clashes with protesters . Stand off: Policemen stand guard during a march in north Belfast yesterday . Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly blamed the violence on the Orange Order and unionist politicians. He said: 'Speech after speech at the various (Orange) demonstrations were clearly designed to stir up sectarian tension and have alongside the Orange Order's failure to abide by Parades Commission determinations led directly to the violence in Belfast tonight. 'No amount of hand wringing or denial in the coming days from the Orange Order and unionist politicians can alter that reality. 'People had a right to expect better, instead what we got was a very deliberate strategy with the inevitable results being seen on the streets this evening.' The Orange Order has appealed for calm and asked that all parades be peaceful. Loyalists watch a bonfire in the Sandy Row area of Belfast on Thursday night .

Mr Dodds was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in West Belfast where a hospital spokeswoman said his condition was stable. He is deputy leader of the DUP. The former lawyer has been North Belfast MP since 2001 but was suspended from the House of Commons chamber last week after the Parades Commission said it would ban the parade in Ardoyne.

A mother raising her four children in a ninth-floor council flat has won a move after successfully arguing they could fall to their deaths. Fartuuna Warsame waged a three-year battle with Birmingham City Council, which has now agreed to move her family on safety grounds. The local authority hope that, by giving way before a court appeal was heard, it would avoid setting a legal precedent which would open the floodgates for demands for moves from high-rise flats. New home: Mother Fartuuna Warsame won a battle against Birmingham City Council to get moved from a tower block as it was dangerous to live there . Mrs Warsame has lived in the flat in Thames Tower, Nechells, Birmingham, for seven years. She said: 'This is such a relief. The ninth floor is no place to bring up young children. 'They can easily get the windows open. I dare not even go into another room. I told the council it would be responsible if a child fell.' The single mother claimed she was stopped from fitting her own window locks in case of fire. Her children are Aisha, eight, Rukaya, five, Aaliyah, two, and her baby Ridwan. Last month a girl of two fell to her death from a third-floor flat in a Bristol tower block. Danger: Mrs Warsame argued that it was unsafe to live with four children in a ninth-floor flat in this Birmingham block . Mrs Warsame's solicitor Mike Milvaney, of Community Law Partnership, said at times she had to leave her children alone in the flat as she struggled up the stairs with her baby and shopping. He said: 'Councils must think carefully about continuing to leave or place young families with children in tower blocks. 'It is no answer to say that budget constraints and limited resources are to blame when young lives are at risk. 'The council has a moral and legal duty to consider the reasonableness of the accommodation provided.' Battle: Mrs Warsame said: 'I dare not even go into another room. I told the council it would be responsible if a child fell' A council spokesman said the decision was not binding on others. He added: 'Due to the large number of flats in the city, a number of families live in similar properties, in line with the council's housing allocations policy. 'Though the family were given the right to be moved in this case, no admissions were made as to the merits of the appeal and the appeal was dismissed.'","Fartuuna Warsame fought for three years to leave Birmingham tower block .

A teacher who oversaw an art history lesson during which pupils cut themselves with blades has resigned from a £7,500 a year 'alternative' private school. The part-time teacher was suspended after pupils at Ringwood Waldorf School in Hampshire sliced themselves as part of the lesson, and later resigned from her post as school chiefs were investigating the incident. The fee-paying school, which follows the Rudolf Steiner model of education and aims to 'bring joy into the learning process', confirmed the teacher concerned had resigned ahead of a disciplinary hearing. Incident: The part-time teacher has resigned after pupils cut themselves during her art history lesson at Ringwood Waldorf School in Hampshire . Ringwood, which caters to pupils aged from three to 18, said the member of staff had acted without the knowledge of superiors. 'We can confirm an incident took place during an art history lesson on March 19 during which a part-time teacher, subsequently suspended pending a full investigation, acted independently without our knowledge,' school administrator Nigel Revill said. 'The teacher concerned resigned during the disciplinary process, before a disciplinary hearing could take place. 'The teacher is no longer employed by the school and we have no plans to reinstate her,' Mr Revill added. Ringwood has stressed the incident was an isolated one and said it is no longer under investigation. Alternative: Ringwood is one of more than 900 Steiner Waldorf schools worldwide (file photo) The teacher was reported to the School Inspection Service, which oversees independent schools, and to Dorset County Council's safeguarding team, Mr Revill said. He added that the school had been advised by both organisations it had taken the correct steps in informing them of the incident at the earliest opportunity. Fees for the school on the border of Hampshire and Dorset range from £3,610 to £7,500 per year. Ringwood is one of more than 900 Steiner Waldorf schools worldwide. The approach is based upon the principles of Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian philosopher and social reformer who identified three broad stages in child development - each around seven years long. In the early years Waldorf education focuses on providing practical and hands-on activities to encourage creative play, before moving on to developing pupils' artistic expression and social capacities. Developing critical understanding and fostering idealism is at the heart of secondary education at Waldorf Steiner schools. On its website Ringwood describes the curriculum as 'uniquely designed to meet the developing emotional and intellectual needs of children'. 'It works through the values of goodness, beauty and truth, encouraging children to seek these within themselves and in the world around, creating a warm and encouraging environment in which children can grow and learn,' it reads. The name Waldorf stems from Steiner's first school established in Stuttgart in 1919, which was for the children of employees at the Waldorf Astoria factory.","Part-time teacher suspended at Ringwood Waldorf School in Hampshire .

Four Russian nationals and a Ukrainian have been charged with running a sophisticated hacking organization that penetrated computer networks of more than a dozen major American and international corporations over seven years, stealing and selling at least 160 million credit and debit card numbers, resulting in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. Indictments were announced Thursday in Newark, where U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman called the case the largest hacking and data breach scheme ever prosecuted in the United States. Princeton-based Heartland Payment Systems Inc., which processes credit and debit cards for small to mid-sized businesses, was identified as taking the biggest hit in a scheme starting in 2007 — the theft of more than 130 million card numbers at a loss of about $200 million. Scroll down for video . Dmitriy Smilianets, left, is in U.S. custody and expected to appear in federal court next week, while Albert Gonzalez, right, is currently serving 20 years for stealing credit card numbers . Atlanta-based Global Payment Systems, another major payment processing company, had nearly one million card numbers stolen, with losses of nearly $93 million, prosecutors said. The indictment did not put a loss figure on the thefts at some other major corporations, including Commidea Ltd., a European provider of electronic payment processing for retailers. The government said hackers in 2008 covertly removed about 30 million card numbers from its computer network. About 800,000 card numbers were stolen in an attack on the Visa network, but the indictment did not cite any loss figure. Not all the companies the hackers infected over the years with malicious computer software suffered financial losses. Customer log-in credentials were stolen from Nasdaq and Dow Jones Inc., the indictment said, though prosecutors said Nasdaq's trading platform was not affected. The indictment said the suspects sent each other instant messages as they took control of the corporate data, telling each other, for instance: 'NASDAQ is owned.' At least one man told others that he used Google news alerts to learn whether his hacks had been discovered, according to the court filing. The defendants were identified as Vladimir Drinkman, 32, of Syktyvkar, Russia (PDF), and Moscow; Aleksander Kalinin, 26, of St. Petersburg, Russia (PDF); Roman Kotov, 32, of Moscow; Dmitriy Smilianets, 29, of Moscow; and Mikhail Rytikov, 26, of Odessa, Ukraine. Smilianets is in U.S. custody and was expected to appear in federal court next week. His New York-based lawyer, Bruce Provda, said Smilianets was in the U.S. ‘sightseeing’ when he was arrested. ‘It's a rather complex international charge of hacking,’ Provda said. ‘If it goes to trial, it's going to be a lengthy trial.’ Drinkman is being held in the Netherlands pending extradition, prosecutors said. His lawyer there, Bart Stapert, did not immediately return a message. The other three defendants remained at large. Princeton-based Heartland Payment Systems was identified as taking the biggest hit ¿ the theft of more than 130 million card numbers at a loss of about $200 million . The prosecution builds on the 2009 case that resulted in a 20-year prison sentence for Albert Gonzalez of Miami, who often used the screen name 'soupnazi' and is identified in the new complaint as an unindicted co-conspirator. Other unindicted co-conspirators were also named. In the Gonzalez case, which focused on the theft from Heartland - at the time the biggest breach of its kind ever discovered in the U.S. - Kalinin and Drinkman were charged as 'Hacker 1' and 'Hacker 2.' Prosecutors identified the two as sophisticated hackers who specialized in penetrating the computer networks of multinational corporations, financial institutions and payment processors. Kotov's specialty was harvesting data from the networks after they had been penetrated, and Rytikov provided anonymous web-hosting services that were used to hack into computer networks and covertly remove data, the indictment said. Smilianets was the information salesman, the government said. All five are charged with taking part in a computer hacking conspiracy and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The four Russian nationals are also charged with multiple counts of unauthorized computer access and wire fraud. The individuals who purchased the credit and debit card numbers and associated data from the hacking organization resold them through online forums or directly to others known as 'cashers,' the indictment said. Atlanta-based Global Payment Systems had nearly one million card numbers stolen, with losses of nearly $93 million . According to the indictment, U.S. credit card numbers sold for about $10 each; Canadian numbers were $15 and better-encrypted European ones $50. The data was stored on computer servers all over the world, including in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Latvia, the Netherlands, Bahamas, Ukraine, Panama and Germany. The cashers would encode the information onto the magnetic strips of blank plastic cards and cash out the value, by either withdrawing money from ATMs in the case of debit cards, or running up charges and purchasing goods in the case of credit cards. The charging documents unsealed Thursday show instant message chats between Gonzalez and Kalinin about hacking into Hannaford's systems. When Kalinin jokes about the breach being reported on TV news, Gonzalez advises him to set up Google news alerts, like Gonzalez says he has, for 'data breach' 'credit card fraud' 'debit card fraud' 'atm fraud' and 'hackers.' The gang stole about 800,000 card numbers in an attack on the Visa network . 'It's how I find out when my hacks are found,' Gonzalez says. Gonzalez jokes, 'Hannaford will spend millions to upgrade their security!! Lol' And Kalinin replies: 'they would better pay us to not hack them again.' Kalinin was also charged, along with another Russian man, in a separate indictment unsealed in New York on Thursday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Ap . PUBLISHED: . 21:07 EST, 30 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:08 EST, 30 July 2013 . The ongoing spat over national security spending between Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reached a fever pitch on Tuesday, with Paul referring to the plus-sized Christie as 'the king of bacon.' 'This is the king of bacon talking about bacon,' Paul told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Both are considered potential 2016 contenders for the Republican presidential nomination. Paul's remark was in response to Christie's comments earlier in the day that Paul brings millions in 'pork' spending back to his home state of Kentucky. How Rude! Senator Rand Paul called Chris Christie - the plus-sized governor of New Jersey - 'the king of bacon' 'So if Senator Paul wants to start looking at where he's going to cut . spending to afford defense, maybe he should start cutting the pork . barrel spending that he brings home to Kentucky,' Christie told reporters . Christie last week criticized Paul’s opposition to warrantless federal surveillance programs, saying it harmed efforts to prevent terrorism. Paul told reporters after speaking at a fundraiser outside Nashville on Sunday that Christie’s position hurts GOP chances in national elections, and that spending priorities of critics like the governor and Rep. Peter King of New York do more to harm national security. 'They’re precisely the same people who are unwilling to cut the spending, and their ""Gimme, gimme, gimme — give me all my Sandy money now.’” Paul said, referring to federal funding after the hurricane last year. 'Those are the people who are bankrupting the government and not letting enough money be left over for national defense.' The king: Christie has been struggling with his weight for years and recently underwent gastric band surgery . King in a phone interview late Sunday called Paul’s criticism of Sandy aid 'indefensible.' 'This was absolutely life or death money that was essential to New York and New Jersey,' King said. Christie, at a forum in Colorado on Thursday, pointed to a 'strain of libertarianism' coursing through both parties as a 'very dangerous thought' more than a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. Christie was asked whether he was referring to Paul, a fellow potential Republican presidential candidate who has been at the forefront of the party’s libertarian wing. 'You can name any number of people and he’s one of them,' said Christie. 'These esoteric, intellectual debates — I want them to come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation. And they won’t, because that’s a much tougher conversation to have.' War of words: Christie and Paul have been feuding for weeks about Paul's libertarian leanings . Paul on Sunday rejected arguments that the National Security Agency’s collection of hundreds of millions of U.S. phone and Internet records is necessary to prevent terrorism. 'I don’t mind spying on terrorists,' he said. 'I just don’t like spying on all Americans.' Paul said the issue resonates particularly with young people, a key demographic Republicans need to attract in order to succeed in national elections. 'If you talk about some privacy issues like that, I think you will find youth coming to you,' said Paul, who said his own decision on whether to run for president won’t come until next year. King called that argument misguided. 2016: Both Christie and Paul are considered to be potential presidential candidates for the 2016 election . 'When it comes to national defense, we shouldn’t be pandering to any demographic,' he said. 'We need to do what’s best for the country.' Messages left with Christie’s office late Sunday were not immediately returned. As for the back and forth with Christie, Paul said he wasn’t the one itching for a fight. 'I didn’t start this one, and I don’t plan on starting things by criticizing other Republicans,' he said. 'But if they want to make me the target, they will get it back in spades.'","Both men are considered to be potential presidential candidates in the 2016 election .

The Bank of England’s new governor Mark Carney is expected to confirm that interest rates will remain at historic lows, in a radical break from tradition. The Canadian is expected to make the unprecedented commitment - a bonus for borrowers but condemned as a disaster for savers - on Wednesday when he presents his first monthly inflation report since taking over from Lord King last month. The new policy, dubbed ‘forward guidance’, was used by Carney in his previous job as governor of the Bank of Canada. But it has never been used before for interest rates in the British central bank’s 300 year history.The aim will be to reassure investors, businesses and households across Britain that interest rates will be frozen for some time to come. It comes amid growing fears that a sudden rise in interest rates could tip many households and businesses around the country over the edge. The Bank estimates that if rates were to rise from 0.5pc to just 2.5pc and incomes remained “subdued”, households with about £240 billion of mortgage debt would “experience financial difficulties”. Interest rates were slashed to a record low of 0.5pc in March 2009 in a bid to provide breathing space for borrowers grappling with the most severe financial crisis in living memory. Last month the Bank signalled its intention, stating that expectations that interest rates would rise from their current level in the next two years were ‘not warranted’. This marked an attempt to put some distance between developments in the US and Britain. Last month the Bank signalled its intention, stating that expectations that interest rates would rise from their current level in the next two years were 'not warranted' The Federal Reserve has indicated that its support for the US economy through quantitative easing may be coming to an end – pushing up interest rates on the financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Chancellor George Osborne ordered the Bank to report back on introducing forward guidance as a new weapon in its armoury to steer the economy back to full health. Experts last night described the new policy as great for borrowers but an ‘unmitigated disaster’ for savers. Chancellor George Osborne ordered the Bank to report back on introducing forward guidance as a new weapon in its armoury to steer the economy back to full health . David Buik, a veteran City commentator from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘The Bank wants to make sure that any rates movement are not a surprise to businesses and customers. It wants them to be put on notice– so they can take care of their financial affairs.’ But he added: ‘It’s a very  good thing for borrowers , but for savers it’s an unmitigated disaster.’ A combination of rate cuts on savings accounts and high inflation has cost savers more than £220 billion, according to campaign group Save Our Savers. Its spokesman Simon Rose said: ‘Low interest rates have not boosted the economy in the last four years. Extending this further takes money away from savers and the economy - but does not promote growth.’ It is not known how the Bank will apply this new policy. It could opt to commit to freeze interest rates unless unemployment falls below a certain level. Other options include tying the commitment to average wages or growth. The Bank is expected to slighty increase its GDP growth forecast and its say that inflation will be lower than previously anticipated. This follows a slew of data which indicates the economy is picking up speed, with manufacturers boasting a strong rebound in July - with the strongest growth since March 2011. Growth - as measured by GDP -  doubled to 0.6pc in the three months to the end of June, from the first quarter. But the economy is still 3.3pc smaller than it was before the recession struck.  It is also lagging behind all the other members of the G7, except Italy.","The Canadian is expected to make the commitment on Wednesday .

The wife and daughter of a man who were found guilty of his murder and dubbed the 'lady killers' have had their convictions quashed by the Court of Appeal. Shirley and Lynette Banfield argued there was no evidence retired bookmaker, Don Banfield, who was last seen in 2001, was even dead and that he could be among the 2,000 people-a-year who disappear. Three of the country’s top judges today agreed with their lawyers that - with no body, no suggested mechanism of death and no indication even of the date when Mr Banfield was allegedly killed - his wife and daughter simply had ‘no case to answer’. Lynette Banfield (left) and her mother Shirley (right) argued there was no evidence the bookmaker was dead . The jury’s murder verdict was quashed and the women will not face a retrial. Shirley, 65, was last year found guilty by a jury at London’s Old Bailey of enlisting her 42-year-old daughter’s help to kill with Mr Banfield, 63, and profit from his death. Mr Banfield, from Wealdstone, in north-west London, who was reputed to be a heavy gambler and womaniser, had recently retired when he disappeared. After completing the contract for the sale of his home for £179,000 in May 2001, he was never seen again. Crown lawyers argued the mother and daughter had a financial motive and acted 'in concert' to dispose of Mr Banfield. Never found: Don Banfield disappeared more than a decade ago . The jury found both women, who lived together in Thanington, near Canterbury, guilty of murder by a 10-1 majority in April last year. The pair, who had earlier admitted fraud offences in relation to the plundering of Mr Banfield’s £64,000 pension fund, were each jailed for life. However William Clegg QC, for Shirley Banfield, told London’s Criminal Appeal Court it had not even been proved that Mr Banfield was dead. He said: 'The evidence proved that Don Banfield disppeared over the week-end 12/13th May 2001. 'The Crown did not suggest when, where or how he was killed, who was present, the mechanism of death or what happened to the body.' He added: 'Two hundred thousand people disappear each year and 2,000 of those are not heard from again. Don Banfield could have been one of those 2,000.' Overturning the women’s murder convictions, Lady Justice Rafferty said: 'This was an alleged joint enterprise murder with no body, no suggested mechanism of death, no identified day when the murder was said to have occurred, no time and no place and no suggestion of what happened to the body.' Lynette and Shirley Banfield arriving for their murder trial at the Old Bailey last year . Although Mr Clegg had accepted that the likelihood was that 'one or other' of the women killed Mr Banfield, the judge said there was simply no evidence on which any rational jury could conclude that they had acted together to kill him. Crown lawyers argued the woman had both the opportunity and motive for murder, but the judge emphasised: 'Suspicion without more does not equate to proof'. One woman might have had trouble killing Mr Banfield single-handed and disposing of his body. But the judge, sitting with Mr Justice Simon and Mrs Justice Carr, said: 'The courts regularly see proved allegations of homicide against a woman acting alone'. The judge ruled: 'The submission of no case to answer should have been allowed. These appeals will be allowed and both convictions will be quashed'. She added: 'For the most evident of reasons there could be no question of a retrial'.","Shirley and Lynette Banfield were found guilty of murdering retired bookmaker Don Banfield .

But her lavish lifestyle turned out to be built on a pyramid scheme in which she defrauded investors of £7.5million. She has now been jailed for six years. Prison: 'Greed driven' Kankamol Albon, 41, (pictured) has now been jailed after she admitted her luxury car dealership was . nothing more than a front for a fraud operation which raked in millions . of pounds .

He told Albon: ‘You persistently defrauded investors who were told that you were able to buy and sell high-value motor vehicles, such as Bugattis, Ferraris, Rolls-Royces and Maseratis, which you claimed could be immediately sold for profit and would be available for the personal use of investors. The majority of investors never saw a car.

A dog lover was involved in a dramatic rescue of four puppies in a bid to save them from suffocation when a homeless man put them in a Tupperware box. In a desperate attempt to slow down a bus carrying the man and retrieve the pets, Annie Hart enlisted a friend to drive in front of the vehicle and restrict its speed until she could reach it herself. When she got there, she persuaded the driver to open the doors for her and bribed the homeless man to hand over the puppies. Scroll down for video . Saved! These four puppies were rescued from inside a sealed Tupperware container . Playful: Raven and Elliott rumble around together after being bought from a homeless man . The tiny dogs have been nursed back to health and will soon be put up for adoption, allowing them to receive the nurture they never had before their rescue. Ms Hart, who runs an animal rescue charity called the Bill Foundation, recounted the story of the dramatic car chase through Los Angeles a few weeks ago at Dogster. She received a call late at night from her friend Samantha Haas, another animal charity activist, saying she had seen a homeless man with a sealed Tupperware box containing four puppies. Ms Haas had tried to persuade the man to hand over the dogs for their own safety, but he refused and boarded a bus. Desperate: The hunt to save Logan and the three other dogs involved a late-night Los Angeles car chase . Lucky: The man originally refused to hand over Luke, pictured, the smallest of the four dogs . Scamp: Elliott gets cosy with a shoe, unaware of the danger he faced before being rescued by Annie Hart . Ms Hart told her to pull in front of the bus and drive slowly, to allow her and her husband to arrive on the scene and stage an intervention to save the animals. Although the bus driver started honking his horn in irritation, the plan seemed to be broadly working, and the Harts were able to catch up - accompanied by their own pet dog Arnold. When the bus stopped to let passengers off, Ms Hart wrote, 'James hits the gas and slides up behind the bus, I hop out and dash for its open door. It closes. 'Like a lunatic I am jumping up and down, calling for the driver to open the doors. Like a completely sane person, he drives away.' The bus stopped again a few minutes later and this time Ms Hart persuaded the driver to let her on by explaining her mission. Watch a live stream of the dogs in their new home .

Origin: The survival of Raven and the others is down to the dedication of Ms Hart . Playpen: The dogs were adopted into a loving and nurturing environment at the Harts' home . She located the young homeless man, and saw that he was pushing a cart with a Tupperware container which had four puppies inside. After striking up a conversation with him, she explained her job and asked if he wanted to get off the bus so they could work out 'how to help his puppies'. During a one-on-one conversation monitored from a few yards away by her husband, Ms Hart convinced the man to hand over three of the animals by giving him cash. However, he insisted he had promised the smallest one to a friend, and could not give it up. When the group had ensured the safety of the three puppies, Mr Hart headed into the night to find the homeless man and retrieve the final dog. Escape! Elliott strains to get away during a visit to the vet to ensure he is staying healthy . Placid: Raven seems to be a lot more chilled out when he takes his turn on the examination table . He told him: 'You aren't sure your friend is going to take this puppy. Tell you what - you give your friend some of the money I'm paying you, then he can pay the fee to rescue another dog from the shelter. Two dogs get saved.' Happily, the gambit worked, and the Harts were able to take all four animals home. Due to the 'comic book' nature of the bizarre rescue, the couple named the dogs after characters from X-Men - Luke, Elliott, Raven and Logan. Ms Hart told the Huffington Post: 'Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I'd be involved in a high-speed chase down Santa Monica Boulevard at midnight, my husband behind the wheel while I direct my friends - via cell phone - to stop a bus by creating a road block with their car. 'But when I heard there were four lives in danger something instinctually kicked in, and nothing was going to stop me from trying to save these pups.' The dogs, which seem to be around 10 weeks old, will be put up for adoption in two weeks' time.","Annie Hart received call from a friend warning that a homeless man was carrying round a Tupperware container with four puppies in .

A study out this summer from Ohio State University says smokers cost their employers around $6,000 per year more than non-smokers. Researchers led by Micah Berman, who will become an assistant professor at the university’s College of Public Health this month, used the findings of previous studies to take a comprehensive look at the financial burden smokers put on their employers. Coming as no surprise, smoke breaks cost employers the lion’s share of the six grand, followed by higher healthcare costs, absenteeism, and lower productivity. Cost defective: An Ohio State University researcher has concluded that smokers cost their employers an average of $6,000 per year . ‘This research should help businesses make better informed decisions about their tobacco policies,’ Berman said. ‘We constructed our calculations such that individual employers can plug in their own expenses to get more accurate estimates of their own costs.’ The study came up with some precise numbers for how much absenteeism, lost productivity, smoke breaks and health care cost employers each year. On average, smoke breaks cost employers $3,077 per year, while the second highest expenditure, health care, costs employers an average of $2,056 per year. And while absenteeism caused by ill health made up around $500 of the costs, ‘presenteeism’—or reduced productivity—accounted for $462 of the researchers’ calculations. Breakdown: The study, led by researcher Micah Berman, came to some very specific dollar amounts about how smokers cost their employers money . But not them all: By dying, some retired smokers could could save their employers money by offsetting the pension costs of longer-lived non-smokers . All told, the annual costs could range from $2,885 to $10,125 per smoker, according to the study. Some smokers, however, can actually save their employers money the study also found. Though they have to be dead. When a retiree who receives a set amount of pension each year from his or her former employer dies, that employer saves around $296. This happens because of the difference in lifespan between smokers and non-smokers because the shorter-lived smokers actually help offset pensions of the longer-lived non-smokers. Meanwhile, Berman urged employers not to start fuming right away. ‘Employers should be understanding about how difficult it is to quit smoking and how much support is needed,’ he said. ‘It’s definitely not just a cost issue, but employers should be informed about what the costs are when they are considering these policies.’","An Ohio State University researcher compiled data from other studies to determine exact costs to employers .

'The Obama ""reset"" w Russia needs a reset,' he said. Rep. John Fleming, a Republican from Louisiana, said Obama is 'figuring out now that appeasement toward potential adversaries doesn't work.' But New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte acknowledged that Obama 'made [the] right call in canceling' the bilateral summit with Putin. She cited 'Russia's actions on [Edwards] Snowden, Syria and human rights issues.' Obama will still attend the Group of 20 economic summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, but a top White House official said the president had no plans to hold one-on-one talks with Putin while there. Instead of visiting Putin in Moscow, the president will add a stop in Sweden to his early September travel itinerary. Obama, who is traveling in California, said that the frosty relationship between the U.S. and Russia has come as a result of their actions,  or lack thereof. 'There have been times where they slip back into Cold War thinking and a Cold War mentality,' Obama said in an interview with Jay Leno on The Tonight Show. ‘I was disappointed because even though we don’t have an extradition treaty with them, traditionally we have tried to respect if there’s a law-breaker or an alleged law-breaker in their country, we evaluate it and we try to work with them. They didn’t do that with us. And in some ways it’s reflective of some underlying challenges that we’ve had with Russia lately. Making a statement: President Obama said that he was 'disappointed' with Russia and their decisions on a host of issues . ‘A lot of what’s been going on hasn’t been major breaks in the relationship, and they still help us on supplying our troops in Afghanistan; they’re still helping us on counterterrorism work; they were helpful after the Boston bombing in that investigation.  And so there’s still a lot of business that we can do with them.’ Obama's decision to scrap talks with Putin is also likely to deepen the chill in the already cold relationship between the two leaders. They have frequently found themselves at odds on pressing international issues, most recently in Syria, where the U.S. accuses Putin of helping President Bashar al-Assad fund a civil war. The U.S. has also been a vocal critic of Russia's crackdown on Kremlin critics and recently sanctioned 18 Russians for human rights violations. Opening up: Obama talked to Tonight Show host Jay Leno about Russia and their laws against homosexuals during an appearance on his show on Tuesday night . Moscow has accused the U.S. of installing a missile shield in Eastern Europe as a deterrent against Russia, despite American assurances that the shield is not aimed at its former Cold War foe. Putin also signed a law last year banning U.S. adoptions of Russian children, a move that was seen as retaliation for the U.S. measure that cleared the way for the human rights sanctions. Obama and Putin last met in June on the sidelines of the Group of 8 summit in Northern Ireland. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that 'Putin doesn't deserve the respect after what he's done with Snowden.' 'I know what he's doing. He's trying to make Russia a big power again,' Schumer said on CNN. 'To show him the respect at the bilateral talks doesn't make sense.'","President Obama was expected to have a private meeting with Vladimir Putin while in Russia for upcoming G20 summit .

A driver who apparently collided with a cyclist after a row on the road bragged on Twitter she had 'purposefully run him over' and was 'definitely still drunk' at the time. The motorist, named online as Daisy Abela from Bromley, has since apologised and says she has spoken to the Metropolitan Police about her 'exaggerated' comments, which were picked up by cyclists who began haranguing her. She wrote on Saturday morning: 'Just had . a full on barney with a cyclist he started banging on my roof so I . purposely run him over LOL see yaaaaa #c****' It comes months after accountancy . trainee Emma Way, 21, boasted about having knocked a cyclist off his bike and . through a hedge on Twitter, and she has since been charged with various driving offences. Row: Tweeting under the name Daisy Abela, this driver said she had 'purposely' knocked down a cyclist after a row . Incident: Miss Abela claimed that as she overtook a group of cyclists, one pulled out towards her which led to an altercation (file picture) In this new Twitter storm Miss Abela wrote: 'I was definitely still drunk! If there's anything I hate in this world it's f****** cyclists. 'I didn't kill the poor f*****. I knocked him off his bike but still managed to continue my journey with 1 wing mirror lol.' The tweets led to her getting abuse on Twitter and also on cycling forums, where she was called an 'anti-cyclist moron'. But today Miss Abela has clarified her comments and said the incident was 'not a drunken hit and run' and the tweets were a 'stupid joke'. 'I would like to start off firstly by apologising for any offence I may have caused other cyclists with my tweets on Saturday,' she wrote. 'I did not intend to upset anybody. Truth is I was joking with a friend, I thought it was a conversation between two people. This incident was NOT a drunken hit and run. 'My comments were terribly exaggerated and made in anger after being physically and verbally attacked by the cyclist. 'This was investigated by the Metropolitan Police and has been resolved'. Argument: Tweeting a friend Miss Abela explained how she had driven off with one wing mirror, but she has since said this was exaggerated . Claim: This tweet also said 'I was definitely still drunk' and that the driver hates cyclists . Explaining her side of the story she wrote:  'On Saturday morning at around 9am I was driving behind a group of . cyclists riding 3 a breast when I attempted to overtake at a clear . point.  As I did so, a fourth cyclist also tried to get ahead of the others leading to a near collision. 'I then shouted out of my open window ;you're going to cause a crash . riding like that. 'The cyclist caught up with me. He began hammering on my roof. And spitting at me as he shouted through my window ""what's your f****** problem with cyclists? 'Then there was a brief collision in which nobody was hurt. Not a ""hit . and run"". This could equally have been caused by him cycling into me. 'I did not lose a wing mirror it was merely pushed in. I appreciate how my tweet may have been misinterpreted. 'Nobody was injured during the incident, there was no impact on the cyclist as he continued to scream abuse as he rode off!' The other individual involved has not come forward.

Lord de Mauley said families 'make do and mend' by repairing broken appliances to reduce waste sent to landfill . Families should recapture the spirit of ‘make do and mend’ by repairing broken washing machines, toasters and televisions rather than buying new ones, a Tory minister claimed last night. Lord de Mauley, an environment minister, said even when shopping for new appliances, gadgets and even clothes, people should consider buying second hand goods online on auction websites such as eBay -  to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill. The proposal to make it easier for people to fix or replace households items with good quality used ones is part of a ‘waste prevention programme’ published by the environment department to comply with an EU directive. Ministers say changing our throwaway culture will not only cut down on the tonnes of household waste thrown away every year and help the environment, but will also save families money. ‘Reducing waste is everyone’s responsibility’, Lord de Mauley told the Daily Telegraph, ‘What we have set out in this programme will help businesses save money, help people cut back on waste and pass on items that they would otherwise throw away’. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will first measure the nation’s progress by calculating how many tonnes of waste are produced by households, businesses and industry and setting reduction targets. Businesses and families will be told to take care not to waste food, paper, plastics, and electronic and electrical equipment, according to proposals published in a consultation which will be considered until the end of next month. But Tory MP Douglas Carswell, said: ‘Since when do we need government to tell us what to do with broken toasters? I don’t really want to live in a world where Defra officials can decide what I do with electrical appliances that I could repair.’ Despite this drive to reduce waste, Defra have resisted calls for a charge on single use carrier bags in England, although such a charge has been successful in Wales and Northern Ireland and will begin shortly in Scotland. Banning plastic carrier bags, backed by a Daily Mail campaign, has widespread political support. Families should recapture the spirit of 'make do and mend' by repairing broken washing machines, toasters and televisions rather than buying new ones . The consultation document states that consumers should ‘consider their own buying habits to identify where they could make savings’, for example, through wasting less food. It states: ‘There are several simple practices which all contribute to reducing the amount of waste produced; from reusing shopping bags, repairing items instead of automatically replacing them, passing on items no longer needed or selling them, e.g. through online auction sites’. Making and selling electronic and electrical equipment will face demands from government agencies to make products which last for longer and are easier to repair. Officials say helping people to recycle as much as possible would save British businesses £17 billion a year, while re-using household appliances and furniture could save families £1 billion a year as well as create work for repair shops. As electrical goods have become cheaper, there are fewer electrical repair shops, and the consultation says shopkeepers have a ‘key role’ in convincing people they can have a lifetime of use out of a product. Under European laws, Britain must produce a waste strategy by the end of the year. The EU directive on waste recommends measures including forcing consumers to pay for items of packaging which would otherwise be free to reduce the amount of excess paper and plastic used. Earlier this year, another Defra minister, Richard Benyon warned that families were needlessly wasting ‘enormous amounts of food’ worth  up to £50 of food a month, much of which was ‘perfectly safe’ to eat. According to government figures, about 228 million tonnes of waste is thrown away every year in England.","Lord de Mauley said people should buy second hand goods online .

The widow of a man who was shot to death outside a preschool by her mentally-ill lover knew how her husband had died before anyone told her, the court heard today. Andrea Sneiderman, from Atlanta, called her father-in-law as she was driving to the hospital and told him his son had been shot. This contradicted her own testimony she did not find out until doctors told her at Atlanta Medical Center. The police detective who had comforted Sneiderman when she arrived at the murder scene testified today that she specifically did not tell her how her husband had died. 'There was no way I was going to tell someone they lost a loved one in a . parking lot,' Dunwoody Police Detective Jesus Maldonado said, adding that it was 'not obvious' what had happened from the scene. Emotional: Andrea Sneiderman wipes tears from her eyes as the court is shown footage of the moment she claims to have found out her husband was dead . Hard to listen to: She closes her eyes as tears run down her cheeks at court on Wednesday, August 7 . Tears: Andrea Sneiderman becomes emotional as she listens to defense attorney Tom Clegg's opening arguments at her trial on Monday, August 5, 2013 . Defense atorney Tom Clegg: Sneiderman is accused of lying under oath and hindering the investigation into her husband's death . Torn apart: Russell Sneiderman was murdered after dropping his children off at daycare . Donald Sneiderman returned to the witness stand Wednesday morning to say he suspected Andrea Sneiderman was involved with her son's murder . Sneiderman's lover Hemy Neuman was . last year convicted of the murder of Rusty Sneiderman and sentenced to . life in prison. He told police an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it. The mother-of-two was initially accused of arranging her husband's murder but the charges were later dropped. She currently stands trial on . 13 felony charges, including perjury, making false statements to police . and hindering the apprehension of a criminal. Police said she lied to . them about her affair with Hemy. Yesterday Rusty's father Don . Sneiderman said his daughter-in-law called him and told him what . happened while she was on the way to the hospital. 'There are some calls you never forget,' he said. But Sneiderman herself testified at her lover's murder trial that she 'didn’t . know what happened to Rusty until I got to the emergency room. No one . told me what happened to Rusty', Fox Atlanta reported. On Monday, Sneiderman's defense . attorneys painted her out as a happily married mother devastated by her . husband's death, not the woman prosecutors described as engaged in a . 'forbidden romance' with her boss. The contrasting portraits of . Sneiderman emerged during opening statements in her trial on charges of . lying under oath and hindering the investigation into her husband's . death. DeKalb County prosecutor Kellie Hill told the jury: 'The evidence will show a forbidden . romance that ends in murder, silence despite her suspicion, and lies to . conceal the truth from her family, from her friends, from the police and . from a jury.' Accused: Andrea Sneiderman smiles as the jury comes into the Dekalb County Superior Court before opening statements were given by attorneys . Lovers turned fighters: Andrea Sneiderman (left) was having an affair with her then-boss Hemy Neuman (right) when he shot and killed her husband Rusty . Bereaved: Don and Marilyn Sneiderman, parents of murder victim Rusty Sneiderman, listen to opening arguments at the trial of Andrea Sneiderman . Sneiderman's husband, 36-year-old . Rusty Sneiderman, was fatally shot in November 2010 outside a suburban . Atlanta preschool while he was dropping his son off. Neuman was convicted of the killing in March 2012, but he was found to be mentally ill. He told mental health examiners . he was visited by a demon whose voice sounded like Barry White and an . angel who looked like Olivia Newton-John. The angel ordered him to . fatally shoot Sneiderman, Neuman said in one interview. 37-year-old Sneiderman has pleaded not guilty and has repeatedly denied any romantic relationship with Neuman. DeKalb . County prosecutor Kellie Hill told the jury that evidence in the case . will show that soon after Sneiderman took a job at General Electric, she . formed a friendship with Neuman that quickly blossomed into a romantic . relationship. But because she was married with young children, she felt conflicted about it and was hot and cold with Neuman, Hill said. Emails the state plans to present show 'she feels torn between her reality and her desires,' Hill said. Andrea . Sneiderman had willingly participated in a relationship with Neuman, . sharing deep personal secrets with him, sending him photos of her . children, and sharing kisses and other physical contact with him during . business trips, Hill said. But . she failed to tell police about her relationship with Neuman and failed . to tell them she suspected he might be involved, Hill said. 'If the police had known about the relationship, they would have known why someone wanted Rusty dead,' she said. Sneiderman also lied under oath . during Neuman's trial last year, denying the romantic relationship and . lying about when she found out her husband had been shot, Hill said. As . she was driving to the preschool after getting a call from an employee . there about an emergency, she called her father-in-law and told him his . son had been shot, even though no one had told her that yet, Hill said. Cuffed: Andrea Sneiderman, 37, is on trial for charges including lying under oath, perjury and hindering the investigation into the murder of her husband, Rusty Sneiderman . Sorrow: Don Sneiderman, left, reacts after the reading of the verdict of the Hemy Neuman trial in the DeKalb County Courthouse on March 15, 2012, in Decatur, Georgia . Defense . attorney Tom Clegg told jurors that Sneiderman told police the day . after her husband's killing that Neuman had tried to break up her . family. She was happily . married, brushed aside advances from Neuman at work and never . complained to human resources because she didn't want to create problems . for herself and couldn't imagine he would do harm, Clegg said. 'The . bottom line is Hemy Neuman was a pest, Hemy Neuman was a nuisance. Hemy . Neuman, to this woman, was not a threat,' Clegg said. Sneiderman cooperated with police and suggested Neuman might have been involved, Clegg said. She . was so broken up over her husband's death that, on what would have been . their 10th wedding anniversary, she put on her wedding dress and went . to the synagogue in Florida where they got married, hoping to feel his . spirit, Clegg said. The . state called several witnesses on Monday, including a waitress who said . she served drinks to Neuman and Andrea Sneiderman in Greenville, South . Carolina, in October 2010, and a hotel front desk clerk from Longmont, . Colorado. The state also showed several video clips of Andrea Sneiderman's testimony from Neuman's trial. In one video clip, Sneiderman is shown talking about a business trip she and Neuman took to Greenville, South Carolina. She . testified they had dinner and then went to a bar. They had one or two . drinks, she got up and danced alone and then he joined her on the dance . floor and twirled her, she testified. They had no contact other than partner dancing, she said. The . state called Christine Olivera, a bartender who was working that night. Sneiderman seemed upset when they arrived and took her cellphone with . her to the bathroom, Olivera said. When . she came back to the bar, she had sipped her drink and seemed to cheer . up, Olivera said. Neuman led Sneiderman onto the dance floor and after a . short while, Sneiderman danced flirtatiously, as if she were seducing . Neuman, Olivera said. Unusual urgings: During his trial, Neuman said that an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it, as did a demon who sounded like Barry White . The . two kissed more than once and eventually left the bar in each other's . arms, pausing to kiss on the sidewalk, Olivera testified. In a video clip from Neuman's trial, . Sneiderman is seen testifying that Neuman was in Longmont, Colorado, at . the same time she was there for work in July 2010 and that she believed . he was there for work. But in an email exchange from that time that she . reads aloud, Neuman tells her he was not there for business. When a lawyer asks her about that, she says she supposes he was there to see her, maybe to stalk her. The state called Brady Blackburn, a front desk clerk from the hotel where Sneiderman stayed in Colorado. In . an employee log from the hotel, there is a message from another clerk . saying Neuman called and instructing Blackburn to read a short love note . to Andrea Sneiderman. Blackburn . also testified that hotel records showed that he checked Sneiderman . into her room and that her booking was modified from one guest to two. Sneiderman was arrested at a home in .

An art expert slapped his wife across the face while driving in busy west London as their two children watched from the rear seat - just two days after police cautioned him for another assault on his spouse. Damian Brenninkmeyer, 42, former head of the Old Masters department at Christies, pleaded guilty at Hammersmith Magistrate's Court to assaulting his wife of 10 years, Fiona, on July 7. Now banned from his family's Fulham postcode, he is living with his father in Kingston-upon-Thames. He was bailed until August 29 for a pre-sentence report. Nevertheless, his lawyer Mark Haslam told the court: 'This is a . marriage both parties think can be saved and there is an email from his . wife to that effect.' On that Sunday afternoon, Mr Brenninkmeyer had been driving with his wife, an artist, and their two daughters to her mother's home Buckinghamshire, said prosecutor Paul Mitchell. 'Mrs Brenninkmeyer could sense a bad mood and was afraid the defendant would get angry with her, but he assured her everything was going to be okay,' he said. 'They were driving along Fulham Palace Road when the defendant became aggressive and started shouting: 'I want to punish you for what you did to me'.' The court heard Brenninkmeyer was still angry with his wife for calling the police two days earlier and told her: 'I'm going to break your phone and tell the accountant not to allow you to have another.' 'She said, ""Please calm down for the kids"". But he started to bash his fists on the steering wheel while they were still moving,' continued Mr Mitchell. 'He then back-hand hit her across the right side of her face. Admission: Mr Brenninkmeyer, left, admitted assaulting his wife Fiona, right . 'He was driving erratically so she decided to call the police and grabbed her phone, but Mr Brenninkmeyer grabbed her hand, clawing at her hand. 'He gave up, but grabbed her sunglasses from her lap and threw them out of the window. 'The right side of her face was throbbing and she could see bruising as the journey continued and at Beaconsfield Services she took the two girls into a service area and cried. 'Mr. Brenninkmeyer said: 'Why don't you get back in the car? You're causing a scene'.' There was another row back at the family home that night when Brenninkmeyer discovered his wife had taken money from their joint account to pay a cleaner and he pushed her down onto a sofa. Rage: Mr Brenninkmeyer lashed out at Fiona, pictured relaxing on a holiday, while driving . 'Things must never come to fisticuffs': Brenninkmeyer was rebuked by a judge at Hamersmith Magistrates Court . After hearing Brenninkmeyer's guilty plea, District Judge Susan Williams said: 'Slugging his wife across the face while while driving on a busy road with two children in the back is one of the most dangerous things you can do. 'Things must never come to fisticuffs.' The defendant was assured the bail conditions would not prohibit him seeing his daughters. 'The children will have to see their father and I am sure the fact that he is not at home is distressing to them,' said Mrs Williams. 'This is a marriage we want to see back on the right tracks and this has to be a warning to him that something needs to be done.' The court heard Brenninkmeyer, who worked at Christie's until 2010 and has also previously worked for London auctioneers Bonhams & Butterfields, has been undergoing treatment for anxiety.

In a challenge to the prime minister, who has so far refused to spell out in detail how he will approach a renegotiation with Brussels, Business For Britain will call for the UK to be a member of a ‘customs union’ – an area with close trading ties but no more. Their intervention will call on Mr Cameron to ditch support for the single market on the grounds that it creates much of the red tape that British businesses find so onerous. It would put Britain in a similar position to Switzerland and Turkey, countries which both have access to EU markets but are not forced to comply with every regulation from Brussels. Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell said the prime minister should be encouraged rather than threatened by the plans since they would allow Conservatives to vote to stay in the EU. He said: ‘We’ve been so fixated on the single market that people have not drawn the distinction between having market access and single market compliance. 'This gives us  a sense of what membership would need to be if we were to vote to stay in. It sets out quite an appealing vision.’ Intervention: Eurosceptics will call on Mr Cameron to ditch support for the single market . Mastermind: Tory strategist Matthew Elliott is running the group of up to 100 MPs . Ideas suggested by the government for the renegotiation so far – including a red card system for national parliaments to block unwelcome EU plans – have not challenged the basis of Britain’s role in the EU. The Business For Britain manifesto will argue that the UK is unlikely to be able to pick and choose which single market regulations it can keep and which it can ditch, so it would make more sense to pull out altogether. One source close to the project said: ‘The manifesto will conclude that we should be in a customs union, not the single market. ‘What’s important for Britain is to make sure there are no trade barriers with our European partners. The support from Tory MPs is considerable.’ Dozens of MPs have already given their private backing to the plans, which they see as returning to the European Economic Community that Britain joined four decades ago. Some Labour MPs are also signed up to the group, which is backed by John Mills, the millionaire businessman who is Labour’s largest donor.","Up to 100 MPs to back a tough Business For Britain manifesto in November .
