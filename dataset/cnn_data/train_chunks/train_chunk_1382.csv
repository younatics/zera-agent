"A petition has been launched to save the Natural History Museum's adored diplodocus skeleton following an announcement it is to be pulled from the museum's great entrance hall and replaced with a blue whale. It was revealed yesterday museum bosses are to replace it because it was no longer considered relevant, while its replacement blue whale would act as a reminder of 'our responsibility to the planet'. But the decision has backfired, with the 110-year-old diplodocus - affectionately known as Dippy - now the focus of a vociferous campaign calling for it to remain where it has enthralled millions for the past 110 years. Scroll down for video . The Diplodocus skeleton in the main central hall of the Natural History Museum (pictured) is to be removed . Affectionately known as Dippy, it was unveiled at a special ceremony at the museum at 1pm on May 12, 1905 . Dippy's replacement is to be a blue whale skeleton, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, and a resident of the museum since 1891. Pictured is an artist's illustration of what it will look like . The campaign, aptly titled 'Save Dippy', has so far gathered more than 14,000 signatures. The online petition states Dippy is 'loved around the world and is a monument of British heritage. Replacing Dippy with a blue whale skeleton would threaten this and lead to many unhappy faces. 'He has inspired generations of schoolchildren to look back to the earth's past and help them think about looking after the planet's future.' Furthermore, it demanded 'Dippy is saved and remains in the main hall forever'. The change is part of a 'decade of transformation' planned at the museum by its director, Sir Michael Dixon. Dippy is a fake - one of 10 replicas around the world based on the near-complete skeleton of a real Diplodocus unearthed in Wyoming, US, in 1898 and housed at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. If the change goes ahead as planned, from summer 2017, it will be replaced with the 83ft long real skeleton of a blue whale, suspended in a diving motion from the ceiling of the central Hintze Hall. An artist's impression of how the blue whale skeleton will look. It will welcome visitors as the central display in the Natural History Museum's Hintze Hall from summer 2017 . An artist's impression of how the skeleton of the blue whale will look suspended and 'diving' from the ceiling . The whale skeleton is shown here in the Mammal Hall, where is has long been the centrepiece . The whale, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, and a resident of the museum since 1891, is a symbol of environmental destruction and hope, Sir Michael said. The biggest animal ever to have lived on Earth at 160 tonnes, it was hunted to near extinction for its oil, meat and body parts. It is still endangered but its population has recovered ten-fold after being granted protected status in 1967. Sir Michael said: 'The story of the blue whale reminds us of the scale of our responsibility to the planet. Our purpose is to challenge the way people think about the natural world, and that goal has never been more urgent.' Dippy, however, won't be left in pieces in a dusty cupboard. There are plans to send the model on a tour of the UK. 'Dippy's an icon of the museum but the new exhibit will allow us to tell a range of stories,' Sir Michael said. The museum recently unveiled a stegosaurus exhibit which, unlike the diplodocus, is made of real fossils. Sophie the stegosaurus is the most complete dinosaur to go on display at the museum for over a century, and the most complete stegosaurus specimen in the world. The Natural History Museum holds over 80million specimens, including mammoth skeletons and items from the voyages of Charles Darwin and Captain James Cook. The museum has a moon rock brought back from the Apollo 17 mission, the only piece in the UK. It keeps a 900-strong colony of tiny flesh-eating beetles, which it uses to strip carcasses down to skeletons for study or display. The most valued fossil in the museum's collection is the archaeopteryx, or the 'first bird', which is 150million years old. The Natural History Museum's great hall photographed in 1895. It was designed by Alfred Waterhouse (1830-1905) and opened to the public on Easter Monday, 1881 . This sperm whale skeleton stood in the central hall between 1882 and 1901. The whale was found near Thurso, Scotland, in 1863, and two years later its skeleton was presented to the Museum by Captain D. Macdonald . The Natural History Museum (pictured left in 1882) welcomes more than five million visitors a year.

"America's famous Smithsonian Institution, home to the original star-spangled banner and Neil Armstrong's spacesuit, hopes to set up a British outpost - but it will not share many of its most famous artefacts. It will be the world's biggest museum's first foreign branch and is proposed for the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London. Entry to the new £33million gallery, proposed on the site of the London 2012 water polo arena and due to open in 2021, would be free like the majority of the capital's museums. But it appears many of the Smithsonian's most celebrated exhibits in Washington, which also includes the Wright brothers' Flyer and Thomas Edison's first light bulb, would not come to the UK. London outpost: America's Smithsonian Institution, the world's biggest museum, is to open a new home abroad in the Olympic Park, which will also bring in a host of other new projects . Star attraction: This flag raised when America defeated Britain in 1812 is one of the Smithsonian's most famous artefacts - but it is too fragile to travel to Britain . The 'iconic' flag raise to celebrate Britain's defeat in America in 1812, which inspired the American national anthem, is considered 'too fragile'. A decision has not been made on Dorothy's ruby slippers from 'The Wizard of Oz,' the Apollo space capsule that carried the first moon landers or art recovered when the British set fire to the White House. But the proposed 40,000-square-foot Smithsonian gallery would feature permanent and rotating exhibits from Smithsonian sites including the National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of American History and National Museum of Natural History and various art galleries. The Louvre, The Guggenheim, the British Museum, the Tate Gallery and The Hermitage are other major museums also to have expanded globally. Smithsonian Acting Secretary Al Horvath said: 'We envision this as being a Smithsonian facility that really allows us to show the breadth and depth of everything that we do. 'So it won't be specifically focused on one topic but will allow us to run the gamut of things that we do - history, science, art, culture and the like'. History: Neil Armstrong's spacesuit worn on the moon and Louis Armstrong's first cornet is among 137million items held by the museum . First flight: The Wright brothers' Flyer is also held. Orville Wright is shown here at the controls watched by his brother Wilbur at Kitty Hawk in 1903 . John McCarter, chairman of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, added: 'It's a great opportunity for us to get started and really to tell America's story.' It will be funded by donations raised by Mayor of London Boris Johnson and entrance fees for special exhibitions. The Washington Smithsonian, which is the world's largest museum, was set up in 1846 using money from James Smithson, a British scientist who never went to the Unites States. From geologic features such as Plymouth Rock to undeniable antique treasures including Abraham Lincoln's stovepipe hat, the Smithsonian has 137million artefacts across 19 museums. The London branch would be at the heart of the 'Olympicopolis' cultural centre that would open in 2021. New location: The Smithsonian, pictured in Washington, will share its site with the V&A, and will be free like most of London's museums . The V&A, Sadler's Wells and London College of Fashion would share the site with the new Smithsonian. Around it will be West Ham's new home in the Olympic Stadium, an international broadcast centre taken over by BT and a new University College London Campus. Boris Johnson said: 'It would be a massive coup to attract the Smithsonian Institution to east London. 'It will be a  bright shining star in a constellation of heavenly bodies'.","World's biggest museum set to open in London's Olympic Park in 2021 .

"The entire International Space Station was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station. The remarkable manoeuvre saw a European spacecraft ‘slow’ the speed of the station. This changed the height of its orbit very slightly, by about 1.6 miles (2.5km), before the station was spun back again to its original position. A European spacecraft was used to lower the orbit of the ISS yesterday (illustrated). The ATV was used to 'slow' the station and move it down by 2.5km. But to do so required Nasa to first spin the station 180 degrees. It was then spun back again when the boost was completed . To move the station, the thrusters of Esa’s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) were fired. Usually, boosts are performed by a spacecraft docked to the ISS to raise the height of the space station or to avoid debris. The orbit of the ISS is regularly maintained, sometimes several times a year, but it is fairly rare for an ATV to be used for the procedure. The Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) is an unmanned spacecraft built by Esa that is used to bring cargo to the ISS. The latest to be docked to the station, ATV-5, was the fifth and final cargo spacecraft Esa was contracted to supply the station with. ATVs are given names honouring great scientists, and this one was named after Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaître. The previous four were named Jules Verne, Johannes Kepler, Edoardo Amaldi and Albert Einstein. ATV-5 was launched on 29 July 2014 and arrived at the station on 12 August 2014. It does not have the capability to return to Earth, so on 27 February 2015 it will be sent to burn up in Earth's atmosphere - with waste from the ISS on board. By boosting ‘backwards’, the ISS speeds up in its orbit - and its altitude is slightly raised. But in this instance, Nasa made the decision to lower the altitude of the space station by 1.6 miles (2.5km). To do this, the ATV had to boost against the orbit of the ISS - and as it is docked to a Russian service module at the back of the station, the ISS had to be spun around so it was facing forwards. This was done using thrusters and gyrsocopes on the station. ‘The boost was weak, so the crew noticed no change,’ a source at Esa told MailOnline. ‘By lowering the orbit of the ISS, what happens is the apogee [the point where the ISS is furthest from Earth, as its orbit is very slightly elliptical] is lowered by 2.5km [1.6 miles].' Combined with the drift and drag from Earth's atmosphere, this will eventually bring the ISS down by a total of about 9.3 miles (15km). This will lower the altitude of its orbit from about 258 miles (415km) to around 249 miles (400km). ‘What this does is it sets up the phasing for the next docking, which is [Russia’s] Progress spacecraft,' the source continued, 'and it means Progress will not have to use as much fuel to catch up and get to the ISS.’ The major benefit of this is that the incoming spacecraft will be able to carry more cargo, as it will not need to carry as much fuel. To lower the orbit of the 400,000kg ISS yesterday, it was first necessary to spin the entire station 180 degrees - to bring Esa's ATV round from the 'back' to the 'front'. This was done using thrusters on board the station, which can alter its orientation. Once the station had been spun, the ATV then fired its thrusters from 18.40.00 GMT to 18.44.49 GMT yesterday - just less than five minutes in total. After this boost, the station was then spun back again to its original position. The ISS also has reaction wheels on it - gyroscopes that can be spun to change the orientation of the station. A source at Esa told MailOnline that the crew on the ISS would barely have felt the move, if at all, and would have continued with their regular activities as normal. Boosts like this are sometimes performed by other spacecraft when the orbit of the ISS needs to be maintained, or it needs to avoid a bit of debris. The use of an ATV to boost the station is fairly rare, though; the last time it was used for such a purpose was back in 2008, for an unplanned debris avoidance manoeuvre. To lower the orbit of the 400,000kg ISS (pictured) yesterday, it was first necessary to spin the entire station 180 degrees - to bring Esa's ATV round from the 'back' to the 'front'. It is understood that, despite seeming fairly dramatic, spinning the station is actual a fairly routine manoeuvre - using its  thrusters and gyroscopes . To highlight how easy it is to move the ISS, this picture taken by Italian Esa astronaut Paolo Nespoli in 2011 shows the entire space station at a slight angle. The Space Shuttle is seen docked at the top, while a previous European ATV vehicle is seen docked at the bottom . The Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), pictured left is ATV-4, is an unmanned spacecraft built by Esa that is used to bring cargo to the ISS. Lowering the station will allow an upcoming Russian cargo spacecraft known as Progress, previously pictured right, to bring more cargo to the ISS . It’s believed that one of the reason’s this boost was required is due to the explosion of Orbital Sciences’ Antares rocket on 28 October 2014. This rocket had been due to carry the Cygnus spacecraft to the station, which would have brought vital cargo with it. But the loss of the spacecraft means that others have to pick up the slack - so by lowering the orbit of the ISS, they can add slightly more cargo to their loads. This means more essential items like food and tools can be carried. While the ISS was not running critically low on any particular type of cargo, its understood by MailOnline that the water on board was reaching fairly low levels. The arrival of ATV-5 in August, though, brought about 1,875lbs (850kg) of water to the station - the last 265lbs (120kg) of which were transferred to the ISS today. It’s believed that one of the reasons the station's orbit had to be lowered was due to the explosion of Orbital Sciences’ Antares rocket (shown) on 28 October 2014. This rocket had been due to carry the Cygnus spacecraft to the station, which would have brought vital cargo with it .","A European spacecraft was used to lower the orbit of the ISS yesterday .

"An Ohio judge ordered the state to return 11 exotic animals - six tigers, a black leopard, lion, Kodiak bear, liger, and bobcat - to an animal sanctuary  only hours after they were taken away. Judge Reeve Kelsey issued an injunction yesterday ordering that the animals should be returned to owner Kenny Hetrick's farm at Stony Ridge for their safety. The state had tranquilized and transported the animals to a holding facility near Columbus after Hetrick was denied a permit to keep them. A wolf hybrid that lives on Hetrick's property was not seized because state law does not prohibit that type of animal. Scroll down for video . A tranquilized tiger is removed by state officials from Tiger Ridge Exotics animal farm in Stony Ridge, Ohio . A tiger looks on as another tranquilized animal is removed from Tiger Ridge Exotics by Ohio officials . A tranquilized tiger being taken from the animal farm. Owner Kenny Hetrick hoped to keep the animals after volunteers helped him improve his facility . State veterinarians at the facility will evaluate the animals to determine if they are ready for the 130-mile return trip. It's unclear when they will be brought back to Tiger Ridge. Erica Hawkins, an Agriculture Department spokeswoman, said: 'We're not going to transport them until they're safe.' She added it's possible the state could also look into other legal options. 'They shouldn't have been taken in the first place,' Hetrick said after the injunction was granted by Judge  Kelsey, according to the Toledo Blade. 'I should have had a hearing and I never got one.' 'Today, the Ohio Department of Agriculture did the right thing by seizing the wild animals at Tiger Ridge Exotics who have been held illegally and long neglected. Now, it's been reported that the animals will possibly have to endure the stress of being tranquilized again and moved back to the roadside zoo—a potentially life-threatening move. This is a selfish stunt to prevent the animals from being sent to a sanctuary where they would finally receive the care that they so desperately need. PETA is calling on the facility to do the right thing and allow these animals to enjoy a peaceful life at a reputable sanctuary where their needs would come first.' Source: Toledo News Now . Hetrick has been fighting to keep the animals since October, when the state said he needed to  surrender them because he had failed to get the necessary permits to keep them. If he did not voluntarily surrender the animals they would be taken from him by the state, it said. In order to obtain a permit, owners are required to pass a background check, pay fees, obtain liability insurance or surety bonds and show they can properly contain and care for animals. Regulators denied Hetrick's permit because it was filed late and an inspection found that the facility's fencing was not adequate, some padlocks and chains were not secured and some cages had exposed metal that could have harmed the animals. However, volunteers have helped Hetrick make improvements at the farm. Exotic animal owners in Ohio were required to obtain a permit after dozens of wild animals were released by a suicidal owner at his eastern Ohio farm in Zanesville in 2011. Authorities hunted down and killed most of those animals, among them black bears, Bengal tigers and African lions. Hetrick's daughter said the family is 'not going to stand for it.' Corrina Hetrick added: 'We're going to fight it to the end. We're not giving up.' A hearing on a permanent injunction stopping the seizure of the animals is set for February 10. Sheriff's deputies shot 48 wild animals  - including 18 rare Bengal tigers and 17 lions -  when a suicidal owner released dozens of wild animals from his eastern Ohio farm in Zanesville in 2011 . A sign posted on Interstate 70 warned drivers of animals on the loose in the area around Zanesville in 2011 . A petition has been started on Change.org urging Ohio Governor John Kasich to help keep Tiger Ridge Exotics open. It reads: 'Kenny Hetrick of Tigerridge [sic] exotics has been home to many, many exotic big cats. 'He has been open free of charge 365 days a year for over 20 years. 'He has been USDA licensed since 1989 and has provided a safe and healthy environment for the animals. We are in need of all the public support to fight this. 'This is not some road side zoo, this is a place where thousands of people have brought their families to see some of the most beautiful creatures on earth. 'These animals are well taken care of, and have never harmed anyone. 'We just want them to be able to finish out their lives at home where they belong. 'The animals are in extreme danger of being yanked from the only home they have ever known to be either killed or placed in another facility no better than ours.' Almost 4,100 people have already signed the petition. Tigers featured in the Russell Crowe film Gladiator were born at Tiger Ridge, according to the farm's official website.","Owner had six tigers, a black leopard, lion, Kodiak bear, liger and bobcat .

"Decapitated corpses have turned up in the Ivory Coast after a wave of child murders - with one attacker calmly telling police that God had told him 'to cut off children's heads ... and then I would be made king.' More than 20 children have vanished in the past few months, with their bodies found mutilated. But one suspected killer was caught after he tried to attack two boys while they were fetching water from a well in in Yopougon, a suburb of Abidjan, on January 25. Those gathered around the well watched in horror as Cedric, 14, and Souleymane, 10, were attacked by Drissa Coulibaly with a machete. Decapitated corpses have turned up in the Ivory Coast after a wave of child murders. Pictured, Cedric, 14, survived an attack in Yopougon, a suburb of Abidjan . The attacker was caught after came at Souleymane, pictured,  while they were fetching water from a well in in Yopougon, a suburb of Abidjan, on January 25 . Souleymane was in shock, but he survived, unlike many victims of a wave of child murders in the Ivory Coast. He said: 'The man came out with a machete. I fell down. He started to hack at me.' The would-be killer went after Souleymane, then Cedric, before a soldier from a nearby base saw what was happening and chased the man away. 'I thought he had come to collect water, said Cedric. 'But he pulled out a machete. He tried to cut me up.' As word spread, soldiers from the nearby base quickly fanned out and tracked down the attacker. Once in police custody, he reportedly confessed to at least three murders. Giving his name as Drissa Coulibaly, the suspect wore a red and white robe, filthy after months of living on the street. Drissa Coulibaly, left, and right, with his machete, was detained in Abidjan after attacking two boys at a well. He told police that God had told him 'to cut off children's heads ... and then I would be made king' Souleymane, a 10-year-old boy, survived an attack, but at least 25 children have not been as lucky . He calmly told police that God had told him 'to cut off children's heads ... and then I would be made king.' 'God told me to do this. God told me to cut off children's heads and bring them to him and then I would be made king,' Coulibaby, 38, told AFP from custody. 'I told him that I didn't want to do this but he insisted,' he added. His goal was to win his 'swords' of royalty, and he said he communicated with God by way of 'angels' in the shape of crows. 'Either he is very intelligent (and pretending to be mad) or he is very crazy,' one investigator said. Cedric's mother, market seller Daniele Kone, was present when the attacker was questioned by troops. 'He's a very confident man. Not a madman,' she said. 'He is used to doing this.' She told AFP that the suspect 'said he had already killed three children' for Internet clients known as 'browsers', a charge Coulibaly has since denied. Browsers is the term used for delinquents who specialise in Internet scams and are widely regarded as behind the child murders, though proof is scanty. Father Norbert Abekan, a charismatic Abidjan preacher, charged in an article last week that some browsers sought 'human sacrifices the better to swindle'. Cedric's mother Danielle Gueu said: 'He's a very confident man. Not a madman. He is used to doing this' 'Fortunately, his machete was not well sharpened,' Corporal Habib Tito said after the search. 'He was determined to get the two children. 'Had it not been for the presence of one of our men, the smallest boy would be dead,' he added. At least 20 children have not been as lucky as Souleymane and Cedric. In the last two to three months, police opened 25 unexplained cases of child kidnappings, followed by murders, across the country. First Lady Dominique Ouattara spoke out Tuesday against 'horrible and inhuman acts that nothing can justify'. 'It isn't right that parents should grow anxious each time their children go out of the front door of their houses,' she said. Police called the murder toll extremely high, saying it is 'a real and unusual phenomenon', which has shocked Ivorians and spread fears that youngsters have become victims of ritual sacrifices. Brindou M'Bia, the director general of national police, has said most bodies have been found 'mutilated, with their genital parts missing, or decapitated'. 'We know the typology of ritual crimes very well,' Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko added. Women fetch water from a well near the site where two boys were attacked, in Yopougon, a suburb of Abidjan . 'People are led to believe that through these crimes, they can gain power or money.' He said 1,500 police and troops were being mobilised 'to patrol the areas with a high crime rate'. The spate of child killings has prompted some hysterical responses, from warnings posted on Facebook to alarmist text messages. Kidnappings are reported on an almost daily basis. 'Thieves of children grab them by force even from grown-ups or kidnap them around schools, or even go into homes pretending to be visitors or census agents,' an SMS sent to an AFP journalist charged. The impoverished west African nation, which has suffered a decade of political and military crisis, is set to hold a presidential election in October. The wildest rumours about people disappearing for human sacrifice in rituals, particularly albinos, always circulate in the Ivory Coast in electoral years when politicians seek gains at the polls. The kidnappings have led to calls for action from the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, which urged authorities to do . everything possible to quickly identify those responsible. 'UNICEF is deeply worried by the kidnapping of children and . the mutilated bodies that have been found,' Adele Khudr, UNICEF'srepresentative in the Ivory Coast, said in a statement. Police say at least 20 children have disappeared in the last few months and many of their corpses were mutilated or decapitated .","Decapitated and mutilated corpses found after a wave of child murders .

"Ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia wants to see men and women compete in separate Olympics with a controversial proposal to joint-host segregated games. An official from the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee floated the idea of male athletes competing in his country while a female games would be held in neighbouring Bahrain. Prince Fahad bin Jalawi Al Saud, an international relations consultant to the president of the Saudi committee, told French sports website Frances Jeux that he could see the country bidding for the Olympics with another Gulf state. Scroll down for video . Sarah Attar was the first ever female Saudi athlete to compete at the Olympics on the track at London 2012 . The ultra-conservative Gulf state has suggested men and women could compete in separate games . The International Olympic Committee has poured cold water on Saudi proposals for a segregated competition . Acknowledging certain 'cultural constraints' made it difficult to imagine having women compete in his home country, Fahad said: 'Our society can be very conservative. 'It has a hard time accepting that women can compete in sports, especially in swimming. 'Wearing sports clothing in public is not really allowed. For these cultural reasons, it is difficult to bid for certain big international events.' But Fahad maintained a compromise was possible, proposing an arrangement with another Middle Eastern country such as Bahrain. He said: 'We could envisage it with Bahrain. 'We have always had a form of cooperation with that country. 'Bahrain would hold the women's events, we would hold the men's competitions.' Dalma Rushdi Malhas was meant to compete for Saudi Arabia at London 2012 before her horse got injured . Saudi Arabia sent female athletes to the Olympics for the first time at London 2012, caving in to pressure from the International Olympic Committee after the only other countries never to field women competitors, Qatar and Brunei, agreed to do so. Saudi conservatives denounced the country's two female competitors in London, 800-metre runner Sarah Attar and judoka Wojdan Shaherkani, as 'prostitutes' on social media. Attar finished last in her heat, some 45 seconds behind the winner, while running in a hijab and Sharia-compliant sportswear. Shaherkani, only 16 at the time, was eliminated after less than a minute of her one and only fight. Showjumper Dalma Rushdi Malhas was the only female Saudi athlete who actually met Olympic standards of qualification, but had to pull out of the games after her horse was injured. The opening ceremony at the Olympic stadium in east London. Saudi Arabia sent female athletes to compete at the games for the first time . Hard-line religious clerics in Saudi Arabia are often uncomfortable with women exercising, warning that it may expose them to licentiousness and blur gender boundaries. Judoka Wojdan Shaherkani was just 16 when she competed for Saudi Arabia at London 2012 . Female athletes have a hard time finding facilities to train and are not allowed to attend matches in stadiums. The IOC swiftly dismissed Fahad's suggestion for a segregated games. Committee president Thomas Bach told the Associated Press: 'A commitment to ""non-discrimination"" will be mandatory for all countries hoping to bid for the Olympics in the future. 'This was made very clear in the Olympic Agenda 2020 reforms and will even be in the host city contract. 'If this is not applied, the bid would not be admissible. Countries like Saudi Arabia must really work to allow female athletes to freely participate.' Fahad said in his interview that a Saudi-Bahrain joint candidacy would be allowed under the Olympic Agenda 2020 reform package approved by the IOC in Monaco. The changes opened the door to holding events outside a host city or country, as well as possible joint bids by cities, neighboring countries or regions, but only in 'exceptional cases'. But IOC spokesman Mark Adams added: 'You cannot simply ""outsource"" certain issues to another territory,' when asked about the Saudi suggestion.","Men would compete in the Gulf state and women in neighbouring Bahrain .

"Astronomers have witnessed a supermassive black hole attempting to eat a star by stretching it into a 'noodle shape'. While scientists have seen black holes swallow stars before, this one is special rare because it's not going down easy. In fact, the black hole is 'choking' on the star located three billion light years away because its enormous gravity is pulling down hard on one side of stellar body. Scroll down for video… . When a star encounters a black hole, tidal forces stretch the star into an elongated blob before tearing it apart, as seen in these images from a computer simulation . The remarkable discovery was made using a tiny telescope at the McDonald Observatory in Texas in January 2009. With a magnitude of -22.5, this event was as bright as the 'superluminous supernovae' - a new category of the brightest stellar explosions known. The team nicknamed the 2009 event 'Dougie,' after a character in the cartoon South Park and thought he might be a supernova. 'When we discovered this new object, it looked similar to supernovae we had known already,' said lead author Jozsef Vinko of the University of Szeged in Hungary. 'But when we kept monitoring its light variation, we realised that this was something nobody really saw before. The giant black hole at the center of the Milky Way may be producing mysterious particles called neutrinos, researchers believe. If confirmed, this would be the first time that scientists have traced neutrinos back to a black hole. Researchers say the find could help explain how cosmic rays are produced, and solve a key mystery about how the universe operates. The evidence came from three Nasa satellites that observe in X-ray light: the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Swift gamma-ray mission, and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). 'Figuring out where high-energy neutrinos come from is one of the biggest problems in astrophysics today,' said Yang Bai of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, who co-authored a study about these results published in Physical Review D. 'We now have the first evidence that an astronomical source – the Milky Way's supermassive black hole – may be producing these very energetic neutrinos.' 'Finding out that it was probably a supermassive black hole eating a star was a fascinating experience. Team member J. Craig Wheeler, leader of the supernova group at the University of Texas at Austin said: 'We got the idea that it might be a 'tidal disruption' event.' This means that the enormous gravity of a black hole pulls on one side of the star harder than the other side, creating tides that rip the star apart. 'A star wanders near a black hole, the star's side nearer the black hole is pulled' on more than the star's far side, he said. 'These especially large tides can be strong enough that you pull the star out into a noodle' shape. The star 'doesn't fall directly into the black hole,' Wheeler said. 'It might form a disk first. But the black hole is destined to swallow most of that material.' Based on the characteristics of the light from Dougie, and their deductions of the star's original mass, the team has determined that Dougie started out as a Sun-like star, before being ripped apart. Their observations of the host galaxy, coupled with Dougie's behaviour, led them to conclude that the galaxy's central black hole has the 'rather modest' mass of about a million suns, Wheeler said. Delving into Dougie's behaviour has unexpectedly resulted in learning more about small, distant galaxies, Wheeler said, 'Who knew this little guy had a black hole?' The black hole was seen 'choking' on the star located three billion light years away because its enormous gravity is pulling down hard on one side of stellar body. Pictured is an artist's impression of a black hole .","The black hole tried to eat a star located three billion light years away .

"One trio of amphibians were more than happy to pose for the camera - with one grinning widely for its close up. But a fellow frog didn't look too happy when a butterfly disturbed his peaceful moment on a tree branch. The three Reinwardt's Flying Frogs, commonly known as the black webbed tree frog or the green flying frog, were spotted playing in a tree by photographer Hendy Mp. The 25-year-old, who saw the frogs near his home in Sambas, Kalimantan Barat, in Indonesia, said they reminded him of three brothers playing together. Living up to their name: Three Reinwardt's Flying Frogs, commonly known as the black webbed tree frog or the green flying frog, were spotted playing in a tree by photographer Hendy Mp . Say cheese: The trio, pictured in Kalimantan Barat, in Indonesia, were happy to pose for the camera, with one offering up a big grin . He said: 'They were playing and kept moving around every couple of minutes - climbing on each other and changing positions. 'They reminded me of three playful brothers and the one frog that looks like he is smiling I thought was very cute.' He added: 'I stayed there for about two hours taking pictures. 'They moved very quickly and elegantly - it reminded me of a dancer, they had the same sort of style in their movements.' The Reinwardt's Flying Frog, native to Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, is classed as a near threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Branching out: These frogs clearly have personality as they posed like pros. 'They reminded me of three playful brothers and the one frog that looks like he is smiling I thought was very cute,' said the photographer . Photographer's dream: Mr Mp said the frogs 'kept moving around every couple of minutes, climbing on each other and changing positions' Leap frog, anyone? The three moved quickly and elegantly and reminded the photographer of dancer, who said he stayed for two hours . Hang on: The frogs, native to Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, change their position and expressions yet again . Meanwhile, in Palangkaraya, Indonesia, photographer Muhammad Berkati spotted a butterfly sat atop a green tree frog's head whilst walking through a meadow. The 30-year-old, of Kelua, South Kalimantan, said: 'I was ecstatic that I got to witness this phenomenon, as it is very rare and not something you'd see every day. 'I woke up early on this particular day to go on a morning walk through a meadow when I spotted the special moment.' He added: 'The frog didn't seem to react at all, it just kept quiet and let the butterfly move around and get into a comfortable position on its head, and then they just sat there together.' Mr Berkati watched as the butterfly perched on the head of the frog for around three minutes, before flying away. Line-up: This time, the frogs form an orderly queue on the branch. They are classed as a near threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . Go away: The frogs turn their back on the 25-year-old photographer, who spotted them near his home in Sambas, Kalimantan Barat . Green and yellow: They can be either light green or dark green in colour and they have black spots around their backs and heads . The blue pansy butterfly was lucky to leave in one piece as the diet of a green tree frog, otherwise known as a dumpy frog, consists mainly of insects and spiders. This breed of frog has also been known to eat smaller frogs and even small mammals. A green tree frog can grow up to 10cm in length, and is native to northern and eastern regions of Australia and to southern New Guinea . Mr Berkati added: 'When people see these photographs they usually laugh, I've had a few comments from people saying the frog looks like it's wearing a little bow. 'I was originally only out looking to photograph frogs, but to my surprise the little butterfly hopped on this unsuspecting frog. 'I let the butterfly move freely, and the frog did not seem bothered by the presence of butterfly at all.' Meanwhile, in Palangkaraya, Indonesia, Muhammad Berkati spotted the moment a brave butterfly sat atop a green tree frog's head .

"A man has been arrested in connection with the murder of a woman who was reported missing nearly 24 years ago. Loyd Groves, 65, of Beaver County, Pennsylvania, was taken into custody on Thursday for the murder of his co-worker Katherine Heckel. The pair allegedly had an affair in 1991 and were seen arguing shortly before she vanished. Loyd Groves, 65, of Beaver County, Pennsylvania, was taken into custody on Thursday for the murder of his co-worker Katherine Heckel . The pair allegedly had an affair in 1991 and were seen arguing shortly before she vanished. He now faces charges of first and third-degree murder . Katherine Heckel was 40-years-old when she disappeared in July of 1991, but her body has never been found . Groves now faces charges of first and third-degree murder. Investigators recently reopened the homicide investigation in attempt to solve Heckel’s murder and brought it before a grand jury. Heckel was 40-years-old when she disappeared in July of 1991. But her body has never been found. A day after  she went missing, her family reported that she hadn’t returned home from work at international paper company in Lock Haven, according to WNEP-TV. State police searched for her in the woods of Clinton County and found evidence of foul play. They also found her car in a hospital parking lot. Yet, although Heckel’s body has not been located, a grand jury recently recommended murder charges against  Groves. Heckel and Groves were coworkers at International Paper and had a brief romantic relationship during the summer of 1991, the grand jury heard. Pennsylvania State police found her car in a hospital parking lot which suggested evidence of foul play . Pennsylvania State police searched for her in the woods of Clinton County and found more evidence of foul play . Prosecutors say Groves killed Heckel after she told him she wanted to end their relationship and co-workers remember them fighting at work hours before she disappeared. Groves then allegedly  disposed of her body so that it would never be found. He is currently being held without bail. Attorney General Kathleen Kane says she hopes Groves' arrest brings relief to Heckel's loved ones after years of uncertainty over her strange disappearance.","Loyd Groves, 65,  was arrested for the murder of Katherine Heckel in 1991 .

"A Minnesota woman has pleaded guilty to killing her fiance by tying him to an SUV and dragging him along a country road until he died. Jessica Kilde, 33, will be sentenced for second-degree intentional murder in Becker County March 16. Prosecutors say the mother of one from Ogema lashed Richard Baity, 41, to the vehicle using a strap around his neck last August and dragged him down the driveway and onto the road. Guilty: Jessica Kilde, 33, of Minnesota, will be sentenced for second-degree intentional murder in the August killing of 41-year-old Richard Baity . Confession: Kilde (left) has pleaded guilty to killing her fiance (right) by tying him to an SUV and dragging him along a country road until he died . His body was found about 50 yards from his driveway in Maple Grove Township. A criminal complaint says Kilde told authorities she and Baity had a disagreement that night, but that it was nothing serious. Authorities say the two had been drinking and smoking methamphetamine earlier in the day. According to prosecutors, at around 10.30pm on August 15, sheriff's deputies responded to a 911 call about a possible fatality and came upon Richard Baity's lifeless body along East 370th Street in Maple Grove Township, reported the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Evidence at the crime scene suggested that the 41-year-old man had been dragged: there were fresh marks on his neck and a broken strap was lying nearby. Jessica Kilde was then seen behind the wheel of a Ford Sport Trac SUV, which still had a piece of a strap tied to the top of the door frame on the rear passenger side that matched the strap found near Baity's body. An autopsy report by the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s Office stated that Baity died of ‘multiple traumatic injuries’ and ruled the death a homicide. Police said Kilde and Baity had been drinking and smoking methamphetamine before the fatal incident . Kilde, who according to her Facebook page at one time worked as a personal care assistant, had been engaged to Baity and the two were supposed to get married less than three weeks before his death. The 33-year-old's Facebook wall is filled with posts expressing her love for her husband-to-be. In December, months after Baity's death, his brother Kevin wrote an angry comment on Kilde’s social media page in reaction to an old post announcing their upcoming nuptials. ‘What she did not say is she is going to KILL him,’ Kevin Baity wrote. According to Detroit Lakes Online, Kilde has a long criminal history, which includes a dozen prior arrests on charges ranging from check forgery and domestic assault to DWI and car theft.","Jessica Kilde, 33, of Minnesota, will be sentenced for second-degree intentional murder in the August killing of 41-year-old Richard Baity .

"The record profits driven by huge iPhone 6 sales have fed a £120billion cash pile, but like fellow giants Amazon, Google and eBay, Apple faces accusations over its tax bills in the U.S. Record profits, driven by the phenomenal sale of the latest iPhone 6, saw Apple amass the cash pile which is larger than the total market value of Disney, Pepsi or Amazon. The news has reignited anger about the activities of Apple and other multi-national companies which stand accused of using complex schemes to minimise their tax bills. Scroll down for video . Record: The record profits driven by huge iPhone 6 sales have fed a £120billion cash pile, but like fellow giants Amazon, Google and eBay, Apple faces accusations over its tax bills in the U.S. The hugely wealthy company has faced allegations in the United States that it has been able to avoid paying its fair share of tax to any government in the world for at least five years. Similar charges have been made against other American tech giants including Amazon, Google, Facebook and eBay. Apple yesterday revealed that its profits for just the past three months of 2014 were $18billion (£11.9billion). That figure put it ahead of the record set by the multi-national oil giant ExxonMobil in 2012, which was being carried along on the tide of a surge in global oil prices at the time. In Apple’s case, its success has been built on sales of latest iPhone 6 and 6plus, which has a larger screen. Staggered: Apple's chief executive Tim Cook and his staff can hardly believe their own success . It sold a record 74.5 million iPhones in the three months before Christmas, which drove the company’s revenues up by 30 per cent to $74.6 billion (£49.2 billion). Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook, said they were ‘staggered’ by the success of the iPhone 6, which had achieved far higher sales than it or City experts had expected. The net effect is that Apple, which is the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalisation of $650 billion (£428.5 billion) has so much money that it does not know what to do with it. The company uses a network of companies around the world, including an off-shoot in Ireland, to minimise its tax bill in the U.S. and the many countries in which it sells its devices. The European Commission is so concerned that it has launched an investigation into a deal between Apple and the Irish government that ran from 1991-2007, which effectively allowed the U.S. giant to shrink its tax bill. If the inquiry finds the arrangement amounted to ‘illegal state aid’, Apple could be required to hand over billions to make up for the tax shortfall. The huge popularity of Apple’s products and its alleged manipulation of the tax system to its legal limits means it has been able to amass a huge cash fund, estimated at $178 billion (£120bn). If added together, the combined value of Tesco, Barclays and Vodafone only just surpass that of Apple’s cash reserves. The cash mountain alone is equivalent to the entire annual economic output of oil-rich Kuwait and around three times more than countries such as Croatia, Uruguay and Bulgaria. Mr Cook and his executives are apparently reluctant to return the cash to the parent company in the United States where it would be hit with a corporate tax rate of 35 per cent. Consequently, Apple has been reduced to borrowing against this huge fund to raise cash to buy back shares in the company from shareholders at a premium price. Murray Worthy, tax campaign manager for the charity ActionAid, said it was time for the tech giant to come clean on its finances and tax payments. Global: Customers this week in the first Apple store to open in the capital of China's Zhejiang Province . ‘The announcement by Apple today of the biggest profits in history is only part of the story. Despite this news, corporate secrecy means we still don’t know whether they’re paying a fair share of tax,’ he told Channel 4 News. The Apple chief executive has rejected allegations of financial chicanery. Mr Cook told a US Senate committee in 2013: ‘We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. ‘We not only comply with the laws, but we comply with the spirit of the laws. We don’t depend on tax gimmicks. We don’t stash money on some Caribbean island.’ Announcing the profit bonanza yesterday, Mr Cook said: ‘We’d like to thank our customers for an incredible quarter, which saw demand for Apple products soar to an all-time high.’ Apple has been doing particularly well among the burgeoning middle classes in China, where it is now the country’s number one smartphone brand. Research firm Canalys estimates that Apple sold more smartphones in China during the last quarter than any other country, including America. The success of the iPhone 6 and 6 plus, which were launched last autumn, have to some extent cannibalised sales of its other devices. As a result, sales of iPads were down by 22 per cent to 21.4 million. Devoted: Customers queued for the iPhone six outside stores all over the world, including this one in Sydney . Some experts have suggested that the launch of the new iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 and the lowering of the original iPad mini price to under £200 could see a return to growth for the Apple tablet. At the same time, the company is pinning expectations on the launch of its Apple Watch, which is due to go on sale in April. The watch carries a raft of sensors which means it is as much an electronic health centre and automated fitness guru as an accessory to its smartphone. Tech industry analysts an investment bank JP Morgan suggested Apple is sitting on a raft of new gadgets that are expected to give even more fizz to its stellar sales. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: ‘One of the main drivers for the success was the company’s increasing exposure to the Chinese market, while there were also strong contributions from Singapore and Brazil.’ Figures that'll make you dizzy . 12bn . is the profit Apple made in the past three months of 2014 — that’s £129,347,826 every day, or £5,389,492 every hour, or nearly £1,500 per second. 18 seconds . is the time it takes Apple to earn the average annual wage of a full-time UK worker: £26,500. 8.5 years . is how long it would take for Tesco (which made £1.4 billion profit last year) to make as much as Apple made in just three months, mainly thanks to the iPhone 6. 600m . iPhones sold since the smartphone’s launch in 2007. 36% of all the iPhones sold in the last quarter were bought in China — 24 per cent in the U.S. 1bn . devices that run the Apple iOS operating system — including iPhones, iPad tablet computers and iPods — were sold over the past seven years.

"Budget: Sally Shephard, pictured, bought a week's worth of fresh food for just £5.60, or 80p-a-day . A 29-year-old woman proved you don't need to break the bank to eat healthily - buying a week's worth of fresh food for just £5.60. Sally Shephard carefully planned her 80p-a-day menu and raided markets and supermarkets for the best deals on fresh ingredients. And she even had change spare for a pork pie at the end of the week. Miss Shephard, from Newcastle, said her aim was to live on the same budget as those who live below the international poverty line and raise money for impoverished communities in Kenya. Her three meals-a-day diet consisted of core ingredients such as carrots, onions and rice that were bought at the beginning of the week. And rather than indulging in costly alcohol or fizzy drinks, Miss Shephard washed her meals down with glasses of hot water. She said the meals, which included omelettes, potato cakes and soups, weren't that different to what she would usually eat, and said it proved it was always possible to eat healthily - even on a shoestring budget. Miss Shephard, who is due to become a special needs worker next month, said:  'I bulk bought bags of potatoes and rice and bought fresh fruit and vegetables from my local market. 'I was never hungry and I had loads of money left even after I'd bought myself the ingredients. 'My diet during those seven days wasn't that different to what I would have normally and I had good, big healthy meals.' On day four of the challenge, Miss Shephard used the £2.24 she had in change from her main buy at the beginning of the week to pick up spinach, a cabbage and six eggs from the market. And on day seven, Miss Shephard even had enough money to buy a pork pie that had been reduced to 45p. She finished the week with five potatoes, five onions, more than half a kilo of rice, a slice of bread, two thirds of the cabbage and some butter - and  still had 9p in her purse. Day one . Breakfast - wholemeal toast with butter and a banana . Lunch - rice salad with onion and carrot . Dinner - carrot, potato and onion soup . Day two . Breakfast - wholemeal toast with butter and a banana . Lunch - carrot, potato and onion soup . Dinner - rice salad with onion and carrot and mushrooms gathered on a walk . Day three . Breakfast - two slices of wholemeal toast with butter, and a banana . Lunch - carrot, potato and onion soup . Dinner - carrot, potato and onion soup with slice of fried bread (fried in butter) Staple: Miss Shephard's carrot potato and onion soup, pictured, was a key part of her five-day menu. She bought all three vegetables in bulk for little over £2 at the beginning of the week . Day four . Breakfast - wholemeal toast with butter and a banana . Lunch - plain jacket potato . Dinner - omelette packed with onion, spinach and cabbage and a slice of fried bread . Day five . Breakfast - wholemeal toast with butter and a banana . Lunch - carrot, potato and onion soup . Dinner - potato cakes with onion and carrot and a poached egg . Day six . Brunch - two slices of toast, two potato cakes and a poached egg . Dinner - potato cakes with steamed cabbage, carrots and spinach . Supper - piece of toast with a potato cake . Day seven . Breakfast - two slices of toast, two potato cakes and a potato cake . Lunch - pork pie . Dinner - steamed cabbage, spinach and carrots bubble and squeak . Dinner: Miss Shephard made potato cakes (left) with onion and carrot and a poached egg for her evening meal on day five. Her meals were made from ingredients sourced from markets and supermarkets . Treat: At the end of the week Miss Shephard even had enough money to buy a pork pie that had been reduced to 45p, pictured, and still had 9p in her purse leftover . Miss Shephard said the challenge showed it is possible to live comfortably on low-cost ingredients, adding that there was 'no excuse' to eat unhealthy food as it is 'often so expensive in comparison'. While she admitted the menu did become slightly repetitive, she said the meals were also surprisingly tasty. 5kg potatoes: £1 . 10kg onions: £1 . Bag of carrots: 49p . Wholemeal bread: 49p . 1kg rice: 40p . Five bruised bananas: 5p . Butter: £1 . Spinach: 50p . Cabbage: 50p . Eggs: 70p . Pork Pie: 45p . She said: 'The potato cakes are a winner. I will be making them much more in the future. 'It has been a little repetitive but easily manageable and enjoyable. I have also surprised myself with how many tasty meals can be made with so few ingredients. 'I didn't have any fatty foods or anything processed at all. If anything my diet is much healthier as I have not been able to afford crisps, chocolate and alcohol.' The challenge, which lasted a week, has already helped Miss Shephard raise more than £1,000 for Mattumaini, a charity she set up. The project is dedicated to the development of the community in the slums of Nakuru, the fourth largest town in Kenya. Miss Shephard said: 'All you read about in the news is the Government giving money to people who are obese to help them lose weight. 'I don't think that's right and I've got a friend who lives below the poverty line so I thought I would try and prove you don't need a lot of money to live healthily. I found it surprisingly easy.' Chopped: Miss Shephard said the challenge showed it is possible to live comfortably on low-cost ingredients, adding that there was 'no excuse' to eat unhealthy food as it is 'often so expensive in comparison' Weekend boost: This hearty meal of two slices of wholemeal toast, two poached eggs and two potato cakes was just one of the clever meal that Miss Shephard came up with .

"A gang of thieves used gas bombs to blow up dozens of cash machines across the country and steal £800,000. The seven men targeted cash machines across the North West and Midlands, using gas bombs to blow them open and cause hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage. They have been jailed for a total of 114 years and police are hunting for two further suspects who they believe were involved in the raids. A gang of seven men used gas bombs to blow up cash machines in the Midlands so they could steal £800,000 . The force of the explosions blew open the cash machines so the gang could pilfer the money inside them . A member of the seven strong gang is seen walking around the cash machine (centre) to get to the money . The man reaches the exploded cash machine and can access all the cash inside, during one of 28 raids . As they targeted cash machines the gang even accidentally blew up £20,000 in the process and could easily have harmed people nearby. The group targeted 28 cash machines at banks, post offices and supermarkets in Wirral, Lancashire, Cheshire, Southport, Liverpool, Prescot, Loughborough, Gloucester, Birmingham, Northampton and Derby. Around £800,000 was stolen and the raids caused around £485,000 worth of damage to the buildings where gas bombs were used to prise open the cash machines. Their hideout was in Huyton and experts said anyone standing within 100 metres of the blasts would have been killed, the Liverpool Echo reported. Adam Murphy and Andrew White, are wanted for conspiracy to cause explosions at cash machines and burglary of bank and shop premises between January 2013 and December 2013.

"It has not been captured in a drama series since The Jewel in the Crown in the 1980s. But colonial India is returning to our television screens in the form of new period saga Indian Summers. Considered to be Channel 4’s equivalent to Downton Abbey but set in India, veteran actress Julie Walters has a starring role in the lavish £14m production - making it the most expensive drama commission in the channel’s history. Scroll down for video . Considered to be Channel 4's equivalent to Downton Abbey, veteran actress Julie Walters has a starring role in Indian Summers . Set in Simla, a Himalayan hill station, Indian Summers follows the passions and politics of the period, among both the British elite and the Indian population. The first episode of the 10 part series will air on Sunday February 15th at 9pm putting it head-to-head with Casual Vacancy, the BBC’s hotly anticipated adaptation of JK Rowling’s novel set in a fictional English town called Pagford. Speaking at a screening of episode one, series executive producer Charlie Pattinson said the money spent on Indian Summers was evidence of channel 4’s ‘extraordinary confidence’. Mr Pattinson said:' Paul (Rutman, writer) came to me, with Simon Curtis (another executive producer). 'It’s not often that someone comes to you with a fully formed, madly ambitious… they came and they pitched me 50 hours of television that would start in 1932 and would follow these characters through a massive romantic, political saga, through to independence, and in so doing describe a key piece of history. So this was entirely originally work. Indian Summers is set in 1932 - 15 years before Indian gained independence from Britain . ‘We’ve got an amazing television season this year. If you look around it most of our work is adaptations and I think that’s the extraordinary confidence of Channel 4, that they sat and they looked at an original piece of work, that’s not an adaptation, and is hugely ambitious and went this is a story that is work telling, and in a very modern way. 'The notion of a television novel, in the way that David Simon (The Wire creator) described Baltimore or whatever it would be in The Wire, is new and exciting and I think that was the ambition that Paul and Simon brought to me, and what I responded to.’ Indian Summers also stars Jemima West, who is best known for appearing in The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones and The Borgias, as well as The Inbetweeners actor Henry Lloyd Hughes, Ayesha Kala, from Shameless, and Bollywood stars Lillette Dubey and Roshan Seth.

"A former NFL player being sued by his insurance company after he took part in Survivor even though he has a disability rating says he was able to get through the show with 'pain medication'. Ex-defensive tackle Brad Culpepper received $175,000 in workers' compensation two years ago before his appearance in the reality series in 2013 alongside his wife Monica. The 46-year-old, who started his professional career with the Minnesota Vikings, told doctors he had 'low back pain and stiffness which is almost always present'. However California-based Fairmont Premier claim Culpepper, who is now a personal injury attorney, 'willfully and deceptively provided false information' to the medical professionals who examined him. Scroll down for video . Former NFL defensive tackle Brad Culpepper competed in the 2013 series of Survivor (left) despite a disability rating. The ex-Tampa Bay Buccaneers player (right) was paid $175,000 in compensation two years ago . They watched him perform a number of physically challenging tasks during the show - including lifting heavy crates, paddling canoes. According to a lawsuit seen by ABC News, the University of Florida graduate said he had 'quite a bit of difficulty... getting into or out of the bath and performing heavy activities around his home.' He then went on to describe a list of injuries from head to knee traumas as well as vision problems. However the insurance company contends that he is 'exquisitely fit and conditioned' and 'not disabled'. He told the station: 'I was on pain medication, and I had a back procedure right before that. 'Just because I chose to do things that are contra [sic] to my body, doesn't mean I'm not in pain, and doesn't mean I'm not impaired.' Culpepper played nine seasons in the NFL after graduating from the University of Florida. He was picked in the 10th round in the 1992 and would become a regular starter for the Vikings, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Chicago Bears. Following his retirement he became an injury lawyer in Tampa Bay, Florida, and has slammed the case against him as 'ludicrous'. Allegations: The insurance company claim Culpepper (pictured during the 2013 series), who is now an injury attorney, 'willfully and deceptively provided false information' to the medical professionals who examined him . Anger: During a TV interview, which is set to be broadcast on Monday evening, Culpepper ripped off his shirt in frustration and showed the camera his torn bicep before asking: 'Is this normal?' He added: 'I've worked too hard in my life to have this as a headline.' Culpepper's frustration reached boiling point during a TV interview with ABC's Brian Ross, which will be aired on Thursday night. He ripped off his shirt and showed a torn bicep and a shoulder injury to to the camera, asking: 'Is that normal?' Despite the controversy, he says he has no regrets competing in the show. He was voted off after 14 days and finished 15th. His wife was the show's runner-up. The lawsuit against Culpepper was filed in Orange County, California, in July. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Fairmont contended he was feigning injury while taking part in highly-publicized athletic competitions. It read: 'Defendant Culpepper's conduct was fraudulent, deceptive and designed to inflate the value of his claim and to take advantage of and abuse the California workers' compensation system.' The claim added that following his retirement he had taken up mixed martial arts, but failed to tell doctors about the new hobby. In response, Culpepper's attorney Scott Schutzman called the insurance company attorneys' version of events an 'exaggeration.' Challenge: Culpepper (pictured second from front in the boat) completed a number of arduous tasks during the 2013 reality series - including paddling a canoe and lifting heavy crates .

"Emily Colbourne drove her children to school while over the drink drive limit, and has been banned from the road - after her husband reported her to police . A woman who drove her children to school while over the drink drive limit has been banned from the road - after her husband reported her to police. Emily Colbourne, 33, got into an argument with her husband Stuart when she returned home from the pub in Henfield, West Sussex, later than expected. The mother-of-four fell asleep, but when she woke up the next day  the couple - who are still together - continued to argue. Worthing Magistrates' Court heard that her husband took their two youngest children – both under three years of age – to nursery. Meanwhile his wife took the two eldest children to school in Upper Beeding. Martina Sherlock, defending, said Colbourne was eager to get her children to school and out of the frosty atmosphere at home. But once she had left the house to take the children - aged eight and 11 - to school, police received the phone call claiming she was over the drink drive limit. Colbourne was spotted coming out of a shop and getting into her car before driving. The court was told that she had already dropped the children  at their school. She was pulled over by a firearms team in the area and arrested. After being taken into police custody, it was found that Colbourne was one and half times over the drink drive limit. She gave a reading of 57/100, exceeding the legal limit to drive of 35. Ms Sherlock said: 'She would never put her children at risk. She would never do that. After being taken into police custody, Ms Colbourne blew 57/100, exceeding the legal limit to drive of 35 . 'She was anxious to make sure her children got to school despite the tensions going on at home.' She also asked why her husband had not stopped her from driving if he knew she was over the limit, instead of informing the police. Colbourne, of Henfield, West Sussex, was banned from driving for 36 months. She was also fined £110 and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £20. When asked by magistrates whether she could pay any of the fine, Ms Colbourne said: 'I don't have any credit cards or anything. I'm bankrupt.' The court was told the fines would come out of the combined income of the couple, who are still together. Colbourne, of Henfield, West Sussex, was banned from driving for 36 months. She was also fined £110 and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £20 at Worthing Magistrates' Court . The Express reports that Colbourne was the first person to be charged by Sussex Police in its Christmas drink-driving crackdown. At the time, Colbourne said: 'I, like many other people, truly believed I was legally allowed and safe to drive. 'I really hope others realise that it is not enough to rely on a night's sleep and breakfast to be under the legal drink-drive limit. 'My mistake has caused enough upset for our family to cope and deal with. 'I am in no way condoning driving over the limit or making excuses but, if my actions save another parent or person making the same mistake at least some good will have come out of it.'","Emily Colbourne argued with husband when she came home from the pub .

"Menace: Justin Carley poses on a social networking site . A boy of 12 who terrorised a neighbourhood with his appalling behaviour bragged he was being hauled to court for ‘anty soshal behavuare’. Justin Carley destroyed the lives of residents by abusing and threatening them in the street, hurling dog dirt, kicking his football against parked cars, and throwing stones at windows. He even cycled through a library and threatened to smash all of its windows. The tearaway has been given a final warning and handed a two-year Asbo. But even then he tried to put two fingers up at authority by taking to social media. He boasted to friends of his impending court case on Facebook saying: ‘In court Wednesday for asbo ffs [for f****’* sake]. anty soshal behavuare.’ Before he was sentenced at Stockport magistrates’ court he posted another message complaining about the slow court procedure, saying: ‘cba [can’t be a***d] with this court came 9.45 still waiting and its 2.00.’ Afterwards he wrote in a further garbled outburst that he was unsure whether he would be able to stick to the two-year Asbo. Neighbours say the boy, who lives with his mother, Jackie, 30, and an older sister in a three-bedroom terrace property in Brinnington, Stockport, is ‘out of control’ and has also been in trouble at school. Last month his mother, who is single, wrote on Facebook: ‘P***** off with my sons school …every day theres a f****** problem with him if thay cant cope with him tell me and il find a school that can. ‘My son walked out off school and nobody can find him and thay leave it until 2pm to tell thay never know where he is most time.’ Neighbours spoke of their relief that action had been taken against the yob. Justin Carley, 12, was given an ASBO after he repeatedly ignored warnings about his bad behaviour in Stockport. He complained about having to go to court for more 'anty-soshal behavuare' on Facebook . One woman, who was too scared to be named, said: ‘That boy has turned a very pleasant housing estate into a war zone. Roger Phillips, chairman of Stockport Homes' board said they were committed to putting stop to bad behaviour that affects residents in the area . ‘His behaviour was insane. He had no respect for anyone, young or old, and basically ran riot.’ A pensioner added: ‘People’s lives were turned into a nightmare. He is out of control. Everyone round here is sick and tired of his mother making excuses for him. ‘I’m afraid there is simply no one to discipline him and he’s been in a lot of trouble at school as well.’ The yob has been warned that one more step out of line and he could face five years in a young offenders’ institution. He was warned six times by housing association bosses about his behaviour before being taken to court. No legal restrictions were put in place on identifying Carley, whose name was also revealed by the housing association, Stockport Homes. During the period of the Asbo, Carley must not act in an anti-social manner likely to cause harassment alarm or distress to anyone.","Justin Carley has been warned about his bad behaviour in Stockport .

"As the centrepiece of one of Britain's great museums, it has inspired visitors for more than a century. But the Natural History Museum's famous model of a diplodocus, known affectionately to schoolchildren as Dippy, is to be retired after 110 years. Bosses at the London institution have decided the 83ft long exhibit is no longer relevant enough to take pride of place in their great entrance hall. Scroll down for video . Dippy: The Diplodocus skeleton in the main central hall of the Natural History Museum . They are to replace it with a skeleton of a giant blue whale, as a reminder of 'our responsibility to the planet'. The change is part of a 'decade of transformation' planned at the museum by its director, Sir Michael Dixon. The diplodocus exhibit, first unveiled in 1905, is a model made up of 356 plaster cast bones. But from summer 2017, Dippy will be replaced by the 83ft long real skeleton of a blue whale, suspended in a diving motion from the ceiling of the central Hintze Hall. Symbol of hope: The whale, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, and a resident of the museum since 1891, will be suspended in a diving motion from the ceiling of the central Hintze Hall . An artist's impression of how the Blue Skeleton will look.  The vast skeleton of a blue whale is to welcome visitors as the central display in the Natural History Museum's Hintze Hall from summer 2017 . Natural History Museum artist's impression of how the skeleton of a blue whale will look suspended and 'diving' from the ceiling of the Hintze Hall . The whale, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, and a resident of the museum since 1891, is a symbol of environmental destruction and hope . This sperm whale skeleton stood in the Central Hall between 1882 and 1901. The whale was found near Thurso, Scotland, in 1863, and two years later its skeleton was presented to the Museum by Captain D. Macdonald . Photographed in 1910 just three years after his arrival, the African elephant later nicknamed George, was obtained from the taxidermists Rowland Ward Ltd . The hall photographed in 1895. The Natural History Museum was designed by Alfred Waterhouse (1830-1905) and opened to the public on Easter Monday 1881 . The Natural History Museum (pictured in 1882) welcomes more than five million visitors a year.It also operates as a world-leading research centre . The whale, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, and a resident of the museum since 1891, is a symbol of environmental destruction and hope, Sir Michael said. The Natural History Museum holds over 80million specimens, including mammoth skeletons and items from the voyages of Charles Darwin and Captain James Cook. The museum has a moon rock brought back from the Apollo 17 mission, the only piece in the UK. It keeps a 900-strong colony of tiny flesh-eating beetles, which it uses to strip carcasses down to skeletons for study or display. The most valued fossil in the museum's collection is the archaeopteryx, or the 'first bird', which is 150million years old. The biggest animal ever to have lived on Earth at 160 tonnes, it was hunted to near extinction for its oil, meat and body parts. It is still endangered but its population has recovered ten-fold after being granted protected status in 1967. Sir Michael said: 'The story of the blue whale reminds us of the scale of our responsibility to the planet. Our purpose is to challenge the way people think about the natural world, and that goal has never been more urgent.' Dippy, however, won't be left in pieces in a dusty cupboard. There are plans to send the model on a tour of the UK. 'Dippy's an icon of the museum but the new exhibit will allow us to tell a range of stories,' Sir Michael said. The museum recently unveiled a stegosaurus exhibit which, unlike the diplodocus, is made of real fossils. Sophie the stegosaurus is the most complete dinosaur to go on display at the museum for over a century, and the most complete stegosaurus specimen in the world. Dippy was unveiled at a special ceremony at the museum at 1pm on May 12 1905. He was donated to the Museum by Scottish-born American millionaire and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie after King Edward VII saw an illustration of the original skeleton and asked for a copy .","Natural History Museum's famous model of a diplodocus is to be retired after 110 years as children's favourite .

"Schoolgirl sex gangs in China are being hired to blackmail youngster classmates into selling their virginities to government officials, it has been reported. Tycoons are increasingly striking deals to arrange sexual favours for corrupt Party bosses in the country, it has been claimed. In one case, a ‘tribunal’ of adolescent girls at a school in the Shanxi province ordered younger victims to strip and hit each other while their clothes were sliced off with blades, according to reports. Schoolgirl sex gangs in China are being hired to blackmail youngster classmates into selling their virginities to government officials, it has been reported (file picture) A separate case in Henan saw dozens of schoolgirls pictured naked at a nightclub with the images used to force sex with local officials and as a way of bringing in fresh recruits. Chinese media outlets claim that in many cases powerful individuals are organising the criminal activity in a bid to win business opportunities. According to Globalpost, claims of schoolgirls being sexually exploited in this way have become ‘shockingly common’. It reports that victims are often taken to karaoke bars or hotels by older girls who are already linked to tycoons. Late last year, the website says, it was reported that investigations had started into a ring involving ‘dozens’ of schoolgirls in Yunnan ‘given as gifts for leaders outside the county to use’. Chinese media claim that in many cases powerful individuals organise the criminal activity in a bid to win business opportunities . Girls were said to have been bribed by a female intermediary before being plied with booze. Some victims later claimed they had been drugged and raped. In the Hainan province, the head teacher at one school was accused of being involved in a ‘drug induced session’ with six students and a local official, Globalpost reports. And up to 50 youngsters were targeted in a separate case in Yunnan’s capital Kunming. Arrests are since said to have been made in the Henan case but question marks surround the convictions amid reports a number of junior officials involved only received suspended sentences. Parents of victims in the Shanxi case claimed abusers had threatened to expose naked pictures of their children as part of an unsuccessful bid to sell their virginities, the report says. It quotes sources who told Legal Weekly that some virgins would fetch 5,000 yuan (£528) while some of the teenage recruiters had amassed sums of nearly £130,000. In this case, the headmaster of the school involved is said to have declined responsibility ‘other than mediating a settlement’, the Globalpost reports. But police have been quoted as saying that they have not found evidence of public officials being involved in prostitution – despite ‘repeated investigations’.","Schoolgirls told by older students to strip and hit each other, it is claimed .

"Labour MP Sarah Champion, who represents the South Yorkshire town, said she now thinks the figures in the Jay Report may be an underestimate . Victims of the Rotherham child abuse scandal may number as many as 2,000 - hundreds more than were identified in a damning report - the town's MP said today. The report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed how some 1,400 vulnerable girls had been subjected to rape, violence and trafficking by gangs of mainly Asian men in the town between 1997 and 2013. But today, Labour MP Sarah Champion, who represents the South Yorkshire town, said she now thinks the figures in the Jay Report may be an underestimate. Ms Champion told a Sky News investigation that she has new victims coming to her on a 'weekly basis'. 'I would say it's closer to a couple of thousand people who have been groomed or have been sexually exploited in this little town,' she said. Her claim was supported by the Risky Business community project in Rotherham, the investigation claimed, which said it identified 1,700 victims between 1999 and 2011. Risky Business was one of the few organisations praised by the report, but it was largely ignored and even harassed. It was later shut down. In her first interview, Risky Business's former manager Jayne Senior told Sky News: 'I was accused of saying too much, sharing too much information, reporting too much intelligence. 'Risky Business didn't make all this up. It was accused of making it all up, and Alexis Jay exonerated all of that, but we didn't just get up and think: ""What shall we do today? Let's make up that..."" The Jay report provoked shock and controversy when it was published last summer. It revealed the sexual exploitation of young girls and said police and council officials had betrayed the victims by not tackling the problem. The programme also talked to a victim - identified as 'Gemma' - who said her abusers are still driving around Rotherham's streets. She said: 'I'm still seeing my abusers, driving young girls in the car. 'They're untouchable. Six months on we've had no arrests, no charges, evidence is still being lost. They're just giving them - 'do what you want'.' Asked about what happened to Risky Business, Gemma said: 'I think it was shut down because they were trying to tackle the problem.' She said this amounted to a cover-up. The report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed how some 1,400 vulnerable girls had been subjected to rape, violence and trafficking by gangs of mainly Asian men in Rotherham, pictured, between 1997 and 2013 . The programme also talked to a victim, identified as 'Gemma', pictured left in shadow, who said her abusers are still driving around Rotherham's streets . The controversy that followed the publication of the Jay Report led to a series of high-profile resignations including Rotherham council leader Roger Stone, council chief executive Martin Kimber and council director of children's services Joyce Thacker. The most high profile resignation was that of South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright, who was the Rotherham councillor overseeing children's services between 2005 and 2010. South Yorkshire's chief constable David Crompton has also been under pressure to explain his force's attitude towards child sex exploitation over the last 15 years. The National Crime Agency has taken over the investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham and is in the preliminary stage of its inquiry. Quit: The most high profile resignation was that of South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright, pictured . The controversy that followed the publication of the Jay Report report in August 2014 led to a series of high-profile resignations. Senior figures to quit included Labour council leader Roger Stone, council chief executive Martin Kimber and council director of children's services Joyce Thacker. The most high profile resignation was that of South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright, who was the Rotherham councillor overseeing children's services between 2005 and 2010. After the scandal broke, Mr Wright defied demands from political leaders of all parties to resign for weeks and refused to see why he should take any blame. He finally stepped down in September, claiming he was leaving ‘for the sake of the victims’. It later emerged Mr Wright will not get a severance pay-off, but will keep his local authority pension, which he can claim from the age of 55. Mr Wright had faced demands to quit since the report revealed that the authorities had repeatedly ignored warnings about the abuse of children  in Rotherham over 16 years. Meanwhile, shamed former Rotherham children's services boss Joyce Thacker received a £40,000 payoff after quitting her £130,000-a-year in September. The details of the payoff, revealed after a Freedom of Information request last October, came as Mrs Thacker was singled out for criticism in a report published  into the town's child sex abuse scandal. The Home Affairs Select Committee report said she ignored 'numerous credible warnings' about the scale of abuse, and called for an independent investigation. There was widespread public outrage when council boss Martin Kimber received £26,000 to leave his job early in December. Martin Kimber issue a ‘sincere apology to those who were let down’ when he resigned from Rotherham Council and promised he would not receive any ‘compensation’ for his decision to quit his £160,000 a year post. Mr Kimber was originally intending to work his three months notice until the end of the year, but left his post on 31 October instead, to allow the new chief executive to get on with the job. As a result the local authority paid him £26,666 - the salary he would have received had he worked the final two months. South Yorkshire's chief constable David Crompton has also been under pressure to explain his force's attitude towards child sex exploitation over the last 15 years.","Report revealed 1,400 girls had been sexually exploited between 1997-2013 .

"The parents of an eight-year-old boy thought he was suffering from 'growing pains' when he was actually dying of scurvy, an inquest has heard. Dylan Seabridge collapsed  at the family home in the remote village of Eglwyswrw in Pembrokeshire, west Wales in December 2011. After his death it emerged he had the rare condition - almost unheard of in modern-day Britain - which is caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. Glynn and Julie Seabridge thought their son Dylan was suffering from growing pains before he died of scurvy . His parents Glynn, 47, and Julie had not sought medical advice for the youngster because they thought he was  suffering from 'growing pains', it emerged today. Former teacher Mrs Seabridge, 46, and her husband were both unemployed and home schooling their son at the time of his death. She had taught IT in a secondary school until 2009, when she left her post due to ill health. An inquest in Milford Haven heard how Mr Seabridge called 999 on 6 December 2011 after the boy's health deteriorated. Paramedics who attended the family home found Dylan unconscious and not breathing with bruising to his ankle and knee as well as swollen legs. He was rushed to hospital but suffered a heart attack and doctors were unable to save him. The parents rejected a Home Office pathologist's conclusion that the rare condition - caused by lack of vitamin C - was to blame, but a coroner has today found scurvy killed Dylan . Home Office pathologist Dr Deryck Simon Jones, who carried out the post mortem examination, concluded that Dylan's death was due to scurvy. Scurvy was at one time common among sailors deprived of fresh fruit and vegetables while at sea but is now incredibly rare. Symptoms of scurvy are lethargy, spots on the skin, spongy gums and bleeding from the nose. Treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that is high in the essential vitamin such as cabbage, grapefruit, sweet potatoes, lemons, broccoli, limes and tomatoes. NHS guidance says the condition should be treated quickly to reverse its harmful effects. The parents, who were not present at today's hearing, reject this finding. Their lawyer, Katie Hanson, told the inquest: 'The parents don't accept that Dylan died of scurvy.' A specialist from Belgium, Professor Joris Dlanghe, also questioned whether Dylan had scurvy claiming that other deficiencies such as folic acid would have been present too but were not. Dylan's parents had given their son painkillers for his 'growing pains' shortly before his death. They were intially arrested and charged with neglect but the Crown Prosecution Service later dropped their case against them. Pembrokeshire Coroner, Mark Layton, ruled that Dylan had died from scurvy and recorded an open conclusion.","Youngster was being home schooled by parents in remote Welsh village .

Sherri Norman was driving in Randleman, North Carolina when she claims another woman, who was speeding, tried repeatedly to pass her, ultimately succeeding. It did not end there however, as video shows the woman repeatedly stopping short to get Norman's car to slam into her own vehicle, veering off the road to try and side slam her car, and then ultimately stopping and getting out to begin punching Hastings through an open window on the driver's side of the vehicle. Scroll down for video . A woman was filmed flipping off another driver in a road rage incident on Saturday . She then ran up to the woman's car, while the driver's daughter was in the backseat . The woman began trying to puncht he driver through her car window . This as the woman's daughter Destiny can be heard screaming out of fear and crying in the backseat. That woman, 40-year-old Kristin Leigh Phillips, has now been charged with reckless driving to endanger, assault and battery, injury to personal property, driving left of center and two counts of communicating threats according to Fox 8. 'I knew what was going to happen. I wanted it on tape. Twice the lady tried to pass me on a two-lane road with double lines on a hill,' said Norman. Only after the woman managed to role her window up did the other woman return to her car . 'She about ran me off road first time. She got behind me a second time and then went to go around again. I let her have the road, called 911, reported her and her plate number… I started phone video which was in a holder on dashboard — hands free.' She gave the video to the police on Saturday after the incident occurred and Phillips was arrested Monday.","Sherri Norman was driving in Randleman, North Carolina on Saturday when a woman tried to slam into her car and run her off the road .

"Nice-looking in a watery way, Michael Pennington, whom I used to see 40 years ago at Stratford, has always had a line in softly-spoken kings and princes. His voice a lovely, elegiac murmur, he is a particularly skilled exponent of Chekhov. So, why isn’t he better known? Perhaps an implicit theme underlying Let Me Play The Lion Too is the difference between conscientious, hardworking professionals and an acclaimed genius. How come some actors and actresses are household names while others, despite their quality and elegance, are only allowed to be considered very good, appreciated by the cognoscenti? It is so unfair, because the gulf between the great and the competent — and the rewards that come their way — is vast. Is it to do with the likes of Laurence Olivier or Ralph Richardson possessing a powerful and distinctive ego? Michael Pennington and Greta Scacchi together in 'The Guardsman', October 2000 . It can’t be because of variety and depth — otherwise Roy Dotrice or Robert Hardy would be given a Westminster Abbey memorial service when they eventually croak. Whatever the answer, one thing is for certain: stardom is ‘where the money is. That’s the reality’. Ah, money. Being an actor, according to this highly intelligent book, is a struggle, unless you are in the Dame Judi Dench or Sir Michael Gambon class. Pennington — who appeared in 30 productions during his three years at Cambridge and served his apprenticeship carrying a spear at the RSC, where the leading lights were David Warner, Eric Porter, Ian Holm and Peggy Ashcroft — after all this time still has to travel on public transport, where he goes unrecognised. For most actors, and Pennington is no different, the day is spent waiting for the phone to ring. Unless you’re David Tennant or Daniel Radcliffe, being unemployed takes up a lot of energy. ‘You try to keep up a social life,’ he says, ‘though you’d rather hibernate like a wounded animal.’ Auditions — where it is necessary to put up, uncomplainingly, with the caprices of casting directors who will switch timetables and venues at the last minute — are a regular humiliation. A theatre company is ‘an eccentric human machine’, the cast quickly forming ‘instinctive antagonisms and silent grudges’. Dressing rooms are commonly poky and decent digs eat into the wage packet. Tours play havoc with family life. Loneliness and affairs are occupational hazards. ‘It can make you feel guiltily confused,’ says Pennington, philosophically. He writes evocatively of the ‘nauseated fear’ of first nights and the melancholia of last nights when, within hours, the set is dismantled, people disperse and an entire production is ‘gone beyond recovery’. Forty years ago, the actors cost half the production budget on television. Now, the performers’ pay accounts for a mere 15 per cent. The money goes on computer effects. Though a regular on a soap can earn £100,000 a year, a guest artiste, such as Pennington, has to settle for £600 per episode before stoppages — if your agent demands more, ‘you won’t be back next year’. Pennington describes the soap studio atmosphere brilliantly. Madness seems to loom. One actor, ‘after three years as a regular’ on Holby City, fully believed himself to be a surgeon, and thought the set at Elstree was a genuine A&E. Scripts are shredded each night, because of ‘a paranoid fear of press leaks’. Feature films are more of the same, on a bigger scale. The set-ups and endless takes make for extreme tedium. The stars are kept in seclusion. ‘They certainly won’t have their name on any trailer door.’ And not for your Streeps or your De Niros any ‘evil-looking toilets and bacon rolls’. They have suites and personal caterers. All in all, Pennington paints a thoroughly bleak picture of a player’s life, whether one is ‘on the road, squatting in semi-derelict houses to play Ibsen, Cocteau and Beckett’, or being told by Martin Scorsese to be ‘louder, softer, slower, or faster’. Gone are the days of boozy carousing, which prevailed for Richard Burton, Peter O’Toole, Richard Harris, or Oliver Reed, when it was a tradition to play King Lear with a bottle of wine inside you. Is anyone better off for the sparkling water culture? Showbusiness, it seems, is still a place rife with ‘mendacity, broken promises and abandoned hope’. And just as writing and literature have been obliterated by bloggers and the illiteracies and short attention span of texting and tweeting, acting is being eclipsed by ‘reality’ television (i.e. members of the public who don’t have to be paid), or else actors have been replaced altogether with digital puppets and animation. The day of the actor may even be done.","Michael Pennington has been acting on the stage for over 40 years .

In it, he details first night fears, touring and poky dressing rooms ."
"The Republican-controlled Senate on Thursday approved a bipartisan bill to construct the Keystone XL oil pipeline, defying a presidential veto threat and setting up the first of many battles with the White House over energy and the environment. The 62-36 vote advanced a top priority of the newly empowered GOP, and marked the first time the Senate passed a bill authorizing the pipeline, despite numerous attempts to force President Barack Obama's hand on the issue. Nine Democrats joined with 53 Republicans to back the measure, which would take the decision on whether to build the pipeline out of the Oval Office. Still the vote was short of the threshold needed to override a veto, and the legislation still must be reconciled with the version the House passed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . SPRING IN HIS STEP: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said passing a bill approving the Keystone XL pipeline is a major accomplishment that will put well-deserved pressure on President Obama . BALL IN HIS COURT: The president has promised to veto the Keystone bill but is under pressure from business leaders to hold his nose and sign it . OIL SANDS: The Canadian province of Alberta is home to 35 million acres of oil-soaked sand that are the world's second largest petroleum reserve – trailing only the deposits beneath Saudi Arabia . Now Republican leaders in the House of Representatives have to determine whether they will vote on the Senate bill or launch a conference committee to hash out differences with a similar bill they passed a few weeks ago. 'I'd like to congratulate Leader McConnell for passing this bill in an open, inclusive and bipartisan way,' House Speaker John Boehner said after the vote. 'After dropping his scheme to tax middle-class college savings, we hope President Obama will now drop his threat to veto this common-sense bill that would strengthen our energy security and create thousands and thousands of new, good-paying American jobs.' Obama's State Department has put at 42,000 the number of jobs the Keystone project would create in the U.S., and declared that the environmental impact would be negligible. Boehner's jab about college savings referred to a White House plan to taxSection 529 college savings plans in order to pay for a universal guarantee of free community college tuition. The Obama administration abandoned the idea this week. Keystone, if it's built according to plan, would carry more than 1 million barrles of oil each day to refineries in the southen United States, mostly from Canada. This bill 'is an important accomplishment for the country,' said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Steam injection pipes, left, separate a heavy oil called bitumen from the earth and pipe it (center) into tanks; if the pipeline is built the oil will head south into the United States for refining . The Obama administration has focused its condemnation of the project on the contention that Canada, whose tar sands oilfields would mark the pipeline's starting point, would be the only beneficiary. But oil from several northern U.S. states would also flow through Keystone. Obama spoke in Cushing, Oklahoma in March 2012, acknowledging that America is producing 'so much oil and gas in places like North Dakota and Colorado that we don’t have enough pipeline capacity to transport all of it.' Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota, who shepherded the Keystone legislation through the Senate, complained that Obama had 'delayed this important infrastructure project for more than six years.' 'The will of the American people and Congress is clear. I encourage the president to sign this legislation and work with us,' he said. His fellow North Dakota senator, Democrat Heidi Heitkamp, was one of the nine who crossed from left to right to pass the bill. 'Supporting projects, like the Keystone pipeline that are in the best interest of our energy, economic, and national security,' she said in a statement. 'It’s imperative that we pass the Keystone pipeline, and move on so we finally talk about what the larger energy strategy for our country.' THis map shows the proposed route of TransCanada's Keystone pipeline . HEY HEY, HO HO, THAT KEYSTONE PIPELINE'S GOT TO GO: Protesters have gathered to shout slogans wherever Obama has spoken in recent months . OPTIMISTIC GOP: Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska (center) was accompanied by Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota (left) and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky (right) after the vote. Hoeven sponsored the Keystone XL pipeline bill . Most Republicans – and some Democrats – see Keystone as a jobs and infrastructure bill of the type Obama often urges them to back. 'The president has called on Congress to pass bipartisan infrastructure projects, and soon he will have the opportunity to sign one into law,' said Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn. Democrats view the Canada-to-Texas pipeline project as a potential environmental despoiler and a needless sop to fossil fuel producers . Democrats framed the bill as gift to a foreign oil company that would have little benefit for the American people, because much of the oil would be exported. They tried and failed to get amendments on the bill to construct the pipeline with U.S. steel, ban exports of the oil and the products refined from it, and protect water resources. The Senate agreed to add an energy efficiency measure, and went on the record saying climate change was not a hoax and the oil sands should be subject to a tax that helps pay for oil spill cleanups. Oil sands are currently exempt. COMPLAINING ON THE MARGINS: Democrats (L to R) Chuck Schumer of New York, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan obected to the failure of their amendments which would have put conditions on the pipeline's construction . 'This bill is a disgrace,' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, the top Democrat on the Senate environment committee. 'We tried on our side to make this a better bill and they turned us away.' First proposed in 2008, the $8 billion pipeline project has been beset by delays in Nebraska over its route and at the White House, where the president has resisted prior efforts by Congress to force him to make a decision. In 2012, Obama rejected the project after Congress attached a measure to a payroll tax cut extension that gave him a deadline to make a decision. The pipeline's developer, TransCanada Corp., then reapplied. Obama has said he will not be forced to make a decision on the pipeline, which requires presidential approval because it crosses an international border, until the review process concludes. Federal agencies' comments on whether the project is in the national interest are due Monday. 'The president is out of excuses,' South Dakota Sen. John Thune said Thursday. Environmental groups have called on Obama to reject the project outright, saying it would make it easier to tap a dirty source of energy that would exacerbate global warming. Friends of the Earth, a moneyed green group, called Hoeven's bill 'doomed.' The State Department's analysis, assuming higher oil prices, found that shipping oil by rail or tankers would be worse for the planet.","Vote was 62-36 with nine Democrats joining 53 Republicans .

"These lakes may look like they are full of bizarre floating sea cratures, but they are actually filled with thousands of frozen bubbles. Snapped across Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, the natural wonders are made of highly flammable gas methane. The gas - emitted by bacteria after they consume dead organic matter - is fairly harmless, but these bubbles can cause an explosion if lit. Scroll down for a video showing bubbles being ignited . A photographer has captured amazing images of methane bubbles in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. Pictured are some methane gas bubbles underneath Vermillion Lake . Paul Zizka, 35, tracked down the natural phenomenon, which he photographed at Lake Minnewanka, the Vermillion Lake and Abraham Lake. Abraham Lake is the most commonly-photographed spot for the spectacular sight. But adventure-loving Mr Zizka, who loves to explore, revealed Lake Minnewanka offers rival views - but is just a little trickier to get to. He said: 'All three lakes are ever-changing, cover wide areas and provide endless possibilities for the keen landscape photographer. 'They are magical places to explore and I find myself returning to them often. 'The methane bubbles depicted in the photographs have generated a lot of buzz primarily on social media. 'Many people have never seen the phenomenon before. 'People marvelled at the beauty of them and wondered what they really were.' The pictures show a frozen lake with the icy 'circles' trapped underneath in fascinating formations . The frozen bubbles form when microbes consume dead organic matter on the bottom of the lake. In the summer the bubbles simply rise to the surface and pop, but in the winter they are frozen within the ice. Bubbles are seen around a larger chunk of frozen snow on the right .

'They are magical places to explore and I find myself returning to them often,' said Mr Zizka . Unusual pancake shaped ice formations that are more typically seen in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice were found floating on a river in Scotland back in December. The dinner plate-sized ice 'pancakes' have formed on a quiet stretch of the River Dee in Aberdeenshire. The strange formations were photographed at the Lummels Pool, Birse, near Aboyne, by Jamie Urquhart, a biologist for the River Dee Trust. The pancakes are thought to have formed from foam created by faster flowing water further upstream, accumulating in a corner of a pool. Freezing temperatures last week caused the foam to freeze, and the current bashed them into a circular shape. Normally pancakes form on ocean water or lakes around the Arctic circle where the movement of water keeps the ice from forming a flat sheet. However, they do ooccasionally occur on rivers when temperatures drop low enough. Officials at the Dee River Trust said it is the first time they have seen pancake ice form on the river. The strange phenomena is caused when permafrost in the area begins to thaw out. Organic matter stored in the bottom of the lake begins to thaw out, and microbes decompose it, releasing methane. Methane does not dissolve into the water, and instead forms bubbles that rise to the surface. In summer, the methane bubbles simply rise to the surface and pop to enter the atmosphere. However, when the lake is frozen in the winter, the bubbles become trapped on their way to the surface. In a video, Professor Katey Walter Anthony from the University of Alaska likened it to a ‘time-lapse photograph’ of methane emissions from the lakes. It should be noted, however, that the methane bubbles can be dangerous - a molecule of methane is 25 times more potent as a heat-trapping gas than carbon dioxide. If you were to ‘pop’ one of the bubbles and hold a match over it, it would ignite. In the summer, the methane bubbles simply rise to the surface and pop and enter the atmosphere.

"Four Wisconsin middle school students have been arrested after allegedly throwing a 'sex party' off campus and recording it on their phones. Police are recommending that the students, who could be as young as 13, be charged with first and second-degree sexual assault of a minor. Authorities say several students attended the 'sex party' at a classmate's home in Brown Deer, Wisconsin, during the holiday break, WISN-TV reports. The four students, who could be as young as 13, have been referred to prosecutors to face charges up to first and second-degree sexual assault of a minor . Police got involved when a student who attended the 'sex party' over Christmas break told a teacher at Brown Deer Middle School . Only four are accused of participating in sex acts during the party. Police do not believe the students posted the videos they recorded on social media. The allegations shocked the small, middle-class Milwaukee suburb and horrified parents. Police got involved when one student told teachers at Brown Deer Middle School about the party. School administrators called detectives, who opened a criminal investigation. The case has been referred to prosecutors, who will decide how to charge the teens. 'We're trying to send a clear message that this type of behavior isn't going to be condoned by law enforcement, nor school officials, nor shouldn't be by parents, really, when we're talking kids that are middle-school age,' Brown Deer Police Chief Michael Kass told WISN. School administrators said that because the incident happened off school grounds, there is nothing they can do about it. However, they credited their work educating students to report criminal activity if they see it.","Several students attended the 'sex party' at a classmate's house over the holiday break .

"Jailed: Dayle Leatherland has pleaded guilty to benefits fraud and been sentenced to six months in prison at Wolverhampton Crown Court . A benefits cheat claimed he was so disabled he could not work - but in fact he was working as a security guard, patrolling large sites with his rottweiler dogs. Dayle Leatherland falsely claimed £34,000 from the taxpayer by pretending he could walk no more than 10 yards with the aid of a stick, and needed help getting in and out of bed or up and down stairs. However, investigators discovered that he played an active role running his own guard dog company, and he was spotted patrolling sites on foot with enormous rottweilers. Leatherland, 51, was paid a total of £33,924 in incapacity benefit, disability living allowance and income support which he was not entitled to. He was jailed for six months at Wolverhampton Crown Court after pleading guilty to six charges of benefit fraud. The court heard Leatherland filled in self-assessment forms claiming he was so severely disabled he couldn't tie his own shoe laces. His six-year scam was exposed in May 2013, after it was discovered he ran a business called D. Leatherland Dog Handling Services from his home in Tipton, West Midlands. DWP investigators also found details that he had been employed by companies to guard sites and patrol with his dog at locations up to 60 miles from his home. Prosecutor Mark Jackson said: 'He claimed the consequences of numerous physical problems were that he could only walk a few steps very slowly before feeling severe discomfort. 'He said his ankle would give way causing him to stumble. The picture he presented was one of acute physical difficulty and he was categorised as being virtually unable to walk. 'This was completely incompatible with the reality of him running his own business as a security guard specialising in dog handling. If officials had known the true situation he would not have had any benefit at all.' Adrian Stephens, defending, said he had built up debts of £56,000 while installing a conservatory and adding an extension to his home. Fraud: Leatherland was in fact running his own business as a handler for rottweiler guard dogs . He added: 'Operations are still being carried out to correct deformities. He then got work he felt he could do and he either misunderstood the situation or turned a blind eye. 'He was focused on these very severe debts and this was a way of paying some of them. There was no lavish lifestyle, luxury holidays or fast cars. He did what he did to clear his debts, he made the wrong choices.' Sentencing him to prison, judge John Warner said: 'You painted a totally false picture of yourself to the authorities. 'These were quite cynical claims you made claiming you were unfit to work. 'Lots of people from all sorts of walks of life have financial difficulties and do not turn to dishonesty to sort out these problems.'","Dayle Leatherland, 51, claimed he was unable to walk more than 10 yards .

"In the battle of the broadcasters, Sky has announced plans to launch its own mobile network, powered by O2. O2's owner Telefónica UK  will give Sky wholesale access to 2G, 3G and 4G voice and data services, with the first deals expecting to launch in 2016. Sky is hoping to rival fellow broadcaster Virgin Media, which uses EE's network for its mobile services, and BT, which is said to be in talks to buy EE. O2's owner Telefónica UK will give  Sky wholesale access to 2G, 3G and 4G voice and data services. The first deals are expected to launch in 2016. Sky is the country's second-largest provider of home broadband and is the most popular 'triple-play' provider, with 40% of customers taking its TV, telephone and broadband . Additionally, Three is  poised to buy O2. Under the terms of Sky's multi-year deal, Telefónica UK will share its network with the media giant across the UK, and the first services will launch next year. Jeremy Darroch, Group Chief Executive, Sky said: 'Sky has a proven ability to launch new services, at scale. 'Through our partnership with Telefónica UK, we can build on our expertise to launch a range of exciting new services and exploit the opportunities for growth in the fast-changing mobile sector.' Sky is the country's second-largest . provider of home broadband since entering the market seven years . ago, with more than 5 million customers. Under the terms of Sky's multi-year deal, Telefónica UK will share its network, and the first services will launch next year. Meanwhile, Telefónica UK already rents part of its network to Tesco Mobile. Sky is hoping to rival fellow broadcaster Virgin Media, which shares EE's network, and BT, which is said to be in talks to buy EE. Additionally, Three's owner Hutchison Whampoa is said to be poised to buy Telefónica. Vodafone was initially seen as a leading contender for the wholesale . partnership with Sky as the two firms already have content partnerships . in place. Vodafone Red 4G customers can get access to Sky Sports as part of their plan, for example. Instead, Vodafone is planning to launch a broadband and TV service later this year that will use its Cable and Wireless business fibre network, and BT's Openreach network. It is also said to be the most popular 'triple-play' provider, with almost 40 per cent of its customers taking its three services - TV, telephone and broadband. Adding a mobile service would make it a so-called 'quad-play provider.' More recently, it launched a mobile TV service Sky Go that lets people watch live and on-demand  films and TV shows on their phones and tablets. Financial terms of the partnership were not given and an O2 spokesman said the deal would not affect existing O2 customers. Meanwhile, Telefónica UK already rents part of its network to Tesco Mobile and showing its willingness to open its network to Sky could help it gain regulatory approval for its acquisition by Three. If this acquisition is approved, it will create the country's largest mobile network. Ewan Taylor-Gibson, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline: 'Sky is keeping up with the Joneses - Virgin Media, TalkTalk and potentially BT later this year - to become the latest telecoms giant to offer all four services. 'Quad play is proving all the rage amongst telecoms providers, but mobile often seems like the afterthought of these four-way bundles. 'Many customers are already tied into long contracts so aren't in the market for a new mobile deal. 'The advantage is that all your services are under one roof, making billing far simpler, but if one service isn't up to scratch, it can be harder to leave. Meanwhile, the biggest fixed-line provider, BT, is in . talks to buy EE  as companies increasingly . seek to offer a package of services including fixed and mobile . calls, broadband and entertainment.

Vodafone is planning to launch a broadband and TV service later this year that will use its Cable and Wireless business fibre network, and BT's Openreach network. Pricing details, and what TV content will be offered, has yet to be announced. Commenting on the Sky and Telefonica UK partnership, Paolo Pescatore, director of apps and media at CCS Insight said: 'Sky was forced down this route. It can't afford to be left behind in the multi-play market. 'With BT's plans to launch a consumer mobile offering and the acquisition of EE as well as Vodafone's plans to offer broadband and TV, Sky had no choice but to launch its own mobile offer.' Dominic Baliszewski, telecoms expert at broadbandchoices added: 'This is further proof of the UK’s inevitable shift towards ‘Quad-Play’ services, but it remains to be seen how quickly customers will adopt these new bundles. 'At the moment, just understanding the new mobile world order is going to be confusing enough for customers with Sky teaming up with Telefonica, Telefonica selling O2 to Three and BT buying EE outright. 'When the dust settles and packages become available it is important that customers are given clear information to help them understand how these deals are structured, priced and delivered if they are to avoid signing up to something that they don’t really need.'","Sky has announced plans to launch a mobile network, powered by O2 .

"A brawl broke out during a meeting to discuss the conduct of police in the city where riots erupted after a black teenager was shot dead by a white officer. The audience grew restless as police officers spoke out against a proposed civilian oversight board that would examine the force's actions in future at St Louis City Hall. Missouri state Democrat Jeff Roorda, who is also business manager of the city's police union, reportedly became involved in a slanging match with meeting chairman Terry Kennedy.

Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot after a confrontation in August with then-Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who resigned from the department late last year. The shooting led to widespread unrest in and around the St Louis suburb, including some protests that resulted in local business being burned and looted. Protests again turned violent on November 24 when a grand jury investigating the case  decided there wasn't enough evidence to indict Wilson.","Tensions boiled over proposed law for civilian oversight of police conduct .

"Armed robbers left a trail of blood and destruction as they rampaged through a shopping mall in South Africa, leaving seven people injured. Two of those hurt were alleged bandits following the attempted heist at around 11.15am today at the Bedford Centre in Bedfordview, a town around 12 miles east of central Johannesburg. Gauteng police had sealed off the crime scene this afternoon to collect evidence following the shootout between a group of armed men  and security guards. A police officer stands next to a trail of blood reportedly from one of the robbers after a botched heist inside the Bedford Shopping Centre near Johannesburg . A handgun and blood splatter left after the shooting at the shopping mall in Bedfordview . Seven people were wounded in the shootout, including two alleged robbers and three store customers . People attend to the injured, left bleeding on the floor next to a pile of broken glass left by stray bullets . Among the injured were three customers caught in the crossfire and two security guards. Police recovered an AK-47 and an unlicensed handgun at the scene. The 9mm could be seen in one of a number of dramatic pictures showing the popular shopping centre's bright white floor smeared with a vivid trail of blood, while the ground was also strewn by broken glass caused by stray bullets. A video tracking the path of blood was posted onto a page called Special Operations Group on Facebook. The botched robbery reportedly targeted a bank inside the mall, according to vocativ.com, with the gang approaching security guards who were collecting cash from a bank before a short but intense firefight broke out. He added that the guards were both shot in the leg and are in a stable condition. Netcare 911 spokesperson Santi Steinmann told News24 that the shooting happened at about 11:15, and paramedics received the call at about 11:30. Those who had been shot are in a serious to critical condition and have been taken to various hospitals, Netcare 911 spokesperson Santi Steinmann. Other suspects may be at large, police confirmed.

"Former world number one Lleyton Hewitt has set a date to end his celebrated tennis career with plans to play his 20th and last Australian Open next year. The 33-year-old plans to bypass the French Open to focus on one last crack at Wimbledon and Davis Cup glory before ending his career at Melbourne Park in 2016. Hewitt outlined his dream farewell from tennis on Thursday after being confirmed as Australia's Davis Cup captain-in-waiting following Pat Rafter standing down. Lleyton Hewitt plans to bypass the French Open to focus on one last crack at Wimbledon and Davis Cup glory before ending his career at the Australian Open in 2016 . The father of three said he hopes he won't be required to step up until after playing a part in a triumphant Australian campaign this year. 'I've thought long and hard,' he said. 'I plan to play the Aussie Open next year and most likely finish then. 'Obviously for me the Davis Cup is something we've worked extremely hard to put ourselves in a position in the World Group where we have a genuine shot.' With the emergence of two-time teenage grand slam quarter-finalist Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic's resurgence, Hewitt believes Australia has the talent to win the prestigious teams' event for a 29th time in 2015. Hewitt, pictured here at the Australian Open in 1998, outlined his dream farewell from tennis on Thursday after being confirmed as Australia's Davis Cup captain-in-waiting following Pat Rafter standing down . The father of three - Mia, Cruz and Ava - plans to bypass the French Open this year to focus on finishing at Melbourne Park . 'I believe with the guys now we have a lot more options, a lot more depth,' he said. 'I feel like I can still put my hand up as a player and help the boys get over the line. 'Whether that's singles, doubles, whatever is needed. Right at the moment that's the main focus for us. 'Personally, I'll be looking towards the grasscourt season and most likely finishing here in Melbourne, which for me would obviously be special to play 20 Australian Opens.' The former world No.1 plans to play only sparingly in 2015 and says he'll 'most likely' skip Roland Garros to focus on Wimbledon, where he won his second and last grand slam crown in 2002. Hewitt, pictured here following his loss to Marat Safin of Russia in the men's final at the 2005 Australian Open, has long been groomed for the Davis Cup captain . The father of three said he hopes he won't be required to step up to the captaincy until after playing a part in a triumphant Australian Davis Cup campaign this year . As Australia's longest-serving and most prolific Davis Cup singles winner, Hewitt has long been groomed for the captaincy. Pat Rafter stood down as skipper to formally assume the role as Tennis Australia's director of performance and said Hewitt would succeed interim captain Wally Masur 'when the time is right and ready'. Masur, who won the Davis Cup twice as a player in 1983 and 1986 before serving as coach during John Fitzgerald's tenure, will take the reins for the World Group first-round tie against the Czech Republic in Ostrava from March 6-8. Hewitt has lived in the Bahamas with his wife Bec, 31, and their three young children . As Australia's longest-serving and most prolific Davis Cup singles winner, Hewitt has long been groomed for the Davis Cup captaincy . 'Lleyton has an undeniable link with Davis Cup and he will be captain one day,' Masur said. 'It's not in the model in Australian tennis to have a playing captain as such. 'Obviously (we) spoke to Lleyton a few days ago about it and we've come to the arrangement that he's still a player, he still has a career to flesh out and see where that ends. 'Until that happens, I'll be captain.'","Lleyton Hewitt outlined his dream farewell from tennis on Thursday after being confirmed as Australia's Davis Cup captain-in-waiting .

"Super Bowl advertisers are being careful not to offend with this weekend's television spots, going for cute, cuddly and sentimental as opposed to the sexy commercials of years past. The millions who tune in on Sunday can expect lots of puppies and relatable celebrities, as opposed to scantily clad women and sexual situations, with even the Victoria's Secret Angels fully clothed in the brand's teaser spot - although they reveal more in their actual Super Bowl ad. And an anti-domestic abuse commercial will have a high profile-spot during the game after a year of domestic violence scandals in the NFL. Scroll down for videos . The Victoria's Secret Angels are covered up in teaser's for their Super Bowl spot . Budweiser will feature an adorable puppy, and a Clysdale in a commercial they premiered earlier this week . Mindy Kaling will get invisible in an ad for Nationwide . Carl's Jr. is sticking with the sex, and, as is tradition, will feature a model enjoying one of their burgers . That's not all either,  with Kim Kardashian and Lindsay Lohan toning down the sexy and mocking themselves for T-Mobile and Esurance respectively, and one of America's most beloved sitcom actresses, Mindy Kaling, pretending she is invisible for a Nationwide ad that has already been heavily teased. Of course, they aren't all devoid of sex, with Carl's Jr. going very sexy as usual with a naked model enjoying one of their burgers. Advertisers have to find a balance between grabbing people's attention and not going too far to shock or offend a broad base of more than 110 million viewers. They want to be sure to make the estimated $4.5 million they're spending for a 30-second Super Bowl ad worth it. This year, that seems to mean erring on the side of caution. 'Companies are being more prudent,' said MediaPost columnist Barbara LIppert. 'It's also a very weird atmosphere with all the coverage about deflated balls and domestic abuse. Maybe advertisers want to be a little more careful in that climate.' Wix.com went for non-edgy laughs with an ad that shows retired football players coming up with funny fictional businesses, like Brett Favre . Kim Kardashian is poking fun at her image in a T-Mobile spot . It's a far cry from the dot.com commercial attempts in 2000, when an E*Trade ad showed a monkey in a garage and touted the fact that the company had just wasted $2 million dollars, but MediaPost's Lippert says it makes sense to be restrained. Even GoDaddy, which made its name with racy Super Bowl spots since it began advertising 11 years ago, has been moving away from being edgy; last year one of its Super Bowl ads focused on a woman running a small business. This year, they promised a warm and fuzzy ad featuring a puppy, spoofing a Budweiser ad from last year that also featured a puppy. But the twist at the end of GoDaddy's spot showed the puppy was being sold online via a web site created with Godaddy.com. After it debuted early, a social media storm erupted, with pet lovers finding the ad offensive. GoDaddy said late Tuesday it wouldn't air the ad. 'At the end of the day, our purpose at GoDaddy is to help small businesses around the world build a successful online presence,' said CEO Blake Irving. 'We underestimated the emotional response."" GoDaddy says it has another ad it plans to run.' Wix.com, which helps people build web sites, has taken a lesson from GoDaddy. Instead of debuting as a Super Bowl advertiser with a racy spot like GoDaddy did when it was a new advertiser, Wix.com went for non-edgy laughs with an ad that shows retired football players coming up with funny fictional businesses. Brett Favre, for instance, invents a charcuteries business called Favre and Carve. Other companies appear to be playing it safer too by not focusing so much on bare skin and sophomoric humor. A Victoria's Secret 90-second teaser ad showed supermodels fully dressed as football players. The actual Super Bowl ad shows the models dressed in Victoria's Secret lingerie, though. And the NFL is airing a public service announcement from NoMore, a coalition of anti-domestic abuse organizations. The ad depicts a chilling 911 call from a battered woman to demonstrate the terror of domestic abuse.","Super Bowl advertisers are going for cute, cuddly and sentimental spots as opposed to the sexy commercials of years past .

"Close your eyes and imagine the numbers one to nine on a line. Most people will see a horizontal line, with one on the left, and an orderly progression to nine on the right – a tendency known as the 'mental number line.' But the preference for counting from left to right isn't just a human trait - it's also shared by newborn chicks. Scroll down for video . Chicks count from left to right just like humans do, according to researchers at the University of Padova . The University of Padova in Italy wanted to see if the number line develops with cultural experience or if it is an innate behaviour. Their findings suggest it is innate, with chicks appearing to use the line when presented with two different panels with markings on them depicting numbers. The researchers also note that the brain's asymmetry could have played a role in shaping the mental number line long ago. During the study, researchers first familiarised chicks with the number five. Scientists have suggested that golden orb-web spiders may be able to 'count'. The arachnids create 'prey larders' of victims trapped in their webs and it appears that they are able to keep track of how many meals they have left. Scientists observed that the spiders search for missing prey when it is taken from their webs. Golden orb-web spiders (Nephila clavipes) wait for prey to fly into their webs, but dead insects are sometimes stolen from their sticky nets by other spiders. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee controlled the number of prey items in the spiders' 'larders' by giving them mealworm larvae and taking them away again. They discovered that the arachnids search for them if they are removed from their web. Dr Rafael Rodríguez, who led the research, said: We can make a tentative conclusion that these spiders possess a sense of numerosity.' They then showed the chicks two different panels - one on the left and one on the right - that both depicted the same, smaller value two. The noticed the majority of chicks approached the panels to their left in search of a food reward. Professor Rugani and her colleagues then showed the chicks two identical panels, both depicting a larger value, eight. This time, they discovered that most of the chicks chose to investigate the panels to their right. The researchers repeated their experiment using eight as the small value, 32 as the large value, and 20 as the chicks' new target value. After familiarising a group of chicks with the number 20, they found that the majority of those chicks wandered to the left when presented with panels depicting the smaller value. Most of the chicks gravitated to the right when the panels displayed the larger value. Professor Rosa Rugani claims the trait likely evolved millions of years ago, before human ancestors split from those of modern birds. Professor Rosa Rugani claims the trait likely evolved millions of years ago, before human ancestors split from those of modern birds. Researchers now plan to look at the mental number line in other creatures . She says evolution could have led to brain asymmetry as it allowed animals to process information within a dominant hemisphere. Researchers now plan to look at the mental number line in other creatures. Professor Rugani told the IBTimes UK: 'I would not at all be surprised that the number spatial mapping is also found in other animals and in newborn infants. 'We are now extending the investigation to the study of other animal species. The final aim is to identify the neural areas involved in the number processing.' Previous research has found that seven-month-old infants prefer to count left-to-right, regardless of where they're born, according to Discover Magazine. That preference can change as children gain experience that changes right-to-left counting – for example, learning to read in a right-to-left writing system.","Trait may have evolved before human ancestors split from those of birds .

"Charged: Eboni Tucker-Smith, 32, has been arrested after her children were found in filthy conditions . A mother has been charged with neglect after police found her six children living in a filthy, roach-infested home without power or running water. Eboni Tucker-Smith, 32, was charged on Tuesday, several days after her partner DaQuan Smith, 35, and mother, Delthy Graham, 50, were also charged with child neglect in the incident. Officers found the  'deplorable conditions' at the Ocoee, Florida home on January 22 as they served a warrant after energy companies reported that the family had thousands of dollars in outstanding fees. At the home, officers found toilets filled with feces, trash piled up inside and outside the home, and dog feces throughout the house, according to the arrest affidavit, the Orlando Sentinel reported. 'There was old and current dog feces on the floors and beds of which appeared to be where the children slept,' according to the police. 'In two children's bedrooms the beds were old and dirty with mold and rust stains on them. I observed insects on top of the beds (roaches) and rotting food on the floors and the beds.' A broken window in the bedroom had been used to throw trash into the backyard. Police also observed that the refrigerator did not close all the way and was filled with roaches both dead and alive, and that there was a loaded handgun in the master bedroom. Disgusting: Police found trash filling the yard and inside the house, as well as dog feces throughout the home, cockroaches and rodents, according to a report. The home also had no water or gas . Arrests: The children's grandmother Delthy Graham, 50, left, and dad DaQuan Smith, 35, were also charged . 'The backyard of the home was filled with garbage bags, these bags had rotten food, roaches and I observed a rodent inside a fast food bag,' read the report. The house had no running water or gas, and neighbors sent police photographs showing the children stealing their water by filling up bottles - as instructed by Tucker-Smith. Police removed the six youngsters from the home and they were turned over to a family member. Authorities first learned about the sickening living conditions when Tucker-Smith was arrested in November for allegedly presenting a fraudulent document to lower her water bill at Ocoee City Hall. She told police at the time that she didn't know if anyone would be taking care of her children while she was in jail, so police officers went to the house. Scene: Neighbors had also complained about the family living at the home, pictured, in Ocoee, Florida . Inside, they found broken windows, overflowing toilets, insects and rodents, police said. The Department of Children and Families were called in but could not get inside the home. Tucker-Smith's mother said they were planning to leave the home - but they didn't. After the failed visit from DCF and unpaid utility bills, the power was shut off, and police secured a search warrant earlier this month. They found the home in the same conditions and that the family was squatting there, they said.","Eboni Tucker-Smith, 32, was charged with neglect on Tuesday after her six children were found living in 'deplorable conditions' in her Florida home .

"The U.S. military has chosen a new Boeing model to replace its current fleet of Air Force One . presidential aircrafts. The new Air Force One planes will be  Boeing Co's commercial 747-8 airliner, replacing the old Boeing 747-200Bs. The blue-and-white Air Force One has become a symbol for the President of the United States and has been the backdrop for many historic moments. Air Force One: The new fleet of Boeing 747-8 airliners will replace the  old Boeing 747-200Bs . The Pentagon had considered the A380 made by European aerospace giant Airbus, but opted for home-grown talent. 'The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the . United States (that) when fully missionized meets the necessary . capabilities established to execute the presidential support . mission,' said Air Force Secretary Deborah James in a statement. Boeing welcomed the Air Force's decision to skip a . competition and opt for the 747-8, citing its 50-year history of . building presidential aircraft. The Air Force now operates two VC-25s, specially configured . Boeing 747-200Bs. It said it planned to purchase enough of the technical . baseline to permit competition for maintenance during the . plane's planned 30-year life. James said the Air Force One program would use proven . technologies and commercially certified equipment to keep the . program affordable. Ride of the leader: The Air Force One airplane has become a symbol for the U.S. Presidency . Most recently,  President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were photographed stepping out of  Air Force One upon arrival in New Delhi, India for their state visit this week . The president's plane has long been a symbol of American power and the setting for historic moments, including the somber 1963 ceremony when Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office on board -- hours after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The plane is often portrayed in Hollywood films and inspired a 1997 thriller titled 'Air Force One' in which the US president, played by Harrison Ford, fought off hijackers. Outfitted with secure communications equipment and other gear, Air Force One is designed to serve as a 'mobile command center' and served that role briefly after the attacks of September 11, 2001. It also features a suite for the commander-in-chief that includes a large office, a conference room as well as a medical area that can function as an operating room. The plane's galley can feed up to 100 people and there are additional quarters for senior aides, Secret Service agents and other staff. Air Force One is technically the radio call sign adopted by any aircraft with the president on board but it has become identified with certain planes reserved for the president's air travel.","Boeing 747-8 to replace current fleet of Air Force One planes .

"If you fancy yourself as the next Bailey or Rankin, but only ever have your mobile phone to hand, all is not lost. The World Photo Organisation (WPO) has launched a new award to recognise excellent photographs taken on smartphones – and you can enter now. The London-based photographic authority has launched the award to celebrate the breadth and reach of images taken on phones, which can now take incredibly hi-resolution images. Atmospheric: The World Photo Organisation (WPO) has launched a new award to recognise excellent photographs taken on smartphones. The London-based photographic authority has launched the award to recognise the breadth and reach of images taken on phones (journalist's photo pictured, not entry) ‘Photography now exists in our pockets, and we want to celebrate this,’ it says. There are more mobile phones on Earth than human beings and the number of devices is growing five times as fast as the population. Smartphone cameras are increasingly being accepted as legitimate tools with which to take photos and now the WPO has confirmed this by adding an extra category to its 2015 Sony World Photography Awards. It says that the new category ‘allows us to look a little closer at those otherwise ordinary moments and to enjoy the creative freedom that mobile phone photography allows.’ Smartphone cameras are increasingly being accepted as legitimate tools to take photos - even without filters (example, pictured) The WPO says that mobile entries to the awards have ‘increased steadily year on year. ‘It was time for mobile phone photography to have its own dedicated platform, instead of taking the risk of losing some wonderful photos within the hundreds of thousands of entries we receive to the main awards.’ The organisation says: ‘We are asking for the extraordinary; to show us, through incredible mobile phone photography, the inspirational moments that life is capable of providing us.’ Anyone can enter up to three photos for free before February 27. The brief reads: ‘You get out of life what you put in. Push past the obvious and see the inspiration all around you. 'Discover the extraordinary by using your mobile phone to view the world through a different lens.’ Photographs must be shot with a smartphone and be high resolution enough – a minimum of 800KB - to be printed out and shown at an exhibition. Up to 20 photos will be shortlisted by a panel of judges, before being posted online between March 10 and 17, so the public can vote for the winner. The overall winner will receive a bundle of Sony Mobile products, including an Xperia smartphone and tablet, as well as attending the Sony Photography Awards gala ceremony. Runners-up will see their entry shown at the exhibition from April 14 to May 10 and will also win a smartphone. The WPO says that mobile entries to the awards have ‘increased steadily year on year. ‘It was time for mobile phone photography (two example shown) to have its own dedicated platform, instead of taking the risk of losing some wonderful photos within the hundreds of thousands of entries we receive to the main awards’ Acknowledging the new category may open the floodgates to hundreds of badly-shot images of coffee cup art, the WPO says: ‘We understand that the sheer number of mobile devices now at our disposal does not guarantee quality, but quite the opposite. ‘The democratisation of imagery, and our means of producing that imagery, leaves our medium more vulnerable than ever before to a flood of low quality, unintelligent photography that is neither sustainable in the long run, nor healthy in the short. ‘But through the versatility that our mobile devices offer, the Mobile Phone Award will strive to offer a platform for the peak of what’s achievable - the most inspiring, the most thoughtful, and even, just maybe, the most ground breaking.’ There are now more mobile phone devices on Earth than human beings and the number of devices is growing five times as fast as the population. Smartphone cameras (stock image) are increasingly being accepted as legitimate tools to take photos, as recognised by the introduction of the award .

"Ed Miliband has been accused of trying to ‘airbrush out’ his party’s shameful record on the NHS in Wales after it removed all references to the health service in leaflets sent out there. The Labour leader has claimed he will make the general election a fight about the future of the NHS but the party, which has been embarrassed by the poor-state of the Labour-run NHS in Wales, has left off any mention of health in campaign literature posted to homes there. It comes as a poll shows Labour voters have higher levels of satisfaction with the NHS than other parties, despite Mr Miliband's dire warnings that it is in peril. Labour leader Ed Miliband has claimed he will make the general election a fight about the future of the NHS but the party has left off any mention of health in campaign literature posted to homes in Wales . Patients in Wales are suffering lengthening delays to receive treatment and waiting time targets have not been met for more than four years. A Labour leaflet currently being sent to constituencies across England boasts about the party’s ‘plan for the NHS’ and includes several images of nurses, doctors and hospitals. But the version being delivered to Welsh homes has been modified so it makes no mention of the health service or Labour’s appalling record there. The English pamphlet, which has the headline ‘Building an NHS with time to care’, has a picture on the front-page of Mr Miliband and Labour’s shadow health secretary Andy Burnham visiting a hospital. The Labour leaflet sent to Welsh voters includes the party’s plans for immigration, but does not have a single mention of the NHS and includes none of the images of the health service . It warns ‘our NHS is at risk’ alongside details of how Labour will introduce new controls on immigration. The version of the leaflet sent to Welsh voters also includes the party’s plans for immigration, but does not have a single mention of the NHS and includes none of the images of the health service. Instead it talks about issues such as raising the minimum wage, freezing energy bills and introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax. Labour’s candidates in Wales have also chosen to avoid talking about the NHS in literature sent to voters. Constituents in Aberconwy, Cardiff Central and Cardiff North have all received letters from their local candidates setting out what they would do if elected, but none of them a single mention of the health service. Labour's leaflet in England makes great play of his policies on the NHS . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘Ed Miliband wants to airbrush out the chaos his party has caused in the Welsh health service. ‘Labour cut the NHS budget there by eight per cent and now Wales has the worst urgent ambulance response times since records began. ‘We know he wants to “weaponise” the NHS in England, but in Wales his party don’t even defend their record. ‘In England we invested in the NHS and are committed to supporting hardworking staff – while Labour turn their back on the NHS in Wales, and still haven’t learnt that patients must always come before politics.’ Mr Miliband has been accused of saying in private that he wants to ‘weaponise’ the NHS during the election campaign. As he launched Labour’s health manifesto in Manchester earlier this week, he said: ‘The future of our NHS is at stake in this general election.’ A Wales Audit Office report this week found waiting time targets have not been met by the Labour-run government since September 2010 and performance has been getting worse. By contrast, the NHS in England and Scotland, where Labour is not in power, is performing better against tougher targets. According to the report, one in ten patients in Wales had to wait more than 26 weeks for treatment - the target is one in 20 - and three per cent waited more than 36 weeks in March last year. It added that the causes for the longer waits 'boil down to the inability of NHS Wales as a whole to sustainably match the supply of healthcare with demand for services'. However, there has been a significant jump in satisfaction with the NHS among Labour voters in the last year. Some 69 per cent of supporters declared themselves satisfied with the system - up 11 points on 2013 and slightly ahead of Liberal Democrat voters (up five at 68 per cent) and Tories (unchanged at 67 per cent). Data from the latest British Social Attitudes survey - published by The King's Fund health think tank - found dissatisfaction across the board was at its lowest ever, with only 15 per cent giving the thumbs down. And an overall satisfaction score of 65 per cent meant this was the second best year for the NHS since 1983, topped only by 2010.","Labour promises to put the NHS at the heart of general election campaign .

"Maj. Gen. James Post allegedly told lower-ranking officers that talking to members of Congress about the A-10 aircraft was equivalent to treason . The Air Force is probing allegations that a Major General  told lower-ranking officers that talking to members of Congress about the capabilities of the A-10 attack aircraft is equivalent to treason. The alleged comment by Maj. Gen. James Post, a prominent leader at the prestigious Air Combat Command, has stirred concern in Congress about the Air Force muzzling officers in violation of their legal rights. 'This is very serious, to accuse people of treason for communicating with Congress,' New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte told General Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, who testified on Wednesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Post is reported to have said the remarks to Air Force officers attending a recent weapons and tactics conference in Nevada. He allegedly said that it is their duty to support the service's budget priorities by refraining from offering opinions inconsistent with those priorities. Air Force leaders have proposed retiring the A-10 fleet but Congress has refused, and some inside the Air Force have sided with Congress. Post's alleged comments were first reported by Tony Carr, a retired Air Force officer who writes a blog called 'John Q. Public.' Carr said he learned of Post's comments from a number of officers who were in the audience at the time Post spoke. He said Post prefaced his remark in the closed-door conference by saying, 'If anyone accuses me of saying this, I will deny it'. Air Force leaders have proposed retiring the A-10 fleet but Congress has refused, and some inside the Air Force have sided with Congress (file photo) Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh III (pictured) testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday as the Air Force investigates allegations that Major General James Post . Post then added: 'Anyone who is passing information to Congress about A-10 capabilities is committing treason.' 'These comments can be seen as nothing less than an attempt to intimidate subordinates into refraining from exercising their rights to free expression and civic participation,' Carr wrote. The Air Force has not disputed that Post made the comment as reported. New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte said she was concerned that the Air Force is trying to find out which officers talked to Congress about the A-10 . 'We are aware of the concerns surrounding the alleged remarks made by General Post,' said Captain Andrew Schrag, a spokesman for Air Combat Command, who is in charge of the service's combat aircraft. 'We take this matter very seriously and are fully cooperating with the Secretary of the Air Force Inspector General's investigation,' he added. Another Air Force spokesman, Maj. Colin Hughes, said the Air Force investigation began January 22. In his remarks on Wednesday, Welsh said the Defense Department is overseeing an investigation of the matter by the Air Force inspector general. He added that he had personally intervened by calling Post after seeing a news report about his alleged comment. Pressed on the matter by Ayotte, Welsh said he found it 'not at all' acceptable for a general to make such a comment. 'I support any airman's right to discuss anything that you would like to discuss with them and to give you their honest opinion,' Welsh said. 'In this particular case, with the investigation ongoing, my job is to wait until the facts are known,' he added. 'It worries me about the climate and the tone that set if members — airmen, airwomen — are told that they would be committing treason for communicating with us,' Ayotte said. Ayotte said she was concerned that the Air Force is quietly trying to find out which officers talked to Congress about the A-10. Welsh said he was unaware of any such internal investigation. 'I would be astonished by that,' he said, adding, 'I would not condone it.' It is the ugliest aircraft in the Air Force's arsenal. The A-10, often called a warthog, was designed to destroy Soviet tanks and troops on the ground. Officially the Thunderbolt II, it was quickly nicknamed the Warthog for its unusual looks, . It was specifically designed around its main weapon, a 30mm cannon which fires 4,000 rounds a minute. The plane can fly low and slow, coming down to 50ft to shoot at or drop bombs on enemy positions. Its top speed is just above 400mph but it can go as slow as 150mph and 'loiter' for hours above targets making it an effective deterrent as well as an attack plane. The Warthog is covered in 1,200lbs of titanium armor, making it invulnerable to attack from anything but heavy weapons. Even when hit it is designed to fly home on one engine, with no tailfin and half a wing missing. On board the single-seater the pilot has at his controls the cannon, which is accurate to 4,000ft, and fires depleted-uranium shells, as well as Maverick air-to-surface missiles, 500lb free fall bombs, and Hydra air-launched rockets. Despite USAF attempts to retire the fleet, it is expected to remain in service into the 2020s. At one stage when the Air Force suggested retiring its more than 300 A-10s the Army indicated it would take them over as soldiers are so keen on its close support capabilities.

Footage of a Victorian policeman joining a dance circle at an Australia Day music festival has gone viral . The video, which has garnered almost 20,000 views, shows the policeman dancing in the middle of a large, enthusiastic circle of music-lovers, at one point dropping to the ground in mimic of the revellers. The police officer even takes off his hat and puts it on backwards while continuing to dance. The crowd around him appears to be very receptive to the unexpected addition to the al fresco dance floor, dancing around him and responding to his movements. 'I saw some people getting crazy in a small circle on the dancefloor while I was filming from our bar-rooftop,' said tech musician Gunner Guess, who performed at the four-day festival, on the video. 'Wondering why they're screamin [sic] out loud till I realized there was a special dancer with a yellow west, epic moment!!!' he said.

"Photojournalist: Bill Eppridge holds the camera that he took the iconic photograph with of a dying Robert F Kennedy on June 5, 1968. Eppridge died on Thursday at age 75 . Photojournalist Bill Eppridge, whose career included capturing images of a mortally-wounded Robert F. Kennedy, has died at age 75. Eppridge died on Thursday at a Danbury hospital in Connecticut after a brief illness, said his wife, Adrienne Aurichio. Eppridge was at the scene on June 5, 1968, when Kennedy, then a US senator who had just won California's Democratic presidential primary, had addressed campaign supporters at a Los Angeles hotel and was walking through its kitchen when shots rang out. He was hit in the head and neck and died 26 hours later from his wounds. He took some of the most well-known images after Kennedy was shot. One of those images, published in Life magazine, showed Kennedy lying on the floor in a pool of his blood, a hotel employee kneeling next to him. Scroll down for video... Captured: Eppridge took many famous pictures of RFK. Here the Senator is seen campaigning in Indiana during the presidential primary . Final moments: Eppridge took this famous photograph of Robert Kennedy sprawled semi-conscious in his own blood after being shot in his brain and neck while busboy Juan Romero sits next to him in the kitchen . Beautiful moment: Eppridge took this picture of Bobby Kennedy and his dog, Freckles, running on beach . Eppridge's career also included stints working for high-profile magazines such as Sports Illustrated and National Geographic. He photographed a wide range of subjects, including the Beatles, the Soviet Union, the Vietnam War, the Olympics and Woodstock. Eppridge, who lived in Connecticut, always had a camera with him, Aurichio said. ‘He was a photojournalist to the end,’ she told CBS News. A book of Eppridge's photographs of the Fab Four, ""The Beatles: Six Days That Changed the World. February, 1964"" (Rizzoli), is coming out early next year. Summer of 69: Some of most well-known photographs from Woodstock Music Festival were taken by Eppridge .

Vietnam War: Wounded Marine Arthur Hernderson is aided by his comrades after a skirmish with the Viet Cong in this picture taken by Eppridge . Eppridge took this picture of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in Vietnam during the bombing of the North . Celebrities: Eppridge also famously took pictures of singers and movie stars, including Barbra Streisand . Rizzoli Books editor Robb Pearlman said of Eppridge, ‘He was an amazing photographer, but more than that, a gentleman and a mensch. He told us amazing stories about his time at Life Magazine, sometimes several times over, but they never got old.’ Eppridge's funeral will be private, with a memorial service to follow, she said.","Bill Eppridge was at the scene in 1968 when Senator Kennedy was shot in a Los Angeles hotel kitchen .

"A teacher who repeatedly had sex with a student starting when he was just 15 years old has been released from jail after two years. Kathryn Camille Murray, now 31, had to take a taxi from the Harris County Jail after she was released today - because no one was there to pick her up. Video from KPRC-TV shows Murray getting into a cab outside the jail. She appeared to be wearing blue jailhouse scrubs - with a cardigan sweater on top. Scroll down for video . Kathryn Murray, now 31, took a taxi from the Harris County Jail after she was released on Wednesdsay . Murray was ordered released for time served least week - two years - after she pleaded guilty to having sex with an eighth grade student . She held in her hands a pair of jeans - possibly what she wore the day she was arrested for a second time for having sex with student Jimmy Pallais. Kathryn Camille Murray, 31, was in court in Harris County, Texas on Wednesday for her sentencing after she pleaded guilty to sexual assault of a child and improper relationship with a student. But because she has been in jail since January 2013, the judge gave her credit for time served and ordered her to be released from jail without probation, KHOU11 reported. As she left the court at the end of the hearing, she was seen smiling, KPRC footage shows. Freed: Kathryn Murray, 31, smiled as she was sentenced to time served on Wednesday for repeatedly having sex with her 15-year-old student - even after she was arrested and ordered to keep away from him . In court: She must now register as a sex offender and has lost her teaching license . 'We are very disappointed with the sentence and never agreed with the sentence,' the boy's mother, Jenny Pallais, told KHOU. 'We are still working hard to put our family back together.' Her son Jimmy, who revealed his identity to ABC's 20/20 last year, had been adopted by the family from Costa Rica and brought to the U.S. when he was 14 - and barely spoke any English. Murray, who was 28 at the time, began tutoring the boy at Memorial Middle School to improve his English, and his parents noticed that he took a liking to the teacher. 'Every kid goes through that, has a crush on a teacher,' his father Alex told 20/20. 'This is an adolescent son with just a simple crush. That's it. We thought nothing of it.' Arrested: Murray, pictured left in a school photo and right in a mug shot, was tutoring the teenager to help him improve his English and they began a relationship after he wrote her a note expressing her feelings . In court: Murray leaves a Houston courtroom with attorney Robert Ross in July 2012 after her first arrest . He wrote his teacher a note to tell her how he felt about her, but ripped it up and asked her to throw the pieces in the trash - but she kept them and put them back together. 'She said, ""I read your letter,""' he told ABC. 'She told me, ""I really like you, like, for real."" I said, ""I really like you."" And she... told me, ""I know, but we can't have anything.""' The Pallaises expressed their concerns to the boy's principal and asked him to switch classes - but the teenager and teacher continued to speak on Facebook - and soon started a sexual affair. They had sex in Murray's classroom at least twice, as well as at his home and even at a hotel after his father dropped him off at a school dance, according to reports. Mrs Pallais then received a text message from the teacher that was meant for her son, reading: ''You know I love you... I don't know what we're going to do, but we're going to be happy together... I'm worried about how obvious we are at school. I miss you,' ABC reported. Then her 12-year-old son told her that he had gone into his brother's room one day while his parents were out to look for the dog and found Jimmy and Murray in bed together. Victim: Jimmy Pallais, pictured speaking with ABC 20/20 last year, was just 15 when he met Murray. After her arrest, he said that he felt guilty and depressed, and he considered committing suicide . Outrage: Jenny and Alex Pallais said they believe Murray took their son's childhood from him. Mrs Pallais learned about the affair after her 12-year-old son said he found Jimmy and Murray in bed together . His shocked mother went into her son's room and gathered up all the sheets and contacted the police, who ran a DNA test on the items. 'DNA from those sheets proved that she was there,' Alex Pallais told ABC. Murray, who also had sex with the boy in her classroom, was arrested but released on $50,000 bail. She was fired from her job and ordered to keep away from the teenager. But when he started sneaking out of his room at night, his parents hired an investigator who followed the boy to Murray's father's house. Police arrived at the house and Jimmy, who was then 16, tried to escape through the back door. She was arrested again. Scene: After learning about the relationship from her younger son, Mrs Pallais gathered all the sheets from her son's bed (pictured) and they later tested positive for Murray's DNA, she said . After she was arrested for the second time in January 2013, Jimmy said he became depressed over the guilt and considered committing suicide. His parents said they feel the illicit relationship 'took his innocence away'. 'She robbed him of his childhood,' his father Alex Pallais said. Murray will now have to register as a sex offender for life. Her attorney Robert Ross said: 'I'm just glad it's behind us, so is she, so is her family. She'll start anew with a good life.'

"ISIS militants and their supporters are using social media to encourage protesters in Ferguson to embrace radical Islam and fight against the U.S. government. Jihadists in Syria and Iraq and their sympathisers in the West have taken to Twitter to send messages of support to hundreds of demonstrators taking part in a ninth night of angry protests in the U.S. city following the shooting by police of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. The militants' tweets denounce local officers for the way they have attempted to quell the violence, make reference to historic acts of police brutality, and even use the hashtag #FergusonUnderISIS in an attempt to get angry young men in the city to declare allegiance to the Islamist group. The news comes as footage purportedly taken from the scene of the Ferguson protests appeared to show one demonstrator marching along a street holding a sign reading 'ISIS is here'. 'Chilling': Footage purportedly from a CNN live stream of the protests appeared to show one young demonstrator marching along a street holding a sign reading 'ISIS is here' Salena Zito - a political columnist for the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review newspaper - described as 'chilling' the footage of a Ferguson demonstrator purportedly holding an ISIS banner while standing behind a CNN reporter . Violence: The jihadists and their sympathisers in the West have taken to Twitter to send messages of support to hundreds of demonstrators taking part in a ninth night of angry protests in Ferguson (pictured) One ISIS sympathiser calling himself Mujahid Miski, who claims to be from Minneapolis–Saint Paul but suggests he is now based in 'the horn of Africa', has led the campaign to encourage those taking part in the protests to embrace radical Islam. In one message he tweets: 'So how is democracy treating you guys? #FergusonUnderIS #Ferguson.' He adds: 'I thought u guys back in #Ferguson were supposed to be Free & that u had equal rights. I'd really like to know what changed? #FergusonUnderIS'. Miski goes on to retweet dozens of messages by a Twitter user with the handle @AmreekiWitness, who claims to monitor and support the growth of radical Islam in the U.S.. As officers sat with guns pointed atop armored vehicles, the authorities used LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device) crowd control systems to send out a painful noise to try and disperse the crowd . Threat: One Twitter user with the handle @AmreekiWitness, who claims to monitor the growth of radical Islam in the U.S., has led the calls for Ferguson protesters to embrace ISIS' brutal branch of radical Islam . Encouragement: Amreeki Witness' Twitter messages focus on the treatment of black people in the U.S. and urge angry young black men to take up Islamic extremism . Amreeki Witness' messages focus on the treatment of black people in the U.S., praise Malcolm X for embracing Islam and urge angry young black men to take up the religion as it means the police 'will fear you'. In one message Amreeki Witness mocks the curfew police have imposed in Ferguson to bring an end to the disorder, saying: 'We IS guys hate you for your freedom, eh? Just like that freedom uplifting curfew in #Ferguson? Wake up, or they'll never let you outside.' As the social media campaign began to take hold, with dozens of radical Islamists commenting on the Ferguson protests, Amreeki Witness tweeted: 'May be time to organize the Muslims in America upon haqq and mobilize to #Ferguson. Defend the oppressed, start jihad here.' The message attracted a large response, with one Islamist calling himself Amarka Al-Ahlam responding: 'Preach, brother. We must organize brigades in preparation for the oncoming storm. #FergusonUnderIS #JihadinFerguson.' A lone man walks in front of police lines in Ferguson as 31 people are reported to have been arrested . New cause: As the social media campaign began to take hold, dozens of radical Islamists began commenting on the Ferguson protests . Ambition: This Twitter user appears to explain the reason ISIS sympathisers are attempting to hijack the Ferguson protest is because the militant group hope it will allow them to take control of the city . Amreeki Witness added: 'They cower in fear of us whilst they massacre and oppress you! It's time to strike fear into the hearts of the oppressors. #FergusonUnderIS'. News of the militants' campaign to encourage Ferguson demonstrators to embrace radical Islamism comes as footage purportedly from a CNN live stream of the protests appeared to show one young man holding a sign reading 'ISIS is here.' It is not known whether the banner - footage of which has not yet been independently verified - was in support of the militant group or, as seems more likely, it was an attempt to compare ISIS to the local police force or the U.S. government. Nevertheless stills of the alleged CNN footage were embraced by jihadists who have claimed they prove jihadists are already playing their part in the protests. Worrying: One ISIS sympathiser calling himself Mujahid Miski, who claims to be from Minneapolis-Saint Paul but suggests he is now based in 'the horn of Africa', has led the campaign to encourage those taking part in the protests to embrace radical Islam . Demonstrators have once again taken to the streets of Ferguson with their faces covered to protect against tear gas attacks by police . Chilling images of the alleged ISIS banner being carried by demonstrators have been widely shared by ISIS sympathisers on social media, who have used them to encourage supporters based in America to travel to Ferguson to further stoke the violence in the city. News of ISIS' attempt to hijack the Ferguson protests come as Palestinian Twitter users sent messages of support to the demonstrators and gave advice on the best way to cope with the tear gas police are using to disperse crowds. As images emerged of heavily armed police and armoured tanks on the streets of nearby St Louis, many Palestinian Twitter users expressed their solidarity with demonstrators. The messages of support from Palestinians come amid reports that many of the Ferguson protesters were heard chanting 'Gaza Strip' as they marched through the heart of the city. Two people were shot during another night of violence in Ferguson as police used stun grenades and tear gas on protesters who hurled rocks and bottles and in some cases Molotov cocktails. The ninth night of violence since the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown had started as an evening of peaceful protests. But the relatively peaceful protests eventually turned nasty on the streets of the St. Louis suburb after police in riot gear and gas masks formed a barricade and stood watch over the protesters for almost two hours. Ferguson descended into a ninth night of violence late on Monday night as police used stun grenades and teargas after they claimed that Molotov cocktails were thrown at them . A man is detained after a standoff with police on Monday during a protest for Michael Brown, who was killed by a police officer Aug. 9 in Ferguson . As officers sat with guns pointed atop armored vehicles, the authorities used LRAD (Long Range Acoustic Device) crowd control systems to send out a painful noise to try and disperse the crowd. Around 31 people were arrested overnight as police officers struggled to keep the situation under control, according to CNN. At a press conference early this morning, Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson defended police actions overnight, including the decision to begin clearing the streets, during which several journalists were taken into custody. Johnson used the press conference to remind both police and journalists that the world is watching their actions, while vowing to do whatever it took to make the community 'whole' again. With no curfew in order on Monday, police were strictly enforcing protesters to keep moving along the sidewalk or they were subject to arrest for unlawful assembly. The scene was relatively peaceful until midnight when tense standoffs lead to police throwing teargas and stun grenades . The Missouri National guard patrols a police command center on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson, Missouri . Eventually things deteriorated rapidly, with reports that shots were fired and Molotov cocktails thrown. One protester ripped out a Do Not Enter street sign and pointed it toward officers. Police responded by first throwing tear gas and stun grenades and then moving in with guns drawn to clear the area. CNN’s Don Lemon and Jack Tapper were presenting live from the middle of protests when teargas was thrown and they got caught up in the melee. Lemon was quick to put on his bullet proof vest and gas mask while continuing to present live TV. Tapper meanwhile was kind enough to give his mask to a photographer who had been on the receiving end of the tear gas attack. The reporters were eventually moved on by police, who said it wasn't safe for them to remain because there had been a shooting in the area where the media were presenting from.","ISIS supporters urge Ferguson demonstrators to embrace radical Islam .

"Drew Brees tried his best to stay out of the deflate-gate controversy, but his performance on Conan Wednesday will undoubtedly be pointed to as evidence of ...something. The New Orleans Saints quarterback was easily able to tell an under-inflated football from one that was within legal rules during a brief demonstration on the show. It isn't clear whether the gag on Conan was staged - but Brees could tell the inflation of two footballs - down to the pounds-per-square-inch. When asked about the deflate-gate scandal, Brees demurred: 'You know what? I have no idea. I know that it seems the NFL has been on this one now for the last few weeks. Scroll down for video . Drew Brees correctly determined that one football handed to him was 11psi - under-inflated - and other was 13psi - NFL legal . Brees knows from footballs. He is a former Super Bowl MVP and the youngest ever-quarterback to pass for 50,000 yards in his career - one of only six in NFL history . 'Obviously there always seems to be some topic going into Super Bowl week and this one just happens to be it. And yes, I will be asked this a thousand times and to be honest with you, I kind of chuckle because I'm just glad it has nothing to do with us.' When Conan O'Brien asked the former Super Bowl MVP whether they thought he could tell the different between an under-inflated ball and a legal one, he said: 'Throughout the course of a game, no. A ball will come up and you don't even think about how it feels. You're just programmed to go through your read, throw the ball, no excuses.' 'But we if sat here and just gripped one, I could probably tell the difference.' Conan handed Brees two footballs. The first, he correctly guessed at 13psi - within the NFL legal limit. The second, he guessed - correctly again - was 11 psi, illegal according to the rules of the NFL. The AFC Champion New England Patriots have been under the intense scrutiny ever since they won their trip to the Super Bowl earlier this month. Investigators found that 11 of the 12 balls used by the offense were at least 2psi below the 12.5psi league minimum. Quarterback Tom Brady, who is on his way to a record sixth Super Bowl, has repeatedly denied having any knowledge that the balls were under-inflated - despite such footballs being easier to catch and throw and harder to fumble.

"The memories may have faded, but these newly-found photos of bygone Britain are so clear they look as though they could have been taken yesterday. The remarkable collection portrays a forgotten age in the years after the Second World War as the country recovered from the conflict’s heavy toll and learnt to enjoy itself once more. Old-fashioned shops line streets dotted with classic 1950s and 1960s cars, couples wear their finest clothes as they enjoy an al fresco meal on their patio and children flock in their masses to church for Sunday schools. Happy as a sandboy: Two women and a young boy enjoy a day out at the beach at Hunstanton, Norfolk in 1960 . Other pictures show Heathrow in its earliest days, with passengers boarding a silver British European Airways plane directly from the tarmac. Another sees a family group enjoying a lazy summer's day in a punt and others show a country fair where a new car can be won for just a shilling. The slides, which date back to the 1950s and were taken mostly in St. Ives, Cambridgeshire, were among 200 found on eBay by collector Martin Snelling. He has spent the past six months collecting more than 6,000 retro slides as part of an art project documenting the changing face of Britain. Al fresco: A couple enjoy a spot of lunch on the patio outside their home on a sunny day in St. Ives in April 1958 . March: The Mayor is followed by a procession including a judge and a priest during the annual Mayor's Parade in St. Ives, 1960. The man with the top hat to the right of the vicar has been identified as Jack Bullen, town clerk of St. Ives at the time . Bygone age: The Queen Mother is seen visiting an agricultural show as crowds look and take pictures in this colourful shot from 1960 . The amateur photographer regularly picks up boxes of the pictures at auctions and car boot sales but bought the most recent batch of 200 slides for £13 on eBay. The seller posted two boxes to the amateur photographer but when he opened them up he found nearly all of them were all taken in St Ives. Believing the pictures were taken by one man named David Bryant, Mr Snelling, 44, launched an online campaign to return the album to its original owner or his descendants . He has now had contact with Mr Bryant's son, who has said he does not want to be reunited with the images. Quaint: A woman walks up a road winding parallel to the seafront at Bournemouth in this stunning picture taken in 1958 . Early days: A British European Airways flight is boarded by passengers at Heathrow in this colourful photo taken in the late 1950s . Scenic: Passengers casually lean out of the window of a steam train as it snakes through the Welsh hills in September 1958 . He did not disclose the reasons behind his decision but told the photographer that he wanted to get rid of the slides and had actually dumped them in a skip. Mr Bryant's son revealed his father and mother Molly as well as his sister Jane have all since passed away. Now Mr Snelling is hoping to track down the faces in the photos and reunite them with lost glimpses of their former lives. Boating: A group of men and women in swimsuits use oars to paddle along the Great Ouse this photo taken in 1960 . Artistic: Weathered boats docked in water near a church surrounded by trees at Hemingford Grey on the Great Ouse, near St. Ives . He said: 'There are other families involved who are in the photos and who I would like to get in touch with. 'There was a lot of information on these ones which helped me work out the people involved whereas other ones I collect have very little detail. 'It is a great feeling when you eventually reunite people with these childhood memories and I want to track down the faces in the pictures.' The father-of-three, from Portchester, Hampshire, added: 'They show a lot of family moments like christenings, weddings and family holidays. Sunday school: A large group of children gather for church school on a sunny day in Spring in St. Ives, Cambridgeshire in 1958 . Commemoration: A group of  men march up Market Hill, St Ives, Cambridgeshire, in this picture captioned Battle of Britain Parade, from 1960 . Wrapped up warm: A young girl wearing matching red gloves and wellington boots pictures in a garden in St. Ives in 1960 . 'The colours are amazing and still remain strong. They have been placed in glass and have obviously been in storage which has protected them from the light.' He added: 'I think I was searching eBay one day because I was in a creative rut. I picked up some slides for about £3 and got addicted. 'I just thought it would be interesting to see how people and places had changed over the past few decades. 'My wife isn't best pleased because the house is now full of boxes of photographic slides.' Break from the slopes: A group of skiers are seen relaxing and drinking outside a bar in Wengen, Switzerland in 1959 .

The sign 'help the spastics' is an outdated reference to cerebral palsy sufferers and is no longer acceptable to use . One of the particularly scenic photos was taken from a popular boathouse with upstairs tea rooms and a balcony overlooking the Geat Ouse. The boathouse was built by Ernest Giddins in the 1920s. After his early death, it was subsequently run by his brother Jack until it was taken over post-war by Jack's son Rodney. Sadly, the wooden building required major renovation and restoration during the 1970s and the funds were not available to carry out the work so it had to be demolished. In the late 1950s, a trip out on one of the boats would have cost around one shilling per hour or five shillings for the day. Pensive: This photo dates back to May 1958 and was captioned as the Bournemouth Round Table Conference . Procession:  A group of officials march through the street in front on onlookers during the annual Mayor's parade, St. Ives, in 1960 . Dated: A woman walks past Barton Chemist on Bridge Street, St. Ives, Cambridgeshire, in 1960 . Mr Snelling bought the slides on eBay on January 2 from a man who found them at an auction in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. The seller knew nothing of their history so Mr Snelling posted the images on social media, and he now wants to identify the people pictured in the album.

"A teenage girl is believed to have vanished with a man she had never met on Monday. Aysia Monique Lewis, 16, of Christiansburg, Virginia, was reported to be traveling with Donald 'Bruce' Quesenberry, Jr, 33, after he left his home in Normal, Illinois, to meet her. Virginia police began searching for the missing teen after she was last seen at the end of the day on Monday at Christianburg High School. Scroll down for video .

The pair are believed to be traveling in a 2002 light gold Nissan Altima - with Illinois plate V975074, according to wsls. Neither Quesenberry nor Miss Lewis have contacted relatives or friends since allegedly taking off together. Virginia State Police have classified the 16-year-old's disappearance as an endangered missing person alert and believe she may be in danger of sexual exploitation. Quesenberry has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. It is unclear if the pair have remained in the local area or left the state of Virginia. Police believe that Florida may be a possibility. According to a missing poster, Miss Lewis is 5'3' and weighs 160lbs. She has black hair with red highlights. The parents of the 16-year-old (pictured) have asked the 33-year-old man who took her to 'drop her off in a safe place' She was last seen wearing light blue jeans, a navy blue t-shirt, a black fleece, and brown moccasin-style shoes. Quesenberry was described as a white male with brown hair and brown eyes. He is 5'7' and weighs 195lb.

"Viewing several episodes of your favourite TV show in one session is bad for your health, researchers claim. A study has found that binge-watching series such as Game Of Thrones, Breaking Bad or Broadchurch is linked to depression and loneliness. People who suffer from low moods are more likely to spend hours or days viewing multiple episodes of their favourite programme online or on DVD box set. But by doing so they could neglect work, relationships and even their family. Danger: Marathon TV sessions, known as binge-watching, may actually be a sign of poor metal health . The researchers from the University of Texas at Austin said that binge-watching should no longer be considered a ‘harmless addiction’ and that people should think twice before settling in for a long session in front of the TV. They studied 316 people aged 18 to 29, asking how often they watched TV and how often they experienced negative emotions such as loneliness and depression. The findings showed a direct link. The worse somebody felt, the more likely they were to watch a lot of TV in an apparent attempt to avoid their low mood. The team’s full results will be presented at the Conference of the International Communication Association in Puerto Rico in May. However lead researcher Yoon Hi Sung said that the findings should be a wake-up call. ‘Even though some people argue that binge-watching is a harmless addiction, findings from our study suggest that binge-watching should no longer be viewed this way,’ she said. ‘Physical fatigue and problems such as obesity and other health problems are related to binge-watching and they are a cause for concern. When binge-watching becomes rampant, viewers may start to neglect their work and their relationships with others. ‘Even though people know they should not, they have difficulty resisting the desire to watch episodes continuously.’ Fears: The more lonely and depressed people were, the more likely they were to binge-watch - presumably to 'block out' their negative feelings, the U.S. researchers suggest . Millions of viewers in Britain own boxed sets or subscribe to services such as Netflix that give unlimited online access to films and TV shows. When an episode from a series ends on Netflix, it automatically starts screening the next episode after 15 seconds. In 2013 it made House Of Cards available all in one go online, rather than releasing an episode a week. Netflix has more than 3million UK subscribers – one household in ten – according to TV industry analysts BARB. Amazon Prime Instant Video has more than 1.2million while Sky has 10million viewers. A survey conducted by Netflix defined ‘binge-viewing’ as watching 2.3 episodes in one go. However many watch more than that. In one study a US student reported watching 49 episodes of Lost in two weeks – an average of 3.5 episodes per day.","Watching TV for long periods of time can lead to obesity and exhaustion .

"'Unacceptable': Chair of the public accounts committee Margaret Hodge (pictured) said: 'Every pound that is lost to fraud and corruption is a pound that could have been spent on educating a child' Millions of pounds of British aid money could be lost to crooks and fraudsters because of 'unacceptably poor' controls on corruption, MPs warn today. The Commons public accounts committee warns the Department for International Development (Dfid) needs to impose 'much tougher' scrutiny of money channelled through the private sector. MPs said they had heard evidence that millions of pounds was spent on projects with links to known fraudsters. They highlighted a £20 million investment in a power plant project in Ivory Coast, in which one company had alleged links to the notorious fraudster James Ibori, the former Wickes cashier who was jailed for 13 years in 2012 for a £50 million fraud. MPs also raised concerns about a £20 million investment in a gas plant in Nigeria, involving a company allegedly involved in 'looting Nigerian oil revenues'. The UK is the biggest donor to the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) - which was set up to invest in infrastructure projects in developing countries - with total support expected to reach £860 million by 2017. Today's report says the PIDG was beset by 'poor financial management', lavish travel spending, and doubts about the integrity of its investments. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: 'It is essential for public confidence in spending on overseas aid that Dfid is able to demonstrate that UK taxpayers' money is being used for its intended purpose - of helping the world's poorest people - and not ending up in the wrong hands. 'Every pound that is lost to fraud and corruption is a pound that could have been spent on educating a child, improving health systems or supporting economic development. 'We recognise that PIDG operates in countries where standards of governance can be challenging. However the department's oversight of PIDG has been unacceptably poor and has left it open to questions about the integrity of PIDG's investments and some of the companies with which it works.' A Dfid spokesman rejected the claims, saying there was 'absolutely no evidence' of wrongdoing linked to the companies involved in either the Ivory Coast or Nigeria projects. 'Britain's investment in the Private Infrastructure Development Group has helped to create 200,000 jobs and driven £6.8billion of private investment into some of the world's poorest countries, developing their economies and making them less dependent on aid,' the spokesman said. Investment: The Commons public accounts committee warns the Department for International Development (pictured, file photo) needs to impose 'much tougher' scrutiny of money channelled through the private sector . Warning: Committee chairman Margaret Hodge (pictured) said: 'It is essential for public confidence in spending on overseas aid that Dfid is able to demonstrate that UK taxpayers' money is being used for its intended purpose . 'We already have strong oversight of PIDG's activities and have recently clamped down on excessive travel rates. An independent review of their operations, backed by Britain, will ensure they continue to kick start growth in the developing world.' But critics said the report highlighted the folly of the Government's controversial target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain's income on aid, which has been blamed for rushed spending. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Another day, another tale of international aid being handed out without proper checks or oversight. It is becoming a familiar story and shows how ludicrous it is to put an arbitrary 0.7 per cent target on the statute book. The department must improve its handling of taxpayers' money and ensure that not a penny sent abroad is wasted or lost in the system.' Labour last night said it had 'grave concerns' about the way money was being spent with the private sector. Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: 'There's nothing wrong with working with the private sector. These are funds set up by a Labour government. My question is when you scale them up this quick without changes to governance and oversight (there is) concern about where and how the money is spent.'","MPs on the public accounts committee criticised poor foreign investment .

"Ivy League schools have started recruiting more economically diverse students from China after receiving multi-million dollar grants from public and private donors. Chinese billionaire real estate couple, Pan Shiyi and Zhang Xin, gifted $100 million to top U.S. universities last year- including $10 million to Yale and $15 million to Harvard - in a bid to help poor students from their home country. The State Department's EducationUSA program also created million-dollar funds to provide aid for overseas students to cover costs such as application fees and transportation to interviews. Financial aid: In this November 20, 2014 photo, Yupei Guo, top, greets friend Serene Silin Li at Yale University - she's one of the Chinese students who has benefited from college's refocused recruitment strategy . Commenting on the move, Evan Ryan, an assistant secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, said: 'The State Department thought, ""Wait, we're really losing a whole population of the students that are important to the U.S. higher education system and important to our relationships around the world.""' EducationUSA has eight advisers in Beijing and is sending four more to Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang this year to reach students beyond the capital. The agency has been important to recruiting, Yale officials say, because it makes referrals knowing the school has the resources to cover students' need. Yupei Guo is one student who has benefited from the 'refocused' recruitment strategy. She does not fit the mold of the traditional Ivy League student from China: Her journalist parents are neither rich nor members of the governing elite. Growing up, she thought the cost would make it impossible for her to attend one of the famed American universities. At Yale tuition, room and board cost nearly $60,000 a year. All walks of life: With more undergraduates coming from overseas than ever, some Ivy League universities are reaching out in new ways to attract international students of more varied backgrounds . Fitting in: Despite some uncomfortable questions about her background, Guo said she does not feel out of place at Yale, where the Chinese students are increasingly diverse with several freshmen from inland cities . But by the time she applied to the college, it was among the U.S. schools investing in more economic diversity among their growing ranks of international students. Guo, 19, is now a Yale sophomore, happily settled among the school's Gothic buildings. Most would never guess university grants cover much of the Beijing native's tuition, at least not judging by the questions she gets around New Haven. 'I did get asked if I were some sort of distant royal family member, which I'm not,' she said. Guo attended a selective public high school in Beijing and learned from upperclassmen the names of U.S. schools with need-blind admissions - Yale, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Dartmouth and Amherst. She visited Yale during high school - on a U.S. visit for model United Nations - and felt energized by the posters advertising campus activities. At home, her departure was met with a mix of admiration and scorn. Yale is a celebrated name in China, where her acceptance prompted calls from reporters. On trend: Nearly 275,000 students came from China last year, 31per cent of all international students, according to the Institute of International Education. But Guo said there is also a stigma that comes with attending college in the U.S., as though those leaving failed to fit into the Chinese system. And there is bitterness: Financial concerns prevent many of her friends from going to college at all. However, it's hoped that education abroad will become more accessible in the near future. The admissions directors at Yale and Harvard say the investment they have received will help create the diversity sought by students and faculty. 'We want to make sure that we get the most talented students from every corner of the world, and it's just that simple,' Harvard Dean of Admissions William Fitzsimmons said. Despite some uncomfortable questions about her background, Guo said she does not feel out of place at Yale, where the Chinese students are increasingly diverse with several freshmen coming from inland cities. 'This place,' she said, 'is amazing.'

"A porn video that a former student made in the stacks of the Oregon State University library is getting university administrators hot under the collar. Kendra Sunderland, 19, became the talk of campus when she posted a video on PornHub that showed her stripping out of her top and touching herself for 31 minutes in the crowded Valley Library in Corvallis, Oregon. The clip became a sensation on campus - passed around among students on social media. It was viewed more than 260,000 times in just a few days before PornHub took it down, KEZI-TV reports. Scroll down for video . Kendra Sunderland, 19, was arrested and charged with public indecency after she posted a 31-minute porn video she made in the Valley Library at Oregon State University . Many students expressed shock that she was able to perform so long in the crowded library without anyone noticing . University administrators were furious that a a former used the Oregon State campus to film a porn video . This week, the Oregon State Police arrested Sunderland on a charge of public indecency. She was cited and released. Some students were dismayed at the infamy Sunderland brought to campus. Others were amused. Many, though, were surprised she was able to get away with filming a porn in the crowded library for half an hour without being caught by anyone. 'I feel like it’s always packed. I don’t know how anyone could get away with it,' student Shelby Wilson told KEZI. University spokesman Steven Clark said monitors patrol the campus library - but they can't be everywhere at once. 'Imagine six floors; 340,000 square feet. It’s used by 30,000 people on average every week,' he told KEZI. Sunderland joins a long list of college students who have taken educational detours into porn. Most famous is perhaps Belle Knox, the Duke University student who says she started doing porn to pay her tuition. Florida State University student Mia Khalifa recently made headlines for revealing she has gotten death threats in her native Lebanon for her porn career.

"It was an ordinary hunting day in Texas earlier this month until two friends spotted a wild hog weighing nearly 800 pounds. Blaine Garcia and Wyatt Walton were on a ranch in De Leon, owned by Comanche County Commissioner Jimmy Dale Johnson, when they discovered the large hog and embarked on a mission along with two hunting bulldogs to catch the wild beast. The hog nicknamed 'Boarzilla' is currently receiving around the clock care until its fate is decided. Garcia started off his day alone but when he saw signs of the giant swine he called his friend Wyatt who was in a neighboring town and asked him for his help. Big catch: Blaine Garcia (left) and Wyatt Walton (right) pose with the 790 pound hog they caught in Texas . 'I did a double take. I couldn’t believe his size, and he took off running down a draw. I tried to walk up and get a better look but he kept running off as I approached,' Garcia told The Flash Today. Garcia is a long time hog hunter but up until January 16, the largest hog he ever caught was 450 pounds, a little more than half the size of the 790 pound hog. 'I got on the phone and called my friend Wyatt Walton, who was in Cross Plains, and told him what I had found, ‘Garcia said. 'Once he arrived on location we began to work a 20-acre area with two catch dogs.' Garcia started looking for the pig in a ravine and Walton sniffed around another part of the property. As Garcia got further down into the ravine he noticed the pig made mud wallows the size of bathtubs. Garcia and his dog immediately sensed the distinct smell of wild boar hog. 'My dog started whining and wanted to be let loose,' Garcia said. All tied up: The hog was not killed, rather the hunters tied it up so that it could not move and transported it to cattle coral where it is currently being cared for around the clock . The muscle: Walton held dog the hog as Garcia ran to his truck to drive it closer to the hunting area so they could get the materials needed to hold the massive creature . 'There was the distinct smell of wild boar hog and you could smell it even more as we began to work up a brushy hill. When I had almost topped it I could see him moving toward us and around, so we got by a big oak tree and kind of hid behind it.' Garcia and his dog hid behind the tree until the animal was 10 yards away. Garcia let his dog loose and he attempted to get the hog on the ear but the hog was so large that the dog was only to grasp onto its jaw. The dog continued to bite at the gargantuan pig who squealed as he tried to escape the dog's pointy teeth. 'The pig was really squealing and running around in circles and I’m hollering for Wyatt to come running, and he’s probably about 400 yards away,' the hunter added. 'The hog is trying to get down the hill and rake off my dog, but Wyatt and his dog got there just in time.' Personal record: Up until January 16 the biggest hog that Blaine Garcia ever captured was only 450 pounds . Wyatt heard his friends excited cries and rushed to his location. The hog was so large, Wyatt said the dog looked like the dog was a piece of jewelry hanging from the big pig. 'When I first saw him, Blaine’s dog looked like an earring or some kind of jewelry hanging off the hog’s head, but it really wasn’t until we got ahold of the hog that I realized how big and powerful this animal was,' Walton said. 'We’ve tied hundreds of hogs and there has never been anything like this boar.' The hog was so massive the men struggled to grab one of its legs and they were eventually able to flip it onto its side. Walton held dog the hog as Garcia ran to his truck to drive it closer to the hunting area. They used ratchet straps to tie and bind the hog until it couldn’t struggle any more. 'He was incredibly strong; we had three legs tied together and he still tried to stand up,' Garcia said. 'Together, Wyatt and I probably weigh a little over 430 pounds; it was like we weighed nothing.' The men were so tired from capturing the hog they thought they might become ill. The prize: Once the hunters got the hog tied, they called upon hunter Zach Ryon and Ray Chupp and a 2500-pound winch to hoist the hog onto a trailer . 'We were so tired I thought we were going to puke,' Garcia laughed. 'There was no way we were going to be able to get him onto a trailer by ourselves – we were so tired.' Once the men got the hog tied, they called upon hunter Zach Ryon and Ray Chupp and a 2500-pound winch to hoist the hog onto a trailer. They then shipped the hog to a temporary home called cattle coral. Garcia and Walton aren’t sure of the future of the hog but for the time being it is receiving 24-hour care. 'We may end up doing that (selling the hog) in the future, but for right now, we’re undecided on what we’re going to do,' he said. 'It’s something that maybe we’re going to think on for a little bit.' Garcia said that he and Wyatt hunt as both a hobby and a business. They recently started a business called Boar Collector Feral Hog Removal to control the large amount of feral hogs in Texas. Over 2.6 million hogs roam around Texas and can damage crops and fields. The damage is so bad that Texas Parks and Wildlife and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has looked into using bacon preservative to poison feral hogs and started a yearly 'Hog Out Month' in October that puts no limits on hog hunting.","Blaine Garcia and Wyatt Walton captured a 790 pound feral hog earlier this month with the help of two bulldogs .

"In most families, dinner table conversation is restricted to what happened at school or whether homework has been completed. But Michael Lisanti asked his eight-year-old daughter how she would cure cancer, and it seems she may have got it right. Camilla Lisanti suggested using antibiotics, ‘like when I have a sore throat’. Her parents, a husband-wife cancer research team were sceptical at first but tested out her theory in their Manchester University lab. And to their surprise, several cheap and widely-used antibiotics killed the most dangerous cancer cells. Scroll down for video . Michael Lisanti and his wife, a team of cancer doctors, tried using antibiotics such as those found in acne treatments to treat common cancers after their daughter Camilla suggested it at the dinner table . The antibiotics fought seven of the most common cancers – including breast, prostate, lung and hard-to-treat brain tumours. One antibiotic, doxycycline, is widely used to treat acne and is thought to be particularly promising. It costs as little as 6p a day. In contrast, some of the latest cancer drugs cost several hundred pounds a day. Cancer charities said the research shows that the answers to some of the biggest questions are right in front of our eyes. Professor Lisanti and his wife, Federica Sotgia, were discussing their research over dinner one evening when they decided to ask their daughter for her opinion. The professor said: ‘She has heard us talk about cancer a lot and we thought it would be fun to ask her what she thought about cancer therapy. ‘We asked her how she would cure cancer and she said “Mum and Dad, I would just use an antibiotic, like when I have a sore throat.’ Rather than completely dismissing the answer, the professor did a DIY experiment, rubbing an antibiotic cream on a small growth on his face. When the growth disappeared, he did some reading that confirmed that Camilla may have been on to something. Seven of the most common cancers, such as breast, prostate (pictured), and hard-to-treat brain tumours, were slowed by the drugs which stopped them producing mitochondria which they use to reproduce . Unknown to Camilla, a bubbly bilingual child who wants to be a teacher, some antibiotics stop cell from making mitochondria, the tiny engine rooms that supply them with energy. Camilla’s parents showed that cancer stem cells – the deadly ‘mother cells’ that give birth to tumours, keep them alive and ease their spread around the body – have particularly high numbers of mitochondria. They also showed that four common antibiotics killed these stem cells in samples taken from breast, prostate, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, skin and brain cancers. Importantly, healthy cells were not harmed. The experiments on cells in a dish suggest that antibiotics could be used to stop cancer in its tracks and prevent it from spreading through the body – the main way it kills. Professor Lisanti says that antibiotics could prove to be an inexpensive and safe one-size-fits-all treatment for cancer. He now needs funding to test his theory on people, including women with breast cancer. Researchers say the results are promising and Mr Lisanti is now seeking funding to try the treatment on humans (file image) If they are shown to fight the disease, they could potentially also be used to prevent the cancer in those at high risk of developing it. Several previous studies support Camilla’s idea. This includes one in which lung cancer patients lived longer after being given an antibiotic to treat an infection they had. Some 75 per cent lived for at least a year – up from the usual 45 per cent. In another study, tumours completely disappeared after just three weeks of taking doxycycline for an infection. Cancer Research UK cautioned that Professor Lisanti’s work was done in the lab and doesn’t tell us whether antibiotics will work on people with cancer. But Breakthrough Breast Cancer, which helped fund the research, is much more optimistic . Dr Matthew Lam, the charity’s senior research officer, said: ‘The conclusions the researchers have drawn, while just hypotheses at this stage, are certainly interesting. ‘Antibiotics are cheap and readily available and if in time the link between their use and the eradication of cancer stem cells can be proved, this work may be the first step towards a new avenue for cancer treatment. ‘This is a perfect example of why it is so important to continue to invest in scientific research. ‘Sometimes there are answers to some of the biggest questions right in front of us. But without ongoing commitment to the search for these answers, we’d never find them.’ Camilla’s parents have acknowledged her contribution to their research by naming her as an author of their study, which is published in the journal Oncotarget. Her father said the story emphasises the importance of listening to what your children say. Professor Lisanti said: ‘I thought it was very naïve to think you could cure cancer with antibiotics but at the end of the day Camilla was right. ‘She usually is right about things. She always has a snappy answer that makes sense. ‘I think she will become a diplomat or a lawyer, someone who has to think on their feet.’","Michael Lisanti asked daughter Camilla how she would treat cancers .

"A woman jailed for helping her killer husband dispose of their dead babysitter’s body wept as she told a parole board that she’s sorry for what she did and hopes that ‘being in hell helps’. The victim’s mom was at the hearing but said later that she thought the board was being lied to. Dea Millerberg, 41, was jailed for five years for helping her white supremacist husband Eric Millerberg bury the body of 16-year-old Utah girl Alexis Rasmussen after a night of babysitting spiralled into a sex and drug-fueled tragedy. Dea Millerberg, 41, was jailed for five years for helping her white supremacist husband Eric Millerberg bury the body of 16-year-old Utah girl Alexis Rasmussen after baby-sitting turned into a night of sex and drugs. She is pictured in a tearful parole board hearing that took place this week . Dea told a parole hearing in Utah that she struggled daily with what she'd done . Eric Millerberg was sentenced to life for child abuse homicide after Alexis Rasmussen's death  - a first-degree felony - and one to 15 years for obstructing justice, a second-degree felony . Eric Millerberg drastically cleaned up his look when his trial began in 2014 . Prosecutors said the Millerbergs gave the teen drugs in exchange for babysitting services, and the three had a drug-fueled sexual relationship that led to Rasmussen's death from an overdose in 2011. Eric was found to have recklessly injected Rasmussen with lethal doses of heroin and methamphetamine. Eric and Dea then dumped Alexis's body in the woods of northern Utah while lying to police as the girl's mother desperately searched for her for more than a month. Dea tearfully told the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole this week that she was sorry for what she had done, Ksl.com reported. She said: ‘I’m so sorry. It does hurt me to know I caused so much pain and anguish and hurt and anger. I feel like I do deserve to be here. I struggle daily with what I did. The longer I've been off drugs, the harder it is. ‘I hope my being here, somehow, helps in some way.’ A parole officer told her that she should be prepared to serve the full prison term. Alexis’s mom, Dawn Miera, refused to believe that Dea was being sincere. Tragic: Alexis Rasmussen's body was found stuffed into a garbage bag on a Utah mountain in 2011 . She questioned why Dea didn’t help her find her daughter when she was reported missing. She said: ‘I don't know if she really feels sorry. I don't know if this is really about her. I don't know if I can believe anything that she says.’ Eric Millerberg was sentenced to life for child abuse homicide - a first-degree felony and one to 15 years for obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He was also sentenced to two terms of zero to five years for the unlawful and statutory rape of a 16-or-17-year-old - and abuse or desecration of a human body, third-degree felonies. The sentences are consecutive. Eric Millerberg, 38, showed no sign of emotion when the judge sentenced him in 2014. After Alexis died, Eric and Dea grabbed her body, stuffed it in to a trash bag, bundled it in the trunk of their car and dumped it in a remote rural location. The body was found 38 days later. Dea said the couple started using Alexis - or Lexi as she called her - as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011. Alexis's body was found here in Morgan County six weeks after her death . According to Salt Lake Tribune, Dea testified that on the night of the girl's death, she had picked up Alexis to babysit her kids. She said as soon as Alexis arrived at the house, Eric Millerberg helped her get high by injecting her with drugs - once with heroin and twice with meth - into her arm and neck. Then, when she was ‘as high as she had ever been’, the girl and Eric Millerberg performed oral sex on one another. Dea said that she was not involved in the encounter. A short while later, the drugs had a negative effect on the teen and she started ‘freaking out’. She reportedly felt disoriented and cold, so she asked if she could take a warm bath in the couple’s master bathroom. After leaving her alone in the bath at her request, the Millerbergs checked on her about 45 minutes later to find that she was still cold, so Dea wrapped her in a blanket and told her to lie down in another bedroom. The couple left her to smoke cigarettes, and returned about a half hour later to find her unresponsive. ‘She wasn't breathing. She had mucousy stuff coming out of the right side of her mouth,’ said Dea, who was a licensed nurse and tried to resuscitate the girl to no avail. They then tried to figure out what to do next. ‘It really was a panic. The idea of it was, we will lose our kids and go to jail, and there was nothing we could do to bring her back,’ she told the court. Eric Millerberg was on parole at the time for burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang. The girl was found  in a fetal position, her lower half stuffed into a garbage bag. Utah assistant medical examiner Joseph White testified that the girl’s body was so badly decomposed, it was difficult to identify her. Dental records and a fingerprint analysis finally led to a positive identification. A toxicologist testified that reports showed she had ingested meth at least 24 hours before her death.","Dea Millerberg was jailed for helping to dispose of a teenager's body .

"A waiter who dreamt he would win the Lottery the day before he bought a winning £1million ticket will keep half of the jackpot after his boss's bid to get the lot fell through in court. Fatih Ozcan envisaged himself holding bundles of cash as his restaurant's manager Hayati Kucukkoylu stood in front of him. The next day Mr Ozcan shared his premonition with his boss and Mr Kucukkoylu gave him money from the till to buy a Euromillions ticket, with the pair winning the Millionaire Raffle and getting their hands on £1million. But the young waiter's dream turned into a nightmare when his boss declared that all the winnings should be his, as the money used to purchase the ticket came from his till. Waiter Fatih Ozcan (right) and restaurant boss Hayati Kucukkoylu (left) will share a £1million Lottery jackpot after a legal wrangle over the jackpot . Despite having a party at the restaurant to celebrate the win in January 2012, Mr Kucukkoylu claimed he had paid for the £9 ticket and chosen the numbers and was therefore owed the full winnings. The war of words ended up in court, with a judge ruling last year that the cash should be split 50/50. Mr Ozcan persuaded his boss to donate money from the restaurant till towards the ticket - as he felt that if the two joined forces they would win. But the waiter claimed he had paid half the stake and contributed to the number choice - and was therefore due a share of the cash. Ruling on the case, Judge Mark Gosnell said Mr Ozcan 'had a dream' on the night of January 29, 2012. 'He dreamt that he was holding a large bundle of cash and, standing in front of him, was his boss. 'Mr Ozcan is a strong believer in the power of dreams and interpreted this to mean that he and Mr Kucukkoylu would win the lottery,' he said. The next day, Mr Ozcan 'pestered' his boss for several hours before he relented and passed him coins from the restaurant's till to towards the ticket. The pair won £1million on the Euromillions draw after clubbing together to buy a ticket in January 2012 . The inspired waiter who went to a nearby supermarket and bought the ticket which yielded the riches, the court heard. But Mr Kucukkoylu, 47, who runs the Kapadokya Turkish restaurant in York, said he paid the entire stake and had chosen the winning numbers, claiming the winnings should be his. Mr Ozcan was adamant that it was his dream that prompted the win, that he had paid half the £9 stake and that some of the number choices were his. He later complained to police, alleging Mr Kucukkoylu had 'stolen his winning Lottery ticket from his jacket pocket'. He told Lottery operators Camelot the same story - and Mr Kucukkoylu was arrested and held for nine hours before he was eventually released without charge. Mr Ozcan later admitted making the bogus allegation because he wanted to stop his boss from 'getting his hands' on the cash and 'sending it back to Turkey'. Last year Judge Gosnell found that the men each played an equal part in the win and that each had paid half the stake. Both judges viewed a series of increasingly angry texts between the pair and CCTV footage of events in the restaurant as the winning slips were filled in. The footage strongly suggested that both men had shared the task of choosing the winning numbers and that each had paid half of the £9 stake. The judge concluded: 'I find that the effect of these conversations was that Mr Kucukkoylu and Mr Ozcan entered into a contract to jointly play the lottery on an equal basis. 'There should be a declaration that the prize money from this winning lottery ticket should be shared equally between Mr Kucukkoylu and Mr Ozcan.' However Mr Kucukkoylu disagreed with the ruling and appealed, saying that he deserved the full £1million. Mr Kucukkoylu's barrister, Mark Cannon QC, argued at the appeal hearing yesterday that Judge Gosnell 'failed to understand the significance' of the text messages. Court battle: A judge ruled that they should split the cash 50/50, with Mr Kucukkoylu appealing the decision . Dispute: An appeal judge ruled the pair, who worked at Kapadokya (pictured) restaurant in York, must split the cash 50/50, with each man taking home £500,000 . But Lord Justice Pitchford said: 'In my view, this argument has no real prospect of success. 'The judge acknowledged that the weight of the texts appeared to support Mr Kucukkoylu's case and Mr Ozcan's explanation of them depended on the judge's conclusion as to the nature of the relationship between them. 'Rightly, in my view, the judge concluded, in the end, that the texts were equivocal. 'He assessed that he had to rely on other factors to determine whether the ticket was purchased jointly. 'This led him to prefer the evidence of Mr Ozcan on a number of significant issues, including the texts. There is no reasonable argument that the judge misunderstood the importance of the text evidence. 'The conclusions he reached were properly open to him and I see no real prospect of the Court of Appeal reaching a different conclusion. For that reason, the application must be dismissed,' Lord Justice Pitchford ruled that the money should be split 50/50 between the pair.","Waiter Fatih Ozcan had a dream he would win the Lottery with his boss .

"How this lost reindeer must have longed for a shiny red nose. For the runaway deer appeared startled as it weaved through traffic while prancing around the dark streets of Kent early this morning.

"A Massachusetts State Police trooper broke down in tears on the witness stand Thursday while describing the fatal injuries suffered by a 24-year-old math teacher allegedly killed by her student. Former Danvers High School freshman Philip Chism, now 16 years old, is being tried as an adult for the savage 2013 rape and murder of his teacher, Colleen Ritzer. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder and aggravated rape. Scroll down for video . In tears: Massachusetts State Police Trooper Steven Buccheri (left) became emotional when asked to describe Colleen Ritzer's injuries, allegedly inflicted by her student, then-14-year-old Philip Chism (right) The trooper also told the court that Chism led police to Ritzer's body in the woods . Prosecutors allege Chism, then 14, raped the 24-year-old woman with a stick, repeatedly stabbed her and then disposed of her body by stuffing it inside a recycling bin and dumping it in the woods by the school on October 22, 2013. Thursday marked Day 3 of testimony at a motion to suppress hearing, which got under way back on January 9. State Police Trooper Steven Buccheri became visibly emotional when asked to describe for the court the extent of Miss Ritzer's injuries, reported the Boston Globe. The law enforcement official’s voice broke and he was seen wiping his eyes on the stand when asked how many wounds had been inflicted to Colleen Ritzer's neck. 'Sixteen,' Buccheri replied with a heavy sigh. The trooper also told the court that Chism led police to Ritzer's body in the woods. The teenager's defense team have been pushing to have his alleged confession to the crime, the transcript and the video recording of his interview thrown out of court. Chism's lawyers argue that their client never waved his Miranda rights and invoked his right to remain silent in his initial encounters with police. They also claim that investigators pressured his mother to get him to talk to the cops. Closing arguments in the motion to suppress hearing will be heard Monday, after which a judge will make a determination regarding the evidence in the case. Earlier this month, Detective Sergeant Phil Tansey from Danvers, Massachusetts, police told a jury at Essex Superior Court how Philip Chism described the details of Collen Rizter's grisly death after he was arrested in October 2013. Chism, 16, (pictured during an appearance at Essex Superior Court earlier this month) told detectives he killed teacher Collen Ritzer with a box cutter by slicing it across a neck, a court has heard . The youngster, who was 14 at the time, allegedly helped investigators recover the body by pointing to the spot on a map of woods behind Danvers High School where he dumped her corpse. Tansey told the court that Chism confessed to murdering the popular 24-year-old during police interviews, but denied sexually assaulting her with a stick which was found near her body. Authorities say surveillance video from October 22, 2013, shows Chism following Ritzer into a bathroom in Danvers High School, wearing gloves and a hood, then later walking out of the bathroom alone. Tansey's  statements came as Chism's lawyers look to throw out confessions and other evidence seized from him the night he was detained tossed out as evidence before trial. A short time later, the video shows Chism pulling a recycling barrel through the school and outside. Ritzer's body was later found in nearby woods, naked from the waist down and with her throat slit and a note that read, 'I hate you all.' A recycling barrel was found near Ritzer's body. Authorities said she was sexually assaulted with a stick. On January 16, prosecutors called on State Police Detective Lt. Norman Zuk, who testified that Chism said a 'trigger word' had set him off before the murder. Zuk did not say what that word was. Defense lawyers, meanwhile, called on Dr. Thomas Grisso, a retired University of Massachusetts professor and expert in juvenile psychiatry. He testified about the ability of juveniles to understand the implications of waiving their right to not speak with police. Allegations: The court heard that Chism (pictured in early January) helped authorities locate her body by pointing at a map of the woods behind Danvers High School in Massachusetts. However he has denied sexually assaulting her with a stick . Defense lawyers say Chism was detained by police for more than three hours after he was picked up around 12.30am October 23. They say he had been handcuffed for most of the time, was not allowed to make a phone call and had asked a number of times for food. Chism's lawyers say police coerced his mother, Diana, to get her then-14-year-old son into waiving his rights and making detailed statements about the murder, including how he knocked Ritzer out with a 'karate chop' before slicing her neck two times with a box cutter. Prosecutors maintain Chism, who had recently moved to Massachusetts from Clarksville, Tennessee, and his mother never absolutely invoked their right to a lawyer. At a recent hearing, prosecutors played audio from Diana Chism's interview with police. The mother said her son was 'capable of snapping' under the recent stress of his parents' separation and that his family had a history of mental health issues. Two local police officers also testified they found Chism carrying Ritzer's ID and credit cards, a bloody box cutter and women's underwear. Chism told the officers a woman was 'buried in the woods' and could not be helped.","Philip Chism, now 16, helped investigators locate Colleen Ritzer's body after her death in October 2013 .

"Whether you are grabbing a takeaway coffee, or flicking through a magazine, it is almost impossible not to encounter adverts or brands. But a prototype headset that can block out brands has been created, meaning that people may be able to ‘opt out of corporate influence’ in the future. A group of four students developed the device during a hackathon, to help people who ‘feel helpless against the dominance of ads in society today.’ Scroll down for video . A prototype headset that can block out brands has been created, meaning that people may be able to ‘opt out of corporate influence’ in the future. The 'Adblock for Real Life' can be seen blurring out the logo on a coffee cup (left) while the image on the right doesn't have the feature switched on . The headset is called ‘Brand Killer: Adblock for Real Life’ and comprises a pair of goggles with a seven inch display inside and a camera, running on Open CV and Python software.

Once any of the recognisable brands come into view, the system pixelates them. ‘It’s Adblock for real life,’ the team of computer scientists said. The headset cost $80 (£53) and was built over one weekend. Despite a positive response to an ad-free world, its creators say there are no plans to use or sell the gadget. Team member Alex Crits-Christoph, a Biophysics student at Johns Hopkins University, said: ‘This idea was inspired by the British TV show Black Mirror, in which one episode features a future in which certain people are literally blocked out from the lives of others using augmented reality technology.’ The team decided to use a similar idea to empower people and let them block out advertising, which Mr Crits-Christoph described as ‘an eyesore and overwhelmingly present in society today’. They originally set out to overlay brands with generic labels such as ‘soda’ instead of ‘Dr Pepper,’ for example but ran out of time, as they built the headset over one weekend and only spent $80 (£53). ‘We also planned to target billboards and full-adverts, but also did not finish that in the competition.’ The team also considered replacing adverts with artwork. While the headset was only developed to demonstrate the potential of current technology in augmented reality, it was received positively by people keen to block out adverts from their lives. Mr Crits-Christoph said:‘Around 30 people tried the headset on when we demoed it at PennApps, and almost every one smiled or laughed at the effect. ‘The positive response from the Internet has been wonderful.’ There are no plans to sell or use the headset (pictured) in day-to-day life.

This image shows a blurred bottle, left and original, right . ‘I think that currently people feel helpless against the dominance of ads in society today. ‘Possibly the response to the project has been so overwhelming because it has helped people imagine a world in which technology like this is used to empower individuals as one that is not too far off.’ Team member Jonathan Dubin told MailOnline: ‘The response to our technology indicates that people really identify with the goal of blocking ads in the real world. ‘I think many people have realised that brands are everywhere in our world, and the ability to exert some control over our surroundings rather than be helpless to the ads is empowering.’ ‘People have been looking for practical uses of augmented reality, and I think that this, or variations of it, could be highly demanded. ‘People want the same freedom they have in their browsers, in the real world.’ Despite this, there are no plans to sell or use the headset in day-to-day life.

'Uh, uh, uh...': Rambling drink driver Christopher Squires gave an unconvincing account of how his VW Polo was smashed up on a country road - insisting the  windscreen was 'old damage' and he was doing a U-turn . Squires said: 'It's an old thingy, it's not a new thingy, it's not a new injury, this is an old thing like, simple as that like, it's an old thingy, it's an old injury to the car, it's not a new one that's it... I'm not drunk' A member of the public found Squires behind the wheel of his VW Polo after it flipped and came to rest the right way up at 1.40am on December 24. He was on a rural road on the South Downs near Fenhurst, West Sussex - five miles from his home in the village of Lodsworth. Police were alerted and breathalysed him after the short filmed conversation. They quickly found he was more than twice the drink drive limit. When an officer arrived and asked  if he was injured, Squires said: 'No I'm fine, ehm the car's quite a bit [he mumbles a lot] not a problem mate, sorry. 'I was trying to turn it round that's all, like, there's nothing. Obviously it's messed up but yeah, no, there's no problem mate, so I put the handbrake on, yeah, no, it's a bit like, there's no damage at all really.

"Two sisters handed a £110,000 windfall after their father's death have been forced to pay it all back and more - after an insurance company sent them the wrong man's money.

The sisters had spent years in vain trying to get the pension for their father after he retired at the age of 65 in 2008. They had still not managed to track it down by the time he died three years later but vowed to continue looking for it in his memory. So they were overjoyed when Friends Life sent the cheque to their solicitors in October 2013. But within a month their joy turned to horror when Friends Life announced they had given them the pension belonging to another customer with the same name. Ordeal: After spending much of the sum, the sisters were horrified to learn of the mistake and struggled to repay the total. They were recently forced to pay Friends Life £7,000 on top of the full amount paid back . Two months later the pensions and insurance firm threatened the sisters with legal action unless they handed it all back. The devastated pair were forced to sell their father's house - which they planned to keep as an investment - to repay the money they had spent. They also had to borrow from friends and other relatives to make up the full amount of £108,895 and paid it all back within a year, by last October. But Friends Life took them to court earlier this month and obtained an order to get even more from them - £6,000 in costs plus £1,000 in interest. Sad sacrifice: The sisters were forced to sell their father's house (pictured) - which they planned to keep as an investment - to repay the money they had spent . The company admitted making an error but said they were forced to launch legal action because the executors told them the money had been distributed and would not be repaid and the parties could not settle the matter amicably. Mother-of-two Ms Millington, 45, a teaching assistant from Stockton, Teeside, said: 'It has just caused us untold issues and heartache. September 2008: Elaine Briscoe and Sandy Millington's father, Robert Gent, retires from grave-digging and the sisters attempt to track his pension fund. 2011: Robert Gent dies and Ms Briscoe and Ms Millington have still not been able to obtain money they believe is owed to their father as part of a pension plan. October 2013: The sisters are overjoyed when a letter arrives from Friends Life informing them that they are owed £108,000 in their father's name. October 2013: The sisters immediately distribute £40,000 between Mr Gent's four grandchildren, as he had wished, and spend around £20,000 themselves. November 2013: Friends Life contact Ms Briscoe and Ms Millington to inform them that a mistake was made and that a different customer of the same name was actually owed the £108,000. They are ordered to repay the money. October 2014: After desperately borrowing money from friends and relatives and selling their late father's house, they manage to pay the sum back to Friends Life. January 2015: The sisters are taken to court and ordered to pay Friends Life £6,000 in costs and £1,000 interest. 'It has been horrendous and caused arguments within the family.' She added: 'We got quoted a point of law which says that no one should gain from a mistake, which we accept, but surely no one should have to pay for one either. 'We feel like Friends Life Group just did not want to listen to us. We did our best to get back the money as quickly as possible but it takes time. 'It feels as if they did not believe that we were trying our best to sort it out, it was extremely stressful and some people have stopped talking to us.' Ms Briscoe, 48, who also has two children, from Newham Grange, Middlesborough, said: 'We don't care about the money, it's about the injustice. 'After three years of looking for dad's pension, we finally thought we had found it - although it was too late for him to enjoy. 'We thought it was all behind us but then we got the letter and it was like a bad dream. We just could not believe what we were reading.' Friends Life Group said: 'In October 2013 a significant overpayment was made to the executors of Mr Gent's estate on a claim. 'This was a result of human error. 'In November 2013, having established that this error had occurred, we contacted the executors' solicitors to explain the situation, offer our apologies for the distress caused by the mistake, and to request repayment of the money that had been paid out through our error. 'We understand that requesting repayment of such a significant sum of money at a difficult time may have been upsetting for the family and we sincerely apologise for any distress caused. 'Given that the error had been discovered within a month and that the estate in question appeared to be of significant value, it was hoped that the matter could be rectified with the minimum inconvenience and distress. Windfall: A letter dates October 2013 informs the sisters that they are owed more than £100,000 as part of an insurance policy . 'In response to our request for repayment of the money that had been paid out by mistake, the executors advised that the estate had already been distributed, and that accordingly the money would not be repaid. 'As per our standard procedures, we instructed our solicitors to take up the case on our behalf. 'Having failed to negotiate a settlement, we commenced legal proceedings, as a last resort. 'The main proceedings were concluded when the executors paid the full sum claimed. 'In January 2015 the court ordered that the executors make a further payment to cover a portion of the costs we incurred.' One month later: Another letter from Friends Life breaks the news to them that an administrative error was made and that they must pay back the full amount . They added: 'We offer our unreserved apologies for the initial overpayment error and the subsequent distress this caused. 'It is regrettable that we were not able to resolve the situation amicably. 'Given the substantial nature of the overpayment, seeking repayment of the funds as per standard industry practice was necessary. 'We appreciate that financial matters of this nature require sensitive handling, which is why we only ever take legal action as a last resort.'","Elaine Briscoe and Sandy Millington ecstatic when insurance letter arrived .
Friends Life informed the sisters they were owed almost £110,000 .
Pair had been battling to recover late father's pension fund for five years .
Sisters, from Middlesbrough, immediately spent and distributed money .

"Internationally renowned Australian author Colleen McCullough has died at the age of 77 after an impressive 40 years of writing. McCullough, best loved for her immensely popular novel The Thorn Birds, died in Norfolk Island Hospital on Thursday afternoon after enduring a string of health problems. The best-selling author penned 24 novels and a biography, earning McCullough a global reputation and inspiring a portrait that was a finalist for the 2007 Archibald Prize. Australian author Colleen McCullough has died aged 77, on Norfolk Island . McCullough was born in Wellington, NSW, and worked as a teacher, librarian, and journalist before entering the field of medicine and working as a neuroscientist in the United States. She studied neurophysiology at the University of Sydney, and would go on to establish a department for the field at the university, running it for five years, reported The Australian. Her work was of such a high calibre that she was invited to run the research laboratory in the medical school at Yale University. After the publication of The Thorn Birds in 1977, McCullough turned to writing fulltime, moving to the isolated Norfolk Island, where she met and married her husband Ric Robinson. The success of The Thorn Birds, whose book rights were worth a cool $1.9 million for the paperback alone, evolved into a mini-series adaptation of the novel starring Richard Chamberlain, Bryan Brown and Rachel Ward. The author has penned 24 novels and a biography over her 40-year writing career . Before turning to writing full-time, McCullough worked as a librarian, teacher, and journalist . Colleen McCullough's The Thorn Birds was made into a mini series after selling 30 million copies . The novel, which sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, is set on a sheep station in the Australian outback, and details the struggle of a young priest who is torn between his desire for the woman he loves and his clerical calling. Mel Gibson and Piper Laurie starred in a film adaptation of another of McCullough's books, Tim. McCullough also wrote many other well-known books including An Indecent Obsession, Morgan's Run, The Touch, and the Masters of Rome series. The series, which involved extensive research, won her praise from ancient history scholars and book lovers alike. 'Nobody had ever written a big book about Caesar, ever,' she told news.com.au at the time of it's publication. McCullough's first novel, Tim, was made into a movie starring Australian actor Mel Gibson . McCullough at a book signing in Canada after enjoying immense success with her novels . 'I soon found out why, because the research was so fearsome. I thought, oh, good,' McCullough said. In 2000 she was awarded the Scanno Prize for literature in Italy, despite some literary critics panning her accessible books as low-brow writing. Her 2008 novel The Independence of Miss Mary Bennett was a reinterpretation of Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice, garnering controversy among some literary circles. The president of the Jane Austen Society of Australia, Susannah Fullerton, said that McCullough's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett as weak, and Mr Darcy as 'savage' made her 'shudder'. McCullough published her final novel, Bittersweet, which was set in the 1920's and 30's, in 2013. HarperCollins publishing director Shona Martyn said that McCullough was a 'less colourful place' without her. 'Ever quick-witted and direct, we looked forward to her visits from Norfolk Island and the arrival of each new manuscript delivered in hard copy in custom-made maroon manuscript boxes inscribed with her name,' Ms Martyn told SBS.","The NSW-born author was best known for her work The Thorn Birds .

"The 16-year-old boy who murdered popular teacher Ann Maguire has lost a challenge to his 20-year minimum term. William Cornick stabbed Mrs Maguire, 61, seven times from behind as she taught a Spanish class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April last year. He was 15 at the time of the killing. Sentencing Cornick in November, Mr Justice Coulson told him that he must serve at least 20 years before he is eligible to seek parole but warned him: 'It's quite possible that day may never come.' His lawyer, Richard Wright QC, had asked the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, Lady Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Globe to reduce his minimum sentence. Scroll down for video . Killer: William Cornick (left) was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 20 years at Leeds Crown Court after he admitted murdering teacher Ann Maguire (right). His appeal was rejected in London today . But today, the panel of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London, headed by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, rejected Cornick's appeal against the minimum term. They said that based on the 'disturbing' facts of the case, the sentencing judge came to 'entirely the right decision'. At his hearing last year, Leeds Crown Court heard Cornick sent a Facebook message weeks before the killing, which said of Mrs Maguire: 'The one absolute f****** b***h that deserves more than death, more than pain and more than anything that we can understand.' He later told a psychiatrist: 'I wasn't in shock, I was happy. I had a sense of pride. I still do.' The boy also said after the killing that he thought everything he had done was 'fine and dandy'. Mrs Maguire had taught there for more than 40 years and was due to retire that September. Handing him a life sentence in November, Mr Justice Coulson said he showed a 'chilling lack of remorse' over the attack that saw him chase Mrs Maguire, 'stabbing her as she sought to escape'. He set the 20-year tariff - the minimum time Cornick must serve in custody before he is released - but added that, after reading about him, 'it's quite possible that day may never come'. Distraught: Mrs Maguire's widower, Don, pictured arriving at court today with daughters Emma (left) and Kerry, earlier described the killing as a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' Cornick dramatically pleaded guilty earlier, on the day he was due to stand trial for her killing. The court was also told how Cornick had brought a bottle of whisky to school to celebrate after the attack, and had winked at a fellow pupil before starting to stab Mrs Maguire. Cornick was said to have had a good family background with 'decent and responsible parents' - but wanted to be caught and jailed to avoid future worries about life and money. Mr Wright said the sentence was too severe, on the ground of 'youth, and plea'. 'The general complaint is that 20 years for a 16-year-old, 15 when he committed the offence, is simply too long'. Mr Wright said his client was of good character. Scene: The classroom at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds where Mrs Maguire was stabbed in April . He justified a delay in Cornick entering a guilty plea as being down to considerations of his mental health. The sentencing was also condemned by youth campaigners, pointing out that he would be in prison for longer than he has been alive. Paul Greaney QC, said Cornick could not be described as being of 'good character', as he had 'fantasised about the murder of Mrs Maguire since he was 12 or 13'. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, rejected the appeal, saying the killer had developed a strange 'hatred of Spanish lessons and Mrs Maguire, his Spanish teacher'. Remembered: Tributes left in memory of Mrs Maguire outside Corpus Christi Catholic College last November . 'He told more than one pupil that he hated her and wanted her dead,' the judge said. The Lord Chief Justice reflected on the premeditated nature of the murder, and how he had shown off the knife to classmates. 'Those who thought he was serious received threats from him that he would kill them if they revealed his plan', the judge said. 'The applicant approached her from behind. He began to stab her in the neck and back. Whilst waiting for the police, he chatted as if nothing had happened. He had no remorse.' Mrs Maguire's widower, Don, who was in court today with daughters Emma and Kerry, earlier described the killing as a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil'.","Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed to death as she taught at school in Leeds .

"The world's richest man might seem to have it all, but Bill Gates has one regret. The self-made billionaire said he felt stupid for not knowing any foreign languages. Speaking in his third Ask Me Anything question-and-answer session for online forum Reddit, the Microsoft founder revealed that he wished he spoke French, Arabic or Chinese. The world's richest man (pictured with his wife Melinda) might seem to have it all but Bill Gates has one regret. A self-made billionaire, he said he felt stupid for not knowing any foreign languages . Speaking in his third Ask Me Anything Q&A on online forum Reddit (above), the Microsoft founder revealed that he wished he spoke French, Arabic or Chinese . He said: 'I took Latin and Greek in high school and got A's and I guess it helps my vocabulary. 'I keep hoping to get time to study one of these - probably French because it is the easiest. I did Duolingo for a while but didn't keep it up.' Gates, who is worth $79.3billion, praised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for stunning an audience in Beijing when he spoke fluent Mandarin. He said: 'Mark Zuckerberg amazingly learned Mandarin and did a Q&A with Chinese students - incredible.' Owner of a mansion worth more than $120million in his hometown of Medina, Washington, Gates' admission over language is not the first time he has given insight into his domestic habits and personal insights. The 30-year-old founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, shocked an audience when he broke out in fluent Mandarin during a Q&A last October. A self-made billionaire worth $33.6billion, Zuckerberg learned the language partly because his wife's grandmother only speaks Chinese. He married Chinese-American Priscilla Chan in 2012, and set himself the goal of learning Mandarin in 2010. He said China is a great country and hopes that learning the language will help him learn its culture. Last February, Gates said he likes to do the dishes himself - to his own exacting standards every night and shared the eyebrow-raising revelation that his wife, Melinda, would likely want Samuel L Jackson to play her husband in a biopic. He also admitted that he would pick up a $100 bill if he found it on the street. During the session yesterday, the 59-year-old said that he loves BBQ sauce but avoids it before TV appearances because he tends to spill it, his biggest splurge is having a private jet and he enjoys Indian and Thai food. He also revealed who he is rooting for in the upcoming Superbowl, which he said should be no surprise. 'This is an easy question. I am good friends with Paul Allen who owns the Seahawks and I live in Seattle,' he wrote. 'The playoff game was amazing to watch. Go Seahawks!' As he took the top spot on Forbes 28th Annual Billionaires list last year for the fourth time, he said he is pretty basic when it comes to spending on clothes and food, but that he enjoys investing in shoes and racquets for when he plays tennis. CEO of Microsoft, Gates said he will be rooting for the Seahawks in the upcoming Superbowl . Owner of a mansion worth more $120million (above) in his hometown of Medina, Washington, Gates' admission of regret regarding language  is not the first time he has insight into his domestic habits and personal insights . Gates, 59, said he really likes his dog Oreo and Nilla, pictured, when they are not barking at night and eating things they are not supposed to . When asked a life lesson he had to learn the hard way, the generous philanthropist said staying up too late is a habit he is still trying to break. 'Don't stay up too late even if the book is really exciting. You will regret it in the morning. I am still working on this problem,' he said. He shared that he had two dogs, Oreo and Nilla, which he likes when they are not barking at night. 'I will say I spend less time with the dogs than the kids do but I really like them (when they are not barking at night and not eating things they are not supposed to and when they are well house trained),' he said. 'I have resisted getting a third dog.' The father-of-three, who revealed last year that he was not going to leave trust funds to his children, was asked if he could still leap over chairs as he did during a television interview in 1994. During the meeting, he is seen leaping over the chair from a standing position, but now he said it does not come as easy as it did then. Gates said: 'A shorter chair every decade I am afraid.' He also said that his favourite spreads on bread include peanut butter, butter and cheese. Gates, father-of-three, said he will not be leaving trust funds for his children.

With a reputed 300 days of sunshine annually, the country's southern Algarve region plays host to many happy holidays throughout the year. The cost of living is low, the beaches are sandy, the cuisine is delightful and good wine can be had for €2 (£1.50) per bottle. This fabulous combination worked to make 2014 a particularly good year for tourism in the Algarve. The number of visitors in the first ten months of the year exceeded that for the whole of 2013, according to data from the National Statistics Institute (INE).

"A 625 pound felon who claimed his size made him a virtual prisoner in his home and that he shouldn’t be sent to prison after being convicted of making a bomb threat was arrested by police on earlier this month behind the wheel of his car. Jeffery Klein of Jackson, Michigan, had spent more than two years claiming that any time behind bars could put Klein at extreme risk after he admitted calling in a bomb threat at the Cedar Springs Mobile Estates on Aug. 25, 2012. When Klein repeatedly failed to appear for court hearings his attorney maintained that his client was unable to get himself to the courtroom. Jeffery Klein of Jackson, Michigan, had spent more than two years claiming that his size made him a virtual prisoner in his home and that he shouldn't be sent to prison for making a bomb threat . Klein was eventually imprisoned after police pulled over a car with a broken tail-light on New Year's Day and found Klein behind the wheel . A Kent County Circuit Court judge was considering the possibility of home-based punishment after agreeing to take Klein’s plea via internet in December, reports MLive. Then on New Year’s Day, police pulled over a car with a broken tail-light and found Klein behind the wheel. Klein was arrested and housed at the Kent County Jail until he fell while using a walker and spent several days in the hospital prior to his January 23 sentencing. In court Klein gave a tearful performance during which he said that he didn't know how long he had left and that he didn't want to die behind bars. Instead he was sentenced to at least 18 months. Klein was transferred to the Charles Egeler Reception and Guidance Center in Jackson on Monday and in a month's time he will know where he will serve his sentence. Since his arrest on New Year's Day, Klein has lost a staggering 65 pounds and he now weighs 560 pounds. Klein, pictured with his wife and family, had spent more than two years claiming that any time behind bars could put his life at risk . A Michigan corrections spokesman told MLive that prison can actually help severely obese inmates lose weight. ‘We’ve had prisoners come in here heavy and they’ve left us much healthier because they are under a specialized medical and dietary plan,’ said Chris Gautz. Prisoners like Klein don't get special food, but do not have access to the quantities of food that led to obesity in the first place. Dietitians are also on hand to ensure that they get the necessary amount of calories. Many facilities also have units with widened entries and specialized beds and larger prisoners can be housed on the ground floor to avoid stairs. Since his arrest on New Year's Day Klein has lost a staggering 65 pounds and now weighs in at 560 pounds .","Jeffery Klein of Jackson, Michigan, had spent more than two years claiming that his size made him a virtual prisoner in his home .

"Around 1 in 10 people in the UK feel lonely more than half of the time, a new study into the nation’s happiness. The Office for National Statistics found having more friends makes people feel more satisfied with their life, while most people think they can rely on their family and partner. But people who feel lonely are more likely to think that their life is not worthwhile and feel they are left out of society. Almost half of people (48 per cent) who feel lonely all of the time also feel left out of society, while a third (32.5 per cent) disagree with the idea that what they do in life is worthwhile . A quarter of people with no close friends reported being mostly, somewhat or completely dissatisfied about their life . The happiness survey was launched by David Cameron to assess the state of the nation beyond economic factors. The ONS examined surveys on loneliness and happiness using the latest data available. It shows that 11 per cent of people in the UK felt lonely all, most, or more than half of the time in 2011-12. Almost half of people (48 per cent) who feel lonely all of the time also feel left out of society, while a third (32.5 per cent) disagree with the idea that what they do in life is worthwhile. By contrast, only 6.8 per cent of people who never feel lonely feel left out. The ONS said: ‘One important aspect of personal relationships is the size of people’s networks such as the number of close friends. ‘Most people (95 per cent) reported having at least one close friend, with a majority (68%) having between 2 and 6 close friends.’ Some 1.5 per cent of people think they cannot rely on their partner at all, while 3.4 per cent said the same of their friends and 4.6 per cannot count on their family . People rate their family life more highly than their social life, the analysis by the Office for National Statistics shows . The proportion of people who are dissatisfied life increases as the number of close friends falls. A quarter of people with no close friends reported being mostly, somewhat or completely dissatisfied about their life. But the figure falls to 21 per cent of those with one close friend, 17 per cent of those with 2-6 close friends and 14 per cent of those having more than 10 close friends. Just over a third of people in the UK reported that they wish they could spend more time with their family (36 per cent) and have more social contacts (36 per cent) in 2011-12. A large majority reported being in touch, by phone or in person, with their closest friend very regularly, either on most days (34 per cent), or at least once a week (38 per cent). However, the ONS warned that social exclusion is a ‘growing concern’, adding: ‘There was a strong relationship between loneliness and other negative experiences, such as feeling left out of society, feeling that things done in life are not worthwhile and feeling a lack of recognition by others. Some 1.5 per cent of people think they cannot rely on their partner at all, while 3.4 per cent said the same of their friends and 4.6 per cent cannot count on their family.","11% of people in the UK feel lonely all, most, or more than half of the time .

"The wealth of the average American household declined between 1983 and 2013, according to a leading economist. Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, said in a new study that in those 30 years the country's net worth rose, but the average household saw a dip in wealth. Writing in a paper entitled Household Wealth Trends in the United States, 1962-2013: What Happened over the Great Recession?, Professor Wolff claimed that America's worth rose partly because technology has improved and productivity has increases. The wealth of the average American household declined between 1983 and 2013, according to a leading economist . This means that society as a whole has become better and generating wealth. The issue, for many, is that this extra wealth has been funnelled into the top 20 per cent of the population, with the top one per cent finding themselves 82 per cent better off. However, the bottom 60 per cent has become poorer, Vox.com reported. Wolff found that the median wealth figure for middle-income families - that means it's been adjusted for inflation - for 1983 was $78,000 and the median wealth figure for 2013 was $63,800. However, these are 2013 prices - households in 1983 would, in fact, have had lower wealth in cash terms, but it would have enabled them to buy more than in 2013. It follows the announcement in December by the Federal Reserve that Americans' net worth slipped in the July-September quarter, as shrinking stock portfolios overwhelmed a solid gain in home values. U.S. household wealth declined 0.2 percent in the third quarter to $81.3 trillion, the Federal Reserve said. Americans' stock and mutual fund portfolios shrank $700 billion. The value of their homes increased $245 billion. The slight drop comes after Americans' wealth rose to a record in the April-June quarter. A booming stock market and a rebound in home values have enabled the nation's net worth to rebound from the Great Recession and reach new highs. Extra wealth has been funnelled into the top 20 per cent of the population, according to Professor Wolff . Yet other data shows that those gains have mostly benefited wealthier households, while leaving middle-class wealth largely unchanged. Wolff calculates that the median household's net worth was just $63,800 in 2013, down from $64,600 in 2010. That decline came after a huge drop from 2007 to 2010, when median net worth plummeted 44 percent from $115,100. The small decrease from 2010 to 2013 occurred despite big run-ups in stock and home prices over that period. So why haven't middle-class households benefited more? Wolff cites two factors. First, middle-income households rely much more than wealthier households on the value of their homes. Houses accounts for nearly 63 percent of middle-class assets, Wolff said in his paper. That compares to just nine per cent for the wealthiest one per cent. Meanwhile, most stock market wealth is held by the top 10 per cent of households, which owns 80 per cent of stocks. Only 9.5 percent of middle-class assets are in stocks. The second reason, Wolff says, is that stagnating incomes likely forced many middle-income earners to sell assets and use the cash to cut their debt levels and maintain consumption. Median household income slipped from $49,000 in 2010 to $46,700 three years later, according to Fed data. This trend can be seen in other data. Middle-class households are now less likely to own homes, as their home ownership rate fell from 68 percent in 2010 to 66.7 percent three years later. Retirement savings have suffered even more. The percentage who owned defined-contribution retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, fell from 53 percent in 2007 before the recession, to 44 percent in 2013. The dollar value of middle-class accounts dropped 16 percent during that period. 'They were still depleting their assets because income remained very sluggish,' Wolff said.","Edward Wolff says wealth of average US household has declined .
Worth has dropped between 1983 and 2013, the NYU economist said .
US overall is better off, but wealth has been funnelled into the top 20% ."
"While the film is currently topping box offices around the world, former Minnesota gov and Navy SEAL Jesse Ventura has confirmed he will not be seeing American Sniper, saying that Chris Kyle was 'no hero'. Ventura won a $1.8 million defamation lawsuit last year against the estate of the late Chris Kyle, the SEAL protagonist in the movie. He said yesterday he will not see the film partly because Kyle 'is no hero' to him. Former Navy SEAL and Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura (left) sued the late Chris Kyle (right) for defamation and was eventually awarded a $1.8 million lawsuit - he says he will not see the film based on Kyle's life . 'A hero must be honorable, must have honor. And you can't have honor if you're a liar. 'There is no honor in lying,' Ventura told The Associated Press from his winter home in Baja California, Mexico. Ventura also dismissed the film as 'propaganda' because it conveys the idea that Iraq had something to do with the 9/11 attacks. 'It's as authentic as 'Dirty Harry,' he said, referring to fictional movie series starring Clint Eastwood, the director of 'American Sniper.' The film has sparked debate over whether snipers should be considered heroes. Ventura during his time as a successful professional wrestler after leaving the military . Kyle was killed in February 2013 on a remote shooting range in Texas by a disturbed veteran  said to have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Ventura was criticised by some for continuing his lawsuit against Kyle's estate following his death. He filed suit against Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, who inherited an estimated $6million Kyle had gained from the book. Ventura claimed Kyle fabricated a subchapter in his 'American Sniper' book, where Kyle claimed he punched a man in a California bar in 2006 for allegedly saying the SEALs 'deserve to lose a few' in Iraq. Kyle later identified the man as Ventura. Ventura, who worked as a professional wrestler after leaving the military, said this incident never happened and sued. After deliberating for nearly six days, a jury in St. Paul, Minnesota, returned a verdict against Kyle's estate - finding that the Ventura had been defamed by Kyle's account. Publisher HarperCollins removed the passage from the best-seller, and it gets no mention in the movie. Kyle's estate has since appealed. Ventura's separate lawsuit against HarperCollins remains pending. Shortly before his death Kyle defended his story in videotaped testimony, and said the account was accurate. Ventura is now working on the second season of his online-only political talk show 'Off the Grid' at Ora.tv, which he records in Mexico, where he lives in a solar-powered home with a satellite Internet connection. Ed Huddleston, a lawyer for Mrs Kyle, said they won't comment on Ventura's remarks because the lawsuit is on appeal. The former Marine charged in Kyle's death goes on trial in Texas next month. The 'American Sniper' film has earned more than $200 million domestically since it was released  on Christmas day. It was recently nominated for six Academy Awards, including nods for Best Picture and Best Actor for Bradley Cooper's portrayal of Kyle. While the movie has been a box office hit, it has also divided opinion, with some criticising the film's 'jingoistic' stance. Chris Kyle pictured with his wife, Taya in April 2012 -  he was killed in February 2013 on a remote shooting range in Texas by a disturbed veteran believed to have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder . Critics of the movie included talk show host Bill Maher, who claimed the film is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero. Speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, he drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'. The film tells the story of Kyle, who was raised in rural Texas and started out working as a cowboy. He applied to join the SEALs but was turned down because a rodeo accident had left him with metal pins in his arms. However, in the late Nineties the unit relaxed its entrance requirements and Kyle was put through the fearsomely tough selection and training regime. In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq where he made his first long-distance kills even though he had not been trained as sniper. Spotting his obvious talent, the military sent him to SEAL sniper school, where he was taught how to perform the controversial job. Bradley Cooper as Navy SEAL Chris Kyle in a scene from 'American Sniper' - the film was released last month . In 2004 Kyle was posted to Fallujah in west Baghdad, a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency - and it was during the battle for the city where he first made his mark. However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that Mr Kyle gained his nickname as 'The Legend' from his fellow SEALs. One day, while positioned on a roof, Kyle watched a moped coming down a street. Riding it were two men, one of whom dropped a backpack into a pothole. Realising that it contained an improvised explosive, Kyle took a shot at the speeding moped from a range of 150 yards. The bullet hit one of the riders, passed through him, and hit the other. In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired. The most lethal sniper in U.S. military history, Kyle had 160 confirmed kills and also gained himself a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry.","Jesse Ventura is a former Navy Seal and ex governor of Minnesota .

"One of the stars of TLC's hit series My 600lb Life, who lost more than half his body weight, is working to put his life back together and meet someone special following the failure of his second marriage. During a special one-off episode of the TLC show, which aired last night, viewers were given a chance to see how Chuck Turner's incredible 433lb weight loss has changed his life as he prepares to 'get out there' and go on his first blind date since splitting with his second wife Nissa. When viewers first met the 46-year-old from Beaumont, Texas, his 693lb frame and immobility were frustrating Nissa, who felt his vast size made their marriage akin to a carer-patient relationship and prohibited him from taking care of their adopted son Nathan. Scroll down for video . Moving forward: After losing more than 400lbs, Chuck Turner, 46, shared his incredible story with his church congregation, which has been a 'source of strength' following his split from his second wife Nissa . Chuck, who began rapidly gaining weight after the murder of his first wife in 2006, became so large, that a 40lb lymphedema, a lump caused by a build-up of fluid, had appeared on his leg. 'Back when I was heavy I couldn't move around,"" he explained on last night's episode. 'I couldn't function the way I needed to because of the weight. I was too heavy to do my job, so I used to rely on my [tow truck] competitors to help me.' After having gastric bypass surgery in 2013, Chuck has gotten down to 260lbs and the huge lump on his leg is gone. Although his marriage to Nissa was unable to be saved, he is once again able to meet the physical demands of his job and climb on his truck's flatbed - something he could never do when he was massively obese. Second chance: The 46-year-old from Beaumont, Texas said the members of his church remind him he has a lot to look forward to. He also revealed that his friend is going to set him up a blind date as he continues to rebuild his life . Fitness test: On last night's episode of the TLC show, Chuck showed viewers that after losing 433lbs, he is once again able to meet the physical demands of his tow truck business . He noted that he is even looking to hire more employees and expand his business, something he never would 'have dreamed' a year ago. 'I know Nissa felt like I was too big to take care of my family and do what I needed to do,' he said, 'so it means a lot to me to be able to do my job like I should.' Chuck explained that he is also trying to rebuild his life outside of work 'a little bit at a time', which includes attending church regularly. He said his church has been 'another inspiration' and a 'source of strength' during his journey. During the episode, Chuck shared his story with members of the congregation. Hard times: When Chuck was nearly 700lbs (right) he relied on his business's competitors to help him tow cars because he size left him practically immobile .

Love lost: When viewers first met Chuck, his 693lb frame was putting a strain on his marriage to his second wife Nissa and he was unable to play with their adopted son Nathan . 'The people in my church never condemn me,' he said. 'All they did was support me and pray for me.' He explained that the additional support showed him that 'there is a lot to be thankful for'. 'There is a lot to look forward to,' he said. A friend of mine wants to set me up on a blind date. I am looking forward to getting out there and meeting someone, but right now I am going to focus on making more progress.'

"The first confirmed case of a human contracting a brain-eating amoeba though tap water has been revealed in a medical journal. An unnamed four-year-old boy from Louisiana picked up the deadly Naegleria fowleri while playing on a homemade water slide. He died two weeks later from a condition that the amoeba triggered called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). A four-year-old boy's death is the first case of brain-eating amoeba - Naegleria fowleri - in tap water. The organisms trigger an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) whch attacks brain cells. A stock image of the infection, which was studied under a microscope and stained, is shown . Previous victims of the organism have been infected after swimming in warm, freshwater lakes and rivers. PAM is almost universally fatal and is triggered by water containing the amoeba entering the nose during swimming, according to the study by researchers from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. N. fowleri travels to the brain via the olfactory nerve and passes through a porous bone between the sinuses and the brain, where it breaks down nerve cells. This causes the brain to swell, causing symptoms including vomiting, delirium and seizures. Primary Amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare disease of the central nervous system, caused by a waterborne amoeba - Naegleria fowleri. This stained microscope image shows brain tissue with the free living parasite in it (dark purple) Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare disease of the central nervous system, caused by a waterborne amoeba - Naegleria fowleri. The amoeba enters the nose and travels up the olfactory nerve (shown as spidery legs in image) The microorganism typically lives in warm, stagnant bodies of freshwater. It enters the central nervous system by attaching itself to the olfactory nerve after water is taken through the nose. It then migrates through porous bone and into the olfactory bulbs of the brain, where it multiplies by feeding on nerve tissue. Between three and seven days after infection, people exhibit symptoms such losing their sense of smell and taste, because the nerve cells of the olfactory bulbs are eaten. After this, the infection spreads to the rest of the brain, resulting in headaches, nausea and rigidity of the neck muscles, progressing to vomiting, delirium, seizures, and eventually irreversible coma. People typically die two weeks after contact with the amoeba due to respiratory failure, when the infection spreads to the brain stem, destroying the nerve cells of the medulla oblongata, which controls the functions of breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. The boy in Louisiana (not pictured) picked up Naegleria fowleri while playing on a homemade water slide, like this one (stock image) The unnamed boy was taken to a Louisiana hospital in July 2013, nine days after playing on the slide. He had a 40°C (104°F) fever, severe headache and bouts of vomiting, as well as staring straight ahead without responding for a few seconds at a time. At first, doctors thought he may have had meningitis, but a CT scan, spinal tap and other tests failed to identify the infection, which could not be treated with antibiotics. Five days after being admitted to hospital, the boy suffered seizures before being declared brain dead. His family made the heart-breaking decision to take him off life support five days later, Newsweek reported. It was only after testing brain specimens that experts pinpointed the cause of death as being down to the amoeba which triggered PAM. ‘This case is the first reported PAM death associated with culturable N. fowleri in tap water from a US treated drinking water system,’ the study says. Water samples collected from the home and the water distribution system that provided the tap water for the water slide, were tested and N. fowleri identified in both samples. Others have died as a result of ingesting N. fowleri in contaminated water after Hurricane Katrina, as well as in other states. The microorganism is usually harmless and only infects the brain if it journeys through the nasal passages. The state of Louisiana has ramped up efforts to test water supplies for the amoeba, as well as advising that more chlorine be added during water treating, iKnowledge reported. And a microbiologist is investigating how the amoeba becomes infectious and why some people seem to be more susceptible to it than others. The reports was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.","Boy is thought to have picked up Naegleria fowleri playing on a water slide .

"It is hard to imagine the mortification Benedict Cumberbatch felt after he used the word 'coloured' instead of 'black' when trying to make a point about the lack of roles available for ethnic minorities in the UK. His regret will no doubt have been intensified by the fact, just less than two years ago, the painful matter of how his family made its fortune came under scrutiny when he starred in 12 Years A Slave. Cumberbatch's ancestors were slave owners, boasting '250 negroes' on their sugar plantation in Barbados in the 18th and 19th centuries, and were given - on the abolition of the slave trade in the 1830s -  £6,000 to compensate for the loss of their 'human property'. In today's money, the compensation would be the equivalent of more than £3.6m. Now, MailOnline can show pictures of inside the plantation where hundreds of men and women toiled as slaves while his ancestors reaped the rewards. Scroll down for video . Wealth: The Cumberbatch family owned Cleland Plantation, in Saint Andrew, Barbados, (pictured) for 100 years - during which time as many as 250 slaves . Slave trade: Abraham Cumberbatch - seen here in a portrait hanging in St Nicholas Abbey Planation - was Benedict Cumberbatch's seventh great-grandfather, and the first of his family to run a plantation using slaves . 'Sort of apology': Benedict Cumberbatch as William Pitt the Younger, in 2006's Amazing Grace - a role he took as a 'sort of apology' for his family's part in the slave trade . The Cumberbatch family are aware of how their dark past at Cleland Plantation, in Saint Andrew, Barbados, is viewed by the wider world. His mother, the actress Wanda Ventham, had urged him not to use his real surname professionally, in case it made him a target for reparation claims by the descendants of slaves. But Cumberbatch, 38, has always been open about his history and, if anything, appears to have sought out roles which allow him no room to hide. The Oscar-nominee, who is up for the best actor gong on February 22, first spoke of it when he appeared in the abolition film Amazing Grace in 2006. At the time, he half-joked he took the role of Willaim Pitt the Younger 'as a sort of apology' for his ancestry. But it would be his role in the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave which would truly thrust the Cumberbatch history into the spotlight. Art imitating life: Cumberbatch played William Ford in the 2013 film, a plantation owner who was the first man to buy Solomon Northup, played by Ejiofor . Property: The people enslaved on the sugar plantation were seen as nothing more than property by Cumberbatch's ancestors: They were included in the overall value of the property, alongside the land, in the family's accounts . Comfortable: The Cumberbatch family were able to build up their wealth by using slaves to work on the sugar plantation - using it to create a comfortable lifestyle in the Caribbean country. Pictured is the sitting room at Cleland . The film, based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a 19th century black musician who was kidnapped and sold into the slave trade, saw Cumberbatch playing William Ford, the man who 'owned' Northup first. It was a role which, surely, wasn't that far removed from his own ancestors, who moved to Barbados in the late 17th century. The move was the idea of his eighth-great-grandfather, Joshua, who brought his wife Ann and three children half way across the world for a new life. But Joshua died shortly after arrival and would never see the plantations his descendants would go onto own after his son Abraham built up the family fortune. Modern day: Cumberbatch with his parents Wanda Ventham (left) and Timothy Carlton (right, with actress Tracie Bennett in 2012), who are both professional actors who even appeared alongside him in Sherlock. His mother Wanda warned him not to use his surname, for fear of reprisals fro the descendants of slaves . Will: Abraham had built up a significant fortune, but had no sons - so he left the plantation to his grandson, on the understanding he would change his surname to Cumberbatch, while also stipulating it would also 'be kept staffed with 250 negro slaves' and 150 cattle . Diversifying: Cumberbatch did not just own the farms however, he also built refineries, which helped to add ot his fortune. Pictured is an old map of the plantation . Rebellion: The family - whose members are thought to be buried at St Peter's Parish Church, in Barbados - left the country in 1820, four years after the slaves revolted in 1816, led by a man called Bussa - who worked on their plantation . Compensation: When the slave trade came to an end in 1838, Abraham Parry, Cumberbatch's great-great-great grandfather was given £6,000 for the loss of his human property. Pictured above is a worker on the plantation today . Empire: Cumberbatch's direct ancestors were not the only members of the family to own property on the island. The nearby St Nicholas Abbey plantation was also own by the Cumberbatch family . Abraham learned the basics of the sugar industry as a salaried plantation foreman, before buying up plantations in the early 18th century and building refineries to turn raw cane into sugar. The family lived in comfort, in the white walled house with shuttered windows and large rooms where they could shelter from the heat. By the time he died in 1750, Abraham had built up a small fortune. But he had no son to inherit. His will showed his priorities: he left his estate to his grandson Abraham (his daughter's son) on the condition he changed his surname to Cumberbatch and stipulated that his plantation 'be kept staffed with 250 negro slaves and 150 head of cattle'. Pastor: Cumberbatch's character in 12 Years A Slave was a pastor - yet did not disagree with owning other human beings . Faith: The inside of the church where Benedict's family once worshiped in Barbados . Working: The plantation is still going today, although underneath the ownership of a new family . Portrait: Yet more than 150 years after the Cumberbatch family left the plantation, a painting of Abraham Cumberbatch still stands in the hallway . Modern: The plantation was bought by 66-year-old Steven Tempro in 1985, and has been updated for modern living . Workers rights: Today, the people who work on the plantation are all paid a fair wage for a day's work . Owner: Steven Tempro stands on the steps where Cumberbatch's ancestors once watched over their land . History: A picture of Steven, left, as a young boy with his family . The plantations passed down the generations until 1816, when Abraham's grandson, Abraham Parry, faced a rebellion from one of his slaves. The uprising lasted two months until Bussa and an estimated 1,000 slaves were killed – another 214 slaves were executed and 123 shipped off the island. But the writing was on the wall. In 1820 Abraham Parry returned to Britain to live at Fairwater House, a stately home, in Devon, which is now the site of Taunton School, and 18 years later the slave trade in Barbados was abolished – Cumberbatch great-great-great grandfather received more than £6,000 for the loss of their 'human' property.","Imitation Game star has previously revealed his shame at family history .

Dropped: The Wayne County Prosecutor's Office will drop the last remaining charge against Joseph Weekley, pictured in this file photo, who shot and killed a 7-year-old girl after two trials ended without a conviction . Weekley was indicted in 2011 on a charge of involuntary manslaughter charge for the shooting, which authorities believe was unintentional. The first trial ended without a verdict in June 2013. His second ended in October with a hung jury. During the second trial, a judge dismissed a charge of involuntary manslaughter. Worthy called it 'unfortunate' that Judge Cynthia Gray Hathaway dismissed the felony manslaughter charge, leaving only the misdemeanor count, which carries a two-year maximum sentence. 'Under the law, her decision cannot be appealed,' Worthy said in a statement. Aiyana's grandmother, Mertilla Jones, said in a statement Wednesday that 'it feels like the system' failed their family. Jones called Gray Hathaway's dismissal of the manslaughter charge 'even more insidious, given the fact that a 7-year-old child was killed while she was sleeping.' Victim: Police claimed Aiyana Stanley-Jones's grandmother struggled with Weekley, leading to the fatal shot, though her grandmother denies a struggle took place . Grieving: Aiyana's parents, Dominika Stanley and Charles Jones, wept on the stand in this file photo from 2010 . Haunted: Though he did not testify in either trial, Weekley has said he is 'haunted' by the raid, which a high-ranking official in the Detroit Police Department said broke protocol . Weekley's attorney, Steve Fishman, said the prosecutor's decision was 'courageous' and 'a correct one.' Weekley has said he feels 'haunted' by the tragedy. His was supposed to be an elite police unit, but a high-ranking Detroit police official told Mother Jones the raid broke protocol and that officers 'went Hollywood.' Officers were after Chauncey Owens, who an informant said was to blame for the murder of 17-year-old Je'Rean Blake Nobles days before. Instead they stormed the apartment where Charles Jones and his family were. Jones was later found guilty of second-degree murder in Je'Rean's death for providing the gun Owens used to shoot him, the Detroit Free Press reports. During the raid, Weekley's submachine gun fired seconds after a stun grenade was thrown through a window. He didn't testify but insisted that he mistakenly pulled the trigger during a struggle with Aiyana's grandmother, who denies she struggled with the officer. Ron Scott, a spokesman for Aiyana's family and founder of the Detroit Coalition against Police Brutality, said they will push the federal government to seek civil rights charges in the case. 'This kind of blatant disregard and militarization that destroys human life, we have to stop it and send a message that it will not be tolerated, especially in the lives of young black people,' Scott said.","Joseph Weekley shot and killed Aiyana Stanley-Jones while she slept on a couch near her grandmother .

"A woman who lost the use of her hands after a debilitating illness has learnt paint, embroider and even give her husband a trim - just by using her feet. Bai Aixiang's feet are so dexterous, she can even change the blades on the razor before she sets to work shaving the head of her husband Ma Wanwa, 70, at their home in Heyuan, in north-western China's Ningxia Hui autonomous region. Bai  contracted polio at the age of 12 which left her hands permanently deformed while a later disease robbed her of what little use she had left. Chinese woman Bai Aixiang has learnt to use her feet for everything- even trimming her husband's hair- since contracting polio as a child which left her hands deformed . With her hands completely unusable, the 49-year-old decided to teach herself how to use her feet to carry out day-to-day activities. 'I learned to do many of the things an able-bodied person would do,' she said. 'I knew that one day my parents would not be around for me and in any case even as a young girl I managed to learn a lot of stuff just by using my feet. 'I can cook, I can even do needlework or wash clothes or whatever. Shaving my husband's head is really quite easy in comparison with sewing.' The 49-year-old often gives her husband Ma Wanwa a haircut at their home in Heyuan township in Jingyuan county in north-western China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region . Bai's feet are so dexterous, she can even change the blades on the razor before she sets to work . Because of her disability, Bai had struggled to find a husband and had resigned herself to living her life alone . But her life  changed when her neighbours introduced her at the age of 33 to Ma (pictured kissing her foot) who  tried to persuade her to marry him despite the 21-year-age difference . Winter days are the harshest time for Bai, she said, because her feet go numb when she keeps them uncovered and works with freezing cold water. Because of her disability, Bai said she had struggled to find a husband and had resigned herself to living her life alone. But at the age of 33, her neighbours introduced her at to widower Ma, then 54, who was living with his daughter. He fell for her instantly and asked her to marry him despite the 21-year-age difference. She said: 'I didn't mind about the age difference but I regarded him as somebody not suitable because he had already had a wife and although she had died he had a daughter and I just felt he wasn't right for me.' But, after a little persuasion by her parents, Bai agreed to the wedding and now the couple dote on one another. She said: 'I had a daughter with him but we lost her in 2000, and although I was devastated the loss brought us closer together and now I really have to say that we love each other a lot.' She admitted she had taken a little persuading by her parents to agree to marry the widower but had finally accepted . After the tragic loss of their daughter, the couple are closer than ever and Ma is always happy for his wife to give him a trim (pictured wiping off the hair after the shave) Bai (pictured washing up) has learnt to use her feet for everything after contracting polio at the age of 12 which left her hands deformed .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott For Dailymail.com . and . Tamara Abraham for MailOnline . Updated: . 17:09 EST, 29 January 2015 . Lindsay Wixson may have starred in hundreds of high-profile fashion shows over the course of her five-year modeling career, but she's still rather prone to falling over. The 20-year-old beauty posted a snap to her Instagram account this morning of her bandaged ankle; the result of 'walking off the end of the runway' at the Jean Paul Gaultier show yesterday at Paris Fashion Week. The fall wasn't captured on camera, so it may have happened during a rehearsal, but Miss Wixson blamed the vision-obscuring 'bee-keepers' headgear she was wearing for causing her to lose her footing. Scroll down for video . Occupational hazard: Lindsey Wixson, 20, posted a snap to her Instagram account this morning of her bandaged ankle - the result of 'walking off the end of the runway' at the Jean Paul Gaultier show yesterday . Un-bee-lievable! The fall, which happened at Paris Fashion Week, wasn't captured on camera and so may have occurred during the rehearsal. Pictured, Miss Wixson (upright) at the show which caused her injury . If the fall did happen during a rehearsal, it means that Miss Wixson would have walked the show regardless of her injury, only seeking medical attention afterwards. She accompanied the photo with an explanation, stating: 'The result after walking off the end of #jeanpaulgaultier runway from my bee-keepers mask yesterday. 5 days wrapped.' Fans from her 135,000-strong Instagram following have expressed their sympathies, with one commenting, 'speedy healing!' and another writing, 'get well soon gorgeous'. Luckily for the model - hailing from Wichita, Kansas and famed for her rosebud-pout and gap-tooth-combo - New York Fashion Week doesn't start for another two weeks. Miss Wixson has already walked several shows in Paris this week; including Chanel, Versace, Alexandre Vauthier and Elie Saab.

In demand: She has already walked several shows in Paris this week, including Chanel (left), Alexandre Vauthier (center) and Elie Saab (right) Success! Miss Wixson did manage to avoid falling at last Sunday's Versace show (pictured), having slipped over twice on the designer's catwalk  in the past, once in 2014 and once in 2012 . This is not the first time the teenager, from Witchita, Kansas, has fallen at a high-profile show. In fact, it's her fourth documented tumble. Her Bambi-legs last collapsed at Versace's 2014 Fall/Winter show, and before that, at the same designers' 2012 Spring/Summer show. And back in 2011, Miss Wixson made headlines around the world when she fell numerous times on one catwalk at Naomi Campbell's Fashion for Relief fundraiser in Cannes. The performance this time was so dramatic that many believed she had fallen on purpose for effect, but Miss Wixson insists this was not the case. Repeat offender: Miss Wixson's Bambi-legs last collapsed at Versace's 2014 Fall/Winter show (pictured) Over she goes: Before that, she fell at Versace's 2012 Spring/Summer show (pictured) while wearing some admittedly tricky-looking heels . Sense of humor: Still, the industry favorite raised her arms in victory once she was back on her feet . Few girls could survive such a faux-pas, as a model agency insider once revealed to the Daily Mail Online. Indeed, our source admitted that falling on the catwalk can in fact be career-threatening. 'It's quite common for girls to be quietly dropped by their agents after tripping or falling during a show,' they said. 'As far as the designers are concerned the model's job is to make the clothes look fantastic. That's compromised when she starts stumbling down the catwalk like a drunk. They added that many models lived in fear of falling on the runway, and often had tricks to avoid it happening. Not again! Back in 2011, Miss Wixson made headlines around the world when she fell numerous times on one catwalk at Naomi Campbell's Fashion for Relief fundraiser in Cannes (pictured) Dramatic: The performance was so extreme that many believed she had fallen on purpose for effect . 'I know girls who will do anything to avoid it, include asking for shoes . a bone-crushing size too small to ensure there is no chance of their . high heels coming loose half way down the catwalk,' they revealed. 'I came across one girl who carried sandpaper in her Gucci handbag and . used it to rough up the bottom of her show shoes to give her extra grip.' The source did admit, however, that the more well-known models were less likely to be affected. 'If the model has an existing profile and clientele then she will probably survive a few stumbles - look at Naomi Campbell.' Luckily for Miss Wixson, who was bullied at . school for her unusual looks, her clients appear to be highly forgiving. Since making her debut, she has appeared in campaigns for Alexander McQueen, Miu Miu and Mulberry, among many others. FALL COLLECTION: A HISTORY OF RUNWAY STUMBLES . Taking a tumble: A model went flying on the slippery runway at a Marc by Marc Jacobs show in February 2010 . Slip-up: A Prada show in 2008 descended into farce when a last-minute decision to have the models wear little socks with their heels caused many of them to slip and fall across the runway .

"New Zealand reigned supreme once again, taking the prize for Top Country in Wanderlust Magazine's 2015 Travel Awards for the second year in a row. With a satisfaction rating of almost 98 per cent, the Kiwis sure know a thing or two about keeping their visitors happy. But for those who prefer more adventurous getaways, allow us to point you toward Papua New Guinea, which scooped up top honours in the Top Emerging Destination category. Papua New Guinea was ranked first as Wanderlust Magazine's Top Emerging Destination for 2015 . The country is known for its lush coral reefs, and as such, exceptional snorkelling and scuba diving . 1. New Zealand . 2. Namibia . 3. Ethiopia . 4. Bhutan . 5. Zambia . 6. Oman . 7. Costa Rice . 8. Laos . 9. Burma/Myanmar . 10. Vietnam . 1. Luang Prabang, Laos . 2. Bagan, Burma . 3. Stockholm, Sweden . 4. Kyoto, Japan . 5. Hoi An, Vietnam . 6. Vancouver, Canada . 7. Berlin, Germany . 8. Rome, Italy . 9. Vienna, Austria . 10. Krakow, Poland . Despite it's difficult travel terrain, the country ranked at 100 per cent in visitor satisfaction. Mongolia and Montenegro tied for second place, while Iran and Bolivia came in third. 'Despite being challenging for independent travellers, Papua New Guinea has struck a chord with our readers,' Editor in Chief, Lyn Hughes, explained. 'It seems that people are increasingly looking for that off the beaten track travel experience and PNG, along with Mongolia and Iran, really do satisfy their thirst for adventure.' Although the travel terrain is difficult, visitors are able to to visit traditional tribal cultural ceremonies . One of the most popular tourist destinations is the Kokoda Track,  a footpath offering views of the Owen Stanley mountain range . Among the top attractions in the exotic Oceanic country, Papua New Guinea offers incomparable snorkelling and scuba diving opportunities, as well as a chance to experience fascinating traditional tribal cultures. However, with little to no tourism infrastructure, it's not a destination to visit without proper preparation. Still, its biodiversity is unparalleled, particularly along the Kokoda Track, which runs throughout the Owen Stanley mountain range. Other emerging destinations include Mongolia and Montenegro (pictured), known for its stunning coastline . Iran took the fourth spot in the Emerging Destinations category. Pictured: the Azadi monument in Tehran . Mongolia and Montenegro have recently gained prominence . Famous for it's nomad culture, visitors to Mongolia can opt to explore the country's Gobi desert from the comfort of a traditional yurt. The small Balkan nation of Montenegro is known for its expansive coastline and stunning mountain ranges - and is quickly growing in popularity as a premiere European summer beach destination. Luang Prabang, Laos, nabbed the Top City spot, which isn't surprising given that it's UNESCO Heritage listed . Luang Prabang is particularly known for its friendly, welcoming locals and the large population of monks . Luang Prabang in Laos is likewise back for another year at the top of its category, Top City, boasting a satisfaction rating of just over 97 per cent. Known for monks, sticky rice, and lovely locals, Luang Prabang has held the top spot nine times in the last 10 years. 1. Papua New Guinea . 2. Mongolia . 3. Montenegro . 4. Iran . 5. Bolivia . Not surprising, considering that the city itself is so culturally rich that it's UNESCO Heritage listed. Closely following in second is Bagan, Burma, with Stockholm, Sweden, rounding out the top three. The inclusion of Stockholm is particularly surprising, given the fact that Wanderlust readers have often opted to select Asian hubs in this category. Still, with unique cuisine, minimalist design and even popular TV crime dramas, Scandinavia is gaining more attention than ever before as a must-visit travel destination. Bagan, Burma, is known for its world-class architecture, such as the Ananda Pahto temple and the Shwezigon Paya religious site. Stockholm, Sweden is the third ranked in the Top Cities category thanks to its cosmopolitan nature . Bagan, Burma was named the second best city, largely due to its breathtaking religious sites, like the Ananda Pahto temple, pictured. Other Top Country highlights include Ethiopia and Namibia. 'Although New Zealand is back on top, it is particularly interesting to see Ethiopia voted third - having not even made the top ten last year,' Hughes added. 'With its rare wolves, rock-hewn churches, mighty mountains and elaborate coffee ceremonies, this country is fascinating. The Top UK Destination? Nope, not London! It's the Lake District in the North that took top honours . 1. Lake District . 2. London . 3. Cornwall . 4. Scottish Highlands . 5. Edinburgh . 6. Peak District . 7. York . 8. Northumberland . 9.

"A US based anti-vaccination campaigner, whose seminars were repeatedly boycotted by Australian doctors and venues, has announced the cancellation of her remaining talks due to consistent threats of violence from 'anti-free-speech terrorists'. Sherri Tenpenny was due to speak at a number of events in Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne and the Gold Coast, however a statement posted to one of her social media accounts on Wednesday, announced they had been cancelled. The reason cited was that a large number of violent threats, including bomb-threats, had been made against venue owners and their families. 'The determination was made to protect the speakers, the public and the venue owners as pro-vaccine extremists have made continual, anonymous threats of vandalism and violence,' the statement read. Scroll down for video . U.S. anti-vaccination campaigner Sherri Tenpenny has cancelled a series of talks scheduled for Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sydney following violent threats . Australian ant-vaccine campaigner Stephanie Messenger, who had also planned to speak at the events, confirmed that she and Dr Tenpenny were concerned about the safety of the seminar attendees. 'Some people were planning to bring babies. The threats have been persistent. We are not able to insure that the attendees would be safe from harm,' Ms Messenger said. Dr Tenpenny revealed that she had also cancelled a private holiday in Australia due to concerns for her own personal safety. 'I was coming to speak as an invited guest. However, given the level of hostility that has transpired over the last three weeks, and for the sake of my own personal safety, I have also cancelled my planned vacation in Australia,' she said. The statement added: 'Additional options are being considered but not confirmed at this time. A refund will be issued for all tickets sold.' The osteopath physician, whose seminars claim vaccinations cause autism and other health problems, said that 'continual, anonymous threats of vandalism and violence' had been made against venue operators . Police are understood to be investigating the violent threats, which they said may have actually been made by anti-vaccination activists, the ABC reports. The cancellation comes just weeks after the general manager of Sydney's Kareela Golf and Social Club, Dennis Skinner, told the ABC that the club had cancelled Ms Tenpenny's event as they did not want to be tied to the contentious issue. 'The club as a venue, we don't have a position for or against this, we just decided the subject matter was too controversial for us to be involved in,' he said. Ms Messenger responded at the time by saying people who were against the seminars were suppressing information. 'They say they want parents to make an informed choice, but you can't do that if you don't have all the information.' she said. Kareela Golf and Social Club (pictured above) was scheduled to hold one of Dr Tenpenny's seminars but they cancelled it earlier this month . There are two change.org petitions currently still circulating in relation to Dr Tenpenny's now cancelled visit. One of them has come to the attention of the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. The Refuse Sherri Tenpenny's Visa into Australia petition asked the department to deny the campaigner a visa, citing she was 'a danger to Australian children and society as a whole due to her extremist and uneducated views regarding vaccination'. So far, it has garnered over 7,000 signatures and a spokesman for Mr Dutton told the ABC he was 'taking advice on this matter and will make further comment when appropriate'. The other petition was started by anti-vaccine group Stop the AVN called Do not allow Sherri Tenpenny to give her anti-vaccine talks in Australia. People applauded the move from the club to shutdown the seminar, saying 'Thank you for making the ethical decision' While others saw the cancellation as an attack on freedom of speech . It urged venues holding her seminars to cancel the events as she and other 'anti-vaccination extremists pose a severe threat to Australian society with their uneducated bogus claims'. Earlier this month, Dr Tenpenny defended her seminars after pro-immunisation parents labelled them 'disgusting'. Dr Tenpenny said she found the backlash on social media 'curious'. 'I planned to be in Australia for a holiday and was asked to speak with a few groups who are interested in discussing the pros and cons of vaccines,' she told Daily Mail Australia via email. 'It is curious why the public health, pro-vaccine community is so outraged over my visit and the opportunity to share information sourced from conventional medical journals. 'If vaccines were so effective, so protective and so incredibly safe, no one would be interested in these gatherings. It came just days after Dr Tenpenny defended the seminars after pro-immunisation parents labelled them as 'disgusting' Doctors who were meant to hold a conference at Melbourne's Bayview Eden had also cancelled an event . Dr Tenpenny's arrival had people outraged and sparked an online campaign to stop her from speaking . 'The public health community should be willing to openly discuss they problems associated with vaccines, how to improve vaccine safety, and how to restore the health of those who have been vaccine-injured.' On her website, Dr Tenpenny writes that she believes 'vaccines can cause more harm to the health of the individual' and is against 'a system that forces parents to inject their children, against their better judgment'. Her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the T-shirts sold on her site, which read: 'I didn't deny my children vaccines... I spared them' and 'Fact: 1 in 50 = Autism Overall, Fact: 1 in 25,000 = Unvaccinated, Prove Me Wrong'. Her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the T-shirts sold on her site . People took to social media to express their outrage, with one pro-vaccine group starting a letter writing campaign . The seminars were called Raising Healthy Children Naturally and Birth, Baby and Beyond . This comes after the Federal Court ruled against Homeopathy Plus, finding homeopathic vaccines were not scientifically proven to be effective, and said the health website had mislead people into thinking they could be used as a substitute for medical vaccines, News Corp reported. National Centre of Immunisaiton Research and Surveillance director Peter McIntyre told Daily Mail Australia Dr Tenpenny was tapping into people's 'fear factor'. 'When we've got no disease to see, it's very easy to look at something like autism - unfortunately it's something we still don't understand - and start to suggest it has something to do with being vaccinated. You can understand why people would believe that,' he said. 'But there are hundreds of studies that disprove that.' Professor McIntyre added there was no scientific evidence homeopathic vaccinations protected people against infectious diseases. He said it was like asking someone if they wanted to be vaccinated with 'sterile water'. 'It's just laughable really,' Professor McIntyre said.","Sherri Tenpenny is an osteopath physician who believes in not vaccinating .

"A Canadian teenager, who was placed in handcuffs in a police car with a convicted sex offender, who then assaulted her, is suing the police force. File photo . A young Canadian woman is suing a force for $400,000 after an officer left her handcuffed in the back of a police car with a repeat sex offender - who then assaulted her. The woman, who was 17 at the time, says she has suffered from post-traumatic stress after the attack in northern Quebec in September 2011. The incident occurred in Tasiujaq, a tiny Inuit lakeside community that is only accessible by airplane, snowmobile or boat. The lawsuit alleges 'a serious lack of professionalism and gross negligence' by the Kativik regional police, Cbc reported. It also claims the officer's actions 'show an incredible lack of concern for the safety of the plaintiff'. The suit names the officer involved as well as the local police service and the regional government. Police had been called to remove the woman, who had been drinking, from a residence. She was put in the back of a police car in handcuffs with a man - Joe Kritik - who had been convicted of four sexual assaults at the time and was listed on the sexual offenders registry. He was not handcuffed. Kritik had been arrested earlier for causing a disturbance, according to civil lawsuit documents filed at Quebec Superior Court. The officer responsible had been on the job less than a month and was not authorized to carry a handgun. She left the two in the back of the vehicle while getting details about the young woman from the complainant. The incident occurred in Tasiujaq, pictured,  a tiny lakeside community only accessible by airplane, snowmobile or boat . According to court documents, the officer returned to the car to find Kritik on top of the woman with his pants down. The officer then pulled Kritik off the woman. 'The plaintiff was unable to defend herself, being handcuffed in her back and unable to leave the vehicle, the doors being locked,' the lawsuit alleges. Both the young woman and Kritik were taken to the police station and put in different cells. The lawsuit also alleges the same officer, who was the only one on duty at the time, slammed the cell door in the woman’s face, breaking her tooth. No rape kit was performed and the woman’s parents were not contacted. The young woman testified in court that she was sexually assaulted. Kritik eventually pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault and was sentenced to 39 months in jail. The officer involved in the incident was suspended and later resigned. The lawsuit claims the officer's actions 'show an incredible lack of concern for the safety of the plaintiff'. She was suspended and later resigned . An internal investigation by the Kativik regional police force cleared her of any criminal wrongdoing. The Kativik regional government and the police force have not commented on the events, citing the ongoing court case.","Assault occurred in a tiny Inuit village, northern Quebec, in 2011 .

"A gang of Conservative MPs tried to sabotage the filming of a ground-breaking documentary in Parliament by plotting to trip up a cameraman. The group of ‘right wing Tories’ had been incensed by the decision to allow the acclaimed film-maker Michael Cockerell to film their activities inside the House of Commons for a year. It was revealed yesterday that Commons officials got wind of a scheme last year to disrupt filming while all MPs were packed into the chamber to watch Prime Minister’s Questions. Scroll down for video . Cameras were allowed on to the floor of the Commons chamber for the first time to capture PMQs as MPs see it . The presence of a film crew angered traditionalists who tried to sabotage the documentary . David Cameron is seen turning to listen to a question from Tory MP Charlotte Leslie during Prime Minister's Questions . The MPs hoped to force the Speaker, John Bercow, to halt proceedings and to scupper the rest of the project but their plot was foiled at the last minute by Parliament’s security chief, the Serjeant-at-Arms. Mr Cockerell, who has interviewed a record eight Prime Ministers, was allowed to film the corridors of power where cameras have always been forbidden, only after six years of painstaking negotiations with the Parliamentary authorities. The four-part series ‘Inside the Commons’ which begins next Tuesday on BBC2, involved nearly 600 hours of filming. His team follow MPs, ministers, David Cameron and Ed Miliband, and the army of behind-the-scenes staff who keep the House running, from the waitress who sings as she serves the members’ tea to the Hawker who keeps the pigeons off the nineteenth century stonework. One scene involved filming with drones to capture the spectacle of the four-man abseiling team who, every five years, are deployed to clean and fix up the clock face of Big Ben. His footage inside the corridors of the eighteenth century building shows the rack where MPs from times past could store their swords. To his surprise, one solitary wooden sword is hanging up. Mr Cockerell said the editing was intended to be ‘mischievous’. Documentary makers were allowed to film in the corridors only after six years of painstaking negotiations with the Parliamentary authorities . Michael Cockerell revealed a group of ‘right wing Tories’ had been incensed by the decision to allow the cameras in . The four-part series ‘Inside the Commons’ which begins next Tuesday on BBC2, involved nearly 600 hours of filming .

And Tory MP Andrew Percy reveals the emailed list of ‘free hit’ questions which are MPs are sent by Number 10 aides to ask at PMQs, involving jobs and economic growth. Mr Percy explains that the purpose is for the MP to mention the Conservatives’ ‘long term economic plan’ if they are picked to ask a question, and his fellow MP Andrew Selous is shown doing just that. But the veteran broadcaster revealed that not all MPs were supportive of the project, and a small number declined to take part altogether. Last year Tory MP Bill Wiggin was seen on television protesting to the Speaker that the cameras were getting in the way of members watching the session – and was slapped down. Former Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers, pictured in the chamber, took early retirement after clashing with Speaker John Bercow . Robin Fell, the principle doorkeeper of the House of Commons, oversees the running of the Chamber . The first episode follows Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who was first elected in May 2010 . Sarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, also speaks about the difficulties finding her feet after being elected . However Mr Cockerell said he became aware another group had plotted to disrupt the entire project. ‘There were occasional times when MPs on the naughty bench, right up at the back on the right, weren’t very pleased with our presence’, he said. ‘ There was a plan by some backbenchers which was thwarted by the man in charge of security. The doorkeepers are the eyes and ears of this place and they understood what was apparently planned. ‘It was right wing Tories, but I won’t be fingering anyone by name. We chose a place for the cameraman, on the two sides of the House where we wouldn’t get in the way, so we could get a shot at eye level which you couldn’t get from the high cameras. And apparently, after many months of negotiations, some people thought we still shouldn’t be there. ‘You could see where the cameraman and if you leant backwards, maybe the cameraman would go backwards, I don’t know I’m not privy to the details. But they averted it.’ The first episode follows two new MPs elected in 2010, Charlotte Leslie, the Tory MP for Bristol North West and Sarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham as they find their feet. David Cameron and Ed Miliband talk about their experience of PMQs, with the Prime Minister saying: ‘About five minutes beforehand you think, ‘Have I got to do this again?’ The Labour leader says: ‘I find the anticipation is worse than the reality.’ The series will also have revelations about the rumoured clash between Mr Bercow and the Clerk of the House Sir Robert Rogers – who explains the growing challenges of running the crumbling building - shortly before Sir Robert suddenly announced his early retirement.","Cameras allowed in to Parliament only after six years of negotiations .

"It is one of the most poignant moments of modern British history – the dipping of cranes in silent tribute as Winston Churchill’s coffin passes down the Thames. But there was shock last night after a former docker cast doubt on the spontaneity of the occasion by claiming the workers had to be paid. John Lynch, a dock man in 1965, made the claim in Jeremy Paxman’s BBC1 documentary, Churchill: The Nation’s Farewell. Scroll down for video . A former docker claimed that workers were paid to dip the cranes in silent tribute to Winston Churchill as his coffin passed down The Thames . He said: ‘They [the dockers] didn’t like Churchill. I think I can speak for most, they didn’t like him. When they were asked to do it the atmosphere was “no”. They were paid to do it. We didn’t work Saturday afternoon, we wouldn’t have been there. ‘There was a lot of arguments and rows about it. The atmosphere was that Churchill wasn’t a working class person. You’d see him with a cigar in one hand and sometimes a drink in the other, he just didn’t associate with us at all.’ However, Mr Lynch added: ‘I was [moved by it]. I didn’t like Churchill but I was moved by the gesture. I was moved by the whole funeral.’ Winston Churchill pictured with his trademark cigar . After his death from a stroke on January 24, 1965, the wartime prime minister’s coffin was carried from Westminster Hall where it had lain in state for three days to St Paul’s Cathedral. More than a hundred nations sent representatives, making it the largest state funeral up to that point. The procession then took to the Thames where the Havengore launch carried it from Tower Pier to Festival Pier. As the boat went down the river the cranes lowered in what has always been described as a spontaneous tribute. Last night viewers reacted with disbelief at the claim. Annette De Rohan, from Dorset, said: ‘It was shocking to include these claims in an otherwise superb documentary even if there was some truth in them. ‘This attacks the reputation of a great man who we should be holding up to young people as an example. It was very petty.’ Another viewer Angus Fanshawe tweeted: ‘Brilliant and moving Paxman documentary on Churchill funeral. But upset cranes bowing down was not a genuine gesture.’ Historian Guy Walters said: ‘The dock workers at the time were a notorious bunch of hardline socialists, and not all of them would have been the greatest fans of a Tory former prime minister.’ But he added: ‘The fact is, Winston did bring the nation together unlike any other politician.’","Cranes were dipped as Churchill's coffin passed along the River Thames .

"The mother of a disabled teenage boy said her son was 'embarrassed and mortified' after she was forced to drag him to the bathroom because there was no wheelchair on board. Virgin Australia has apologised after the incident involving Heike Fabig's son Kai, who is now 14, on board VA 183 from Sydney to Nadi, Fiji on September 28. But a furious Ms Fabig said that was not good enough and is demanding a wheelchair on board every flight. Scroll down for video . Kai, 14, pictured with his mother Heike Fabig, suffers from spastic paraplegia and the rare disorder Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy . She said some staff on board the flight even suggested she change Kai's nappy in his seat - in front of other passengers. 'It just beggars belief,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Don't these people have children? 'I don't want a voucher, I don't want points, I want an aisle chair on every flight - specifically if there is a wheelchair user on board.' Airlines often keep aisle wheelchairs on board for people with injuries or disabilities to transport themselves around the aircraft. On a flight from Sydney to Fiji, Ms Fabig was forced to drag her son to the bathroom due to Virgin Australia failing to include an aisle wheelchair on board the plane . Ms Fabig said her family had contacted the airline in the weeks prior to the incident and an official had assured them an aisle chair would be made available for Kai . Ms Fabig said her family had contacted the airline in the weeks prior to the incident and an official had assured them an aisle chair would be made available for Kai. But two hours into the flight, a flight attendant informed her there wasn't one on board. Kai has hereditary spastic paraplegia and the rare disorder Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy. He developed symptoms of the disorder in April 2014. It has left him incontinent and unable to walk. After tense discussions, she eventually carried her 50kg son the short distance to the toilet. Despite  the airline offering an apology (left) to her and her son (right), a furious Ms Fabig said: 'I don't want a voucher, I don't want points, I want an aisle chair on every flight - specifically if there is a wheelchair user on board' 'I had to sort of carry-drag him along,' she said. 'They're actually really good in getting you onto the plane (via wheelchair). 'Once you're there you can just pee your pants.' She said a concerned flight attendant wrote up an incident report and assured her there would be an aisle wheelchair on the return flight. However, 'on the return flight, the same thing happened'. Virgin sent Ms Fabig's family an apologetic email and have pledged to investigate the incident. She said a concerned flight attendant wrote up an incident report and assured her there would be an aisle wheelchair on the return flight. However, 'on the return flight, the same thing happened' The email said: 'I apologise on behalf of the Virgin Group of airlines for the stress and inconvenience caused to you and your son. 'As per our discussion we do take this matter very seriously. 'However, whilst we remain focused on obtaining an outcome, I'm unable to provide a specific date for resolution.' Pictured with Prime Minister Tony Abbott in 2014, Ms Fabig and Kai are considering taking the matter to the Human Rights Commission . A spokeswoman for Virgin Australia told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was currently being investigated and that 'the business is working hard to rectify the situation'. 'Virgin Australia has sincerely apologised to the guest for any inconvenience caused in this situation and we are in contact with the guest regarding this matter.

"If you’ve ever wanted to break into your partner’s email, or access a friend’s Facebook account, you can now pay a hacker to do it for you. A controversial website named Hacker's List matches hackers with members of the public who need help accessing sensitive information. On the anonymously set up site, a so-called 'employer' posts what task they need carried out and hackers then bid for the work. Hacker’s List (pictured) is believed to be registered in New Zealand. It lets hacker’s bid for assignments posted by other users, called ‘employers’. An employer describes what hacking task they need doing, as well a budget, and hackers bid for the work. The identities of the people who found the site have not been revealed . It adds a new spin to the current trend of freelancing sites on which people can offer services such as DIY, copywriting, data processing, and more in exchange for a fee. All members are listed anonymously, but have to provide an email and physical address during the registration process. However a user could, in theory, get round revealing their identity by using a PO Box address and an alias, for example.

When a user registers, they choose to be either a 'hacker' or an 'employer.' An employer describes what hacking task they need doing and a budget. Registered hackers then bid for tasks, and an employer selects who to work with. The site explained that it has dispute resolution specialists if a job fails, that all payments are discreet and it uses ‘strict privacy controls’.

Jobs range from logging into school and university databases to change grades, hacking into email and Facebook accounts to see if someone is cheating, or removing defamatory blog posts and images. Hacker’s List also has a Twitter account, using the handle @hackerslist, where it posts new hacking assignments. One assignment on the site reads: ‘Seeking authentic professional with capabilities for two things: Remove content and image from online, or de-index online report. 'Either of these will be acceptable. ‘This assignment is very, very crucial to me and as such only individuals with experience and capabilities should contact this ad.’ This employer is offering between $300 (£198) and $4,000 (£2,640) for the job. Another reads: ‘Defamatory blog post removal de-indexing: A blog comes up on Google. 'It quoted defamatory information from 20 years ago and [is] now costing me jobs, business and my kids to be bullied. ‘Need this permanently solved by being dropped from [number one] on search.’ The site said: ‘Hiring a hacker shouldn't be a difficult process. ‘At Hacker's List we want to make the process simple and worry free. ‘We want to make everyone as comfortable as possible when it comes to payments, privacy and quality of work.’ Some of the jobs being posted on Hacker’s List are illegal, such as accessing email and Facebook accounts without permission, but the site told the New York Times that it is 'insulated from any legal liability because [it] neither endorses nor condones illegal activities.’ The specific laws under which they are governed depend on the country in which the activity is taking place. And its terms and conditions say use of the service ‘for any illegal purposes, including, without limitation, prostitution and/or solicitation’ is forbidden.

But the site explained it has dispute resolution specialists if a job fails, that all payments are discreet, and it uses ‘strict privacy controls’. Some critics believe the site could also be a hoax. Raj Samani, EMEA chief technology officer at Intel Security said: 'The introduction of Hackers List is further evidence that today’s cybercriminals require no technical knowledge, as the necessary technical skills can easily be outsourced. 'Regarding this particular site there have been question marks regarding its authenticity, but it does clearly demonstrate the general demand in hiring hackers.' Computer security expert Graham Cluely told MailOnline: ‘It's clear from a quick perusal of Hacker’s List that although there are, without doubt, some ethical hackers and penetration testers up there who are acting within the law, it is also a thriving marketplace for computer crime. ‘Hacker's List is a site for those with no ethics and no IT skills.’ He said that he gets emails from internet users asking how to hack their way back into accounts, and some ask how to hack into their partner’s accounts. ‘Of course, all of these activities are illegal and offences under computer crime laws,’ continued Mr Cluely. ‘Hacker's List's acceptable use policy claims that you cannot use its services for any activities which breaks the law, it relies on users reporting abuse rather than actively policing and vetting postings. ‘Of course, it shouldn't be forgotten, Hacker's List makes money every time a job is completed. ‘If hacking Facebook accounts and attacking websites are among the most common listings on the site, they may be very tempted to turn a blind eye to such activities as it helps the site's owners earn cash.’ Meanwhile, Raj Samani, EMEA chief technology officer at Intel Security said: The introduction of Hackers List is further evidence that today’s cybercriminals require no technical knowledge, as the necessary technical skills can easily be outsourced. 'Regarding this particular site there have been question marks regarding its authenticity, but it does clearly demonstrate the general demand in hiring hackers.' David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab added: 'There’s a whole cybercrime eco-system that underpins the development of malicious code - a criminal reflection of the legitimate economy. 'So it’s no surprise that there’s a ‘human resources’ aspect to this too, made up of people looking for people to write code and coders looking for jobs. 'This type of site isn’t new, although typically such activities take place ‘below the radar’, rather than using web sites that are plainly visible.

Firms will hire hackers to attempt to infiltrate their networks and highlight flaws. As long as the request comes from the site owner, this is legal.

"Some of England's most unusual office blocks, including several with a futuristic spaceship-style design, have been given listed status. The 14 buildings all date from after the Second World War, and were listed at Grade II as part of a drive by English Heritage to recognise a new generation of architecture - much of which was controversial when it was built. The organisation praised the way that architects have responded to 'radical changes' in the way offices work, with a shift towards open-plan space dominated by rows of computers. Scroll down for video . Listed: Mountbatten House, known as the 'Hanging Gardens of Basingstoke', is now officially a Grade II listed building . Protection: IBM's British headquarters in Cosham, Hampshire is another building to have been given official legal protection . Multi-storey: 30 Cannon Street in London, left, and Birmingham's Alpha Tower, right, are two of the taller buildings to be listed . Protection: MEA House in Newcastle was listed as part of the new drive to defend modern office buildings from demolition . Among the buildings listed are 30 Cannon Street in the City of London, a sleek black with rounded curves just around the corner from St Paul's Cathedral. Also given listed status is Civil Aviation Authority House - formerly Space House - in London, designed by the architect behind the Centre Point tower. The 'Hanging Gardens of Basingstoke' - Mountbatten House and its roof gardens - have both been listed, with the gardens given grade II status on the register of parks and gardens. IBM's British headquarters in Cosham, Hampshire, designed by the firm of Norman Foster, is also now protected from destruction thanks to its listing. Innovative: Gun Wharf in Chatham, Kent was built for Lloyd's of London but is now the headquarters of Medway Council . Brutalist: The Gun Wharf office block was built using exposed brick in a style popular in the 1970s . Unusual: 1 Finsbury Avenue in central London, built by Arup Associates, is on the list of buildings protected from significant alteration . Pavilions: The former Central Electricity Generating Board in Bristol has been honoured for its architectural importance . Sleek: St James's House in Birmingham, whose exterior is on the left and interior is pictured right, has also been listed . Four of the 14 office blocks are in London, two in Birmingham, two in Newcastle and the other six distributed around other major cities and suburban areas. A number of other buildings were also considered for listing but ultimately rejected, including Tower 42, formerly known as the Natwest Tower, which is one of the most prominent skyscrapers in the City of London. Listed buildings cannot be altered or demolished without explicit permission from the local planning authority, which often consults central government before allowing any changes. The rules state that buildings are only eligible for listing 30 years after they were built - meaning that all of the newly listed office blocks date from before 1985. Under-rated? The Twentieth Century Society argues that buildings like the former office of Ryder and Yates in Newcastle need more protection . Futuristic: Space House in Holborn, central London, left, and the former Midland Bank in Liverpool, right, share aspects of their design . Controversial: Buildings like Bank House in Leeds, pictured, are not to everyone's taste despite their new status . Geometric: Bank House is constructed from interlocking rectangles which overhang the street below . Garden: Another view of Mountbatten House in Basingstoke, whose garden has been listed as well as the building itself . The Twentieth Century Society argues that more protection is needed for modern buildings, because they are often given a lower priority than more historic structures despite their architectural importance. Culture minister Ed Vaizey, who approved English Heritage's recommendation over the listings, said: 'Listed buildings are not just about historic houses and ancient monuments, they also serve to protect our recent heritage and preserve the best examples of our fantastic architecture. 'This group of listings reflect the changing face of our working environment and represent the very best in design and it's entirely right that they be listed grade II.' Roger Bowdler of English Heritage added: 'These offices show how architecture has adapted to recent radical changes in how we work. 'They show how the open-plan working space for computer-led work came about, and how architects responded to the need for lettable, attractive spaces with ingenuity and a deep understanding of human needs.'

His wish was granted, and as well as being made a uniform, he travelled by police helicopter and became Arizona’s first and only honorary DPS officer. The youngster passed away only a day later, but from these roots, the programme came into being.","Both girls are suffering from retinoblastoma, a form of cancer .

"A middle aged couple dropped off a newborn baby girl still covered in amniotic fluid to a Lakewood, Colorado fire station on Tuesday after it was given to them at a Walmart. The baby didn't belong to the couple but was given to them by strangers at a Lakewood Walmart parking lot that morning. The fire department did not reveal any more details about the baby's biological parents but they do not believe that the middle-aged couple knew them in any way. Abandoned baby: A mother gave her newborn baby daughter, still covered in amniotic fluid, to a middle-aged couple at the Walmart in Lakewood, Colorado . Khou reports that the baby, while not wiped off, seemed healthy but was given to paramedics to ensure its safety. 'The child didn’t look like it had been completely cleaned off. Still had some amniotic fluid dried on. It just had the appearance of a baby that had just been born very recently,' said firefighter and paramedic Cody Beinlich. A law passed in Colorado called The Safe Haven Law makes it legal for the parents of an unwanted child to drop in at a hospital or fire station up to 72 hours after the birth. Any longer than 72 hours and a parent can face up to 26 years in prison. Even though the baby was dropped at a fire station, it was not delivered by the parents and therefore is not fully covered in the law. Police are searching for the baby's mother both over concerns about her health and because charges may be warranted against her. The baby's mother committed a crime of abandonment. Safe Haven:The middle-aged couple dropped off the newborn at West Metro Fire Station 1  in Lakewood who then sent the baby to the hospital for treatment . Linda Prudhomme who works with the Colorado Safe Haven for Newborns, told ABC News that since the law passed in 2000, 40 babies have been safely taken into care. 'If the couple who dropped the baby off are relatives or the parents of the baby — and made up the story about the mother in the parking lot — then the circumstances fall under the Safe Haven Law. If it is determined that the baby was legally abandoned, police will write a report but will not pursue the mother,' she said. Prudhomme said that the baby's actual mother didn’t correctly abide by the law. 'If a parent handed over the child to total strangers and they took it to a fire station, then the parent could be charged criminally, but that part of the story has not been substantiated,' said Steve Davis with the police department. Firefighters do not know the future of the baby but they said that they will always remember the bizarre day she was dropped off at their station and that the wish her the best in what's to come.","A  couple dropped off a newborn baby girl still covered in amniotic fluid to a  Colorado fire station on Tuesday after it was given to them at a Walmart .

"Google has come under fire from investors after its earnings were well below analysts' predictions for the fifth consecutive quarter. It reported fourth-quarter profits of $4.76bn (£3.16bn), up nearly 30% from the same period a year before, but revenue missed Wall Street expectations. The tech giant is frustrating investors who believe the online search leader would be more profitable it wasn't pouring so much money into far-flung projects such as Internet-connected eyewear and driverless cars. Scroll down for video . Google discontinued the Glass Explorer program on January 19, after wearers were ridiculed as 'glassholes' The firm even admitted it needed to 'reset' its Google Glass eyewear after a poor public reaction. Google's Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette said :'When teams aren't able to leap hurdles, but we think there's still a lot of promise, we might ask them to take a pause and take the time to reset their strategy, as we recently did in the case of Glass,' Google discontinued the Glass Explorer program on January 19, after announcing it would shut down and be reassigned to Tony Fadell's consumer hardware department within the company. He also revealed the firm had struggled to meet demand for the Nexus 6 handset. 'We also faced a few real challenges as well' for the quarter, Pichette said. 'While the Nexus 6 was very well received as a new phone, we had real issues and were unable to secure sufficient inventory to meet the demand that we had forecasted.' The earnings were well below analysts' predictions, marking the fifth consecutive quarter that Google hasn't cleared a key hurdle for publicly held companies. The Mountain View, California, company earned $4.8 billion, or $6.91 per share, a 41 percent increase from the same period in 2013. If not for certain expenses and gains, Google said it would have earned $6.88 per share. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of $7.12 per share, according to FactSet. Google's revenue for the period covering the holiday shopping season rose 15 percent to $18.1 billion. After subtracting ad commissions, revenue stood at $14.5 billion - nearly $250 million below analysts' expectations. Investors expressed their dismay as Google's stock sank $10.31, or 2 percent, to $502.92 in extended trading. Even before that sell-off, the shares had dropped by 8 percent from where they stood just 13 months ago. The downturn has primarily been driven by two factors: Google's steadily rising expenses while the company's main digital advertising business is facing more challenges as a growing audience relies on smartphones instead of desktop and laptop computers to do searches and peruse digital content. The firm had struggled to meet demand for the Nexus 6 handset . Ad prices have been sagging because marketers haven't been willing to pay as much to pitch consumers who are squinting at the smaller screens on smartphones, an issue that cropped up again during the final three months of last year. Google registered a 3 percent decline in the average price for the ads that appear alongside its search results and other online content, a measure known as 'cost per click.' It's the 13th consecutive quarter that Google's cost-per-click has fallen from the previous year. The desktop-to-mobile transition also unleashed a flood of applications that make it easier for people to go directly to the digital content that they want, instead of searching on Google. People are also searching within apps once they're in them, relying on services such as Amazon to find products or Yelp to find restaurants. That trend may help explain why the revenue-generating clicks on Google's ads have been growing at a slower rate. The volume of activity is important because Google bills advertisers when people click on a promotional link. Google's paid clicks during the fourth quarter rose 14 percent from the same time in 2013.

The firm admitted it needed to 'reset' its Google Glass eyewear after a poor public reaction. Google could still be making more money if the company decided to add fewer workers to its payroll and rein in its spending on far-out technology. But CEO Larry Page believes Google needs to continue be taking risks and making big bets on ambitious ideas that he calls 'moonshots' in an effort to open future moneymaking opportunities and perhaps make the world a better place. Page, who is Google's controlling shareholder with fellow co-founder Sergey Brin, warned investors when Google went public in 2004 the company would continually invest for the long term instead of trying to make as money as possible from one quarter to next.

"Andy Murray has jumped to the defence of his fiancée Kim Sears after she appeared to launch a furious tirade at his opponent during his Australian Open semi-final victory. In one of several heated moments during the clash, the usually poised 27-year-old appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Czech player Tomas Berdych. As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k’. Scroll down for video . Kim Sears (pictured left and right) appeared to unleash the tirade as she watched Andy Murray do battle in the Australian Open semi-final . In the X-rated rant, the 27-year-old appeared to say 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f**k' as the camera put her on the big screen . Ms Sears was also facing a tennis WAG-off against Tomas Berdych's tanned model partner Ester Satorova (pictured left and right), who looked less impressed as the match developed . The clip, which was recorded after the camera zoomed in on Ms Sears, sent Twitter into meltdown, with hundreds both amused and shocked by the outburst from Murray's usually-demure other half. But speaking after the game, Murray said the seemingly uncharacteristic episode was down to 'a lot of tension' whipped up before the match. He told reporters: 'When there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, which you created, then it's completely normal. 'The whole first set, everyone was tight. My physical trainer, physio, I'm sure for Dani it was uncomfortable. 'Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that's it.' The dramatic outburst came as Murray won a tense baseline rally in the first set to claim a break back against world number 7. Luckily, there were no microphones nearby to pick up her exact choice of colourful words - but it was evident Ms Sears was deeply invested in the match. The highly-charged match was the first time Murray and Berdych had come head-to-head since the latter hired Murray's former trainer Dani Vallverdu. Ms Sears was caught on camera using colourful language as Murray secured a break in the third set to put himself firmly in control of the match with Czech Tomas Berdych. He won the game in four sets . The pair met for the tenth time in today's march. Berdych is now coached by Murray's former coach Dani Vallverdu, which made for an extra tense occasion . Mr Vallverdu helped Murray win his two grand slam titles and an Olympic gold before they stopped working together in November. The dynamic dominated the pre-match build-up, despite both players trying to quietly play down tensions between the two camps. But there was no doubt that it added a fiery edge to the match, with Murray admitting afterwards that there had been acrimonious mood around Melbourne Park. Murray eventually beat the Czech in four sets, earning himself a spot in the coveted final this weekend. Speaking on court, he said: 'A lot was made of Dani working with him. We've been friends since we were 15 and I felt like that was a bit unfair and unnecessary. 'This is sport, there is more to life and I thought it was unfair and created a bit of extra tension. Berdych had won six of the 10 matches between him and Murray (pictured during today's game) and beat Rafael Nadal for the first time in nine years in the last eight - but Murray kept up his impeccable form . Murray, pictured during today's game, will now compete in the final at Melbourne Park for the fourth time . It was the first time Murray had played Berdych (pictured) since he hired Murray's former coach, which no doubt added a fiery edge to the match . 'It was there definitely at the beginning but I think everyone calmed down after the start of the match.' But the Scot also used his victory to heap praise on his coach, Amelie Mauresmo. He said: 'A lot of people criticised me for working with her and I think so far this week we have showed women can be very good coaches as well. 'Madison Keys, who reached the semi-finals here, is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward so I am very thankful to Amelie for doing it. 'I would say it was a brave choice from her and hopefully I can repay her in a few days.' Meanwhile, on the sidelines, Ms Sears was facing a tennis WAG-off against Berdych's tanned model partner Ester Satorova for the second day running. Much has been made of the rivalry between the two women, both of whom have recently got engaged to their tennis pros. Murray and Berdych both proposed to their respective girlfriends  recently before presenting them with expensive diamond rings. U.S television coverage further built up the so-called 'battle of the bling', with ESPN displaying a split screen of Sears and Satorova, with added captions at the bottom showing the estimated worth of their rings . Kim's £250K ring . Kim's ring: . Kim Sears’s ring (seen yesterday during Murray’s match) is said to be platinum featuring a brilliant-cut diamond of around 3.5 carats, surrounded by smaller stones. Diamonds in the shoulders of the ring take the weight up to around 4.7 carats. Its estimated value for insurance purposes is £250,000. Ester's £225K ring . Ester's ring: . Ester Satorova’s design (pictured yesterday) is thought to be handmade from platinum. It has a square-cut centre diamond of around four carats, set with a pair of baguette stones, taking the total to around 5.3 carats. Its estimated value for insurance purposes is £225,000. The British No 1 proposed to Sears, his girlfriend of nine years last year with a 3.5 carat platinum diamond ring, which he is said to have selected himself. Murray's engagement ring to Sears has been valued at around £250,000 while Berdych's love token is estimated to be worth around £225,000 . U.S television coverage further built up the so-called 'battle of the bling', with ESPN displaying another split screen of Sears and Satorova, with added captions at the bottom showing the estimated worth of their rings. A 50-50 split screen was shown of Sears and Berdych's fiancee Ester Satorova, after which Ms Sears appeared to mouth: 'Oh for f**k sake.' Back on court, after coming out on top in a long exchange in the first set, Murray turned in the direction of Vallverdu, who sitting in his opponent's box, and let out a wild roar in celebration. Berdych was clearly incensed, giving the Scot a long stare as both players walked back to their courtside chair. Then, as Murray sat down, he pumped his fist towards his own box, to which Sears responded with a fist pump of her own. The pair, both 27, had been together for nine years when Murray proposed in November last year . Moments later, Berdych complained to umpire Pascal Maria about the quality of the tennis balls, to which Murray responded: 'He always does this.' As Murray let out some expletives in annoyance at his own play, the big screens in Rod Laver Arena further added to the drama. It then came to a head between Murray and Berdych after the latter claimed a 76-minute first set. But Murray quickly hit back on the court, putting on a convincing display as he clinched the remaining sets 6-0, 6-3, 7-5. Afterwards,the handshake between the pair at the net was surprisingly civil. But Berdych later said: 'I'm really not happy and not really in a good mood. I'm very disappointed to lose this match. I had one bad set for the second set, and that's it.'","Rant came as Ms Sears watched Murray's victory at Melbourne Park today .

"A U.S. scientist who promised to build 40 nuclear weapons for Venezuela and design a bomb targeting New York City has been sentenced to five years in jail. Pedro Leonardo Mascheroni, 79, told an undercover FBI agent that he would build the weapons of mass destruction over a ten year period in in exchange for 'money and power'. Mascheroni, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Argentina, told the agent, posing as a Venezuelan official, that the bombs would prevent the U.S. from invading the oil-rich nation,  according to secret FBI recordings released Wednesday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jailed: Pedro Leonardo Mascheroni has been jailed for offering to help develop nuclear weapons for Venezuela through dealings with an undercover FBI agent posing as a representative of the country . 'I'm going to be the boss with money and power,' the former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist is heard saying. 'I'm not an American anymore. This is it.' Mascheroni said his New York bomb wouldn't kill anyone but would disable the city's electrical system and help Venezuela become a nuclear superpower. It was not known how realistic his New York bombing idea was. But he suggested that once Venezuela obtained a bomb, the country should explode it 'to let the world know what we've got,' according to the recordings. The recordings were played Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Albuquerque before a federal judge sentenced Mascheroni, 79, to five years in prison followed by three years of supervised release as part of a plea agreement. Mascheroni and his wife, Marjorie Roxby Mascheroni, pleaded guilty in 2013 to offering to help develop a nuclear weapon for Venezuela through dealings with an undercover FBI agent posing as a representative of the South American country. The U.S. government did not allege Venezuela sought U.S. secrets. Marjorie Roxby Mascheroni, center, was sentenced to 366 days in prison for conspiring with her husband to sell nuclear secrets . Facilities used to store low-level radioactive waste at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, pictured 2000 . His wife received a year and a day in prison for conspiring with her husband to sell nuclear secrets. The U.S. government did not allege Venezuela sought U.S. secrets. Despite the evidence and the plea agreement, federal prosecutor Fred Federici said Pedro Mascheroni refused to admit he did anything wrong and has tried to argue that he was the victim of the federal government trying to trap him after being critical of U.S. nuclear policy. 'He was no true hero,' Federici said. 'He was simply a man who betrayed his country.' Speaking to a judge, Mascheroni was defiant and said that if his case had gone to trial, a federal jury would have acquitted him. He said the information he passed onto the agent was already available online or simply was made up. 'I was basically selling used cars,' Mascheroni said during a long tirade in federal court that had to be interrupted by U.S. District Judge William P. Johnson. 'What I was selling was completely science fiction.' Before his indictment, Mascheroni was under investigation for about a year. The FBI had seized computers, letters, photographs, books and cellphones from the couple's Los Alamos home. In an interview Mascheroni said he believed the U.S. government was wrongly targeting him as a spy and denied the accusations. The scientist said he approached Venezuela after the United States rejected his theories that a hydrogen-fluoride laser could produce nuclear energy. Mascheroni worked in the nuclear weapons design division at the Los Alamos lab from 1979 until he was laid off in 1988. His wife, a technical writer, worked there between 1981 and 2010.","Pedro Mascheroni, 79, said he would build weapons for Venezuela .

"Unemployed mother-of-two Christina Briggs, 26, from Wigan, last year caused uproar by saying she felt taxpayers should give her more benefits to eat healthily. But she now admits she got it wrong . Last year, an obese mother-of-two on benefits caused a media storm after claiming she needed more taxpayers money in order to overhaul her unhealthy lifestyle. Christina Briggs, 26, from Wigan, told This Morning in September that she hated being 25 stone but she couldn't do anything about it because she can only afford junk food and doesn't have enough cash for a gym membership. But after spending three weeks with a dietitian, Christina has done a complete U-turn and now admits that she was 'stupid' to think that it is expensive to eat well. After overhauling her diet by limiting processed foods and loading up on with fresh fruit and vegetables, Christina  has both lost 1st 5lbs and saved cash. Now weighing 23st 9lbs, Christina returned to the ITV programme earlier today to show off her weight loss. She said: 'I feel a lot healthier. My back doesn't hurt anymore when I walk. 'I'm really determined now. 'I've bought myself a FitBit and I go out for a walk each morning and evening.' Christina, who is unemployed, rarely left the house until recently, but she now walks around 20,000 steps a day. Her improved lifestyle isn't hurting her bank balance either - she revealed today that she often walks out of the supermarket with change from her £40 weekly food budget. Christina confessed: 'I was stupid thinking it's expensive when it's not.' 'At first I did find it hard but the more I get into it, I'm finding it easier and easier. 'The kids love the food. They love coming to help in the kitchen, especially my daughter Helena. Miss Briggs appeared on This Morning last September, claiming that she couldn't afford to eat heathily . Christina was given three weeks personalised advice from expert dietitian Evelyn Toner (pictured right) After Christina appeared on This Morning, the show's producers arranged for dietitian Evelyn Toner to visit her Wigan home to analyse her weekly shop. Christina's weekly haul of crisps, biscuits, white bread and microwave meals totalled just £35 and she is seen telling Evelyn: 'This is what the government don't understand. Unhealthy food is actually a lot cheaper.' Christina then tries a healthy supermarket shop; but she ends up with a bill of £140, drastically over budget. However, dietitian Evelyn then shows Christina how to do a shop for her family of four for just £38, by planning meals ahead and bulk cooking. Evelyn provided a list of meals for Christina to chose from, including pizza using wholemeal pitta bread, homemade spaghetti Bolognese and homemade chicken in breadcrumbs with oven baked potato wedges . Christina also enrolled in a 'Food Positive' programme to help her learn how to cook from scratch. She said: 'I've learnt that by budgeting healthy food, you can do it. I didn't need all that food in my trolley every week.' Christina lost 10lbs in the three-week experiment and has continued to follow Evelyn's diet plan, losing a further 10lbs so far. Evelyn gave Christina advice on planning meals ahead as well as budget healthy eating . Tips like being taught the correct portion control have helped Christina lose over a stone . Her new attitude is a marked change to her first appearance on This Morning when she claimed she needed more money from the government in order to improve her health. Weighing 25st and at a size 26, the single mother told Closer Magazine: 'It's not easy being overweight and on benefits. If I was well off, I'd be able to buy fresh food and afford a gym membership. 'I tried swimming but it cost £22 a month and it meant I had to cut back on my favourite pizza and Chinese takeaways.' Unemployed Christina gets £20,000 in benefits a year and lives in a council house with her two children by different fathers, Helena, 10, and Robert, two.

"A small aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing on a snowy highway in New Jersey this afternoon due to a suspected mechanical failure. Christopher Okechukwu, 51, a doctor and father-of-three from Paramus, was traveling solo to Lincoln Park Airport when the incident occurred. Despite icy conditions, the pilot of 15 years managed to make a safe landing on the tarmac below and no injuries were reported. He decided to go with the flow of traffic and touched down on a clear stretch of road behind a truck and car. The Federal Aviation Administration said Okechukwu's Cessna C150 - built in 1976 - landed on Route 23 in West Milford. He took the decision to dock it after he heard a 'sputtering' noise in flight. No vehicles were hit by the plane and the aircraft did not appear to sustain any major damage. It landed around 1pm and was removed from the highway via a flatbed truck around 2:30pm.

"Barely a day goes by without a new claim for the miraculous beauty benefits of virgin coconut oil. ‘Virgin’ means it is made from the first pressing of fresh, raw coconut with no chemicals added. If you believe the hype, almost every product in your bathroom cabinet could be replaced with the stuff. Think of the savings! Gwyneth Paltrow and Sadie Frost apparently wash out their mouths with it, and supermodel Gisele Bundchen says she uses it on her skin after being in the sun. Angelina Jolie is said to eat it for breakfast and fellow actress Blake Lively rubs it into the ends of her hair. Solid and waxy-looking in the jar, it melts to an oil as soon as you handle it and is said to leave skin butter-soft. Scroll down for video . A firm favourite with celebrities, Gwyneth Paltrow and Sadie Frost apparently wash out their mouths with it, and supermodel Gisele Bundchen says she uses it on her skin after being in the sun . There are countless websites devoted to the wonder oil, claiming it can successfully treat everything from stretch marks and cellulite to mosquito bites, sunburn and acne. The lauric acid in it is credited with antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties, hence its popularity as an oral rinse. Yet despite the surge in demand for coconut oil (sales up 442 per cent at Sainsbury’s last year), there is little scientific data on its health benefits. So are we right to be nuts about it? I decided to put the beauty claims to the test. I would have my hair, mouth and skin analysed by experts, then replace my usual beauty products for a month with Groovy Food Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, £5.99 for 283ml jar at Waitrose. Here’s what happened . . . MAKE-UP REMOVER . Groovy Food Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, £5.99 for 283ml jar at Waitrose . Method: I put a penny-sized blob on two cotton wool pads and use it to remove eye-make up at night. Celebrity make-up artist Oonagh Connor says: ‘I’m already a fan of coconut oil. It’s great for getting make-up off — particularly waterproof eye make-up.’ Results: Oonagh says the coconut oil is working well for me. ‘It’s thick and can clog pores, so the trick is to use as little as possible. A tiny spot of coconut oil will lift off quite a lot of eye make-up.’ Will I Switch? Definitely. It lifts off make-up more easily than my usual oily make-up remover and leaves the area around my eyes feeling nicely moisturised, too. THICK, SHINY HAIR . Method: I find most hair conditioners make my thin hair look greasy, so I stick to using it on the dry ends. I follow the same routine with the coconut oil. Dr Elena Dimitrova, a clinical dermatologist and expert in hair loss at The Belgravia Centre in London, says: ‘Coconut oil may well prove useful in smoothing the hair shaft and improving texture, but it can’t create hair roots or halt hair loss caused by, say, hormones. So I’m sceptical that it will make your hair feel thicker. ‘Your hair is in very good condition and your pull test [a light pull which, in healthy hair, should cause no more than five hairs to come out] is within normal range.’ Results: Dr Dimitrova says: ‘You don’t have additional hair growth — I didn’t think you would — but the existing hair has been maintained in excellent condition even though you haven’t cut it. ‘After a month I would typically expect to see more hair breakage than this, so coconut oil has definitely been a good conditioner for your hair.’ Will I Switch? Not entirely. I’ll be keeping my usual conditioner because I usually blow-dry my hair after washing and the oil doesn’t work well with heat. As I discover the hard way, heat breaks down the oil and creates an extremely unpleasant smell. But I’ll keep using the oil as an occasional leave-in conditioner at night. LUSH LASHES . Method: Apply some coconut oil to a cotton bud or clean mascara wand, then gently smooth from the base of the lashes to the tips. This is best done at night after you’ve taken your make-up off, as mascara doesn’t sit well on top of coconut oil. Dr Dimitrova says: ‘As with your hair, the coconut oil cannot produce more eyelashes than you already have. I’m not convinced we’ll see much of a difference here.’ Results: Dr Dimitrova says: ‘I can’t see any change. Possibly it would help if your eyelashes were very brittle, but yours weren’t in bad condition in the first place.’ Will I Switch? As I’m still not very adept at getting the right amount of oil on the cotton wool pad when I’m using it as make-up remover, a lot of it gets on my lashes anyway, so I might do this accidentally — but I don’t hold out any hope that it will make them lusher or longer. SMOOTH FEET . There was a noticeable in the condition of Anna's feet after using the coconut oil (picture posed by a model) Method: I run a lot so my feet are a mess. I’ve got one black toenail and swollen toe, peeling skin on the end of all my toes and cracking under my heels. My routine for the month will be to melt a bit of coconut oil in my hand and rub it into the foot, especially the dry and cracked area. I’ll then wrap my feet in clingfilm and, ideally, leave the oil on overnight. I’ve been advised not to wear socks, as the oil will sink into them instead of the skin. The routine must be repeated every couple of nights for mild dryness and every night for more severe cracking. Adnan Nazir, of The London Foot Clinic, says: ‘It may well be a good moisturiser and could also improve the peeling skin on your toes. As to whether it helps that black toenail, I’ll be interested to see. ‘Don’t use it between your toes, though, as it could encourage fungal infection.’ Results: Mr Nazir says: ‘I’m really very impressed. There is a marked difference in the quality of skin on your feet, and that damaged toenail — which I would expect to take months to heal — has got a lot better in four weeks. I will definitely be recommending this in future.’ Will I Switch? Definitely. I’m really delighted with my prettier feet. HEALTHY GUMS . Method: The technique is called ‘oil pulling’ and involves swishing a tablespoon of oil around the mouth for around 20 minutes each day before you spit it out. This is said to reduce plaque and bacteria, and so helps to fight gum disease. Cosmetic dentist Dr Mervyn Druian, from The London Centre for Cosmetic Dentistry, says: ‘Like many people, you have mild gum disease which makes your gums red and swollen in places and will make them bleed more easily. ‘Most tooth loss in adults is caused by gum disease, so it’s important to get on top of it. If oil pulling helps, great.’ Results: ‘In your case it hasn’t made any difference, I’m afraid. I’m not against the oil pulling but would advise my patients to use it alongside three-monthly visits to the dental hygienist.’ Will I Switch? No. It made no difference, oil pulling feels cloying and the taste of coconut is overpowering. I’ll go to see my hygienist instead. YOUTHFUL SKIN . Is there any benefit to using coconut oil for more youthful skin or a brighter smile? (picture posed by a model) Method: As the coconut oil gives quite a shiny finish, I used it at night with a tiny top-up in the morning, if needed. Dr Sam Bunting, a Harley Street cosmetic dermatalogist, tells me my skin is prone to redness, flushing and the appearance of broken blood vessels. ‘I’d be very wary of using something as heavy as coconut oil,’ she tells me. ‘It has a high comedogenic rating (tendency to block pores) and for someone with quite reactive skin, I predict it may well cause break-outs and irritation.’ Results: Since using the coconut oil I have been suffering from patches of irritated skin and pimples in the folds between my nose and the corners of my mouth. Dr Bunting says: ‘This is almost certainly caused by the change in your beauty routine. Someone with your fair skin type also needs to use a high SPF every day, and a sunscreen won’t sit well on top of coconut oil.’ Will I Switch? No way. My skin looks red and splotchy. It’s oily on my forehead, dry around my mouth. Where’s my moisturiser? WHITE TEETH . Method: Mix two tablespoons of baking soda with two tablespoons of coconut oil to make a smooth paste. Add a drop or two of peppermint oil to make it taste a bit more like toothpaste. Dr Druian says: ‘Home-made toothpaste doesn’t contain fluoride, which helps to prevent cavities and strengthen your enamel. Bicarbonate of soda is abrasive and can damage enamel.’ He is sceptical that it will have any whitening properties. Results: I ditched this after five days. DIY toothpaste is horrible. Your mouth feels slimy and dirty, your breath doesn’t smell fresh and bicarb of soda feels too abrasive. My teeth are no whiter. Will I Switch? Never.","It's a firm favourite with celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Sadie Frost .

"Stephanie Robesky's quest to find a date was a very public one. Having secured the hottest table in Tokyo - Michelin-starred Noma's exclusive pop-up restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental hotel - she needed a companion. So the 40-year-old mobile tech entrepreneur wrote a blog post, advertising for her man. And now, the food enthusiast from San Francisco has posted some suggestive snaps from her very glamorous evening online - complete with a snap of some beautiful flowers from her Mystery Man. Stephanie Robesky was among the lucky few to get a table at Nobu's Tokyo exclusive pop-up . Robesky (pictured left) says she will not reveal the identity of her date - who bought her a bouquet of flowers . But  despite the attention her quest for romance, or at least some company while enjoying some of the world's best cuisine, has drawn, Ms Robesky has chosen to keep the identity of her companion a secret. On her Instagram page, she teased: 'My date's identity will remain a secret. Sorry, not sorry!' The two Michelin star Copenhagen-based restaurant's five-week stint in the Japanese capital ends on Valentine's Day. Unsurprisingly, when 60,000 scrabbled to get a reservation, Ms Robeksy was inundated with men vying to be her date. Stephanie Robesky (right, pictured with a friend) enjoying a meal out during her trip to Tokyo . After bagging a table at the pop-up version of Denmark's famous Noma restaurant, Stephanie was inundated with offers from men vying to be her date . The social media addict often posts images of the meals she indulges in, such as this one, taken in Tokyo . Writing on her blog, Nerd Girl, she explained: 'Yes, there were 60,000 people who tried to get this reservation and I am lucky enough to have secured one for two. 'And, sadly, I don’t have a dining companion.

Indeed, each sitting at the restaurant has just 44 spaces for diners, meaning seats are at a premium. And it seems even head chef René Redzepi knows how sought-after they are: he gave Ms Robesky's hunt a boost when he tweeted out her appeal from his official Twitter account. But the opportunity is not open to just anyone. Ms Robesky, who lists her likes as travelling, good food, 'nerding out' on gadgets and hanging out with bald cats, among other things, has set out a strict criteria which a potential date must meet. Ms Robesky advertised for a fellow food enthusiast to join her for the meal, which falls on her 39th birthday . Ms Robesky was swamped with men desperate to accompany her to Noma, which is based in Copenhagen (pictured) This is the first time head chef René Redzepi has left his Danish restaurant (pictured) for a residency in another country . Writing on her blog, she stipulated eight must-haves for anyone applying - including being single, living in the Bay Area of San Francisco, and know how to use a knife and fork 'properly'. 'Knowledge of Japanese etiquette a big plus,' she added. The date will also have to be able to cover their own flight and accommodation costs. However, the 38-year-old will pay for dinner and wine pairing for the meal, which is to take place in the last week of January.

But even with the strict rules, and with flights boasting a price tag of somewhere around $1,000, Ms Robesky had so many applications she had to extend the opening date. The lucky winner was selected after she met up with three of the potential dinner dates on January 17. Danish Chef Rene Redzepi, who won the title World's Best Restaurant with Noma two years in a row, has moved to Japan for a five week stint in Tokyo . Foodies across the planet have been raving about Noma for  years - with more than one dubbing it 'the world's best restaurant'. The restaurant, which is based in Copenhagen, serves Nordic food reimagined under the watchful eye of head chef René Redzepi. Noma's website boasts it is 'hoping to rediscover our history and shape our future' through its food. Diners are offered a 20-course menu, including unusual dishes such as beef tartare and ants, radish and yeast and reindeer moss and cep mushrooms. A meal at the two Michelin-starred restaurant costs around about £166, with wine pairing costing an extra £104. But it is worth it, according to the restaurant critics. Writing for the Daily Mail in 2010, Tom Parker Bowles concluded: 'Noma is utterly and gloriously unique. And quite, quite brilliant.' The Tokyo pop-up is the first time Redzepi and his team have ventured outside Denmark. It opened last Friday, and so far reviews trickling out suggest it will be just as successful in the east.","Entrepreneur  Stephanie Robesky bagged a table at exclusive restaurant .

"A British woman was spared further prison time by U.S. court after admitting to a fraud charge. Sandra Dunham, 58, pleaded guilty in December 2014 after she and her husband Paul lost a High Court battle against extradition the previous April. They had to be taken to Northampton General Hospital in May after taking drug overdoses the night before they were supposed to hand themselves in to police and U.S. marshals. The Couple were flown to the U.S. from Heathrow Airport in May after a Senior District Judge  at Westminster Magistrates' Court concluded it was a deliberate attempt to avoid or delay extradition. The couple admitted to conspiring to commit wire fraud in a scheme where they fraudulently requested financial reimbursement from their employer for a number of items. Spared: Sandra Dunham (pictured) was sentenced in Maryland District Court to 30 days of imprisonment with credit for time already served in custody, her UK-based solicitor said . Fraud: Sandra's husband Paul (pictured) faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison after also admitting to money laundering offences . Massive losses: The Dunham's (pictured) fraudulently charged personal expenses to corporate credit card . Those included mortgage payments on time-shares in Barbados, luxury bedding for their home, a dog sofa  and other personal expenses. Mr Dunham, 59, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy and money laundering, to which he also pleaded guilty. The couple's UK-based solicitor, Michael Evans, said: 'Sandra Dunham, as part of a plea agreement with the US prosecutor, has today been sentenced in Maryland District Court to 30 days of imprisonment with credit for time already served in custody. 'In practice Sandra therefore has 18 days of home confinement before she returns to the UK during the third week of February. 'We look forward to her safe return to the UK and await the outcome of the sentencing of Mr Dunham which has been delayed until next Thursday, 5 February.' The solicitor said Mrs Dunham has pleaded at US District Court, Greenbelt, Maryland to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The seven wire fraud counts on the indictment leading to her extradition were dismissed. According to their pleas, the defendants worked for Pace Worldwide, which was located in Maryland and North Carolina at various times. It had a subsidiary in the United Kingdom named Pace Europe Ltd. Deported: The couple (left and right) were flown to the U.S. from Heathrow Airport in May, having lost a High Court battle in the UK against extradition . Attempted suicide: They were taken to Northampton General Hospital (pictured) after taking drug overdoses the night before they were due to hand themselves in to police and in turn to U.S. marshals . Extradited:Senior District Judge Howard Riddle at Westminster Magistrates' Court concluded the couple (pictured) had deliberately taken an overdose to avoid or delay extradition . Pace produced parts used to repair and rework electronics for the military. Mr Dunham held a number of executive positions in the company which included president and chief operating officer. Mrs Dunham was initially hired to work for the European subsidiary in the accounts department before eventually becoming Pace Worldwide's director of sales and marketing. The Dunhams were provided with corporate credit cards when they moved from the UK to Maryland and then North Carolina. Between 2002 and 2009, they fraudulently charged personal expenses to their corporate credit cards. They then submitted reimbursement vouchers to Pace which falsely described the expenditures as business expenses, the statement said. As a result of the lengthy scheme, one million dollars (£635,500) in actual losses were incurred.

"A bill that would levy tough new sanctions on Iran if it fails to sign an agreement to curb its nuclear program cleared a Senate committee on Thursday. But lawmakers are holding off on a full Senate vote to see whether diplomatic negotiations yield a deal by March 24. Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee voted 18-4 to pass legislation aimed at ramping up economic pressure on Iran starting in July if it doesn't ink an international deal preventing it from having the capability to develop a nuclear weapon. Republicans can still move ahead with the measure, but they wouldn't have enough votes to override President Barack Obama, who says he'd veto the legislation because it would derail the diplomatic effort to reach a deal, without Democratic support. Sen. Robert Menendez, pictured here at a Tuesday hearing on Capitol Hill, is the co-author of a bill that passed the Senate Banking Committee today and would levy tough new sanctions on Iran if it fails to sign an agreement to curb its nuclear program. Lawmakers are holding off on a full Senate vote to see whether diplomatic negotiations yield a deal by March 24 . The U.S. and other nations negotiating with Tehran have long suspected Iran's nuclear program is secretly aimed at atomic weapons capability. Tehran insists the program is entirely devoted to civilian purposes. Talks with Iran have been extended until July, with the goal of reaching a framework for a deal by the end of March. The country's state-run IRNA news service said Wednesday that Iranian lawmakers have proposed a bill that would scuttle the diplomatic effort if the U.S. imposed new sanctions. A movement to levy more sanctions to cripple the Iranian economy had been moving fast on Capitol Hill. But on Tuesday, Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat who co-authored the measure with Republican Sen. Mark Kirk, and nine other Democrats told Obama in a letter that they wouldn't push the bill until the end of March. 'While I will move to vote today in support of the underlying legislation, I have no intention of moving forward and supporting it on the floor if it is brought before the March 24 deadline' when lawmakers will be able to ascertain 'whether or not an agreement is possible and what that agreement would look like,' Menendez said. The bill would not impose any new sanctions during the remaining timeline for negotiations. It says that if there is no deal by July 6, the sanctions that were eased during negotiations would be reinstated. After that, sanctions would be stepped up every month. 'I have been working on this legislation for quite some number of years to thread the ultimate needle to make sure that we achieve the noble cause of making sure we avoid a nuclear war in the Persian Gulf and make sure that our kids never, ever have to witness such an event,' Kirk said. 'I would say that for those that think that we're rushing too fast ... we're probably acting way too late,' the Illinois legislator said. The committee voted to amend the bill today to include a statement that Israel, an archenemy of Iran, has a right to defend itself. Other amendments to the bill that passed allow Congress to have oversight on any deal approved with Iran; beef up reporting requirements for verifying that Iran is complying with any agreement reached and task the Treasury Department to report on the economic impact of sanctions relief on Iran. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today that Obama would veto legislation - like the bill that was passed today - that gives Congress final say on approving any deal with Iran because it would 'set a harmful precedent' for future negotiations . The White House has been lobbying lawmakers to refrain from throwing more sanctions at Iran amid the delicate negotiations. Asked whether the U.S. would agree to extend the talks if a framework for a comprehensive agreement is not reached by March 24, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, 'We'll see.' Earnest also told reporters Obama would veto legislation that would give Congress final say on approving any deal with Iran because it would 'set a harmful precedent' for future negotiations. Last week, House Speaker John Boehner fueled the rising friction between Capitol Hill and the White House by announcing that he had invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress on March 3 and push for new sanctions. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House Democrats, said Boehner's invitation was 'inappropriate.' Obama said in an interview this week that he wouldn't have a face-to-face meeting with Netanyahu during the visit because it would be 'inappropriate' with elections in Israel just around the corner. Democratic Reps. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Steve Cohen of Tennessee and Maxine Waters of California are circulating a letter asking Boehner to postpone Netanyahu's address to Congress. 'The timing of this invitation and lack of coordination with the White House indicate that this is not an ordinary diplomatic visit,' the letter states.  'Rather, this appears to be an attempt to promote new sanctions legislation against Iran that could undermine critical negotiations.'","Lawmakers are holding off on a full Senate vote - for now - so that they can see whether diplomatic negotiations yield an agreement by March 24 .

"Kevin Howlett, 40, admitted a breach of the Computer Misuse Act at Peterlee Magistrates Court . A married man sent naked 'revenge porn' photos of his mistress to all her friends and family after he discovered she was cheating on him, a court heard. Kevin Howlett learned that his lover had been unfaithful from his own wife after he confessed to the  affair. The betrayed 40-year-old then went through the mobile phone he had loaned to his mistress and sent naked images to her to friends, family and work colleagues. The father-of-two was hauled before magistrates accused of hacking her contacts list and admitted a breach of the Computer Misuse Act. The victim had moved to Darlington, County Durham, from her home in Nottingham after meeting Howlett on Facebook. Peterlee Magistrates Court in Durham heard that she initially lived in a shared house before moving in with her lover and his family. During the affair the victim allowed Howlett to take naked pictures of her. Things turned sour between the pair when Howlett told his wife that he had been having an affair with the woman. It was during the confession that his wife revealed that the victim had been having a series of affairs behind his back. 'Following an incident the relationship between them ended and she packed her belongings, jumped on bus and returned home,' said Paula Sanderson, prosecuting. 'She thought she wouldn't put it past the defendant to send photographs that displayed her naked to her family and friends - and that is effectively what has happened. 'She said that she felt mortified that they, as well as work colleagues, had seen the photographs of her.' Clive Booth, defending, told the court it was an 'unusual offence with a strange background.' He said: 'He felt he had been betrayed and in order to get his revenge he went into the phone and he found her contacts (on a SIM card the victim had left in the phone). 'I don't believe there is anything prohibiting someone sending naked photos on their own phone. Kevin Howlett, 40, is set to return to Peterlee Magistrates Court, pictured above, for sentence next month . 'The reason the defendant was advised to plead guilty was that, on the phone he had lent her and which she had given back to him, he went into her phone contacts without her authority. 'By doing so, in my view, he breached the section in the Computer Misuse Act.' Mr Booth added that Howlett was 'very ashamed' of his actions. Howlett of Darlington, Durham, pleaded guilty to breaching the Computer Misuse Act. The case was adjourned until February 18 for sentencing.","Married Kevin Howlett, 40, admitted a breach of the Computer Misuse Act .

"A trip to Denny's turned into a nightmare for two Wisconsin parents after their three-year-old son stepped onto an unsecured manhole cover and fell into a grease pit. Wyatt Scharenbroch was on the sidewalk next to the restaurant when he asked them if he could jump on a green manhole cover nearby. After his mother Alana told him not to, as it looked wet and slippery, Wyatt angrily stomped his foot down on the lid, which suddenly flew up in the air. The startled boy then lost his balance and fell into the four-foot wide pit. Three-year-old Wyatt (pictured) was completely submerged in a four-foot deep grease pit after stepping onto an unsecured manhole cover  outside a Denny's restaurant in Wisconsin . 'It was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life,' she told the Appleton Post Crescent. Mrs Scharenbroch said she immediately reached inside to try and grab hold of her son when she was hit by a stench that 'smelled like sewage' and a darkness that made it impossible to tell just how deep the hole was. 'I didn't know if it was a contained tube,' she said. 'I thought he was going to get flushed to the lake or sewer forever.' But the child's father, Dan Scharenbroch, was able to pull Wyatt out after grabbing hold of the hood of his jacket. The boy's father, Dan Scharenbroch, was able to pull him out from the grease pit (pictured) after grabbing onto the hood of his jacket. Diners inside the restaurant helped wiped the boy down and offered him clothes . The parents brought their son inside the Grand Chute Denny's, where Mrs Scharenbroch said nearby diners helped wipe the boy down and offered their own water bottles, diaper bags and clean clothes. Wyatt was then taken by ambulance to St Elizabeth Hospital in Appleton for treatment, where he was held for monitoring because he had swallowed some  waste while stuck inside the pit. Mrs Scharenbroch said her son has recovered physically after receiving some scrapes and cuts from the fall but is now 'extremely cautious and very clingy,' which she said is unusual for Wyatt. The boy was monitored at a nearby hospital after swallowing waste inside the pit and was treated for scrapes and cuts from the fall (file photo) Assistant Fire Chief Michael DeBruler said the covers should have been secured and the biggest risk of such an incident would have been the possibility of drowning. 'Fortunately the parents were right there and able to pull the boy to safety,' he said. 'They had him out prior to our arrival.' Mr DeBruler said most restaurants use 'a third-party company' to pump out the grease pits on a regular basis and that it was 'unclear' if it was the company or the restaurant's responsibility to inspect whether the manhole covers are secured. The grease pit is emptied every four to six weeks, according to Madison-based Denny's area manager Mark Enders. Firefighters who responded to the incident worked with Denny's after the boy was rescued to secure the covers. Mr Enders said the restaurant is investigating why the covers weren't secured and is working with the vendor that services the grease pit to make sure the incident doesn't happen again. Wyatt tripped into a container similar to this one and suffered scrapes and cuts from the fall. His mother Alana said the trauma from the fall has made him 'extremely cautious' Firefighters who responded to the incident secured the covers (pictured) after the boy was rescued and an area manager for Denny's said they were investigating why the covers hadn't been screwed on .","Wyatt, from Wisconsin, was completely submerged in the 4ft deep pit .

"The silent half of illusionists Penn & Teller has revealed the truth behind his wordless stage presence. Teller, 66, who legally dropped his first name years ago, explained this week that by not speaking at all on stage and communicating with a series of shrugs and gestures, he creates a greater intimacy with his audience. He was a high school Latin teacher in New Jersey and part-time magician when he met Penn Jillette, a clown college graduate, in the mid-1970s. Scroll down for video . Teller, 66, who dropped his first name years ago, revealed in an interview aired last Sunday that he stays silent during his magic tricks (right) to create a greater intimacy with his audience . Their act turns on contrasting stage personas - Penn is large, loud and brash while Teller is shorter and maintains a mime-like presence throughout the tricks. In an interview aired on Sunday, Teller told CBS: 'Not speaking is just about the most intimate thing you can do. 'If we just stop and look, that gets intimate fast. That's what I feel when I'm on stage.' Penn & Teller have been the headline act at The Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for the past 14 years. The magic duo are also behind TV shows Wizard Wars and Fool Us which encourage up and coming magic talent. In 2013, they were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame in honor of their long career. The unlikely duo admit that their longevity and success is down to the fact that they don't have a 'cuddly friendship'. Penn said: 'We were carny trash... we would take any gig we could get. But all of our confrontations happened in the first couple of years.' Teller added: 'Opposites do sometimes compliment.' Penn & Teller, pictured on stage during 58th Annual Creative Arts Emmy Awards, performing one of their more famous tricks, sawing a person in half . Magic pays! Teller's stunning home sits high in the hills surrounding Las Vegas, where his magic act has been in resident for the past 14 years . The 66-year-old gave CBS a tour of his home which is full of magic artefacts and books and even contains a secret passage hidden behind the library shelves . The other half of the duo, Penn Gillette, lives with his family in a quirky colorful home on the outskirts of Vegas . Teller was a high school Latin teacher who did magic on the sides (pictured) when he met Penn Jillette in the mid-1970s and formed their act . And it's the simplest illusions that keeps Teller hooked on magic. He explained  one of his most beloved tricks - where a red ball seems to move of its own accord towards and around a hoop - really is just a ball, thread and a hoop, which took years of practice to perfect. 'It's a long bit of juggling with me, a ball and one piece of thread,' he said. 'There's no mechanisms off stage.' Teller explained that being able to draw from his own imagination to entertain is what keeps him returning to the stage after four decades. He said: 'That great line from ''Sunday in the Park with George'' - it makes me tear up - ''Look I made a hat where there never was a hat''. 'That pretty much summarizes anybody who makes something artistic - there was nothing there and now something that was in my head is out there.' In a rare interview, Teller revealed one of his favorite tricks with a red ball and a hoop was one of the most simplest - with no mechanics and years of juggling practice .

"House prices are rising at their slowest rate since 2013 - as Britain's property boom finally showed signs of coming to an end. Properties are exchanging hands for 6.8 per cent more this month than a year ago, the lowest pace since November 2013 according to Nationwide. House prices are now 2.4 per cent higher than before the 2008 economic crash - with the average home worth £188,446. Properties are exchanging hands for 6.8 per cent more this month than a year ago, the lowest pace since November 2013 according to Nationwide . Separate Land Registry figures said prices in England and Wales in the year to December rose 7 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in November and the fourth month in a row that the annual rate has fallen. Both sets of figures show that average house prices have remained static since last summer. The Nationwide said the reasons for the slowdown in the housing market since then 'remain unclear', as the economic background has in fact continued to improve. But it predicted that house prices would take off again once people started to feel the benfit of pay rises. Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said the number of mortgages approved  had been about 20 per cent below last year - and surveyors continued to report subdued levels of new buyer enquiries. But Mr Gardner said the reasons for the continued slowdown were unclear given the fall in unemployment, wages that have started to rise faster than inflation and high levels of consumer confidence which have helped fuel strong retail sales growth. 'If the economic backdrop continues to improve as we and most forecasters expect, activity in the housing market is likely to regain momentum in the months ahead,' he said. Britain's five year house price boom has benefited Conservative supporting areas much more than Labour constituencies . Prices were also likely to be supported by the long-term shortage of new houses coming onto the market. 'It is encouraging that the number of new homes built in England was up 8 percent in the year to the third quarter of 2014. However, this is still 34 percent below pre-crisis levels and little over half the expected rate of household formation in the years ahead,' Gardner said. The Land Registry data showed that London house prices ended the year up by 16.3 per cent, at an average of £464,936. In nine boroughs prices were up by more than a fifth over the year, and in every part of the capital rises were in double digits. The biggest leap in prices was in the north-east borough of Waltham Forest, which includes Walthamstow, which saw prices increase by 25.1 per cent to an average of £368,000. Kensington & Chelsea recorded the lowest level of growth within London, at 11.5 per cent over the year, but the average price was still a lofty £1.3million.","Properties exchanging hands for 6.8% more this month than a year ago .

The 22-year-old said: 'He did a bit of dealing to earn some money but was about to give that up and find a proper job.' Cafe owner Fariol Camacho Olivo, 45, said: 'The boy came in and complained of feeling sick after being made to eat the crack. 'He then phoned his brother and told him what had happened.' He added: 'I didn't really believe him but he did look a bit peaky so I gave him a glass of milk telling him it would reduce the effect of the drug.

"An Iranian website linked to the country's Revolutionary Guard has suggested assassinating the children of Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu in revenge for the deaths of key Hezbollah leaders and an Iranian general. Mashregh News ran pictures of both Yair and Avner Netanyahu with their father and mother, Sara, depicting them in sniper's crosshairs and included what they described as a 'detailed intelligence plan' of their movements. It comes after an Israeli airstrike on Hezbollah fighters inside neighbouring Syria earlier this month, which killed six Hezbollah fighters and an Iranian general. Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu, pictured, whose sons have been threatened on an Iranian website . The information and pictures were originally published by the Fars News Agency, according to the Washington Free Beacon under the title 'The file of the Zionist Children'. The article on the Farsi site said that the pair were acceptable targets for assassination due to their links to top Israeli leaders. It also describes them as 'excellences of Zionism' and ends the article in red letters with the words: 'We must await the hunt of Hezbollah.' As well as details about Mr Netanyahu's children, the article also included the details of the sons of former prime ministers Ehud Olmert and Ariel Sharon. However, it has been pointed out much of the information was already available on sites such as Wikipedia. Experts say these type of threats are designed to intimidate the Israelis and act as a deterrent against possible further military action. The threat comes as Mr Netanyahu said today that Iran is to blame for a deadly flare-up along the Israeli-Lebanese border in the deadliest escalation in the disputed zone since the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. The children of former prime ministers Ehud Olmert, left, and Ariel Sharon, right, were also threatened in the article . The violence erupted when the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military convoy in the disputed area, killing two soldiers and wounding seven. Israel responded to the missiles with shelling and a Spanish peacekeeper with the UN force in southern Lebanon was also killed. The area was calm but tense on Thursday and village life appeared to return to normal. But Israeli forces were on high alert and the Lebanese National News Agency said Israeli warplanes were flying low over border villages. Mr Netanyahu said: 'It is Iran that is responsible for yesterday's attack against us from Lebanon.

"The lesbian ex-partner of a multi-millionaire property developer has launched a court battle seeking a larger share of her lover's fortune - even through the wealthy tycoon died more than a year ago. Businesswoman Carol Ainscow told her civil partner Helen Roocroft that her fortune had been reduced to £750,000 at the time their relationship fell apart. But after Ms Ainscow died of a brain tumour in 2013, Ms Roocroft discovered that she was apparently worth around £6million thanks to her investment in Manchester's gay village. Ms Roocroft, 40, now claims she was misled by her ex during their break-up, and says she is entitled to a payout much bigger than the £162,000 she accepted as part of a settlement. Battle: Helen Roocroft, left, claims she was misled over the wealth of her ex-partner Carol Ainscow, right, who died in 2013 . The case which reached the Court of Appeal this week is unique - not only is it believed to be the first lesbian 'divorce' ever to be heard in the court, it is the first time a dead person has been retrospectively accused of hiding assets. The two women, both from Bolton, were together for 19 years after starting a relationship in the early 1990s, the court was told. During this time Ms Ainscow became a leading property developer in Manchester's Canal Street district, as well as opening a bar in Soho, central London. She built a massive fortune through her business empire, and was named on the Sunday Times rich list for the North with an estimated value of £30million, the court heard. Ms Ainscow and Ms Roocroft entered into a civil partnership in 2008, but they separated the next year and their legal partnership was dissolved in August 2010. Court battle: Ms Roocroft has taken the case to the Court of Appeal in a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice . Ms Roocroft applied for financial maintenance after the break-up, and was told that Ms Ainscow's business had been seriously affected by the recession, leaving her with just £750,000 in assets. Seeking a 'clean break', Ms Roocroft accepted a settlement of £162,000, to be paid in instalments. When Ms Ainscow died of a brain tumour in September 2013 at the age of 55, her ex-partner realised that she was in fact much wealthier than previously thought, the court was told. Business accounts for the year ending 2010 showed that Artisan Holdings, a property company wholly owned by Ms Ainscow, had a net worth of £5.5million. Ms Roocroft's lawyer Samantha Hillas said: 'If Ms Ainscow had made full disclosure, it is inconceivable that the court would have approved an award in such modest terms to a wife in such modest circumstances.' Wealth: Ms Ainscow helped to develop Manchester's gay village centred around Canal Street, pictured . Last year, a county court judge denied Ms Roocroft permission to re-open her claim against Ms Ainscow's estate, but that decision was overturned by Lady Justice Black. 'There was material to support the case that there was non-disclosure of potential significance to an ancillary relief claim,' said the judge. 'It was Ms Ainscow's duty to make full and fair disclosure, not only so Ms Roocroft could evaluate her claim and decide upon how to proceed with it, but also so the court could exercise its discretion. 'Ms Ainscow had denied that Ms Roocroft's understanding of her financial position was correct. The judge must have proceeded on the basis that she had much more modest means than Ms Roocroft thought.' She added: 'It is surely arguable that there is a public interest in not supporting those who mislead others, in particular the court. I am persuaded that the grounds of appeal, as drafted, have a real prospect of success.' Pointing to the case's unusual circumstance, Lady Justice Black said: 'The complication of the death of Ms Ainscow is significant. I'm not aware of any similar case where the non-disclosure has been acted upon following death of the other party.' Ms Hillas said Miss Roocroft's appeal was likely to be 'bitterly contested' by the representatives of Ms Ainscow's estate, which was inherited by her mother because she died without making a will.","Property tycoon Carol Ainscow was in a relationship with Helen Roocroft  for 19 years before they dissolved civil partnership in 2010 .

"An incredibly rare Sierra Nevada red fox has been spotted has inside Yosemite National Park for the first time in a century. Park officials confirmed the sighting in California of one of the rarest mammals in North America, with only 50 in existence. It was captured on one of the park's hi-tech motion sensor cameras. The rare Sierra Nevada red fox, which was spotted inside Yosemite National Park. It is the first time in a century one of the creatures has been spotted inside the park . The Sierra Nevada red fox is a solitary creature and rarely travels in groups. It's also a nocturnal animal, meaning that sighting of the fox are incredibly rare. Superintendent of Yosemite National Park Don Neubacher said: 'We are thrilled to hear about the sighting of the Sierra Nevada red fox, one of the most rare and elusive animals in the Sierra Nevada. 'National parks like Yosemite provide habitat for all wildlife and it is encouraging to see that the red fox was sighted in the park.' Sarah Stock, a wildlife biologist at the park added: 'Confirmation of the Sierra Nevada red fox in Yosemite National Park’s vast alpine wilderness provides an opportunity to join research partners in helping to protect this imperiled animal. 'We’re excited to work across our boundary to join efforts with other researchers that will ultimately give these foxes the best chances for recovery.' In 2010, a red fox was also spotted to the north of Yosemite National Park, where it is believed there is a small fox population . There were two documented sightings of the animals in early December at Sonara Pass, which lies to the north of the park. Biologists believe there is a small fox population in that area. Prior to that, the last verified sighting of the animal was over 20 years ago. It is almost 100 years since one was seen in Yosemite. Park officials say they will continue to try and track the Sierra Nevada red fox using remote cameras in the hope that they will find more animals. Biologists say Yosemite's vast alpine wilderness, pictured, provides the perfect habitat for the Sierra Nevada red fox . At each camera station, the crew also set up hair snare stations in the hopes of obtaining hair samples for genetic analysis. Through genetic analysis, park workers can learn more about the diversity within the population and to confirm whether the animal detected in Yosemite is genetically related to those in the Sonora Pass area .","Sierra Nevada red fox detected on park motion-sensor cameras .

"A woman has revealed how she visited her dying father in jail to tell him 'I love you' after he was jailed for decades of horrifying abuse in which he treated her as his 'dutiful wife'. Judy van Niekerk, 46, from London, was just six when her father Noah Walsh began abusing her, keeping her imprisoned in the family home. For years he beat her, shot her in the chest and forced her to undergo an agonising home abortion using a coat hanger. Judy van Niekerk pictured as a child with her father Noah Walsh, who began abusing her when she was six . Judy visited her father in 2004, days before he died of cancer. She felt 'love and compassion' for her abuser . Judy cooked and cleaned for her father  after her mother left the family when she was just six. For years he subjected her to years of physical and sexual abuse, breaking her bones and even shooting her in the chest. Finally the survivor, who now teaches others to overcome difficulty, fled to London and finally South Africa where meeting her husband gave her the strength to bring her father to justice. Even though the abuse started when she was very young, looking back at her early childhood, Judy  has mixed memories. 'Most people have happy childhood memories. Mine include my dad teaching me to swim and taking me for picnics. 'But I have a lot of bad ones memories too. 'When I was six and my dad taught me to box. I was only little but he expected me to fight him, even though it hurt me.; . Inspirational survivor Judy van Niekerk has found peace and now helps others achieve their dreams . She wasn't his only victim. 'He was mean to my mum and called her useless and lazy and hit her,' said Judy. When she was six her mother left. She later returned, only to flee again when Judy was ten, leaving her at her father's mercy. 'Each time she left he treated me like his dutiful wife,' she said. Noah forced Judy to share his bed from the age of 11. 'I should have been going to school. But he didn't let me. He said, ""you have too much to do here"". 'I had to stay home and look after my five kid siblings. I had to get up early to make breakfast for everyone, and pack their lunchboxes. 'I was made to wash our clothes by hand, as we didn't have a machine. Walsh won custody of his daughter in 1979 when she was 12 or 13 and he continued to bully her. 'He threatened me with knives,' she recalled. 'The back-breaking housework left me feeling exhausted. By the evening I was always ready for bed - but my dad had other ideas. 'He made me stay up with him until he wanted to go bed. He would then demand that I sleep in his room, and would force himself on me. 'I was only a kid when he started to sexually assault and rape me. I was in such pain afterwards. He left me feeling confused and totally worthless. Judy, pictured as a teenager, her smile belies she endured throughout her childhood and beyond . No one else know what Judy was going through. 'My siblings never saw him do this.They didn't know I fell pregnant that year either as, fortunately for dad, I miscarried.' When she was 13 his violence left her with broken bones and he threatened to shoot her. 'He told me I was evil and wasn't worthy of his love,' she said. 'He said he had sacrificed having a life himself, to save me. 'He told me: ""If you don't change I'm going to have to kill you."" 'One day when I was 14, he got angry and shot me in the chest.' A neighbour called an ambulance and doctors told her she could have died but Walsh told them  she had pulled the trigger herself. Yet despite landing in hospital, Judy couldn't rely on anyone to help her escape her living nightmare. She said: 'We kept moving house so we didn't have neighbours looking out for us, or my school. Dad forbade me to go so I didn't have friends to confide in. 'He'd force me to wait for him in his bed for when he got home from work. That same year, I fell pregnant a second time. 'I wanted to keep the baby as I was incredibly lonely locked up all day. I hoped it would give me someone to talk to. 'But dad couldn't risk people knowing what he'd done to me. 'So he punched me in the stomach, made me take scolding hot baths, to try and end the pregnancy. 'Finally he carried out a home abortion using a coat hanger.' Her husband Tiny van Niekerk, who she met in South Africa, finally helped her see the abuse wasn't her fault . Two years later she had another abortion at a clinic. Walsh gave Judy a script to recite to the doctors, declaring that a pretend boyfriend had made her pregnant. She said: 'Later I apologised to dad for getting pregnant. I felt it was my fault. I was brainwashed.' Finally when Judy was 20 she hatched a plan to escape. She contacted employment agencies to secure a job, got a credit card, packed her bags with clothes and a stone from a necklace her dad had bought her. She then escaped during the night, stayed in a B&B and next morning went to the airport to fly to London where she trained as an accountant. 'I had realised if I didn't make a run for it or I might not get another chance,' she said. Yet even being in London was too close to her father so Judy moved to South Africa where she met Tiny van Niekerk, 46, who she later married. He made her finally realise that she wasn't to blame for how her father had treated her. Thanks to his support and encouragement she finally worked up the courage to face her father in court. In October 2000, Walsh, then 55, appeared at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin. Out of 30 charges, Walsh admitted to three charges of rape and two of indecent exposure. Judy was face to face with her father for the first time in more than a decade. 'There wasn't a screen in the court room, and I looked straight at dad as I gave evidence,' said Mrs van Niekerk. With Tiny's support (left, with Judy), Judy had the courage to return to face her father and bring him to justice . 'In a statement read out to the court, my dad had described our relationship as special. He'd said, ""we lived as husband and wife, so when my daughter left, my world fell apart"".' But Justice Carney described the crimes 'as one of the worst cases of this nature he had ever heard.' Walsh, of Sandymount, County Monaghan, was jailed for 15 years. Just four years into his sentence, in 2004 Mrs van Niekerk received a message from police saying her father was in a hospice with terminal lung cancer. So she decided to see him. 'I realised I had to tell him I cared,' she said. 'I was grateful for everything he'd taught me - how to swim, and be strong. I was scared at first but the fear soon melted away as I set eyes on dad who was ravaged by cancer and frail.' Yet Walsh had no idea of the pain and misery he'd inflicted on his daughter. She continued: 'I hated seeing him suffer and he was pleased to see me. 'He was confused about why I'd reported him to police though. But it didn't upset me, or make me angry. I couldn't judge him. 'I told him, ""I love you"" and he said it back. 'After he died I was sad. He was still my dad. I was pleased I'd got to see him one last time. 'I had complete love and compassion for him. 'But finally I was at peace.'","Judy van Niekerk, 46, from London, was six when the abuse began .

"A truck packed with thousands of live cats destined for the dinner table in Vietnam has been stopped by police. Cat meat- known locally as 'little tiger'- is an increasingly popular delicacy in the Southeast Asian country. While officially banned, it can still be found in specialist restaurants. The three tons of cats, which were crammed into bamboo cages stacked on top of each other, were seized in the capital of Hanoi on Tuesday but  their lives are still in the balance as police decide whether or not they should be destroyed. Thousands of live cats destined for consumption were discovered packed into a truck in bamboo boxes in Vietnam's capital of Hanoi . The truck driver admitted the animals had been smuggled over the border from China into the northeastern Quang Ninh province where he bought them. He told police the cats were destined 'for consumption' in the capital. It is not known if they were destined to be sold to restaurants or individuals. An officer from Dong Da district police station said that according to Vietnamese laws on smuggled goods, all the cats would have to be destroyed. 'But we have not made up our mind what to do with them' because of the large volume of animals, the policeman added. Police have seized the cages of live cats (pictured) which had been smuggled in from China . Cat meat, known locally as 'little tiger', is an increasingly popular delicacy in Vietnam, although its consumption is officially banned to encourage their ownership . Photos which have been posted on social media, reveal the awful conditions for the smuggled cats which were packed into dozens of bamboo crates, stacked on top of one another. Vietnam has long banned the consumption of cat meat in an effort to encourage their ownership and keep the country's rat population under control. But there are still dozens of restaurants serving cat in Hanoi and it is rare to see felines roaming the streets - most pet-owners keep them indoors or tied up in fear of thieves. Such is the demand from restaurants that cats are sometimes smuggled across the border from China, Thailand and Laos where it is not widely eaten. The rescued cats have had a temporary reprieve for the girlsy fate but their lives still hang in the balance as officers said they had not made up their minds what to do with them .","The truck of live cats bound for the dinner table was stopped in Hanoi .

"She plans to celebrate her 60th birthday on Saturday with lavish Caribbean bash, with even her tennis coach and yoga teacher making it onto the coveted guest list. Just don’t expect Carole Middleton’s only sibling, Gary Goldsmith, to be among those raising a toast to her good health on Mustique, one of the most exclusive islands in the Caribbean. The Duchess of Cambridge’s shamed ‘Uncle G’, whose colourful lifestyle - including his self-confessed drugs use - has proved an embarrassment in recent years, is one of a number of Middleton family members who haven’t been invited to celebrate Carole’s big day. Big day: The Duchess of Cambridge's mother Carole (pictured together above) is preparing to celebrate her 60th birthday with a lavish party in the Caribbean, and even her tennis coach and yoga teacher will be there . Lavish: Mrs Middleton has planned an intimate gathering for 30 hand-picked guests at Villa Rocina in Mustique . While sources insist that Gary is ‘supremely chilled’ about the situation and wishes his sister well, locals on the island are agog at the apparent snub. ‘We don’t know why Gary has not been invited, particularly as he is her only sibling. You can only speculate really,’ said one source close to the family yesterday. ‘There’s not going to be any kind of party back at home either as we understand, so this really is the official birthday bash. It seems a shame that her closest relative won’t be there.’ It is understood that neither Pippa Middleton’s boyfriend, Nico Jackson, or Donna Air, currently dating Kate’s brother James, will be present at the weekend’s festivities either – although, naturally, Prince William will be. ‘It’s just a question of protocol really. It's a bit of a family lockdown as it always is when William and Kate are involved,’ said one well-placed source. Instead the royal mother-in-law will celebrate with her husband and children – as well as the crème de la crème of Caribbean society. The intimate gathering for 30 hand-picked guests reflects how far the fortunes of former air hostess Carole - and her genial husband Michael - have transformed over the last decade. The middle-class family from Berkshire have become millionaires through their firm selling party goods on the internet. Now they rub shoulders every winter on Mustique - made famous by the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, who used to own a villa there - with some of the richest (and most privileged) people in the world. Carole, the Mail understands, will be holding her birthday soiree at Villa Rocina, the exquisite sea-view property they have taken over for their annual winter holiday this year. The Oliver-Messel designed home, which boasts a 30 foot pool, gym and access to a private beach, is loved by the whole family, including Prince William and Kate, who flew out last week with their 18-month-old son, Prince George. Confirmed names on the guest list, however, include many from the upper echelons of Mustique society such as Dr Mark Cecil and his wife Katie, both of whom were guests at William and Kate’s wedding. The Old Harrovian hedge fund millionaire is, ironically, Nico Jackson’s boss, and has leant his own Mustique villa, Aurora, to the Cambridges before. His food and interiors stylist wife Katie was a collaborator on Pippa's much-maligned first tome, Celebrate. A source said: ‘Dr Mark has become a very good friend of the Middletons. It’s very incestuous like that on the island.’ Indeed, other guests include Jeanette Cadet from the Villa Rentals company on Mustique and Liz Saint from its Equestrian Centre, where Carole, in particular, is a keen rider. Then there is Mustique’s resident doctor, Dr Michael Bunby, and his fashion designer wife Lotty ‘B’ (her clients include Jerry Hall and Liz Hurley), who have also become great friends of the Middletons and have been known to revel in the connection over dinner. Another guest is Roger Pritchard, who is the managing director of The Mustique Company, and one of his predecessors, the Hon Brian Alexander, heir to the Earldom of Tunis. The source said: ‘The Mustique Company is basically a small group of elite individuals who run the island. If you don't know them and they don't know you, you don't get to holiday there.’ Serene: The exquisite sea-view property has been taken over by the Middleton family for their winter holiday . Resident tennis pro, Richard Schaffer, has also secured an invite - all of the Middletons have a fearsome backhand - as well as yoga teacher Greg Allen (even William has been known to try one of his sun salutations). And no party on Mustique would be complete without the greying but legendary Basil Charles, the owner of Basil’s Bar, who knew Princess Margaret and is apparently making ‘a bespoke champagne cocktail’ for Carole. Lovable Irish rogue Brian Kinsella, the witty bar manager from the Middleton’s favourite London hotel, The Goring, is due to fly out this week to assist with drinks on the night. He has created a special ‘mocktail’ for the non-drinkers present – which will no doubt include six-month-pregnant Kate – as well as offering Carole a cool glass of her favourite imported Chablis. ‘Apparently he’s concocted something heavenly, which he is calling Mother's Mocktail, from maple spice, passion fruit syrup, pineapple and ice,’ the source revealed. ‘The Middletons stayed at The Goring for the royal wedding it’s where they have many trusted friends. ‘But it's interesting that Carole has invited a staff member from the hotel when she hasn’t even invited her own brother.' The five star hotel’s manager, Jeremy Goring, will also be on hand to cast his eagle eye over the proceedings, which includes a four-course dinner cooked by an in-house chef. According to locals, the large tropical garden at Villa Rocina will be lit by torches for added atmosphere. ‘A lot of thought has been given by Carole into decorating the villa and garden for the night. It's going to be stunning,’ said one. Absent: There will be several absences on the guest list for Saturday’s bash including Ms Middleton's brother Gary Goldsmith (right), Pippa's boyfriend Nico Jackson and son James's girlfriend Donna Air (together left) Entertainment will be provided by a jazz band featuring singer Dana Gillespie, who is on the island to perform at Mustique’s annual Blues festival. And sources say Carole has asked that instead of presents, each guest plant a sapling tree. The source said: ‘There will be a short ceremony where the saplings get planted at the nearby Villa Aurora, owned by Mark Cecil. There is an amazing arboretum there. ‘The Middletons used to have a tree at the Villa Aurora but it died, so Carole thought it would be a lovely idea to have every invited guest planting a sapling on her birthday. She likes the continuity.’ Guests have been asked to leave their camera phones at home, as William and Kate will be present. ‘That’s one of the reasons that they are holding the party in a private villa rather than at Basil's bar. They do not want pictures coming out,’ the source said. ‘That said, it is extremely unlikely that anyone there would want to take one. It’s just not the done thing here.’ The source added: ‘The guest list alone shows how much the Middletons have made this island their own and the party is as much a thank you to the locals as a birthday celebration. No expense has been spared. ‘We find it interesting that Mustique is where the Middletons – including Kate and William - are now making their second home, just like Princess Margaret did. ‘It’s clearly the only place in the world they feel comfortable enough to completely relax.’","Carole Middleton set to celebrate her 60th birthday on Caribbean island .

"It's the afternoon after surgery and Big Brother's Skye Wheatley is writhing in agony in her hospital bed. The pretty blonde from the Gold Coast is unusually quiet after undergoing a boob job at Bangkok's Piyavate Hospital to increase her asymmetrical 10A and 10C chest to matching Ds. Propped up against a mountain of pillows, drains attached to her bandaged chest, she calls for the nurse demanding more pain killers before glancing down at her chest and declaring: 'Hello my lovely Bangkok babies!' Dream come true: Big Brother's Skye Wheatley is recovering after undergoing a boob job at Bangkok's Piyavate Hospital to increase her asymmetrical 10A and 10C chest to matching Ds . The reality TV star is among 15,000 Australians who fly to Thailand every year in pursuit of affordable cosmetic surgery. But some Australian medical experts have growing concerns over the commercialisation of cosmetic surgery, especially patients who travel abroad to go under the knife. Ta da! Skye admires the work of her Bangkok doctor post surgery . The 20-year-old barista from Labrador has long wanted to correct and enhance her wonky cleavage, insisting boyfriends called her 'pancake' because of her flat chest. Fed up with feeling deflated, she signed up to a 10-day tour with Australian-wide medical tourism agency, Medi Makeovers, lured by the promise of cut price surgery. Instead of forking out up to $12,000-$15,000 for a breast augmentation Down Under, patients can get breast implants and other procedure  often for a third of the price at $3,800 with highly qualified plastic surgeons. Skye, however, didn't anticipate the pain of undergoing three-hour surgery, which she describes as 'the worst I have ever felt.' Holding her chest tightly, mascara tears rolling down her eyes, she added: 'This has to be worse than childbirth, surely?' 'I've ripped my nail off, I've split my head open but this is something else. 'No one who's had a boob job ever tells you about the pain, they just sit on the beach and say ""I love my boobies."" 'I've got Tourette's Syndrome, the pain is so bad I can't stop swearing.' The aftermath of surgery: Skye, however, didn't anticipate the pain of undergoing three-hour surgery, which she describes as 'the worst I have ever felt' Fan favourite: Skye rose to fame after appearing on the 2014 season of Big Brother Australia . Beauty is pain: Propped up against a mountain of pillows, drains attached to her bandaged chest, she calls for the nurse demanding more pain killers before glancing down at her chest and declaring: 'Hello my lovely Bangkok babies!' Waiting for the pain to subside: Fed up of feeling deflated over her smaller breasts, she signed up to a 10-day tour with Australian-wide medical tourism agency, Medi Makeovers, lured by the promise of cut price surgery . There are 15,000 Australians who jet to Thailand every year seeking cheaper cosmetic surgery at the hands of highly qualified surgeons for often a third of the price of the equivalent procedure in Australia. Thailand, which once bore company with dodgy back street surgeons and unsafe practises, is today the hub of a booming multi-billion dollar medical tourism industry, which pulled in a staggering $4.31 billion in revenue in 2013. Dr Tim Papadopoulos, the president of the Australasian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, is concerned about the commercialisation of cosmetic surgery and patients who travel abroad to contribute to this lucrative business. He describes the recent hype over medical tourism - cosmetic surgery in particular - as a 'global health bazaar'. A good deal: Instead of forking out up to $12,000-$15,000 for a breast augmentation Down Under, patients can get breast implants and other procedures, often for a third of the price at $3,800 with highly qualified plastic surgeons . Recovering after surgery: The 20-year-old barista from Labrador has long wanted to correct and enhance her wonky cleavage insisting boyfriends called her 'pancake' because of her flat chest . Reality sets in: Holding her chest tightly, mascara tears rolling down her eyes, she added: 'This has to be worse than childbirth, surely?' In pain: Skye found herself in tears following the surgery . But what's most distressing for Dr Papadopoulos is that medical tourism companies are subject to little oversight and not obliged to undergo accreditation. 'Commercialisation of cosmetic surgery and medical tourism threatens our efforts to convince the public that medicine is not a commodity or a trade,' Dr Papadopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'It emphasises positive outcomes and downplays the pain and risks of medical intervention.' And he's seen firsthand the 'good, the bad and the ugly of medical tourism'. 'Most times patients get good results but we do deal with a number of patients who come to us for complications from overseas procedures,' Dr Papadopoulos said. Common complications include: infections, incompletely healed wounds and asymmetrical scars. 'Some of the important risks patients should be aware of is whether they are going to an appropriate institution or facility,' Dr Papadopoulos said. 'They should also know about their doctor, whether they are properly qualified and whether the plastic surgery is board certified.' Post op: Sitting propped up in her hospital bed, the beautiful blonde looked vulnerable . Step-by-step: Daily Mail Australia has followed Skye's plastic surgery journey . On top of the world: The Gold Coast babe talked of her pain following her procedure but is happy with the end result . 'The pain is so bad I can't stop swearing': Overwhelmed by pain following her operation, Skye burst into tears . The cosmetic surgery journey for Skye began when she arrived in Bangkok on Monday night. The following morning she saw reconstructive plastic surgeon doctor Rungkit Tanjapatkul who sized her up suggesting different types of implants to align her breasts - and who advised her to drop her dream of DDs for Ds. That same night she was wheeled into surgery and, recalling the experience the next day, Skye said: 'I was so scared I prayed to God. I told him ""I'm so grateful for everything, except my boobs, God, please look after me on the operating table.""' The reality star, known for her flirtatious antics on the show with fellow contestants Jake Richardson and Ryan 'Leo' Burke, will be discharged from hospital on Thursday at 2pm once her drains and bandages have been removed. Happy on the inside: Despite the tears, Skye is ecstatic about her new 10D breasts . Sizing her up: Reconstructive plastic surgeon doctor Rungkit Tanjapatkul sizes up the Big Brother star's breasts in Bangkok on Tuesday . Considerations: Skye stands in front of a mirror in a white T-shirt to see what will work . She will spend the next week convalescing at the city's five star Grande Centre Point Ploenchit hotel. Skye's stitches will be removed in seven days and she has been advised to wear compression garments for three months. 'I can't wait to see them,' she says, adding, 'They feel nice already, really plump, whoever said fake boobs don't feel good? I'm so excited.' 'Deformed': The former barista from the Gold Coast insists her size 10 assets are asymmetrical . Medi Makeovers is a mother-and-daughter medical travel agency with consultants in Sydney, the Gold Coast, Adelaide and New Zealand. Set up in 2006 by former beauty therapist and salon owner Daniela Pratico, it sends over an average fifty Australians for plastic surgery to Thailand every month. It is billed as Australia's number one medical travel agency, working with the Royal Thai Consulate-General and Thai Government. Clients hail from the UK, USA, Canada, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Guam, Russia, Sweden, China and Japan. Since placing third in Big Brother last year, Skye has been besieged with calls from marketing companies and publicity reps, asking her to endorse products on social media, including everything from bikinis to underwear- offers she feels she can't take full advantage of until after surgery. 'I need to look symmetrical now,' she says. 'It's not about size, it's about choice,' she says, adding, 'Why not if you can? I like the perfect look.' She insists she wants to remain single 'for now', having spent many years in relationships. And she plans to take up professional singing lessons and carve out a career in music, while continuing promotional work for brands. Nerves: Sitting in the waiting room, the reality star is overwhelmed with some level of anxiety . Overseas trip: Skye has travelled abroad for the first time with Australia-wide medical travel agency Medi Makeovers to fix what she calls ‘wonky boobs’ that have made her feel deflated for years . 'You know, I just want to be a reality star forever,' she says. 'This is all about me now,' she adds. 'I need to find out what I want in life and to look good for myself and not worry about having a boyfriend or what a boyfriend wants.' Doctor Rungkit told Daily Mail Australia Thailand is the 'hub' of cosmetic surgery with the bulk of clients coming from Australia. 'Plastic surgery is a growing industry in Thailand, people never stop wanting to look young and better. If anything the numbers of people wanting surgery will only increase.' Revamp: The bubbly blonde says she doesn't want to give young fans the impression she is opting for surgery abroad without due consideration of the risks-  but wants to finally feel comfortable in her own skin .","Big Brother's Skye Wheatley underwent a boob job at Bangkok's  Piyavate Hospital .

She managed to continue working, designing and making dresses for brides-to-be who wanted to use her services. Cheryl said that she had always wanted to be the person to design and make the dress for her own big day as she would never trust another designer.

Cheryl said: 'I worked hard day and night without stopping for weeks before the wedding to make sure everything was right. 'I just hid up in my little sewing room and got stuck in. I had to hand stitch each of the 22,000 goose feathers, which I made sure I got from a UK supplier. 'My final piece in my Art and Design degree was based on Swan Lake and when I graduated and Joel proposed, I've been obsessed with feathers and knew I wanted to have them on my wedding dress. 'I wanted it to be a winter wedding because Joel popped the question on Christmas Day in 2011. The dress had to have a winter theme but I wanted it to be extravagant because it reflects my personality perfectly. 'It is a unique piece. I don't know any other designer around here that works so intricately with feathers. I had to make my own wedding dress, it's always been my dream.'

"A.P.C. founder Jean Touitou has apologized for using 'ignorant and offensive' remarks to introduce the brand's fall 2015 menswear show in Paris this week, after Timberland  terminated its relationship with the brand. During the fashion show, Mr Touitou held up a sign that read, 'Last Ni##@$ IN PARIS,' and explained that A.P.C's collaboration with Timberland is 'a very strong ghetto signifier.' Timberland chose to 'immediately terminate' its involvement with A.P.C., including the footwear collaboration it had planned for this fall. Now, Mr Touitou has said he is 'deeply regretful' for his remarks. Timberland has terminated its relationship with A.P.C. after founder Jean Touitou (pictured) used 'offensive remarks' to introduce the brand's fall 2015 menswear show in Paris this week . 'When describing our brand's latest collaboration, I spoke recklessly using terms that were both ignorant and offensive,' he said in a statement sent to MailOnline. 'I apologize and am deeply regretful for my poor choice of words, which are in no way a reflection of my personal views.' Timberland's president, Stewart Whitney, told Racked that after the company became aware of the 'offensive remarks' made by Mr Touitou, he chose to 'immediately terminate' Timberland's involvement with the A.P.C. brand, including the footwear collaboration we had planned for this fall. 'Simply stated, this kind of language and approach is in complete contrast with our values. Timberland seeks to collaborate with designers and brands who are at the forefront of lifestyle trends; equally important, they must also share our values. 'We will not tolerate offensive language or racial slurs of any kind being associated with the Timberland brand.' According to A.P.C., Mr Touitou didn't mean to offend. In an earlier statement sent to BuzzFeed, the brand stated that Mr Touitou was simply making a reference to two moments in recent popular culture. While holding up a sign that read, 'Last Ni##@$ IN PARIS,' Mr Touitou explained that A.P.C's collaboration with Timberland is 'a very strong ghetto signifier' Yesterday Timberland chose to 'immediately terminate' its involvement A.P.C., including the footwear collaboration it had planned for this fall . 'One being the song Niggas in Paris by Kanye West and Jay Z and the second being the Bernardo Bertolucci film Last Tango in Paris. The connection was used to describe a look for the collection and was in no way intended to cause offense.' Style.com printed Mr Touitou's original remarks, revealing that he called the collection 'Last N****s in Paris' because 'it's the sweet spot when the hood—the 'hood—meets Bertolucci's movie Last Tango in Paris. So that's 'N****s in Paris' and Last N****s in Paris. 'I mean, it's nice to play with the strong signifiers. The Timberland here is a very strong ghetto signifier. In the ghetto, it is all the Timberlands, all the big chain. Not at the same time—never; it's bad taste. 'So we designed Timberlands with Timberland.' Later, Style.com asked Mr Touitou to clarify what he meant. He explained via Email: 'I made looks which are a cross-over of those two references: the Timberland shoes and the sweat pants are iconic of hip-hop, and the camel hair color coat, worn with nothing under it, is iconic of that precise movie. 'I am friends with Kanye [West, who recorded Ni**as in Paris with Jay Z], and he and I presented a joint collection at the same place, one year ago, and that this thing is only a homage to our friendship.'","A.P.C.  founder Jean Touitou has apologized for using 'ignorant and offensive' remarks to introduce the brand's fall 2015 menswear show in Paris last week .

"An innovative new product has emerged from Silicon Valley which fits over your mattress and works to improve your slumber. The Luna mattress cover - which costs between $179 and $229 depending on its size - tracks the user's sleeping patterns using hundreds of tiny sensors to analyse breathing frequency, heart rate, temperature and movement. It learns your regular bed time, then heats your bed to optimum levels, tracks the quality of your shut-eye and wakes you up in the morning during a light sleep phase - making rising easier - by syncing with the Luna app on your phone. Scroll down for video . Worth getting into bed for: The Luna mattress cover - which costs between $179 and $229 depending on its size - tracks the user's sleeping patterns using hundreds of tiny sensors . The Luna, which is machine washable and runs in sizes from Full to California King, can currently be pre-ordered and is scheduled to ship in August. The futuristic mattress cover boasts dual-zone controls, which means its sensors can track you and your partner's side of the bed separately, then adjust temperature levels accordingly. Microphone sensors can even tell whether either of you snored the previous night, and if so, who and how frequently. Couples-friendly: The Luna boasts dual-zone controls, which means its sensors can track you and your partner's side of the bed separately, then adjust temperature levels accordingly . Magic: The cover (pictured) learns your regular bed time, then heats your bed to optimum levels, tracks the quality of your shut-eye and wakes you up in the morning during a light sleep phase . Luna's co-founder, tech entrepreneur Matteo Franceschetti, based in San Francisco, California, developed the mattress cover to solve his own sleep problems. 'Everything around us is getting smarter, except our beds,' he says. Mr Franceschetti estimates that in his seven years as a CEO, he has lost approximately 900 hours of sleep due to his restless legs syndrome. Several sleep disorders, according to WebMD, can be improved by regulating the temperature of your sleeping environment. The symptoms of restless legs syndrome, for example, which is an insomnia-inducing disorder characterized by an impulse to shift the legs around erratically, can be eased with the use of heating sleeping pads. Talk to me: The Luna works with an app (pictured) that provides detailed data about your previous night's sleep and lets you customize its settings . For customers who have 'smart-enabled' gadgets in their homes - such as app-controlled security systems, lights, thermostats and coffee brewers - the Luna can sync with them too. That means that when you get into bed, the Luna will automatically signal your doors to lock, your burglar alarm to activate, your lights to switch off and your central heating to adjust. And when you wake up in the morning, it can tell your coffee machine that you've just stepped out of bed and have your beans brewing for you faster than you can say 'triple espresso'. An Indiegogo campaign to fund the last stages of Luna's production process launched yesterday and hit its $100,000 goal in just six hours. As of today, it has raised more than $340,000.","The Luna mattress cover is woven with hundreds of sensors to track your sleeping patterns .

"Labour's big beasts were last night at war over Ed Miliband’s controversial election campaign tactics. Lord Prescott reacted with fury after two former Cabinet colleagues questioned their leader’s relentless focus on the health service, rather than the economic legacy of New Labour. The former deputy prime minister branded John Hutton and Alan Milburn ‘Tory collaborators’. And Mr Miliband came under further pressure over claims that he said privately he is aiming to ‘weaponise’ the NHS as a campaign tool. Scroll down for video . Head to head: Alan Milburn (right) was condemned by Lord Prescott for attacking Labour's election strategy . Controversy: Lord Hutton and Mr Milburn had questioned Ed Miliband's relentless focus on the health service . Lord Hutton and Mr Milburn, two senior Blairites, yesterday accused the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls of failing to defend the economic record of the last Labour government. ‘They have worked harder to distance themselves from New Labour than to defend its record,’ the two former ministers said in a joint article for the Financial Times. ‘This hands the Tories a needless advantage. If Labour is to win in May, the two Eds need to set the record straight and reclaim ground foolishly bequeathed to their opponents.’ On Tuesday – the day of a big NHS campaign launch by Mr Miliband and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham – Mr Milburn warned Labour was making a fatal mistake if it positioned itself as the party that would put more money into the health service, without saying how it would introduce further reforms. ‘You’ve got a pale imitation actually of the 1992 general election campaign. Maybe it will have the same outcome, I don’t know,’ he added. And Lord Hutton said: ‘We should avoid a re-run [of 1992]. We can win the next election, we ought to win the next election. But we shouldn’t imagine that there aren’t some really difficult, hard choices to be made, not just about the economy, but also about the future shape of public services. ‘Labour has got to talk about the economy and have a message about what it will do to keep the economy moving ahead.’ Ed Miliband came under further pressure over claims that he said privately he is aiming to ‘weaponise’ the NHS as a campaign tool . Yesterday Lord Prescott raged: ‘I see those Tory collaborators Milburn and Hutton are attacking Labour’s brilliant NHS plan.’ In a reference to consultancy jobs undertaken by the pair since leaving office, the former deputy prime minister added: ‘Go back to advising Pepsi and the nuclear industry.’ But even some shadow ministers fear Labour is losing the battle on the economy – with latest figures showing the UK is now pole position to be the strongest growing country in the developed world. Tony Blair . ‘The very simple choice that people have in this next 24 hours is this. It is 24 hours to save our National Health Service’ - April 1997 . Neil Kinnock . ‘I warn you not to be ordinary. I warn you not to be young. I warn you not to fall ill. I warn you not to get old.’ - June 1983 . Michael Foot . ‘Now what they are apparently considering is the dismantlement of the health service itself, and the destruction of the essential socialist principles on which that health service was founded. Well, we will fight them on all those matters with every power’. - September 1982 . Ed Miliband . ‘I make absolutely no apologies for the fact that I’m really concerned about what’s happening to our NHS...’ - Two weeks ago . Labour’s plans suffered a further blow as Tony Blair’s former senior adviser on health warned its plans to use a mansion tax on expensive homes to fund more NHS staff would take two years to come fully on stream. Professor Paul Corrigan also claimed Mr Burnham is planning his own ‘top-down re-organisation’ by shifting responsibility for commissioning NHS services to ‘health and well-being boards’. Mr Burnham insisted Professor Corrigan had ‘misunderstood’ his proposals. In a bruising interview with BBC Newsnight, Mr Burnham came under pressure over Labour’s claim that the use of private sector firms to provide free NHS services would mean ‘the end of the health service as we know it’. He was confronted by official figures showing less than six per cent of the NHS budget is outsourced to private and not-for-profit sectors – a small rise on the 4.4 per cent that involved such providers under Labour. He repeatedly refused to say by how much Labour intended to reduce the involvement of alternative providers for free care if the party returns to power. The interventions by senior Blairites are said to be part of campaign to prevent Mr Burnham becoming Labour leader if Mr Miliband loses the election and is ousted. In the Commons, Mr Miliband insisted the NHS was in ‘crisis’, despite figures from the British Social Attitudes survey showing dissatisfaction with the health service is at a record low. The Prime Minister said Mr Miliband was ‘in a desperate mess’ over the NHS and said Labour had wrecked services in Wales, where it is in government. He repeatedly called on the Labour leader to withdraw ‘disgraceful’ remarks he reportedly made in a briefing to BBC executives about ‘weaponising’ the NHS as an election issue. Labour’s health plans include bringing in an extra 20,000 nurses and 8,000 GPs, as well as guaranteeing GP appointments in 48 hours.","Alan Milburn condemned by Lord Prescott for attacking Labour's strategy .

"WNBA star Glory Johnson, 24, is hunting for the perfect wedding dress to flatter her 6ft 3in frame. The Tulsa Shock forward takes her fiancee and fellow WNBA player Brittney Griner, 24, gown shopping at Bridals by Lori on Friday's upcoming episode of Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta. While Miss Johnson is serious about finding her dream dress, Miss Griner admits that she isn't nearly as comfortable on the bridal floor as she is on the basketball court. Scroll down for video . Winning look: WNBA star Glory Johnson models a wedding gown for her fiancee and fellow WNBA player Brittney Griner on Friday's Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta . The TLC show's fashion director Monte Durham notes in a clip from the episode that 'competition is in their blood', which isn't necessarily a good thing when it comes to searching for a wedding gown. 'When you bring that competition to the bridal floor, the only one who risks losing is the bride,' explains bridal boutique owner Lori Allen. The couple, who announced their engagement last year, are joined by a small entourage, which includes Johnson's sisters. 'My sisters help me a lot with what I want to wear,' the bride-to-be explains. But Miss Griner struggles to find the right dress for Miss Johnson. 'What is that?' Miss Johnson asks when Miss Griner holds up a poofy gown. 'No?' Miss Griner replies. 'You know what? I am going to retry. I am going to try again.' As they continue to search through the racks filled with gowns, Miss Griner hypothesizes that 'the best dress will be on the mannequin because they want you to see it'. The Phoenix Mercury center is soon seen lugging a dressed mannequin  to the fitting room for her fiancee. 'I consider the dresses on the mannequins my all-stars,' Ms Allen later admits. But Miss Johnson isn't so sure of her fiancee's approach to dress shopping. Looking for the one: Miss Johnson and Miss Griner sit in the waiting room at Bridals by Lori in Atlanta, Georgia and explain what they are looking for in a dress . All-star choice: The first dress Miss Johnson tries on is a strapless ball gown that Miss Griner had chosen . Miss Johnson's entourage, including her fiancee Miss Griner (far right), are seen critiquing her dress choices . 'I don't even know if they are taking it seriously,' she says. 'I'm taking it seriously. I am up there trying to find a dress.' The first dress Miss Johsnon tries on is the strapless beaded ball gown that Miss Griner had seen on the mannequin. 'It's really pretty,' she says while modeling the dress. She notes: 'I am very shocked that I like the dress. I am shocked that Brittney and Jay were the ones who picked this one out.' While viewers will have to wait till Friday to see which gown Miss Johnson thinks is the one, Ms Allen says dressing the basketball star was not as she 'had envisioned'. 'I expected this fabulous athlete - who would not really want to look like a traditional bride,' she says. 'I'm thinking maybe a pants suit? Boy was I wrong.' Miss Allen explains: 'Ultimately Glory was very traditional and was only interested in pleasing Brittany - like most other brides. This is why I love bridal. It keeps you on your toes. In the end, Glory looked glorious - no pun intended.' Although bridal gowns are not in her area of expertise, Miss Griner says: 'Being on the show is super exciting.' 'I was nervous, but I knew at the end of the day we would have a dress,' she notes. 'It also let me know how real things are. When I saw Glory in her dress I just couldn't keep the tears back.'","Glory Johnson, 24, takes her fiancee and fellow WNBA player Brittney Griner, 24, gown shopping at Bridals by Lori on Friday's upcoming episode of Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta ."
"Criminal record: Amanda Shepherd threw a red wax crayon which bounced off a table and hit a toddler . A nursery nurse's career is in ruins after she shouted 'shut up' at a whining toddler and threw a crayon which bounced off a table and hit him. Amanda Shepherd, 24, was sacked and now has a criminal record after snapping at the 18-month-old boy, who was left with a red mark on his back for ten minutes. Magistrates heard she had a six-year unblemished record and did not mean to hit the child. But Shepherd, who was in the early stages of pregnancy and is now a doting mother herself, pleaded guilty to assault after she admitted being reckless during the incident last spring. Scarborough magistrates heard Shepherd, of Fylingthorpe on the North York Moors, was trying to calm the boy down with colleague Angela Parkin. 'It would appear that the boy had been somewhat upset and was described as whining for the majority of the morning,' said prosecutor Martin Hawes. 'Both Miss Shepherd and colleagues had trouble settling him down. Around mid-morning, Miss Parkin and Miss Shepherd were sat in the baby room.' Miss Parker was on one side of the room with a new baby admission and Shepherd was on the other with a child between her legs, the court heard. Mr Hawes said: 'The boy was by the play gate, still whining and playing with some cars. Miss Shepherd threw a red crayon, saying ""Shut up."" 'The crayon hit the child in his back and the child fell forward and started to cry.' Another nursery worker picked up the boy and calmed him down. Mr Hawes told the court the child 'suffered a small red mark on his back which disappeared after ten minutes'. The matter was reported to the manager of the nursery before police were called. Mr Hawes added: 'It would appear that Miss Shepherd accepted immediately she knew what she had done was wrong. 'But because of the nature of the case, it was brought to the police's attention. 'Miss Shepherd always accepted she had thrown the crayon. She stated it was an accident that it happened to hit. 'Assaults can be committed recklessly or deliberately. There is no suggestion the crayon was intended to hit the child and cause him to fall over. 'It was a crayon after all. Other workers were concerned that having done it there was no suggestion Miss Shepherd tried to deal with the child. Shepherd was handed 60 hours' unpaid work after admitting assault at Scarborough Magistrates' Court . 'It was left to her colleague. It was accepted it was a reckless action.' Chris Rafferty, mitigating, said his client only pleaded guilty on the basis it was a reckless act. He added: 'I would ask you to consider this as an isolated incident. 'She is a young woman of 24 and prior to this incident she had six years of unblemished employment with the nursery and very much enjoyed it. 'As a result of this one reckless action, throwing a crayon, she has now lost that employment. 'In some ways she has already been punished for this offence. It seems this must fall to the very bottom of the seriousness scale. 'There were two aggravating features - she was a carer at the time and the child was 18 months old. 'She does not seek to hide away from these facts. But until today she was a person of good character and had six years of perfect service. 'This was an entirely unusual action for her to take. The injury was of an extremely minor nature. 'A red mark appeared as a result of the crayon hitting him which then vanished ten minutes later. There were no lasting effects. 'As of now, she has not found alternative employment.' Shepherd was handed a 12-month community order with 60 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £325 court costs with a £60 surcharge.","Amanda Shepherd, 24, had six-year 'unblemished' record before incident .

"Sororities at the University of Virginia have been told to stay away from fraternity recruitment events scheduled Saturday. The sororities are part of the National Panhellenic Conference. Conference spokeswoman Michelle Bower tells The Washington Post that the mandate came from the sororities' national presidents. Bower says the conference supports the decision. U.Va. Inter-Fraternity Council President Ben Gorman tells the newspaper that some sororities were told to avoid any social gathering with fraternity members on Boys' Bid Night. Stay away: Sororities at the University of Virginia have been told to stay away from fraternity recruitment events scheduled Saturday. In this Thursday, Jan. 15, 2015 photo, University of Virginia students walk to fraternities at the start of rush week at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville . The university recently lifted a suspension of Greek social activities after fraternities and sororities agreed to stricter regulations. The suspension followed a rocky 2014 at the university. In November, a Rolling Stone article detailed an alleged gang rape at a U.Va. fraternity. Prior to that, 18-year-old student Hannah Graham disappeared in September after a bout of drinking and would later turn up dead. While the Rolling Stone article has been largely discredited and Graham's accused killer is a 32-year-old university employee and not related to a frat, this is not the first effort to curb Greek activities on campus in the wake of the events. Earlier this month, a pair of defiant University of Virginia fraternities capitulated to the school's efforts to impose new regulations on them that stemmed from a Rolling Stone article alleging a culture of rape and denial on the campus. The decision by the local chapters of Kappa Alpha and Alpha Tau Omega to join the other fraternities in signing the new, stricter fraternal organization agreement appeared to be the last piece needed to restore the normal functioning of the campus's Greek life. Despite much of the Rolling Stone article at the root of much of the Greek controversy having been discredited, national leaders of campus sororities say women should simply stay away this bid night . The decision came just hours after the start of rush night. All the U.Va. fraternities' social activities had been suspended following the November publication of the Rolling Stone story, which detailed an apparent gang-rape at a U.Va. fraternity. Though much of the article has been discredited, the school pushed ahead with the new rules to make it easier for students to know how much they're drinking and to make it harder to drug the drinks. The new party rules would ban kegs, require security personnel and ensure at least three brothers are sober. They require food and water at parties and pre-printed guest lists and forbid serving punch premixed with liquor. The university agreed to lift the suspension on the fraternities that signed. The University announced Friday that all the fraternities and sororities had signed the new deal, adding that they would revisit the agreement when it expires in May `'to evaluate any adjustments or improvements that may be warranted.' Earlier this week, Kappa Alpha and Alpha Tau Omega said the agreement would put more liability on them and they wouldn't sign it, even at the risk of losing their affiliations with the university. They criticized the suspensions as well. 'It was simply a rush to judgment in an effort to respond to a PR crisis created by the Rolling Stone article,' said Kevin O'Neill, a Washington, D.C.-based spokesman representing the two fraternities. Bad year: Last year was a conspicuous one for UVA. Not only was the school embroiled in controversy over an alleged campus rape cover-up, but 18-year-old student Hannah Graham became a household name after she went missing in September and was later found murdered . But they reversed course Friday, just hours before a deadline. 'The University has made it clear in writing today that our organizations will remain suspended if we do not sign the new FOA immediately and have rejected our requests for an extension to continue discussing our concerns. Given the threat of further sanctions and retaliation by the University the chapters reluctantly have agreed to sign the FOA so that our students can resume normal operations,' the fraternities said in a joint statement. The fraternities, which have been at U.Va. since the 1800s, said they were still exploring legal remedies and called on Congress and the Virginia legislature to protect them from such regulations. For its part, the university hoped to increase safety by opening a police substation Friday across from The Corner, a popular strip of bars and restaurants sandwiched between the university and fraternity and sorority houses. If there were concerns about the new rules changing the culture so dramatically that it would scare away potential members, it didn't show on the first night of rush Thursday. Large packs of underclassmen in khaki pants and button-down shirts roamed between fraternity houses, many of which they already visited during fall parties. Austin Beane, a 20-year-old second year student from Castle Rock, Colorado, said going through rush is a return to normalcy for the school, after months of media attention focused on the disappearance and death of student Hannah Graham and the Rolling Stone article. 'It was a rough semester for us. We're just trying to get things back to normal,' Beane said. Beane said most of the new rules made sense and won't much change the atmosphere at fraternity parties other than to make them a little safer. The unique situation at U.Va. made the two fraternities' threats to defy the school more realistic. Universities often have on-campus dormitories for fraternities or own the land under fraternity houses, allowing them to evict fraternities that don't follow school rules. But at U.Va., the houses are off campus and privately owned. The university affiliation is tangential, with each fraternity signing an agreement that repeatedly states the university doesn't supervise them. In return, the fraternities get to use a student activity center and university server space, and, more important, adopt a formal relationship with the school required by most national Greek organizations. 'U.Va.'s pretty unique,' said Gentry McCreary, a consultant for the National Center for Higher Education Risk Management who formerly oversaw Greek Life at the University of Alabama. '(Fraternities) operate very independently.' Jakob Scheidt, who was president of Phi Kappa Sigma in the fall semester, said fraternities already have effective risk-management policies in place regardless of the new rules. 'Fraternities have every incentive in the world to make their houses safe, they have every incentive to make sure bad things don't happen all on their own, apart from the university,' he said. `'Anything that happens in your house is on you and fraternities are very aware of that liability.'","Leaders at the National Panhellenic Conference have caused an outcry at University of Virginia sororities with the order .

They were told to expect loud noises and a rumbling and were warned there would be no access to the site. When built it 1978, the furnace was the largest of its type in the world and remained one of the biggest on the east coast of America until it was demolished. At its peak, up to 30,000 local people were employed at the steel mill. But in 2001, it ran into financial difficulties and went through five different owners before operations ceased in 2012. The decision was taken to develop the site of the mill last year and clean up contamination and industrial pollution. The furnace after being demolished.

Before setting off, a cyclist will choose whether they would like audio as well as haptic - or vibrating - alerts in the dedicated app for Android and Apple phones, before entering the destination in their chosen mapping app. They can then put their phone back into their pocket or bag and start cycling to get directions without looking at a screen, because the handlebars vibrate. The company, based in Montreal, Canada, claims this makes cycling safer because cyclists can keep their eyes on the road instead of reading a map on a screen. Either the left or right grip will vibrate, indicating which way to turn, or for traffic problems. Vibrations intensify the closer cyclists get to a turning to make sure they select the right road at junctions.","Visijax Commuter Jacket contains flashing LEDs on the sleeves .

"A Florida man is facing extradition to Thailand for allegedly kidnapping a businessman friend so he could extort a $2 million ransom from him - but he claims HE'S the one being scammed. Shawn Abraham Shaw, 43, was arrested in Palm Beach on November 26 after Thai authorities accused him of drugging, kidnapping and threatening to kill the man during a 2013 trip to Phuket. Shaw, who appeared at a bond hearing on Wednesday, is now waiting to see if he will be extradited to Thailand, where his attorney says he could face life behind bars or even death if he is convicted of the plot. His extradition hearing is scheduled for March 3. But Shaw claims  he is being framed by the alleged victim - a Las Vegas businessman who travels to Thailand for work - because he wants to steal one of his ideas, the Sun Sentinel reported. 'Plot': Shawn Abraham Shaw, 43, traveled to the Thai island of Phuket, pictured, in December 2013, where he drugged, kidnapped and then extorted millions from a friend, officials said. He has denied the claims . 'This man is a billionaire,' Shaw's attorney Michael Cohen told a judge at a bond hearing on December 12. 'He has ties to the king of Thailand.' The two men got to know each other while working out in the same gym when Shaw lived in Las Vegas, his attorney said, the Palm Beach Post reported. Years later, Shaw came up with an idea to recover millions in uncashed gambling chips that people take home with them from trips to Las Vegas. He then traveled to Thailand to see if the other man, identified only as AMA in court records, wanted to join him in his venture, he said. His fiance, Dawn Pasqualucci, joined him on the trip and they stayed at the man's house before leaving on good terms in December 2013, they said. But a month later, when negotiations for the business venture fell through, AMA went to authorities and told them Shaw had kidnapped him, Cohen said. Thai officials then filed charges against him. 'The so-called extortion never took place,' the attorney insisted. But Thai officials and the alleged victim tell a very different story. They said that one night, Shaw and AMA were out drinking when AMA started to feel dizzy and passed out. A barman told officials that he Shaw assist or carry AMA outside of the bar. They got into a car, where Shaw allegedly restrained the man with plastic zip ties around his wrists, ankles and neck before taking him to a building and holding him overnight. He allegedly threatened to kill the man unless he handed over $3 million. They negotiated the amount down to $2 million, which was paid to Shaw when he returned to the U.S. Shaw's new defense lawyer, Jason Kreiss, claimed at Wednesday's hearing that emails from the time show that his client's activities involved a legitimate business deal, the Sun Sentinel reported. Arrest: He was arrested at his girlfriend' home on this beach-front street in Palm Beach in November and has been held in custody ever since. He now faces extradition to Thailand to answer to the charges . The alleged victim did not report the incident to authorities until several weeks after Shaw had left the country, claiming he feared for his life and worried he would hurt his family. Pasqualucci, 45, testified that she believed the alleged victim was a pedophile who frequented transgender bars in Thailand and that he had dished out threats of his own. She said he had threatened to have them killed if they revealed that Shaw had seen something on the victim's computer that indicated, 'He likes little boys', the Sun Sentinel reported. Shaw, a Guyana-born U.S. citizen who has lived in the states for about 35 years, did not speak during the three-hour bond hearing on Wednesday. Federal prosecutor Aurora Fagan told the court last month that the Thai authorities should be the ones decided whose story is the true one. 'We're dealing with international law and international relations,' she said. 'They (Thai authorities) should not have to litigate their case here in American courts.' At the bond hearing on Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge William Matthewman said he will decide over the next few days if he should release Shaw on bond. He could next appear at an extradition hearing on March 3. Thailand and the U.S. have an extradition treaty. 'I think all of this would certainly make for an interesting trial - in Thailand,' the judge said, adding that it could be an embarrassment for the U.S. if he freed Shaw and then he went on the run. Kreiss said they were willing to 'vigorously fight' the extradition process in federal court.","Shawn Abraham Shaw 'drugged, kidnapped and threatened to kill his friend if he didn't hand over millions of dollars during a 2013 trip to Phuket'

"Do you automatically cut your sandwiches into triangles, get tiddly on one glass of wine and use words like 'sugar' and 'fudge' instead of their four-letter counterparts? You must be a mum. According to a new survey, the top 50 signs that you're a mother include hilarious giveaways such as buying gallons of milk, always having wet wipes to hand and knowing the words to Let It Go. Scroll down for video . Gallons of milk in your shopping? Cutting sandwiches into triangles? You must be a mum . They also yearn for a lie in, have photos of their children as a screensaver and have learnt how to swear under their breath. Mothers are permanently tired and wired, rushing everywhere and can only find time to watch television on  catch-up or Sky Plus. You'll also find a cabinet dedicated to medicines in a mother's home and a massive family organiser on the wall. The findings emerged in a study of 2,000 mothers, which looked at the tell-tale signs of someone who has clearly had children. They're also able to sleep clinging to the edge of the bed because their child is sleeping horizontally beside them. They also find it almost impossible to leave the house without asking everyone if they have been to the toilet. Comfort becomes a higher priority over fashion too, as further signs of motherhood included finding bigger pants more comfortable and owning a selection of comfy shoes. The exclamations 'sugar' and 'fudge' are more common ways for mothers to curse, and sandwiches start to always be cut into triangles- regardless of who they're for. Always having wet wipes to hand and knowing the words to Let It Go are signs a woman has small children . Mothers don't get queasy at the thought of poo, wee or sick and they drive around in a people carrier because 'it seems like a good idea to own one'. The research found that they tend to jiggle the shopping trolley as though it was a buggy and they'll instinctively grab their companion's hand when crossing the road - even if the person's an adult. Mothers can spot a high temperature at ten paces and they know all the words to kids' TV tunes and the most irritating pop songs. Asda carried out the survey to celebrate their in-store baby and toddler event which ends on Sunday, 8 February. The supermarket's spokeswoman Lauren Venters said: 'Mums have a natural instinct to be prepared for all eventualities when they have children. 'From stocking up on milk to always having nappies, tissues and wet wipes stored away in their handbag - mum is most definitely a wonder woman. 'We can tell that mum rarely puts herself first, and when she finally gets round to relaxing in the evening with a nice glass of red, it ends up going straight to her head. 'This top five signs of being a mum has taught us a lot and while many can give you a little giggle, we recognise they really go out of their way to make sure their children are happy and healthy.' 1.

"An eight-year-old boy was interrogated by police in France after his school reported him for 'praising terrorism'. The child - called Ahmed - allegedly refused to take part in a minute's silence at his school, in Nice, on January 8 in honour of the victims of the terror attacks in Paris earlier this month, according to Marcel Authier, head of the region's public security. The boy's teacher said the child also expressed 'solidarity' with the Islamist gunmen, who shot dead 12 at the offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on January 7. An eight-year-old boy was questioned by police in France after allegedly 'praising terrorism'. Pictured, a man holds a giant pencil during a solidarity march in tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo murders . The child was questioned by police for half an hour on Wednesday, thelocal.fr reported. Mr Authier, who said no complaint has been filed against the child, said: 'In the current context, the principal of the school decided to report to police what had happened. 'We summoned the child and his father to try and comprehend how an eight-year-old boy could hold such radical ideas.' He added: 'Obviously, the child doesn't understand what he's saying.' Sefen Guez Guez, who is the boy's lawyer, wrote on Twitter that the child admitted saying the words: 'I am with the terrorists'. But when police asked him what 'terrorism' meant, he said: 'I don't know'. The boy was questioned by police at the St Augustine police station in Nice, pictured. When officers asked the boy what 'terrorism' was, he replied: 'I don't know' The Collective Against Islamophobia group, in a statement, said: 'Father and son are deeply shocked by their treatment which illustrates the collective hysteria that has engulfed France since early January.' They added that police questioned the boy, who suffers from sleep disorder and behavioural problems for up to two hours. The group said the boy, being a Muslim, naively said he was with the terrorists because he opposed the satirical cartoons of Prophet Muhammad in the magazine. The murders at the Charlie Hebdo headquarters led to three days of terror attacks by Islamists in Paris that left 17 people dead. An Islamophobia watchdog said the boy was naive and France has been engulfed in 'collective hysteria' since the attacks.

"Fiddling with buttons on a dashboard, smartphones and sat-navs can distract drivers, increasing the chances of a crash. But a patent submitted by Google hints that the Californian tech giant may be working on a hands-free dashboard, enabling future drivers to keep their eyes on the road. It suggests that cars may be controlled in a similar way to tablets or smartphones - by using hand gestures to make audio and heating systems more intuitive to use, for example. A patent submitted by Google hints that the Californian tech giant is working on a hands-free dashboard, enabling future drivers to keep their eyes on the road. This image shows a driver using a gesture to control the air conditioning system . The patent, which was awarded to Google on 27 January, indicates that sensors could be embedded in the car’s interior to pick up a driver’s gestures. For example, a driver could swipe downwards with their hand to open a window, or swipe it over an air vent to adjust the temperature and strength of air flow. The idea is that drivers would be able to concentrate harder on the road and keep one hand on the wheel at all times. The patent indicates that sensors could be embedded in the car’s interior to pick up a driver’s gestures (illustrated)) While Google files a lot of patents, and many of them don’t appear in future products, it is possible that the company may incorporate its idea into its autonomous car. Quartz spotted that the car in the patent diagrams resembles its original self-driving prototype and the patent says the car is ‘configured to operate in an autonomous mode’. Google's self-driving cars will be designed to exceed maximum speed limits, in a move to improve safety. The lead engineer for the project has revealed the vehicles will go 10mph (16km/h) faster than the speed limit to avoid the Google car being significantly slower than speeding vehicles around it, which would increase the risk of an accident. Dmitri Dolgov, the lead software engineer for the project, said research showed that sticking to the speed limit when other cars are speeding can be dangerous. Therefore, the car’s speed would be altered depending on traffic conditions. Other companies are developing cutting-edge ways to make driving safer too. Mercedes-Benz has teamed up with LG to create a concept car capable of taking over if it thinks the driver is feeling sleepy. The idea is that drivers would be able to concentrate harder on the road and keep one hand on the wheel by using a variety of gestures (above), such as swiping over an air conditioning vent to increase the temperature . The car in the patent diagrams resembles its self-driving prototype and the patent says the car is ‘configured to operate in an autonomous mode’. An image of Google's latest autonomous car is shown . Gestures could also be used to control a car's sound system. This illustration shows a driver tapping their ear to turn off music swiftly, which could be useful in difficult driving conditions . A survey has revealed that one in seven drivers who use a sat-nav, make impromptu illegal or risky manoeuvres to correct mistakes when following GPS instructions. The statistics, gathered by road safety charity Brake and insurance firm Direct Line, suggest that urgent u-turns are not the only danger. The study says that one in 14 drivers have had a near miss and have swerved or braked suddenly to avoid a hazard because they were distracted by a sat-nav. A total of seven per cent of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted to being distracted by the stereo, while 12 per cent said they took their full attention away from the road because of passengers. A total of three per cent of people said they were distracted by their smartphone, while two per cent were preoccupied by food and drink. The futuristic car will use LG’s Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) technology to automatically dim headlights, brake and stay in lane, while biometric systems will monitor the driver’s eye movements and alertness to make sure they don’t fall asleep at the wheel. It can plot the location of lane markings, to make sure the car doesn’t drift out of lane. The cameras also spot when cars are approaching and will automatically dim the headlights to avoid dazzling the oncoming driver. Elsewhere, the system brakes automatically if it spots potential dangers such as cyclists and pedestrians. Honda has showcased a new system that can read road signs and spot pedestrians to lessen the chance of collisions. The Japanese company’s ‘Sensing’ technology offers a collection of driving aids to make journeys safer and easier for drivers. They work using a ‘millimetre-wave radar’ which is fitted to a car’s radiator grille and a monocular camera mounted near the car’s rear-view mirror. Meanwhile, Jaguar is planning see-through car pillars to eradicate the blind spot by using cameras to make the pillars 'transparent' when the driver looks towards them and give them 360 degree vision. The cameras are fitted to the outside frame of the car to provide a live feed onto screens on the pillars inside the car. This essentially makes them see-through, with the feed kicking in the moment the driver indicates, moves their head over their shoulder or approaches a junction. It is hoped the technology, which is still in concept form, could reduce the potential for accidents. Many of the large car companies are working on their own smart safety devices. For example, Honda has showcased a new system that can read road signs and spot pedestrians to lessen the chance of collisions, using a camera and radar (illustrated) A study of in-vehicle video footage estimated that 22 per cent of crashes could be caused, at least in part, by driver distraction. It also showed that drivers who perform a secondary task at the wheel are two to three times more likely to crash. Other studies have found that more complex secondary tasks, like talking on a mobile phone or texting, increase crash risk even more. Researchers at the University of Western Australia have shown that talking on a phone (hands-free or hand-held) makes drivers four times more likely to have a serious crash, and texting raises the odds further. A study by Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety in Massachusetts found that while drivers may think they can multitask, 98 per cent are not able to divide their attention without a significant deterioration in driving performance. Scientists at Royal Holloway University of London found that using a sat-nav can increase driver speed and reduce observation, but research has also found that using a voice-based sat-nav is safer than using a visual display or paper map. Listening to loud music has been found to slow drivers’ reaction times, and encourages aggressive driving, according to researchers at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. Monash University Accident Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia, found that fiddling with a stereo while driving leads to slower reaction times and more errors such as accidentally lane drifting. Devices such as cruise control, aimed at reducing the driver’s workload, can also have the unintended side-effect of making drivers less attentive and more susceptible to fatigue, a study by the University of Toronto concludes.","Google patent suggests systems could be controlled using hand gestures .

"Harry Farmer, 14, (right) was put in school isolation two weeks ago after having his hair cut like his 44-year-old father, Stacey Farmer (left) A teenager has been banned from the classroom for having the same haircut as his father after teachers ruled it too 'extreme'. Harry Farmer, 14, has been studying in school isolation for the last two weeks after getting a standard short back and sides cut but has been told he will have to stay there until it grows out. His father, Stacey Farmer, who has the same popular hairstyle, is concerned the Year 9 pupil is missing out on vital lessons after spending so much time away from the classroom environment. Mr Farmer, 44, who lives in Durrington, West Sussex, with wife Julie, 39, son Harry and younger daughter Lily, said: 'This is absolute madness.' The NHS subcontractor, who installs disability hoists, added: 'I have to be smart for my job, as I represent my company and the health service and go into homes of the elderly and vulnerable. 'I wouldn't have a hair style that wasn't smart, and I wouldn't let my son either.' 'I can't believe how long they're keeping him out of the classroom. 'He's a good boy and got lots of friends, but he even has to eat lunch on his own because the school reckon his haircut is ""dangerous"".' Chris Woodcock, the deputy head of Durrington High School, where Harry attends, is standing by the school's tough stance on so-called 'extreme' hairstyles. He said: 'We continue to have consistent and clear expectations of all students in terms of uniform and personal presentation in school. 'Our expectations have been consistent for a number of years now and as a result of working closely with students and their parents - by confirming expectations and any specific changes in advance through letters, emails, on our website and through student planners and assemblies. 'The vast majority of students present themselves exceptionally well each and every day.' But Mr Farmer has reprimanded the school and said the haircut is 'not extreme by any means'. 'It's slightly longer on top and swept to one side like all the lads have,' he said. 'There's no colours, it's not like he's been running around with a Mohawk. 'He's absolutely devastated. He's always been good at school. I think he's getting to the point where he feels victimised. 'I said to the school ""you're pushing him to a point he's going to turn around and rebel"", but they couldn't care less. The deputy head teacher at Durrington High School (pictured) has said they will stick by their tough uniform and personal presentation policy . 'If we shave his head then it will be swapping one style for another and they'll still keep him in isolation. 'I would never let my son have an extreme hair style - I was with him when he got it cut and didn't see anything wrong with it. And I still don't.' This year Harry will choose the subjects he wants to study for his GCSEs and will have to sit exams to decide which study groups he will be placed in for Year 10. Mr Farmer is worried that the disruption to his son's education could have an adverse effect on his exam results. He added: 'This is the year they are taking their options which has made me even more frustrated. 'Harry is growing up and wants to take pride in his appearance. I'm proud of him. But the school just want robots, everyone to be exactly the same and to conform.'","Harry Farmer, 14, has been put in school isolation for two weeks for style .

"If there was a sex scandal swirling around Prince Andrew it didn’t show yesterday as he returned to royal duties after an attempt to have him testify  about underage 'sex slave' Virginia Roberts failed. He was photographed laughing heartily in front of a Union Jack as he donned his naval uniform for a ceremony at RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset. The prince has vehemently denied allegations in the US that he slept with 17-year-old Virginia Roberts, who alleges she was ‘procured’ for him by his close friend, convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Scroll down for video . Back to work: The Duke of York laughs during a visit to Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, Somerset, today as it emerged a second attempt to have him testify on oath over sex claims failed . Having fun: Putting aside pressure in his personal life, the Prince, who was dressed in uniform, looked relaxed at the ceremony, right, and during a tour of the station, left . Last week, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he broke his silence on the controversy, saying he wanted to ‘reiterate and reaffirm’ Buckingham Palace statements that insist he never had any kind of sexual contact or relationship with his accuser. Since then the prince has tried to put the scandal to one side with a ‘business as usual approach’ to his public duties, which yesterday involved presenting four Royal Navy helicopter pilots and two observers with their wings. Miss Roberts, who claims she had sex three times with the Duke of York when she was 17, a claim he emphatically denies, served papers on him via the British Embassy in Washington but they were returned to sender. Dressed in uniform he said: 'Just being here today at one of these very, very important ceremonies in the life of the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm brought back memories to me when I was stood where these young people were a long time ago'. But he did not mention the sex allegations a week after his public denial in Davos. In uniform: The Duke of York donned full uniform for the ceremony at RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset . A female Royal Navy pilot from Staffordshire made history as she received her Wings from Prince Andrew. Lieutenant Danielle Welch, 30, is the very first and last woman to become a Royal Navy abinitio Lynx pilot. She was awarded her Wings by the Duke of York during a ceremony at RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset after five-and-a-half years' training. Award: Lieutenant Danielle Welch, 30, is the very first and last woman to become a Royal Navy abinitio Lynx pilot. She received her wings from the Duke of York, left, during a ceremony today . She said: 'My family and friends are all very proud. 'This is something I have been trying to achieve for most of my life and when I found out I had been selected it was brilliant. 'The course is tough. We started the Lynx course with six and we've ended with four. Previous courses have a similar attrition rate. 'Not everyone gets through but to achieve it is brilliant.' She added: 'I am deploying operationally this summer, so I am looking forward to doing the job I have been training for.' Prince Andrew also presented Wings to Lieutenant Rhydian Edwards, who also qualified to fly the Lynx, and Lieutenants Thomas Lofthouse and Matthew Clark, who will fly the Sea King. Lieutenant Max Crosby and Sub-Lieutenant Christian Smith received their observer wings. The attempt by Miss Roberts' legal team to serve papers on Prince Andrew came a week after couriers FedEx returned a similar letter because it was 'refused' by the recipient at Buckingham Palace. The letter to the Prince says: 'This is a formal request to interview you under oath at a time and place of your choosing.' The Foreign Office has said they refused to take the legal papers because sending them to a British Embassy was not the 'appropriate way' to serve them. A spokesman said: 'Documents were incorrectly sent to our embassy in Washington. As they were not served via the appropriate channels, we are returning the documents so they can be sent by the agreed international channels for the transmission of legal papers.' Virginia Roberts (right) has claimed that she was forced by  financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17, pictured together in early 2001 . Prince Andrew spoke for the first time last week to deny the sex accusations, at the World Economic Forum . The letter tops a damaging month for Andrew since he was sensationally accused in U.S. court papers of abusing Miss Roberts when she was 17. She alleged that under the orders of billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, she was ‘forced’ to have sex with him three times in 2001 - in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island. Andrew, 54, fiercely denies ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with Miss Roberts and has consulted top criminal QC William Clegg. A week ago Andrew spoke publicly to deny that he had sex with Miss Roberts. In an unprecedented move, he used a televised speech in Davos to 'reaffirm' Buckingham Palace's emphatic denials that he had ever had 'any form of sexual contact or relationship' with his accuser. Reading from carefully scripted notes, the prince said: 'Firstly I think I must, and want, for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last few weeks. 'And I just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham Palace.' Miss Roberts's lawyers sent Buckingham Palace a letter (above) requesting his 'voluntary cooperation in answering questions about his sexual interactions' with her - but it was not accepted . In new documents, Miss Roberts (left) also launched a stinging attack on the Duke's (right) denials of her allegations. She claims they had sex when she was 17 . Prince Andrew, left, has been dragged into the controversy surrounding convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein (right). The two are pictured together in Central Park, in New York . The royal had been under under growing pressure to speak about the case. His accuser lodged fresh documents at a Florida court saying her lawyers had served an extraordinary letter on the Duke last week requesting he answer questions – but he ‘refused’ to accept it. Miss Roberts also issued a stinging attack on ‘false and hurtful’ denials of her claims made by Andrew in the tumultuous past three weeks. She claimed his police bodyguards left her alone with him the first time he had sex with her and that she was involved in an orgy with the prince and eight other young girls. Buckingham Palace has strenuously rejected claims the Duke had any ‘sexual contact or relationship’ with Miss Roberts. In her latest court salvo, Miss Roberts states: ‘I have seen Buckingham Palace’s recent “emphatic” denial that Prince Andrew had sexual contact with me. That denial is false and hurtful to me. I did have sexual contact with him as I have described…under oath'. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Prince Andrews awarded Royal Navy pilots with their Wings today .

'I get stopped by people at the gym who want to let me know that because they saw me, they were able to finish that last set, or didn't quit their workout early and go home. 'When I go hiking I get stopped for photos and handshakes by people who express how they are going to push aside their excuses because they saw me pushing aside mine. 'And, I'm constantly contacted by other physically disabled individuals who thought they were the only one.' For full video please visit the Barstarzz YouTube Channel . That, he said, is why he was inspired to make a documentary about his own experiences. 'That's why I keep pushing,' he added. 'For the people whose lives I can make even a small difference in, I do it for them. 'And the production of this video documentary will help me continue to do that. 'This video will reach hundreds of thousands of people with my story, and that of all adaptive athletes.' Luke was born without his left arm, and half of his left lung was also missing. Later he developed scoliosis and eight years ago doctors diagnosed him with type 1 diabetes. 'As a child I had always insisted on doing everything myself and never taking the easy way out,' he said. 'I've never seen any reason why I couldn't do something myself - swimming, surfing, rock climbing, or Crossfit. 'If I want something bad enough, I'll find a way to make it happen.' Luke has been training in the gym for years, but started doing Crossfit around two years ago. He said embarking on the workouts forced him to modify them to suit his body. In November, he embarked on a mission to produce a documentary to help inspire other adaptive athletes . He and his videographer friend filmed Luke training ahead of the Wodapalooza Fitness Festival, a three-day event in Miami, as well as capturing footage of him performing at the event . He said he is inspired to film himself, to show others they can do anything. He said: 'That's why I keep pushing. For the people whose lives I can make even a small difference in, I do it for them' 'I had to do a lot of things differently,' he said. 'Scaling down the weights and modifying the movements so that I could do them all with one arm. 'In the last year I decided to stop putting limits on myself, and started to work towards working out at the same level as everyone else. 'I often get weird looks when I set down the dumb bell and walk over to the barbell to attempt a power clean, dead lift, or back squat. 'But, I never let those looks hold me back.' In November, Luke took part in the Working Wounded fitness Competition. In the aftermath he experienced an outpouring of support, his photos and videos shared and liked on social media more than 300,000 times. He was invited to take part in the Wodapalooza Fitness Festival, a three-day event in Miami with more than 1,100 athletes from eight countries taking part. On January 4, his friend Andrew travelled to Hawaii to film him training for nine days. They captured footage of Luke working out in his back yard, hiking, rock climbing, swimming, sailing and running. Luke said his determination stems from his childhood, when he insisted on doing everything for himself' He then travelled to Miami with Luke to film him competing in the contest, which ran from January 16 to 18. He said: 'I've never seen any reason why I couldn't do something myself - swimming, surfing, rock climbing, or Crossfit. If I want something bad enough, I'll find a way to make it happen' Andrew, who first met Luke around a year ago, said: 'I immediately recognised his drive for life.' In another video, Luke added: 'It is your body, it is your life. 'You only get one of each, one body and one life, you want to enjoy your time on this earth. 'Being healthy, feeling healthy, there is nothing better than that. 'There is lots of people, lots with different, whether it's physical disabilities or confidence issues and internal angst, that use it as an excuse for them not to do something, whether that be fitness or a job or a hobby that they love, or a relationship that they don't pursue. 'They let all these different fears stop them from doing something. Just don't. Don't let anything or anyone stop you from being happy.' With a goal of collecting $2,500 to fund their project, the pair were delighted to find their target was reached on January 19. Visit the Barstarzz YouTube Channel for more videos.

"Being trampled on by a three-tonne elephant is not usually the first thing that springs to mind when thinking about ways to relieve stress. But tourists  are flocking to a jungle camp in Thailand for just that. The spa treatment is being offered in Chang Mai province, where a number of Asian elephants - that weigh anywhere from 2.25 to 5.5 tonnes - administer the massage using their trunks and feet.

"A pair of music-loving bartenders are serving up pub sing-alongs with a difference - after inventing a piano capable of making drinks. Antonia Dumitrescu and Raluca Macalet, from Bucharest in Romania, have created a 'Pianocktail' that can mix up to five different types of cocktail, including Bloody Marys and Manhattans. Not content with just serving up the odd dram of whisky, the pair have designed the instrument to make complicated concoctions with each drink represented by a different piece of music. A pair of music-loving bartenders have invented a piano capable of mixing a range of cocktails . Antonia Dumitrescu and Raluca Macalet, from Bucharest in Romania, have created a 'Pianocktail' that can mix up to five different types of drink, including Bloody Marys and Manhattans . The pair have designed the instrument to make complicated concoctions with each drink represented by a different piece of music . When pianist Sandra Popescu, 26, starts playing, the ingredients are mixed together and served up in a bowl. Ms Dumitrescu, 27, said: 'The operating principle is rather simple; when you hit a key it triggers an impulse which makes the beverage flow from a certain container, mix on a chute, drop in a bowl and creates the cocktail for the specific piece of music. 'So, when for example, Sandra plays Beethoven's Fur Elise, the piano makes a Manhattan.' Ms Macalet, also 27, added: 'The idea came from reading a book by French author Boris Vian called Froth on the Daydream. 'There's a scene in the book where a piano makes cocktails, with every song having a different flavour and I thought it would be great to be able to taste a melody.' Raluca Macalet (left) and Antonia Dumitrescu (right) say they want to expand the number of drinks it can make . When the pianist hits certain keys it triggers a device which makes the drink flow from its container before the liquid drains off into a mixing bowl . The duo, who are both 27-years-old, have now applied to have their musical invention registered . Now the pair, who are taking their cocktail-making piano around the capital, say they want to expand the number of drinks it can make. Ms Dumitrescu said: 'At the moment it can only make five, but in the future we want to be able to do more, which will mean not only more drinks but more songs too.' So far their piano cocktail is proving a hit. Pub-goer Nicolae Maniu, 25, said: 'It's pretty cool although it does take a bit of time to get your drink. 'And they don't do requests so you can't really have a good singalong. But the drinks are good and its early days yet so I'm excited to see where this goes.' The duo have now applied to have their invention registered.","Friends Antonia Dumitrescu and Raluca Macalet invented the 'Pianocktail'

"Improved car design and safety technology means that crash fatalities are in rapid decline, according to a new industry report. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that in 2012 there were 28 driver deaths per million cars produced in 2011. This compared to 48 for 2008 and 2009 vehicle models, marking a 41per cent decrease in motoring deaths over  three years of manufacturing. Scroll down for video . Trend: Improved car design and safety technology means that crash fatalities are in rapid decline, according to a new industry report . David Zuby, IIHS executive vice president and chief research officer, said of the findings: 'We know from our vehicle ratings program that crash test performance has been getting steadily better. 'These latest death rates provide new confirmation that real-world outcomes are improving, too.' Crucial changes that could have saved lives include the redesign of airbags and seat belts. Many car brands worked at developing stronger structures and kitting models out with safety gizmos such as anti-lock brakes and electronic stability controls. A weak economy was also attributed to the fall in motoring deaths as it could have led to a reduction in driving. But the gap between safest and riskiest models remains wide. Three 2011 models had rates exceeding 100 deaths per million registered vehicle years. The riskiest models also were mostly lower-priced, small cars, while the safest models were all mid-sized or large vehicles. The nine models with zero deaths were the Audi A4 , Honda Odyssey, Kia Sorento, Lexus RX 350, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, Subaru Legacy, Toyota Highlander hybrid, Toyota Sequoia and Volvo XC90. Drop in deaths: Crucial changes that could have saved lives include the redesign of airbags and seat belts . The vehicles with the highest death rates were the Kia Rio, 149 deaths per million registered vehicles; Nissan Versa, 130 deaths, and Hyundai Accent, 120 deaths. The institute has published death rates by make and model periodically since 1989, at first for cars only and later for all passenger vehicles. The rates include only driver deaths because the presence of passengers is unknown. Although the latest numbers reflect 2011 models, the study included data from earlier-model year vehicles as far back as 2008 if the vehicles weren't substantially redesigned before 2011. Including older, equivalent vehicles increases the exposure and thus the accuracy of the results, the institute said. To be included, a vehicle must have had at least 100,000 registered vehicle years of exposure during 2009-12, or at least 20 deaths. The Insurance Institute for Highway safety examined fatalities involving 2011 model year vehicles, looking at how many driver fatalities occurred in a particular model over the course of a year of operation, expressed as a rate per million registered vehicle years. Here are the 2011 vehicle models with highest and lowest death rates: . TEN LOWEST DEATH RATES . Audi A4 4WD*, luxury mid-sized car, 0 deaths . Honda Odyssey, large minivan, 0 deaths .

"Dramatic CCTV footage has shown the moment a mentally ill 17-year-old girl was shot dead by police after she lunged at officers with a butcher's knife. Kristiana Coignard was killed in the lobby of Longview Police Station in Texas on Wednesday after a Taser failed to stop her. The shooting has come in for criticism amid increased scrutiny in the United States surrounding law enforcement's use of deadly force. Scroll down for video . The in the footage released by Longview Police Department, the 17-year-old can be seen lunging at officers with a butcher's knife . It is thought the Coignard had also held up her hand, where she had wrote, 'I have a gun' on her skin . Today Longview Police have released the CCTV footage of the incident, which shows Coignard entering the foyer of the police station and using the lobby phone. It is thought she requested help but would not say why she needed it. Officer Glenn Derr, who was the first to respond can then be seen approaching the teenager, who held up her hand, which had 'I have a gun' written on it. The footage then shows Officer Derr struggling with the girl and trying to subdue her and at one point, the officer throws her to the ground. As she lies on the floor, Officer Derr can be seen kneeling and holding her down, before he suddenly gets up and steps back. The police officers back away from Coignard who is lying on the floor after realising she has a knife . One of the officers then uses a Taser gun on the teenager before the other two follow up with gun shots . It is thought he broke away when he realised that Coignard was reaching for a butcher's knife she had hidden in her waistband. Officers Gene Duffie and Grace Bagley then arrive on the scene as Coignard is seen charging at Derr. Officer Duffie then fires his Taser before Officers Derr and Bagley quickly followed with gunshots. Further details of the shooting emerged following statements from Longview Police Chief Don Dingler and spokeswoman Kristie Brian. Chief Dingler said the officers were justified in shooting the girl. He said: 'All the patrol officers carry Tasers, plus expandable batons. Kristiana Coignard, 17, who was shot dead by the officers. Her aunt said that her niece had a history of mental health problems . After Coignard was shot four times in the station on Thursday (pictured), three Longview police officers were placed on paid leave on Friday . 'I think you'll see from the video that the time was a factor. There was no time for the officers to use other means.' All three officers are on paid administrative leave while the Texas Rangers investigate the shooting. The girl's family has said she had mental health problems and have questioned why police had to shoot her. She had been living with her aunt, Heather Robertson, before her death. Ms Robertson said her niece had been battling mental illness, including bipolar disorder and depression, and had been hospitalized twice after attempting suicide, Think Progress reported. She said Coignard 'was only violent with herself' and has questioned the events in the police station. 'I think it was a cry for help. I think they could have done something.' 'They are grown men. I think there is something they are not telling us.'","Kristiana Coignard, 17, was killed in the lobby of a Texas police station .

"This brings new meaning to the term fast food. Frightening footage has surfaced of a fridge toppling off the back of moving ute and skidding across the path of oncoming traffic on a bustling highway in Brisbane. The dash-cam vision, which comes from Ipswich road, begins with traffic moving down a busy thoroughfare on a cloudy day. Scroll down for video . The dash-cam vision begins with traffic moving down a Ipswich road in Brisbane on a cloudy day . A fridge topples off the back of moving ute and skids across the path of oncoming traffic . After passing a road-sign, the fridge plunges over the back of the tray and slides across the road, forcing quick thinking drivers to swerve out of its path. The video was uploaded to YouTube  on Thursday by Angelilina Lulu,  who has  uploaded several other dash-cam videos to her account. According to the Department of Transport and Main Roads for Queensland, any vehicle carrying a load must secure the load so it won’t move or fall from the vehicles while driving. Loads must be restrained using an appropriate restraint method so they will not eject into the path of traffic or pedestrians. Failing to secure the load properly can result in a fine or, for a serious breach, a prosecution in court. The quick thinking drivers are forced to swerve out of the path of the fridge . According to the Department of Transport and Main Roads, drivers can be prosecuted for failing to properly secure a load on a moving vehicle . In 2010, a fridge fell off the back of a lorry truck in Britain, crushing a grandmother to death. Susan Russell, 54, was cycling to work when the nine-ton fridge slipped from the vehicle and fell on her, killing her instantly in Hull, East Yorkshire. Lorry driver Mark Smith, 47, from Bradford, had only placed two safety belts around the industrial appliance that should have been held in place by dozens of straps.","Footage has surfaced of a fridge slipping off the back of moving ute .

"The drug Tamiflu gets flu victims back on their feet faster and reduces complications, claim researchers after the most exhaustive investigation to date. A major analysis of all published and unpublished trials found it shortens symptoms by a day and cuts the risk of ancillary infections and hospital care. Controversy has raged over the effectiveness of the drug, with allegations that regulators, researchers and doctors did not have access to vital information from clinical trials. Controversy: Debate had raged over how effective Tamiflu was - but the new study claims that it cuts hospital admissions for flu by 63% and shortens symptoms of the virus by a day . Last year, a review concluded Tamiflu and Relenza did not reduce admission to hospital or complications from flu such as pneumonia – a key reason for Governments worldwide to stockpile them to reduce the impact of a pandemic. But new evidence published in The Lancet journal shows Tamiflu is more effective than previously thought. The research by the University of Michigan, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Alabama found the drug shortens the duration of symptoms by about one day and reduces by 44 per cent respiratory infections that sometimes develop. Study co-author Dr Arnold Monto, the Thomas Francis Jr. Collegiate Professor of Public Health at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said ‘This is the first patient-level analysis of how well this drug works. ‘Previous research has questioned its success and use in light of the side effects of nausea and vomiting, but the other studies combined those infected with influenza and those without, which diluted the positive effect in treatment.’ Researchers conducted meta-analysis of data from all published and unpublished clinical trials – made available by manufacturer Roche - from 1997-2001. More than 4,300 patients were involved – more than half of whom were treated with Tamiflu. The drug shortens the duration of symptoms by about one day and reduces respiratory infections that sometimes develop by 44 per cent, researchers found . The drug, also known as oseltamivir, was shown to reduce the duration of the illness by 21 per cent. With the drug, symptom alleviation occurred, on average, at 98 hours compared with 123 hours with placebo. In addition to reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections requiring antibiotics, like pneumonia (4.9 per cent had complications with the drug compared with 8.7 per cent on placebo), the drug decreased hospital admissions by 63 per cent. The researchers also found some of the same complications of the drug noted in previous research, with an increase in nausea (3.7 per cent) and vomiting (4.7 per cent). They did not find more neurological or psychological disorders in those taking the drug. Professor Peter Openshaw, Director of the Centre for Respiratory Infection at Imperial College London, said: ‘The important thing about this study is that it shows that Roche were not hiding skeletons in its cupboards. ‘As a full review of the published and unpublished data, it leaves the conclusion unaltered that oseltamivir reduces symptom duration by about a day while causing nausea and vomiting in a minority of recipients. The drug decreased hospital admissions from influenza (pictured under the microscope) by 63 per cent . ‘Oseltamivir is not a perfect drug but does what you might expect of an antiviral given relatively late in the course of an acute infection and after the illness has already become established. ‘The finding that it reduces hospitalisation by 63 per cent is especially important, reinforcing the call for family practitioners to use antivirals early rather than resorting to antibiotics, which are of no proven benefit in uncomplicated flu.’ Dr John McCauley, Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza, MRC National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), said the use of antiviral medicines can have an important role in reducing the impact of flu. He added: ‘The authors of the current study concluded that oseltamivir treatment resulted in shorter periods of illness, and moreover, because of the ability to put together the results from many trials, the authors concluded that influenza patients treated with oseltamivir had a reduced risk of being hospitalised or having antibiotics prescribed for lower respiratory tract infection. ‘However, the authors also noted that treatment with oseltamivir induced an increased rate of reporting nausea, and pointed out that the risks and benefits of oseltamivir use still need to be considered carefully.’","New research claims Tamiflu more effective than previously thought .

"The world's urban areas have experienced significant increases in heat waves over the past 40 years, according to new research. Scientists found that prolonged periods of extremely hot days have significantly increased in over 200 urban areas across the globe between 1973 and 2012. And they say that heat waves have been most prominent in the most recent years on record. Researchers from the US and India studied 200 urban areas across the globe from 1973 to 2012. They found that extremely hot days (stock image of a heat wave in New York in 2008 shown) have increased across the globe. And 2009 to 2012 were the top four years containing heat waves . The research was published today in the Institute of Physics Publishing's journal Environmental Research Letters . It was undertaken by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (ITTGN), Northeastern University, University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Washington. The study is one of the first to focus solely on the extent of extreme weather on a global scale, as well as examining disparities between urban and non-urban areas. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report was published in November. It said continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes. This will increase the likelihood of 'severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.' Such impacts include extreme weather and rising sea levels, heat waves, flooding and droughts. Ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life. Without changes in emissions, 'climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century.' At the current rate, by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2°C (3.6°F) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. By the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer. The impact on the Earth could already be considered dangerous, the report claimed. The researchers obtained daily observations for rain, air temperature and wind speed from data produced by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Heat waves were defined as periods where the daily maximum temperature was hotter than 99 per cent of days for the period 1973 to 2012, for a consecutive period of six or more days. The results showed that there were statistically significant increases in the number of heat waves per urban areas during the last four decades. Of the five years with the largest number of heat waves, four were the most recent years on record (2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012). Results also showed a general decline in cold waves, and around 60 per cent of urban areas experienced a significant decline in extreme windy days. Around 17 per cent of urban areas experienced a significant increase in daily precipitation extremes, and around 10 per cent experienced a significant increase in annual maximum precipitation. Lead author of the research Professor Vimal Mishra from IIT Gandhinagar said: 'Our results show significant increases in heat waves and the number of hot days and warm nights, and at the same time declines in cold waves and extreme windy days in many urban areas over the last 40 years.' According to the IPCC report in November, global warming  is impacting 'all continents and across the oceans'. This map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents . This map from the latest study shows the changes in the number of extreme hot days per year, and gives an idea of where the heatwaves have been occurring. Hollow red dots show increases, solid red dots show significant increases. Hollow blue dots show decreases, solid blue dots show significant decreases . He continued: 'Over half of the world's population now live in urban areas; hence, it is particularly important to understand how the climate and climate extremes, in particular, are changing in these areas. 'Urban areas make up a relatively small part of the global land area; however, they are the centre of wealth, so damage to urban infrastructure could result in potentially large economic losses. 'Surprisingly, there have been few studies that have focused on changes in climatic extremes in these areas.' The team are now examining the impacts of climate and weather extremes in urban regions on critical lifeline infrastructures, as well as on urban and coastal ecosystems and marine life.","Researchers from the US and India studied 200 urban areas across the globe from 1973 to 2012 .
They found that extremely hot days have increased across the globe .
And 2009 to 2012 were the top four years containing heat waves .

"A baby pygmy goat was beheaded and another goat was taken from the New Orleans park where they had been penned up, the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said Thursday. The SPCA is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction in the death of Jack, a black-and-white pygmy goat, and the disappearance of his brother, a goat named Calvin. Both were born Nov. 6. 'It could have been a dog or coyote. It looks bad but I'd prefer to think that something like that happened,' said Morgana King, owner of 'Y'Herd Me?' which contracts out its goats to eat unwanted vegetation such as weeds, and to trim grass. The SPCA is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction in the death of Jack, a black-and-white pygmy goat, and the disappearance of his brother, a goat named Calvin . She acknowledged, however, that the wound looked like a cut rather than a bite. The dead goat's head was missing but its body was found Thursday at Brechtel Park on New Orleans' west bank. Four goats, including another kid born in September, had been penned there, according to the business website. King's husband, Michael King, told investigators the culprits might be teenagers he argued with because they were trying to 'mess with the goats' during the weekend, SPCA spokeswoman Alicia Haefele said. The dead goat's head (not pictured) was missing but its body was found Thursday at Brechtel Park on New Orleans' west bank . However, Morgana King said she believes that scenario was unlikely. 'He (Michael King) also believes that it was possibly an animal attack but our humane officers don't feel the wound marks on the neck support that scenario,' Haefele wrote in an email.","The SPCA is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction in the death of Jack, a black-and-white pygmy goat, and the disappearance of his brother, a goat named Calvin .

Chinese buyers splurged more than $12 billion in 2013-14, a massive increase from the comparatively paltry $5.9 billion it coughed up the year before, according to Fairfax Media. Scroll down for video . Mount Eliza's Palladian palace, Palazzina, sold to a Chinese buyer for $4.5 million . The money was predominantly spent on new homes, with $16.4 billion spent on off-the-plan properties, compared to $5.73 billion the year before. Chief executive Gifang.com, a Chinese property website, Michael Yang said Australia's economy and top schools attracted foreign buyers. Mr Yang said Australia is seen as 'a safe place to invest' by overseas buyers. Chinese buyers truly dominated the market, spending more than twice as much as the second-place country, the United States, and third-place, Singapore. Foreign investment in Australia's property market tripled last year, as prices continued to skyrocket, new figures show . A Melbourne penthouse apartment in the Australia 108 complex that boasts 360 degree views of the city has been sold for $25 million to a Chinese businessman . Mount Eliza's Palladian palace, Palazzina, was one of the high-priced homes recently snapped up by an overseas buyer. The coastal mansion is set on 0.8 hectares of landscaped gardens, has 12 main rooms including a library, a study and conference or sports room . It had been listed in late 2013, and sold earlier this year to Chinese buyers. The landmark mansion was last sold $3.75 million in 2007 by the German businessman Joachim Mueller to former cosmetics company boss Rudi Miklosvary and his wife, Ilona. The design of the 2001-built property  was inspired by the Palladian style of architecture of 17th century Italy. Set on 0.8 hectares of landscaped gardens, Palazzina has 12 main rooms including a library, study and conference or sports room. Last month, a Chinese businessman bought Australia's most luxurious penthouse in the yet-to-be-built 108 Australia building that will be the tallest apartment building in the southern hemisphere. The Melbourne apartment, which is spread across the entire 100th floor of a super skyscraper and boasts 360 degree veiws over the city, is the most expensive single apartment sold in the country at $25million. The luxury mansion Villa del Mare at Point Piper in Sydney was bought last year by a Hong Kong investor for $39million, although Treasurer Joe Hockey has ordered the investor to sell it immediately after deciding the purchase breached foreign ownership rules. Current rules for foreign buyers state they are permitted to buy new homes, provided their bid is back by the FIRB. Yet, foreign spend on existing homes still rose from $2 billion to $7.17 billion during the last financial year. The current rules allow temporary residents to buy one established home to live in, under the condition they sell it when it no longer is their residence. The Federal Government has proposed crack downs on foreign investors, with new tough new regulations being discussed, which would include forcing international buyers to fork out high application fees for each attempt at buying property.

"A Muslim hardliner who says adulterers should be stoned to death and that gay men and fornicators should be lashed 100 times has set up an Islamic school that has received almost £1million of taxpayers’ money. Ibrahim Hewitt, one of Britain’s most prominent Islamic firebrands – who also heads a charity branded a ‘terrorist’ organisation by the US – is the founder and chairman of trustees of the Al-Aqsa school in Leicester, which teaches 250 boys and girls aged between three and 11. He has vilified homosexuals as paedophiles and said a man can take on a second wife if his first fails to satisfy him sexually. Mr Hewitt has published his views in a book on Islam, which he claims has sold more than 50,000 copies in Britain. A teacher at the Al Aqsa primary school in Leicester . The preacher is the founder of another . controversial organisation called the Association of Muslim Schools . (AMS), whose leader has been accused of orchestrating a plot in . Birmingham called ‘Operation Trojan Horse’ in which Islamic extremists . have allegedly taken over 25 state schools in the city. Last . night it was reported that six Birmingham, schools implicated in the . plot will be placed in ‘special measures’ by inspectors, meaning their . leadership team could be removed. Ofsted is also said to be taking . action at a further nine schools where the attempted takeover is less . advanced. That news came as . campaigners called for an investigation by the Department for Education . (DfE) to be expanded to Mr Hewitt and his Leicester school. Douglas . Murray, of anti-extremist think-tank the Henry Jackson Society, said: . ‘I would like to see the investigation widened to other cities as well . as Birmingham, and maybe look at private schools in case the welfare of . children is at risk. ‘There should be an investigation into Al-Aqsa to see what children are being taught.’ Ibrahim Hewitt, chairman of Al-Aqsa school said that all adulterers should be stoned to death and fornication should be punished with 100 lashes . Mr . Hewitt, 57, established the private school in 1998. He runs it with his . wife Adeba, 53. The school practises segregated seating for boys and . girls from aged seven and does not allow music or dance lessons as they . are deemed un-Islamic. Female teachers teach with their faces  covered . with a veil, according to images on the school’s website. The . school, which charges fees of up to £1,800 per year, has received . £747,360 from the Local Education Authority in Leicester as an early . years grant for teaching three to five-year-olds since 2007. The . preacher is the author of a book called What Does Islam Say?, which . spells out his vision of ‘true Islam’. In it he advocates the killing of . adulterers by stoning. The book says: ‘Any act that destabilises . marriage will also destabilise society. Hence the Islamic punishments . for such acts are severe… Married men and women found guilty of adultery . are to be stoned to death.’ The . book also advocates 100 lashes for fornication and sodomy with both men . and women, and condemns homosexuality as a ‘grave sin’. Mr . Hewitt says in the book: ‘Islam, like most other major faiths of the . world, categorically forbids homosexual practices (sexual relations . between two men or between two women), regarding them as a great sin. In . a society under Islamic law, such would be severely punished.’ He . then compares homosexuals to paedophiles or those who commit incest. The book says: ‘If people have such desires [homosexuality], they should . keep them to themselves, and control their desires to avoid forbidden . practices. ‘The advice . would be the same as, say, to someone who had sexual desires for minors . or for close  family: that having the desires does not legitimise . realising them.’ The book . also argues that men and women are not equal, and men have a right to . assume leadership over women. ‘Islam recognises the leadership of men . over women, but it does not recognise the domination of one over the . other.’ He adds: ‘If a woman . is unable to satisfy the sexual or other needs of her husband he may . consider taking another wife, rather than the common Western practice of . secretly taking a mistress.’ Mr . Hewitt has in the past said that ‘political Zionism is a threat to . world peace’ and has objected to the setting up of Holocaust Memorial . Day. He is also the . chairman of a  charity called Interpal, which the US Treasury has . designated a  ‘global terrorist entity’ due to accusations it has raised . money for the Palestinian terror group Hamas. However, a report by the . UK Charity Commission last year found no evidence that it had done so. When . The Mail on Sunday contacted Mr Hewitt, he said he still ‘endorses’ what he wrote in the book. ‘Islamic law states that homosexuals should . be lashed and adulterers should be stoned. I believe that is correct if . it is an Islamic state. I am a Muslim and if I lived in an Islamic state . then I would live by what I wrote in my book. But I am in this country . and follow its law,’ he said. Education . Secretary Michael Gove has appointed the Met’s former counter-terrorism . chief, Peter Clarke, to head an investigation into the alleged Trojan . Horse plot. By BEN ELLERY . A state-funded Islamic school was at the centre of controversy last night over claims that a poster banning listening to music appeared on its official noticeboard. The poster, alleged to have been put up  at the Madani Schools Federation in Leicester, warned that pupils ‘must stay away from evil acts such as music and encourage others to do the same too’. A photo of the poster, which is claimed to have been taken by a concerned supply teacher inside the school, has appeared on Facebook. A Facebook post branding music as 'sinful' is being investigated by council chiefs in Leicester . The poster’s text quoted an apparent saying of the Prophet Mohammed, which said: ‘Music sows hypocrisy in the heart like water causes seeds to grow in soil.’ It also warned: ‘Music is a tool of Shaytan [Satan]’, adding: ‘The messages of today’s music follow a general theme of love, drugs and freedom.’ Leicester assistant mayor Vi Dempster said: ‘Council officers will be visiting the school after Easter to discuss the issue with the headteacher and governors.’ Madani, a faith academy once accused  of flouting the Equalities Act by insisting boys and girls were segregated and taught by a member of the same sex, has received £18 million of state funding. Its chairman of governors, Hussein Suleman, said: ‘This poster has not existed in our premises.  I don’t know who dreamt this hoax up.’ Inayat Bunglawala of Muslims4UK, a group set up to promote Muslim engagement with British society, said music prohibitions in the Islamic faith related to some disputed sayings attributed to Prophet Mohammed after his death, adding: ‘It would be bizarre if a state-funded school would not give music its due importance in the curriculum.’ The supply teacher said to have taken  the photo declined to comment.","Fees at the school where boys and girls are segregated are £1,800 .

"Texas death row inmate Robert Ladd man was executed this evening for the killing a 38-year-old woman nearly two decades ago while he was on parole for a triple slaying years earlier. Robert Ladd, 57, received a lethal injection after the US Supreme Court rejected arguments he was mentally impaired and ineligible for the death penalty. The court also rejected an appeal in which Ladd's attorney challenged whether the pentobarbital Texas uses in executions is potent enough to not cause unconstitutional pain and suffering. Ladd was put to death for the 1996 slaying of Vicki Ann Garner, of Tyler, who was strangled and beaten with a hammer. Her arms and legs were bound, bedding was placed between her legs, and she was set on fire in her apartment. Put to death: Robert Ladd (left), 57, was put to death by lethal injection Thursday for the 1996 slaying of 38-year-old Vickie Ann Garner (right) Ladd's lawyers have said they found juvenile records suggesting he was mentally impaired, but the US Supreme Court rejected the argument that he was ineligible for the death penalty . In his final statement, Ladd addressed the sister of his victim by name, telling her he was 'really, really sorry.' 'I really, really hope and pray you don't have hatred in your heart,' he said, adding that he didn't think she could have closure but hoped she could find peace. 'A revenge death won't get you anything,' he said. Then Ladd told the warden: 'Let's ride.' As the drug took effect, he said: 'Stings my arm, man!' He began taking deep breaths, then started snoring. His snores became breaths, each one becoming less pronounced, before he stopped all movement. Savage: Garner, pictured in this undated photo with her family, was strangled and beaten with a hammer. Her arms and legs were bound, bedding was placed between her legs, and she was set on fire in her apartment . Vicki Garner was killed by Ladd while he was on parole . Garner's sister said their family have waited 18 long years to see justice done . He was pronounced dead at 7.02pm, 27 minutes after the drug was administered. Teresa Garner Wooten, Vicki's sister who was on hand Thursday to watch Ladd put to death, told CBS19 on the eve of the execution that it has been a long time coming. 'I did not think, 18-plus years ago, that I would still be fighting for justice for her,' Mrs Wooten said, adding that she had forgiven her sister's killer. Ladd came within hours of lethal injection in 2003 before a federal court agreed to hear evidence about juvenile records that suggested he was mentally impaired. Ladd and fellow death row inmate Garcia Glenn White (pictured) were plaintiffs in a lawsuit that seeks a federal court order to block Texas prison officials from carrying out executions until the 'quality and viability' of pentobarbital can be examined and verified . That appeal was denied and the Supreme Court last year turned down a review of Ladd's case. His attorneys renewed similar arguments as his new execution date approached. 'Ladd's deficits are well documented, debilitating and significant,' Brian Stull, a senior staff lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union Capital Punishment Project, told the high court. In a press release sent out immediately after Ladd's execution, Stull said that his death 'is yet another example of how capital punishment routinely defies the rule of law and human decency.' Kelli Weaver, a Texas attorney general, reminded the justices in a filing that 'each court that has reviewed Ladd's claim has determined that Ladd is not intellectually disabled.' Ladd's lawyers cited a psychiatrist's determination in 1970 that Ladd, then a 13-year-old in custody of the Texas Youth Commission, had an IQ of 67. Courts have embraced scientific studies that consider an IQ of 70 a threshold for impairment. The inmate's attorneys also contended he long has had difficulties with social skills and functioning on his own. Ladd also was a plaintiff in a lawsuit questioning the 'quality and viability' of Texas' supply of its execution drug, pentobarbital. The Texas Attorney General's Office called the challenge 'nothing more than rank speculation.' When he was arrested for Garner's slaying, Ladd had been on parole for about four years after serving about a third of a 40-year prison term for the slayings of a Dallas woman and her two children. He pleaded guilty to those crimes.","Robert Ladd, 57, received lethal injection and was pronounced dead at 7.02pm, 27 minutes after the drug pentobarbital was administered .

"The new Greek government has picked its first fight with the European Union, delaying agreement on further EU sanctions against Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. The move raised European and Nato fears that Moscow might seek to exploit the extremist coalition under Alexis Tsipras as a Trojan horse within the key western alliances. An emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers was convened in Brussels to respond to the upsurge in violence in eastern Ukraine, notably last week's shelling of the town of Mariupol by pro-Russian secessionists which left 30 civilians dead and 100 wounded. The move raised European and Nato fears that Moscow might seek to exploit the extremist coalition under Alexis Tsipras (pictured) as a Trojan horse within the key western alliances . Last night the ministers agreed to prolong the blacklisting of pro-Russian separatist leaders from March until September, to add new names to the blacklist by next week, and asked the European commission to look into broadening the economic and financial sanctions against Russia imposed last July. Although it was originally feared that the Greeks would veto the sanctions, their ambassador merely prolonged the blacklisting by refusing to agree to the key passage on sanctions, until his minister arrived in Brussels. 'One delegation has a general reserve on the text,' the ambassadors stated in the final draft of the document. Although several other countries are lukewarm about renewing or extending sanctions against Moscow or the Russian separatists, diplomats said there were no other dissenters on the statement, which squarely held Russia to blame for facilitating the Mariupol attack. The meeting 'notes evidence of continued and growing support given to the separatists by Russia, which underlines Russia's responsibility,' the statement said. Nikos Kotzias (pictured), the new Greek foreign minister, said Greece wanted to 'prevent a rift' between Russia and the EU . While falling short of proposing new sanctions on Russia, the statement told the European commission to prepare new 'appropriate action'. Diplomats said that meant broader financial and economic penalties against Moscow than those imposed last July and which need to be renewed by this July. Britain is pushing for stronger sanctions against Moscow. Nikos Kotzias, the new Greek foreign minister, said Greece wanted to 'prevent a rift' between Russia and the EU, although both sides have been in acute conflict for the past 10 months over Moscow's assault on Ukraine. Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy coordinator chairing the meeting, said the decision to augment the sanctions was unanimous. She said Kotzias was 'taking his own position which was changing in the days'.","Greek ambassador refused more sanctions against Russian backed rebels .

"Marion 'Suge' Knight is being questioned over the alleged murder of a friend today after turning himself into police in the early hours of this morning. The hip hop mogul was named as a wanted man after he was  involved in a fatal hit-and-run incident in California that left one man dead and another injured. Police believe Knight and some other men were involved in an argument on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton on Thursday afternoon. When the men went to lunch at Tam's Burger's in Compton 20 minutes later, Knight, 49, is believed to have followed the men in his red pickup truck. The incident ended with him reversing over one man and hitting another. Both were friends of Knight and police named the dead man as Terry Carter, 55. The injured man is actor Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan, 51. Scroll down for video . Suge Knight (center) hands himself in to police in West Hollywood early Friday morning following his alleged involvement in a deadly hit-and-run in Compton, California, on Thursday afternoon. Police attend the scene in Compton which left 55-year-old Terry Carter died and Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan, 51, was injured. They were hit in the parking lot of Tam's Burger's (pictured) by Knight's pick-up truck . Knight smiled (right) and puffed on a cigar (left) as turned himself into the West Hollywood Sheriff's station . Mr Carter, a businessman, was a married father of two daughters. He lived with his wife Lillian, 55, near Inglewood, in Los Angeles. Mrs Carter was said to be 'devastated'. A family spokesman said: 'We are just trying to get through the next few hours. This is a very emotional time for us all.' Knight's lawyer said his client 'accidentally' hit the men but the incident is being treated as a homicide by police. Knight was declared to be wanted on suspicion of murder by police in Los Angeles on Thursday afternoon. A bulletin issued to all police in California said he should be considered armed and dangerous, TMZ reported. Around 3am this morning he was  seen arriving at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department West Hollywood station with his attorney, James Blatt. Homicide detectives interviewed the Death Row Records founder for about three hours, the Los Angeles Times reported. Detectives formally 'arrested Marion 'Suge' Knight for murder'. Bail was set at $2million bail, according to a police statement. Blatt admitted Knight was driving the truck but said he was 'confident that once the investigation is completed, he will be totally exonerated'. 'He was in the process of being physically assaulted by two men and in an effort to escape he unfortunately hit two (other) individuals. 'He was in his car trying to escape.' Blatt said the dead man was Knight's friend, 55-year-old Terry Carter. The second victim, actor Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan, 51, was not seriously hurt, ABC 7 Los Angeles reported. Lt. John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detective's unit said: . 'Looks like he drove backwards and struck the victims and drove forwards and struck them again. 'The people we talked to say it looked like it was an intentional act. 'They obviously knew each other. 'They got into some kind of verbal altercation and it escalated.' Robert Smith, 17, who witnessed the argument said. 'To see the argument happen, it's one thing.' 'Seeing the car incident, that was shocking.' Knight's empty truck was found late Thursday night in a West Los Angeles parking lot. Authorities believe Knight was driving this truck yesterday. It was found  in a West Los Angeles parking lot . Knight, the dead man, and the injured actor were all friends. Sloan and Knight had both been on the set of Straight Outta Compton before the argument. The documentary is a bio-pic being made of the group N.W.A., which included Ice Cube -  the dead man's business partner - and Dr Dre. Neither were on set yesterday. The injured man, Sloan, is a former gangster who has dedicated his life subsequently to filmmaking and anti-gang activities. He was born in Los Angeles and is known for his work on Training Day, End of Watch and Brooklyn's Finest, according to his biography on IMDB. The actor, who was featured in Eve's Gangsta Lovin' music video and served as a technical advisor for television shows Southland and Sons Of Anarchy, is a former member of the Los Angeles Bloods street gang. He also directed an HBO documentary, Bastards of the Party, which examined the history of gangs in Los Angeles. 'I've put in a lot of work. I mean, unfortunately my hands got a lot of blood on them, you know, what I mean?' Sloan told National Public Radio. 'And so people still look at me, you know, with that persona. 'So you see me on the block, you see me having some, you know, some success and it stimulates, you know, a dialogue between me and the homies - knowing that, you know, I'm a filmmaker and I am a Blood.' The incident occurred in the parking lot of the fast-food joint yesterday (above) and Knight was charged with murder after turning himself in early on Friday morning . This is  just the most recent in a string of legal problems and police run-ins for Knight. He was shot six times in August at a Los Angeles nightclub at a party hosted by Chris Brown. Two other people - a  man and a woman - were shot at the pre-MTV Video Music Awards party. 1987: Knight was arrested for domestic violence, allegedly stealing a car, carrying a concealed weapon and attempted murder. 1990: Knight pleaded guilty to two battery charges. 1991: Rumor has it Knight held Vanilla Ice over a balcony to get him to sign over his publishing rights - which he reportedly did. 1992: Charged with assault and battery. 1996: Knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with rapper Tupac Shakur at a Las Vegas, Nevada, hotel. The beating came shortly before Shakur suffered fatal gunshot wounds. 1997: Linked to death of Notorious B.I.G. 2002: Knight was jailed for violating his probation by associating with gang members in Los Angeles. 2003: He went back to jail on a parole violation after punching a parking lot attendant outside a Hollywood nightclub. 2005: Knight was shot in the leg during an MTV Video Music Awards pre-party in Miami. No arrests were made. 2006: Death Row Records filed for bankruptcy, and a Los Angeles judge ordered a trustee to take it over because of gross mismanagement. 2009: Knight was hospitalized for treatment of facial injuries following a fight at a hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona.2013: The rap music figure was arrested on an outstanding warrant and later released after being pulled over for a traffic violation in Los Angeles. 2014: Ahead of the MTV Video Music Awards, Knight was shot six times during an altercation at a Hollywood nightclub at a party hosted by Chris Brown. 2014: Katt Williams and Knight were accused of stealing a camera from a photographer. He pleaded not guilty after being charged with robbery and could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted. 2015: Knight was arrested on suspicion of murder in a hit-and-run wreck that killed a man and injured another. After he was shot, Knight reportedly calmly walked outside and asked a cop for help before he was rushed to hospital. A source told the New York Post: 'It was organised chaos, Suge was shot right after talking to Chris Brown. 'Suge was talking to Brown who was on a podium. 'They seemed to be having a friendly conversation that lasted a few minutes. About 30 seconds later shots rang out and Suge was hit. 'The shooter definitely wasn't aiming for Chris, because he was right there, stood above everyone, front and center.' No arrests were made in connection with the shooting. Following Knight's release from the hospital, he and comedian Katt Williams were arrested in October and charged with felony robbery for allegedly stealing a camera from a woman who was taking photos of the two. The actual incident took place on September 5, just over a week after Knight had been shot. He had been scheduled to appear in court this week after pleading not guilty in that case and being set free on $500,000 bail. In 1996 he was driving with his friend Tupac Shakur when the rapper was shot and killed in the passenger seat, a case that to this day remains unsolved. In 1997 he was sentenced to nine years in prison after being convicted in an assault case, and was released in 2001. He was sent back two years later for violating his parole - after he hit a parking attendant. Some believe Knight was behind the 1997 killing of rap star Christopher Wallace, best known as Biggie Smalls or Notorious B.I.G. In his book Murder Rap, former Los Angeles Police Department Detective Greg Kading wrote that Knight supplied money to an associate in exchange for killings Smalls. Police have made no arrests in the case. Knight's name has also famously been linked to 90s rapper Vanilla Ice, aka Robert  Van Winkle. According to hip hop lore, Knight held the Ice Ice Baby star over a balcony to convince him to sign over his publishing rights. The legend also holds that Knight then used the money to start Death Row Records. The record company is now defunct. Lt. John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detective's unit (above) said that Knight and and Carter and Sloan 'clearly knew each other' Van Winkle partially denied the story during an interview with Interview Magazine: . 'That's a lie. 'I read the story, and I heard it, and I had to defend it nine million times, but he never took me to the balcony, threatened to hang me over, or anything. 'I did go to a balcony, so there is a little bit of truth to it. 'Yes, Suge Knight took some money from me, and he did take me to the balcony, explained it to me. 'He was actually nice to me. 'I look at it like I've invested in some of the greatest hip-hop music in the world. I mean, from the money that Suge got from To the Extreme [Vanilla Ice album] from me, he started Dr. Dre. 'The Chronic record came from the funding from my record; Tupac came from the funding of my record; Snoop Dogg came from the funding from my record.'","Suge Knight allegedly 'ran over and killed' Terry Carter, 55, on Thursday afternoon in the parking lot of a burger restaurant .

"The Ministry of Justice said 'all necessary steps' were being taking to protect those potentially put at risk, including the officer who shot Mark Duggan . Firearms officers and jurors have been put at risk after two computer discs containing sensitive information about them were lost in the post. The officer who shot Mark Duggan – whose killing sparked the London riots – is among those in danger of being identified following the astonishing blunder by Whitehall officials. Security has been urgently overhauled, with police marksmen given extra protection in case of revenge attacks. It is the most serious data breach since 2007 when two HM Revenue & Customs discs containing information on 25million people were lost in the post. The latest details to go missing relate to the killings of Duggan, Azelle Rodney and Robert Hamill. The Ministry of Justice refused to discuss the nature of the lost data. But it said ‘all necessary steps’ had been taken to ensure all those potentially placed at risk were protected. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has ordered an investigation into the ‘appalling’ breach to discover exactly how the data vanished. Ministers said they were treating the incident ‘extremely seriously’ and lawyers are working frantically to establish exactly what information was stored in documents on the discs. Two of the investigations relate to the fatal police shootings of crime suspects in London – an inquest into the death of Duggan in 2011 and an inquiry into the death of Rodney in 2005. The third is an inquest into the 1997 murder of Mr Hamill by Loyalists in Northern Ireland, which campaigners claim involved the collusion of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Officials realised the discs, containing thousands of pages of information, were missing on January 8. One member of staff has been suspended over the blunder. Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan said yesterday: ‘This is an appalling lapse in security concerning highly confidential information on very sensitive investigations. 'It would be disastrous if this data got into the wrong hands.’ The Ministry of Justice said: ‘There is no evidence to indicate the information loss arose from malicious intent. Also on the disks, which ministers realised were missing on January 8, are details of the inquiry into the shooting of Azelle Rodney (left) in 2005, and the 1997 murder of Mark Hamill in Northern Ireland (right) 'Nevertheless, it is essential to take all necessary steps to safeguard the interests of anyone whose information could be disclosed.’ The Metropolitan Police said it had performed a risk assessment and had taken ‘appropriate steps’. The loss is particularly sensitive as Duggan’s shooting by police led to the August 2011 riots in London – which spread across England causing five deaths and £200million of damage. The 29-year-old, who was in the feared Tottenham Man Dem gang, is said to have brandished a firearm at officers who stopped him in north London. He then ran off and was shot twice, dying from a gunshot wound to the chest. Police were cleared of killing him unlawfully despite the father-of-four being unarmed at the time.The firearms officer who shot Duggan was given anonymity when he gave evidence to an inquest, and was known only as V53. Rodney was shot dead in north London in 2005 in a swoop by officers who thought he and two other men were going to stage an armed heist on Colombian drug dealers . An inquiry found there was ‘no lawful justification’ for killing the 24-year-old. All but one of the officers involved in the shooting have been granted anonymity. Father-of-three Mr Hamill, a 25-year-old Catholic, died after being beaten by a Loyalist gang in Portadown, County Armagh, in 1997. An inquiry was launched amid allegations four officers were positioned in a police vehicle near the scene of the attack but did not intervene. Its report has not yet been published. His family said in a statement: ‘We are asking our solicitor to seek an urgent meeting with government officials to seek answers to our concerns about this serious breach of data protection.’ Deborah Coles, of the charity Inquest, said: ‘This is an astonishing and unacceptable lapse that will further undermine public and family confidence in the way contentious deaths are dealt with. 'It is shocking that such sensitive material can be treated with such apparent disregard, particularly considering the strict confidentiality undertakings families and their lawyers have to sign up to.’ Data watchdog the Information Commissioner is examining the case. One victim described being targeted by a convicted abuser after Labour MP Keith Vaz outed four people who had been abused as children online . Child abuse victims say they have received death threats after senior Labour MP Keith Vaz published their names on a parliamentary website. The former Europe Minister was accused of an error of judgment after releasing emails containing the identities of four people abused in childhood and unfavourable comments about them. The row is the latest to engulf the independent child sex abuse inquiry, which has faltered amid complaints about a lack of transparency and the backgrounds of some inquiry panel members. Victims hit out at the decision by Mr Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, to post un-redacted emails about them on its website. In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, they said the blunder ‘highlighted an astonishing lack of awareness’. Signed by the four ‘outed’ victims and 14 others who have been campaigning for changes to the inquiry, the letter said those who were named had ‘been subjected to social media hate campaigns as a result of the disclosures and negative attitudes expressed by some panel members’. It added: ‘[One victim] and his young daughter have been targeted by [a] convicted abuser.’ Mrs May wrote to Mr Vaz to express her ‘dismay’. The anonymity of sex abuse victims is protected by the Sexual Offences (Amendment Act) 1992. Home Affairs Select Committee sources defended Mr Vaz, saying those he named had previously publicly declared themselves, one way or another, as abuse victims. Despite this, he was reported last night to be in the process of apologising to the four. Lucy Duckworth of the Survivors Alliance told The Guardian: ‘Since this information was published the individuals have received death threats.’ The Home Affairs Select Committee said the material had since been redacted to remove references to the victims. Mrs May is due to announce a new chairman for the inquiry. The two previously selected, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss and Fiona Woolf, had to resign over their connections to the Establishment.","Officials first realised two computer disks were missing on January 8 .

"A top policeman who was accused of whistle blowing after he had his home and office bugged by colleagues has told how he's been left him 'humiliated' by an investigation into the scandal. NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Nick Kaldas told a parliamentary inquiry he has been punished for speaking out, including being passed over for promotion, while attacking the way the NSW Ombudsman has handled a two-year investigation into the bugging scandal that reaches to the highest levels of the NSW Police Force. Mr Kaldas, who has hunted murderers, worked in warzones and faced death threats from terrorists, has revealed there is no one he fears more than NSW Ombudsman Bruce Barbour. The parliamentary inquiry is the final stage of Operation Prospect, an investigation which begun two years ago by the NSW Ombudsman, using royal commission-style powers to investigate two controversial operations, Mascot and Florida, mounted by the police Special Crime and Internal Affairs unit in 2000. Scroll down for video . Man of integrity: One of the country's most distinguished police officers, NSW deputy commissioner Nick Kaldas (pictured) has worked in Iraq, locked up murderers and trained with the FBI, but his stellar career has been dogged by an illegal bugging operation commandeered in 2000 by his rival for the top job . During Operations Mascot and Florida, Mr Kaldas was among more than 100 officers named on phone tap warrants allegedly obtained by officers using false or misleading evidence to judges. He became the target of a surveillance operation overseen by the current Police Commissioner, Andrew Scipione and run by his now fellow deputy, Catherine Burn. 'I received many threats from Hezbollah and other proxy groups,' Mr Kaldas told the Upper House inquiry in Sydney on Friday, referring to his work advising coalition police forces in Iraq and leading a United Nations investigation into the 2005 assassination of Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri. 'I fear no man and I have operated in trusted circles with the top secret level of clearance from our national government and our allies. 'Yet I have never been denigrated, humiliated and had my every action and thought so unreasonably maligned as I experienced during Operation Prospect.' The rival: Deputy police commissioner Kath Burn has denied she illegally bugged police or enacted listening device warrants against fellow deputy commissioner Nick Kaldas as 'part of a personal vendetta'. Both senior officers are seen as candidates for the next NSW police commissioner . Man the middle: Current NSW police commissioner Andrew Scipione was the boss of the internal affairs unit that bugged the phones of 114 police and others in what is now being investigated as an illegal phone tapping scandal that threatens to tarnish Scipione's administration and end his deputy Kath Burn's career . Mr Kaldas told the inquiry he was targeted by officers in SCIA with whom he was in conflict, stemming, among other things, from complaints he made about them plagiarising a report he wrote on covert policing. The early 2000 Mascot investigation found nothing but harmed his life, his family and his career, he said. His mobile phone and his office as head of the homicide squad were bugged, as was the home of his ex-wife and children, and he was passed over for promotions. Current NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione was head of SCIA at the time Operation Mascot and Operation Florida were conducted, and current Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn was the SCIA officer in charge of the operations. Ms Burn, who has denied any wrongdoing in a statement, also appeared before the state parliamentary inquiry on Friday afternoon. Mr Kaldas said Operation Prospect had sided with the officers being complained about and targeted him and other victims. From child immigrant to 2IC: Nick Kaldas came from Egypt to Australia aged twelve, named 'Naguib' and was fluent in English, French and Arabic. He has risen through the ranks of the NSW Police Force as a hostage negotiator, homicide squad chief, counter terrorism expert, special adviser to Iraq and now a contender for  next commissioner . Softly spoken: Well-liked and a skilful and respected operator, deputy police commissioner Nick Kaldas (pictured) has a softly spoken manner which belies his incisive approach to tackling crime. After training police in Iraq, Kaldas returned to warn that Australia was 'not in isolation' and could be targeted by terrorists . After making complaints about the bugging, he was called down for a 'friendly' hearing with the Ombudsman last September but instead faced a day-long attack on his credibility. 'It felt to me this was a well-planned attack to silence me as one of the main complainants,' he said. 'The Ombudsman has now summoned me again to appear before him and I hold fears of his intentions towards me.' He told the inquiry: 'Yet again my privacy has been utterly invaded with operation prospect where my diaries, my notebooks, my emails my phone records have all been seised by the Ombudsman and yet again the justification for this invasion of privacy is completely out of proportion to what is alleged.' Veteran journalist Neil Mercer, who has written extensively about operations Mascot and Florida, appeared before the inquiry and testified that SCIA officers had condoned a criminal informant giving perjured evidence in court. Uncertainty: Commissioner Andrew Scipione (above) may be affected by the inquiry into the secret bugging operation he oversaw . Mr Mercer also revealed that he had been called before the ombudsman in 2014 and was asked - with the agreement of his source - to reveal where he obtained documents relating to Operation Mascot. Mr Kaldas, an Arabic speaking counter terrorism expert who is an FBI trained hostage negotiator, has worked the netherworld of the undercover cop and been on the ground in Iraq training a police force to operate after the downfall of Saddam Hussein. He has an outwardly gentle manner which belies his hard headed approach to tackling crime. As one of the most experienced police officers in Australia he found himself a victim at the centre of the bugging scandal which threatens to engulf the hierarchy of the nation's oldest and largest police force. Kaldas, 57, is touted as a leading candidate to take over the top job as NSW police commissioner. He appeared at the parliamentary inquiry to give evidence of 'massive wrongdoing and habitual illegal acts' committed during the bugging operation by senior officers. He has equal ranking with deputy commissioner Catherine Burn, the officer who is accused of bugging 114 people, including police officers, civilians and a journalist. Ms Burn was the senior officer who briefed NSW politicians in the wake of the December siege on the Lindt cafe. Mr Kaldas is expected to say illegal acts committed during an internal police affairs investigation called Operation Mascot were 'sanctioned and covered up' by the Police Integrity Commission and NSW Crime Commission. He is the most high profile police officer placed under covert surveillance by the operation, which aimed to bug allegedly corrupt police in the early 2000s. Voice of the siege: Kath Burn was the senior police officer who faced the media after briefing NSW politicians about the police operation in the Sydney siege. It has since been revealed that siege victim Katrina Dawson died when a fragment of a police bullet hit one of her arteries . His unquestioned integrity and wealth of experience fighting crime - he has been a commander of the NSW Gangs Squad and an assistant commissioner for counter terrorism, as well as being deployed by the Federal government to Iraq as a special police adviser - makes Mr Kaldas's evidence most damning. Catherine Burn put Operation Mascot into play the day before the opening of the Sydney Olympics, on September 14, 2000, when she allegedly swore a warrant for the Special Crimes and Internal Affairs unit (SCIA) before Sydney judge Virginia Bell. Almost half of the officers' names on the warrant were supposed to have attended a farewell function for a retiring police sergeant at a club on Sydney's north shore. The warrant was based on flawed information. Most of the officers had not attended the function which had been held three months earlier. When Fairfax news revealed the bugging operation in 2002, Ms Burn was ordered to report to the NSW police minister. Then police commissioner Peter Ryan dismissed the issue on national television, saying if he has been a guest at the police farewell, he too would have been bugged. The allegedly illegal bugging operation continued to surface in reports since, becoming part of an investigation called Strike Force Emblems and the crux of the NSW Upper House inquiry which opened on Thursday. On the ground: Nick Kaldas, pictured with then police minister John Watkins in 2006, warned on his return from Iraq that year that 'Australia is very much part of the international community and if something happens in Palestine or Iraq, we have to accept that it has an impact over here' In the lead up to the inquiry, Ms Burn has denied falsifying evidence in the warrant to Judge Bell to secretly bug police, or to 'use illegal warrants to secretly record conversations of my rivals in the police force'. She has specifically denied she directed use of illegal warrants to bug Mr Kaldas 'as part of a personal vendetta' when there was no suspicion of his wrongdoing. Kaldas, 57, is the son of Egyptian Christian parents who emigrated to Australia when he was 12 years old. He landed in western Sydney with the first name of Naguib, but he spoke fluent English and French. Kaldas also spoke Arabic at home and remained fluent in the language as he grew up, graduating from high school and later the NSW Police Academy, in 1981. He rose quickly through the ranks. Kaldas worked as an undercover detective and in the Homicide Squad investigating high profile murder cases. He completed a masters degree in public policy and administration at also the hostage negotiators course in 1996 at FBI headquarters in Quantico, Virginia. In 2004, was appointed chief of the NSW Crime Command's gangs squad. In the same year, he was seconded for the first time to Iraq, as Senior Police Adviser, National Operations, and later as Deputy Chief Police Adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority, and spent eight months training Iraqi police. On his return in 2006, when Kaldas was promoted to NSW Police assistant commissioner in charge of counter terrorism and public order management, he said a terrorist attack in Australia was likely. 'Australia is very much part of the international community and if something happens in Palestine or Iraq, we have to accept that it has an impact over here,' he said at the time. In 2009, Kaldas was seconded to the Hague for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon investigating the assassination of Rafic Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister who was blown up in a Beirut motorcade in 2005. Back in Australia, Kaldas was made one of NSW's two deputy police commissioners and has carried on with his distinguished career, all the while with an inquiry into the bugging operation looming closer.","Deputy police commissioner Nick Kaldas is giving evidence at an inquiry .

"The Earth's crust under Iceland is rising. A new study has found that as global warming melts the island's great ice caps, the crust is 'rebounding' and rising. Some sites in south-central Iceland are moving upward as much as 1.4 inches per year, the researchers concluded. Some sites in south-central Iceland are moving upward as much as 1.4 inches per year — a speed that surprised the researchers. Geologists have long known that as glaciers melt and become lighter, the Earth rebounds as the weight of the ice decreases. Whether the current rebound geologists detect is related to past deglaciation or modern ice loss has been an open question until now. Some sites in south-central Iceland are moving upward as much as 1.4 inches per year — a speed that surprised the researchers. The University of Arizona-led team reports in an upcoming issue of Geophysical Research Letters. The paper is the first to show the current fast uplift of the Icelandic crust is a result of accelerated melting of the island's glaciers and coincides with the onset of warming that began about 30 years ago, the scientists said. Some sites in south-central Iceland are moving upward as much as 1.4 inches per year — a speed that surprised the researchers. 'Our research makes the connection between recent accelerated uplift and the accelerated melting of the Icelandic ice caps,' said first author Kathleen Compton. Geologists have long known that as glaciers melt and become lighter, the Earth rebounds as the weight of the ice decreases. Whether the current rebound geologists detect is related to past deglaciation or modern ice loss has been an open question until now, said co-author Richard Bennett, a UA associate professor of geosciences. 'Iceland is the first place we can say accelerated uplift means accelerated ice mass loss,' Bennett said. To figure out how fast the crust was moving upward, the team used a network of 62 global positioning satellite receivers fastened to rocks throughout Iceland. By tracking the position of the GPS receivers year after year, the scientists 'watch' the rocks move and can calculate how far they have traveled — a technique called geodesy. The new work shows that, at least for Iceland, the land's current accelerating uplift is directly related to the thinning of glaciers and to global warming. 'What we're observing is a climatically induced change in the Earth's surface,' Bennett said. He added there is geological evidence that during the past deglaciation roughly 12,000 years ago, volcanic activity in some regions of Iceland increased thirtyfold. Others have estimated the Icelandic crust's rebound from warming-induced ice loss could increase the frequency of volcanic eruptions such as the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, which had negative economic consequences worldwide. Iceland's glaciers (white) are melting faster and faster. As a result, the Icelandic crust near the glaciers is rebounding at an accelerated rate, in some cases, as much as 1.4 inches per year, a UA-led team of geoscientists found. The researchers used Iceland's geodesy network of sensitive GPS receivers (red triangles) to determine how fast the land is rising. The article 'Climate driven vertical acceleration of Icelandic crust measured by CGPS geodesy' by Compton, Bennett and their co-author Sigrun Hreinsdóttir of GNS Science in Avalon, New Zealand, was accepted for publication Jan. 14, 2015, and is soon to be published online. The National Science Foundation and the Icelandic Center for Research funded the research. The team primarily used the geodesy network to track geological activity such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In 2013, Bennett noticed one of long-running stations in the centre of the country was showing that site was rebounding at an accelerated rate. He wondered about it, so he and his colleagues checked the nearby stations to see if they had recorded the same changes. This global positioning satellite receiver is part of Iceland's network of 62 receivers . To figure out how fast the crust was moving upward, the team used a network of 62 global positioning satellite receivers fastened to rocks throughout Iceland. By tracking the position of the GPS receivers year after year, the scientists 'watch' the rocks move and can calculate how far they have traveled — a technique called geodesy. Some of Iceland's GPS receivers have been in place since 1995. Bennett, Hreinsdóttir and colleagues had installed 20 GPS receivers in Iceland in 2006 and 2009, thus boosting the coverage of the nation's geodesy network. In central and southern Iceland, where five of the largest ice caps are located, the receivers are 18 miles or less apart on average. 'The striking answer was, yes, they all do,' he said. 'We wondered what in the world could be causing this?' The team began systematically analyzing years of signals from the entire network and found the fastest uplift was the region between several large ice caps. The rate of uplift slowed the farther the receiver was from the ice cap region. Other researchers had been measuring ice loss and observed a notable uptick in the rate of melting since 1995. Temperature records for Iceland, some of which go back to the 1800s, show temperatures increasing since 1980. To determine whether the same rate of ice loss year after year could cause such an acceleration in uplift, Compton tested that idea using mathematical models. The answer was no: The glaciers had to be melting faster and faster every year to be causing more and more uplift. Compton found the onset of rising temperatures and the loss of ice corresponded tightly with her estimates of when uplift began. 'I was surprised how well everything lined up,' she said. Bennett said, 'There's no way to explain that accelerated uplift unless the glacier is disappearing at an accelerated rate.' Estimating ice loss is laborious and difficult, he said. 'Our hope is we can use current GPS measurements of uplift to more easily quantify ice loss.' The team's next step is to analyze the uplift data to reveal the seasonal variation as the ice caps grow during the winter snow season and melt during the summer.","Researchers say the Earth's crust is 'rebounding' and rising .

"A Taliban detainee released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has been put under 'intensified' surveillance in Qatar after he allegedly made contact with members of the al Qaeda-linked Haqqani network and tried to join their ranks. The White House would not say today if the individual in question had actually contacted members of the Taliban as has been reported by news outlets and claimed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. It simply said that monitoring measures on that former detainee had been 'updated to reflect those concerns.' Only after a reporter pressed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue's spokesman Josh Earnest to confirm that monitoring had been 'intensified' did he admit that was the case. Scroll down for video . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not confirm today that a Taliban detainee released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl made contact with members of al Qaeda and tried to join the group's ranks. He did say one of the former prisoners has been put under 'intensified' surveillance in Qatar amid 'concerns' Suspicious: South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham claimed this week that the five former Gitmo detainees in Qatar have 'had some Haqqani people come to meet with them.' Graham suggested 'they're reaching out' to the terrorist group in hopes of rejoining the fight against the U.S. Earlier this week, Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who recently visited Qatar, asserted that all five former Taliban fighters in Qatar's custody may be looking to return to the battlefield. 'They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan,' he told the Associated Press. Under an agreement negotiated with the Taliban to free Bergdahl in May of 2014, the men must stay in Qatar for a year under surveillance. After that time, they may go wherever they please. Pointing out that 'it's just a year deal,' Graham told AP, 'Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.' The South Carolina Republican, who is 'testing the waters' for a presidential run, said he was concerned one of the detainees had left Qatar, but was assured during his visit that all five senior Taliban officials remain in the tiny nation on the Arabian Peninsula. 'I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,' he said. The White House said Friday that it is certain that all five prisoners are still under lock and key, and Earned gave reporters a full-throated assurances that monitoring measures 'mitigate' the threat posed by the former detainees. 'None of these individuals has returned to the battlefield, none of them is allowed to travel outside of Qatar, and none has engaged in physical violence,' he said. 'In fact, each of them, at this moment, is still in Qatar, and each of them is subject to monitoring and other mitigation efforts that limit their activity.' Earnest said the U.S. is regularly' in touch with Qatar about the former prisoners and the fact that the monitoring was updated amid concerns shows that there is 'good cooperation' from Qatar and 'good coordination' between the two countries that 'is protecting American security.' The top State Department spokeswoman made a similar observation during her Friday briefing. 'The fact that our mitigation measures helped alert us to potential concerns about one of these individuals means that our mitigation measures are working and have allowed us to make appropriate adjustments in a timely manner to properly mitigate any potential threats,' she said, according to CNN. Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in May 2014 in exchange for the release of the five Taliban detainees from Guantanamo. Qatar now monitors the detainees and will continue to do so until the end of May . Mohammed Nabi . Abdul Haq Wasiq: Served as the Taliban deputy minister of intelligence . Mullah Norullah Nori: A senior Taliban commander in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban fought U.S. forces in late 2001. Khairullah Khairkhwa: Served in various Taliban positions including interior minister and had direct ties to Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden. Mohammed Nabi: Served as chief of security for the Taliban in Qalat, Afghanistan, and later worked as a radio operator for the Taliban's communications office in Kabul. Mohammad Fazl: Human Rights Watch says could be prosecuted for war crimes for presiding over the mass killing of Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001 as the Taliban sought to consolidate their control over the country. Mohammad Fazzi (left) and Mullah Norullah Nori (right) Khairullah Khairkhwa (left) and Abdul Haq Wasiq (right) When previously contacted for comment by CNN, the White House had referred questions to the Pentagon which, in turn, declined to say which of the five men was allegedly in touch with the Taliban. However, U.S. intelligence set up to intercept all five men's communications in Qatar has revealed that one of them 'reached out' in recent months to try to encourage militant activity, according to CNN. The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees. 'However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,' the statement said. 'The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.' Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to U.S. troops in the war. The network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban, yet operates with some degree of autonomy. Even with knowledge that one of the prisoners included in the swap may be preparing to rejoin the fight against the U.S., the White House said today that it does not regret making the deal that allowed Sgt. Bergdahl to return home. Earnest said Obama was abiding by a 'principle, that has a lot of precedent, that this president is firmly committed to.' 'As the Commander in Chief, it's his responsibility that no man or woman who wears the uniform of the United States military is left behind,' he said. 'That ultimately is where this debate stops for him.' The president also stands by his commitment to shutdown the Guantanamo Bay prison for foreign fighters, his spokesman said, and 'only serves as a recruitment tool for terrorists' and damages America's standing with countries it needs as allies in the war on terror. The U.S. has recently quickened the pace of the release of Guantanamo detainees as the Obama administration hopes to shut down the facility for good. The White House said Friday that allegations that one of the freed detainees was trying to rejoin the fight against the U.S. had not changed its calculus . Worth it? The White House says so.  It said today that it doesn't regret swapping the men for Sgt.

"David Cameron yesterday accused Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby of ‘talking down’ the North of England. In unusually direct criticism, the Prime Minister described the Church of England’s views on the North as ‘outdated’ and ‘condescending’. His comments follow a recent article by the Archbishop in which he said ‘entire cities are being cast aside and left to their own devices’. David Cameron has called Archbishop Justin Welby's views on the North 'outdated' and 'condescending' after a Church of England report said the region is heading backwards while the South surges ahead . Archbishop Welby also claimed that most of the country outside London and the South East had been left ‘abandoned and hopeless’, watching the wealth of the capital grow while they are trapped in a ‘vicious circle of decline’. Mr Cameron has now hit back, telling BBC Radio Manchester the Church was guilty of ‘just painting a picture that everything in the North is somehow going in the wrong direction’. Cameron pointed to Manchester as a revived city where unemployment rates have been lower in recent years than in London . He said: ‘Where I don’t agree with some of the things the Church of England said is I think there was an element of talking down the performance of some of our cities, including cities like Manchester, which in recent years have seen something of a revival. ‘When you look at the transport investment in Manchester, when you look at some of the infrastructure that’s being put in, you look at some of the great buildings that are going up, the growth in jobs, the fact that you’ve got a city council that’s working incredibly closely with the Government over issues like the ‘‘Northern powerhouse’’... ‘I thought the Church of England report rather outdated. I found it a bit condescending when it came to our great Northern cities. I don’t think it was really up to date on what is happening. 'I accept there are still regional disparities that we need to deal with but I don’t think we deal with them by just painting a picture that everything in the North is somehow going in the wrong direction and everything in the South is going in the right direction.’ Mr Cameron pointed out that employment rates in Manchester had been higher in recent years than those in London. He added: ‘If you talk to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce or the chambers of commerce in cities like Leeds and Newcastle, I would rather hope they would say the same thing.’ The Prime Minister also defended the benefit cap which he has pledged to cut to £23,000 after the election if the Tories win. He said: ‘I think it is right to say you shouldn’t get more [if you are] out of work than a family that is in work. 'Otherwise we send a totally perverse signal that somehow it’s better off to spend a life on benefits when you can work.’","Church of England report said North's cities left 'abandoned and hopeless'

"A Celtic punk rock band has given a Wisconsin governor a press clear message about using their song as entrance music, telling him 'we literally hate you'. Scott Walker used the Dropkick Murphys song 'I'm Shipping Up to Boston' for his entrance music at the Iowa Freedom Summit on Saturday. The band tweeted: 'Please stop using our music in any way…we literally hate you !!! Love, Dropkick Murphys.' The Dropkick Murphys have told Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker to stop using their song, 'I'm Shipping Up To Boston'; the politician used it as entrance music at a recent summit . The tweet the Celtic punk band sent the governor on Saturday after learning he used their song . Governor Scott Walker, pictured, used the band's song at the Iowa Freedom Summit on Saturday . The band's song, originally written by Woody Guthrie, is their biggest hit and was used in the Martin Scorsese's Oscar-winning film The Departed. Guthrie is a folk singer famous for his left-wing protest songs. This isn't the first time Dropkick Murphys, who have a close relationship with workers' rights activists, have taken a swipe at Gov. Walker. The band was also criticized his 'anti-union' policies. Dropkick Murphys isn't the first band to take issue with politicians using their music to promote themselves. John Mellencamp, pictured above with Meg Ryan, has also taken issue with Gov Walker using his songs . Tom Petty, right, sent a cease-and-desist order to George W Bush for using his song 'I Won't Back Down' John Mellencamp complained to Gov.

"One of the few remaining airworthy Spitfires is feared to have been lost to the nation after an 'ill-conceived' deal by the RAF Museum. The museum, in Hendon, North London, used it to 'pay' a firm to recover another historic aircraft from the Sahara. But three years on the museum, of which Prince Philip is a patron, says it may never see the RAF Kittyhawk P40, which was discovered almost perfectly preserved in the middle of the Western Desert in Egypt. Scroll down for video . Lost to the nation: The Spitfire PK664 that the RAF Museum in Hendon, North London, used to pay a salvage company to recover another historic British warplane from the Sahara desert in Egypt . Although the aircraft was recovered nearly intact in 2012 and taken in a shipping container to El Alamein, it is stuck there as a result of the turmoil that has gripped Egypt since the Arab Spring. There is a possibility that the authorities in Cairo will deem it to be Egyptian property. The museum's annual report admits: 'Given the uncertain political situation in Egypt there is a possibility that Kittyhawk may never be returned.' However, Iain Thirsk, head of collections at the museum, said: 'We are still hoping to get it back to the UK.' Meanwhile Kennet Aviation, the Essex-based firm that salvaged the Kittyhawk, was handed Spitfire PK664 as payment. Ray Burgess, treasurer of the Spitfire Society, said: 'There are 18 flying Spitfires in the UK. They are very important and have come to symbolise all those people who died in them. So we are very sorry to hear that one has gone from being owned for the nation to private hands.' He also criticised the British authorities over the recovery of the Kittyhawk, which crashed in 1942, as no attempt was made to recover the remains of the pilot, Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping. There was evidence that he survived the impact but perished in the inhospitable desert. In the latest RAF Museum annual report, it states: 'In 2012 the museum undertook a joint project with Kennet Aviation to recover RAF Kittyhawk ET574 from the Egyptian desert in exchange for one of the Spitfires from the museum's collection. 'The aircraft has been successfully retrieved and for the time being remains in secure storage in Egypt. 'Given the uncertain political situation in Egypt however there is a possibility that Kittyhawk may never be returned to the United Kingdom.' Relic: The RAF Kittyhawk P40 discovered almost perfectly preserved in the middle of the Egyptian desert . In limbo: Although the aircraft was recovered nearly intact in 2012 and taken in a shipping container to El Alamein, it is stuck there as a result of the turmoil that has gripped Egypt since the Arab Spring . The report values the grounded Spitfire at £200,000. An airworthy Spitfire with some historic significance is generally valued at between £1m to £3m. Pat Chriswick, a military aviation historian, said: 'The RAF Museum have done a deal where they have got no delivery whatsoever. They have been incredibly naive. 'Surely there should have been some arrangement whereby it was dependent on the success of the recovery project. 'The Kittyhawk was recovered from the desert and taken to El Alamein. It is not a big surprise that the aircraft hasn't left the country. 'The exchange was ill-conceived and badly managed. The RAF Museum has nothing to show for it and the nation has lost a perfectly good and valuable Spitfire.' William Pryor-Bennett, the nephew of Fl Sgt Copping, has previously said: 'The priority should be on finding my uncle rather than the plane. 'The plane is of little interest to me, if they recover it and bring it to the UK then great, but there should be more focus of searching for him. 'It's terrible that the RAF Museum have been short-changed like they have.' Mr Thirsk described the matter as 'very frustrating' and confirmed the deal to give Kennet Aviation the Spitfire was in exchange for the recovery of the Kittyhawk. He said: 'The situation in Egypt is very unstable. There is no formal undertaking or promise (to get the Kittyhawk) but we are working on that. 'The matter is not high on the agenda of the Egyptians. 'We are continuing to work with them. It is very frustrating. To us it (the Kittyhawk) is very important but the Egyptian government have far more important things to think about.' Very rare: This Super Marine Spitfire EP120 MK V belonging to the Fighter Collection based at Duxford is one of only four airworthy examples of the Mk V Spitfire anywhere in the world still flying . Simon Brand, the defence attache at the British Embassy in Cairo, said: 'The plane is still in Egypt. 'It doesn't belong to the British government, it was found on the soil of a sovereign territory and they have a right to claim ownership of it.' It is not clear what Kennet Aviation's intentions are with the Spitfire which is believed to be in storage in a hangar at an airfield in Essex. Spitfire PK664 first flew in November 1945 - after the end of World War Two - and issued to 615 Squadron at RAF Biggin Hill, Kent, in 1949. It then entered storage and in 1954 it became a 'gate guardian' on display outside various RAF bases. The MoD donated PK664 to the RAF Museum which in turn loaned it to the Science Museum in London for display. In more recent years it entered the RAF Museum's reserve collection.","Museum used the grounded Spitfire to pay a firm to recover an RAF Kittyhawk P40 discovered preserved in the Sahara desert .

"A third of children are now officially considered overweight, worrying figures have revealed. The crisis is at its worst among those aged 11 to 15, with almost four in ten at risk from damaging levels of fat. A 20-year study of electronic health records lays bare the problem among children in England. It shows the numbers classed as overweight or obese jumped by about 8 per cent a year in the late 1990s. Scroll down for video . A study by King’s College London found that a third of children in England are now officially considered overweight and almost four in ten 11 to 15-year-olds are at risk from damaging levels of fat (file picture) The rates of increase have slowed in the last decade, fuelling hopes the rise may have levelled off. But experts warned there was no room for complacency and extra efforts must be made to rescue the ‘lost generation’ of overweight teenagers. The figures are particularly concerning as obese children have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease in later life. They are also more likely to experience bullying, low self-esteem and depression. Obesity costs the NHS £5billion a year. Researchers from King’s College London used the anonymised electronic health care records of more than 370,500 children aged two to 15 between 1993 and 2013. They found the number who were overweight or obese increased by around 8 per cent a year during the first decade of the study. But between 2004 and 2013 rates slowed substantially to 0.4 per cent a year, suggesting the growth in obesity may have levelled off. The group most affected were those aged 11 to 15, with 38 per cent of boys in this age range found to be overweight or obese in 2013. The pattern is similar among girls, says an online report in the Archives of Disease in Childhood. Among both sexes and all age groups, the proportion of children judged too heavy was around a third in 2013. The researchers said the fact obesity rates had stabilised suggested public health campaigns may be starting to work. But other experts are concerned that strategies to deal with child obesity are not proving effective. These include the Government’s flagship ‘responsibility deal’, under which food and drinks manufacturers set their own targets for cutting sugar and fat. Professor Julian Hamilton-Shield, of Bristol University, said telling children to eat less and exercise did nothing to address the amount of time they spent looking at computer, television or smartphone screens. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘The real problem is among children aged 11 to 15 who are really getting fatter.’ He added that efforts should be made to reduce the number of women who start off their pregnancies overweight and obese. ‘This starts the whole cycle in children,’ he said. ‘Fat women produce fat babies who are at greater risk of many health problems from the beginning of life.’ Dr Colin Michie, chairman of the nutrition committee of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said young teenagers ‘are likely to be easily influenced by the world around them, through advertising and access to pocket money-priced fast food’. He added: ‘The result – heavier children mean higher rates of serious obesity-related health conditions like type 2 diabetes. 'If we are to make inroads we need to create a healthy environment by ensuring that children are not exposed to junk food advertising before the 9pm watershed, licences for fast food restaurants are not granted to restaurants close to schools or colleges, a taxation on foods high in salt, sugar and fat is explored and young people are taught how to cook healthy meals in school much earlier.’ Public Health England’s Eustace de Sousa said: ‘Overall childhood obesity rates have remained stable since 2010. 'However, for children from the poorest households, levels have continued to worsen, so there is no room for complacency.’ Professor Hamilton-Shield, a paediatrician and diabetes specialist, said: ‘The childhood obesity crisis in England is far from over and our current weapons in the war against fat seem unlikely to provide the answer.’","Almost four in ten 11 to 15-year-olds at risk from damaging levels of fat .

Phenduka tweeted: 'I would like to apologize to 5FM listeners who took offense in today 'fresh & vrot ' (a comedy segment).The intention wasn't to offend.' The radio station announced the suspension on Twitter and said it was in 'utterly poor taste.' No one has been charged over the attack on the family. Marli's brother Henri, 20, is staying with relatives, according to news24, which has reported that local police have denied earlier reports he was questioned. Devastated friends who knew the family in Australia paid tribute to the axe attack victims on Thursday. The family were based in Perth and on the Sunshine Coast before returning to South Africa in mid-2014. 'You are a true blue genuine mate my friend,' said Rudi's university friend Afif Norzal, 22, who was in all of Rudi's classes at the University of Melbourne, in an online tribute. 'At times when I didn't have anyone to talk to, you would definitely make me feel the most welcome... I will always love you.' Family friend Retha Dutton said Rudi was visiting his parents and siblings before he was set to return to university for his final year of his Masters of Engineering. 'He was one of those guys - me being from a different culture - he was one of the first friends who genuinely connected with me,' Mr Norzal told Daily Mail Australia in an interview. 'He was one of those people when he talked to you, you genuinely knew this guy wanted to be your mate.' 'He was a really chilled and laidback person. He never stressed about anything.' Mr Norzal, from Malaysia, described the family as 'loving'. He graduated from Trinity College in 2011 and completed a Bachelor of Science at the university in 2013. In a statement, a spokesman for the University of Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia: 'A Dean’s honors list member for Science in 2011, Rudi was a keen sportsman and was highly regarded amongst his peers as a good-natured and friendly person, someone who was always willing to lend a hand and help out younger students.' Henri returned to South Africa with his parents in mid-2014. He had been living at Trinity College where his brother was staying while studying at the University of Melbourne in 2013. Both attended Scotch College in Perth. 'Teresa was a lovely mother,' Ms Dutton told Daily Mail Australia.

"The Tesla Model S P85D is best known for it stomach-churning acceleration and zero-RMP torque. But just as impressive is a little-known feature that gives it the ability to receive over-the-air software updates any time a Tesla engineer discovers an improvement. Now one of these upgrades is set to make the P85D even faster, according to a tweet by Tesla's founder, Elon Musk. Scroll down for video . Earlier today, the group's founder, Elon Musk, revealed on Twitter that the P85D would be receiving an upgrade using a new algorithm that would make it even faster . 'Tesla P85D 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm.' he wrote. Musk was referring to something known as the 'insane mode' which allows the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 in a little over three seconds. Earlier this week, a car website took passengers on a ride in the dual motor sedan and filmed their reactions when Insane mode hits. The video was filmed by Florida-based DragTimes. It shows a driver, known only as Brooks, taking people on a ride in the $120,000 (£80,000) car. For each test, Brooks brings the car to a standstill before pushing the accelerator to the ground.

When the Insane mode is activated, one woman is shown holding onto the ceiling and clutching her chest (pictured). A male passenger is then filmed swearing as the car pulls away at speed . At the launch event, Mr Musk said the car reaches 60mph in three seconds from a standstill. During recent tests of the Insane acceleration, also carried out by DragTimes, the car achieved the speed in 3.17 seconds . The D model, unveiled in October has two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels. It has a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h), compared with the current 130 mph (209 km/h) on Tesla’s previous S model. It offers two Sport and Insane acceleration.

In Insane Mode, the full 691 horsepower of the electric car's two motors is applied in one go. At the launch event, Mr Musk said the car reaches 60mph in three seconds from standing still. During recent tests of the Insane acceleration, also carried out by DragTimes, the car achieved the speed in 3.17 seconds. As the site explained: ‘There is no complicated launch control to engage, no traction control to disable, no power braking, no RPMs to worry about. 'All you have to do is stomp on the accelerator and off you go, pulling over 1.2Gs off the line, enough to embarrass and give a hard time to just about any car that might be next to you.’ These speeds put the P85D on a par with the likes of Lamborghini’s Gallardo LP570-4 Spyder Performante and the 2014 Porsche 911 GT3. In Sport mode, by comparison, the same speed was reached in 4.04 seconds during DragTimes' tests.

"Most lawyers aren't faced with a wall of cameras when they walk into court - but despite being there to fight a major human rights case, Amal Clooney took the attention in her stride. When a reporter joked that she was expected to wear Versace, she pointed at her gown and collar bands before replying: 'I'm wearing Ede & Ravenscroft'. The retort, made yesterday at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, was a reference to a firm of London tailors which has been making barristers' gowns since 1689. Scroll down for video . Unfazed: Human rights barrister Amal Clooney, who appeared at the European Court of Human Rights with her boss Geoffrey Robertson QC, replied to 'fashion speculation' by saying: 'I'm wearing Ede & Ravenscroft' Well-known: The joke was a reference to the firm of London tailors which has made legal robes since 1689 . Her remarks quickly gained traction on Twitter, where users praised the respected lawyer's ability to shrug off the celebrity status she has enjoyed since marrying George Clooney last year. 'Amal, can I be you, like just for a day at least?' asked one. Another wrote:  'Well played!' The attention even forced the journalist who asked the original question, a political correspondent for 13 years, to write an article responding to the hype. Bruno Waterfield had sparked the talk by tweeting Mrs Clooney's response after he asked her about 'fashion speculation'. But he insisted he asked her the question ironically - after noting 'the circus in a court that the media, and certainly paparazzi, are not usually interested in'. Serious case: Mrs Clooney and Mr Robertson were in court to challenge the appeal of Doğu Perinçek, a Turkish politician who denied the killing of 1.5million Armenians in 1915 was genocide . Case: The pair argued for Armenia, which says disputing the massacre is equivalent to Holocaust denial . Row: The remarks were reported in a tweet by Bruno Waterfield, a political correspondent for 13 years . He explained what happened next when he spoke to Mrs Clooney and her colleague, the seasoned human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC. 'I ask him about the media circus,' he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'He expresses surprise at the number of photographers in the court. I joke about the frenzy. '""I think they expected you turn up in Versace,"" I said to her. She replied.' He added: 'Mr Robertson said he was was surprised at the rows of photographers. 'He said he was pleased that coverage of the case would focus attention on Mrs Clooney's career as a lawyer rather than her private life as the wife of a Hollywood actor and director.' When asked about fashion, Mrs Clooney joked that she was wearing robe maker Ede & Ravenscroft . Denial: Turkish Workers Party leader Doğu Perinçek claims that he has the right to deny the Armenian genocide under freedom of expression - but his remarks provoked outrage among relatives of the dead . Never forget: One photograph shows men standing behind a mass grave containing the remains of Armenian victims slaughtered by the Ottoman Turks during the 1915 genocide . Amal's boss, Geoffrey Robertson QC, is founder and head of Doughty Street Chambers. He has argued many landmark human rights cases in British and Commonwealth Courts and the European Court of Human Rights. He has defended several high-profile clients, including Salman Rushie and Julian Assange, and taken part in proceedings against General Augusto Pinochet . Mr Robertson is also the author of two books on the 1915 genocide, 'Was there an Armenian Genocide?', published in 2009, and 'An Inconvenient Genocide: Who Now Remembers the Armenians?', out last year. Mrs Clooney and Mr Robertson were in court to challenge the appeal of Doğu Perinçek, a Turkish politician who denied the killing of 1.5million Armenians in 1915 was genocide. He was found guilty by a Swiss court in 2008 after saying the killings were an 'international lie' and his appeal is now being challenged by Armenia, who have hired Mr Robertson's London chambers. The nation argues that denying the 1915 genocide is a crime on par with Holocaust denial. This April marks the 100th anniversary of the massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks. The killings in 1915 are regarded by many historians as the first genocide of the 20th century, and are said to have inspired Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Turkey rejects the term ‘genocide,’ says the death figure is inflated and that people died on both sides as the Ottoman Empire collapsed amid World War I. Mrs Clooney is a barrister with the London chamber, specialising in human rights, international law, and extradition. She speaks three languages fluently - English, French and Arabic - and has represented Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Last year, the accomplished lawyer advised Greece on how to get Britain to return the disputed statues known as the Elgin Marbles.

"Mandarin Chinese is the world's most spoken language, so it's no wonder  more and more people want to learn how to read, write and speak it. And if you want to learn the basics without paying for an expensive course there are now a host of apps that can teach you for free. And many, such as London-based Memrise, turn this learning into a game to make it fun, while also improving how much the brain takes in and recalls. Scroll down for video . Memrise, along with rivals Skritter and ChineseSkill, all feature interactive tools that entertain as well as teach - a trend known as 'gamification.' Users commit Chinese characters and definitions to memory with the help of animations and mnemonics. For example, the symbol for 'cow' resembles a cow and neck yoke (pictured) Memrise, along with rivals Skritter and ChineseSkill, all feature interactive tools that entertain as well as teach - a trend known as 'gamification' - pioneered by large education apps such as DuoLingo. 'We want to be a very popular game and we want people to play when they're bored,' Gina Gotthilf from DuoLingo added. With Memrise, users commit Chinese characters and definitions to memory with the help of animations and mnemonics. For example, the symbol for 'cow' resembles a cow carrying a neck yoke. And 'noodles' look like a bowl of noodles being eaten with chopsticks. Users are notified to review the characters periodically - a technique known as 'spaced repetition'. The firm compares the learning process to 'growing a garden of memory', with the premise being that when users learn words, they plant virtual seeds, which 'grow and bloom the more they review and practise.' Memrise also offers a range of other language courses, as well as courses about art, history, chemistry, politics, and more. DuoLingo does not currently offer a Chinese course, however. 'In a lot of Western countries we now see ourselves as competitive with Candy Crush', said Ben Whately, who worked on Memrise's Chinese courses. 'Candy Crush is effective because it adjusts the difficulty level to just the right level for you. 'Adapting to a level where people feel clever is a great way to keep them playing. 'That is exactly what our learning algorithm does: adjusts when you are tested so that you always have to struggle a little bit, but you are generally successful.'

The learning technique builds on those used by games, such as Candy Crush (pictured), in which each level gets progressively more difficult .

A lesser-considered obstacle in Chinese learning is learning to write characters correctly, a time-consuming technique that greatly enhances a person's ability to remember them. App Skritter instructs users on the order and direction of strokes with bright graphics and feedback that flashes when they miss. 'The only way to quickly learn lots of characters is to write them 20 to 30 times,' said Hong Kong-based businessman Brad Jester. 'I started by doing this on paper, but Skritter is better because it replays them for you in a better timed sequence.' A key question is whether these methods work any better than traditional immersion in a native-speaking environment or a traditional classroom. Mr Jester, now a fluent speaker, added: 'People sometimes think they can take the easy route of using flashcards and dictionaries to learn Chinese but that is 100 per cent not the case. 'Until these apps shame you into studying harder, they will just be helpful tools that reinforce lessons learned,' he said. But, linguistics expert Dr. Peter Crosthwaite of the University of Hong Kong believes such apps may facilitate memorisation - an important aspect of language learning - but cannot offer the holistic approach a good teacher would deliver. 'Due to the continued growth and expansion of China's economy, more people than ever are wishing to learn Chinese,' Dr Crosthwaite said. However, 'there are very, very few examples of the internet being used to teach someone a language from a beginner to advanced level of proficiency,' he cautioned.","Chinese is one of the many courses available on learning app Memrise .

"Cooler, ice box, cool box: Whatever you call it, this mainstay of picnics around the globe has barely been innovated upon for several decades. Not any more, though - Oregon-based Ryan Grepper has unveiled his innovative ‘Coolest’ device that has a host of different features, and it's currently taking the internet by storm. Combining Bluetooth functionality, a smartly designed interior, off-road wheels, a blender and more, Grepper is hoping that his innovation is going to change the world of coolers forever. An Oregon-based inventor has designed a new type of food and drink cooler. Known as 'Coolest' (pictured) the product has racked up £1.2 million ($2 million) on Kickstarter in just a few days. The multi-functional product has a number of different features on offer . The project is currently just a few days into a Kickstarter campaign but has already racked up more than £1.2 million ($2 million) from more than 10,000 backers . - 18v battery-powered rechargeable blender . - Removable waterproof Bluetooth speaker . - USB charger . - LED lid light . - Gear tie-down . - Cooler divider/cutting board . - Extra wide easy rolling tyres . - Integrated storage for plates and knife . - Bottle opener . The device can be bought by residents of the U.S. now for £96 ($165), while customers in the EU and Canada can get one for £108 ($185). The release date is expected by February 2015, although higher pledges get access to earlier releases - and for £1,200 ($2,000) the inventor himself will attend a party you host. From the outside the Coolest is similar in shape and size to a regular cooler. On its top though is a blender, which can be used with a supplied jug to mix up drinks and food. A single charge of the device, via the mains, will apparently allow for 27 litres (six gallons) of liquid to be blended. Wireless speakers are also included on the exterior, which can be connected to by a Bluetooth-enabled device. These are also waterproof, preventing them becoming damaged from spillages or the rain. The interior of the Coolest (shown) is designed to separate things you want to keep relatively dry with ice to be used in the blender. Inside there are also compartments for plates to be stored, and there's a ceramic knife that can be used to cut limes, lemons and whatnot on top of the cooler . Other features of the multi-purpose cooler include a USB charger, LED lights inside to light up when it’s dark and a tie-down to hold equipment on top. Beach-ready tyres make it easy to drag over rough terrain, while an interior divider can keep surplus ice separate. The final feature of the jack-of-all-trades device is a bottle opener on its exterior. ‘The Coolest is a portable party disguised as a cooler, bringing blended drinks, music and fun to any outdoor occasion,’ Grepper writes on Kickstarter. ‘Regular coolers are boring, break easily and are a hassle to haul around just to carry the ice. ‘The Coolest cooler is 60 quarts of awesome packed with so much fun you'll look for excuses to get outside more often.’ Responding to suggestions from backers, Grepper has more plans for the product in future as well, including alternative colours and possibly even solar panels to charge it.

"Teenage stock clerk Pedro Hernandez was just a name in a file for decades, one of many people police encountered while searching for a 6-year-old boy named Etan Patz. Thirty-five years later, Hernandez is going on trial in a case that shaped the nation's approach to missing children. Opening statements are set for Friday in Hernandez's murder and kidnapping trial. He emerged as a suspect in 2012, based on a tip and a videotaped confession that prosecutors say was foreshadowed by remarks he made to friends and relatives in the 1980s. His defense will hinge on convincing jurors that the confession is false, along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted Pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years. Scroll down for video . Justice for Etan: Pedro Hernandez (left), pictured in 2012, will go on trial Friday for the 1979 kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz (right) This May 28, 2012, file photo shows a newspaper with a photograph of Etan Patz at a makeshift memorial in the SoHo neighborhood of New York where Patz lived before his disappearance on May 25, 1979 . 'It will be, I think, an extremely interesting case,' state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley told prospective jurors earlier this month, adding that those chosen would be in for 'an experience they'll never forget.' In sifting through evidence that reaches back to 1979, jurors will delve into a missing child case that helped inject a new protectiveness into American parenting. Last seen walking alone to his school bus stop, Etan became one of the first missing children featured on milk cartons. His parents helped advocate for legislation that created a nationwide law-enforcement framework to address such cases, and the anniversary of his disappearance became National Missing Children's Day. The trial is expected to last up to three months and feature witnesses including Etan's mother, psychologists, an inmate informant who knows Hernandez, and possibly other informants testifying against the earlier suspect. Selection of the jury to weigh the fate of the former deli worker concluded on Thursday before Judge Maxwell Wiley in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. More than half of them were dismissed after completing a detailed 22-page questionnaire that asked about their knowledge of the case, which has gotten national attention for more than three decades. Some potential jurors were asked if the lack of a body would make it difficult for them to convict someone of a crime. Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi told them the case would not feature 'high tech forensic evidence,' but would take them back 35 years 'to a time when the Brady Bunch was still on TV.' The seven-man, five-woman jury was culled from a pool of about 700 people. Some openly wondered about bringing a case to trial after so many years. A look back: In this March 17, 1980, photo, Stan and Julie Patz stand on the second-floor fire escape of the of their loft in the SoHo neighborhood of New York.  Below them runs Prince Street, along which Etan, their 6-year-old son, set off to school on May 25, 1979, never to return . Stan and Julie Patz, Etan's parents, are expected to testify during the trial of their son's accused killer . Mistaken identity: In this combination of two file photos, convicted child molester Jose Antonio Ramos, left, and Pedro Hernandez, right,  are shown. For years, Julie and Stan Patz were sure that it was Ramos who abducted and killed their son . 'A lot of time has elapsed, and a lot of things have probably changed. ... It's 35-year-old memories,' one man said during questioning earlier this week. He was not selected. Prosecutors have spotlighted Hernandez's videotaped, hours-long confessions, in which he says he offered Etan a soda to entice him into the basement of the Manhattan convenience store where Hernandez worked. Then, Hernandez said, he choked the boy and dumped him, still alive, in a box with some curbside trash. Etan's body has never been found. 'Something just took over me, and I was just choking him,' said Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, New Jersey. 'He just kind of stood there, and I just felt bad, what I did.' Defense lawyers say Hernandez' confession is fiction, dreamed up by a mentally ill man with a low IQ and a history of hallucinations — and fueled by over six hours of police questioning before Hernandez was read his rights. After confessing, Hernandez told a defense psychologist his memory of the killing 'feels like a dream' and he wasn't sure it had really happened. 'You've heard the term ""false confession?""' defense lawyer Harvey Fishbein asked during jury questioning this week. False confessions happen — sometimes in cases as notorious as the killing of child beauty pageant star JonBenet Ramsey — but they are hard to quantify. This building at the corner of Prince Street and Broadway housed a convenience store where Pedro Hernandez, accused of killing Patz, told police 33 years after they boy's disappearance that he choked the 6-year-old and put the still-living boy into a plastic bag, boxed up the bag and left it on a street . They factor in about 15 to 25 per cent of known cases that ended in exonerations, said Allison Redlich, a University of Albany criminal justice professor. A defense psychologist wrote that Hernandez's psychological problems and intellectual limitations make him more likely than other people to confess falsely. Prosecutors dispute that conclusion and call the confession credible. Hernandez's lawyers also plan to point to longtime suspect Jose Ramos, a Pennsylvania prisoner who dated a woman who sometimes cared for Etan. For years, Julie and Stan Patz were sure that it was Ramos who abducted and killed their son. Authorities said Ramos made incriminating statements when questioned about Etan in the 1980s, though he never confessed to killing the boy. Ramos has denied it, but a civil court found him liable for Etan's death in 2004 after Ramos stopped cooperating with questioning. Hernandez was 18 when Patz disappeared. He later moved to southern New Jersey, where he was living with his wife and daughter at the time of his arrest. A look at the murder case stemming from the 1979 disappearance of Etan Patz, which helped catalyze a national missing-children's campaign. THE CASE . Six-year-old Etan Patz was walking to his Manhattan school bus stop alone for the first time when he vanished May 25, 1979; the anniversary is now National Missing Children's Day. His body has never been found, but his family had him legally declared dead in 2001. The investigation stretched across decades and continents before police announced that Pedro Hernandez had confessed in May 2012. He worked at a convenience store in Etan's neighborhood but was never a suspect until police got a tip shortly before his arrest. Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty. THE PROSECUTION . Prosecutors' case appears to center on Hernandez's confessions to them and police, plus statements authorities say he made to a friend, his ex-wife and a church prayer group in the 1980s about having harmed a child in New York. The prosecution team, led by veteran Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, hasn't alluded to any physical evidence against Hernandez, and his defense has said there is none. It recently emerged that an inmate informant will testify against Hernandez, but the person's identity and details of the prospective testimony haven't been released. In his video-recorded confessions, Hernandez tranquilly recounts offering soda to entice Etan into the convenience store basement and choking him. He says he put the still-living boy into a plastic bag, boxed up the bag and left it on a street. Prosecutors call the confessions credible, and Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ruled they could be used at trial. The decision followed a weekslong hearing on whether Hernandez was properly advised of his rights to stay silent and mentally capable of understanding them. THE DEFENSE . Hernandez's defense maintains his confessions are the false imaginings of a man who has an IQ in the lowest 2 percent of the population and has problems discerning reality from fiction. He has taken anti-psychotic medication for years and has been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, which includes the characteristics of social isolation and odd beliefs. The defense — led by Harvey Fishbein, who has handled other murder cases involving psychiatric issues — and the prosecution differ on the extent and implications of Hernandez's mental problems. The defense may ask the jury to consider that police questioned Hernandez for more than six hours before reading him his rights and turning on recorders. The defense also wants jurors to hear about longtime suspect Jose Ramos, a convicted Pennsylvania child molester. A civil court declared Ramos responsible for Etan's death after he rebuffed questioning, but he was never criminally charged and has denied involvement. Ramos has refused to testify at Hernandez's trial, saying he'd invoke his rights against self-incrimination, but some evidence about the investigation into Ramos will be allowed. WHAT'S NEXT .

'Every year, four Australians will receive knighthoods in the order of Australia. Today we've had Prince Phillip who joins Prince Charles as a knight in the order of Australia,' he goes on. The clip sees Mr Abbott's knighthood speech imposed over the cringe-worthy first man speech in the film . 'Today we've had Prince Philp, who joins Prince Charles as a Knight in the Order of Australia,' he says to a large crowd, including Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant . 'I'm pleased that the Queen has seen fit to award knighthoods in the Order of Australia to Prince Philip. I think we've had a good thrash at this one.' After this, the crowd bursts into uncontrollable laughter. Parkinson was also behind a viral House of Representatives Seinfeld mash-up video last year, as well as a Jacqui Lambie meets Ghostbusters treatment. On a more serious note, the knighthood decision has sparked barrage of criticism, with former Abbott supporters claiming it could be a fatal blow to his leadership of Australia. Mr Abbott's most high profile media supporter Andrew Bolt told Macquarie Radio it was a 'flabbergasting' choice on Thursday. 'This is just such a pathetically stupid - gosh, I didn't mean to be that strong because I actually like Tony Abbott very much - but this is just such a very, very, very stupid decision, so damaging that it could be fatal,' he said. The knighthood decision seen a string of former Abbott supporters claiming it could be a fatal blow to his leadership of Australia . Media mogul Rupert Murdoch also blasted Tony Abbott's decision to knight Prince Philip in a rare criticism of the Prime Minister. The billionaire derided the knighthood as a 'joke and embarrassment' in a Twitter post on Tuesday morning. He has even garnered criticism from his own party, with Queensland Liberal National Party MPs Warren Entsch and Ewen Jones condemning the decision in various media interviews.","The mash-up video comes from emerging video-editor Huw Parkinson .

"The European space agency has unveiled the full image sequence of Philae's historic descent on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. The probe made its dramatic touchdown on 12 November while the comet was travelling at an incredible 34,000 mph (55,000 km per hour). This series of 19 images tracks the probe's seven hour journey as it fell 14 miles (22.5km) towards the comet's icy surface. Scroll down for video . The latest images were taken from Rosetta’s Osiris camera with the timestamp marked in GMT. Only a few frames of this image series had been made public previously. When Philae first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. While its precise location still remains unknown, early images suggest the probe landed with two legs on the ground and one pointing into space, which is severely limiting its access to sunlight. Since then the search has been on to identify it in higher-resolution images, but now that Rosetta has moved to a different orbit, and is further away from the comet, the chances of observing the lander are less . Previously, only a few frames of this image series had been made public. The latest images were taken from Rosetta’s Osiris camera with the timestamp marked in GMT . While its precise location still remains unknown, early images suggest the probe landed with two legs on the ground and one pointing into space, which is severely limiting its access to sunlight. It is shown here during the fifth stage of its descent . Controllers have now said they will simply wait for Philae to make contact with its mothership. Rosetta engineers in Darmstadt, Germany, will begin to monitor the feed in a few weeks' time and say there could be a chance the communication will be established in May or June. During these months, improved lighting conditions at the probe's assumed location could provide enough power to run the onboard radio transmitter. Radio tests on the probe just before it lost power have narrowed down its location to somewhere in a strip of terrain roughly 350m by 30m. Rosetta camera's scoured this location in early December, and each of its images were scanned by mission controllers to see if they could spot any pixels that were brighter than the rest. But Philae still couldn't be found. If Philae gets its power back, it would resume all science observations, which could take place in August, just when the comet is at its most active phase, according to a report by the BBC. In the meantime, the scientific haul from the comet continues as Rosetta continues its orbit around the icy body - and now illustrations have revealed amazing new details of the comet. An array of colours and diagrams highlight the gravitational field of the comet, thermal energy trapped between its cliffs and organic compounds on its surface. Scientists are hoping to answer many questions about this and other comets, including its formation, structure and evolution over time. Controllers have now said they will wait for Philae to make contact with its mothership. Philae is seen here on its seven-hour descent . When Philae first made contact, a few hours after this image was taken, it failed to fire harpoons causing it to bounce twice before landing . Using data from the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System (Osiris) and the Radio Science Investigation instrument, scientists have now been able to calculate the comet’s gravitational field. They have found that the gravitational force at the ‘lobes’ - the two ends of the comet - is about six times stronger than at the neck - the narrower area connecting the two lobes. It is still unknown whether the two-lobed shape of the comet is the result of two smaller bodies coming together, or if the neck has been ‘eaten’ away over time - like the core of an apple. Currently the latter theory is becoming the preferred explanation, as it appears the two lobes have similar structures – indicating they have the same origin. From this gravitational data scientists also found that comet’s density is about half that of water. Dr Holger Sierks from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, who was involved in the studies, told MailOnline that they now had a greater understanding of the comet's interior. Pictured is the current lander search area. Now that Rosetta has moved to a different orbit, and is further away from the comet, the chances of observing the lander are less, Rosetta engineers have said . The blurry image captures the rapid motion in which Philae was launched back out into space. The probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then to a much lower height of 65ft (20 metres) before coming to rest . Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is showing signs of waking up early as it streaks towards the Sun at  47,800 mph (76,900 km/h). As it approaches the sun, the rubber duck-shaped lump of ice, dust and rock is expected to heat up and release more gas and water vapour from its interior. Comets are most active when they reach perihelion, the point in their orbit when they are closest to the Sun. But even at a distance of more than 200 million miles (320 million km), comet 67P is beginning to stir in dramatic fashion. Dr Dennis Bodewits, from the University of Maryland, US, who led one of several teams reporting latest findings from the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission in the journal Science, said: 'We are already seeing more activity. 'Jets are sprouting up everywhere. We've been surprised to see how active it is. It already has more jets than many other comets do at perihelion.' He said the interior is now thought to be analogous to 'ash, cigarette ash or super-dry powder snow.' Data from several instruments, meanwhile, has shown that the comet’s neck is the source of most of the dust and gas it is ejecting. The reason for this is quite interesting. Based on data, the Rosetta team found that the neck receives less energy than the rest of the comet because it is shaded. However, the two lobes either side trap radiation, with energy being ‘bounced’ between cliffs, causing the neck to be move active. The low gravitational pull of the neck also means that less force is needed to blow its dust and gas away than at the lobes. From the images and data, five basic - but diverse - categories of terrain type have been determined: dust-covered; brittle materials with pits and circular structures; large-scale depressions; smooth terrains; and more ‘rock-like’ surfaces. Much of the comet also appears to be covered in dust, as a result of dust that is dragged along by the comet falling to the surface over time. One prominent and intriguing feature is a 1,640ft (500m) long crack seen roughly parallel to the neck of the comet, running between its two larger lobes at either end. The biggest question remaining about the comet, though, is how it formed. Two predominant theories remain: either it is the result of two smaller bodies ‘sticking’ together, forming a single comet, or its central neck has been eaten away over time like the core of an apple. Rosetta is essentially living with the comet as it moves towards the sun along its orbit, learning how its behaviour changes on a daily basis and, over longer timescales, how its activity increases, how its surface may evolve, and how it interacts with the solar wind,’ said Esa Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor. ‘We have already learned a lot in the few months we have been alongside the comet, but as more and more data are collected and analysed from this close study of the comet we hope to answer many key questions about its origin and evolution.’ This graphic reveals the sequence of huge bounces before the Philae probe came to its final, unknown resting spot in November .","19 images track the probes seven hour journey as it fell 14 miles (22.5km) towards the comet's icy surface .

"The Scottish estate made famous by TV series Monarch of the Glen has been slashed in price by almost £2million as its owners struggle to find a buyer. Balavil Estate, Inverness-shire, was put on the market for £7m but is now up for grabs at offers of over £5.25million after being on the market for more than a year.

In an interview, the Laird of Balavil revealed the mansion is home to a 'kindly and well meaning' ghost called Sarah . The property has been billed as having 'a wonderful combination' of outdoor sports including 'red deer, roe deer and sika deer stalking' Balavil, near Kingussie, caught the imagination of the public after featuring in the show's seven series, and offers the rare opportunity to stalk red deer, shoot grouse and go salmon fishing in the same place. It is the second major Scottish estate to drop its price as landowners are hit by a dip in the market after Killean Estate, Argyll, was reduced in price having been cut from £7.5m. An industry expert suggested land sales in Scotland are suffering from a referendum backlash as wealthy foreign investors remain worried by the prospect of Scottish independence. The selling brochure from Balavil's sellers Strutt and Parker says: 'Situated at the core of the estate amid finely landscaped parkland is the Georgian house. 'Occupying an elevated setting with a southerly outlook across the upper Spey Valley, Balavil House is the centrepiece of the estate.

'It also includes circa 2.7 miles of single bank salmon and trout fishing on the River Spey.' Balavil is owned by the Allan and Marjorie Macpherson-Fletcher and has been in the family since 1790. In an interview in 2013, the Laird of Balavil said: 'We are getting long in the tooth. 'We have put our heart and soul into this place, and now it is time to cash in on that.' He added: 'Seven million and a bit would be grand.' The Laird, then aged 63, also revealed the mansion is home to a 'kindly and well meaning' ghost called Sarah - a maid who fell for the butler above her station then through herself from a bridge. Speaking about the modern age for the Highland sporting estates he said: 'I am surrounded by billionaires. The Danish are over here. We have Arabs on this side. Swedish behind. The other side of the Arabs are Swiss Italian. Beyond them are Egyptians. Beyond them Louis Vuitton, that's all French.' Meanwhile Killean Estate in Argyll, complete with a magnificent mansion house, has been reduced by £2m. It includes a row of arts and crafts properties, a holiday letting business, a hotel, a shop and even a petrol station. The owners have decided to remove 1,500 acres from the sale for a renewable energy project while they wait for a buyer. During the boom years, sporting estates in the Scottish Highlands attracted some of the world's richest people and prices to match. In 1975, Scotland's richest man Emirati businessman Mahdi al-Tajir bought Keir House with 15,000 acres near Stirling for £2m, around £15m in today's prices. Mohamed Al Fayed owns Balnagown Castle 30 miles north of Inverness which he bought in 1972 and has since invested more than £20m in. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the crown prince and ruler of Dubai, bought the 63,000-acre Inverinate Estate in Wester Ross, near the Kyle of Lochalsh, 25 years ago for a reputed £2m, about £4m in today's prices. Strutt and Parker estate agents say reduction in price 'reflects the market and the uncertain condition that prevails'. Pictured is a dining room at Balavil . An industry expert suggested land sales in Scotland are suffering from a referendum backlash as wealthy foreign investors remain worried by the prospect of Scottish independence. Pictured is a games room at Balavil . John Coleman, head of rural estates for Smiths Gore in Scotland, said there was 'no question' the prospect of independence was still playing on the minds of foreign investors. 'For people already living in Scotland it is not such an issue,' he said. 'For people living outwith and looking to invest within Scotland it is a question on their minds. It's going to come round again and we all expect that. The world expects that.' Robert McCulloch of Strutt and Parker, the agent selling the Monarch of the Glen estate, said: 'The reduction reflects the market and the uncertain condition that prevails.' He said the referendum saw buyers and sellers 'hold off' until the outcome was known. The Scottish Government's land reform agenda may also be a factor, say experts. Ministers want to broaden ownership of land in Scotland, much of which is currently held by a little over 400 people. Changes to inheritance laws and tax arrangements have been mooted. Mr McCulloch: 'The Scottish Government's land reform agenda is causing uncertainty in the market.'","Scottish estate seen weekly by fans of the television series Monarch of the Glen was put on the market for £7million .

"White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite has married a ruthless Somali warlord while on the run after ditching her ‘Suicide Brigade’ bodyguards. Sources claim the British fugitive has wed suspected warlord Hassan Maalim Ibrahim who is also known as Sheikh Hassan. He is a senior commander in the radical terror group al-Shabaab which is linked to al-Qaeda. Scroll down for video . White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite has married a ruthless Somali warlord while on the run . Mother-of-four Lewthwaite, 30, originally from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is said to be one of the leading players in Somalia's radical al-Shabaab group. This will be her third marriage and means she will be given protection by her new husband's heavily-armoured group, according to The Daily Mirror. The British-born Muslim convert is on the run after she was suspected of helping to coordinate last September's attack on a Nairobi shopping mall in which 67 people were killed including five Britons. It had been reported earlier this month that she was being protected by a band of loyal al-Qaeda fighters known as the Suicide Brigade. Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay who killed 26 people in the London Tube train attacks in July 2005 . Lewthwaite, the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is believed to be among those planning revenge attacks following the death of al-Qaeda leader Abubakar Shariff Ahmed. Ahmed was killed by unidentified gunmen last month as he and a friend were walking from a court in Mombasa, Kenya to a nearby mosque. Security services now fear she will attack Western-affiliated targets in Africa because she blames the Kenyan government for the death of Ahmed. Ahmed, who had denied meeting Lewthwaite, was suspected of helping more than 100 Britons to join al-Shabaab, which carried out the Westgate Mall shootings in Kenya. Since his death, Kenya has seen a rise in the number of attacks. Last year a copy of Lewthwaite's manifesto transcribed into English by one her recruits revealed her plans to wage war on westerners. Sources claim the British fugitive has wed suspected warlord Hassan Maalim Ibrahim, a senior member of radical terror group al-Shabaab (pictured) The British-born Muslim convert is on the run and is believed to have used this fake South Africa driving licence .

Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber . Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between . King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam. The British Muslim . convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 . people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia. Interpol . issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks . for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011. The 29-year-old is . the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering . the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, . and three others with links to al-Shabaab. They are reportedly living in forests and caves and getting milk from nomadic farmers in the region. She moved to South Africa in 2008 and adopted the identity of an unsuspecting young woman who had moved to the UK with her parents as a baby. Lewthwaite went into hiding in December 2011 after she convinced anti-terror police to let her go when she was arrested following a raid on an al-Shabaab cell. The fugitive has two children by Germaine Lindsay who was one of the men responsible for the London Tube train attacks in 2005. She is also believed to have married terrorist Habib Wahid but it is not known whether he is dead or alive after leading a suicide unit targeting Kenyan soldiers in Somalia. She is also thought to have been in a relationship with Habib Ghani, 28, from Hounslow, Middlesex, who was killed in a gun battle inSomalia last year after falling out with senior al-Shabaab members. Lewthwaite became the world's most wanted woman after she was linked to the Nairobi shopping mall disaster in September last year that killed 67 shoppers including five Britons. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. She is also alleged to have ordered the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to terror-group al-Shabaab. Kenyan security officials have described her as an 'incredible threat' and said they are working 'around the clock' to bring her in. She is now the subject of a manhunt in more than 200 countries.

"For more than a century, this historic clock's chimes have been part of village life, day and night. But they are about to be partially silenced in the latest example of health and safety gone mad – after a complaint from a couple who recently bought the house next door. The decision in Ash, Surrey, was last night slated as a 'politically correct health-and-safety purge' by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who said he was issuing new guidance to councils to prevent it happening again. Battlefield: Victoria Hall (left) and Steve Tai, a legal expert who moved in to the house, four months ago . First, Mr Tai, who works as a case manager at the Royal Courts of Justice, complained to the trust that manages Victoria Hall – the community hall on top of which the three-faced clock stands . 'If people don't like the chime of a bell that has sounded for generations, they should reflect on whether they want to live next door to it in the first place or consider the merits of double glazing,' the minister told the Daily Mail. The row began shortly after legal expert Steve Tai, 44, and his accountant wife Yong Wong, 41, moved to Ash from a nearby village last September. First, Mr Tai, who works as a case manager at the Royal Courts of Justice, complained to the trust that manages Victoria Hall – the community hall on top of which the three-faced clock stands. Then he contacted the parish council and Guildford Borough Council, threatening to sue because the chimes, which have sounded every 15 minutes since 1900, had left the couple unable to sleep and 'depressed'. The trust was advised it would probably lose if the case went to court. So it has now had to buy a bespoke timer for £1,700 plus installation costs to stop the chimes between 11pm and 7am. However, in an inspiring show of community spirit, villagers have chipped in with donations to meet the fee, despite being outraged by the move. The chimes on the clock at Victoria Hall in Ash, Surrey, have sounded every 15 minutes since 1900 . The trust has now had to buy a bespoke timer for £1,700 plus installation costs to stop the chimes . David Brown, of the hall's management committee said: 'There's a lot of resentment that someone can come into a place and stop something that's been going on for 100 years without any real feel for the community in general. 'People have powerful memories of the hall and the clock. It has been a venue for wedding receptions, for all sorts of events and groups. In the First World War ladies gathered there to write letters to men at the Front.' Nigel Manning, chairman of Ash Parish Council, said: 'To my mind it's ""buyer beware"". You can't really miss the clock – it's 90ft tall and right next door.' Mr Pickles's department has now drafted guidance to councils that the local character of a place should be taken into account during noise disputes. 'In recent years, too many town halls have been over-zealous in trying to silence church bells and village clocks which have chimed for decades, if not centuries,' he said. 'We need some common sense to recognise such sounds are part of the fabric of Britain's life, rather than trying to whitewash all the character out of our heritage.' Mr Tai insisted he did not know the clock chimed every 15 minutes when he bought the house for £295,950 after just one viewing. 'We changed the double glazing and paid for sound-proofing but it's still not working,' he said. 'I don't think there's any point that they should chime after 11pm.'","Steve Tai, 44, and his wife Yong Wong, 41, moved to Ash last September .

"A combative Barack Obama took aim Thursday night at Congressional Republicans for embracing social-issues talk about economic inequality as they flex their new majority muscles and look ahead to the 2016 presidential election. The president jabbed at the GOP, who he said have curiously begun emphasizing the needs of America's middle class and those in poverty. 'Even though their policies haven't quite caught up, their rhetoric is starting to sound pretty Democratic,' he said. 'I consider imitation the highest form of flattery.' Obama also filleted Mitt Romney, his 2012 election opponent, for focusing on the economics of ordinary Americans just three years after he was castigated for alienating the country's '47 per cent' who rely on government benefits to make ends meet. 'We've got a former presidential candidate on the other side who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty,' Obama said, drawing jeers from lawmakers. 'That's great. Let's go. Come on. Let's do something about it.' Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama addressed the House Democratic Caucus retreat on January 29, 2015 in Philadelphia . Romney, an early front-runner in the Republican presidential sweepstakes after losing to Obama in 2012, made a campaign-style Wednesday night at Mississippi State University and focused on how the GOP should attack poverty. 'The rich have done historically well,' he said. 'I'm concerned about the middle class and the poor in this country.' Romney said Washington must 'lift people out of poverty' while it 'restore(s) opportunity, particularly for the middle class. He blamed the growing gap between rich and poor on 'liberal policies' emanating from Obama's Oval Office. And he fired back at the presdient with a tweet a few hours after Obama called him out for his newest messaging. 'Mr. Obama, wonder why my concern about poverty?' he wrote in Twitter's compressed 140 character format. 'The record number of poor in your term, and your record of failure to remedy.' In a sign of the partisan rancor that can bleed over into social media, the spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid snarked about Romney calling him 'Mr. Obama.' 'It's President Obama,' Adam Jentleson tweeted. Most of Obama's 20-minute speech Thursday night rehashed themes from his January 20 State of the Union address, but in one respect he put meat on what had been bare-bones messaging. Reporters were ushered out of the room at the Sheraton Philadelphia Society Hill Hotel before a Q-and-A session began. But he is proposing to add $74 billion in new spending, about a 7 per cent increase, to the government's 2016 budget, splitting the additions between defense and domestic priorities . Obama himself proposed a mechanism known as a budget 'sequester' in 2011: Because Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on an annual budget for 2013, the previous year's budget was 'continued' – but with fixed percentages of the funds locked up and made unavailable. When Republicans called his bluff despite a harrowing impact on the Pentagon, the president sought to shift the blame back to them. But Watergate-era journalist Bob Woodward documented the source of the idea in his book, 'The Price of Politics,' showing that the White House pressed the 'sequester' plan on its own. On Thursday the president irged House Democrats to ignore that sequester entirely, complaining about 'manufactured crises and mindless austerity' in Washington. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney fired back Thursday night, only to hear the press spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid pounce over calling the president 'Mr. Obama' in the 140-character Twitter format . REPEAT: Obama gave a State of the Union address on January 20 that contained all the major themes Obama discussed with Democratas on Thursday, essentially subjecting them to a repeat performance . He insisted he would find the money to pay for it by pressing for new taxes that will hit America's top income earners. That plan will undoubtedly hit roadblocks in the form of a Republican Party that now controls both houses of Congress and seems eager to stare Obama down. The president's new budget for 2016 will hit desks Monday morning on Capitol Hill. The GOP is expected to declare it 'dead on arrival' by Monday afternoon. 'I don't think there's going to be a lot of support for going back on the commitments we made to reduce spending,' South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune told the Agence France-Presse newswire on Thursday. 'It's going to be very hard to feature a scenario where Republicans on Capitol Hill are going to go along with some of the president's recommendations to increase spending.' 'Republicans are concerned about the impact of the sequester on the military budget,' he acknowledged. A divided government presents new problems for Obama – has last two years will be his first without Democrats in control of at least half of Congress – and he accepted some of the blame on Thursday for a mid-term election that turned into his party's worst nightmare. 'Obviously we were all disappointed with the outcome of the last election, and there are a lot of reasons for it,' the president said. 'And I'm happy to take on some of the blame.'","Obama lashed out at the GOP during a brief speech to Democratic members of Congress assembled for a retreat in Philadelphia .

"The Islamic State jihadist group killed a senior Kurdish commander and five fighters major attack in Iraq's Kirkuk province today, while bombings elsewhere left a further 27 dead. The  assault on areas south and west of the northern city of Kirkuk began at around midnight, sparking fighting with medium and heavy weapons that was still ongoing this morning. Brigadier General Shirko Rauf and five other members of the Kurdish peshmerga forces were killed in clashes and 46 more were wounded, a police officer and a doctor said. Atif al-Najjar, a commander in the Badr militia, said 500 volunteer 'popular mobilisation' fighters have moved from the town of Tuz Khurmatu to positions in three areas south of Kirkuk to help defend against ISIS.

Kurdish Peshmerga fighters take positions on the side of a road in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk . The Kirkuk province security committee announced a curfew beginning at 10am (7am GMT), saying it will be in effect until further notice. A car bomb also exploded near security headquarters in central Kirkuk city, wounding five people, a police colonel and the doctor said. According to the colonel, suicide bombers who were also armed with other weapons tried to take up positions on the roof of a hotel in the city, but were killed by security forces before they could do so. Meanwhile, security sources said at least 18 people were killed when two bombs went off in Baghdad's Bab al-Sharqi district on Friday morning, home to a large market and across the Tigris river from the Green Zone, which houses most government buildings. Bombings are frequent in Baghdad, where Sunni insurgents from Islamic State, which controls large swathes of territory in Iraq's north and west, regularly conduct suicide attacks. Police officials say the Friday morning attack started with a bomb exploding near carts selling used clothes in the city's central Bab al-Sharqi area. The second explosion, caused by a car bomb, went off two minutes later targeting people who rushed to help the victims from the first blast. Iraqi security forces stand guard near the site of a explosion at a public market that targeted an army gear kiosk in the central Bab al-Sharji area in Baghdad . Three civilians were later killed and at least 10 others wounded in northwestern Baghdad when mortars landed in residential neighbourhoods, police and medics said. Police in the holy city of Samarra, about 125 km (80 miles) north of the capital, said two suicide bombers targeted a security checkpoint in the city centre, killing three and wounding five members of the police and Shi'ite militias. Police say they thwarted a third suicide attack by shooting a suspected militant. But clashes broke out on the western outskirts of Samarra following another explosion, with police and militias battling Islamic State fighters. Samarra holds potent symbolism for Iraqis. In February 2006 Sunni militants blew up a shrine to the ninth century Imam Askari, triggering revenge attacks by Shi'ites which tipped Iraq into years of sectarian violence. Iraq is facing its worst crisis since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops. Militants from the Islamic State group now control about a third of the country.","Kurdish leader and five fighters killed in new ISIS assault on city of Kirkuk .

"A single mom has become a bodybuilding champion after shedding more than 50lbs from her petite 5ft 1in frame. Civil engineer Nichola Smiles, 31, from Sugar Land, Texas weighed 180lbs and wore a size 14/16 before she made fitness her priority. After seeing how 'swollen' her face looked in photo in 2008, she knew she needed to make a change. Now Ms Smiles, who maintains a weight of 125lb, is a bodybuilding competitor, a fitness instructor, a personal trainer and a posing coach - in addition to her full-time job. Scroll down for video . Big goal: In 2008, Nichola Smiles wanted to lose 30lbs before going on a girls trip to Miami (left). After losing more than 50lbs, she is now she is a competitive bodybuilder (right) Fitness solution: After graduating from the University of Houston, Ms Smiles had gained 40lbs (left). Six years later, the 31-year-old maintains a weight of 125lbs (right) She has kept the pounds off for six years, noting that permanent weight loss is about  'changing your relationship with food'. Ms Smiles explained: 'When you get to your final number, you're never done because the hardest part is maintaining.' When it comes to nutrition, she said: 'It's not about the taste. It's about the fuel.' But before she underwent a dramatic physical transformation, Ms Smiles was a young mom and a full-time student struggling with her weight. Ms Smiles, who gave birth to her son Joshua when she was 15-years-old, noticed that her metabolism started to change in college. Although she put on the 'freshman 15' as a student at the University of Houston, she didn't start rapidly gaining weight until after graduation. Courtesy Fitter Smiles . Physical training: The civil engineer started doing workout DVDs in her living room before she had the confidence to join a gym. She is currently a group fitness instructor, as well as a person trainer . Shocking realization: Ms Smiles said she knew she had to make a change after seeing this photo of herself at a friend's wedding in 2008 because she couldn't believe how 'swollen' her faced looked . As a civil engineer with disposable income, Ms Smiles found herself eating out more, traveling for business and indulging at after work happy hours.' 'I wasn't being conscientious of what I was putting in my body,' she said. Within six months Ms Smiles had put on 40lbs in addition to the weight she had gained in college. While she was aware that she was buying clothes in bigger sizes, she didn't have an 'aha moment' until she saw an unflattering photo of herself from a friend's wedding in 2008. 'I couldn't believe how swollen my face looked,' she recalled. Ms Smiles knew her weight was out of control, and it was in her living room that she gradually started to change the shape of her body. When she found herself watching an infomercial for one of Beachbody's many at home fitness programs, she got off of her couch and started doing the exercises from the commercial. Helping hand: Ms Smiles lost weight gradually (left), and when her weight loss plateaued, she hired a personal trainer to whip her into even better shape (right) New priorities: Ms Smiles often ate out and indulged in happy hours after college graduation (left). She now spends her spare time teaching fitness classes and working as a posing coach for other competitors (right) She later ordered the DVD series and worked out in her home until she felt comfortable enough to join 24 Hour Fitness, a local gym. Her first goal was to get down to 145lbs before going on a girls trip to Miami. But Ms Smiles's weight loss was gradual. It took her six months to lose 30lbs. 'It was more about inches at that time,' she said. 'I didn't want to be the fat friend at the beach.' Ms Smiles continued to challenge herself after her weight loss started to plateau. She soon made the decision to become a group fitness instructor. 'This entire a process has always been about working on myself,' she noted. After maintaining a weight of 130lbs for two years, Ms Smiles began working with personal trainer Dewayne Malone. Mr Malone taught her how to balance calories as well as fat and carbohydrates. She lost 7lbs within a week of following his meal plan and training. The Houston trainer encouraged her to enter her first bodybuilding competition in 2012. Not only did Ms Smiles agree to compete, but she came in fourth place. Model teacher: Ms Smiles competed in her first fitness competition in 2012. While she continues to compete, she also helps other competitors with their stage presence . Striving for excellence: Ms Smiles (far right) started teaching group fitness classes at 24 Hour Fitness in order to continue to challenge herself . In 2013, Ms Smiles was 117lbs when she placed first in the open figure division at the Musclemania Superbody competition. While she has weighed as little as 104lbs, she noted it is a weight that is unrealistic for her to maintain. She instead chooses to stay at a healthy 125lbs throughout the year, so she is able to 'cheat' and go out to eat with her son and her friends. Before she starts training for a show, she explained that she indulges in a 'last supper', which is usually at Perry's Steakhouse & Grille. She will then dedicate eight to 12 weeks to '100per cent clean eating' in order to prepare for the competition. Ms Smiles said that one common misconception is that people think they need to starve themselves to lose weight. Slow and steady: Ms Smiles (right) said the hardest part of reaching your goal weight is to maintain your weight loss. She said she has 'changed her relationship with food' and has kept the weight off for six years . Only human: The fitness competitor (right) allows herself to have cheat days when she is not training, so she is able to go out and eat with her family and friends . 'I eat six meals a day,' she said. 'I am always eating.' Because she has changed her relationship with food, she said she has no problem eating the same things over and over again. She quickly rattled off items from her weekly grocery list, which includes oatmeal, egg whites, grape fruit, salmon, tilapia, green beans, Greek yogurt, lean meat and sweet potatoes. And while she can happily eat a salad without dressing, she admitted that she is just like everyone else when it comes to cravings. 'I always try to be a fitness inspiration,' she said, 'but I want to tell people I like cookies like any other person. She added: 'But I know that I can only have a certain amount of cookies... You can have things if you learn how to balance.'","Nichola Smiles, a civil engineer from Texas, weighed 180bs and wore a size 14/16 in 2008 .

"Lord Darzi, one of the country's top surgeons, said it was irrelevant who provided treatment for the NHS - as long as it was good . The growing Labour civil war over the NHS deepened last night after a former health minister attacked proposals to stop private firms being used to provide treatment. Lord Darzi, one of the country's top surgeons, said it was irrelevant who provided treatment for the NHS - as long as it was good. It comes after former Health Secretary Alan Milburn said Labour's attack on NHS competition was a 'fatal mistake' which could cost it the election. Ed Miliband has pledged to repeal the Government health reforms and slash private sector involvement in the NHS. The Labour leader this week claimed he needed to 'rescue the National Health Service' from the Tories. Under Labour's plan, private health firms and charities would only be allowed to provide treatment to 'support' the NHS – for example, if there was sudden increase in waiting times. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham has accused the coalition of putting 'an alien ideology at the heart of the NHS' by making the NHS put all its services out to the market, allowing private companies to bid for contracts to provide treatment. He has refused to say how much he would cut the private sector's involvement in the NHS - but insisted the amount of money spent by the NHS on outsourced treatment was too high. Official figures showed less than 6 per cent of the NHS budget is outsourced to private and not-for-profit sectors. But of this, more than 4.4 per cent of the NHS 'privatisation' happened under Labour – including when Mr Burnham was health secretary. Speaking to BBC Newsnight last night Lord Darzi said the NHS should prefer providers who delivered the highest quality care - whether they are 'public, private or not-for-profit'. He said: 'If the debate doesn't focus on the quality of care, then every patient and every clinician will know that the real argument about what matters has already been lost.' Julian Le Grand, a former senior policy advisor to ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair, and an architect of many Labour health reforms, added that competition within the health service 'seems to work'. He said: 'We learnt in the Blair government that you have to have pressure from outside if you're going to reform a poorly performing hospital. 'That pressure can come from competition. It seems to work, it's a good thing to have and if Andy Burnham ends up pouring more money into the health service without that, that money is going to be wasted.' The NHS outsourced 4.4 per cent of its budget under the Labour party - but less than 2 per cent under the Coalition . On Wednesday, David Cameron accused Labour of being 'completely useless' and accused Mr Miliband of a 'disgraceful' bid to 'weaponising' the NHS to win votes . The Labour leader Ed Miliband said he needed to 'rescue the National Health Service' from the Tories . On Wednesday, David Cameron accused Labour of being 'completely useless' and accused Mr Miliband of a 'disgraceful' bid to 'weaponising' the NHS to win votes. The Prime Minister said Mr Miliband was grasping at straws as he is in a 'desperate mess on the NHS'. Overall, the Coalition has contracted out half as much of the NHS budget to the private sector as Labour did in power. During the four years from 2006/07, Labour outsourced 0.5 per cent of the NHS budget every 12 months, while the Coalition has only contracted out 0.25 per each year. Mr Burnham, appearing on Newsnight earlier this week, insisted Labour only brought in private sector capacity 'to bring down waiting lists'. Under Labour's planned overhaul of the NHS, the NHS would be banned from buying in treatment from private health firms before they had tried to do it themselves. He said: 'I am clear, the market is not the answer to 21st century health and care. If we allow market forces to continue to take hold, they will eventually break the NHS apart.' The shadow health secretary said the coalition had 'put an alien ideology at the heart of the NHS' by making the NHS put all its services out to the market' Labour's Andy Burnham, appearing on Newsnight last night, insisted Labour only brought in private sector capacity 'to bring down waiting lists' Mr Burnham's proposals were slammed by the Blairite former health secretary Alan Milburn. He said: 'You have got a pale imitation of the 1992 general election campaign, and maybe it will have the same outcome, I don't know. 'But it would be a fatal mistake, in my view, for Labour to go into this election looking as though it is the party that will better resource the National Health Service but not necessarily put its foot to the floor when it comes to reforming it.'","Lord Darzi said it did not matter who provided NHS treatment if it was good .

"The chef behind 'the world's greatest restaurant' has launched a pop-up version in Japan, with a tasting menu priced £440 - complete with a surprisingly delicious starter of still-twitching prawns... and ants. Chef Rene Redzepi's two-Michelin-star restaurant in Copenhagen has been voted the best in the world several times and now he has taken his talent to Tokyo. Noma Tokyo recently opened to great fanfare on the 37th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Japan's capital for just five weeks - with two sittings per day. Scroll down for video . Chef Rene Redzepi has taken his talent to Japan, with his pop-up Noma Tokyo offering a 15-course tasting menu that starts with a starter of prawns and ants (pictured) The three-hour and 15-course tasting menu costs 78,529 yen (£440) a head, including wine, taxes and service charge. And due to its success, it is now staying open a further two weeks until Valentine's Day. Perhaps this is thanks to the show-stopping starter, which critics have raved about - live jumbo shrimp served atop a platter of ice 'with a dozen or so tiny wild black ants'. Noma has used ants in dishes before, serving them with beef tartare at the Copenhagen restaurant, and diners in Japan are used to eating live seafood. Adam Pasick, writing for QZ, described the dish as 'jumbo shrimp, so recently killed that they are still twitching, served with about a dozen tiny black ants for seasoning.' Chef Rene Redzepi's (pictured left) restaurant in Copenhagen has been voted the best in the world several times and now he is offering Japanese diners a taste at Noma at the Mandarin Oriental (right) And writing in The Japan Times, reviewer Robbie Swinnerton said: 'They are superb, premium sashimi quality and so fresh they’re still dancing their final quivers. 'But it is the seasoning — “flavors of the Nagano forest” the menu calls it — that defines this dish. 'A dozen tiny wild black ants are carefully arranged on the shrimp, their little pinpricks of sharp acidity acting as a perfect accent for the sweet, pink flesh.' But it's not just the first course that proved a hit - as the reviewer adds that every dish 'is the product of intense, intricate preparation' and a 'radical combination of ingredients'. He adds of the 'prettiest' dishes features slivers of simmered pumpkin paired with salted cherry blossoms' and even the tofu course is a 'revelation'. A reviewer called one dish - slivers of the pumpkin paired with salted cherry blossoms - the prettiest . Danish Chef Rene Redzepi, who won the title World's Best Restaurant with Noma two years in a row, has moved to Japan for a five week stint in Tokyo . Foodies across the planet have been raving about Noma for  years - with more than one dubbing it 'the world's best restaurant'. The restaurant, which is based in Copenhagen, serves Nordic food reimagined under the watchful eye of head chef René Redzepi. Noma's website boasts it is 'hoping to rediscover our history and shape our future' through its food. Diners are offered a 20-course menu, including unusual dishes such as beef tartare and ants, radish and yeast and reindeer moss and cep mushrooms. A meal at the two Michelin-starred restaurant costs around about £166, with wine pairing costing an extra £104. But it is worth it, according to the restaurant critics. Writing for the Daily Mail in 2010, Tom Parker Bowles concluded: 'Noma is utterly and gloriously unique. And quite, quite brilliant.' The Tokyo pop-up is the first time Redzepi and his team have ventured outside Denmark. It opened last Friday, and so far reviews trickling out suggest it will be just as successful in the east.","Rene Redzepi's Copenhagen eatery has been voted the best in the world .

"A top British diplomat was the focus of a secret Government file about his 'unnatural' sexual behaviour, it was revealed today. The file, which has just been released to the National Archives, names the late Sir Peter Hayman as the subject of a file prepared for then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Sir Peter died in 1992 after a career working as a diplomat including as High Commissioner to Canada. He also worked for intelligence service MI6. He was outed as a paedophile in the House of Commons after being let off with a police caution despite being found with a trove of extreme pornographic images which he shared with other child abusers. Sir Peter Hayman, former British diplomat involved in Old Bailey paedophile case . He was named as a child abuser by the campaigning  MP Geoffrey Dickens in the 1980s. He also had links to the controversial Paedophile Information Exchange which campaigned for sex with children to be legalised. The top secret Government file  was retained on grounds of national security and held by officials at the Cabinet Office, until it was finally released by the National Archives today, Sky News reported today. Sir Peter's sickening secret life was discovered in 1978 after police raided a flat he kept secret from his wife where they found child abuse images and post shared with other paedophiles. Among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which Sir Peter had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies, the latter including sex with minors. There was also substantial correspondence with other PIE members — 111 pages in one instance — in which they shared their otherwise secret desires and other graphic paedophile material. Police later found that two of the dozen or so paedophiles in Sir Peter's circle had been writing to each other about their interest in the extreme sexual torture and murder of children. Even the hardened cops of the Obscene Publications Squad were 'revolted' by the Linden Gardens haul, it has been revealed. When interviewed, Sir Peter — a man who had been deputy commandant of the British zone in Berlin and was later tasked to tear a strip off the Soviet ambassador to London after Moscow crushed the Prague Spring of 1968 — broke down and wept. However, he was let off with a caution. The Director of Public Prosecutions deemed that as the paedophile material sent through the post by Sir Peter and his friends had not been 'unsolicited' nor traded for profit, no offence had taken place worthy of prosecution.

Tory peer Lord Brittan was handed a dossier of child sex abuse allegations by the campaigning MP Geoffrey Dickens - who outed Sir Peter Hayman as a paedophile . Sir Peter's reputation remained intact until he was outed in Parliament by the campaigning MP Mr Dickens. The Hayman affair came back into the spotlight last year after Theresa May ordered an investigation into the alleged cover-up of a VIP paedophile ring which included leading figures in Westminster and Whitehall. It came after Labour MP Simon Danczuk raised the matter in the Commons and centres on a dossier of child sex allegations involving senior Establishment figures, which was handed to the then Home Secretary Leon Brittan by fellow Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in November 1983. Lord Brittan said that he passed the documents on to Whitehall officials. But no action was taken and the Home Office has admitted that the Dickens dossier was subsequently destroyed.","Sir Peter Hayman died in 1992 after a career working as a diplomat .

"Explosive claims: Lawrence Wilkerson (pictured), Colin Powell's former chief of staff, said Diego Garcia was used as a 'transit location' for the US government's 'nefarious activities' after 9/11 . Interrogations of terror suspects took place on the British overseas territory of Diego Garcia, according to a senior official in George W Bush's administration. Lawrence Wilkerson said 'nefarious activities' had occurred on the Indian Ocean island, which the UK leases to the US military. And he said it was 'difficult to think' the UK authorities were unaware that detainees were being questioned. The former White House aide's revelations will increase the pressure on David Cameron to order a public inquiry into the extent of Britain's involvement in the CIA's rendition and torture programme. Ministers say the island was used just twice as a refuelling stop for extraordinary rendition flights – where terror suspects are moved to secret prisons for torture. But they insist no detainees set foot on the atoll – a claim now seriously undermined by Mr Wilkerson, who was US secretary of state Colin Powell's chief of staff between 2002 and 2005. He said he received the information about interrogations on Diego Garcia from four well-placed CIA and intelligence sources, including a veteran of the renditions programme and an official who was 'very much plugged in to what was going on at the CIA' after he retired. It is the first time a senior Bush administration official has stated on the record that the remote British territory was a part of the CIA's global network of secret 'black site' prisons. In an interview with Vice News, a website, he said it was known as a place to get things done 'out of the limelight'. 'No one has indicated there was a detention site there, not in so many words,' said Mr Wilkerson. 'What they indicated is that interrogations took place there.' He said there was no permanent detention facility on the outcrop, but added: 'What I heard was more along the lines of using it as a transit location when perhaps other places were full or other places were deemed too dangerous or insecure, or unavailable. 'So you might have a case where you simply go in and use a facility at Diego Garcia for a month, or two weeks, or whatever, and you do your nefarious activities there. 'It's difficult for me to think that we could do anything there of any duration to speak of without the British knowing – at least the British on the island – knowing what we were doing. That doesn't mean London knew.' Lawrence Wilkerson was Colin Powell's (left) former chief of staff during the George Bush (right) administration . The Army veteran, who served on the island during the 1980s, added: 'A general theme I heard was that the British were very cooperative with everything.' Number 10 is already facing accusations that ministers pressed the US Senate intelligence committee to redact any reference to Diego Garcia from its damning report into torture.Lord Goldsmith, who was Tony Blair's top legal adviser, has said he has 'no recollection' of whether discussions took place over using Diego Garcia as a black site. Manfred Nowak, the United Nations' former special envoy on torture, has said he had been told detainees were held on Diego Garcia in 2002 and 2003. Cori Crider, a director at human rights charity Reprieve said: 'This suggests the UK Government has not told the whole truth. 'Ministers have consistently claimed only two CIA rendition victims ever landed on Diego Garcia – Lawrence Wilkerson's comments suggest that either they haven't been honest with the public, or the US government hasn't been honest with them.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'The US government has assured us that, apart from the two cases in 2002, there have been no other instances in which US intelligence flights landed in the UK, our overseas territories, or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 September, 2001.' Diego Garcia is midway between East Africa and the southern tip of Asia and was leased by Britain to the United States, which turned it into a vast military base . Wilkerson, 70, did not learn about what was happening on Diego Garcia (pictured) until after he left office . The island is midway between East Africa and the southern tip of Asia and was leased by Britain to the U.S., which turned it into a vast military base. Wilkerson said he thinks it's unlikely the British military personnel on Diego Garcia had not noticed the arrival and departure of prisoners. The UK government claims only two rendition flights have passed through the island when they stopped to refuel in 2002. Cori Crider, a director at London-based human rights charity Reprieve, said: 'This suggests the UK Government has not told the whole truth about Diego Garcia's part in the CIA's torture programme. 'Ministers have consistently claimed only two CIA rendition victims ever landed on Diego Garcia – Lawrence Wilkerson's comments suggest that either they haven't been honest with the public, or the US government hasn't been honest with them.'

"The woman behind a campaign which has seen more than £50,000 donated for a disabled pensioner who was attacked outside his home says she felt compelled to act when she heard about the sickening crime. Alan Barnes - who was born with growth problems and is now partially sighted, weighs just six stone and is 4ft 6in tall - was knocked to the ground as he put his bin outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. When local resident Katie Cutler heard about the shocking attack - which left Mr Barnes with a broken collar bone - she set up a fund to help the 67-year-old. The Alan Barnes Fund on website Go Fund Me has now reached £50,000 with donations of up to £1,000-a-time coming in from around the world. Partially-sighted Alan Barnes was left with a broken collar bone after he was attacked by a mugger outside his home. Well-wishers have now donated £50,000 to a fund set up to help his recovery set up by Katie Cutler . Ms Cutler, 21, also from Gateshead, said: 'I had just put my daughter to bed when I came across Alan's story on Wednesday night and I was really upset by what I had read. 'Alan obviously can't defend himself and he must have been so afraid. He comes across as such a quiet, timid, man and I can't imagine how this must have affected him. 'I wanted to do something to help so I went online to set up a fundraising page. I had heard that he was too afraid to go back to his old house so I thought raising a few hundred pound might help him to find somewhere new. 'Now that the total has gone up over £20,000 I'm lost for words, it just shows how lovely people can be. Ms Cutler, who runs her own beauticians, 'With Love Gracie', named after her two-year-old, added: 'I have hardly slept since I set the page up because my phone is buzzing all the time with donations pouring in. 'It's so awful what has happened to Alan and I hope that the donations do keep coming so that he can experience something positive from this horrible experience. Ms Cutler says she has been amazed by the amounts people have been willing to donate . 'I am sure that the police will catch whoever did this and they will be brought to justice.' When told about the fund, Mr Barnes said: 'I would really just like to say thank you to everyone, I really didn't expect it. 'When I was told about the fund, I was totally surprised as I didn't expect anything like that. I'm so grateful and I just want to say a big thank you, it's such a lovely thing to do. 'I have heard of people setting up funds for charities but not just for what happened to me. I'm overwhelmed and I just want to say thank you.' More than 2,000 people have donated using the page, many of whom left messages of support for Mr Barnes. Nadeem Inayat wrote on the donation page: 'I was very upset to have read that such a defenceless and frail old man was left feeling afraid to go back to his home that for all intents and purposes should be his haven and source of safety. 'I hope someone reads some of these comments to Alan and let him know that he is a very much loved man.' Frail Mr Barnes was pushing his bin from the back of his home to the front at around 6.30pm on Sunday night when he was targeted. He was knocked to the ground, breaking his collar bone as he landed. The mugger demanded money and searched Mr Barnes' pockets before realising his stricken victim was not carrying cash and fleeing. Mr Barnes stumbled to the house next door where his neighbour called his sister Carol Hill, who rushed over and took her brother to hospital, where X-rays revealed the fractured collar bone. Mr Barnes, a committed Christian, said: 'Someone just jumped on me. It all happened in a very short time. I would like to see him caught because he might do it again. 'I didn't see him coming. He must have jumped on me from a back garden. 'He pushed me down and put his hands in my pockets, then told me to give him my money, but I didn't have any. 'I shouted 'help' and then he ran off. As soon as he had gone I got up, and I knew I had been hurt.' Mr Barnes's broken collar-bone will take nearly two months to heal, in which time he will need special care. He added: 'I'm just frustrated now that I can't do anything for myself. They say it will take four to six weeks for me to recover. 'I'm trying to do the best I can. I can manage to get a bath if someone puts the water in. But I can't tie my shoelaces.' Ms Hill is furious that anyone would stoop so low as to attack her frail brother. The 55-year-old said: 'The police seem to think it was a random opportunist attack. But they must have seen Alan as an easy target. 'I was furious. Whoever has done this has no morals at all to attack someone so vulnerable.' Mr Barnes is well known in the area around his home and is an active member of the congregation at his local Methodist church. He fills his days taking long walks around the area. He is known as a skilled mathematician and impresses youngsters by being able to quickly work out exactly how many days a person has been alive after finding out when they were born. Mr Barnes is now too frightened to return to his home, and Ms Hill is helping her brother look for new accommodation. His sister believes he was targeted because he is an 'easy target'. Police are appealing for information . Detectives hunting the would-be robber have branded the crime 'disgraceful'. Det Con Chris Neil, of Gateshead CID, said: 'This was a cowardly assault on a vulnerable man who wasn't able to defend himself. 'His disability means he is partially sighted and quite short and it's disgraceful that someone would target him. 'The victim is quite a well-known man in the area and this has left him extremely distressed. 'We're doing everything we can to trace the suspect and I would urge anyone who saw this attempted robbery or who has information about the person responsible to get in touch.' Locals have launched a fund to help Mr Barnes and have so far raised more than £1,400, which they plan to give to the pensioner to make his house more secure or to help him move home. Anyone with any information should target Northumbria Police quoting log number 1180 25/01/15 or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Alan Barnes, 67, has suffered growth and sight problems since birth .

"Her fitness DVD has become the fastest-selling of all time but Charlotte Crosby has admitted she hasn't always loved exercising. The 24-year-old Geordie Shore star appeared on today's This Morning to share the secrets to her success after she has shed two-and-a-half stone in seven months. She believes if she can drop four dresses sizes, anyone can - as she wasn't a healthy eater or gym bunny before her recent health kick. Scroll down for video . Charlotte Crosby admitted she used to drink pints of Baileys on today's This Morning . Transformation: Eamonn Holmes brought out a cardboard cutout of how the reality star used to look before she shed two-and-a-half stone through diet and exercise . 'I've changed my lifestyle to be healthier. I still drink but I've cut it down, I used to have pints of Baileys, I loved it,' she told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. The Irish cream has 13g of fat per 100ml so cutting pints of it from her diet has made a huge difference to her waistline, along with eating a diet lower in fat. The reality TV star from Sunderland said exercise was also a key factor in helping her go from a dress size 16 to 8. She said learning to love keeping fit was a challenge as she'd always felt self-conscious when working out. The fitness DVD has become the fastest selling in the UK since its Boxing Day release . She said: 'Before I didn't do any exercise. I did not want to go to gym, I felt intimated as I didn't know what I was doing and I felt like people were staring at me.' But since teaming up with personal trainer Richard Callender, Charlotte has transformed both her body and her mindset. She said: 'The exercise was difficult at first but I'm so strong now, I could carry you both on my back,' she joked to the presenters. The workouts Charlotte does with Richard and her eating plan, devised by weight loss expert David Souter, is revealed on her DVD 'Charlotte Crosby's 3 Minute Belly Blitz' which has become a huge success. Charlotte, pictured with ex-boyfriend Gaz Beadle on Celebrity Wedding Planner, will be reunited with him again on Ex On The Beach. He's yet to comment on her new figure . The Official Chart Company revealed earlier this month that it has become the UK's fastest-selling fitness DVD of all time following its Boxing Day release. Charlotte said she's delighted with the sales and hopes it can help other people get into shape like she did. She said: 'I can't believe it's fastest selling fitness DVD, I'm so proud and happy to be inspiration to people.' But while Eamonn and Ruth were quick to praise Charlotte's new figure - bringing out a cardboard cutout of the 'big old you' to compare her size - she said not everyone has showered her with compliments. 'I don't know Gaz's reaction,' she said of her ex-boyfriend Gaz Beadle, with whom she's had a stormy on-off relationship on Geordie Shore. 'He never tells us out of spite, I think,' she revealed, 'He doesn't want to give me a compliment.' The pair will be reunited on the new series of MTV reality show Ex On The Beach.","Geordie Shore star has shed two-and-a-half-stone .

"Catherine Mayer's book (pictured) is set to be released next Thursday . A picture of one of the world’s ‘least understood figures’ emerges in a new biography of Prince Charles. It quotes actress Emma Thompson, a close friend, as saying: ‘We talk a lot about the guilt of privilege. Sometimes I think he’s driven by guilt.’ It describes Charles as a prince who will ‘never be remote and silent like his mother’ and is driven to improve the human condition. He’s quoted as saying: ‘I want to raise aspirations and recreate hope from hopelessness and health from deprivation.’ Author Catherine Mayer talks of a prince who ‘rarely recognises his own achievements’ and is described by one of his inner circle as ‘a glass-half-empty man’, a ‘Prince of Wails’. Another close figure talks of Charles’s temper. ‘The royal rage, I call it. Here comes the royal rage.’ Ms Mayer discovered a man whose despondency, she said, ‘has been profound’ at the darkest moments in his life. Prince Charles confided to her: ‘Each thing I did, you had to meet another lot of people who have all sorts of views of you beforehand, all sorts of prejudices.’ The private Charles, however, may have a luxury lifestyle but, says former private secretary Clive Alderton: ‘When you are having tea with him, (he) gets any leftovers wrapped up and brought back for his next meal, and the next one. I’ve rarely met someone who is so frugal, not in the sense of meanness but an absolute allergy to waste, and in particular waste of food.’ Nor is this frugality confined to his eating habits. In the biography, Ms Mayer (editor at large for Time magazine) reveals how, one hot summer, he syphoned dirty water through a pipe from his bath at St James’s Palace onto his garden below. Of course, there is, as ever, a fundamental contradiction in such behaviour. The book says: ‘He lives high on the hog . . . but combines the showiness of royal life — the banquets, the acreage of cut flowers, retinues larger than most other family members employ — with a frugality absorbed from his parents and from the austere schooling at Gordonstoun, and more consciously informed by his environmental concerns.’ Ms Mayer describes him wanting to be King as ‘the least of his ambitions’ but, confusingly, goes on to say he is ‘gnawingly impatient’ to accede to the throne. Yet he is said to ‘dread’ the death of his parents, and still mourns ‘with a startlingly raw grief’ his grandmother (the Queen Mother), his great-uncle Earl Mountbatten (murdered by the IRA) and his guru Sir Laurens van der Post. On a lighter note, some of Charles’s staff refer to wealthy dinner guests who the Prince entertains in return for their donations to his worthy causes as ‘Bond villains’. And a member of his household at Clarence House reveals there is a competition there ‘to see how deep you can curtsey without falling over’. Ben Elliot, Camilla’s nephew, describes Charles as warm and ‘extraordinarily tactile’. The Prince, we learn, made the tea at the family gathering after the funeral of Camilla’s adventurer brother Mark Shand last May. Extracts of the book, Charles: The Heart Of A King, have been released on Kindle in advance publication. Here he is pictured with Camilla (second from left), Prince William (left) and Prince Harry (right) Charles is revealed also to organise surprise parties for friends and people he admires — one of these being a joint 80th birthday party at Clarence House for the playwright Sir Ronald Harwood and the actress Dame Maggie Smith. Extracts of the book, Charles: The Heart Of A King, have been released on Kindle in advance of publication next Thursday. The publisher boasts that Ms Mayer’s work is ‘based on exclusive interviews with members of the Prince’s inner circle and underpinned by rare direct access to the Prince himself’. It is believed she has interviewed the Prince and more than 50 of his friends, family confidantes and staff. Ms Mayer says her access to him included trailing him for six months, ‘struggling to keep up as he strode across muddy fields’, and she dined with him at Dumfries House in Scotland. The Prince’s cousin Tim Knatchbull (whose twin brother, Nicholas, was killed aged 14 by the same bomb that blew up Lord Mountbatten) describes Charles as ‘an expert mimic . . . a sort of Rory Bremner . . . ’ Although ‘fundamentally serious’, Charles is seen as a natural comic. One of his favourite gags involves instructions given to air passengers afraid of being marooned on a desert island. The advice begins with them being told always to make sure they’ve got a cocktail shaker and the means of making a martini. The punch-line centres on the moment they start to mix the drink — ‘I can guarantee within a minute someone will jump out of a tree and say: “That’s not the proper way to mix a martini!” ’ Prince Charles shares a joke with Prince Harry. Charles is said to be a natural comic and he has a number of favourite gags . His delight in the absurd was witnessed at Prince Harry’s 13th birthday party, when he was ‘laughing uproariously while competing with Emma Thompson in a game in which players donned hats covered in Velcro to try to catch felt-covered balls’. Incidentally, Ms Thompson is also quoted as saying that dancing with Charles was ‘better than sex’. If Ms Mayer has the right birthday for Harry, and the party took place on the day itself, it would have been just 16 days after Princess Diana’s death. In what she calls her ‘fundamental reappraisal’ of Charles and Diana’s marriage, Ms Mayer concludes that in the so-called War of the Waleses, the Prince ‘could never match Diana’s lustre or her blood-lust’. She concludes with a rather unfortunate tribute, saying Charles III ‘promises to be as memorable a king as Charles I’ — who, of course, was the only English monarch ever to be executed.","Catherine Mayer's book Prince Charles set to be released next Thursday .

"A flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas was forced to make an emergency landing today after the captain was accidentally locked out of the cockpit. Officials at McCarran International Airport received a distress call from the Delta Air Lines flight at about 12.10pm after the cockpit door malfunctioned when the pilot tried to return to the controls. Scroll down for video . A Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas was forced to make an emergency landing today after the pilot was locked out of the cockpit (stock image) 'About half way through [the 2.5-hour flight] there seemed to be some talking at the front of the plane. You could see the captain out there,' passenger Jesse Dougherty told ABC News. 'There wasn't a huge panic but some confusion.' The captain explained the situation to the 168 people on board and they reportedly broke out into spontaneous applause when the plane landed safely with the first officer at the controls. The plane's first officer was forced to make an 'unassisted landing' and did so successfully at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas; those on board were said to have applauded as the plane landed . No one was injured in the emergency landing, which took place at McCarran International Airport at around 12.25pm. The first officer landed the Md-90 aircraft using the controls at his seat as he was more familiar with the layout. However, the first officer's seat doesn't allow access to the plane's taxi controls so the aircraft had to be towed from the runway to the gate, according to passenger Dougherty. Airport spokesman Christine Crews said the first officer completed an 'unassisted landing' which was taken 'very seriously'. She said: 'This was an unusual landing. He called the airport so that we would have ground response available.'","Captain left the cockpit during the flight leaving the first officer in charge .

"A distasteful obituary published by The Australian about best-selling Australian author Colleen McCullough sent furious Twitter users into a frenzy on Friday. Hundreds of people took to social media early on in the day to express their disgust at the sexist opening paragraph of the publication's tribute to the The Thorn Birds writer, which read 'plain of feature, and certainly overweight, she was, nevertheless, a woman of wit and warmth'. This was followed by what has been slammed as an irrelevant quote from the internationally renowned author, who wrote 24 novels and a biography in her 40 year career: 'In one interview, she said: 'I've never been into clothes or figure and the interesting thing is I never had any trouble attracting men.'

"Alex Salmond has boasted that a Tory attack poster featuring him and Ed Miliband outside Number 10 will backfire because he is more popular than David Cameron – even in England. The former First Minister said he was 'definitely less unpopular' than the Prime Minister south of the border and predicted the SNP would hold the balance of power after the election. The remarks come after Mr Salmond's successor as First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said having the SNP in power would be good for the whole of Britain – and boasted that she would order Scottish MPs to vote on laws which only apply in England. Former First Minister said he was 'definitely less unpopular' than the Prime Minister south of the border . Mr Salmond, who is standing for Parliament in the Aberdeenshire seat of Gordon, said his 'part in history' was yet to be written – but insisted Ms Sturgeon would be in charge of any Coalition negotiations with Labour. 'Anyone who knows Nicola knows she won't let me be a backseat driver,' he told Buzzfeed News. Mr Salmond insisted he was happy in his new role as the 'bogeyman of the British establishment'. But he said: 'There's every chance of the SNP becoming the third biggest party in the UK in May. 'The political stars are aligning for a balanced parliament. Neither Cameron or Miliband are capable or deserve a majority, and that leaves space for a hugely substantial SNP influence. The Conservative Party last week released an election poster raising the 'nightmare' prospect of Mr Salmond propping up a Labour Government in Coalition. But the SNP heavyweight said: 'The problem for the Tories, and Labour for that matter, is that I'm certainly more popular than David Cameron and Ed Miliband in England. 'Definitely less unpopular, anyway, let's put it that way.' He said Mr Cameron had let the Chancellor George Osborne become too powerful and dismissed the Labour leader as a 'less than outstanding politician'. The Tories released an election poster last week showing Alex Salmond and Ed Miliband outside Number 10 with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams . Mr Salmond also revealed that he is still unable to shake hands with members of the public because he seriously damaged his elbow greeting so many people during the referendum campaign. He became so downhearted after losing the referendum he gave up his 5:2 diet – where you fast on just 600 calories two days a week. He told Buzzfeed: 'I'm back on it now. I had a break – that diet and losing the referendum would have been a bit much.' But the Scottish nationalist is also telling disappointed 'yes' voters that there will still be 'another chance' of winning independence.","Former First Minister said he was 'definitely less unpopular' than the PM .

"Google has been forced to change its privacy rules after it was rapped across the knuckles for illegally leaving people in the dark about how their personal details were collected and used. Britain’s data protection watchdog said the internet search giant was ‘too vague’ about the vast amounts of information being gathered about web users. The firm has agreed rewrite its policies to make it easier for internet users to find out how their data was hoovered up and stored after pressure from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Google has been ordered to rewrite its privacy policy after data protection watchdog ordered it to make its guidelines clearer, after deeming them 'too vague' and 'baffling' for ordinary people . The development comes two years after the ICO ruled the company’s guidelines must be overhauled because they were baffling and did not comply with UK laws. Google had faced a fine of up to £500,000 or a court order – but now Kent Walker, the firm’s senior vice-president, has signed a formal undertaking that it would begin making the changes by June 30. Privacy campaigners have raised serious concerns about the way online companies, particularly search engines and social media sites such as Facebook, collect and use data about their customers. The regulator - along with its continental counterparts - began looking into Google after its controversial privacy policy update in March 2012. Separate documents on how Google would use data collected from each of its 70 websites, including YouTube and G-Mail, were condensed into a single file. But the ICO said the details were watered down, and ordinary people would have no idea after reading the file how their personal details, such as email addresses or website viewing history, would be used by Google. The company, which owns YouTube and G-Mail, has signed a formal undertaking that it would begin making the changes by June 30 . Now the company has vowed to provide ‘unambiguous and comprehensive information regarding data processing, including an exhaustive list of the types of data processed by Google and the purposes for which data is processed’. The watchdog said the new agreement would have an impact not just on Google but also on other companies which gather information online. Steve Eckersley, the ICO’s head of enforcement, said the undertaking marked a ‘significant step forward’. He said: ‘Whilst our investigation concluded that this case hasn’t resulted in substantial damage and distress to consumers, it is still important for organisations to properly understand the impact of their actions and the requirement to comply with data protection law.’ Renate Samson, chief executive of privacy campaigners Big Brother Watch, said: ‘As more of our lives are connected online clearly understanding where our data is being used, who can gain access and what level of control we have over our privacy and security is vital. Changing terms and conditions, so they are accessible and easy to understand is a critical part of our ongoing relationship with technology companies.’ A Google spokesman said: ‘We’re pleased that the ICO has decided to close its investigation. We have agreed improvements to our privacy policy and will continue to work constructively with the Commissioner and his team in the future.’ In July 2013, Google provoked fury when it admitted failing to destroy all sensitive information stolen from unsecured home computers by its Street View cars - harvested from millions of unsuspecting UK households . It came after it was discovered that personal data had been deliberately downloaded from wi-fi networks using sophisticated equipment in the vehicles.","Information Commissioner's Office ruled Google guidelines are 'baffling'

"They are usually considered the preserve of students and are stacked high with bunk beds in huge dormitories. But the world of hostels is changing, with stylish design, historic buildings and even private rooms offered in return for a budget stay. In fact, the competition to be the most cutting-edge accommodation is so fierce that an awards has been created just to gauge the best hostels in the world - the Hoscars. The Bounce hostel in Sydney, Australia ranked highly in the 'Hoscar' Awards for its incredible rooftop terrace overlooking the city . Who says budget sleeping quarters can't be beautiful? The City Backpackers Hostel in Stockholm (left) and the Banana Hostel in Taipei (right) beg to differ . Run by booking site Hostelworld.com, the awards recognise the stunning budget properties around the world, judging them on categories including value for money, location, atmosphere, facilities, security, character and cleanliness. One million travellers decided the results, with some unusual properties receiving recognition, from one that aims to feel like the family home to another inspired by bananas. The categories are broken down into size of the property, as well as continent, country and city picks, but what was particularly surprising this year was Asia's rise to prominence.

Though Southeast Asia has long been a popular destination for backpackers, hostels in Asia increased their share in the Hoscar awards by 16 per cent this year, with Japan taking home six awards. One such favourite is the Banana Hostel in Taiwan, which actually won two Hoscars this year, due to its quirky design aesthetic. Catering to millennials with a taste for industrial-chic spaces on a budget, the hotel certainly lives up to its name - fresh bananas are provided every morning and home-made banana bread every weekend. At the Banana Hostel in Taiwan, which won two Hoscar Awards this year, fresh bananas are provided every morning and home-made banana bread is freshly baked on weekends .

"US Secretary of State John Kerry has been fined for failing to shovel snow outside his home after a major winter storm hit America's north east. City officials hit the one-time candidate for president with a $50 penalty for not clearing the sidewalk outside his mansion in Louisburg Square, Boston. The fine was handed to the globe-trotting 71-year-old after a blizzard dumped two feet of snow on his city this week. US Secretary of State John Kerry has been fined for failing to shovel snow outside his home after a major winter storm hit America's north east . City officials hit the one-time candidate for president with a $50 penalty for not clearing the sidewalk outside his mansion in Louisburg Square, Boston (pictured) Boston Mayor Martin Walsh had vowed to crack down on anyone who left the sidewalks in front of their homes and businesses buried in snow. Officials tagged Kerry with a $50 fine at 9:45am on Thursday for failing to clear up on the Pinckney Street side of his home, it has been reported. Kerry was in Saudi Arabia earlier this week attending the funeral of King Abdullah with President Obama. It was one of 210 snow-removal citations issued on Thursday, the Boston Herald reported. The newspaper said another resident reported the un-shovelled snow to the Inspectional Services Department and that the official who dealt with the case 'did not know' that it was Kerry's mansion.

Worrying outlook: A forecast shows snow engulfing large swathes of New England towards New York and Northern Michigan on Friday . The Herald carries a statement from Kerry's office which read: 'Diplomats — they’re just like us. Secretary Kerry was working overseas while the blizzard packed a wallop back home, and unfortunately his snow removal company misconstrued yellow hazard tape along the sidewalk — put up to warn of falling snow and ice overhead — as police tape and thought that part of the sidewalk was off limits. 'Once they understood they were allowed to enter the area the contractors finished the sidewalk late (this) morning. The snow has all been shoveled now, the Secretary will gladly pay the ticket, and let’s hope this is the last blizzard of the year.' But forecasters have warned that New England is expected to be hit with storm-force winds and up to 18 inches of snow today. A heavy storm warning has been issued for Maine and parts of New Hampshire and Massachusetts north of Boston from this morning through to Saturday night. Residents have been told to travel only in emergencies. The National Weather Service said drifting snow driven by strong winds could make travel life-threatening. Efforts to clear the 3 feet of snow that fell earlier this week have been put on hold.","Officials fine John Kerry for failing to clear snow from outside his mansion .

"There are said to be around 6,500 spoken languages around the world.

In many instances, it shows how Latin formed the basis for modern-day languages, particularly in Europe. Typing the English word ‘cat’ reveals how many French speakers there are across the central band of countries in Africa, including Mali and Chad. In both Spanish and Portuguese, the translation is ‘gato’, and the coloured lines highlight how Spanish dominates South America, with the exception of Brazil. And how Portuguese is isolated in southern Africa in Mozambique. In terms of the number of speakers and dominance, Spanish is the most prominent language in Spain. Portuguese is universal in Portugal, but there are dialects in the south and central regions, including the dialect of Lisbon. The etymology of the word cat is said to come from a Late Egyptian word čaute, and was introduced in around the first century BC. Across Europe, 'cat', or 'catt', comes from the Latin 'cattus' and Byzantine Greek 'κάττα'. From here, it was introduced to many European languages. There is a noticeable difference in how the majority of Nordic countries write their translated version of 'cat', where the ‘c’ is replaced by a ‘k’, and how the word varies more across this region. Typing the English word ‘cat’ reveals how many French speakers there are across the central band of countries in Africa, including Mali and Chad. In both Spanish and Portuguese, the translation is ‘gato’, and this highlights how Spanish dominates South America, with the exception of Brazil. It also shows how Portuguese is isolated in southern Africa in Mozambique . The translations of the word ‘love’ are more varied. In French, Spanish and Italian, for example, it is shown as ‘aimer’, ‘amar’ and ‘amare’. It differs in Catalan, however, where it becomes ‘estimar. ’In Dutch, love translates as ‘liefde’, and German’s say ‘lieben.’ But further north it becomes ‘elsker’ and ‘alskar’. Meanwhile, in Russia as well as Belarus, Turkmeninstan and Ukraine, the word translates as ‘любовь’ For example, from the UK to the east, into Belgium, Germany, Bulgaria and Turkey the word evolves from ‘cat’ to ‘kat’ to ‘katze’ to ‘Котка’ to ‘kedi’ respectively. The map also shows the range of scripts in the Middle East and into Asia from Urdu to Hindi in India, Nepal’s Nepali and Thai. ‘Taxi’ is ‘taxi’ in many languages (Spanish highlighted.) It is shortened from ‘taximeter’, a tool used to measure distances and fares, and 'cabriolet' that refers to a horse-drawn carriage. Taximeter comes from Latin for ‘taxa’, meaning ‘tax’ The Word Map plots the official languages in each country, and doesn’t necessarily reflect the dominance of other languages in that region. For instance, Mandarin Chinese has the most native speakers around the world, but is only the official language of China and Taiwan, as well as one of four official languages of Singapore. Australia is listed as having no official language, although English is considered the as the national language of the country. Translations of the word ‘love’ are more varied. From the Old English ‘lufu’, the word has a Germanic origin, and from an Indo-European root it is shared with Sanskrit ‘lubhyati’ for ‘desires’, Latin’s ‘libet’, which translates into ‘it is pleasing’, as well as libido. While the Latin verb for ‘to love’ is 'amare'. These differences are seen in the way the word changes as the map moves around the world. In French, Spanish and Italian, for example, it is shown as ‘aimer’, ‘amar’ and ‘amare’. It differs in Catalan, however, where it becomes ‘estimar.’ In Dutch, love translates as ‘liefde’, and German’s say ‘lieben.’ But further north it becomes ‘elsker’ and ‘alskar’. Meanwhile, in Russia as well as Belarus, Turkmeninstan and Ukraine, the word translates as ‘любовь’ Of all the languages of Russia, Russian is the only official language. But, there are 35 different languages which are considered official languages in various regions of Russia, along with Russian. According to the map, Arabic is the official language of 21 countries, including Syria, Yemen and Oman. It belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family, and in this language and script the word science is translated into علم. The English word 'science' originated in Middle English and has links with Old French and Latin ‘scientia’, from scire which means ‘know’. The noun 'ciencia' in Spanish translates to science, as well as erudition and knowledge. The English word 'science' originated in Middle English and has links with Old French and Latin ‘scientia’, from scire which means ‘know’. The noun cicencia in Spanish translates to science, as well as erudition and knowledge. In German, the word translates to ‘wissenschaft’, where ‘wissen’ means knowledge and ‘schaft’ is a suffix used to denote that the word is feminine. In Finnish, science is ‘tiede’ The map also reveals that despite its vast size, the official language of the US, as well as Hawaii, is English, or American English.

The two ‘national’ languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish. The official minority languages are three Sami languages, Romani, Finnish Sign Language and the Karelian language. Elsewhere, the word ‘internet’ is a portmanteau of the English words ‘inter’, for reciprocal or mutual, and ‘net’ for network. The technology was described in a paper in 1974, but the term is widely accepted as being coined in 1986 by the US Defense Department. Considered a proper noun by many, the word is often capitalised, but the term has become so widespread - and is often used interchangeably with the word web - that many people use it as a noun instead. As a result, the word hasn’t been translated globally, and as the map shows, is written as ‘internet’ in the various scripts. There are differences between the internet, and the web, namely that the internet is the network that connects computers and devices, while the web is used to move content around this network. However, the two terms are widely used to mean the same thing nowadays. Similarly, the English word ‘taxi’ is ‘taxi’ in many countries. This is because it shortened from ‘taximeter’ and ‘cabriolet’.

"An Alberta man whose German shepherd named Dozer was snatched from his backyard spent a year and a half searching for the pooch before finally giving up. But when Richard Brower of Lethbridge finally decided to look for a new dog online, the search was much shorter. After 18 months of heartache, Brower's own dog was the first one he found himself face-to-face with at his computer. Distraught: Richard Brower of Lethbridge, Alberta searched for 18 months after his beloved German shepherd Dozer was stolen . 'The very first thing I saw was a huge picture of Dozer, and my heart stopped,' Brower told Globalnews.ca. Up until that point, Brower had searched high and low for the 125-pound dog. He'd enlisted his motorcycle riding friends to comb the neighborhood and all but shook down every German shepherd owner he stumbled across, all for naught. 'It's the closest thing to a miracle in my life,' he told CNN. Dozer had been stolen from Brower's backyard, but not from his heart. Nonetheless, the time had recently come for Brower to get a new companion. 'I never gave up hope,' Brower said, 'I'd just come to the realization that I couldn't go on without another dog.' Unbelievable: Miraculously, the first time he searched the internet for German shepherds after deciding to get a new dog, he was led to a picture of Dozer . 'It's the closest thing to a miracle in my life,' said Brower . Found: Dozer was stolen out of Brower's yard but now Brower says he's glad he searched hopefully all those 18 months . After his startling discovery of Dozer at the Claresholm Animal Rescue Society site, he showed the photo to his family. Brower's father was on his way home from a business trip when he stopped at the shelter--which is in a town 50 miles from Brower's home--to investigate. After a couple of quick tests, Brower's dad determined it was Dozer. Staff at Claresholm said they'd picked up Dozer as he was running along a highway nearly an hour from where Brower lives. 'My dad was bawling, I was bawling on the phone,' he said. And when Dozer came home 'he came flying in, put his head into my arm and started doing that wailing that German shepherds do.' All those months of holding out hope had paid off for Brower. 'It's the closest thing to a miracle in my life,' he said.","Richard Brower of Lethbridge, Alberta was so heartbroken by the loss of his dog that he searched for a year and a half before deciding to get a new dog .

At the end of the third quarter of 2014, Wimp said it had 512,000 paying users in Germany, Poland and the Nordic countries. That is a far cry from its Nordic rival Spotify, a pioneer in the streaming music business. The unlisted company boasted 15 million paying subscribers in mid-January and is available in 58 countries. Norwegian business daily Dagens Naeringsliv reported that Jay Z's company was particularly interested in Wimp's high-fidelity Tidal streaming service which is being launched on the US market. 'The Wimp/Tidal service has the potential for greatness, given that it has high-end audio capabilities,' music specialist Simon Dyson at corporate analytics firm Ovum told AFP in an email, adding that the $56-million price tag was 'not excessive'.

"The world's oldest set of sisters have proved they are still young at heart as they celebrate reaching the landmark combined age of 386. As Lillian Brown turned 103 on 23 January, she joked that she and her siblings - twins Dorothy Thompson and Ellen George, 96, and 'baby' of the family Sylvia Sturgess, 91 - would go clubbing. The sisters, whose maiden name is Clarke, were raised in Northampton by their Victorian parents. Lillian Brown (centre) turned 103 on January 23 and with the combined ages of her sisters Sylvia Sturgess, 91 (right) and twins Dorothy Thompson (left) and Ellen George (not pictured), 96, are the world's oldest sisters . Incredibly, between them they have lived through 19 Prime Ministers, five monarchs and survived two world wars. They have a total of six children, 14 grandchildren, 19 great-grandchildren and even one great-great-grandchild. Three of the siblings, Lillian, Dorothy and Sylvia, all live in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, while Ellen lives 17 miles away in Northampton. The lively pensioners also had a fifth sister called Gladys Merritt who died aged 85 in 2000 - and their mother Ellen Clarke lived until she was 102.

Sylvia and Dorothy pictured in Northampton in 1939 . Lillian, who is known as Ann, celebrated her 103rd birthday at the home she shares with her only daughter Valerie Harrison, 75. Lillian said that the secret to longevity was to remain positive and enjoy life. She said: 'We just don't think about dying, just being cheerful and carrying on. 'We enjoy the odd tipple and always have a glass of wine whenever we meet up for a bit of a do.' Lillian added that her age may make her less agile than she once was but she's still happy. 'I've lost my independence and I do get a bit bored but apart from that, I'm quite happy to be 103.' Lillian's daughter, Valerie, said she believed the sprightly sisters had all lived so long because they are 'feisty' women. 'They were talking about all going on to a nightclub after the party but they didn't do that in the end,' she said. 'They all worked independently. My mother's husband died when he was 40, so she took on the business herself. 'Then they're all very feisty and they speak their mind. They don't mince their words. 'And thirdly, they're all quite happy-go-lucky. They've all had sadness in their lives, but they always pick themselves up and get going again.' The five sisters before Gladys' death in 2000 (l-r) Ellen, Gladys, Dorothy, Lillian and Sylvia . Sylvia and Dorothy both live independently in the same sheltered housing block of flats near their sister Lillian's home in Market Harborough. And the fourth sister Ellen, who wasn't able to make the birthday party, also lives independently in a retirement block in Northampton. When they were younger, twins Dorothy and Ellen both worked in fashion and at clothing shops while Sylvia was a housewife. Lillian took over in business from her husband when he died aged just 40 and ran a pub as well as a greengrocers before going into property development. Lillian says that despite her age making her less agile she is still thoroughly enjoying life . Dorothy's daughter Carolyn Boddington, 67, said her mother and Auntie Sylvia still go out for a pub lunch together twice a week. The retired admin worker, who lives nearby in Desborough, Northamptonshire, added that none of the women had let their age prevent them from having fun. 'They are all very independent, they all have quite forceful personalities. 'Their mother was the driving force behind the family and I think they have just followed on from her. 'They enjoy their life and they are very determined to carry on living to the full. 'My mother and Sylvia still get a taxi and go out for a pub lunch twice a week, they like a good tipple. 'They are quite thrilled about the record, the family are used to them being around but it is quite an achievement.' The previous title for the world's oldest living siblings belonged to Jack Stepham, Clara Goldsmith, Belle Dell and Anne Goldsmith from the Stepham family in the UK. Their combined age stood at 388 years before Jack, 94, was killed in September 2011. The death means the Clarke sisters, whose combined age is 386, are the oldest living siblings in the world and they are now waiting on official confirmation. A spokesperson for the Guinness World Records said: 'The record for the Highest combined age, four living siblings, is currently open due to the sad passing of Jack Stepham in 2011. 'We would ask that a record application to be made from a family member or someone on their behalf on the sisters in Harborough so our records team can look into this further.'","Lillian Brown turned 103 on January 23 .

"The FBI on Thursday added a former taxi driver from northern Virginia to its list of most-wanted terrorists, saying he was a recruiter for the al-Shabab terror group in Somalia. An arrest warrant, originally issued in February, was unsealed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Alexandria for Liban Haji Mohamed, 29, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Somalia. He is the older brother of Gulet Mohamed, who for the past four years has been challenging his placement on the government's no-fly list, the attorney representing the younger Mohamed, Gadeir Abbas, told The Associated Press on Thursday. A hearing on Gulet Mohamed's case is scheduled in federal court in Alexandria on Friday. Target: The FBI said on Thursday it added a former Washington, D.C.-area taxi driver, Liban Haji Mohamed, to its list of 'Most Wanted Terrorists' and offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction . Abbas said Liban Mohamed aggressively advocated on his younger brother's behalf when Gulet Mohamed was detained in Kuwait several years ago and barred from returning to the U.S., and that the FBI began to harass him as a result. He said his family suspects he went into hiding to avoid the harassment. 'Al-Shabab has killed Liban's uncle and imprisoned his cousins,' Abbas said. 'His family believes the allegations have no basis in fact.' FBI spokeswoman Lindsay Ram said in an email late Thursday that the FBI had no comment on Abbas' allegations. Liban Mohamed is charged with providing material support to al-Qaida and al-Shabab. Additional court records detailing the charges against him in federal court remained under seal Thursday. He is now one of 31 people on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists. The FBI believes Liban Mohamed left the U.S. in July 2012 for east Africa. He lived in the Alexandria area of Fairfax County prior to that, working as a taxi driver. The FBI says he is a key target because his knowledge of the nation's capital could help al-Shabab plot an attack here. 'It is important for us to locate Mohamed because he has knowledge of the Washington, D.C., area's infrastructure such as shopping areas, Metro, airports, and government buildings,' said Carl Ghattas, special agent in charge of the Counterterrorism Division at the FBI's Washington Field Office. 'This makes him an asset to his terrorist associates who might plot attacks on U.S. soil.' The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Liban Mohamed's arrest and conviction. Travel ban: Gulet Mohamed, (left), leaves the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, with his attorney, Gadeir Abbas, from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, after a hearing challenging his placement on the government's no fly list . Abbas said the timing of the FBI's announcement is an attempt to influence a judge to toss out a lawsuit that Gulet Mohamed filed against the government challenging his placement on the no-fly list. The government is seeking to have the case tossed out, in part because it says it would be forced to divulge state secrets if forced to defend the lawsuit. 'We would question the timing of the FBI's placement of Liban on the most-wanted list on the day before a major hearing on the government's authority to maintain the no-fly list,' Abbas said in a telephone interview. Gulet Mohamed, an Alexandria resident and also naturalized U.S. citizen, was 19 when he was detained by Kuwaiti authorities in 2011. He has said that he was beaten and interrogated at the behest of the U.S. and denied the right to fly home. U.S. authorities allowed Mohamed to fly home after he filed a federal lawsuit, but Mohamed says he remains on the list without justification. Official: This Most Wanted flyer provided by the FBI shows Liban Haji Mohamed. The FBI has added the alleged recruiter for the al-Shabab terror group in Somalia to its list of most-wanted terrorists . Abbas said Liban Mohamed aggressively advocated on his brother's behalf to get him home, and in return the FBI subjected him to harassment. 'He was constantly being approached by people of dubious backgrounds that bore the hallmark of FBI informants,' Abbas said. 'The family believes Liban may have sought to escape that scrutiny.' Abbas said that in 2012, the Mohamed family lost contact with Liban Mohamed and asked the lawyer to see if the FBI knew of his whereabouts. The U.S. has long refused to even confirm whether Gulet Mohamed is on the no-fly list. Gulet Mohamed said he went to Somalia and Yemen briefly in 2009 to stay with family and learn Arabic, and investigators questioned him about his travels. The FBI, in announcing Liban Mohamed's placement on the most-wanted list, described him as a 'close associate' of Zachary Chesser, a northern Virginia man who in 2011 was sentenced to 25 years in prison for trying to join al-Shabab and for making online threats against the creators of the 'South Park' cartoon for an episode perceived as an insult to the prophet Muhammad.","The FBI said on Thursday it added a former Washington, D.C.-area taxi driver, Liban Haji Mohamed, to its list of 'Most Wanted Terrorists'

"Andrew Mitchell is facing financial ruin after losing his legal bid to cut his £3million bill for failed libel action - adding an extra £100,000 to his tab . Disgraced Tory MP Andrew Mitchell is facing financial ruin after losing a legal bid to cut his £3million bill for failed libel action - adding an extra £100,000 to his tab. The former chief whip, 58, was found to have called police officers 'f****** plebs' when they refused to let him cycle through the main Downing Street gate in 2012. He sued The Sun for breaking the 'Plebgate' story, but the MP for Sutton Coldfield was then counter-sued for calling on-duty officer, PC Toby Rowland, a 'serial liar'. Mr Justice Mitting described the MP's behaviour on the night as 'childish' and said his version of events was inconsistent with CCTV footage in a hearing last November. Today the same judge rejected Mitchell's bid to reduce his overall bill after the MP tried to claim that he should only have gone against one legal team, rather than two at London's High Court. The single day's hearing today cost a staggering £70,000 with News Group Newspapers' lawyers billing for £49,917 and PC Rowland's team £20,064. Mitchell has already paid £300,000 in 'interim payments' to The Sun and PC Rowland following the trial. His full bill will be analysed by a specialist costs judge on a date yet to be determined. After losing the libel trial in November, the costs of the entire litigation were unofficially estimated at £3million. The former chief whip was described in court as a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character and claimed that the allegations were a 'web of lies'. He told the judge from the witness box: 'I would never call a policeman a pleb, let alone a f***ing pleb.' It emerged in court that Mitchell had been accused of a pattern of insulting and high-handed behaviour towards officials on at least 16 occasions dating back to 2005. Mr Justice Mitting described the MP's behaviour on the night as 'childish' and said his version of events was inconsistent with CCTV footage (pictured) in a hearing last November . Mr Justice Mitting rejected arguments that Mitchell should only pay for PC Rowland's costs, rather than The Sun's as well. James Price QC, for Mitchell, had argued his client should not pay for lawyers representing The Sun, as this was 'duplication' and 'not proportionate'. He said: 'Did litigating this issue really require two [legal] teams?' 'There should have been only one team - end of story.' Mr Price argued PC Rowland 'had the whip-hand' over The Sun, and could have arranged to argue the case alongside The Sun, rather than separately. Desmond Browne QC, for PC Rowland, said, 'If there is any substance to this point, it should have been raised before the trial.' PC Rowland (left) sued Andrew Mitchell after claiming the former chief whip falsely suggested that he had fabricated his allegations two years ago in a case that has cost at least £3million . Andrew Mitchell, pictured with his wife and daughter, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' after a judge said he did call Downing Street police officers 'f****** plebs' in a hearing last November . Mr Browne said his team had gone to 'scrupulous pains' to avoid duplicating work, but could not have worked as one with The Sun, due to potential conflicts of interest. Nicholas Bacon QC, a specialist costs lawyer representing The Sun, said 'the sensible course' was to have two separate legal teams for PC Rowland and the newspaper. He accused Mr Price of 'a classic application of hindsight' and pointed out Mitchell's legal team had run up more costs than that of either The Sun or PC Rowland. 'It is Mr Mitchell who has not assisted the court here', he said, 'He did not attempt to use the budgeting process to his advantage, so the sympathy which the court has thus far tentatively expressed [for him] does need to be looked at in the light of our submissions'. CCTV footage shows the former chief whip approaching the  main Downing Street gate on his bike in 2012 . Referring to an offer to settle with The Sun in September last year, Mr Justice Mitting said, 'If Mr Mitchell had accepted that offer, then he would have got what he now in fact seeks. 'There would have been a trial of the preliminary issue between him and PC Rowland only. Only one set of costs would have been incurred and would have been paid by him, if - as was the case - he lost.' He said lawyers for The Sun 'were entitled to protect their interests in any reasonable manner which they saw fit. They made an offer which would have eliminated all risks of adverse costs findings, both for themselves and Mr Mitchell, at the trial of the preliminary issue.' Mr Justice Mitting refused to direct that Mitchell should only pay one of his opponent's costs, saying, 'Accordingly, I decline to make the expression or view I otherwise would.' After deciding Mitchell had 'lost' the hearing, he ordered another interim payment of £25,000, to be split between The Sun and PC Rowland's legal teams. Negotiations regarding damages due to PC Rowland continue, and a trial will be held if the matter cannot be agreed out of court. Andrew Mitchell has been accused of high-handed behaviour at least 16 times dating back to 2005. Those outlined to the High Court included: . NOVEMBER 2005:Mr Mitchell tried to cycle through a heavy gate into Black Rod's garden as it was being closed by a security guard. Lee Bryer shouted 'stop' several times but the MP ignored his requests and cycled through. Mr Bryer caught up with Mr Mitchell and asked him why he did not stop. Mr Mitchell allegedly said: I'm an MP and I'm too important to stop for you. Stop being so aggressive, you little s***.' MAY 2011: The MP arrived at the main gate of Downing Street on his bicycle and told officers: 'Let me in. I'm a Cabinet MP and I'm late for a meeting.' PC Bruce Smart had no idea who he was so phoned the control room at No 10. He said: 'The custodian told me that although allowing him access this way was against security policy, denying him entry would be more trouble than it was worth, and so I should just let him in.' JUNE 2011: For a second time Mr Mitchell had a confrontation with PC Smart at the Downing Street gates – but this time the officer refused to let him through due to 'security reasons'. When Iain Duncan Smith arrived by car the officers had to open the main gate. They finally allowed Mr Mitchell through after a polite request from Mr Duncan Smith. As Mr Mitchell cycled through, he allegedly said: 'Bruce Smart, is it? You shall be hearing about this. Don't think you've heard the last of this – I'm going to make a complaint to the Commissioner.' The MP demanded full disciplinary proceedings be brought against PC Smart. The officer said: 'During both my encounters with Mr Mitchell his behaviour was arrogant and rude.' JUNE 2011: PC Joseph Withington was on duty at Downing Street when Mr Mitchell allegedly shouted 'chop, chop' as officers opened the main gate for him. The MP is then alleged to have said: 'Always helps if you do this as rapidly as possible – we're all in a hurry.' PC Withington told the court Mr Mitchell used a 'condescendingly rude tone', adding: 'It's completely unnecessary, patronising and sarcastic to be spoken to like that.' AUGUST 3, 2011: When Mr Mitchell arrived in Djerba, an island off the coast of Tunisia, during his stint as International Development Secretary, he told his protection team he wanted to travel to Libya. Inspector Duncan Johnston, who ran the team, told him such a trip was not possible as it would breach international law. Mr Mitchell allegedly replied: 'That's a bit above your pay grade, Mr Plod.' Inspector Johnston said he found this 'rather insulting, discourteous and demeaning'. AUGUST 17, 2011: Two weeks later Mr Mitchell 'launched into a foul-mouthed tirade' at members of his protection team when a trip from Kenya to Somalia was changed for security reasons. Inspector Johnston said: 'He used a tirade of language that … was just swearing for the sake of swearing.' Mr Mitchell demanded to know how many officers had been sent to Kenya in advance of him and allegedly accused them of treating it as a holiday. He allegedly said: 'British taxpayers are funding this for police officers to sit by the pool.' EARLY SEPTEMBER, 2012: On one visit to Downing Street Mr Mitchell had to cycle through the pedestrian gate, rather than the main gate. He shouted to officers: 'I'm coming through that gate next time.' PC Michael Penton said: 'I found Mr Mitchell's behaviour to be rude and condescending.' SEPTEMBER 18, 2012: On the night before 'Plebgate', Mr Mitchell allegedly shouted: 'I'm the Government Chief Whip. I want to leave through these gates.' PC Gareth Bonds said: 'During this exchange I stood and watched in disbelief at how childish a grown man in his position was being and found it embarrassing. 'I therefore spoke to my colleagues and told them to just open the gates as it was ridiculous to argue over a gate. I found Mr Mitchell's tone overbearing.'","Disgraced Tory MP Andrew Mitchell lost battle to cut £3m bill for failed libel .

"This is the view across the Pennines to be savoured should you be lucky enough to scale the heights of the tallest free-standing structure in the United Kingdom, the Emley Moor Transmitting Station, near Kirklees in West Yorkshire. The 1,084ft tower is the fourth tallest tower in the European Union and world's 23rd tallest tower at 70ft taller than London's 1,014ft Shard skyscraper. At 493ft taller than the capital's 591ft Gherkin, 21ft higher than the Eiffel Tower and more than six times taller than Trafalgar Square's Nelson's Column, the concrete structure hides in plain sight as one of Britain's best kept secrets, believes site manager Paul French.

'It's probably one of the best kept secrets around,' says French, 54. 'Most people I tell seem to think that the Shard in London is the tallest (in Britain), but I'm sure a lot of people definitely don't know that it is in fact Emley Moor.' It takes a full eight minutes to take the elevator from the bottom to the top in a journey not for those squeamish about heights and on a clear day it is said you can see for 40 miles. Far from a mere view point, more than 1.5million people rely on the mast at its top to beam hundreds of channels of digital television to them from Greater Manchester 40 miles away to Scarborough on the east coast. The TV mast, known officially as The Arqiva Tower, can be seen for miles and features a control room at 892 feet with a stunning view across the Pennines. 'I'm not scared of heights but there is a trap door at the top that has just fresh air underneath so that is a cause for concern,' says French, who has worked at Emley Moor for 32 years.

The original 450ft tower was erected in 1956 and entered service for ITV on November 3 that year, before it was replaced by a 1,265ft version in 1964. But on March 19, 1969, the building spectacularly collapsed under the weight of ice and high winds, leaving debris strewn across fields and knocking out TV service for millions of viewers. After years of temporary masts, work on the new tower that now stands, began later that year and was completed in 1970. Paul said: 'We didn't have a colour television at the time but I remember we lost ITV for four days.

"A leaked design for a case has revealed more details of Apple's much rumoured iPad Pro tablet. The giant tablet is expected to have a large screen over over 12 inches. It could go on sale within months, and help reinvigorate iPad sales. Scroll down for video . The tablet is also expected to have four speakers, and could even featur two charging ports allowing it to remain plugged in when in either portrait of landscape mode. According to French blog nowhereelse.fr, the case is from a 'reliable source' which has previously given them advance details of Apple's product, which the firm is notoriously secretive about. 'The iPad or iPad Air Plus Pro should be unveiled sometime between the months of March and April,' the site claims, and 'would be equipped with a screen measuring from 12.2 to 12.9 inches diagonally,' it says. The tablet is also expected to have four speakers, and could even featur two charging ports allowing it to remain plugged in when in either portrait of landscape mode. It comes weeks after an image was leaked that appeared to be a mould for the device. The photo was reportedly taken at Apple manufacturer Foxconn's factory in China and is said to measure approximately 12 inches high by 8.7 inches wide. It follows a leaked sketch from last week that claimed to show one corner of the so-called megapad, iPad Pro or iPad Air Plus. The photo of the mould (pictured) was reportedly taken at Apple manufacturer Foxconn's factory in China. Experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height, 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep (305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm). The latest image was posted on Chinese social network Weibo. If the rumours are true, the iPad Pro would be significantly larger than the current iPad Air 2. Experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height, 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep (305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm). By comparison, the iPad Air 2 is 9.4 inches by 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches (240mm x 169.5mm x 6.1mm). Name: Popular suggestions for the name of the supersized tablet include the iPad Air Plus - taking its lead from Apple's iPhone 6 Plus smartphone, and the iPad Pro. Size: The tablet is rumoured to have a 12.2 inch screen, although other dimensions have also been suggested. Rumours suggest it will be just 7mm thick. Design: The leaked 'sketch' suggests that the iPad Air Plus will be similar in design to the iPad Air 2, with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges. USP: The image differs from the smaller tablet however, because of grilles on the top of the shell, which suggest the device will include stereo speakers, as rumoured. Launch: Sources have suggested different launch times, but there is some consensus that the tablet may make its debut before the summer. The iPad Air 2 has a 9.7-inch display, while the iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 12.2-inch screen. This would put the Pro on par with Samsung's 12.2-inch Galaxy Note Pro, which launched in February. Last week's leaked sketch, also reportedly taken by an employee who works at Foxconn seemed to show a grille that will also boast four speakers for stereo sound. The image was released by French website Nowhere Else, which has previously leaked details  from unannounced smartphones and Apple gadgets which proved to be true, citing a Foxconn source. The source said that initial testing for the iPad Air Plus was stopped in the summer and Apple’s suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet. The sketch suggests that the tablet will look similar to the iPad Air 2 in design, with rounded corners and the same standby button, rear camera, microphone and volume buttons placement. However, seemingly confirming rumours that the larger tablet will offer stereo sound, there appears to be a speaker grill on the top of the shell. Japanese magazine Mac Fan claimed in December that the iPad Air Plus will also feature a much faster A9 processor and is set to launch between April and June. By comparison, the iPad Air 2 (pictured) is 9.4 inches x 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches (240 mm x 169.5 mm x 6.1 mm). Sources have suggested different launch times for the iPad Air Plus, but the general consensus is that the supersized tablet may make its debut before the summer . A leaked photo of a sketch (pictured) reportedly taken by an employee who works in a Foxconn factory, where iPads are made, also suggests that the rumours of an ‘iPad Air Plus’ with a 12.2 inch screen, are true . Bloomberg and other publications reported that Apple was planning on releasing the device sometime in early 2015, while a recent report from The Wall Street Journal said the Californian firm had postponed mass production of the larger iPad from December 2014 into next year as suppliers struggled to meet demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch. These designs showed the gadget as just 7mm thick, but the size of the screen is uncertain, with rumours suggesting measurements between 12 inches and 12.9 inches. The first suggestion of a supersized tablet came just weeks after claims that the large screen size of the iPhone 6 Plus was impacting on iPad usage. The release of Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus means there is now only a 2.4-inch difference between the size of the phablet’s screen, and the display on its iPad mini. Analysis has revealed that as phones become larger, more people are using them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant. The iPad Air 2 has a 9.7-inch display, while the iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 12.2-inch screen.This would put the Pro on par with Samsung's Galaxy Note Pro, which launched last February (pictured) The iPad Air Plus is expected to have a 12.2inch screen or even larger, dwarfing the iPad Mini with its 7.9inch screen (left) and iPad Air (right) with a 9.7 inch screen . A study by Pocket - an app that lets users save webpages, videos and other content for reading - recently found that people who upgraded to an iPhone 6 Plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before. It analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app, and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an iPhone 5, 5C and 5S and those who now own an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also looked at the use of tablets by the same people. A survey comparing the  before-and-after behaviour of iPhone and iPad users revealed that people with an iPhone 5S use their phone 55% of the time, but this increases to 72% for the iPhone 6 and 80% for the iPhone 6 Plus - both at the detriment of the iPad, perhaps explaining why Aple is planning a larger one . Pocket also saw users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Those with the iPhone 6 (centre) opened 33% more articles and videos inside Pocket than they did with a 5S (left), and those with a 6 Plus (right) opened 65% more items than before . The iPhone 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through September and into early October, while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent. Apple's cheaper iPhone 5S and 5C handsets made up the rest of the sales. Following last year's launch, the 5S and 5C accounted for 84 per cent of total iPhone sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular. The skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the iPhone 6 Plus are lower because Apple is struggling to complete orders. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. ‘The bigger your phone’s screen, the more time you’ll spend reading and watching on it,’ explained the researchers in a blog post. ‘In fact, the bigger your phone’s screen, the more you’ll read and watch as a whole.’ It discovered that users who upgraded to an iPhone 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time, up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen. Pocket also saw that users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. But, a larger screen does make the smartphone less portable and Pocket noticed that people with an iPhone 6 Plus read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. ‘This tells us that, at least for now, convenience and portability trump a better, and bigger, entertainment and reading experience.’","claims case is first to be designed for Apple's new tablet .

"Shrouded in anonymity, the questions people ask on the internet can provide a candid snapshot of their concerns. Now, based on queries made on Yahoo! Answers over seven years, a new study has uncovered the drug-related problems on the minds of six different nations. The revealing survey found that marijuana is by far the most talked about drug beating cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine, in every country but the UK. Scroll down for video . Marijuana is by far the most talked about drug  beating substances such as cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine in most countries. In the UK, cocaine is the most popular drug with around 32 per cent of all search queries relating to the substance . But it's not the effects that people are concerned with the most. A closer look at the data suggests that almost every nation wants to find out how to dodge a drugs test. The survey was conducted by drug-related website Detox.net, who focused on six countries; the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Spain, Australia, and Italy. As well as the number of queries, the group looked at the first two words most commonly associated with questions about the drugs analysed. Overall, marijuana was the drug most people had on their minds, followed by cocaine, Xanaz, heroin, MDMA and opiates . In the US and Australia, marijuana appears to be the most popular drug, with the most common search terms being, 'how long do the effects last?' The most common questions for heroin is 'what is it?' follow by 'how long do the effects last?' and 'why do heroine?'. More people are concerned about how long the effects of marijuana last, than its health impacts . When it came to MDMA, 'Is it' were the two most commonly used first words when posing questions. In many cases, these words were related to the safety of using the drug, like: 'Is it safe to take MDMA while on antibiotics?' The most common question about bath salts, was where they could be purchased . When it came to Xanax, 'Is it' was the most popular pair of words leading off people's questions. Many of those questions were in regards to the safety of mixing the drug with other substances . Tweets often reveal growing trends among young people - and now scientists have revealed cannabis has become a popular topic. During a single month, researchers identified more than seven million tweets referring to marijuana, with 'pro-pot' messages outnumbering those opposed to the drug by 15 to one. Most of those sending and receiving 'pot tweets' were under the age of 25, and many in their teens, said the team. US psychiatrist and lead author Dr Patricia Cavazos-Rehg, from the Washington University Institute for Public Health, said: 'It's a concern because frequent marijuana use can affect brain structures and interfere with cognitive function, emotional development and academic performance. 'The younger people are when they begin using marijuana, the more likely they are to become dependent.' 'A lot of young people will phase out of marijuana use as they get older, but unfortunately, we're not good at predicting who those individuals are.' In the UK, cocaine is the most popular drug with around 34 per cent of all search queries relating to the substance. It is thought one in 20 British teenagers between 15 and 16 have tried cocaine. In May, tests revealed that cocaine use is so widespread that experts were able to locate traces of the drug in Britain's drinking water. Marijuana follows in second at 29 per cent and heroin in third, with 15 per cent of questions relating to the drug. The most common questions for heroin include 'what is it?' followed by 'how long do the effects last?' 'In this digital age, it's not surprising that people are seeking advice online,' Detox.net writes. 'However, what is startling is the extent to which people of all ages may forego real medical opinions on important health topics and, instead, settle for the virtual wisdom offered by faceless strangers.' To get a picture of what advice people were receiving, the group researched some of the answers to these questions. When people asked how long marijuana stays in their system, the most popular answer was that marijuana attaches itself to fat or is fat soluble, so typically it can stay in your system for seven days. Overall, marijuana was the most the drug most people had on their minds, followed by cocaine, Xanaz, heroin, MDMA and opiates . The survey used queries made on Yahoo! Answers over seven year. This graph shows how query numbers changed from 2007-2014, with marijuana searches spiking in 2011 . 'Since you only took one hit, the levels may not be high enough to detect in a UA [urinalysis],' the advice continued. 'Drink lots of water and exercise. You need to sweat a ton and burn some fat.' This, however, is only half-true, according to Detox.net. Marijuana takes longer than any other common drug to be cleared from your system because THC is stored in your fat cells. The rest, the site says, depends entirely on habits. The survey found that the most common question for bath salts was: 'Where can I get the bath salts that get you high?' Here, Yahoo Answers advised the anonymous to smoke weed instead. Detox.net said: While we don't endorse the illicit use of marijuana, it is without a doubt less harmful than substances like mephedrone, which is commonly present in cocktails labeled as 'bath salts'. The most common words to asked questions about marijuana included smoking, medical, high and help. The dangers of marijuana include inhibited brain development in teenagers and young adult, the website said . The most common words to asked questions about cocaine included smoking, help, test and songs. Overall cocaine was the second most popular drugs, with 15 per cent of search terms relating to the substance . 'The dangers of marijuana include inhibited brain development in teenagers and young adults, as well as respiratory problems from long-term use. 'Contrast those concerns with the immediate side effects of paranoia, agitation, hallucinations, psychotic behaviour, and violent behaviour that you get with bath salts.' The website says that though Yahoo! Answers might seem, at first glance, like a playground for pranksters looking to share awful advice with potential drug users, the best answers tended to be legitimately helpful. They often encourage drug users to seek help with their addictions or encouraging people to stay away from potentially harmful substances. 'However, if you or a loved one are seeking answers for drug-related questions or need help with treating an addiction, we would strongly advise turning to a professional for help before seeking help from an Internet community,' it added. Common words used to search for MDMA included ecstasy, pills, effects, cocaine, weed, bad, and Molly .","This is based on questions asked on Yahoo! Answers over seven years .

"A mother is furious after her 15-year-old daughter came home from school crying with a chopped off ponytail of her once waist-length hair in her hands.

Carla Fontes, 15, hadn't cut her hair since intermediate school, but her coach at Waiakea High School, Stan Haraguchi, thought the locks flowing below her waist were interfering with the sport.

'Coach thinks it was hard for me to wrestle with my hair long,' Fontes said in an interview on Wednesday. 'When we wrestle in a match, we wear hair nets.' She allowed the coach to cut her hair at a team meeting Monday, even though Fontes' mother had expressly forbidden it. Fontes said she didn't relay that information to Haraguchi. The coach has been suspended, said Donalyn Dela Cruz, spokeswoman for the state Department of Education. Arlette Fontes was furious when her 15-year-old daughter came home with shoulder-length hair. 'I'm shaking,' the mother told Hawaii Tribune-Herald . 'My daughter's hair went all the way down her butt before. Now it looks like a rat has been nibbling on it. That's a piece of her, gone. A piece of her body.' Carla Fontes said she loves wrestling and wants the sport to lead to a college scholarship. 'It lets me take some of my anger out,' she said of wrestling. She said she wishes that her hair wasn't cut, 'but it is what it is.' Haraguchi declined to comment. Suspended: Stan Haraguchi is suspended from his coaching job at Waikea High School because he cut his student's hair in a bet without her mother's permission . 'In any educational situation, it is always best practice to receive parent consent before making any decision that directly affects a student, especially in a situation like this,' Principal Kelcy Koga said in an email. Arlette Fontes said she will pursue charges against Haraguchi. Hawaii County police said the department started an investigation Tuesday. 'I told her no, I’m your parent, I didn’t give him the parental right to do that,' Arlette Fontes said. 'No one’s going to cut my baby’s hair.' Carla Fontes admitted she didn’t tell her coach that her mother wouldn't allow her to get her hair chopped off. 'I told him it was OK, as long as it was not too short,' Carla Fontes said. According to Carla Fontes' aunt Roberta, Carla was crying when she got home from school. 'I asked her, ""What happened?"" and she said, ""Coach cut my hair,""' Roberta Fontes said. 'I couldn’t believe it.' Roberta then called her sister who was furious to hear that her daughter’s hair had been cut by the coach. 'I was still working. My sister called me frantic. She said, ""Arlette, you don’t know what he did!"" I said ""What, sis?"" She said, ""He cut off all her hair!"" I said, ""What?!"" I kind of had an indication from the weekend, but I didn’t think he would follow through on Monday,' the girl’s mother Arlette Fontes said. Carla Fontes may have been a little upset that her long dark hair now only reaches her shoulders but she thinks the whole thing has been blown out of proportion. 'Our team really pushed a lot,' she said, adding that she thinks Haraguchi is a good coach. Horrified: Arlette Fontes said she will pursue charges against coach Stan Haraguchi who cut off her daughter's waist length hair as part of a bet over losing a match .","Carla Fontes' coach at Waiakea High School, Stan Haraguchi, cut her hair as part of a bet last week and now he's been suspended from his job .

"A fishing village's park known as 'Hitlers Walk' since the 1930s is to have its name reinstated after it was removed a decade ago. The old signs in Mevagissey, Cornwall were taken down in 2005 following a small number of complaints that the name was offensive. The decision by the then Restormel Borough Council to remove the signs was branded 'political correctness gone mad'. Decision reversed: A park in Mevagissey, Cornwall, known as 'Hitlers Walk' since the 1930s is to have its name reinstated after being removed a decade ago following complaints it was offensive . And villagers insisted the moniker did not honour the Nazi leader but was adopted in the 1930s in reference to an overly-officious local councillor. The man was said to have a habit of walking up and down checking on the boats moored in the harbour. In 2005, then parish clerk John Olford said the decision to remove the two signs was 'ludicrous'. This week he said he was 'delighted' that the decision was being reversed. 'It's about time,' Mr Olford added. Controversial: The old signs in Mevagissey, Cornwall were taken down in 2005 following a small number of complaints. Many branded the decision 'political correctness gone mad' 'It has been called Hitlers Walk since the 1930s, then some idiot who was an incomer said ""oh, you can't call it Hitlers Walk"". I'm delighted it's being put back up.' The parish council voted to restore it, saying the park - once called Cliff Park - had been called Hitlers Walk for more than 60 years and was known by villagers as such. Councillors heard that a quote had been obtained to replace the sign at a cost of £147. Coun John Daniel, one of those who has been calling for the sign to be replaced, said: 'This is not just for me, it is for all the parish.' Historic: Mevagissey is a village, fishing port and civil parish in Cornwall that dates as far back as 1313 . Innocent reference: Villagers in Mevagissey insisted the moniker did not honour the Nazi leader but was adopted in the 1930s in reference to an overly-officious park-keeper . Fittingly, news of the council's reversed decision comes on the day the nation marked the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill's state funeral. The boat that carried the coffin of the wartime leader down the Thames on this day in 1965 traced the same route to the Palace of Westminster, where a wreath was laid in tribute. Tower Bridge was raised as members of Churchill's family, on board the merchant vessel Havengore, sailed past crowds of well-wishers who had gathered to commemorate the revered former Prime Minister.

"A Kansas man who left his 10-month-old foster daughter to die in a hot car while he and his partner smoked weed and watched 'Game of Thrones,' has been sentenced to 32 months in prison . 'I'm not a monster,' said Seth Jackson, 29, in court on Friday as he begged the judge not to give him jail time for the death of kadillak Poe-Jones. 'Your honor, I'm a broken man, pleading here for my life,' Jackson told the judge on Friday. Jackson wiped away his tears as he was sentenced. His lawyers have 14 days to appeal the sentencing. On a sweltering 90-degree day in July Seth Jackson and his partner Payton Schroeder watched over two hours of Game of Thrones as their five other children played inside. Scroll down for video . Sentencing: Seth Jackson, 29,  pictured in court today, begged for a judge not to put him behind bars  and told the judge he was 'not a monster' Dead: Kadillak Poe Jones was left in a hot car for over two hours and left to die as her foster parents got high and watched Game of Thrones . Tortured: Seth Jackson's mother says her son 'wants to die' and that he dedicated his entire life to children . Jackson's mother also spoke up for her son telling NBC reporters, 'he is devastated. He wants to die.' She said her son lived for his children and for the high school students he taught. She said he never would have wanted any child to feel harm and that he wishes it were him inside of the car instead of the young girl. It wasn't until Jackson heard a baby's cries on television that he remembered Poe-Jones was still sitting inside the hot car with the windows rolled up. The judge said that while Jackson did not mean to leave his foster daughter in a car, it was not an accident. Heartbroken: Seth Jackson, who has five other children with his partner, says he no longer has anything to live for and wishes it were he who died inside of the hot car instead of his foster daughter . Police say the girl was inside the car with the windows up for more than two hours. It was around 90 degrees outside. An autopsy showed she died of hyperthermia due to heat exposure. The affidavit says Schroeder told police that Jackson called that day to let him know he would be picking Kadillak up from the baby sitter after taking their 5-year-old adopted child to a doctor's appointment. Jackson told police that when he arrived home, he locked the car and went inside with his 5-year-old and pizza he had picked up. Schroeder revealed to investigators that he and Jackson smoked marijuana that Jackson had earlier picked up that day, according to the affidavit. Both men said they ran to the car to retrieve Kadillak and call authorities. Schroeder told investigators Kadillak was hot and stiff when she was taken from the car and carried into the house. As he called 911, Jackson attempted CPR but could not get the child's mouth open, according to the affidavit filed by Wichita police detective Ryan Schomaker. Tragic: Seth Jackson (right) and Payton Schroeder (left) had hoped to adopt 10-month-old Kadillak Poe-Jones but sadly their lack of attention lead to her death . Family: In addition to Kadillak, whom they were trying to adopt, Jackson and his partner had five other children in their care. They had three other foster children ages 3, 5 and 18, and two adopted children ages 5 and 7 . Couple: Jackson, left, is seen with partner Payton Schroeder with whom he was watching game of Thrones when his foster daughter died . Officers who responded found Jackson still on the phone when they arrived, making calls and repeatedly stating, 'I left her in the car, she's dead, she's dead,' according to the affidavit. Meanwhile, Kadillak was unresponsive and lying on her back on the couch. Firefighters moved her from the couch to the floor once they arrived and attempted to revive her. Later in an interview at police headquarters, Schroeder told detectives he and Jackson had been foster parents to Kadillak since she was 2 weeks old. Although the girl died of hyperthermia, Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said the first-degree murder charge was warranted because the child died during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony, aggravated endangering of a child. The case is not charged as intentional murder. In addition to Kadillak, whom they were trying to adopt, Jackson and Schroeder had five other children in their care. They had three other foster children ages 3, 5 and 18, and two adopted children ages 5 and 7. The two younger foster children were visiting other relatives at the time the 10-month-old died. The Kansas Department of Children and Families (DCF) said in a July 30 statement 'We remain deeply saddened that this child suffered such a horrific death. We support the charges filed in this case, and we will aid in any way possible the prosecution of the defendant.' The children were taken by the state.","'I'm not a monster,' said Seth Jackson, 29, in court on Friday as he begged the judge not to give him jail time for the death of kadillak Poe-Jones .

"From lovely lace at Chanel to dripping diamonds at Schiaparelli, the Paris haute couture shows are the stuff of fashion dreams. The garments, some of which require 300 hours of work, are crafted with the red carpet in mind and are so bespoke that they don't even come with a price tag because if you're lucky enough to snap one up, budget is of no relevance. The SS15 haute couture catwalks served up the boldest and most forward-thinking designs the city has seen in a good few years; haute is all about making a statement after all (even if no one buys the clothes). FEMAIL rounds up the most glamorous moments the week had to offer. FEMAIL rounds up the most lavish moments of Paris haute couture week, starting with Chanel's runway, which was transformed into a paper jungle and watched by the likes of Kris Jenner and Anna Wintour . It makes sense to start with Chanel, which has become one of the most talked-about, anticipated and well-attended shows in haute couture history. Watched from the front row by Kris Jenner, Anna Wintour and Kristin Stewart, Karl Lagerfeld sent his models - including Kendall Jenner - down the beautifully ornate runway in tulle, thousand-colour boucle and crystal flower embellished everything. Clearly a key theme in the paper jungle show, flowers featured prominently and hair maestro Sam McKnight's hair decorations, which hung from each girl's low plait, trended on social media. Karl Lagerfeld - the King of couture - unveiled crop tops and lavish skirts embellished with thousands of ornate floral sequins and tulle, as modelled by his new muse, Kendall Jenner, right . Giving the Chanel showspace a run for its money was Dior's haute couture show, which was held across two levels. Adding to the drama, the upper deck was supported by white scaffolding so that the clatter of the models' shoes added to the general ambiance of the show. There were printed catsuits, ballerina dresses and plenty of sequins, as well as knitted minidresses,  crop tops and stripes in abundance. Perhaps the most talked-about item on the catwalk was the latex legging boots in bold, primary colours and ankle boots with Perspex heels. Over at Zuhair Murad was a whole different story. The Beirut-based Lebanese fashion designer, who is loved by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Jennifer Lopez, sent models down the runway in beautifully embellished floral tulle gowns. The ethereal gowns, which were decorated with blush pink rosebuds and smatterings of sparkle, will no doubt be gracing the Oscar red carpet next year. The ornate gowns were sometimes slashed from the chest to the naval, but the long sleeves and floor-length hemlines kept a certain conservatism about them.

Zuhair Murad, a Beirut-based Lebanese fashion designer, who is loved by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Jennifer Lopez, sent models down the runway in beautifully embellished floral tulle gowns . The Ralph & Russo runway was a similar story. Watched from the front row by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and her husband, the designers aimed to capture the Goddess of Spring with a majestic collection that they say symbolised nature’s regenerative powers. For SS15, the Ralph & Russo muse is an 'exultant deity, whose gifts lend themselves to delight', they say. Acclaimed for its excellence in craftsmanship, the maison de couture aims to inspire with eye-catching embellishment, such as petal appliqué and pearl embroidery; the devil really is in the detail. The colour palette - crisp and most sophisticated - was full of pomegranate pinks, soft mints and cornflower blues. The collection, above all, aims to flatter the female form thanks to sheaths of organza, which promise to hug the figure in all the right places. The show saw the models metamorphose into fairies and nymphs, gracefully collecting blossoms in their structured collars or scattering buds into the folds of their gowns - and Mrs Fernandez-Versini seemed most impressed. The designers at Ralph & Russo were inspired by the 'goddess of spring' with detail such as blue and white petal appliqué and pearl embroidery sewn to Fifties-style dresses and flirty tulle-lined strapless dresses . A model wears the bridal gown closing the Ralph & Russo show in dramatic fashion . Lindsey Wixson walked the Jean Paul Gaultier runway show in a dungaree style gown teamed with some interesting headgear . Jean Paul Gaultier's show opened with the silhouette of a bride in a cloud of dry ice to the beats of Billy Idol's White Wedding. Each model that followed rocked a look as flamboyant as the one before it from a red snakeskin blinged up trench-dress to a modern take on Madonna’s famous conical bra. Lindsey Wixson walked the runway show in a dungaree style gown teamed with a beekeeper-esque hat and Naomi Campbell drew loud cheers as she closed the show looking as youthful as she did when she stepped out for the designer twenty years ago. Valentino, a label coveted by the A-list, served up romantic skirts, dresses and coats printed with poetic embellishment. The brand's creative directors, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli, were inspired by 'love in its purest form' and SS15 was a story of billowing velvet dresses and hand-embroidered sheepskin coats. The duo's main source of inspiration came from the work of Marc Chagall, the Russian-French artist who travelled between St Petersburg and Paris before World War One. The SS15 pieces took cue from Chagall’s romantic and modernist interpretation of different cultures. There was plenty of white tulle hand-painted in grey and embroidered with pearls and delicate flowers. One dress, which was splashed with the moon and smatterings of stars, took a staggering 3,000 hours to embroider on hand painted linen.
