"U.S. Vice President Joe Biden asked Ecuador ""to please reject"" the request for asylum from self-avowed National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, according to Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa. Snowden wasn't in Ecuador on Saturday, but if he does arrive there, the country will make a decision based on sovereignty, taking into account U.S. input, Correa said in his weekly broadcast on state TV. Ben Rhodes, deputy director of the U.S. National Security Council, confirmed that Biden spoke with Correa about Snowden and the bilateral relationship, but Rhodes declined to provide details. In a telephone conversation with Biden on Friday, Correa told him ""what was the Ecuadorian position"" and that Ecuador ""can't even proceed with the request because Mr. Snowden is not in Ecuadorian territory."" Europe furious, 'shocked' by report of U.S. spying . Correa said Ecuador would be cautious about processing any asylum request from Snowden. ""We have to act very carefully but with courage, without contradicting our principles but with a lot of care, responsibility and respect of course towards the U.S. but also respect for the truth,"" Correa said. The president said that he doesn't want ""to harm his country"" but is ""not going to give up on the principles and the sovereignty"" of Ecuador. ""We need to be very realistic. We use the U.S. currency. We are extremely vulnerable. We shouldn't make any false assumptions,"" Correa said. Snowden, 29, faces espionage charges in the United States for allegedly leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs. Correa said that the first ones to be consulted ""would be the U.S. as we did in the Assange case with England."" He was referring to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who's been residing in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for almost a year. Obama: Pay no attention to that man we can't capture . Ecuador granted asylum last year to Assange so he could avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is sought for questioning in two alleged sex crimes that he denies. Assange fears ultimately being transferred to the United States, he said. Earlier this month on CNN's AC360, Assange spoke from the embassy and urged Snowden to go to Latin America because it has ""a long tradition of asylum."" Correa said neither he nor officials in Quito authorized travel documents that diplomats in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London issued to Snowden. The document ""was issued without our knowledge,"" and he blamed the consul in London, Correa said. ""They think I'm such an idiot that I ordered our consul in London to issue a document so an American citizen can leave China and travel to Russia. This consul will face the necessary sanctions,"" Correa said. Biden made his phone call the day after Correa and other top Ecuadorian officials said they wouldn't bow to U.S. pressure about Snowden. Ecuador is turning down trade benefits given by the United States as part of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, Ecuadorian officials said. Father proposes deal for Snowden's voluntary return . On Thursday, Correa gave a fiery speech. ""In the face of threats, insolence and arrogance of certain U.S. sectors, which have pressured to remove the preferential tariffs because of the Snowden case, Ecuador tells the world we unilaterally and irrevocably renounce the preferential tariffs,"" Correa said. ""It is outrageous to try to delegitimize a state for receiving a petition of asylum."" The South American country is now in the international spotlight as a global manhunt continues for Snowden, a fugitive who has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs. Snowden worked as a security guard at the U.S. National Security Agency, then in a computer security job with the CIA, and then as an NSA analyst with government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii.","Ecuadorian consul in London will face sanctions for giving travel papers to Snowden .

"Four years ago, the discovery of 11 decomposed bodies inside an East Cleveland home seemed like the kind of devastating, once-in-generations event that would spur change for the better. Then, this spring, came the shocking allegations of three women who told police they'd been held captive for years, sometimes raped and beaten, by a man named Ariel Castro, in a house just a few miles away. Lightning had struck twice. But, surely, it couldn't happen again. Yet it did. Last weekend, authorities found the bodies of three women, wrapped in plastic in a style reminiscent of the victims of serial killer Anthony Sowell, the man sentenced to death in the 2009 case. It does raise questions: What's up with Cleveland? Why so many high-profile crimes in such a short span? Why such violence against the metro area's women? Cleveland neighborhood struggles with horrors . It's the kind of question academics could spend an entire career researching and still not reach a satisfying answer. After all, the murder rate in Cleveland's metropolitan area isn't out of line with that of other Rust Belt communities. And while more rapes are reported per capita than in many other cities, the director of a Cleveland rape center says there's nothing particularly unusual about sexual violence there, compared with other cities. Cleveland's police department declined a CNN request to talk about the recent crimes. But to those who study the city, some patterns do emerge: crushing poverty, dehumanizing unemployment and thousands of tumbledown vacant homes -- ideal places to rape and kill in the shadows. ""I hate to say this, but in a sense, to a large degree, we have an underclass in the city of Cleveland of those that truly are disconnected from the social fabric, from the mainstream economy and society,"" said Ronnie Dunn, an urban studies professor at Cleveland State University. ""They're left without anything to grasp onto."" Cleveland and poverty are no strangers. Once a hub of the nation's industrial might -- shipping out seemingly endless streams of iron, steel, machinery and automobiles from its perch on Lake Erie  -- the city that once housed nearly a million people now has barely a third of that population. In East Cleveland, where authorities found the three bodies over the weekend, more than half of families with children under the age of 5 live in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The median household income is half that of the nation as a whole.  And East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton says 2,500 vacant and abandoned homes crowd his city's three square miles. Across Cuyahoga County, home to the entire Cleveland metro area, about 76,000 residences are vacant, according to Census figures. It's a perfect environment for crime and social indifference to thrive, said Dunn. But that doesn't explain what makes Cleveland different -- plenty of cities across the nation suffer from urban rot. Maybe it's a history of extreme racial disparity in Cuyahoga County's justice system, crime author James Renner says. He says such disparities drive a wedge between police and residents of impoverished areas, making them reluctant to go to authorities to report crime for fear they might be hassled by police themselves. That, he says, allowed criminals time and space to do their work and ""created the perfect killing fields for these men."" Sowell, for instance, killed for at least two years before he was caught. Castro snatched the first of his victims a decade before he was finally arrested. And authorities have not said how long they believe East Cleveland's Michael Madison, charged in the three most recent deaths, may have been killing. The bodies of his victims were badly decomposed, authorities said this week. One of them was found in an abandoned house. Again, similar things could be said of many big cities, where pockets of social rot provide an ideal habitat for criminals to set up shop. ""Violence knows no boundaries,"" Norton, the East Cleveland mayor, told CNN's Martin Savidge. ""Violence occurs in California. It occurs in Iowa. It occurs in Texas. It occurs in Ohio."" Indeed, Cleveland's raw violent crime statistics aren't particularly out of line with those of other big Rust Belt cities. The city had 84 murders in 2012 and a violent crime rate of 1,386 for every 100,000 residents, according to Bureau of Justice Statistics figures. That's lower than Baltimore's crime rate and a pale shadow of Detroit's, where 386 people were murdered in 2012 amid a crime rate one and a half times higher than Cleveland's. But the city's rape statistics do seem to paint a somewhat different picture. In 2012, police took reports on 92 rapes for every 100,000 residents -- more than double the rate in Baltimore or Detroit. Only a few cities had a higher rate of reported rapes. That might suggest a particular problem with sexual violence against women in the Cleveland area, Dunn said. ""There are some things in the culture in this area where it appears that the lives of women in particular have been devalued,"" he said. He said some men seem emasculated by their economic plight, and violence sometimes results. ""They manifest their lack of control in a violent manner against women,"" Dunn said. ""It might not always result in murder, but it often does in physical abuse."" Sondra Miller, who deals with rape victims as interim director of Cleveland's Rape Crisis Center, doesn't think violence against women is any more a problem in Cleveland than in any other community.  She believes that the data show that after years of high-profile cases in Cleveland, more people are willing to report rape and sexual assault. Could it be just something in the city's DNA? Outrageous crimes are not a new phenomenon: In the 1930s, dismembered bodies kept turning up in the city's Kingsbury Run area, a string of killings that to this day remains unsolved. And, as crime author Renner points out, the city was once famous for its burning river, once dubbed the ""Mistake on the Lake"" and branded with an outsized inferiority complex after decades of being the butt of national jokes. ""You live here, you grow up here, and there is some kind of weird vibe in the air here that anything's possible,"" he said. Whatever's going on, Miller says, residents can't help but wonder, ""Why here? Why us?"" as Cleveland's gritty side goes on display once again in the national media. ""I do think we're all asking how this happens in a city I love and care deeply about,"" Miller said. ""We definitely have more questions than we have answers at this point.""","Cleveland is the site of three national headline-grabbing crimes in four years .
Poverty, vacant homes create perfect environment for crime, experts say .
But others question whether there's anything unique about Cleveland .

"If Mitt Romney were to write a bumper sticker slogan for the past month, it would probably be, ""Detroit DID go bankrupt. Russia IS a geopolitical foe."" Reality isn't quite so simple as to perfectly apply recent developments on Detroit and Russia to the American debate in 2012, but neither were Romney's arguments on the car industry and on Russia. That didn't stop Democrats and pundits from using them to beat Romney down. And it would be a good retort to Joe Biden's often-repeated 2012 bumper sticker slogan: ""Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive!"" Biden used the phrase to simultaneously flaunt what the Obama administration accomplished in the war on terror and hit Romney for his position against the auto bailout. Romney had different ideas than the president about the war on terror, and he also had outspoken ideas on Russia, which he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN in March of 2012 was ""without question our number one geopolitical foe."" His statement drew snickers in Washington and complaints in foreign policy circles that he was stuck in the Cold War. Archives: Hillary Clinton criticizes Romney's remarks on Russia . ""You don't call Russia our No. 1 enemy -- not al Qaeda, Russia -- unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp,"" President Barack Obama said at the Democratic National Convention last September. The president probably still wouldn't call Russia this country's top foe. But now that Russia has given NSA leaker Edward Snowden a year of asylum, and the two countries can't find accord on Syria or Iran, he might choose not to put the line in his convention speech. Snowden asylum could cancel planned Obama-Putin talks . ""Now is the time to fundamentally rethink our relationship with Putin's Russia,"" Sen. John McCain said upon hearing news of Snowden's asylum. ""We need to deal with the Russia that is, not the Russia we might wish for. We cannot allow today's action by [Russian President Vladimir Putin] to stand without serious repercussions."" ""Russia has stabbed us in the back,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat. He called on Obama to protest by demanding the upcoming G-20 summit for world economic powers be moved away from Russia. Biden's slogan, ""General Motors is alive!"" drew a direct contrast between the candidates on the auto bailout that Obama engineered after initial action by President George W. Bush. Romney's much-cited New York Times op-ed argued the car industry should be shepherded into a managed bankruptcy and not propped up with taxpayer dollars. The headline of Romney's op-ed in November 2008 was ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."" That headline followed him all the way to November of 2012 when he lost the election. Romney's argument in the opinion piece was directed at the car industry, but it foreshadowed last month's news that the Detroit the city, once the powerhouse of the American economy, was going bankrupt. ""[W]e refused to throw in the towel and do nothing,"" Obama said in a video message in October of 2012. ""We refused to let Detroit go bankrupt, I bet on American workers, and American ingenuity and three years later that bet is paying off in a big way."" A conservative might apply the high labor costs Romney cited as part of the downfall for the auto industry to the cost of government worker pension plans that have helped put the city in trouble. How to deal with promises made to public employees is an issue Americans will face in the coming decades in places far flung from the Motor City. Hatch: After Detroit, replace public pensions . The federal government has made pretty clear there won't be any sort of bailout for the city of Detroit like there was for the auto industry that lives there. CNNMoney: Why Obama won't bail out Detroit . Campaigns are full of little moments like the Detroit and Russia storylines that may have worked against Romney. They add up. More damaging for Romney than either the Detroit op-ed or the Russia as a foe storyline was his statement to fundraisers about giving up on the 47% of Americans who would not vote for him no matter what. This week we also got the most in-depth explanation from Romney on those comments in the form of a book excerpt from Washington Post writer Dan Balz. Romney said he was misunderstood.

"(CNN) -- Two historic cottages in Georgia -- including one that served as a home to Franklin Roosevelt before he became president -- were destroyed by fire Tuesday morning, authorities said. The cause of the fire remained unknown Tuesday, but authorities said it may have been the result of a storm and lightning in the area. The so-called McCarthy Cottage and the E.T. Curtis Cottage in Warm Springs were discovered burning around 5:30 a.m. by an employee who lives near the property, according to a news release from the Georgia Department of Labor. The McCarthy Cottage was the first home built by Roosevelt in Warm Springs, who started traveling to the area in 1924 seeking a solution for his polio, said Georgia Labor Commissioner Mark Butler . The E.T. Curtis cottage was built in 1928 and was adjacent to the McCarthy Cottage. The cottages were part of the Georgia Department of Labor's Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation. The state assumed ownership of Roosevelt's treatment center in 1974, according to state officials. Butler said the nation has experienced a great loss with the burning of McCarthy cottage. ""Because President Roosevelt resided there for four years, the McCarthy cottage was the cottage of most historical value."" Roosevelt lived in the cottage until 1932 when he moved to the Little White House, also in Warm Springs.","Authorities think lightning from a storm may have sparked the fire .

"Struggling for a present for the man who has everything? How about a skinned bear? This was just one of the thousands of thoughtful gifts on display that had been given to the founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung. A present from former Romanian communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, the bear takes a place of pride in an exhibition house in Hyangsan, three hours north of the capital, Pyongyang. Officially named the International Friendship Exhibition House, the exhibition hall is on the official tourist route and crammed full of vases, canvases, military paraphernalia and more unusual gifts. The North Korea I wasn't meant to see . Displayed are 112,225 gifts for Kim Il Sung, his son Kim Jong Il and current leader Kim Jong Un from 184 different countries. By far the biggest donors are China and Russia, and most notably the communist former USSR. The tour begins . A soldier stands guard on both sides of the impressively large entrance door and any cameras, phones and even pads and pens are promptly taken away. The tour can then begin. In the introduction hall, the eye is drawn instantly to a domineering white stone carving of Kim Il Sung sitting in a chair. I am told the Eternal President still receives many posthumous gifts. A sneak peek through the keyhole . Under the ornate and pricey-looking chandeliers are glass cabinets containing some of the more important gifts. The official commentary says, ""enemy countries too sent a lot of gifts to president Kim Il Sung and respected Kim Jong Il, impressed by their great personality and virtues."" Gifts from the ""enemy"" Sure enough, there are a couple of gifts from the ""enemy country"" the United States. Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright gave Kim Jong Il a silver dish when she visited in October 2000. The two countries were enjoying a lull in tensions at the time. In addition, Albright gave a basketball signed by Michael Jordan. Kim Jong Il was reported to be a huge fan of the NBA star. There is also a bowl from former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife who visited in 1994 under the guise of a private trip. Of course, these gifts look rather paltry when I entered the next room and saw an actual train -- a gift from the communist leader of the USSR in 1945. I then noticed the car Stalin gave to Kim Il Sung during the Korean War in the early 1950s. Not to be outdone, in 1953, Chairman Mao Zedong of China also gave the North Korean leader a train. According to the souvenir DVD from the gift shop, 3.7 million visitors have walked through the building's doors from its opening in 1978 until 2010, almost half a million of whom were foreigners or South Koreans. I see a number of North Koreans filing through at the same time as me. Still lacking inspiration for that hard-to-buy-for person from what you've read so far? How about a fossilized snail, given by a former Prime Minister of Madagascar or ivory tusks from Guinea? The tour guide insists most of the ivory in the world is housed in this exhibition, a claim that sounds a little far-fetched but given everything else that I have seen, somehow wholly appropriate.","The exhibition house is filled with gifts from 184 countries .

"As international leaders express outrage over mass killings in Syria -- and lament the inability to pass a U.N. Security Council resolution denouncing the Syrian regime -- questions linger about the two countries behind the impasse. On Saturday, China and Russia vetoed a draft resolution that would have demanded Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stop the killing and answer calls aimed at finding a Syrian-led solution to the 11-month crisis. Analysts say both China and Russia have their reasons to maintain good relations with Syria. Russia is one of Syria's biggest arms suppliers. And China ranked as Syria's third-largest importer in 2010, according to data from the European Commission. ""Beijing's renewed interest in Damascus—the traditional terminus node of the ancient Silk Road ... indicates that China sees Syria as an important trading hub,"" according to a 2010 report from The Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis institute. Even as reports mounted that the Syrian government was killing protesters en masse, the Chinese foreign ministry issued a statement in August noting the ""steady development"" of friendly relations ""over the past 50 years and more."" ""China and Syria gave each other understanding and support on issues concerning each other's core and major interests,"" the statement said. ""China showed consistent understanding and firm support for Syria's position on the Golan Heights while Syria remained committed to the one China position and rendered China staunch support on matters related to Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang and human rights."" Last week, China's permanent representative to the United Nations said the killing of innocent civilians must stop, but also said he is against ""pushing through"" a regime change. An earlier version of the U.N. Security Council draft resolution called for al-Assad to step down and delegate his powers to his deputy, but that element was not in the draft voted on by members Saturday. ""China is of the view that the Syrian people's request for reform and safeguard of their interests should be respected,"" Li Baodong said Tuesday, according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. ""It is imperative to put an immediate end to all violence in Syria and oppose and stop the killing of innocent civilians. ""At the same time, an inclusive political process with a wide participation of all Syrian parties must be started without delay to speed up reform and resolve differences and disputes peacefully through dialogue and consultations,"" he said. Russia also has an economic interest in Syria. The total value of Syrian contracts with the Russian defense industry likely exceeds $4 billion, according to Jeffrey Mankoff, an adjunct fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies Russia and Eurasia Program. He noted the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated the value of Russian arms sales to Syria at $162 million per year in both 2009 and 2010. Moscow also signed a $550 million deal with Syria for combat training jets. Russia also leases a naval facility at the Syrian port of Tartus, giving the Russian navy its only direct access to the Mediterranean, Mankoff said. As Western leaders sought to pry al-Assad from power, Moscow sent an aircraft-carrying missile cruiser to Syrian waters in a show of support last month and shipped Syrian  troops a consignment of Yakhont cruise missiles, according to Daniel Treisman, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles. Speaking after the Saturday vote, ambassadors from both Russia and China said they do support an end to the violence but felt the resolution did not address the crisis properly. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the text ""did not adequately reflect the real state of affairs and sent an unbalanced signal"" to the various sides in Syria. He noted that the minister for foreign affairs will visit Damascus to hold a meeting with al-Assad this week. Chinese Ambassador Li Baodong called on all parties in Syria to restore order as soon as possible. But he said the text would have served only to ""complicate the issue"" and would ""prejudge the result of dialogue."" China and Russia vetoed another Security Council resolution in October that would have called for an immediate halt to the crackdown, which United Nations officials have said resulted in an estimated 6,000 deaths since protests began nearly a year ago. With the Security Council failing to approve a resolution, what happens next is unclear. But as the diplomatic stalemate continues, the death toll in Syria climbs even higher. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists that organizes and documents protests, said the violence has killed more than 7,300.","China and Russia veto a draft resolution calling for the Syrian regime to stop killings .

"(CNN) -- Yet another woman has come forward accusing comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault. Judy Huth filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming sexual battery and infliction of emotional distress during an incident at the Playboy Mansion, according to the documents first obtained by Radar Online. The alleged sexual assault took place in 1974 when Huth was 15 years old. According to court documents, Huth and a 16-year-old friend met Cosby when he was filming a movie at Lacy Park in Los Angeles. After talking with the girls, the suit alleges, Cosby invited them to his tennis club the following Saturday, ""where he served them alcoholic beverages and played games of billiards."" They then went to the Playboy Mansion where, the lawsuit says, Cosby asked Huth to sit on a bed beside him, after she came out of a bathroom. ""He then proceeded to sexually molest her by attempting to put his hand down her pants, and then taking her hand in his hand and performing a sex act on himself without her consent."" CNN reached out to Cosby's lawyer Martin D. Singer but was not immediately able to get a response. His camp has repeatedly and vigorously denied previous allegations. CNN also tried to contact Huth and her attorneys but has not heard back from them. Cosby facing litany of allegations . 'Horrible, horrendous allegations' The suit goes on to call Cosby's alleged actions ""malicious, oppressive and fraudulent in nature."" ""This traumatic incident, at such a tender age, has caused psychological damage and mental anguish for (Huth) that has caused her significant problems throughout her life since the incident."" The case describes the damage as ""substantial and continuing."" Huth is asking for damages and legal fees. Because four decades have passed since the alleged crime, It wasn't immediately clear if the case falls within the statute of limitations in California for child sex abuse. It's because of that lag in time that defense attorney Joey Jackson says he thinks Cosby's legal team will ask for the lawsuit to be dismissed. ""It's highly problematic, and it's likely the lawsuit will not stand,"" he said. With the allegations mounting, CNN political contributor Van Jones said, now is the time for Cosby to speak up. ""At some point, his silence becomes almost kind of an admission,"" he said. ""These are horrible, horrendous allegations."" Cosby has not commented on the allegations, leaving that to his lawyer. In a recent statement, Singer said it defies common sense that ""so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years."" By CNN's count, at least 18 women have gone public with accusations. ""He owes this country. He owes his fans. He owes the women some kind of statement,"" said Jones, who is also an attorney. ""I think this level of silence for this long is unfair to everybody."" Another allegation . The lawsuit dropped on the same day The Daily Beast published a story in which a man named Tony Hogue alleges he rescued a female friend from Cosby's New York brownstone in 1984. The article describes Hogue beating on the comedian's front door after receiving a frantic phone call from the woman, who said, ""Tony, you've got to come get me."" After Cosby answered the door, the story says, Hogue found his friend on the second floor of the home. ""She looked drugged and in a fog, and she couldn't snap out of it,"" he said. ""She was a mess."" The Daily Beast reports this same woman was a witness in a sex assault lawsuit against Cosby, filed in 2005. That case was settled before going to trial. But Cosby does have his supporters. Comedian Whoopi Goldberg said on November 17 that she was skeptical of the rape claims against him by one of the accusers. ""I have a lot of questions for the lady,"" Goldberg said on ""The View."" Her support may have prompted Tuesday's cryptic tweet from Cosby's Twitter account: ""Thank you @WhoopiGoldberg."" .","The alleged sexual assault took place at the Playboy Mansion in 1975 .

"A federal judge has dismissed the racial discrimination claims in a lawsuit filed by a former employee against Paula Deen, the celebrity chef's representative said Monday. The former employee can't claim to be a victim of racial discrimination targeting African-American workers because she is white, U.S. District Judge William T. Moore Jr. ruled.  ""At best, plaintiff is an accidental victim of the alleged racial discrimination,"" Moore wrote. Other aspects of the lawsuit, including sexual harassment and abusive treatment, are still pending. ""We are pleased with the Court's ruling today that Lisa Jackson's claims of race discrimination have been dismissed,"" Deen's representatives said in a statement to CNN.  ""As Ms. Deen has stated before, she is confident that those who truly know how she lives her life know that she believes in equal opportunity, kindness and fairness for everyone."" Paula Deen -- From the frying pan to the firestorm . Deen's career and public reputation went into a tailspin earlier this summer after her deposition in the lawsuit, in which she admitted using the n-word in the past, was released. Dean has insisted she does not tolerate prejudice, but her apologies have failed to suppress the controversy. Former employee Lisa Jackson alleged in the federal suit that Deen and her brother Bubba Hiers committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five years of employment at The Lady and Sons, and Uncle Bubba's Oyster House, two Savannah, Georgia, restaurants run by Deen and her family. Savannah is where Deen built her business and brand into what many consider the folksy face of Southern cooking. Share your thoughts on the dismissal . In the media firestorm that followed, Deen lost lucrative endorsements and her Food Network cooking show, while the publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook was canceled. Jackson's complaint alleged that a ""racially biased attitude prevailed throughout and pervaded defendants restaurant operations,"" and that African-American staff could use the restaurant's rear entrance only. She claimed that a racist atmosphere caused her ""immense personal and work related emotional and physical distress"" because ""employees came to her complain and for help, which she felt obligated to give but was unable to fully provide."" She suffered from the discrimination because ""the conduct denies her right to associate in the workplace with persons of other races,"" the suit said.  It deprived her of ""harmonious working relationships with her African-American subordinates"" and denied her ""the right to work free from racial harassment,"" it alleged. ""There are no allegations that defendant Hiers' racially offensive comments were either directed toward plaintiff or made with the intent to harass her,"" the judge ruled. Deen and Hiers still face the sex harassment allegations by Jackson, who began as a hostess at Uncle Bubba's in 2005 and worked her way up to general manager before she was fired in August 2010. The complaint said the company was a ""boy's club"" with men in management positions, ""and women are not invited to take on substantial decision-making roles."" Jackson contended that Hiers subjected her to sexual harassment on ""an almost daily basis.""","Judge rules Lisa Jackson can't sue for race discrimination because she is white .

"Newtown shooter Adam Lanza was an isolated young man with deteriorating mental health and a fascination for mass violence whose problems were not ignored but misunderstood and mistreated, according to a report released Friday by a Connecticut state agency. The 114-page report released by the Connecticut Office of the Child Advocate profiled the developmental and educational history of Lanza, the young man who carried out the mass killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. The report noted ""missed opportunities"" by Lanza's  mother, the school district, and multiple health care providers. It identified ""warning signs, red flags, or other lessons that could be learned from a review of [Lanza's] life."" The authors of the report relied on extensive documentation and interviews with Lanza's educators and doctors, as well as email exchanges between Lanza and his parents, to make their determinations and recommendations. The report was dedicated to the 20 first-graders who died at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. Six educators and the shooter's mother were also killed in the tragedy that shook the nation to its core and spurred a national debate over gun violence and mental health. Read the report (PDF) Days before . Lanza had not left his room in his mother's Newtown home for three months before the massacre. He was anorexic, the report said, and weighed only 112 pounds the day he died, despite being 6 feet tall. He kept his room locked and his windows blacked out with plastic garbage bags -- communicating little with the outside world, and with his mother only over email. Lanza did find correspondents virtually, in an online cybercommunity of mass murder enthusiasts. In an email dated December 11, 2012,  three days before his attack, Lanza wrote to an unnamed chatter: ""The inexplicable mystery to me isn't how there are massacres, but rather how there aren't 100,000 of them every year."" Despite sharing her worries about her son's condition with friends, the report said it does not appear Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, communicated any concerns to mental health or medical professionals in her final months. And while the report determined that Lanza was not ""obviously psychotic"" in the time leading up to the shooting, the authors concluded that Lanza ""appears to have been on a path to violence for some time.""

The earliest record of Lanza's budding developmental problems appeared in an early intervention pediatric evaluation just before his 3rd birthday that indicated Lanza displayed ""significantly delayed development of articulation and expressive language skills,"" and ""fell well below expectations in social-personal development."" Lanza received special education support in preschool, where through age 5 he made up his own language and was reported to at times ""sit and hit his head repeatedly,"" the report said. Adam enrolled in Sandy Hook Elementary School in the first grade after his family moved to Newtown, the report said. Here, he continued to receive treatment for speech articulation problems, though the report showed that his special education classes were slowly phased out as his social interactions with his peers improved. ""The frequency and duration of services provided should be considered minimal,"" the report said, ""and likely did not have a significant impact for AL's developmental trajectory."" The report concluded that Lanza's treatment suffered from a continual misguided focus on individual symptomatic intervention -- as with Lanza's articulation problems -- while ""the larger issue of expressive communication received little attention, as did other aspects of his rituals and sensory sensitivity."" Lanza was completely integrated into the regular classroom in fourth grade, and by fifth grade, Lanza transferred into a new school, the Reed Intermediate School for grades five and six. It was during this late elementary school period that major mental health red flags were raised, the report said. 'The Big Book of Granny' Lanza and an unnamed co-author penned ""The Big Book of Granny"" for a fifth-grade project. The spiral-bound comic-book style piece, with a purple cover, was made up of violent stories, according to the report, ""filled with images and narrative relating child murder, cannibalism and taxidermy."" ""'The Big Book of Granny' can only be described as extremely abhorrent and, if it had been carefully reviewed by school staff, it would have suggested the need for a referral to a child psychiatrist or other mental health professional for evaluation,"" the report said. Warning signs like the book and Lanza's increasing anxiety were improperly addressed by Lanza's mother and educators, the report said. It noted, however, that ""teachers may have limited training or expertise to identify or respond to a student who may be progressing academically but who is also exhibiting difficulties in social emotional development"" and urged additional training. Lanza's father: He would have killed me 'in a heartbeat' Denial . In a September 2005 visit to the Danbury Hospital Emergency Room for a crisis evaluation, Nancy Lanza described her son to the health care providers as ""having had 'borderline autism' in the past, but having since outgrown it,"" the report said. After evaluation, the hospital crisis team discussed recommendations for therapeutic support and additional psychiatric evaluation, though Nancy Lanza declined the recommendations, stating that Adam ""would be 'better off' at home."" ""The record seems to indicate that they cared deeply, that they tried,"" Dr. Harold Schwartz, a Hartford psychiatrist who co-wrote the report, told reporters in a teleconference, ""but it's not clear that the depth of the issues were recognized and so their response, especially the response of Mrs. Lanza, could appear like denial."" The report concluded that a pattern of accommodation to Lanza's mental health conditions -- rather than addressing his underlying needs -- by Nancy Lanza and certain health care providers, exacerbated Lanza's mental status. The report singled out a period of homebound education during which Lanza was taken out of school during his eighth-grade year as an especially dangerous health care decision that contributed to his isolation and deterioration. ""The level of isolation, disconnect and socialization that we know kids enjoy as part of their education becomes totally lost and that's a piece of what we see in AL's life,"" said Faith VosWinkel, an assistant child advocate and co-author. The report concluded that Lanza's homebound placement was ""inappropriate and nontherapeutic"" and recommended a review of homebound status education and asked the state to consider an audit of existing homebound practices. When and how do parents educate children about guns? Treatment . The report did single out positive health care intervention: ""Of the couple of providers that saw AL, only one -- the Yale Child Study Center -- seemed to appreciate the gravity of AL's presentation, his need for extensive mental health and special education supports, and the critical need for medication to ease his obsessive-compulsive symptoms."" Calls for medication went unheeded by Nancy Lanza, however, whom the authors described as accommodating to her son's aversion to medication. The report ultimately determines that Lanza's mental health issues may have extended past autism to include anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and suicidal disorder. The report says  there is ""no connection ... between [Lanza's] developmental profile and an increased likelihood of violent actions."" And that his ""access to assault weapons with high capacity magazines did play a major role."" The report also noted that it appeared Nancy Lanza made no effort to curtail her son's access to guns in the house in the months leading up to the shooting, despite Adam's severe mental deterioration. ""While we describe the predisposing factors and compounding stresses in [Lanza's] life, we do not conclude that they add up to an inevitable arc leading to mass murder,"" the report concluded. ""In the end, only he, and he alone, bears responsibility for this monstrous act.""

"(CNN) -- After a decade in prison you look at time differently, says Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The former Russian oligarch, whom President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly pardoned in December, is visiting Washington this week, sharing his thoughts with people who knew him back in Moscow -- before prison, before his Yukos Oil Co. was dismantled, before he lost his estimated fortune of $15 billion. Since Putin pardoned him after 10 years in a Siberian labor camp over tax evasion, embezzlement and money laundering -- charges he has continued to deny -- Khodorkovsky has, for the most part, steered clear of direct involvement in Russia's internal political situation. But this hasn't stopped him from criticizing Putin's actions in Ukraine, and arguing that the Russian President is ignoring ""global and strategic challenges"" to his country, ""using his office to avenge a personal grudge."" And Khodorkovsky appears to be taking his concerns over Russia's direction a step further, relaunching Open Russia, a group he founded in 2001 to foster civic organizations. The group was shut down in 2006, its accounts frozen by the Russian government. But Khodorkovsky says he is looking to unite Russians with a ""European mindset,"" a group, he estimates, at around 12% of the Russian public. Yet the prospects for Russian civic life appear dim, at least for now. The reality is that the demonstrations against Putin in 2011-2012 -- protests that drew tens of thousands of Russians to the streets of Moscow and other big cities over what international observers claimed was vote fraud in parliamentary elections -- petered out, with most of the protest leaders ending up under house arrest or in jail. True, protesters took to the streets again in September to demonstrate against Russia's military action in Ukraine, but their numbers were smaller. Stringent laws against multiple demonstrations, as well as new election laws, have made it harder to register political parties or publicly express opposition to Kremlin policies. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has also cracked down on nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from abroad, accusing them of being ""foreign agents."" All this suggests that Khodorkovsky is likely correct when he says the opposition cannot win in 2016. If he's right, it raises the question of how long Putin will rule Russia. Khodorkovsky reels off his odds: a small probability, about 10%, that Putin will lose his position in two years -- ""but he has to make a mistake."" So far, as Khodorkovsky sees it, Putin hasn't made any big mistakes. Even faced with Western sanctions over Russia's incursion into Ukraine, Putin has convinced many Russians ""it's those nasty Americans"" who are trying to punish Russia for its ""independent"" foreign policy. That strategy resonates with many Russians who've confronted economic hardship from time immemorial with a stoic: ""We must endure."" Certainly, Putin appears to have stoked the flames of nationalism and resentment that many Russians still feel after the fall of the Soviet Union. In the long term, this manipulation of emotion, fanned by Kremlin-controlled propaganda campaigns, is dangerous. And, as Putin's more rabid nationalist supporters egg him on to take even more draconian action, it is not clear that even the Russian President can control this explosion of anger. When I ask Khodorkovsky about his likely future role in Russian politics, he denies he's proposing the creation of a political party. It never worked out before and the authorities destroy any competing political structures. His model, he says, is something more amorphous, like what happens during American elections: People come together to solve problems by allying with a certain political party during a campaign with only the ""skeleton"" of a party remaining after the election. Khodorkovsky stops short of saying he would run for Russia's president. But in the same breath, he says he's willing to offer himself as a ""political representative"" to European-minded Russians. ""I will give it a try,"" he says. ""I don't know if it will work out."" Such doubt is understandable. Many average Russians despise him as a rapacious rich man, ripping off the system to amass billions. Some Western-oriented Russians, meanwhile, still harbor doubts about Khodorkovsky's murky roots in Russia's ""Wild West"" capitalism after the fall of the Soviet Union. Kremlin allies still accuse him of having ""blood on his hands"" from vendettas against his early business competitors. So why is Khodorkovsky here in Washington? He says he is trying ""to help people understand"" what he is doing. ""We really don't like it when they say, 'We'd rather see a known Putin than an unknown alternative.' "" Khodorkovsky places the odds that Putin will be out of power in the next 20 years at 90% but adds ominously: ""When he goes, he will not go in a democratic way."" Regardless, it is easy to see why Putin is popular now: Thanks to burgeoning oil prices, he has helped raise average Russians' salaries and fatten the bank accounts of those who run large government-friendly corporations, many of them in the oil and gas sector. In addition, during the Ukraine crisis, Putin has stirred up fear of NATO and the West attacking Russia. But the prospects of someone like Khodorkovsky being there to pick up the pieces if and when Putin's popularity eventually wanes are unclear -- as is whether he would even want to be the one to lead change. ""I hope they will find someone else,"" he adds. ""After all, people who lead transitions like these usually end up in jail,"" he says smilingly, ""and I've had enough of that.""","Former Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky spent 10 years in Siberian labor camp .

"(CNN) -- It was not the sort of meme Bill Cosby wanted to generate. On Monday, the comedian -- or whomever was in charge of his social media -- put out a challenge with a jovial picture of Cosby in a cap: ""Go ahead. Meme me! #cosbymeme."" The Internet immediately reacted, but probably not in the way Cosby expected. ""Claire, have you seen my ... nevermind, found my raping hat!"" tweeted Trill Withers over the cap picture. ""My two favorite things (--) Jell-O pudding & rape,"" tweeted E.J. Coughlin over a photo of Cosby smiling. ""Look at this wacky shirt I'm wearing (--) also I am a serial rapist,"" tweeted Jason Steele over a picture of a thumbs-up Cosby in a patterned shirt. By nightfall, Cosby's original tweet had been pulled from the Web, which led to this conclusion from Jensen Karp: ""If anyone is looking for a job, the Social Media Manager position for @BillCosby is about to open up."" But if Cosby's social media manager has gone underground, in the Internet age -- where nothing ever goes away -- the rape allegations, which Cosby has repeatedly denied, have stubbornly remained in the open. In late October, comedian Hannibal Buress bluntly attacked what he perceived as Cosby's ""smuggest old black man public persona"" by saying, ""Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches. 'I don't curse onstage.' Well, yeah, you're (a) rapist, so I'll take you saying lots of m*****f*****s on 'Bill Cosby: Himself' if you weren't a rapist."" A couple weeks later, Cosby was booked on Queen Latifah's talk show, but the allegations reportedly gave the staff ""cold feet,"" according to TMZ. Cosby's booking was ""postponed at his request,"" the website reported in an addendum. (Cosby did do interviews with Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon without incident.) Now comes the social media fiasco. For years, Cosby has denied the rape allegations. In February, after Newsweek ran an interview with one of the purported victims, Tamara Green, Cosby's representative said, ""This is a 10-year-old, discredited accusation that proved to be nothing at the time, and is still nothing."" Nine years ago, when Green was interviewed by Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show, his lawyer issued a statement: ""Miss Green's allegations are absolutely false. Mr. Cosby does not know the name Tamara Green or (maiden name) Tamara Lucier and the incident she describes did not happen. The fact that she may have repeated this story to others is not corroboration."" In the case of Andrea Constand, who sued Cosby in 2005 over an incident the year before, Cosby says the sex was consensual. CNN has reached out to Cosby's representative for comment on this story, but has yet to hear back. Lawsuit airs allegations . At the time of Constand's lawsuit, Cosby had been in the news for a sexual affair once before. In 1997, a woman named Autumn Jackson claimed to be Cosby's love child. Cosby admitted to a relationship with Jackson's mother but denied paternity. Jackson was later convicted of extortion. However, it wasn't until Constand's lawsuit in 2005 that the comedian was accused of rape. Constand, a staffer for Temple University's women's basketball team, said in her suit that Cosby -- a Temple alum -- had become a mentor to her in the months since they met in 2002. In early 2004, he invited her to his house in suburban Philadelphia. Constand told Cosby she was feeling stressed and Cosby gave her three blue pills, which he described as ""herbal medication,"" according to her suit, which was posted on The Smoking Gun. Then, her ""knees began to shake, her limbs felt immobile, she felt dizzy and weak, and she began to feel only barely conscious,"" the suit continued. Cosby then gave her another drug, she said, and led her to the sofa, where she says she was sexually molested. ""When Plaintiff awoke, her clothes and undergarments were in disarray,"" the suit said. Constand later returned to her native Canada, where she reported the incident to police. Authorities in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, followed up with an investigation, but at the end of February declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence. Cosby's lawyer, Walter M. Phillips Jr., told CNN the allegations were ""utterly preposterous"" and ""plainly bizarre,"" but Cosby later acknowledged his role in the situation. ""Looking back on it, I realize that words and actions can be misinterpreted by another person, and unless you're a supreme being, you can't predict what another individual will do,"" he told the National Enquirer in March 2005. ""I'm not saying that what I did was wrong, but I apologize to my loving wife, who has stood by my side for all these years, for any pain I have caused her. These allegations have caused my family great emotional stress."" Constand filed her civil suit in March 2005. Constand's lawyers said they found 13 Jane Doe witnesses with similar stories. However, Constand's suit was settled in November 2006, and the witnesses were never called. Terms have not been disclosed. Tarnished reputation . As Mark Whitaker's recent Cosby biography makes clear, the man has his demons. He had affairs while on the road and there have been bumps in his long marriage to his wife, Camille. The influence of Bill Cosby . But Whitaker, a former CNN managing editor, told CNN that he didn't feel comfortable airing the rape allegations. ""Basically, I knew that I was going to have to be very careful in what I said about his private life. I felt that way as a journalist and also for legal reasons,"" he said in an interview about the biography. ""In the case of these other allegations, basically because there were no definitive court findings, no independent witnesses, it didn't meet my standard for what I was going to put in the book."" ""I also was very aware that if I just did a she said-he said, and I printed allegations and denials without my own independent reporting, first of all it's not really in the spirit in the book, but also every person who then reviewed or reported on the book would be free to repeat those unconfirmed allegations just because they were in my book. And I just didn't feel comfortable being responsible for that."" Still, the rape allegations are always just a mouse click away. Not long after Constand's accusations hit the media, Tamara Green went public with her claims on ""Today."" A few months later, another Jane Doe, Beth Ferrier, also spoke out. A third woman, Barbara Bowman, came forward in 2006. Green and Bowman both gave interviews to Newsweek in early 2014. How all the controversy has affected Cosby personally is unknown. He's still scheduled to star in an NBC sitcom next year, and his skills as a comedian appear undiminished. Last year's concert movie, ""Far From Finished,"" earned mostly positive reviews, and his recent comedy tour has also received praise. On Saturday night, he appeared at the New York Comedy Festival and played to an appreciative crowd. ""Over the course of a non-stop two hours, he proves himself yet again to be an extraordinarily skilled storyteller, a performer who is acutely aware of his audience and in full of control of the room from start to finish,"" wrote the Guardian's Elise Czajkowski. But his once-sterling reputation has taken a hit. The Washington Post, Salon and The New York Times have all mentioned the rape allegations in stories, criticizing Cosby to varying degrees. And comedian Buress, who later talked about the Cosby allegations on Howard Stern's radio show, said at a St. Louis show that he had asked fellow comedian Dave Chappelle for advice. Chappelle told Buress to talk to Cosby, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. But then Chappelle watched the Buress video. Maybe it's not a good idea after all, he said.","Bill Cosby's ""Meme me"" proposal went awry Monday .

"(CNN) -- If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen -- or so the saying goes. But in the pressure cooker atmosphere of the White House, where world-changing decisions are made on a daily basis, the kitchen could well be the coolest room in the building. The chef feeding the most powerful man on the planet uses few words as she kneads, stirs, and whips; her style likened to a ""baseball coach"" who calmly relays orders through hand signals. ""I think 'baseball coach' is a great analogy because everybody has their own positions, everybody has their own plays to make,"" says Chef Cristeta Comerford, in an accent that wavers between her native Philippines, and adopted home of Chicago. ""You look at everyone's strengths, everyone's abilities and knowledge. So hopefully towards the end of your meal you hit a home run because you're basically trying to rally your team to be the best at whatever they do."" While foul-mouthed celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Marco Pierre White have made a name for themselves as the genius ""enfant terribles"" of the culinary world -- serving up incomparable food with dollops of expletives -- Comerford takes a different approach. ""I think of the skills you need to be a White House chef, talent is number one,"" says the woman who admits if she was to have any other job, it would be as a missionary. ""But at the same time, temperance and the way you treat your co-workers would be up there as well. At the end of the day, whatever you do and whatever your mission is, it's only successful because of your team."" Question Comerford on her famous bosses preferred foods, and her lips are sealed. Perhaps discretion -- as well as talent -- is part of the secret to her success. ""When you work hard as the president, no matter who you are, my job as the White House chef is to make sure that when they get home they're very comfortable, and they're happy with the food they're served,"" she said. ""It's really a matter of knowing each of them individually: Do they like their pizza with thick or thin crusts? What vegetables do they prefer? That kind of thing."" All the president's chefs . For almost two decades, Comerford has worked behind the scenes making sure the president, his family, and high-profile guests are so well fed they needn't give it a second thought -- they have enough on their plates as it is. The 51-year-old has served under three presidents -- joining the Clinton administration as a sous chef in 1995, before the Bush government appointed her to the top job of executive chef in 2005. It's a position she's held throughout Barack Obama's two terms, the president heralding a new era of sustainable and seasonal food growing, different from his predecessors. Before she begins any meal, Comerford now turns to the White House's South Lawn to assess what's on offer -- harvesting fresh vegetables, herbs, and even honey from the hive. ""We have beautiful produce growing basically in our backyard, calling our name and saying 'hey, I'm ready to be cooked today,'"" she says, her voice warm with affection for the patch of land, which since it was first sown by Michelle Obama in 2009, has almost doubled in size to 1,500 sq ft. In a cooking session with CNN Leading Women presenter Isha Sesay, Comerford found inspiration from ""Michelle's Garden,"" picking fresh tomatoes, zucchini, and thyme for a summer vegetable crostata (full recipe below). ""We do a lot of healthy cooking for the First Family,"" says the mother of a 13-year-old daughter. Though in a country where over two thirds of adults are overweight or obese, it seems not everyone is taking her lead. The seasoned chef doesn't measure her ingredients -- ""After 20 or 30 years in the business, all the recipes just kind of get in there,"" she says, pointing to her head. ""It's only the pastry chefs who measure things. The savory chefs, we just kind of wing it. But it all works out in the end."" Salad girl to White House chef . Feeding the U.S. president is a long way from Comerford's first job working as a ""salad girl"" in Chicago hotels -- then a 23-year-old newly-arrived to the U.S. Her older brother Juanito Pasia remembers driving her to-and-from work at the Sheraton hotel near O'Hare Airport in his blue Ford van, where she would make caesar and cob salads. ""Even though you start off as a salad girl, you know I think in every type of work it's always good to work your way from the bottom up,"" says Comerford. ""Because you kind of learn from starting out -- things like organizational skills, and just basic knife techniques."" She later moved to Washington D.C, working as a chef at two hotels, and doing a sixth-month stint in Vienna, Austria, where she learnt classic French culinary techniques. Then in 1995, White House chef Walter Scheib recruited Comerford to work under the Clinton administration. With a change of president came a change of taste, and Scheib was fired by First Lady Laura Bush ten years later, after he ""failed to satisfy her stylistic requirements."" Around 450 people applied for the top job, which went to Comerford -- the first woman and ethnic minority ever to hold the position. Today, of the top 50 restaurants in the world, only three have a female head chef or owner. Stately affair . This ""baseball coach"" and her team of seven chefs need to keep their eye on the ball. At the White House's recent African Leaders Summit, over 400 guests sat down in a lavish outdoor pavilion for a four course meal -- that's 1,600 plates of food timed to perfection. The Pièce de résistance was Halal dry aged beef, raised in Texas, marinated in chermoula -- a garlicky herb blend used in Northern Africa -- and accompanied by plantain chips. It was one of the biggest events Comerford has hosted in her 19 years at the White House, and all the food that can be, is prepared two days in advance . The menu however, is a delicate document requiring weeks of research into different guests dietary requirements, before it is given to the First Lady for approval. ""We still cook American food at its finest -- American regional cuisine and American products,"" said Comerford. ""But at the same time we want to honor our guests by featuring different spices and things that are very dear to them -- hence the plantains."" Home cooking . Growing up as one of 11 children in Manila, Comerford remembers ""everything pretty much revolved around the kitchen and kitchen table. There was always the smell of food, always the sound of food. ""As a third grader we were asked to start wrapping our first spring rolls."" The daughter of a school principal father and dressmaker mother (""she made my wedding gown""), she remembers visiting her grandparents' farm where everything from fresh meat to vegetables was sourced from the backyard. Her kitchen today is still filled with tantalizing aromas -- though now it's more likely to be her Irish chef husband John doing the cooking. After a long day feeding some of the most high-profile people on the globe, Comerford doesn't like to spend longer than an hour on her own dinner. Though she does enjoy a specially concocted Irish/Filipino stew -- ""It's full of potatoes and beef and fish sauce. It's sounds kind of weird but it's really good."" Whether she's also served it to the U.S. president is another matter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- .

"Michaela Cross, an American student at the University of Chicago, has written a powerful account of her study abroad trip to India last year, during which she says she experienced relentless sexual harassment, groping and worse. Upon her return, she says she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and is now on a mental leave of absence from the school after a public breakdown in the spring. Cross, a fair-skinned, red-haired South Asian studies major, titled her story ""India: The Story You Never Wanted to Hear."" She posted her account on CNN iReport under the username RoseChasm. Her story has struck a chord around the world, racking up more than 800,000 page views as of Wednesday morning. It quickly found its way to India, where many readers sympathized with the story and men felt compelled to apologize for the experience she endured. Others called for greater perspective and warned against making generalizations about India or its people. Reaction: Indian women feel sorrow, anger at U.S. student's harassment claims . India's deadly gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi happened a few days after Cross left India in December, and she said that helped others understand what she and her classmates went through. The country has continued to see several high-profile cases of rape and sexual violence cases since then, and the government has introduced tougher laws and punishment for sexual crimes. Keeping chivalry alive in India: Men respond to rape crisis . On her return, Cross struggled to find a way to talk about a cultural experience that was both beautiful and traumatizing, she said in her essay. She writes: . ""Do I tell them about our first night in the city of Pune, when we danced in the Ganesha festival, and leave it at that? Or do I go on and tell them how the festival actually stopped when the American women started dancing, so that we looked around to see a circle of men filming our every move? ""Do I tell them about bargaining at the bazaar for beautiful saris costing a few dollars a piece, and not mention the men who stood watching us, who would push by us, clawing at our breasts and groins? ""When people compliment me on my Indian sandals, do I talk about the man who stalked me for 45 minutes after I purchased them, until I yelled in his face in a busy crowd?"" ""How it feels to be a woman in India"" Later, she writes: ""For three months I lived this way, in a traveler's heaven and a woman's hell. I was stalked, groped, masturbated at; and yet I had adventures beyond my imagination. I hoped that my nightmare would end at the tarmac, but that was just the beginning."" A university spokesman confirmed Cross is a student at the school and would not comment on her mental leave. He said the school is committed to students' safety at home and abroad. Cross said she didn't say anything to the professors on the trip until things reached ""a boiling point"" -- what she called two rape attempts in 48 hours. Should solo female travelers avoid India? Dipesh Chakrabarty, a University of Chicago professor who was in India for the first three weeks of the session, told CNN that he was unaware of Cross' situation. He noted, though, that the university tries to prepare students for what they might encounter while abroad. The Civilizations Abroad in India program was based in the city of Pune, but the students traveled to other areas during the semester. ""Both faculty and staff in Chicago and our local Indian staff counsel students before and during the trip about precautions they need to take in a place like India,"" Chakrabarty said in an e-mail. ""Ensuring student safety and well-being is the top priority of both the College and staff and faculty associated with the program."" The university provided this statement to CNN: . ""Nothing is more important to us at the University of Chicago than caring for the safety and well-being of our students, here in Chicago and wherever they go around the world in the course of their studies. The University offers extensive support and advice to students before, during and after their trips abroad, and we are constantly assessing and updating that preparation in light of events and our students' experiences. We also place extremely high value on the knowledge our students seek by traveling and studying other civilizations and cultures, and we are committed to ensuring they can do so in safety while enriching their intellectual lives."" From India: A different view . Her story sparked a wave of reaction online, with scores of Indians responding, many with sympathy to her plight and pointing out that Indian women also experience high levels of harassment and abuse. Arvind Rao, a media professional in Mumbai, was moved to post this comment on her story: ""It thoroughly disgusts me to be known as an Indian male ...  An apology is extremely meager for all the trauma you've gone through."" He expressed hope that politicians  would ""wake up and implement stricter laws against crime and sexual harassment on women."" ""Every time my girlfriend goes out alone, I pray that she comes back home safely,"" wrote a commenter using the name Jajabar. ""Being an Indian male, I apologize."" Others, however, observed that sexual harassment was by no means confined to India, and Indian commenter Sam1967 warned against condemning his home country when so many others failed to protect the women living within their borders. ""I accept what happened was definitely an embarrassment and a cause of trauma for her that might haunt her for the rest of her life. But this has happened in many other countries or places and therefore it may not be the right thing to single out India."" 'She could have been me': Action urged after Delhi gang rape . Another woman who said she was on the same University of Chicago sponsored trip to India, posted a response on CNN iReport calling on people to resist stereotyping Indian men and recognize that sexual assault happens all over the world. The student, Katherine Stewart, said she dealt with her own share of harassment on the trip, but ""in my experiences in India, I have met a solid handful of warm and honest Indian men -- men who are also college students, men who also love the thrill of riding on a motorcycle in the busy streets, men who defended me at necessary times, and men who took the time to get to know me and my culture. And that should not at all be surprising."" Stewart said she believed Cross ""had every right to tell her story"" and in no way wanted to lessen the significance of her experience. But Stewart, who is black, cautioned that ""when we do not make the distinction that only some men of a population commit a crime, we develop a stereotype for an entire population. And when we develop a negative stereotype for a population, what arises? Racism."" One thing is certain: Cross sparked a huge discussion with a story that she thought no one wanted to hear. She said she is thankful for her experiences in India, and wants to see more international exposure about what women travelers and residents endure. ""Truth is a gift, a burden, and a responsibility. And I mean to share it,"" she writes. ""This is the story you don't want to hear when you ask me about India.

"There have been Christians in the Middle East since the time of, well, Christ. Now that two millennium-long history could be in danger. Islamist thugs have attacked dozens of churches across Egypt in the past few days, burning many of them down. The attacks seemed to be protests against the brutal military government crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood that killed many hundreds of Egyptian Islamists over the past week. Pope Tawadros II, the leader of Egypt's Christian Copts, met publicly with top military officers as they announced the coup that removed President Mohamed Morsy and his Muslim Brotherhood government from power in early July. Christians, who make up 10% of the population, and other minorities had complained that a new constitution that had been passed by the Morsy government infringed on their rights. For some Islamist militants, now it's payback time. According to one report, 52 churches across Egypt were attacked in 24 hours last week. The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights has counted at least 30 churches attacked, along with other Christian facilities. After Morsy was removed from power, a mob armed with axes hacked a Christian businessman to death near Luxor in southern Egypt and then continued their rampage in the village of Nagaa Hassan, burning dozens of Christian homes and killing three other Christians. Today there are more than 10 million Christians in the Middle East and they make up an estimated 5% of the Middle East's population. A century ago they made up an estimated 20%. Much of this fall can be attributed to factors such as emigration and the high birth rates of many Arab Muslims, but some of it is also attributable to the increasing marginalization and targeting of Christians; a worrying trend being seen not just in Egypt but also in other Arab countries. Take Syria. Many Syrian Christians have tacitly supported the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which draws much of its strength from the small Shia Alawite sect and therefore has historically favored and protected Syria's other religious minorities. As a result, the jihadists who have come to dominate a significant portion of the Syrian rebel movement have supplemented their war against the government with attacks that target Christians. On June 27, a suicide bombing in a Christian area of Damascus killed at least four people. Al Qaeda-affiliated rebels are suspected of killing an Italian priest who had spent most of his life rehabilitating a monastery north of the Syrian capital of Damascus and who disappeared last month. The Rev. Paolo Dall'Oglio had reportedly been trying to secure the release of several hostages in the custody of an al Qaeda-aligned group. Meanwhile, in March in Benghazi, Libya, where a militant attack on a U.S. government complex left four Americans dead in September 2012, around 60 Christians were rounded up by extremists and handed over to the government on suspicion of immigrating from Egypt illegally. The militants tortured several of their captives, killing one of them. That bout of vigilantism followed the arrest in February of four Christians accused of proselytizing to Muslim Libyans. The consequence of such attacks and harassment has been an exodus of Christians from the region. Residents of northeastern Syria, where Christians have historically been concentrated, estimate that one-third of the Christians there have fled the country during the past two years. Similarly in Iraq, since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the Christian Iraqi population may have dropped by as much as 50%, according to a CIA assessment. And despite making up only about 3% of the Iraqi population, Christians accounted for half the Iraqis who fled the country in 2010, about 200,000 people. Egypt's religious tensions have a longer history than the recent clashes between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and Christians. Although then-President Hosni Mubarak kept a tight lid on the country's Islamist extremists, clashes between Muslims and Christians erupted sporadically throughout the '90s. But since Mubarak's fall, extremist violence against Christians has picked up in Egypt. In early October 2011, Egypt saw its worst instance of sectarian violence in 60 years, when two-dozen Christians died in clashes with the military. As a result of these kinds of attacks, by one estimate, around 100,000 Christians left Egypt in 2011. This kind of homogenization has happened before in the Middle East, which boasted a sizable Jewish population in the '50s. But with the creation of the state of Israel and the rise of Arab nationalism and then Islamism, the region has become more hostile to non-Muslims. Around World War II there were 100,000 Jews in Egypt, a community that had existed in Egypt since the time of the pharaohs. Now, there are a handful of synagogues operating in Cairo. They are heavily guarded and generally empty as they cater only to the few dozen elderly Jews who are still left in Egypt. One can only hope that this is not to be the fate of the Christians of the Middle East.","Christians have been targeted in Egypt, Syria and Libya .

"In ruling California's death penalty unconstitutional, a federal judge said Wednesday the system is so broken it unfairly leaves inmates with uncertain fates -- often for decades. In his decision, Santa Ana-based Judge Cormac J. Carney vacated the 1995 death sentence of Ernest D. Jones, who petitioned the court to determine whether his death sentence was valid. Carney wrote: ""Allowing this system to continue to threaten Mr. Jones with the slight possibility of death, almost a generation after he was first sentenced, violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. "" The decision will certainly be appealed, said CNN legal analysts Jeffrey Toobin and Mark Geragos. Toobin said no executions could proceed in California while the decision stands. In California, there are 748 people on death row, the most of any state. No executions have been carried out since California put a moratorium on the death penalty in 2006. Four years later, the state sought to execute a  man who raped and murdered a 15-year-old girl, but it was blocked by state and federal courts over concerns about lethal injections. In Wednesday's ruling, Carney called the administration of the state's death penalty system ""dysfunctional."" ""In California, the execution of a death sentence is so infrequent, and the delays preceding it so extraordinary, that the death penalty is deprived of any deterrent or retributive effect it might once have had,"" he wrote. ""Such an outcome is antithetical to any civilized notion of just punishment."" Since 1978, more than 900 people in the state have been sentenced to death row, where inmates spend 23 hours alone in their cells. Of those people only 13 have been executed; 94 have died of other causes. Carney said about 40% have been on death row longer than 19 years. ""California's death penalty system is so plagued by inordinate and unpredictable delay that the death sentence is actually carried out against only a trivial few of those sentenced to death,"" Carney said, noting that it takes an average of three to five years for a death row inmate just to get an court-appointed attorney for an appeal. The judge noted 285 of the people on death row have been there longer than Jones. ""There clearly was a crisis coming. A lot of people have recognized there is a problem with hundreds of people of death row and hardly any executions,"" Toobin said. He noted the situation in California is so unusual it wouldn't affect death penalty cases in other states. California's most recent execution was on January 17, 2006, according to the website for the state's Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation. Clarence Ray Allen, 76, spent 23 years and one month on death row before dying from a lethal injection. He was convicted of orchestrating a triple murder from prison in 1982. Michael Laurence, executive director of the Habeas Corpus Resource Center and Jones's lead attorney, said he was glad that a federal judge reaffirmed what a state commission found in 2008. ""There is no rational explanation, much less any moral or societal justification, for which people are ultimately executed,"" Laurence said in a written statement. ""The execution of Mr. Jones, and the others like him whose meritorious legal claims have gone unheard for decades, serves no valid state interest."" The executive director of Death Penalty Focus said the law in California needs to be changed. ""Justice requires that we end this charade once and for all,"" said Matt Cherry. ""It's time to replace California's broken death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of parole. That's the best way to ensure that convicted killers remain behind bars until they die, without wasting tens of millions of tax dollars every year on needless appeals."" Jones' case is expected to be appealed by prosecutors to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, said. Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for state Attorney General Kamala Harris, said her office is reviewing the decision. Death penalty facts that may surprise you . Jones' case . Jones was tried and received his death sentence at a time when the attention of the world was focused on another case unfolding on the same floor of Los Angeles downtown courthouse -- the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Simpson, who had assembled a legal ""dream team,"" was acquitted; Jones was represented by a public defender. Jones was convicted and sentenced to death for raping and killing his girlfriend's mother, Julia Miller, a 50-year-old defense industry accountant. During the trial, Jones was portrayed as the product of a broken home with alcoholic parents. An aunt described his childhood as ""a living hell."" He grew up in poverty, and his parents used drugs in front of the children and battled violently. His mother beat him and his siblings. He developed a drug habit of his own, which included marijuana and cocaine. He told witnesses that he had heard voices and experienced flashbacks during the year before the slaying. He said the victim confronted him over his treatment of her daughter and pointed a rifle at him, which caused him to flash back to violent incidents in his childhood, according to the state Supreme Court opinion affirming his conviction. The court record indicates that Jones had spent several years in prison for raping the mother of a previous girlfriend. The California Supreme Court in 2003 upheld the conviction of Jones on first-degree murder and rape charges.

"Sen. Rand Paul said Wednesday that experts and government officials are downplaying the Ebola threat, and he speculated whether the U.S. may end up with a ""whole ship full"" of American soldiers infected with the virus. In two interviews the Kentucky Republican and ophthalmologist suggested that the U.S. consider canceling flights from affected countries, and that the border with Mexico is not secure enough to keep infected individuals out. How the Ebola virus spreads . Speaking to conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, Paul questioned whether the Obama administration should carry out its plan to send 3,000 troops to Ebola hot zones in Africa. ""You also have to be concerned about 3,000 soldiers getting back on a ship. Where is disease most transmittable? When you're in a very close confines on a ship, we all know about cruises and how they get these diarrhea viruses that are transmitted very easily,"" he said. ""Can you imagine if a whole ship full of our soldiers catch Ebola?"" Your Ebola questions answered . At a Pentagon press conference, civilian officials said no decisions have been made about the procedures for troops returning to the U.S., even though some are already there, CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr reported. Officials could not say if troops will be quarantined before they return home and if they fall ill how they would be evacuated from Africa. The military is considering converting transport aircraft for the possibility of quarantining troops if needed. They say, however, that the troops will not come into direct contact with people ill with Ebola. Ebola reaches U.S.: A tragedy of errors . Paul, who's laying groundwork for a potential presidential campaign, said ""we should not underestimate the transmissibility of this"" and questioned the validity to what experts have said. He said officials and the government are letting ""political correctness"" stand in the way of serious discussion about the threat. ""It's a big mistake to downplay and act as if 'oh, this is not a big deal, we can control all this.' This could get beyond our control,"" he said. In a separate interview with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck, Paul expressed concern about the lack of security at the border, saying an insecure ""border is not only a danger for national security purposes, it is also a danger for a world-wide pandemic should it occur."" Should we worry? He was also open to talking about canceling U.S. flights from countries where Ebola is rampant. ""If quarantine works within those countries, maybe the countries where it's (a problem), they will have to be quarantined from the rest of the world,"" he said. The number of individuals treated for Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone surpassed 6,500, with more than 3,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. was identified Wednesday in Dallas. He started exhibiting symptoms after he flew into Liberia, an Ebola hot zone. Experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the virus is contracted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, and it doesn't spread through the air.

"ISIS beheaded another Westerner, a British aid worker. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry courted Middle Eastern leaders to join a coalition in the fight against the Islamist militants. And U.S. planes aimed at ISIS fighters near Iraq's capital. As world leaders struggled Monday to come up with strategies against ISIS just days after a high-profile beheading by the Islamist militants, the U.S. military targeted an ISIS position near Baghdad. An airstrike southwest of the city appears to be the closest the U.S. airstrikes have come to the Iraqi capital since the start of the campaign against the Islamist militants, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. A statement from U.S. Central Command described the action as ""the first strike taken as part of our expanded efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions to hit (ISIS) targets as Iraqi forces go on offense, as outlined in the President's speech last Wednesday."" An ISIS ""fighting position"" that was firing on Iraqi security forces southwest of Baghdad was destroyed, the statement said. Meanwhile, more than two dozen nations, the Arab League, the European Union and United Nations met in the French capital, calling ISIS a threat to the international community and agreeing to ""ensure that the culprits are brought to justice."" In a statement at the conference's conclusion, the French government said the participants had agreed to take on ISIS ""by any means necessary, including appropriate military assistance, in line with the needs expressed by the Iraqi authorities, in accordance with international law and without jeopardizing civilian security."" French President François Hollande, who hosted the conference with his Iraqi counterpart, Fuad Masum, said there was ""no time to lose"" in international efforts against ISIS. Meanwhile, the leader of Iraq's Kurdistan region asked for intensified U.S. airstrikes, saying he would welcome foreign fighters and urging Iran and the United States to set aside their differences to fight ISIS. Latest beheading . ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, underlined its barbaric credentials over the weekend -- posting a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines and threatening the life of another hostage from the United Kingdom. It was the third videotaped killing of a Western hostage released in less than a month. The latest killing, ISIS said, was ""a message to the allies of America"" -- a direct challenge to the United States. President Barack Obama announced last week that the United States would lead ""a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat"" and that U.S. airstrikes against ISIS would expand from Iraq into Syria. The United States has said nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to the fight against ISIS, which has seized control of large areas of northern Iraq and Syria. But it remains unclear exactly which countries are on that list and what roles they'll play. Britain won't 'shirk our responsibility' Britain's role in the coalition is in particular focus after the killing of Haines, who was abducted last year near a Syrian refugee camp where he was working. Haines' death ""will not lead Britain to shirk our responsibility"" to work with allies to take on ISIS, British Prime Minister David Cameron said Sunday. Instead, he said, ""it must strengthen our resolve."" Cameron pledged to work with the United States to support its ""direct military action."" He also emphasized that ""this is not about British troops on the ground."" Killer identified? Cameron has vowed to ""hunt down those responsible"" for Haines' killing and ""bring them to justice, no matter how long it takes."" The situation is made all the more difficult by the fact that the man who appears in the video beheading Haines -- believed to be the same man previously shown killing American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- has a London accent. Cameron knows the identity of the killer, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen has reported, citing unidentified British officials. But authorities aren't making it public for ""operational reasons,"" Bergen writes in a commentary for CNN. Cameron knows that the man in the video holds at least two other American citizens as well as other hostages from additional Western countries, and that he is part of a larger group of British hostage-takers working for ISIS, Bergen reports. ""It is a real crisis for Cameron, and it underlines a sobering fact: British citizens have volunteered to go to Syria to fight at 25 times the rate that Americans have done so, when adjusted for population size,"" he writes. Building a coalition . Kerry, who attended the Paris conference Monday, closed out a Middle Eastern trip on Saturday, seeking to win support for the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition. In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Kerry said some nations ""are clearly prepared to take action in the air alongside the United States and to do airstrikes, if that's what they're called on to do,"" but he did not get more specific. Britain has agreed to help arm Kurdish forces, support the Iraqi government, keep supplying humanitarian help and coordinate with the United Nations to battle ISIS. France, meanwhile, began reconnaissance flights over Iraq, the French Defense Ministry said. Two Rafale air force planes took off from a base in the United Arab Emirates, it said. Some nations have also offered to commit ground troops, but ""we are not looking for that at this moment anyway,"" Kerry said in the CBS interview. Iraqi Kurdistan's President Masoud Barzani -- whose Peshmerga forces have taken a significant role in battling ISIS -- told CNN's Anna Coren on Monday that he has not asked for foreign fighters but would welcome them. He also called on the United States to step up airstrikes and said Iran should play a role in battling ISIS. But that can only happen, he said, if Iran and the United States ""put their differences aside."" Iran has rejected any cooperation with the United States to combat ISIS in Iraq, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said on his Twitter account Monday. ""I rejected (the) US offer to Iran about ISIS, because US has corrupted its hands in this issue,"" the statement read. Khamanei accused the United States of planning to use military action against ISIS to ""dominate the region."" Analyst: Obama 'revealed too much' A leading Iraqi expert on ISIS told CNN that Obama may already have revealed more about U.S. plans than he should have to the militant group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ""The mistake was announcing too much of the strategy, and this was a free gift to al-Baghdadi to prepare and counter what has been revealed,"" said Hisham al-Hashimi, who has studied jihadist groups and their evolution in Iraq over the past decade. He suggested ISIS has already begun to take defensive measures, including moving weapons and ammunition into depots and putting elite fighters among civilian populations to avoid airstrikes. The anti-ISIS alliance that the United States is putting together risks driving more terrorist organizations to join forces with al-Baghdadi's group in what they perceive as a ""crusader"" war against Muslims, al-Hashimi said. 'Fighting ideology with ideology' Influential Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia may be crucial in countering that view. ""Help is needed from Saudi and Egyptian religious scholars in fighting ideology with ideology,"" al-Hashimi said. ""This is key to extracting ISIS from the roots."" Last week, Egypt's grand mufti reportedly condemned ISIS, saying that its actions are not in line with Islam. A member of the Saudi royal family told CNN on Monday that he didn't think his country would participate in military operations but would be pleased to see ISIS vanquished in response to its heinous violence. ""I think that with each killing that takes place, unfortunately, every time hopefully the world community will be more united in really eradicating this disease that's really infecting the whole Middle Eastern region and inevitably will be contagious to other countries in the world,"" Prince  Alwaleed bin Talal said. If Obama sticks to the goal of defeating the Islamist extremists, the move will help restore Saudi Arabia's trust in Washington, which has been shaken over the crisis in Syria, he said. Al-Hashimi said he is concerned by the exclusion of Iran -- arguably the most influential player in Iraq -- from the coalition. ""They sidelined Iran, and that is a very big mistake because Iran controls the Shiite militias in Iraq and these militias could sabotage military operations when it comes to logistical support or can threaten the safety of American advisers and trainers,"" he said.

"Samples collected from four patients who recently died have tested positive for enterovirus D68, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is unclear what role the virus played in their deaths. In fact, it's possible that enterovirus had nothing to do with them. The virus is very common, especially in the late summer and early fall, with the CDC estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States. Yet the deaths do raise an alarm because this year has been worse than some other years, since enterovirus D68 has been sending more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. It seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems. As of Wednesday, the CDC had confirmed 500 people in 42 states have respiratory illnesses caused by enterovirus D68. Those infected include Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island. She died September 22 at a Hasbro Children's Hospital, according to her obituary, though it wasn't until Wednesday that the state Health Department announced that she'd tested positive for enterovirus D68. Dr. Michael Fine, Rhode Island's Department of Health director, told reporters Wednesday that the girl ""died from overwhelming Staphylococcus aureus sepsis."" Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria resistant to many antibiotics, while sepsis is an illness affecting all parts of the body that springs up in response to an infection, according to the CDC. That determination notwithstanding, Fine also noted that ""cultures also showed the presence of enterovirus D68."" He explained that the child, who was otherwise healthy, experienced shortness of breath ""and really by the time she got to the hospital, everything fell apart very quickly within 24 hours."" Fine added that ""it's not clear what role the enterovirus had, but clearly (this) was a sepsis death."" ""We don't know which came first, and that's not possible to know with the current state of our science,"" the state health official said, referring to enterovirus and sepsis. Otrando's classmates aren't being tested for enterovirus, in part because ""this is an isolated case"" and the virus itself is not uncommon or, usually, not much more harmful than a cold, according to Fine. ""We live in a world in which there are lots of viruses and lots of bacteria,"" he added. ""... So the issue isn't always, 'How did that bacteria get to one person,' but, 'What were the conditions under which the bacteria overgrew and took over and did (all this) so scathingly quickly?' "" My son was like 'a goldfish gasping for breath' Enterovirus may also be linked to a small number of cases of a mysterious neurologic illness seen in Colorado, Boston and Michigan. Doctors in Colorado spotted it first -- a group of 10 children hospitalized with limb weakness, cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter. Doctors at Boston Children's Hospital have since identified four patients with the same symptoms. And a child in Washtenaw County, Michigan, also developed partial paralysis in the lower limbs after being hospitalized with the virus, the Michigan Department of Community Health said Wednesday. Staphylococcus aureus is a type of bacteria that commonly causes skin infections, pneumonia and blood poisoning. Most staph infections are easily treated with antibiotics, according to the National Institutes of Health, but some strains of the bacteria are resistant to these medications, making them harder to treat. Antibiotic-resistant infections has been a big public health issue the past few years. In September, President Barack Obama signed an executive order establishing an interagency task force charged with developing a national strategy to combat these dangerous bacteria strains. The Rhode Island Department of Health recommends parents and children follow these steps to prevention infection: . -- Wash hands often with soap and warm water five or six times a day for at least 20 seconds. -- Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. -- Make sure your child is taking asthma medications as prescribed. -- Disinfect toys, doorknobs, phones, computers and other surfaces often. -- Avoid close contact and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick. -- Stay home if you are sick. -- Seek medical attention right away if your child is having trouble breathing.","500 people in 42 states have respiratory illnesses caused by enterovirus D68 .

"(CNN) -- On Friday, the Sayreville High School football team was supposed to host a rival team in a homecoming game. But instead of taking the field, seven Sayreville, New Jersey, players were taken into custody, arrested and charged in flagrant sexual assaults on younger players. Many have referred to the incident as pervasive locker room ""hazing."" What allegedly happened isn't just hazing, it's rape. ""It would start with a howling noise from a senior football player at Sayreville War Memorial High School, and then the locker room lights were abruptly shut off,"" NJ Advance Media reported (citing information from the parent of one victim). ""In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker-room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen. Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet"" and sexually abused. If that's not enough to make you sick to your stomach, consider that these attacks allegedly happened several times -- between September 19 and September 29 -- and to four separate victims. Consider that there were dozens of players in these locker rooms who allegedly witnessed the rapes and hazing and did nothing to stop, report or thwart them. One bright spot in this horrific story is Dr. Richard Labbe, the superintendent who acted swiftly and definitively. On October 2, when a parent and student first reported the alleged assaults, the superintendent immediately canceled and forfeited that evening's football game because of a ""serious and unforeseen circumstances."" Over the next couple of days, more information came to light, prompting Labbe to cancel the entire season because of ""incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying as constituted by the definition within the anti-bullying statute that took place on a pervasive level."" His decision was unanimously upheld by the board of education. The only thing more disgusting than these allegations are the reactions of the parents in Sayreville who showed up at the board of education meeting to protest. You only need to read the comments of the mom of one football captain who was questioned by police to understand just how whacked some people are. As she sees it: ""No one was hurt. No one died. I don't understand why they're being punished. I think that the forfeited game was punishment enough."" Seems the denial among some parents is just as pervasive as the crimes going on in the locker rooms. To the parents complaining about lost scholarship opportunities, the fact is that if these charges are true, your son doesn't deserve a scholarship; he deserves jail time. Among the litany of charges, three of the players are charged with aggravated sexual assault, which carries a five-year sentence if convicted in juvenile court. However, the prosecutor could charge all or some of the players as adults, which would mean substantially more prison time, leave them with criminal records and require their registration as sexual offenders. So far, Labbe has handled this crisis flawlessly. So what should he do next? 1. Fire the entire football coaching staff. Many parents are standing by head coach George Najjar, who has brought home multiple championships and run the football program for 20 years. He may win on the field, but he is a loser as a leader. Either he and his staff are grossly negligent for not knowing what was happening, or they knew and did nothing. Either way, it's appalling. What was allegedly going on in their locker rooms is what you'd expect from a street gang or a prison yard, not a high school football team. The coach and his staff are responsible for the safety and well-being of their players and by allowing 60 to 70 high school boys to be repeatedly unsupervised in a locker room, the coaching staff put these freshman players in harm's way. 2. Cancel next season, too. Culture takes a long time to change, unless it's forced to change. There was a pervasive abusive culture in that Sayreville locker room, and my hunch is it's been happening for years. You need to send a message to the players, the parents, the victims and the entire community that this will not be tolerated. And for those players who weren't ""involved,"" guess what: If you knew about the hazing and did nothing, you were ""involved"" and should feel the sting of punishment, too. Sports commentator Shannon Sharpe said something very powerful about the hazing incident involving former Miami Dolphins player Richie Incognito, who was suspended after allegations of pervasive racial harassment of Jonathan Martin. Referring to the players who witnessed the alleged hazing, Sharpe said: ""If you allow Richie Incognito to walk around (the locker room) and use a racial epithet, that all black Americans know the stigma and hate and vitriol that comes with that word -- if you allow him to do that, you're encouraging him to do that."" To change culture, the message must be clear: Abuse, bullying and hazing will not be tolerated at Sayreville, and neither will indifference. 3. Find the truth, the whole truth. The truth will come out. Prosecutors will be calling every player in individually for questioning. Players will be asked under oath about the howling, turning off the lights, holding victims down, who did what, how often, whether there were videos or photos. We are at the beginning of this story, because I am certain it didn't start with this season. A locker room does not go from towel snapping to anal rape overnight. I can only wonder what was done to the seven boys who were arrested when they were freshmen in that locker room. It doesn't excuse their alleged actions if they were victims of similar crimes, but it does help explain why it happened -- perhaps they were taught to do it. If that's the case, they were once victims, too, and it should be part of the facts considered when the courts determine their fate. And to the heroes in this story, the student victims who came forward: Our hearts go out to you, and we are all moved by your courage. It's extremely difficult to stand up to abuse, and there's no doubt you saved future students from the same horrible fate. Your parents must be so very proud of you for having the guts to ask for help. I hope you are also proud of yourselves.

"The next time you find yourself facing some questionable drinking water, look for some cilantro. At least that's what a team of U.S. and Mexican researchers made up of undergraduate students suggest. The research team, lead by Douglas Schauer of Ivy Tech Community College in Lafayette, Indiana, along with colleagues from the Universidad Politécnica de Francisco I. Madero in Hidalgo, Mexico, have been studying the region of Tule Valley near Mexico City to identify cheaper ways to filter water. Mexico City has long dumped its waste water in the valley, and the contaminated water is then used by regional farmers to irrigate crops. Once in the edible foods, heavy metals such as lead and nickel can make their way to consumers, where they can contribute to neurological and other health problems. ""The organic toxins we can take care of pretty easily with a number of different methods, but the only way to really get rid of those heavy metals is to treat them with filtering agents like activated charcoal (like what's found in a Brita filter), but those types of materials are kind of expensive,"" says Schauer. ""They are a little expensive for us to use, but they are very expensive to the people living in that region."" TIME.com: Hazardous haze . After testing various samples of plants from cacti to flowers, the researchers determined that cilantro is the most prevalent and powerful so-called bioabsorbant material in the area. Bioabsorption is the scientific term for using organic materials often found in plants, that when dried, could replace the charcoal currently used in filters. The team suspects that the outer wall structure of the tiny cells that make up the plant are ideal for capturing metals. Other plants, like dandelions and parsley may also provide similar bioabsorbant capabilities. Schauer says ground-up cilantro can be inserted into a tube into which water is passed through. The cilantro allows the water to trickle out but absorbs metals, leaving cleaner drinking water. Dried cilantro can also be placed into tea bags that are placed in a pitcher of water for a few minutes to suck out the heavy metals. ""It's something they already have down there, it takes minimal processing, and it's just a matter of them taking the plants and drying them out on a rock in the sun for a couple of days,"" says Schauer. Because cilantro isn't an essential crop, using it as a purifier won't take away from people's food needs in the region, and the relative ease with which the plant grows also makes it a realistic option for cleansing water. TIME.com: Pollution in utero . So far, the researchers reported success in removing lead and nickel with their cilantro filters, and are studying how well the herb can removed other heavy metals found in the Tule Valley water such as arsenic and mercury. ""We are hoping we can look at how cilantro absorbs those metals, and see if those metals work in some kind of synergy when they come into contact with the biomass,"" says Schauer. ""We need to look at mixtures of metals to see if cilantro evenly pulls all the metals out."" How much cilantro would it take to effective make contaminated water drinkable? Schauer says a handful of cilantro will nearly cleanse a pitcher full of highly contaminated water of its lead content. The researchers are presented their findings at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society.

"The words ""welcome to Leith"" are etched on two wooden boards, nailed to a pair of poles stuck in the grassy North Dakota prairie. With wildflowers immediately to the front, a dirt road yards away and a few stray buildings and trees in the distance, the sign seems appropriately simple for the tiny town. Yet in the last few weeks, Leith has become anything but simple. Paul Craig Cobb wants to transform the town 70 miles southwest of Bismarck into a community that mirrors his white supremacist views. He did so quietly at first, asking residents whether their land was for sale. But recent reports from The New York Times and the Southern Poverty Law Center exposed his mission and turned it into a national story. In an interview with The New York Times, Cobb said he hoped his plans in Leith would ""excite"" white people and ""give them confidence because we're being deracinated in our own country."" ""We've been very, very tolerant about these major sociological changes,"" he said, according to the paper. Stuck in the middle is Leith's lone black resident, Bobby Harper. He's known Leith as a nice, peaceful place where ""everybody got along, we basically could leave our doors unlocked, and there was no fear that nobody wanting to harm us."" Thanks to Cobb, Harper now feels under threat, and he said his townsfolk do, too. ""If he can't love his fellow man, then we ask God to help him with something,"" Harper said Friday about Cobb. ""Because I'm not very happy, and the people in this town aren't very happy."" Leith is part of Grant County, which according to its official website is North Dakota's third largest county by land mass at more than 1 million acres. While the communities once buzzed with activity from nearby railroads, nowadays it's decidedly more quiet. That certainly was true of Leith. The U.S. Census bureau says it has a population of 16 people, though other estimates run higher -- though not beyond 25 residents. Among them is Harper's wife, Sherrill. Her mother grew up in Leith and, today, she and her husband call it home. ""I have roots in this town,"" she told CNN's John Berman on Friday night, alongside Bobby.  ""I have a reason to be here."" Sherill Harper recalls running into Cobb last year and he asked her if she had property for sale. She said no. Bobby Harper said Cobb asked him the same question. ""He has the audacity to even ask me for information to buy land, and his intentions were to harm my way of life?"" he said. ""... That's very, very uncomfortable for me."" How successful was Cobb, who is wanted in Canada on hate speech charges, in buying up the town? The Harpers say that residents have been overwhelmingly supportive of them. But the Southern Poverty Law Center notes that white nationalist April Gaede and her husband claimed, on an online message board, to have property in the town. So, too, has Jeff Schoep -- commander of the Nationalist Socialist Movement, which he describes as the ""largest pro-white organization"" in the United States ""involved in the struggle for white civil rights."" In an open letter to Leith Mayor Ryan Schock, Schoep announced that he and members of his group would be heading to Leith on September 22 and 23 with ""a simple message that Craig Cobb will NOT be ousted from the community."" ""Craig is not breaking any laws or ordinances, and has a right to reside in Leith just as any other American does,"" Schoep writes, just before mentioning how he owns an old meat packing/creamery building in town. He adds later, ""If anything, you should see this for what it is, a chance at revitalizing a community."" These comments have been echoed on white nationalist online message boards such as WhiteNations.com and Stormfront. Posters there have applauded Cobb for ""doing a great job"" and jibing critics as ""laughable, pathetic what this country has come to."" The Harpers have felt their wrath, including a letter they received Friday that read, in part: ""I want you to leave your ""husband"" and go join Mr. Cobb's movement. Do it now! Separation of the races forever!"" The target of that missive, Sherrill Harper, says that's just one of many she's received calling her a ""filthy, race-mixing white woman"" and ""pea-brained."" ""It made me afraid,"" she said. ""If his goal is to just have only white people here, where do my husband and I go?"" Sherrill has nothing but kind words for her neighbors, but that doesn't mean she knows what to do or how this story will end. She admits, ""I think we're unsure as to what to do. We'll just have to wait and see."" Cobb said his friends have bought or acquired some of his plots, but he does not know when they will move to the town.

"The U.N. General Assembly on Thursday approved a resolution calling the Crimean referendum to secede from Ukraine invalid. The vote on the nonbinding resolution was 100-11, with 58 countries abstaining. It's the latest indication of Russia's isolation within the international community over its actions in Ukraine. Moscow formally annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea region last week, days after the controversial referendum in which a majority of Crimeans voted to leave Ukraine for Russia. Adding to tensions, Russia now may have as many as 40,000 troops near its border with Ukraine, two U.S. officials told CNN on Thursday. The officials said that this estimate was largely based on satellite imagery and that a firm number is difficult to assess. However, a spokesman for Ukraine's Council of National Security and Defense told CNN his government estimates 88,000 Russian troops are at the Ukrainian border. U.S. officials said they believe the higher estimates may reflect Russian troops on alert farther to the east. Earlier Thursday, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, released from jail last month, said she intends to run for president in May elections. After more than two years in prison, she was released in February after the ouster of her archrival, President Viktor Yanukovych. She has already been Prime Minister twice before and ran for President in 2010. ""Yes, I am planning to run,"" she said at a news conference at her Kiev office. Tymoshenko said she intended to ask delegates at her Batkivshchyna Party congress on Saturday to nominate her as a presidential candidate. Ukraine's elections are taking place against a backdrop of poor economic conditions, Moscow's annexation of Crimea and rumblings of discontent in the mainly Russian-speaking eastern regions. Tymoshenko's announcement came as the International Monetary Fund announced a $14 billion to $18 billion bailout for Ukraine to avoid bankruptcy. The bailout is tied to painful reforms as the country faces an escalating standoff with Russia. U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday praised the loan agreement between the IMF and Ukraine, and said the United States will do its part to help, too. Speaking with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Rome, Obama said he is calling on Congress to make sure the United States does its part with an economic assistance package to ""support the Ukrainian people as they move forward."" The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine, along with sanctions against Russia for its intervention in Ukraine. Obama said he hopes that Russia will walk through the ""door of diplomacy"" but that its annexation of Crimea means the United States and European Union will increase their sanctions. Earlier this month the House of Representatives approved Ukraine loan guarantees and is now voting on sanctions. Symbol of 'Orange Revolution' With her trademark hair braid, Tymoshenko came to international prominence during the 2004 ""Orange Revolution"" that toppled Yanukovych's first administration. A rerun of the election handed the presidency to her political ally, Viktor Yushchenko, under whom she was Prime Minister. Amid broad disappointment with that government's performance, Yanukovych was again elected in 2010. Tymoshenko was imprisoned in 2011 in a corruption case linked to a gas deal she brokered with Russia in 2009. She served two years of a seven-year term, mainly under prison guard in a hospital in Kharkiv. Many demonstrators carried her picture during mass anti-government protests that began in November and eventually ousted Yanukovych. Upon her release from prison, Tymoshenko, in a wheelchair, addressed crowds in Kiev's Independence Square, the epicenter of the rallies that began when Yanukovych spurned a deal with the EU in favor of closer ties with Moscow. Early presidential elections in Ukraine are scheduled for May 25. Former boxer Vitaliy Klitschko and billionaire businessman Petro Poroshenko are also expected to take part in the elections.","U.N.

"Eli -- a sweet, active, blonde-haired preschooler -- had gone to sleep feeling fine, perhaps dreaming of playing with his sisters or having a fun day at school. He didn't make it through the night. While the young boy died sometime between the night of Wednesday, September 24, and the following morning, it wasn't until Friday night that authorities figured out why: enterovirus D68, a particularly pernicious strain of an otherwise common virus that has been particularly widespread this year. While it's been detected in at least four people who died, Eli's case is the first in which authorities have definitively cited enterovirus D68 as the cause of death. Jeff Plunkett, the health officer in Eli's hometown of Hamilton Township, New Jersey, explained Saturday that, while the boy was born premature, ""he had no other existing condition"" and his parents no reason to believe he was direly ill before the virus took his life. Eli was 4. ""He was asymptomatic and fine, and the next morning he had passed,"" Plunkett told reporters. ""So the onset was very rapid, very sudden. And that's clearly the big difference (between enterovirus D68 and other enterovirus strains)."" Authorities are testing one other child who attended preschool at Eli's school, Yardville Elementary, albeit in a different class, for enterovirus D68. That boy has been treated at  Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and is now recovering at home, according to Plunkett. There are no other suspected cases in the town of 90,000 residents. Nor is there any sign of pervasive sickness at Yardville Elementary or other town schools, with attendance levels around normal. This speaks to the deadliness, the randomness and, in a sense, the pervasiveness of enterovirus D68. Hamilton Township Mayor Kelly Yaede pointed out that his parents ""nor anyone will ever be able to determine where Eli may have contracted this virus."" ""The virus is out in the community, there is nothing we can do about that,"" the health officer said. ""The way to prevent it is from your own personal hygiene and be vigilant with your own children and yourself."" Officials did not disclose Eli's last name during a Saturday press briefing. More enterovirus cases are likely . Just last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or state public health laboratories had confirmed 277 cases of enterovirus D68. That figure has skyrocketed in recent days, to 538 confirmed cases in 43 states and the District of Columbia as of Friday. And there's no reason to think it won't get even worse. As the CDC points out, ""Enteroviruses commonly circulate in summer and fall. We're currently in middle of the enterovirus season."" Not including Eli's cases, tests showed enterovirus D68 in four people who had died. The CDC, though, reported then that ""the role that EV-D68 infection played in these deaths is unclear at this time."" Mercer County's medical examiner, Dr. Raafat Ahmad, was unequivocal about it's part in Eli's death. ""The child had some brain swelling, it had some lymph node swelling,"" Plunkett said. ""But Ahmad attributed that to the virus as the cause of death."" Enterovirus is very common, with the CDC estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States. But it has about 100 strains, with D68 among the most dangerous. Authorities say this strain has sent more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. It seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems. Enterovirus may also be linked to a small number of cases of a mysterious neurologic illness in Colorado, Boston and Michigan. Doctors in Colorado spotted it first -- a group of 10 children hospitalized with limb weakness, cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter . Staff at Boston Children's Hospital have since identified four patients with the same symptoms. And a child in Washtenaw County, Michigan, has also developed partial paralysis in the lower limbs after being hospitalized with the virus, according to the Michigan Department of Community Health. As Plunkett, the Hamilton Township health officer, explained: ""The D68 strain is a very virulent strain of entire that would attack young children, preschoolers, toddlers who have for the most part compromised immune systems. It has a certain target in our population."" Hygiene education, cleaning ramped up in schools . It's not clear, though, whether Eli should have been any more susceptible than anyone else, beyond his age. That and the suddenness of his death makes it especially difficult to fathom or fully understand. People in Hamilton Township, at least, are doing something about it. While officials say they're being careful not to overly alarm students, they are stressing things like hand washing, sneezing into your sleeves, staying home if you're sick and the like to students, teachers and parents to try to prevent the spread of enterovirus D68 and other viruses. Superintendent Jim Parla also said ""we have ramped up cleaning in all of our schools,"" devoting extra staff and hours to ""do cleaning that goes above and beyond what we normally do."" Then there's the matter of taking care of Eli's family, namely his parents -- both educators -- and two young sisters. Yardville Elementary Principal Elena Manning said that blue-and-yellow bows, her school's colors, are being put up around the community in Eli's honor. The late boy's preschool teacher and an assistant bought a girlish bedroom set and rug to decorate his sisters' room at home. And the school will soon have a ""Proud of Me"" wall to display students' work, because Eli would regularly ""ask Daddy if Daddy was proud of him,"" according to Manning. Eli's parents are working with school officials on other things. But their focus now is more on grieving, taking care of their daughters and sending a message to the community. According to Principal Manning, ""They are most concerned about giving thanks, which is incredible.""","Official: A preschooler went to bed ""asymptomatic,"" was dead the next morning .

"Two years into the Syrian conflict, President Obama has decided it's finally time to explain it to the American people in a speech he will give from the Oval Office on Tuesday. But from the beginning, President Obama's strategy in Syria -- if he ever had one -- has been confused. Years of dithering, red lines that went unanswered, and a failure to persuade our international allies and the American public to get on board with the president's nonplan plan, has resulted, not surprisingly, in a confused Congress. On the Republican side, Sen. John McCain was against the president's plan for limited intervention but on Wednesday changed his mind. Sen. Marco Rubio was for intervention in Syria for the past two years, but he cannot support Obama's plan for military strikes. On the Democratic side, many who have previously defended Obama's foreign policy as somehow morally superior to his predecessor for its caution and thoughtfulness now seem delighted to support his new war in Syria. Then there are Democrats who seem a little less fuzzy on their long-held principles and do not support intervening in Syria. Obama's own administration seems confused as well. Secretary of State John Kerry has had to backpedal more than once after contradicting official policy in Syria, which is admittedly hard to discern. Even Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been an awkward spokesman, spending the better part of the past year telling Congress that Syrian intervention was unwise. As Eli Lake, a correspondent for the Daily Beast puts it, ""On Tuesday, Dempsey was not much more helpful for the president's case for war in the Senate. He contradicted President Obama's contention from Saturday that delays would not affect the Syria war plan, confirming the Syrian military was adjusting to press leaks about an early plan."" The confusion isn't merely a consequence of the complicated machinations in Syria or the fog of war. Everything we know now about the Syrian conflict -- that President Bashar al-Assad has been killing his own people, that he possessed chemical weapons, that he had pipelines to Hezbollah and Iran, and that al Qaeda was circling the wagons hoping to exploit the chaos -- we knew in the first week of the conflict two years ago. President Obama is solely to blame for the confusion. His spectacular failure of leadership on the crisis is coming into clearer focus with every passing day. It's possible he just didn't know what to do two years ago, and doesn't know what to do now. Syria is a messy conflict with few good answers. But in piecing together the president's moves in recent months, it's clear he's also very much concerned about protecting his own legacy. That means spreading the blame around to others. First, he made his best effort (at the 11th hour) to get international support for a short-term intervention that -- by his own admission -- was not meant to actually change the course of the war. I call this the beach house strategy. You want to buy a beach house, but can't afford it. So you go in with a few friends so that when the dishwasher breaks, no one person's on the hook for it. One would hardly call that leadership, and it's no wonder few wanted to join us in ""not changing the course of the war"" in Syria. Obama doesn't want to be responsible for the red lines he set either, apparently. He insisted that when it came to al-Assad's use of chemical weapons, ""I didn't set a red line; the world set a red line."" Reactions to this absurd duck and cover were so immediate that the White House dispatched spokespeople to explain the president's contradictory remarks. While it's true that international peace accords bar the use of chemical weapons, it's baffling and shameful that Obama doesn't proudly and defiantly own red lines against a dictator who would gas innocent children in the streets. ""You're damn right that's my red line"" -- would have been a far more impressive and effective message to the rest of the world. Lastly, it seems clear the president doesn't want ownership of his own initial plan for limited strikes in Syria merely meant to punish al-Assad. I can't blame him there -- it's an ill-conceived half-measure that even Democrat Rep. Charlie Rangel likened to being impossibly ""part pregnant."" After insisting he could go ahead with his plan even without Congress, he's curiously allowing legislators to craft his strategy through resolutions and amendments that significantly alter the scope of his plans for intervention. If Obama truly believed his plan was the right one, and is prepared to move ahead without Congress, then why go through the charade of hearings? I would venture it's so that he can later claim that whatever we end up doing in Syria was largely the design of John McCain and other members of Congress. It's a sad state of affairs. With so much at stake -- the stability of the region, the security of our allies, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, 100,000 deaths and Iran watching closely -- you'd hope that the president of the United States would summon the wisdom and courage to take a clear position on Syria, and then accept whatever credit or blame follows. Instead, it seems the president's primary concern in Syria is himself.","S.E. Cupp: President Obama's strategy in Syria has been confused from the start .

"A mother forced to drown her own baby and a prison camp inmate compelled to eat rodents and lizards just to survive -- these are some of the horrific experiences documented by a United Nations inquiry into human rights violations in North Korea. According to the man who headed up the study, examples of ""unspeakable atrocities"" collected to date suggest widespread abuses on a scale requiring an international response. ""What we have seen and heard so far -- the specificity, detail and shocking character of the personal testimony -- appears without doubt to demand follow-up action by the world community, and accountability on behalf of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,"" Michael Kirby, chair of the three-member commission of inquiry, told the U.N.'s Human Rights Council Tuesday. The remarks were contained in a draft report updating the council on the work of the commission, ahead of a final report to the U.N. General Assembly slated for March. Pyongyang has refused to cooperate with the investigation and rejects its validity. Kirby said the interim findings were based on testimony given at public hearings in Seoul and Tokyo last month, from sources including North Korean defectors, former regime officials, survivors of political prison camps, and the families of Japanese and South Koreans abducted by North Korean agents. ""The individual testimonies emerging from the public hearings, of which these are just instances, do not represent isolated cases,"" he said. ""They are representative of large-scale patterns that may constitute systematic and gross human rights violations."" READ MORE: Defectors describe horror, heartbreak in North Korea's labor camps . Kirby said the inquiry had heard ""from ordinary people who faced torture and imprisonment for doing nothing more than watching foreign soap operas or holding a religious belief."" One woman had given an account of witnessing a female inmate forced to drown her own baby in a bucket, while a man had spoken of being forced to burn the corpses of many prisoners who had died of starvation, before scattering their remains on crops. ""The commission listened to political prison camp survivors who suffered through childhoods of starvation and unspeakable atrocities, as a product of the 'guilt by association' practice, punishing other generations for a family member's perceived views or affiliation,"" he said, referring to the account of Shin Dong-hyuk, the high-profile North Korean defector whose horrific experiences were documented in the biography ""Escape from Camp 14. Imprisoned from birth, he said, Shin had eaten ""rodents, lizards and grass to survive, and witness(ed) the public execution of his mother and brother."" Kirby also referred to the testimony given by the parents of Megumi Yokota, a 13-year-old Japanese girl who was abducted by North Korean agents on her way home from school in 1977. Yokota was one of 13 Japanese kidnapped by North Korea and held in a North Korean facility as a way of training spies; the regime has said that she and seven others are dead. International attention on North Korea has previously focused on halting its nuclear weapons program, but, in response to increasingly detailed reports of human rights abuses emerging from the isolated state, the U.N.'s Human Rights Council elected in March to establish the commission. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps in North Korea, as part of a system to crush political dissent. READ MORE: Torture, starvation rife in North Korea's political prisons . Kirby noted that there had been ""rays of hope of change"" emerging from North Korea in the past -- including the regime signing an international convention recognizing the rights of the disabled, and moving to reopen the Kaesong industrial complex, operated in cooperation with South Korea -- but these had proven ephemeral. North Korea had stonewalled invitations to participate in the inquiry, he said, with its official news agency rejecting the testimony as ""slander"" put forward by ""human scum,"" he said. He said the commission would seek to identify which North Korean institutions and officials were responsible for gross human rights violations, but did not clarify the mechanisms through which any prosecutions might occur. North Korea is not a member of the International Criminal Court, but the court is empowered to investigate potential abuse by non-signatories at the request of the U.N. Security Council.","United Nations inquiry looking into human rights violations in North Korea .

"A Columbia University professor who wrote about hate crimes against Sikhs may have become a victim of one himself when 12 to 15 people attacked him while shouting anti-Muslim slurs, police said. Prabhjot Singh, a Sikh and a professor of international and public affairs, said the attackers were yelling ""get Osama"" and ""terrorist"" when they swarmed him Saturday night near Central Park in New York.

The professor co-wrote a 2012 op-ed for The New York Times, saying ""the legacy of anti-Sikh violence and its contemporary prevalence make it painfully obvious that anti-Sikh violence is often purposeful and targeted."" He called for the government to start tracking hate violence against Sikhs specifically, instead of categorizing such instances as anti-Islamic hate crimes like the FBI generally does. The United States is home to about 700,000 Sikhs, nearly all of Indian origin. The men often wear beards and turbans, a tradition that's lasted for 500 years. But the attire and appearance have also meant that they are often mistaken for Muslims, and Sikhs have become targets of anti-Islam attacks. Since 9/11, the Sikh Coalition reported more than 700 attacks or bias-related incidents against Sikhs, including the fatal shooting of six people at a Sikh temple last year outside Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The coalition also cited beatings of Sikhs across the country after the victims were taunted about their turbans or subjected to racial slurs. Sikhism, the world's fifth most popular religion, is a monotheistic faith that believes in equality and service to others, Sikh officials say.

"A federal lawsuit filed Friday seeks to overturn portions of Texas' new abortion law, considered among the most restrictive legislation in the nation, just weeks before it takes effect. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas alleges the law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions. The law bans abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, mandates abortion clinics upgrade facilities to become ambulatory surgical centers, tightens usage guidelines for the drug RU486, and requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services. The lawsuit specifically targets requirements under the new law that doctors obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital, usage controls on RU486 -- the so-called morning after pill -- and mandates that clinics upgrade to surgical centers. The new law ""would be catastrophic, making essential reproductive health care services for many Texans, especially poor and rural women, practically impossible to access, said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive officer of the Center for Reproductive Rights. Gov. Rick Perry's spokesman said the lawsuit was not a surprise. ""It's not surprising that those in the abortion business would oppose these common sense measures to protect women's health and the lives of children,"" said Josh Havens, the governor's spokesman. ""Every abortion clinic in Texas can choose to meet these standards and continue operation. Those that don't are clearly putting profits before patients."" The 20-week ban takes effect on October 29, while enforcement for the rest of the bill begins in September 2014. The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Perry then called the legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill. Davis to run for governor .","The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Austin .

"[SPOILER ALERT: Stop reading if you have not watched tonight's series finale of Breaking Bad, titled ""Felina."" Major plot spoilers ahead.] . They were teacher and student. Master and apprentice. Father figure and problem child. Manipulator and manipulated. Heisenberg and Hoodie. Hazmat-suited partners in crime making fat stacks. However you viewed Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) — and chances are that view changed radically over the last five seasons -- the two men will forever be linked as the heart and corroded soul of AMC's meth-making drama Breaking Bad. The pair's relationship flamed out spectacularly in the final season, as Jesse, realizing that Walt was responsible for the near-death of Brock, the son of Jesse's ex-girlfriend, helped ASAC Schrader (Dean Norris) to (almost) bring Walt to justice. Walt sought revenge, first by handing over Jesse to the neo-Nazis (who gave him two scoops of torture and ice cream), and then by returning from cold and lonely New Hampshire to wipe out Jesse along with Uncle Jack (Michael Bowen) and his crew. But when Walt saw the hideous, ragged condition of his estranged and now-enslaved labmate, who turned out not to be a 50/50 partner in meth manufacturing with these vicious white supremacists, he had an instinctive change of heart and saved Jesse from the hellfire that they were all going down in. What did Cranston and Paul think of the ending of their audacious adventure, which only left one of their characters alive? Read on to find out. Calling it ""100 percent satisfying,"" Paul tells EW: ""There were thoughts I had that maybe Walt will be the only one standing. I love that toward the end, Walt's there to go on a suicide mission and blow everyone up, including Jesse, but he sees what they have put him through. His hair's super long, he's vacant. There's not a soul in him anymore, and [Walt] decides that he deserves a second chance, so he dives on him. He throws himself in front a bullet for him — and it's kind of beautiful."" He adds with a chuckle: ""It's good that Walt got his, because he's an evil, evil man, and he needed to go."" In shooting the scene in which Jesse refuses to shoot Walt, Paul wound up (semi-)fulfilling a desire he'd possessed for years. ""I always had the vision of Jesse pointing a gun to Walt's head, I really did,"" he explains. ""I'm like, 'It's got to end like this,' and deep down, I wanted Jesse to kill Walt. But the closer we got to the end, I realized I didn't want that. Jesse can't kill anybody else — even though he ended up killing Todd. But that was really self-defense and he just had to get out of there. But it's good that Jesse was put through that torture for the past four or five months, put in a hole, because Jesse's not an innocent person. He did some very bad things. It's good that Jesse was put through that so he did some time, but I believe that he deserved to get away from all of it and just leave. You don't really know where he goes ... "" Paul has a few ideas, though, about what happened to Jesse. ""In my mind, he gets the hell out of Dodge,"" he says. ""He's like, 'Oh my god.' I think he probably goes and says bye to Brock, if he can, or at least just sees him from a distance and then he leaves. Maybe Alaska, maybe New Zealand. Becomes a bush pilot. It's all part of the story."" EW: 'Breaking Bad's' Betsy Brandt says 'The ending is good, it's really good' Cranston, meanwhile, feels that Gilligan and his writers crafted both a ""very satisfying"" and ""unapologetic"" finish to this unforgiving story. ""It's fitting. It's complete,"" he tells EW, explaining that the ending gave both characters an appropriate reunion and send-off. ""When I see Jesse, this involuntary sense comes over me,"" he says of Walt. ""He's been treated like a dog -- like a beaten dog — and it just shocks me, and impulsively I protect him. He's going off into the sunset. It's fitting that the man who was so put upon and mistreated has a chance. And I like how it ends, because it's not like, 'Oh, he's got the money.' No. He's just got his life, so he has a chance -- just a chance."" He believes the finale cemented the notion that Breaking Bad is ""a tragedy of almost Shakespearean level. ... Tragedy is not a bunch of bad guys doing bad things: 'Oh, they killed the good guys!' Tragedy is when the bad guys are sympathized, when you realize that it could have gone another way,"" he notes. ""There was hope for them at one time. Macbeth! Oh! In its truest sense, our story is a tragedy — an American tragedy. It's not 'good conquers evil,' it's not 'good guys against the bad guys,' it's much muddier than that. Shades of gray."" Walt's unplanned self-sacrifice in shielding Jesse from the bullet not only exposed what humanity was left in Walter White, but underlined the significance of their relationship, no matter how fractured. ""[When] he hears that the blue meth is still out there, that Jesse is still cooking, it's like, 'That bastard! He convinced them to be a partner with him, he's still cooking! I'll kill everybody!'"" says Cranston. ""And then when I see him, the shred of humanity left in Walter White is exposed at that moment and he acts. So if there's any redeeming quality to him from the standpoint of the audience, it's that moment. He even allows Jesse to kill him. Jesse has the gun and he points at me, and he says, 'You want this?' And I go, 'Yeah. I think it's fitting. Go ahead. You need to do it, go ahead. It's okay.' And then he says, 'If you want this, then do it yourself. I'm not going to do it for you.' At least there was some conclusion to their association. Their friendship did matter. And it was because of that history and friendship, that was the basis of his impulsivity. Because otherwise it would just be, 'Jesus, look at that guy, that poor bastard,' but I'm not going to risk my life for some stranger. There is more than familiarity. It's deep-rooted. And it's so true. Because sometimes you don't know the depth of what you feel until you're tested. That's why I think it's a satisfying ending. It's still true to Walter White. Because he always possessed that. But it's not saccharine sweet. It's not done out of 'Ohhh, Jesse.' It's just ... 'Jesus.' If anything, it makes me hate Jack even more for his brutality."" Did Cranston feel that the meth lord-in-chief ultimately had to die to give many Breaking Bad fans the closure they were seeking? ""Because of his love for his family, there was a thought of mine that, 'Would it be a more perfect hell for him to have to see his family die -- his wife, his son, baby daughter — and he lives?'"" he says. ""And there's some merit to that too. But ultimately, I think this is the best ending. A real satisfying ending. And I'm so grateful for that.""

"Accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's face on the cover of the latest Rolling Stone sparked a backlash against the magazine in social media and in boardrooms around the country. ""THE BOMBER,"" the cover reads. ""How a popular, promising student was failed by his family, fell into radical Islam and became a monster."" The photo of a tousle-haired, thinly goateed Tsarnaev is one the suspect posted online himself and has been picked up by other outlets. A groundswell of criticism objecting to its placement on Rolling Stone's cover emerged Wednesday on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook and among leaders in Boston, where the marathon bombings killed three people, wounded more than 200 and led to a frantic manhunt that left a police officer dead. But some people defended the magazine's decision, saying it draws attention to the story of a young man who seemed an unlikely terrorist. Ed Kelly, president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts, called it ""insulting."" Using Tsarnaev's booking photo might have been one thing, but a photo that shows ""the innocence of youth"" gives the wrong message, Kelly told CNN. ""He gave up any innocence he had on April 15, when he took the life of an innocent child, two women and then went on to execute a police officer,"" Kelly said. ""What he did to a city, a country, we're never going to forgive him for it,"" Kelly said. ""We're not going to cower from it. It disturbs us that our media chooses to celebrate it."" Three prominent New England-based businesses -- CVS pharmacies, Stop & Stop, and Tedeschi Food Shops -- heard the public outcry and announced they will not sell that edition, which will be on newsstands soon. Rolling Stone's most controversial covers . ""Music and terrorism don't mix!"" the Tedeschi firm said on its Facebook page, which carries the cover image with a circle and a line crossed through it. One Facebook commenter said, ""I'm done with Rolling Stone."" The 7-Eleven corporation said Thursday its nearly 1,700 company stores across the country won't sell the issue, and the corporation is encouraging its 5,900 franchise stores to follow suit, according to 7-Eleven spokeswoman Margaret Chabris. She said the convenience story chain will likely resume carrying Rolling Stone after the issue with Tsarnaev on the cover but ""that hasn't been decided yet."" The Illinois-based drugstore chain Walgreens and Rite Aid, based in Pennsylvania, said they won't carry the issue, either. And in a letter to Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino urged the magazine to follow up with stories ""on the brave and strong survivors"" of the attacks and the doctors, nurses, friends and volunteers who helped them. ""The survivors of the Boston attacks deserve Rolling Stone cover stories, though I no longer feel that Rolling Stone deserves them,"" Menino wrote. Did missed connections in murder case open door to Boston bombings? Rolling Stone, critic defend cover . In a statement, the magazine said its thoughts were ""always with"" the bombing victims and their families. ""The cover story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day,"" it said. ""The fact that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is young, and in the same age group as many of our readers, makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens."" Suspect pleads not guilty . While primarily a music magazine, the journal also has forged a reputation for hard-hitting pieces on national affairs, politics and popular culture. For example, journalist Michael Hastings wrote a 2010 profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal that led to the officer's abrupt retirement. In his profile, Hastings quoted McChrystal and his staff criticizing and mocking key administration officials. Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple said Rolling Stone should be out defending its article, because it's ""a pretty easy thing to defend."" ""What you have here is a story about a guy who was very integrated and well-balanced, by all accounts, member of our society until something happened,"" Wemple said. ""We don't know precisely what happened and that was the whole point of this Rolling Stone story -- to account for how he slid off the rails."" He called the companies that are pulling it from the racks ""cowardly,"" noting that The New York Times used the same photo back in May. The photo doesn't glamorize Tsarnaev, he argued, but ""humanizes"" him for people ""who want to see him as an animal from Day One."" ""The facts are he wasn't an animal, at least to his peer group, for the longest time. They remember him as a dear friend,"" Wemple said. ""That's a problem, because he was part of our society and he turned on it by all indications, or allegedly."" Share your view of the cover . The article about the bombing suspect is a deeply researched account, the magazine said in a synopsis about the story, which it published online Wednesday afternoon. Among its revelations: . -- A public plea from his former wrestling coach may ultimately have convinced Tsarnaev to surrender when police surrounded the boat in which he was hiding. -- In high school, Tsarnaev played down the fact that he was a Muslim. But he also took his religion seriously. -- He once confided to a friend that he thought the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks could be justified because of U.S. policies toward Muslim countries. Parents of suspect share phone call with son . Slammed across social media . But Rhode Island-based CVS Caremark Corp. said its decision ""is the right decision out of respect for the victims of the attack and their loved ones,"" company spokesman Michael DeAngelis told CNN. Tedeschi Food Shops, based in Rockland, Massachusetts, said it supports the need to provide news but not ""actions that serve to glorify the evil actions of anyone. With that being said, we will not be carrying this issue of Rolling Stone."" Stop & Shop, a chain of stores based in Quincy, Massachusetts, said it won't carry the latest issue ""due to the public response and our customers feedback,"" spokeswoman Suzi Robinson said. Richard ""Dic"" Donohue, a transit police officer injured in a shootout with the bombing suspects, also criticized the cover. ""The new cover of Rolling Stone has garnered much attention due to its sensationalized depiction of one of the alleged bombers. My family and I were personally affected by these individuals' actions. I cannot and do not condone the cover of the magazine,"" which is thoughtless at best, he said. And the magazine's Facebook post of the cover image had received more than 16,000 comments by Wednesday evening. ""Oh look, Rolling Stone magazine is glamourizing terrorism. Awesome,"" Adrienne Graham commented on the magazine's Facebook page. ""I will NOT be buying this issue, or any future issues."" Others expressed similar sentiments, and words such as ""tasteless,"" ""sickening"" and ""disgusting"" flew around social media. ""What a slap in the face to the great city of Boston and the Marathon Bombing victims,"" commented Lindsey Williamson. But on The New Yorker's website, a column by Ian Crouch speaks out against the rush to judgment and in favor of the magazine. The ""vitriol and closed-mindedness of the Web response to the Rolling Stone cover, before anyone had the chance to read the article itself, is an example of two of the ugly public outcomes of terrorism: hostility toward free expression, and to the collection and examination of factual evidence; and a kind of culture-wide self-censorship encouraged by tragedy, in which certain responses are deemed correct and anything else is dismissed as tasteless or out of bounds,"" he wrote. The cover image was not engineered, he wrote. ""What is so troubling about this image, and many of the others that have become available since April, is that Tsarnaev really does look like a rock star. In this way, the photograph on Rolling Stone is of a part with the often unexpected, and unsettling, portrait of Tsarnaev that has emerged over the past few months."" S.E. Cupp, who will co-host CNN's new ""Crossfire"" program, tweeted, ""To me, seems @RollingStone isn't glamorizing terrorism, but proving that it can look innocent and young and attractive. Important lesson. ""I hope every young @RollingStone reader reads Tsarnaev story, realizes that radical Islam's here, can even infect a young Jim Morrison."" Tsarnaev supporters respond . The cover also brought out comments from the ""Free Jahar"" movement. (Dzhokhar is also spelled Jahar or Djahar.) ""#BoycottRollingStone calling Djahar a monster and stirring the pot even more shame on you! Innocent until PROVEN guilty,"" tweeted @Jahars_Tsarnaev. Authorities accuse Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan of setting off a pair of bombs just seconds apart near the finish line of the packed Boston Marathon course on Boylston Street on April 15. Tamerlan was killed during the police pursuit three nights later; Dzhokhar was captured and charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the attack. He pleaded not guilty to the charges last week.

"How to react to Iran's new smiley-faced president, Hassan Rouhani? Smile back, but don't stop squeezing Iran with sanctions. Rouhani has offered a series of positive gestures since taking office in early August. He has released some political prisoners. He sent New Year's greetings to Jews in Iran and around the world. He took a phone call from the president of the United States. Does any of this portend real change in Iran? The case for skepticism is strong. None of the regime has changed in any way. Iran continues to make mischief through the region, most horrifically by supporting the brutal actions of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. As far as anyone can tell, Iran pursues nuclear weapons as determinedly as ever. Rouhani himself is no liberal and no Democrat. An early supporter of the Ayatollah Khomeini, Rouhani held senior positions in the Iranian state during the regime's most vicious period of international terrorism, the early 1990s - the years in which Iranian-backed terrorists carried out assassinations in Berlin and Paris and carried out two terrible bombings of Jewish targets in Buenos Aires, killing 114 people and wounding nearly a thousand more. As Iran's chief nuclear negotiator in the 2000s, Rouhani nimbly evaded international efforts to achieve a peaceful end to the country's drive for weapons of mass death. More fundamentally, the president of Iran does not govern the country's national security system. The military and the secret police answer to the supreme leader, the Ayatollah Khameini, who has very emphatic geopolitical ideas of his own. Compared with all that, a cheerful tweet and a few words of condemnation of Nazi crimes don't seem much of an offset. So, caution. But there is an ""on the other hand."" On the other hand, sanctions have been biting Iran hard the past year. The currency has plunged in value, inflation rages, goods have become scarce in the shops. Iran's leaders have seen other authoritarian rulers swept from power in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya - and pushed to the very brink in Syria. Has Iran's leadership become frightened that it could fall victim to similar grievances? If anything, Iran's economic situation has deteriorated further and faster than that of any of the countries in which leaders were toppled. Iranian elections are neither free nor fair. But Iranian elections do permit some controlled airing of public grievances. Rouhani has been quoted as saying that he does not approve of Iran's centrifuges spinning while the economy remains stagnant. As so often the case with him, these are very ambiguous words. Perhaps he means that he'd like to accelerate the spinning of both the centrifuges and the economy. Perhaps he is expressing a purely personal and ineffectual opinion. But it's worth the effort to explore whether he and his colleagues might mean something more. Western diplomats often succumb to the Iranian demand that we accept total responsibility for the Iran-West relationship while assigning Iran none. Last week, the New Yorker magazine indulged yet another example of this tendency when it quoted Ryan Crocker, former ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq, as suggesting that we might have reached a deal with Iran in 2002 if only President George W.  Bush had not bruised the mullah's feelings with his ""axis of evil"" speech, in whose drafting I played a role. The hope that some magic incantation might change Iran springs eternal, but states are more thick-skinned than that. They act for deep reasons of interest. Iran's policy toward the West originates inside the regime, and so will any changes of that policy. If those changes have begun, the United States should be ready to recognize and welcome them. But there should be no mistaking why those changes have begun: economic pressure from Western-imposed sanctions and fear of American-backed military action. End the pressure and the fear prematurely, and the changes will end. Iran's nuclear program must be closed down for good. Iran's long record of evasion and deceit requires more than mere promises - we must see decisive and irrevocable proof. Until Iran changes policy, we don't change policy. But if Iran changes its tone, we can change tone, too. A smile is a helpful start, so long as we all understand that it's only a start.","David Frum: In face of Rouhani's moves, U.S. should smile back, keep up sanctions .
He says there's reason for skepticism; Rouhani has history in terrorism-backing regime .
He says Khameini holds the real power; still, there's hope some change may begin .
Frum: Iran has long record of deceit; for progress, nuke program must be shut down ."
"A doctor in rural Liberia inundated with Ebola patients says he's had good results with a treatment he tried out of sheer desperation: an HIV drug. Dr. Gorbee Logan has given the drug, lamivudine, to 15 Ebola patients, and all but two survived. That's about a 13% mortality rate. Across West Africa, the virus has killed 70% of its victims. Outside Logan's Ebola center in Tubmanburg, four of his recovering patients walk the grounds, always staying inside the fence that separates the Ebola patients from everyone else. ""My stomach was hurting; I was feeling weak; I was vomiting,"" Elizabeth Kundu, 23, says of her bout with the virus. ""They gave me medicine, and I'm feeling fine. We take it, and we can eat -- we're feeling fine in our bodies."" Kundu and the other 12 patients who took the lamivudine and survived, received the drug in the first five days or so of their illness. The two patients who died received it between days five and eight. ""I'm sure that when [patients] present early, this medicine can help,"" Logan said. ""I've proven it right in my center."" Two doctors for 85,000 people . Logan is mindful that lamivudine can cause liver and other problems, but he says it's worth the risk since Ebola is so deadly. He also knows American researchers will say only a real study can prove effectiveness. That would involve taking a much larger patient population and giving half of them lamivudine and the other half a placebo. ""Our people are dying and you're taking about studies?"" he said. ""It's a matter of doing all that I can do as a doctor to save some people's lives."" FDA warns companies about fake Ebola drugs . Logan said he got the idea to try lamivudine when he read in scientific journals that HIV and Ebola replicate inside the body in much the same way. ""Ebola is a brainchild of HIV,"" he said. ""It's a destructive strain of HIV."" At first he tried a drug called acyclovir, which is often given to HIV patients to treat infections that occur with their weakened immune systems. But it didn't seem to be effective. Then he tried lamivudine on a health care worker who'd become ill, and within a day or two he showed signs of improvement and survived. One woman walked in, and the Ebola nightmare began . Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says that theoretically, Logan's approach has some merit. Lamivudine is a nucleocide analog, and other drugs in this class are being studied to treat Ebola. Fauci asked CNN to give Logan his email address, saying perhaps his lab could do some follow up work. Logan says he plans to email Fauci this weekend.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Armed gunmen faced off with Kenyan police and soldiers inside an upscale Nairobi shopping mall early Sunday, hours after brazenly gunning down shoppers, diners and more. Around 2:30 a.m. Sunday (6:30 p.m. ET Saturday) -- an hour after reporting five ""visibly shaken"" hostages had been released -- Kenya's National Disaster Operation Centre cryptically tweeted ""major operations underway."" What that meant was a mystery, and it didn't quell fears about what has happened or might happen to an unknown number of civilians who were still unaccounted for inside. The same agency offered an update about three hours later stating that hostages were being held ""in several locations,"" adding there was ""no communications as yet."" By then, government authorities had secured the mall's upper levels, though it was not known where the attackers -- and the threat -- remained. Hours earlier, Kenya's president announced that 39 people, including some of his close relatives, were confirmed dead in the attack. Two gunmen, including one who was detained after being shot, are also dead. Francis Kimenia, secretary to the Cabinet, tweeted another 293 people got treatment at three area hospitals, which ""are appealing for more blood."" The wounded range in age from 2 to 78, the disaster operations center said, urging people to ""remember them in your prayers."" Q and A: Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness . Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia with ties to Nairobi's Eastleigh district and whose most recent attack of this scale came July 2010 in Uganda's capital, claimed responsibility for the carnage and vowed not to negotiate with Kenyan authorities. It claimed that ""all Muslims"" were escorted from the mall before the attack, suggesting its targets were people who didn't believe in their extreme form of Islam. ""The Mujahideen are still strong inside #Westgate Mall and still holding their ground,"" the group said late Saturday via Twitter. ""All praise is due to Allah!"" Kenyan authorities, though, insist they have the upper hand, where it's now early Sunday morning. The last few hours of Saturday and the first few of Sunday, in Kenya, were largely quiet outside the mall except for movement . Police tweeted that the attackers ""have been isolated and pinned down in a room by security forces."" And Joseph Ole Lenku, the national government's cabinet secretary for interior and coordination, hinted that the worst should be over. ""Our security forces have taken control of the situation,"" Lenku said. ""Attackers of Westgate shopping mall have been isolated and pinned down in a room by security forces in the ongoing operation,"" the national police said on Twitter. Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, blasted ""the despicable perpetrators of this cowardly act (who) hoped to intimidate, divide and cause despondency among Kenyans and would like to (create) a closed, fearful and fractured society."" CNN security analyst: Kenya, Westerners high on Al-Shabaab's list . Kenya is no stranger to terrorism, including a 1998 bombing at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi that left 213 dead and other attacks before and since tied to al Qaeda and related groups. In a televised speech late Saturday, Kenyatta said his nation has ""overcome"" such attacks before, refusing to budge from its values or relinquish his security. And it will do so again, he promised. ""We shall hunt down the perpetrators wherever they run to,"" the president said. ""We shall get them, and we shall punish them for this heinous crime. Midday peace shattered by gunfire, blasts . ""Westgate Mall lends itself a serene and safe environment away from the city centre,"" the mall's official website states. That may have been true before -- while there had been warnings, the high-end mall filled with more than 80 stores and restaurants had never been targeted. But it couldn't have been further from the truth Saturday. Rattles of gunshots that started around noon shattered any sense of normalcy among those picking up groceries, savoring lunch and browsing through the racks at stores. Uche Kaigwa-Okoye was sipping coffee when he heard what first sounded like a fallen table, then the continuing rat-a-tat of gunfire. As the gunshots became louder, people began screaming and running for the exits. Gripped by fear: Not seeing attackers was part of the terror . Some went outside, only to turn around and go back into the four-story mall after realizing bullets were flying there as well. Kaigwa-Okoye was among them, joining about 20 people who took shelter for about five hours in a women's bathroom cubicle. ""They had grenades, and it was really, really loud,"" he told CNN, adding that he noticed tear gas in the corridors as well. ""All of us felt like they were close."" As people texted family and friends outside the mall, word spread that nobody could be trusted -- and, even if the good guys could be sorted from the bad guys, the barrage of intermittent gunfire made any escape seem futile. Sara Head, a Washington resident, experienced similar horror in the mall's parking garage. As her car pulled up, she and others heard gunfire -- prompting them to crawl underneath and sneak behind cars before getting into a stairwell. She had company there, including two people bleeding from gunshot wounds. Eventually, the stairwell lights went back on and the door to a nearby supermarket opened, so they dashed through and past a nearby loading dock to safety. ""There was blood throughout the supermarket,"" Head recalled. ""... It wasn't clear if it was OK to exit. I was short of sheep following."" Soldiers crawl under cars, copters fly overhead . By then, the sight of Kenyan soldiers in military fatigues crawling under cars with their guns cocked made clear that the once shiny, pristine Westgate mall had become a war zone. The whirr of surveillance helicopters overhead drove home the point. Police took those leaving the building in a straight line, arms raised in the air. They were all taken to a secluded place for vetting to ensure they were not attackers. The military asked media not to televise anything live because the gunmen might be watching screens inside the mall and therefore take cues on their movement. And everyone else, except for authorities, was urged to stay away as roads and nearby locales, including another shopping center, was closed down. World leaders condemn terror attack at Kenya mall, pledge support . The U.N. Security Council condemned the attack ""in the strongest possible terms,"" voicing solidarity with Kenya while calling terrorism ""one of the most serious threats to international peace and security."" Most of the casualties are Kenyan, authorities said. But the mall is popular with expatriates and foreign nationals, who are among those killed and injured. That includes two dead French nationals, their government said. Likewise, two Canadians -- one of them a diplomat -- died in the attack, according to Prime Minister Stephen Harper's office. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said there were several Americans among the injured but none among the dead, though the wife of a foreign national working for the U.S. Agency for International Development was killed.

"Ebola has orphaned thousands of children in West Africa, and relatives are terrified of taking them in for fear of infection, the United Nations said. About 3,700 children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone  have lost one or both parents to the disease, according to U.N. child agency, UNICEF. In addition to mourning the loss of caregivers in the three hardest-hit nations, the children feel abandoned and stigmatized. ""Orphans are usually taken in by a member of the extended family, but in some communities, the fear surrounding Ebola is becoming stronger than family ties,"" said  Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF's regional director. With Ebola infections skyrocketing in recent weeks, the agency fears the number of orphans could double this month. In the next  few months, about 2,500 survivors will get lessons on providing care to children quarantined in treatment centers. Ebola survivors are considered immune to the disease. ""UNICEF is looking at traditional and new ways to help provide children with the physical and emotional healing they need,"" the agency said in a statement this week. More mental health workers . In Liberia, the children's aid agency said it is training additional mental health workers to ensure children affected by the deadly virus get the support they need. In  neighboring Guinea, plans are under way to provide  psychological support  to 60,000 children and families affected by Ebola. Comforting a child is a 'potential death sentence' ""Ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence,"" Fontaine said. ""The vast majority of the children affected by Ebola are still left without appropriate care. We cannot respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways. We need more courage, more creativity, and far, far more resources."" The U.N. children's agency said  it has received only 25% of the $200 million it needs for emergency assistance for families affected by Ebola in the region. Affected nations are reporting grim numbers as the deadly virus takes its toll. 'Untold numbers of children are dying' In Sierra Leone,  about 765 new cases were reported last week, which is a rate of five every hour, according to Save the Children. The aid group said there are only 327 beds available for Ebola patients in the country. ""Untold numbers of children are dying anonymously at home or in the streets,"" Save the Children said. Ebola has killed more than 3,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and the United Nations says those numbers are vastly under-reported. Meanwhile, Sierra Leone's President Ernest Koroma is missing an Ebola donor conference in London because his British-chartered plane had technical problems, the British Foreign Office said Thursday, an hour before he was due to give a news conference with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.

"(CNN)It's got what many believe is the greatest club football team ever assembled -- FC Barcelona. Not to mention one of the planet's greatest collections of art -- at the Prado museum in Madrid. Then there's the food, which we've suggested is among the greatest cuisine in the world right now. What makes Spain such a cultural powerhouse? Size doesn't hurt. It's Western Europe's second-largest country (after France) in terms of area, and the world's third-largest exporter of wine, fruits and vegetables. But it's the incredible diversity of its people and passions that holds the key to understanding Spain's eternal appeal. More on CNN: ""Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown"" season two . 1. There are many Spains . During the grim decades of the fascist Francisco Franco's rule, regional languages such as Basque, Catalan and Galician were banned in Spain. On the dictator's death in 1975, a new, ultra-liberal constitution broke up Castilian centralism by handing over sweeping autonomy to the 17 regions. The result was a reinvigorated sense of regional pride that had a ripple effect on every form of culture. That's why street signs and menus sometimes come in unfamiliar dialects and languages such as Gallego (Galicia), which closely resembles Portuguese; Bable (Asturias); Catalan in Catalonia, the Balearics and Valencia; and Basque (possibly Europe's oldest language), which remains an unfathomable mystery of x's, k's and z's. 2. Bulls are a unifying force . Despite the diversity, Spain has at least one common thread: bulls. The bull is Spain's iconic animal, and you won't miss seeing at least one -- alive, dead or fake. They famously thunder through the streets of Pamplona each July and snort and kick round the bull rings of Madrid, Seville and countless smaller towns. They also appear on hilltops beside motorways and in a decades-old advertisement for Osborne sherry. Many a stuffed bull's head watches over a bar interior, where aficionados might be glued to a televised bullfight and later scan a review of the fight in the arts, not sports, section of the newspaper. There are areas of resistance to what some see as a barbaric event. The popularity of the bloody contest is waning among the younger generation, and Catalonia has now banned the sport completely. 3. Spaniards don't eat when you normally do . Lunch is from 2 p.m. onward, and dinner comes after 10 p.m. If you're hungry in between or can't reset your body clock, there's help -- tapas and pintxo bars (pintxo is the Basque equivalent of tapas) open around midday and again around 7 p.m. In some bars, a snack still comes free with a glass of beer, sherry or wine, but some places now charge. San Sebastian is Spain's gourmet capital, not only for top restaurants but also pintxo bars. You can make a meal on exquisite miniature dishes and glasses of txakoli (a lightly sparkling dry white wine), Rioja or cider. 4. There's coastline beyond the Costa del Sol . On the Costa del Sol, tales of rampant overpricing and badly designed hotels conflict with the glam, moneyed image of Marbella. The eastern Mediterranean coast is better known for low-cost tourism. But there are still unspoiled beaches where development and commercialism are largely absent. One of Spain's rare volcanic regions, Cabo de Gata is a protected area in the southeast, where black-sand beaches sit beneath Arab watchtowers, monumental rocks and cactus-studded hills. In the southwest, the sandy beaches south of Cadiz are superb for windsurfing. In the north, attractive coves and fishing harbors edge the Bay of Biscay. 5. It snows in the olive groves . Andalucia isn't all shorts and T-shirts. In winter, snows falls at higher elevations, sometimes bringing a surreal vision of olive groves blanketed in white. The peninsula's highest mountain range, the Sierra Nevada is almost permanently snow-capped, creating the perfect scenic backdrop to the Alhambra, the famed Moorish fortress and palace. In spring, wildflowers colonize the slopes, while in the valleys the last olives are harvested. More on CNN: Best of Madrid . 6. Life is just a series of fiestas . Frenetic music, food, booze, dance and dressing up make saints' festivals a highlight of the year in Spain, even in the tiniest of villages. The quirky Spanish imagination -- Pedro Almodovar's movies exemplify it, as do Salvador Dalí's paintings -- gives birth to the parade of grotesque papier mache figures in Valencia's Las Fallas festival and the giant annual tomato fight in the town of Bunol. Seekers of peace and quiet might want to avoid Hellin, in Castile-La Mancha, when 10,000 drummers play for several days. Those of a nervous disposition might steer clear of Ribarteme, in Galicia, when survivors of near-death experiences parade through the tiny village in open-top coffins. When wild horses are corralled in Sabucedo, wine flows all night during La Rioja's grape harvest or flamenco singers carouse into the early hours during Seville's Feria de Abril, you know you can only be in Spain. 7. Under many a church lurks a mosque . Bell towers crowning Spain's churches and cathedrals may appear Catholic, but if you look closely you might discern the form of a minaret, especially in places such as Seville and Cordoba. Iberia's convoluted history brought a succession of invaders and religions, meaning many places of worship were rebuilt using the stones and structures of their predecessors. Roman temples lie deep below, later overlaid by churches, then Islamic mosques and, finally, after the total reconquest of the peninsula in 1492, Christian churches again. The ultimate symbol is Cordoba's eighth-century Mezquita-Catedral, one of the largest mosques in the world, with a cathedral parachuted into its heart. 8.  Easter is more important than Christmas . Easter week (Semana Santa) is easily more important than Christmas in Spain. The whole country shuts down for four days from Holy Thursday at 1 p.m., a rare example of punctuality. Day and night, swaying processions of impassioned penitents in tall hoods and flowing robes advance to a hypnotic drumbeat, carrying crucifixes and weighty life-size statues of agonizing Christ figures and weeping virgins on pasos (floats), while flickering torchlight adds to the electric atmosphere. Andalucian pageants are more animated, with stirring saetas -- spontaneous wails of passion. In the north, although the pattern of parish brotherhoods is similar, the atmosphere is more solemn. 9. There are many layers of ham . Ham scams have become so widespread in Spain that recent legislation introduced new definitions for ham quality. Jamon is a gastro-passion throughout Spain, inspiring fierce rivalry between producers. The most velvety, expensive and sought after variety is jamon Iberico de bellota, from acorn-fed, indigenous black pigs reared in four specific regions: the Sierra de Huelva mountains, in western Andalucia; Extremadura; Guijuelo, near Salamanca, and Los Pedroches, north of Cordoba. At the bottom of the table is jamon serrano, produced industrially from white pigs yet still palatable. 10.  Catalonia may not be part of Spain much longer . Catalans speak another language, have their own flag, are fanatical about cured sausages, nurtured the showman-chef Ferran Adria (of late el Bulli), build acrobatic people-pyramids and, traditionally, dance rather slowly. They're gunning for independence from Spain, with a referendum in the cards for 2014. What they're good at is architecture, art and food -- elements that combine with dazzling grace in Barcelona. 11. You can stay in monasteries -- without taking vows . Back in 1928, the Spanish government decided to rescue its crumbling monuments by converting them into grand hotels, or paradors. These castles, monasteries or palaces in atmospheric old towns or tranquil rural spots soon acquired conquistador-style interiors and a faithful clientele -- there are now 93 throughout the country. The pick of the bunch may be the Hostal dos Reis Catolicos, in Santiago de Compostela -- it started life in 1499 as a hostel-turned-hospital for exhausted and sick pilgrims after their 500-mile walk from the Pyrenees. The pilgrims' goal was the spectacular cathedral next door, allegedly home to the relics of St. James. Beware of loud clanging bells.

"There hasn't been a government shutdown in more than 17 years, since the 28 days of budget stalemate in the Clinton administration that cost more than $1 billion. Now we hear dire warnings and sharpening rhetoric that another shutdown is possible and perhaps likely in less than two weeks when the current fiscal year ends. Despite an escalating political imbroglio, the combination of how Congress works and what politicians want makes the chances of a shutdown at the end of the month uncertain at best. In particular, a rift between Republicans over how to proceed has heightened concerns of a shutdown in the short run, but remains a major reason why one is unlikely in the end. A more probable scenario is a last-minute compromise on a short-term spending plan to fund the government when the current fiscal year ends on September 30. After that, the debate would shift to broader deficit reduction issues tied to the need to raise the federal debt ceiling sometime in October. ""There's going to be a lot of draconian talk from both sides, but the likelihood of their being an extended shutdown is not high,"" said Darrell West, the vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. Government shutdown: Again? Seriously? Conservatives tie Obamacare to budget talks . While the main issue is keeping the government funded when the new fiscal year begins October 1, a conservative GOP wing in the House and Senate has made its crusade against Obamacare the focus of the debate. They demand a halt to funding for the signature program from President Barack Obama's first term, and they seem indifferent about forcing a government shutdown if that doesn't happen. ""I will do everything necessary and anything possible to defund Obamacare,"" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said Thursday, threatening a filibuster and ""any procedural means necessary."" The GOP split was demonstrated later Thursday by Sen. John McCain, who told CNN that ""we will not repeal or defund Obamacare"" in the Senate. ""We will not, and to think we can is not rational,"" McCain said. A compromise sought by House Speaker John Boehner and fellow GOP leaders would have allowed a symbolic vote on the defunding provision that the Senate would then strip out. The result would have been what legislators call a ""clean"" final version that simply extended current levels of government spending for about two months of the new fiscal year, allowing time for further negotiations on the debt ceiling. However, conservative opposition to the compromise made Boehner agree to a tougher version that made overall government funding contingent on eliminating money for Obamacare. Moderate Republicans question the strategy, but fear a right-wing backlash in the 2014 primaries if they go against the conservative wing. In reference to the divisions in the House, McCain said it was ""pretty obvious that (Boehner) has great difficulties within his own conference."" The House passed the tea party inspired plan on an almost strictly party line vote on Friday, setting in motion what is certain to be 10 days or so of legislative wrangling and political machinations. The measure now goes to the Democratic-led Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid made clear on Thursday that any plan to defund Obamacare would be dead on arrival. Instead, the Senate was expected to strip the measure of all provisions defunding Obamacare and send it back to the House. ""They're simply postponing an inevitable choice they must face,"" Reid said of House Republicans. Here is a look at the two most-discussed potential outcomes -- a government shutdown or a short-term deal that keeps the government funded for a few months while further debate ensues. House GOP: defund Obamacare or shut government down . Shutdown scenario . According to West, the ultimate pressure on whether there is a shutdown will rest with Boehner. With the Republican majority in the House passing the spending measure that defunds Obamacare, Senate Democrats say they will stand united in opposing it. ""Don't make it part of your strategy that eventually we'll cave,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York warned Republicans on Thursday. ""We won't.  We're unified, we're together.  You're not."" That means the Senate would remove any provisions to defund Obamacare and send the stripped-down spending proposal back to the House. Boehner would then have to decide whether to put it to a vote, even though that could undermine his already weakened leadership by having the measure pass with only a few dozen moderate Republicans joining Democrats in support. If he refuses to bring the Senate version to the floor for a vote, a shutdown would ensue. ""The key player is really Boehner,"" West said. Polls showing a decrease in public support for the health care reforms embolden the Republican stance. Meanwhile, surveys showing most people oppose a government shutdown and that more would blame Republicans if it happens bolster Democratic resolve. Compromise scenario . Voices across the political spectrum warn against a shutdown, including Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Republican strategist Karl Rove. ""Even the defund strategy's authors say they don't want a government shutdown. But their approach means we'll get one,"" Rove argued in an op-ed published Thursday by the Wall Street Journal. He noted the Democratic-controlled Senate won't support any House measure that eliminates funding for Obamacare, and the White House said Thursday that Obama would veto such a spending resolution. ""Republicans would need 54 House Democrats and 21 Senate Democrats to vote to override the president's veto,"" Rove noted, adding that ""no sentient being believes that will happen."" West concurred, telling CNN that ""you can't expect a president to offer his first born to solve a political problem for the other party."" ""It's the House split that's causing this to happen,"" he noted. ""People now equate compromise with surrender. It's hard to do anything under those circumstances."" Under the compromise scenario, the Senate would remove provisions defunding Obamacare from what the House passes while perhaps making other relatively minor changes to provide Boehner and House Republicans with political cover to back it.","Congress faces a showdown on funding the government after September 30 .

"Few books truly invade a national psyche. When a work manages to do so for 1,000 years, it's a pretty spectacular feat. Enter  ""Shahnameh"", or Book of Kings, a literary epic so large (the largest, in fact) that it measures the length of Homer's ""Iliad"" and ""Odyssey"" combined. It is one of Iran's national treasures, and holds a place next to the Quran in many Iranian households. It is difficult to overestimate the importance of ""Shanameh"" in Iranian culture. Even today, it remains a staple in the canon of bedtime literature read to children. It is among the first books taught in Iranian classrooms. Political candidates will reference parables from the tome in election speeches. As noted by the Wall Street Journal, during the protests that characterized the 2009 elections, demonstrators adopted the chant, ""We are all Sohrab,"" a reference both to a 19-year old victim killed by security forces, and to one of poem's tragic heroes. Almost as impressive as the text itself is the commitment of its author. A Persian poet by the name of Ferdowsi dedicated 30 years of his life to collecting folklore, mythologies and oral histories and turning it into 60,000 rhyming couplets. Today, Ferdowsi has found a disciple in the form of Hamid Rahmanian, a Brooklyn-based Iranian filmmaker who has logged over 10,000 hours illustrating an elaborate new English translation. ""He didn't have a computer,"" quips Rahmanian. ""If he did, it wouldn't have taken him 30 years."" Rather than sketch the book from scratch, Rahmanian crafted together thousands of images of Persian art and painstakingly layered them in what amounts to a 500-page collage. ""I wanted to introduce the visual culture of the Persians and create something modern,"" he explains. Interactive: Press freedom in the Middle East . ""Painting struck me as very passé; no one sits down and paints anymore. I wanted to be like a DJ, but instead of collecting sound and music and changing the tempo or tone to create a new composition, I would use lithographs and miniatures from the 14th to early 19th century."" Sheila Canby, the curator of Islamic Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, has dubbed Rahmanian's version ""the 'Shahnameh' of the digital age"". ""His is both a departure and an evolution,"" she says. ""The book is slick and modern, and very much informed by the visual universe of the internet and TV and film."" Ahmad Sadri, the chairman of the Islamic World Studies Department at Illinois' Lake Forest College, provided the English translation, and  -- along with Rahmanian's wife, Melissa Hibbard -- helped to bring the language alive for 21st century, English-speaking audiences. ""This is the world that has been used to the language of movies for 100 years -- since the invention of American film. The people we are trying to reach are used to fanciful stories like 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars.' I couldn't pretend that they didn't already have that exposure,"" explains Sadri. ""To keep the reader hooked and addicted to the narrative, Melissa and I made the decision to tell a character-driven, rather than event-driven story."" Read more: Arab cartoonists court controversy . While Western readers may have had limited contact with the epic, several of the tales encapsulated in the work should look familiar. In one love story, the hero, Zaul, meets his beloved by climbing up her ladder-like locks. The stars of that tale are also star-crossed in a similar manner to their romantic successors, Romeo and Juliet. Other narratives have elements of ""Oedipus Rex"" and even Tarzan (the orphaned babe raised by wild animals). What Sadri finds most fascinating, however, is the role of women in the saga. ""It's amazing, because they're anything but passive,"" he notes. ""The women in these stories basically hunt and sexually conquer their men. They are advisers -- not shy to offer their opinion. There are villainous women and heroic women."" Perhaps one of the most riveting stories, though, is that of Ferdowsi himself, who after dedicating his life to collecting stories, died bankrupt and embittered. It is a situation that Rahmanian can appreciate. He funded much of the project himself, and during the nearly four years he worked on it,  was pulling in little else by way of an income. Halfway through the project, Hibbard fell pregnant. ""Two weeks before my daughter was born, I had $27.37 in my bank account. I told Melissa take a screen shot,"" he recalls. ""You have to have a certain passion and love and belief to sit down with no money and make something like that,"" he says.","The Shahnameh, a 1,000-year old Persian epic, is a cultural mainstay in Iran.

"(CNN)Copenhagen: not only the capital of the happiest country on Earth -- officially -- but also probably the center of the designer goods universe. Even the Christmas decorations are tasteful. The festive season is also when the air is especially thick with ""hygge"" -- Denmark's wooly, candle-lit version of coziness. No wonder Hans Christian Andersen called the city wonderful -- twice. Yes -- sorry -- that reference was impossible to avoid. 1. The Danes are the happiest people on the planet . It's official. According to the UN's 2013 World Happiness Report, Denmark, with a score of 7.6, beats every other country on a global happiness scale from zero to 10. The United States, by contrast, isn't especially happy. It came in in 17th place, between Mexico and Ireland. But don't despair if you think Danish despair has been lost. There's always Hamlet -- and Kierkegaard (see below). 2. A lot of Copenhageners cycle -- fast . Ever tried commuting to work by bike in a frenetic city such as London, New York or Beijing? Do it and you realize cyclists are still second-class citizens in many cities. The situation is reversed in Copenhagen, where half of the people pedal to work. Just as cyclists compete with cars in terms of numbers, so too they seem to try to beat them on speed. In other words, pedestrians should take care crossing a cycle lane. Or you could join the two-wheeled masses. Cycling is one of the best ways to explore the city, and you can take bikes on trains. Public transport is efficient. It takes 15 minutes to travel from the airport to the city center by metro, and trains run 24 hours a day. Copenhageners are also law-abiding. Even at 3 a.m. on an icy cold night, with no traffic in sight, they'll wait for the green light at pedestrian crossings. 3. Copenhagen is glittering with Michelin stars . It's still hard to get a table at Noma, the ""new Nordic"" restaurant that's been named the World's Best Restaurant three times. There are, however, options. This small city boasts 15 Michelin stars, and several Noma chefs have gone on to set up their own outfits with equally stimulating menus. A flourishing example of the latter is Relæ (Jægersborggade 41; +45 3696 6609), an experimental, basement restaurant on a street packed with food shops and eateries. Another (without a Michelin star) is Kødbyens Fiskebar (Flæsketorvet 100; +45 3215 5656), a stripped-back industrial space that specializes in fish and seafood. Other top Copenhagen culinary stops include Aamanns Deli & Take Away (Øster Farimagsgade 10; +45 3555 3344) where smørrebrød, the classic Danish open sandwich, is turned into a delicious work of art, and the Royal Smushi Cafe (Amagertorv 6; +45 3312 1122), which serves ""smushi,"" a fusion of sushi and smørrebrød. Make dining reservations early -- most restaurants open for online bookings at least two months in advance. Copenhageners tend not to dine late, meaning not a lot of places keep late hours. 4. ""Hygge"" is highly desirable . This Danish word (pronounced ""hooga"") loosely translates as ""coziness."" It's a warm, sociable feeling that comes to the fore in autumn and winter and that, for Danes, is one of the highest states to which humans can aspire. Wool sweaters (preferably organic), hats with earflaps, blazing log fires, strong ales in old wood-paneled bars and candles galore, even at breakfast, all conjure ""hygge."" 5. Home is where the Danish designer goods are . Copenhagen is rich with design-led stores selling trendy lights, ingenious kitchenware, cheerful home furnishings and exquisite glass and ceramics. These five shops are worth a visit: . Hay (Nytorv 9) Now in its 11th year, this purveyor of simple but good-looking furniture and accessories epitomizes the Danish dream to be ""solid, straightforward, joyful and functional."" Royal Copenhagen (Amagertorv 6) Founded in 1775, this august company is best known for its classic blue and white hand-painted dinnerware. Close by are Georg Jensen (Amagertorv 4), renowned for silver cutlery and jewelry, and Ilums Bolighus (Amagertorv 10), a department store devoted to Danish-designed home items. Normann Copenhagen (Østerbrogade 70) This cinema-turned-interiors-emporium in the affluent Østerbro neighborhood is youthful and light -- anyone fancy a bright blue bowl in bendable rubber? 6. Copenhagen is extra-green . The Danish capital has electric buses, recycling-crazy citizens, clean harbors and shops selling clothes made from organic bamboo. A full 64% of the city's hotel rooms are certified as eco-friendly. Three-quarters of the food served in public institutions is organic. Next year, Copenhagen will be the 2014 European Green Capital, an award that recognizes cities with consistently high environmental standards. This is only the beginning: By 2025, Copenhagen plans to be the world's first carbon-neutral capital. 7. Tivoli will suck you in . Opened in 1843, Tivoli is the world's second-oldest amusement park and a much-loved attraction in this family-friendly city. Set inside mature gardens with a lake and playgrounds, it's a schmaltzy but happy place with roller coaster rides, pantomime shows, treat stalls, amusement arcades and more than 40 places to eat and drink. Tivoli is open in summer from April 10 until September 21, then again for Halloween (October 11-27) and Christmas (November 15-December 31), when it sparkles with 2 million fairy lights. Children under 8 get in free; for those over 8, it's DKK95 ($16) a head. 8. The Danes are clever clogs . The Danes invented lots of things we didn't know needed inventing. Like the pedal bin, created by Holger Nielsen in 1939 for his wife's hairdressing salon. You can pick one up at the family's Vipp flagship store (Ny Østergade 34) -- your trash will thank you. They also largely invented existentialist angst -- the flip side of all that happiness. Professionally gloomy philosopher Søren Kierkegaard was born here in 1813 and the city is busy celebrating with a host of bicentennial exhibitions and events. Finally, of course, Lego. A marvelous Danish idea -- until you step on one with your bare feet. 9. Denmark doesn't have the euro . It's a surprise to many, but Denmark isn't on the euro, but the krone (crown). Bank notes bear more pictures of bridges and historic finds than famous people -- typical of a nation that values construction and craftsmanship over ego. Tipping is minimal. Restaurant bills normally include a service charge and taxi drivers don't expect a tip, although it's customary to round up the amount. 10. Christmas and New Year's is a great time to go . The holidays are when Copenhagen is in full festive mood -- and of course it's all done very tastefully. The Danes prefer white lights on their Christmas trees, rather than gaudy colors, and the Christmas markets, which start in mid-November, aren't as tacky or commercial as elsewhere. Alongside the expected designer candle holders and licorice candies (a national obsession), you'll find stalls selling wholesome gifts such as Inuit jewelry, high-tech kitchen utensils and sensible wooden toys. A white Christmas isn't guaranteed, but snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures are a winter staple. Good boots, a warm hat, ""gløgg"" (mulled wine) and ""julebryg"" (specially brewed Yuletide beer) -- these are the seasonal staples.","Copenhagen is the capital of what is officially the happiest country on Earth .
No wonder its citizens love ""hygge"" -- coziness with earflaps .

"A day care worker in Ohio is accused of raping two of the children she was trusted to care for. Heather Koon, 25, was arrested Friday at her home in Oberlin and charged with two counts of rape, the Lorain County Sheriff's Office announced in a statement. Koon was a full-time employee of ABC Kidz Childcare in Elyria from August 2012 to March, according to Carlos Johnson, the day care's attorney. According to Johnson, authorities inadvertently learned of the alleged rapes late last week when they went to check on a registered sex offender and found an unregistered laptop. Koon was the sex offender's girlfriend, according to CNN affiliate WKYC. Johnson said the laptop contained videos of the alleged rapes. He said the day care's administrator called the parents of the two alleged victims on Friday to notify them. ""It's a tragic allegation, and we hope it is untrue,"" Johnson told CNN. He added that the day care is fully cooperating with the investigation and that Koon passed both state and federal background checks prior to her employment. ""She was just re-certified in January,"" he said. Johnson said Koon went to another day care after she left ABC Kidz Childcare.

"Earlier this month during Holi, the Indian festival of colors, more than three million Twitter followers of the Indian prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi received a personalized greeting from him. Others received celebratory recorded phone messages that concluded with an appeal to vote. In another online campaign, supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were urged to donate a tweet or Facebook status to the newly formed anti-corruption party. Social media has become the new election battleground for India's nationwide parliamentary elections, which started Monday. A bevy of politicians, who, at first sight, seem antiquated and traditional in their flowing kurtas and Gandhi caps are turning to social networking sites to engage Internet-savvy first time voters. Having an official YouTube channel or an active Facebook page is now as important as holding mass rallies and plastering candidates' faces on billboards. Some are borrowing strategies employed by U.S. President Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign, with the use of Thunderclap, an online platform which helps to make content viral. There are more than 200 million Internet users in India. Most of them are young and mobile urban dwellers. This demographic is also socially engaged, making for the highest Twitter and Facebook usage in the world, outside of the United States, according to Alexa Internet. These numbers might justify the social push by political parties as a persuasion tool. However, with large parts of the country still without Internet and mobile, the impact of these campaigns on election results remains to be seen. Social media: The new election battleground . In February, Modi appeared on a giant screen across tea stalls in the country, with a beloved Indian staple in his hand -- a cup of tea. This was BJP's ""Chai Pe Charcha"" (discussion over tea) campaign, where satellite and mobile technologies were used to host live interactions with people. In this flood of online political campaigning, the BJP's strategy has been effective, said Kapil Gupta, founder of OMLogic, an online media agency. ""They have hired experts and given them full liberty to manage their social media,"" he said. ""Some campaigns are not just for promotions, but to create conversations."" A Facebook tracker designed to show how much users are talking about candidates and parties showed more buzz for the BJP over rivals. But Modi is not the only one as scores of political parties have turned to Facebook interviews, mobile crowd sourcing, or hashtag wars on Twitter. Activist-turned-politician Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party, which made its debut in Delhi assembly elections earlier this year, have been using social media to draw swathes of supporters. The anti-corruption party has a Facebook page for every single constituency in the capital. A study by the Center for Media Studies estimates this year's total election spending to reach $5 billion -- three times higher than the previous elections in 2009. This sum is being compared to the $7 billion that the U.S. spent in its last presidential elections. According to a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), political parties are typically spending 2 to 5% of their budget on fueling their online presence. The social media strategy of the ruling Congress Party doesn't appear to be as aggressive. At a time when Twitter has become politicians' latest fighting weapon, both the party president, Sonia Gandhi and her son, Rahul Gandhi, 43, are conspicuous by their absence on the microblogging site. Many of the party members, however, are active tweeters. But one notable campaign by the party has been the wide use of the mobile messaging platform, WhatsApp, both for internal communication and relaying party updates. Google is helping all political parties with their online strategy by organizing weekly hangouts with politicians. In the past, India's political class mostly interacted with the public only through campaign trails, mass rallies and media interviews. The search engine has also developed a dedicated election hub, and a ""Pledge to Vote"" interactive map. ""We wanted to engage with first time voters and inspire different age groups to go out and vote,"" said Sandeep Menon, director of marketing at Google India. ""We have over half a million pledges so far and they are coming from all parts of India."" This trend is largely to do with changing voter demographics. Out of the massive electorate, more than 20 million are first timers in the age group of 18 and 19. Will it work? The IAMAI report estimates there could be a vote swing of 3 to 4% in 24 states -- states with significant numbers of Internet users. These could be young men or non-working women who are active social media users. However, a major reason for dissent is India's notoriously weak Internet infrastructure. Most of India's rural belt still lives in an offline world of SMS and faxes. A report by McKinsey found rural Internet penetration to be just one twelfth of urban penetration rates. Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, New Delhi-based independent political analyst, says that with the digital divide in India, the impact of online campaigns remains constrained. ""Let's not exaggerate the influence of social media to influence Indian society in general, and politics in particular,"" he said. ""One of four people in India has never used the Internet; they are just beginning to use a mobile. The impact, as of now, remains limited largely to urban areas and well-off sections of society."" Political parties have tried to get past this hurdle in their campaigns by using mobiles to target the rural voters. The BJP allows potential supporters to SMS their voter registration number to receive voting assistance. The AAP adopted a ""missed call"" initiative during the Delhi elections and has continued with it in the run up to the national elections. Anyone can register as a party member or a volunteer by simply calling a designated number and hanging up after one ring. Regardless of the reasoned debate around its worth, social media is paving the way for a further ""democratization of politics"" in the world's biggest democracy, says Gupta. ""Earlier, elections in India were governed by either the rich class or the rural poor,"" he said. ""Now, even the middle class is interested, and social media is where they can express their opinion and talk.""","According to estimates, India will spend close to $5 billion in the 2014 elections .
Twitter, Facebook, Google Hangouts and mobile crowd sourcing are proving vital .
More than 20 million are first-time voters between 18-19 years ."
"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Saturday that ""most [Department of Defense] civilians placed on emergency furlough during the government shutdown will be asked to return to work beginning next week."" Under Secretary of Defense Robert F. Hale said close to 90% of the 350,000 members of the civilian workforce will be called back. ""My guess is that we will bring most of them back and no more than a few tens of thousands will remain on furlough. And it may be substantially less than that,"" said Hale. The ongoing government shutdown left more than 800,000 workers furloughed since Tuesday. Cruz promised Republican victory in shutdown fight . Hagel said Pentagon and Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys concluded that the law allows the DOD to eliminate furloughs for employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members. ""We immediately began working with the Department of Justice on how to implement it,"" said Hale, ""and the Department expressed the opinion that the law does not permit a blanket recall of all DOD civilians. The Department of Justice did say that we could undertake a careful review of civilians who support members of the armed forces and determine who to recall. Needless to say, this is a difficult process and a very time consuming one."" Hale said officials established a series of categories for civilians who will return to work and those who will not. The first group to return will be ""accepted civilians, the ones that are working right now connected to military operations and the safety of life and property."" Obama blames Boehner for ongoing shutdown . ""We will recall a category of civilians who provide ongoing support to military members on an ongoing basis like health care, family programs, training and maintenance and commissaries. We will also recall a second category of civilians whose work, if interrupted by a lapse for a substantial period, could cause future problems for military members. Falling in this category is acquisitions, program oversight, contract logistics, financial management, supply chain management,"" said Hale. The group that will not be recalled from furlough includes staff who are ""less directly related to military members,"" said Hale. Those that will not be recalled include some of the Information staff, some of the legislative and public affairs staff, the deputy chief management officer staff, auditors and staff working in non-DOD activities. House passes measure to bring military chaplains back to work . ""Because of the letter of the law and the advice from the DOJ we had to identify those with the less direct effect on military members,"" said Hale. Just hours before the announcement, the House passed a bill providing back pay to federal workers who were furloughed. It's unclear when the Senate might vote on the bill. On Friday, the White House said the president would sign such a measure. Speaker John Boehner and GOP House leadership held the vote as part of a strategy to pass piecemeal spending legislation that addresses the issues brought up by the shutdown. Although Democrats oppose the incremental approach, saying it amounts to conservatives choosing to fund programs and services they like, the bill passed with strong bipartisan support. Retroactive pay is provided under the bill, but federal workers can't expect paychecks until after the government shutdown ends and Congress reaches a resolution on the budget. Hagel's announcement guarantees that many of the Defense Department workers no longer have to wait on Congress in order to go back to work.

"She had a 1-year-old child inside and apparently was unarmed. Instead, the motorist's black Infiniti, according to authorities, itself became a weapon Thursday afternoon, first striking a security barrier and U.S. Secret Service officer near the White House before hurtling down some of the capital's most famous streets, police cruisers in pursuit. Dramatic video taken minutes later near the U.S. Capitol showed the vehicle backing into a police vehicle before the chase resumed. Gunshots rang through the traffic circle. The motorist was shot by police just a few blocks away. The woman died. The child was safe and in protective custody. Two officers were injured. Police vehicles were damaged. And a city heretofore fixated on a partial government shutdown was left with unanswered questions. Why did this happen? Why did the woman drive away from the White House and toward Capitol Hill? While U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said there appeared to be no evidence of terrorism, Metropolitan Police Department Chief Cathy Lanier said, ""This does not appear to be in any way an accident."" Officials, who called it an ""isolated incident,"" were tight-lipped about the suspect and did not name her at an evening briefing. The early hours of the investigation turned northward Thursday night. A task force prepared to execute a search warrant at the woman's Stamford, Connecticut, residence, law enforcement sources said. Police and bomb squad units surrounded an apartment complex. Authorities wanted to speak with the suspect's relatives in Brooklyn, New York, but were turned away, federal law enforcement sources told CNN. The chase created a chaotic scene of blaring sirens, locked-down lawmakers and bystanders hitting the dirt. House and Senate sessions were immediately suspended, with legislators ordered to take cover and keep away from windows. Police also closed Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. The chase began near the White House. A U.S. Secret Service source said when the woman drove up to a barrier at the 15th and E street checkpoint, she was approached by Secret Service officers who did not recognize her car. The motorist hurriedly tried to drive away, executed a three-point turn, struck the barrier and backed into an officer before driving away, the source told CNN. Police said the car sped down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol, where security vehicles stopped it at Garfield Circle. Frank Schwing, a Washington resident who was near the area, said officers ""came out with their guns drawn"" and approached the suspect's vehicle. ""At that point, the driver slammed into reverse, slammed into a cruiser, did a 180 (degree turn), took off,"" Schwing told CNN, adding, ""at that point, there were a half dozen or so shots fired,"" apparently all by small arms from police. Video footage by other witnesses showed the black vehicle then careening around a nearby traffic circle with a police car in close pursuit and then headed away. Shortly afterward, the car crashed into security barriers a few blocks away, witnesses said. Lanier said more shots were fired after the vehicle stopped, and the woman was hit several times. The driver was later pronounced dead, Lanier said. According to multiple sources, there was no reason so far to believe that the woman fired any shots or even had a weapon. Officers did not know a child was inside during the chase, officials said. Lanier, citing the lengthy pursuit, rammed vehicles and an attempt to breach two security perimeters, said the driver's actions did not appear to be accidental. Security perimeters at the White House and Capitol worked, Lanier told reporters. ""They did exactly what they were supposed to do,"" she said. A Capitol Police officer whose vehicle crashed during the chase also was hurt, authorities said. The officer was released from a local hospital Thursday night. The Secret Service did not release information about its injured agent. Authorities lauded the action of police -- some of whom aren't being paid -- who responded to the incident. Because of the government shutdown, U.S. Capitol Police aren't receiving a paycheck, although they will receive checks once appropriations are restored. In Congress, a Capitol Police bulletin said reports of gunshots required ""all occupants in all House office buildings to shelter in place."" ""Close, lock and stay away from external doors and windows,"" the bulletin said. Authorities later lifted the lockdown, with police saying they believed the incident was isolated. President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation, which occurred on the third day of a government shutdown due to a stalemate in Congress over government funding. ""The timing on this was really kind of scary,"" said Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas. ""Capitol Hill police are at a lower personnel level because of the shutdown.""","Investigation goes to New York City; Stamford, Connecticut .

"The ongoing violence in Syria has left millions of people displaced. And while many Syrians fled to neighboring countries to escape the bloodshed, others have remained despite being in harm's way, though they have been forced from their homes. According to the United Nations (U.N), an estimated 4.25 million people are homeless inside the country -- half of whom are believed to be children. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children have been left vulnerable after being forced to relocate from their homes, often multiple times. Without adequate shelter, food and medical care, many people are now heavily relying on aid agencies to provide basic amenities. The family of Ayesha (not her real name) is among them. Ayesha says she fled her hometown in northern Syria after a bomb destroyed her home, killing two of her teenage children. She now lives in an abandoned building site with her remaining children and grandchildren and she fears for her family's safety, which is why she has asked not to use her real name. Her four-year-old granddaughter carries a physical scar of the ongoing conflict -- after being burned during shelling. Recalling the days she lived in her own house and farmland, Ayesha says: ""You have five people being killed, at times six or 10 and 15. Every day they targeted us with bombs, missiles and snipers."" Prison inmates suffer the most in Syria . Ayesha is one among the 6.8 million people the U.N. deems to be in urgent need of protection and assistance. The destruction of homes and land has forced many others to abandon their old lives. Zenat (not her real name), a young mother, says she fled after her house was bombed.  Her four-year-old son suffers from burns from that day. ""He was burned while he was at the house, they bombed the house, which collapsed on him, and there is no available treatment for him,"" she says. Syria's medical system has suffered a heavy blow in this nearly three-year-old conflict.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 50% of Syrian hospitals have been destroyed or are non-operational. 7-year-old's story shows pain, worry of Syrian refugees . That means, for a mother like Zenat, immediate medical care is unavailable even in dire situations. ""We did not get any help, there are no doctors, where shall we take him? My heart burned where I saw him this way, it was very hard feeling for me,"" she recalls. According to data given to the WHO by Syrian health authorities, as of July 2013, 60% of the 91 public hospitals across the country have been affected by the conflict. Of those, 20 have been damaged, and 35 are out of service. Many Syrian doctors have also fled the country and for aid agencies trying to provide medical relief to the needy, Syria remains one of the most dangerous places to work. Some of the heavily damaged towns in Syria have even less access to healthcare. Syria's health ministry estimates that in the governorates of Deir-ez-Zo, Idleb and Aleppo, 70% of health centers are either damaged or out of service, the WHO said. World Food Programme beefing up its Syria program . Aid needed . The United Nations Security Council is trying to ensure aid reaches those suffering inside Syria -- calling on the government to allow cross-border deliveries and on all combatants to agree on humanitarian pauses in fighting for aid convoys. Regardless of the dangers of operating in the middle of a battlefield, several Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are trying to establish medical care, with some hospitals even operated secretly.  British-Syrian run charity Hand in Hand for Syria is one of them. It helps operates 37 clinics and hospitals within Syria, supported largely by donated medical supplies and volunteer doctors. In a makeshift clinic in Idleb province, Doctor Mohammed Abdul Salam, a pediatrician and medical director of a children's clinic run by the charity says: ""There were no incubators in areas outside the government's control for premature babies. ""In besieged areas, private hospitals used to charge high prices and people could not afford the costs of care, and that's why there was high infant mortality."" The U.N. body for assistance in Syria -- the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -- estimates that for 2013 alone aid of $1.4 billion is needed to deal with the growing humanitarian crisis inside the country. Destabilization of Syria's population will have an impact for many, many years to come. But for now, immediate assistance is needed for millions living under dire conditions.

"President Barack Obama in an exclusive interview with the Associated Press released Saturday laid responsibility for the government shutdown squarely at the feet of House Speaker John Boehner. ""We can vote to open the government today,"" Obama told the Associated Press in the wide-ranging interview. ""We know that there are enough members in the House of Representatives -- Democrats and Republicans -- who are prepared to vote to reopen the government today. The only thing that is keeping that from happening is Speaker Boehner has made a decision that he is going to hold out to see if he can get additional concessions from us."" Much of the government has been shut down -- more than 800,000 workers furloughed, national parks closed, programs for programs from child care to space exploration shuttered -- for five days. And it's likely to remain closed for several days if not weeks more, House Republicans concede. Despite public pressure to reach a resolution -- and statements from politicians that they want to -- Washington's political machinery has been gridlocked. And there's little indication there will be any breakthrough until at least mid-October, when the next economic crisis comes up over whether Congress will give the federal government the OK to increase how much it can borrow or default on its debt. Obama, in the AP interview, said he did not expect the latter to occur. ""There were at least some quotes yesterday that Speaker Boehner is willing to make sure that we don't default,"" he said in the interview, which was taped Friday. ""And just as is true with the government shutdown, there are enough votes in the House of Representatives to make sure that the government reopens today. ""And I'm pretty willing to bet that there are enough votes in the House of Representatives right now to make sure that the United States doesn't end up being a deadbeat. The only thing that's preventing that from happening is Speaker Boehner calling the vote."" Boehner, speaking to reporters Friday, tried to ratchet up pressure on Obama to end the crisis by acceding to his demand that he negotiate changes to Obamacare as part of any deal. Fuming about a Wall Street Journal report that cited an unidentified Obama administration official as saying ""We are winning,"" Boehner said, ""This isn't some damn game!"" Much of the opposition to the administration's efforts has been led by sympathizers of the tea party, who are seeking a reduction in the national debt and the federal budget deficit, as well as a reduction in U.S. government spending and taxes. Asked whether the tea party members are good or bad for the country, Obama told the AP he was more concerned about their tactics than about their positions. ""It's this idea that if they don't get 100% of their way, they'll shut down the government or they'll threaten economic chaos,"" he said. ""That has to stop."" Obamacare glitches . The government shutdown occurred when Obama refused to give in to Republican demands that he delay or change the Affordable Care Act, the signature achievement of his first term that began enrolling patients on October 1. Obama said he did not know how many people had signed up for the plan, also known as Obamacare. He acknowledged that computer glitches have snarled the process for some, but urged them not to give up. ""My message to them would be, each day the wait times are reduced,"" he said. But the program is not going to be affected by the budget negotiations, he said. ""The obsession with the Affordable Care Act, with Obamacare, has to stop,"" he added. ""That is not something that should be a price for keeping the government open."" Obama contrasted his own low-profile behavior during his single term in the Senate with that of some current first-term senators, who include Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky -- all of whom have been outspoken in their opposition to Obamacare. ""I didn't go around courting the media, and I certainly didn't go around trying to shut down the government,"" he said. ""And so I recognize that in today's media age, being controversial, taking controversial positions, rallying the most extreme parts of your base -- whether it's left or right -- is a lot of times the fastest way to get attention or raise money, but it's not good for government. It's not good for the people we're supposed to be serving."" Thoughts on Iran . The AP interview also touched on the question of Iran's nuclear program and the overtures made last month by President Hassan Rouhani at the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York. ""Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran's security and defense doctrine, and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions,"" Rouhani told the world body. Obama said the United States should test such overtures. ""I think Rouhani has staked his position on the idea that he can improve relations with the rest of the world,"" Obama said. ""And so far, he's been saying a lot of the right things. And the question now is, can he follow through?"" Obama said the U.S. view is that Iran is at least a year away from being able to produce a nuclear weapon, double the six months cited this week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has expressed deep distrust of Tehran's intentions -- calling Houssani ""a wolf in sheep's clothing."" ""What I've said to Prime Minister Netanyahu is that the entire point of us setting up sanctions and putting pressure on the Iranian economy was to bring them to the table in a serious way to see if we can resolve this issue diplomatically,"" Obama said. ""And we've got to test that. We're not going to take a bad deal. We are going to make sure that we verify any agreement that we might strike."" One more thing ... Though much of the interview focused on the sport of politics, it ended on the politics of sport. Asked about the Washington Redskins, a name some people consider to be insulting to Native Americans, the nation's first black president said he would be open to changing the name if he owned the team. ""I don't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real, legitimate concerns that people have about these things,"" he said. But Obama added that there was little chance he would wind up owning a football team. If he were to own any professional sports team after leaving the presidency, Obama said, it would more likely be a basketball team.","""We can vote to open the government today,"" Obama tells the AP .
The nation is in its fifth day of a federal shutdown .
But Obama does not expect the nation will default .

"Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan appealed for calm Thursday in his first public comments since he was freed after being abducted by militia gunmen for several hours. In remarks to a Cabinet meeting broadcast on Libyan state TV, Zeidan said he did not want to see the situation escalate and urged Libyans to show ""wisdom."" Zeidan's abduction from a luxury hotel early Thursday highlighted the security threat posed by militias that have run rampant in Libya since the revolution that ousted Moammar Gadhafi two years ago. ""These types of groups exploit these types of gaps that exist in the country at the moment, given the fact that we are in the process of building our criminal justice system,"" Libyan Foreign Minister Mohammed Abdelaziz told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. But the prime minister appeared to play down his kidnapping, characterizing it as an internal political problem. ""I want to reassure the foreigners inside Libya that this issue happened within the context of political Libyan disagreements and the foreigners are not being targeted,"" he said. Immediately after Zeidan's release, Nouri Abusahmain, president of the Libyan General National Congress, said the prime minister was ""in good shape"" and ""in good spirits"" as he headed to his office. His abduction prompted a slew of confusing reports. Gunmen move in before dawn . The gunmen took Zeidan before dawn from the Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli and put him into a convoy of waiting cars, according to a hotel clerk who was not authorized to speak to the media. The five-star hotel that Zeidan calls home is popular among government officials, some of whom reside there, including the justice minister. The witness reported no gunfire during the incident and said the gunmen were respectful and ""caused no trouble."" Zeidan's office initially called the abduction a ""rumor"" on its official Facebook page, but later posted an update that it was ""coerced by kidnappers to deny the report."" His spokesman told CNN that the prime minister was kidnapped. But the Operations Room of Libya's Revolutionaries, the militia that took him, said it merely detained him over financial and administrative corruption charges. However, the Justice Ministry said there was no arrest warrant for Zeidan, calling the move a kidnapping.  Abusahmain said the government was not aware of the charges and the prime minister was prepared to answer any questions. The militia works with the Interior Ministry -- a not altogether uncommon practice in Libya, which has tried unsuccessfully to rein in the many militia groups. Instead, various ministries have teamed up with them for their own needs, including providing security services. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, on a visit to Malaysia, said he had spoken with U.S. Ambassador to Libya Deborah Jones and Washington as the situation in Libya evolved, and would stay in close touch. ""Our embassy personnel are secure. We're confident about our abilities to keep them in that security,"" Kerry said. The situation underscores ""something that we've been really focused on in these last months, which is building capacity in Libya,"" he added. It has been just over a year since U.S. envoy Christopher Stevens was killed in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. British Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed Zeidan's release. ""We will work with Libyan government on ensuring the transition remains on track and insecurity is addressed,"" he tweeted. Libya questions U.S. ambassador over al Libi capture . Militias demand more autonomy . In the eastern part of the country, militias are demanding more autonomy from the central government and have severely constrained Libya's oil output, which is central to its export revenue. Last month, Zeidan said the nation is trying to rebuild after decades under Gadhafi's rule. He shot down reports that Libya is a failed state. ""We are trying to create a state, and we are not ashamed of that,"" he told CNN's Amanpour. ""The outside world believes that Libya is failing, but Libya was destroyed by Gadhafi for 42 years, and was destroyed by a full year of civil war. And that's why we are trying to rebuild it."" Part of Libya's rebuilding involves reconciliation and accountability, Zeidan said last month. Libya has an interim president, but the prime minister holds all executive powers. Security an issue . Armed militias have roamed the country largely unchecked since the 2011 ouster of Gadhafi. ""We are starting from scratch, and I think it will take time,"" said Abdelaziz, the foreign minister. ""As long as we have a sustained support on the part of the international community, I think Libya will make it."" Rights groups have said security remains a principal concern in Libya. ""The main problem affecting both justice and security is that armed militias still maintain the upper hand,"" Human Rights Watch said in a report last month. ""They have various agendas -- financial, territorial, political, religious -- and operate with impunity two years after the Gadhafi regime ended. Successive interim governments have failed to assert control over these militias, preferring to contract them as parallel forces to the army and police."" In a statement issued Thursday, the rights group said it was ""deeply troubled"" by Zeidan's detention, which it described as a clear violation of Libyan law. ""The incident highlights the grave security conditions in Libya today. Hopefully it will refocus attention on the urgent need to strengthen both the country's security forces and its judicial systems,"" it said. Recent attacks have added to the uncertainty in Libya. Gangs of armed men have surrounded key ministries, including the Justice Ministry, trying to force out members of the democratically elected government. Libyan Justice Minister Salah Marghani was forced to evacuate after armed militias surrounded his ministry in April. Libyan intelligence services have warned that the country is becoming a haven for al Qaeda to regroup and regenerate itself. Numerous weapons left over after Gadhafi's downfall are providing groups with different motivations to form their own militias, government officials said. U.S. operation . On Saturday, U.S. forces swooped into Tripoli and seized a Libyan national indicted in the 1998 American Embassy bombings in East Africa. Abu Anas al-Libi is a suspect in the embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania, and American officials have described him as ""one of the world's most wanted terrorists."" The militia group said the prime minister's capture had nothing to do with the arrest of al-Libi. However, three days ago, it issued a warning that whoever collaborated with ""foreign intelligence services"" in the arrest of the terror suspect would be punished. It's unclear if Zeidan played a role in the arrest of al-Libi by U.S. forces. But the Libyan government has decried the arrest of the terror suspect, and its national congress Tuesday demanded that the United States hand him over. The foreign minister, Abdelaziz, denied that Zeidan's abduction had anything to do with the American operation. ""I don't really see the relevance of this abduction to that what happened,"" he said, ""because the debate in relation to the disagreements between some of the military groups and the government officials -- it was there for some time.""","Militias are exploiting the gaps in security in Libya, the foreign minister says .

"The impact of Friday's shooting at Los Angeles International Airport is still being felt by the nation's air travelers. The Federal Aviation Administration announced it ordered a first-tier ground stop that ended at 3 p.m. PT (6 p.m. ET). The ground stop applied to LAX-bound flights that were departing from airports in the western United States; those aircraft were held at their departure airports, the FAA said in a statement. Nearly 750 flights were affected, with 46 flight diversions, according to Gina Marie Lindsey, executive director of Los Angeles World Airports. Flight tracking site Flightaware.com reported 104 departures canceled and 93 arrivals canceled out of the 1,114 flights that were scheduled to operate at LAX after 9:30 a.m. On Friday morning, at about 9:20 a.m. PT (12:20 p.m. ET) a gunman opened fire at a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint. One TSA officer was killed and two others were injured. The airport was in the process of letting employees back into Terminals 1 and 2 around 4 p.m. PT Friday, Lindsey, said. Terminal 3, where the incident occurred, will remain closed for the time being, Lindsey said. Passengers expecting to fly out of Terminal 3 should contact their airlines for more information, she said. Many travelers took the delays in stride.

"Talks between Iran and six world powers over Tehran's nuclear ambitions ended Wednesday on a promising note when they released a joint statement for the first time, suggesting Iranian officials appear willing to negotiate. The meeting in Geneva ended with a statement that described the talks as ""substantive and forward-looking."" The tone of the negotiations appeared to signal a shift, a departure from the diplomatic standoff that prevailed under former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The latest discussions centered on a proposal put forth by Iran, which wants the six powers to recognize what it says is the peaceful nature of its nuclear energy pursuits. Details, however, were scarce. ""We will be doing the negotiation in the negotiating room and not in the press,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told reporters after the talks concluded. Discussions were scheduled to resume November 7 and 8. According to Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, who is taking a lead role in the negotiations,  the sides could reach an agreement in as little as three to six months. ""The Iranian proposal was a new proposal with a level of seriousness and substance that we had not seen before,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. Differences remain. ""No one should expect a breakthrough overnight,"" Carney said. ""And these are complicated issues. They're technical issues. And as the President has said, the history of mistrust is very deep. ""The onus remains on Iran to come into compliance with its international obligations.  And any deal must prove to the international community that Iran's program will be used for exclusively peaceful purposes,"" he said. A senior U.S. administration official echoed Carney's cautious optimism. ""A positive outcome is not guaranteed,"" the official said, stressing at the same time that discussions were ""intense, detailed, straightforward"" and ""candid."" The two-day talks brought together Iran's representatives and those from the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain, all countries with permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who is leading the talks for the P5+1 bloc, called it a ""very intensive and very important meeting."" She also declined to offer specifics but said they were the most detailed to date. The joint statement built on a measured hope that was expressed after the first day of the talks. ""For the first time, we had very detailed technical discussions,"" a senior U.S. State Department official said. A spokesman for the EU's foreign policy chief called Iran's presentation ""very useful."" Zarif, who is leading the Iranian delegation, said in a Facebook post Wednesday that their proposal outlined ""a new view which emphasizes the need for pursuing a common goal by all players"" and identified areas that must be agreed upon. ""This framework was welcomed as a new approach by the heads of the delegations. Of course we would like to see a new approach by the 5+1, as well,"" he said. Opinion: Why there's room to strike a deal . 'Ball is in Iran's court' Many in the West fear Iran is pursuing the development of a nuclear bomb, but Iran -- slapped with sanctions because of its program -- has always maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only. Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann, said Tuesday that the mood was one of ""cautious optimism"" but that the ""ball is in Iran's court"" to respond to the bloc's concerns. The P5+1 bloc put forward its own proposals at a meeting with Iran in Kazakhstan in the spring, and these remain on the table, Mann told reporters. Critics have expressed suspicions about Iran's uranium enrichment, fearing that Iran may secretly be transforming nuclear fuel into atomic bomb-grade materials. On Monday, Iran's Araqchi said shipping Iran's enriched uranium out of the country was a ""red line."" But on Wednesday, he hinted at flexibility, saying that ""red lines need not be obstacles."" Iran insists the West must accept its right to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes as allowed under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which Iran is a signatory. Thawing relations? This week's high-level talks in Geneva are the first such talks since the election of President Hassan Rouhani this summer raised the prospect of a shift in direction from Iran. During a visit to the U.N. General Assembly in September, Rouhani's diplomatic approach raised hopes in the West of a thaw in relations with Tehran and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program. Rouhani's visit culminated in a phone call with U.S. President Barack Obama and a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iran's Zarif. Iran nuclear talks are key topic as Obama, Netanyahu meet . It was the first such high-level contact between the two sworn enemies since Iran's 1979 revolution, which sent relations between the two into a deep freeze. In another sign of easing tensions, Iran's state news agency IRNA reported Wednesday that Iran and Britain plan to introduce their nonresident charges d'affaires --  the level of diplomat below ambassador -- within two weeks. Tehran and London agreed to the step on October 8, after a telephone call between Zarif and his British counterpart, William Hague.  The diplomats' mission will be to improve relations on the way to the eventual reopening of embassies, Hague said then. Asked about Wednesday's IRNA report, Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office told CNN that an announcement would be made in due course. Britain closed its embassy in Iran and evacuated its entire diplomatic staff from that country in late 2011 after hundreds of student protesters stormed the embassy and another British diplomatic compound. Hague also ordered the Iranian Embassy in London to close immediately, saying that Iran was in breach of its international obligations to protect diplomatic missions. Israel warns against easing sanctions . As the latest talks in Geneva continue, Israel has warned against easing the punishing economic sanctions imposed against Iran too soon. Such a move would be a ""historic mistake,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday. ""Now is an opportune moment to reach a genuine diplomatic solution that peacefully ends Iran's military nuclear program,"" he said. ""This opportunity can only be realized if the international community continues to place pressure on Iran, because it is that pressure that has brought Iran back to the negotiations in the first place."" Not everyone is pleased with the talks. Alireza Jafarzadeh, with the opposition National Council of Resistance of Iran, accused Iran of using them to buy time to move forward with its nuclear weapons program. He called for still tighter sanctions. ""The P5+1 is allowing Iran to talk its way into a nuclear bomb; this explains the new atmospherics and smiles by the Iranian regime's officials,"" Jafarzadeh said. ""The ruling mullahs only understand the language of strength and decisiveness. More concessions will only result in more deceit by the Iranian regime."" Ali Larijani, Iran's powerful parliamentary speaker and a close associate of the nation's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said last week that Iran is serious about resolving the dispute over its nuclear program. It is keen to resolve the issue ""in a short period of time,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview from Geneva. ""From Iran's side, I can say that we are ready,"" he said.

"A new report claiming to be the most comprehensive look at global slavery says 30 million people are living as slaves around the world. The Global Slavery Index, published by the Australia-based Walk Free Foundation, lists India as the country with by far the most slaves, with an estimated nearly 14 million, followed by China (2.9 million) and Pakistan (2.1 million). The top 10 countries on its list of shame accounted for more than three quarters of the 29.8 million people living in slavery, with Nigeria, Ethiopia, Russia, Thailand, Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and Bangladesh completing the list. In terms of countries with the highest of proportion of slaves, Mauritania in West Africa topped the table, with about 4% of its 3.4 million people enslaved, followed by Haiti, Pakistan, India and Nepal. READ MORE: Mauritania -- slavery's last stronghold . The index, whose authors claim it contains the most authoritative data on slavery conditions worldwide, is the product of Australian mining magnate and philanthropist Andrew Forrest's commitment to stamp out global slavery. Forrest, ranked by Forbes as Australia's fifth richest man, with an estimated net worth of $5.7 billion, adopted the cause after his daughter volunteered in an orphanage in Nepal in 2008, where she encountered victims of child sex trafficking. Forrest is a signatory to the Giving Pledge started by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose members commit to donating at least half their wealth to philanthropic causes. The index, which draws on 10 years of research into slavery and was produced by a team of 4 authors supported by 22 other experts, is the inaugural edition of what will be an annual report. It ranks 162 countries according to the number of people living in slavery, the risk of enslavement and the robustness of government responses to the problem. Walk Free policy and research manager Gina Dafalia told CNN the report was intended to shine a spotlight on the issue, and quantify the extent of the problem in different countries before anti-slavery initiatives were launched. So far, she said, Walk Free, along with partners Humanity United and the Legatum Foundation, had pledged a total of $100 million to stamp out the practice. READ MORE: CNN's Freedom Project . ""When we started working in this area we realized that we didn't have a good understanding of what exactly the situation of slavery is in the world,"" she said. ""We needed that information before we started doing any interventions."" The index gives a higher estimate of the global number of slaves than other reports -- a report by the International Labor Organization last year pegged the number at 20.9 million. Dafalia said this was a result of the Global Slavery Index using a broader definition of slavery, which included human trafficking, forced labor, as well as practices such as forced marriage, debt bondage and the exploitation of children. ""Our definition of modern slavery includes, for example, forced and servile marriage, a concept not included in the ILO estimate, given the focus on 'forced labor,'"" she said. The explicit definition used in the report was ""the possession and control of a person in such a way as to significantly deprive that person of his or her individual liberty, with the intent of exploiting that person through their use, management, profit, transfer or disposal. Usually this exercise will be achieved through means such as violence or threats of violence, deception and/or coercion."" Kevin Bales, one of the report's authors and co-founder of Free the Slaves, said that the global number of slaves was difficult to quantify. But through methods including random sample surveys, researchers were able to arrive at an estimate. ""We were able to go to households and say 'Has anything like this happened to anyone in your family?'"" he said. He believed the index, which he hoped would provide ""a bit of a wake-up call"" to the world's governments, had a margin of error of between 5-10%. ""We always erred on the conservative side."" Asked why 30 million continued to live in conditions of slavery in 2013, Dafalia said the reasons varied from country to country, but one constant was that it remained a ""hidden problem."" READ MORE: No life for a child -- the grim reality of Nepal's child laborers . In some of the worst-hit countries, the report said, the affected parties were citizens ensnared in endemic, culturally-sanctioned forms of slavery -- ""the chattel slavery of the Haratins in Mauritania, the exploitation of children through the restavek practice in Haiti, the cultural and economic practices of both caste and debt bondage in India and Pakistan, and the exploitation of children through vidomegon in Benin."" In other examples, including Nepal, Gabon and Moldova, it was migrants who were most vulnerable to exploitation. In many examples, noted the report, child and forced marriage was prevalent and child protection practices weak. It noted that in India, the country with the most slaves, the risk of enslavement varied markedly from state to state. The Middle East and North Africa, it said, showed the highest measured level of discrimination against women, with one result being a high level of forced and child marriages within the region, and widespread exploitation of trafficked women as domestic workers and prostitutes. Vulnerable male migrants also frequently found themselves in exploitative working conditions. READ MORE: Modern day slavery in the Gulf . In contrast, said Bales, countries like Brazil led the world in anti-slavery efforts. ""It has a national plan to eradicate slavery. It has a dirty list where it has every company that's ever had slavery pollute their products, they have special anti-slavery police squads."" He rejected the suggestion that the term ""slavery"" was an overly emotive or misleading way of defining people who were trapped by crushing poverty. ""I spend a lot of time talking to people who have been or are in slavery, and when you talk to them about it, they know what the situation is,"" he said. ""We're not talking about bad choices, we're not talking about crummy jobs in a sweatshop. We're talking about real life slavery -- you can't walk away, you're controlled through violence, you're treated like property.""","A new report claims 30 million people are living as slaves globally .

"The man who smuggled a bomb in his underwear aboard a commercial airliner on Christmas Day in 2009 has been sentenced to life in prison, months after he pleaded guilty for his role in what officials later determined was an al Qaeda plot. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds imposed a life sentence Thursday on Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who entered the courtroom in Detroit wearing an oversized white T-shirt and a white skull cap.  His hands were unshackled once he entered. He argued a life sentence would be ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" as well as unconstitutional.  The judge rejected the argument. Prosecutors brought a video showing the detonation of a replica of the device AbdulMutallab attempted to use.  The judge ruled that the video could be shown during the sentencing hearing. In the sentencing report, prosecutors called now 25-year-old Nigerian ""an unrepentant would-be mass murderer, who views his crimes as divinely inspired and blessed."" AbdulMutallab previously pleaded not guilty to the eight charges against him, which include attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism. On December 25, 2009, passengers aboard a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam heard a loud noise on the plane as it descended toward Detroit.  Witnesses described it as sounding much like a firecracker. The device failed, but AbdulMutallab became enveloped in a fireball that spread to the wall and carpeting of the plane. Meet al Qaeda's chief bomb-maker . Four passengers quickly restrained him and helped put out the fire, witnesses said, and he was escorted up to the first-class section of the plane and taken into custody by authorities when it landed. AbdulMutallab later acknowledged in a courtroom statement that he had traveled to Yemen and was ""greatly inspired"" to participate in such a plot by U.S.-born militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in September. U.S. officials later said the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula had helped foment the failed attack. ""I carried with me an explosive device to avenge the killing of innocent Muslims,"" AbdulMutallab said in the statement, adding that the failed plot was in retaliation for ""U.S. tyranny and oppression of Muslims."" The flight was carrying 289 people. The decision to try AbdulMutallab in a civilian court prompted controversy at the time, particularly among Republican lawmakers pushing for a military tribunal.  He's been held at a Michigan federal prison since 2009. Prosecutors, however, said the case demonstrated the value of civilian courts. ""We should not limit ourselves to military tribunals,"" said U.S. District Attorney Barbara McQuade. The case shows ""the world that our system of justice works.""","Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab is sentenced to life in prison .

"Australian textbook rental startup Zookal will begin utilizing drones to make its deliveries in Australia next year, with ambitions of bringing the unique, unmanned delivery method to U.S. customers by 2015. The company says this marks the first commercial use of fully automated drones worldwide. It will fulfill deliveries in Sydney using six drones to start, dropping off textbook purchases at an outdoor location of the customer's choosing. To wipe away any potential privacy or surveillance fears, the drones aren't equipped with cameras. Instead, built-in anti-collision technology keeps them clear of trees, buildings, birds, and other potential obstacles. Both the location of the user and the drone's GPS coordinates are transmitted via a smartphone app, and Zookal claims deliveries can be completed in as little as two to three minutes once a drone takes flight. You can track the drone's progress from the app (which will only be available on Android at launch) and head outside once it's getting close. The drone never fully lowers itself to ground level, but rather hovers overhead and lowers its textbook delivery with the tap of a button on your smartphone. Watch: Flirtey Zookal flies . ""As one of the few countries in the world to allow commercial drone activities, Australia is uniquely placed to create a new drone industry and shape the development of regulations in this space,"" said Zookal CEO Ahmed Haider. Flirtey, the company that's providing the drones for Zookal's ambitious plan, is in the process of seeking regulatory approval with Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). A test flight is slated for November, and if all goes according to plan, proper commercial deliveries will begin in March. The FAA will need first need to outline a clear policy for commercial drone usage before such a system can make its way to the US, something it hopes to do in 2015.","Textbook supplier Zookal will start to use unmanned drones in Australia next year .

"Security forces in Libya are searching for heavily armed men who seized a truck carrying more than $50 million in cash in the city of Sirte, the state news agency LANA reported Tuesday. The group of 10 men intercepted the truck, which was carrying 53 million Libyan dinars (about $43 million) and another 12 million dinars (around $10 million) in euros and U.S. dollars Monday evening. The money shipment from the Central Bank of Libya was flown in from Tripoli and was on its way to the bank's Sirte branch when the truck was intercepted at an intersection near the airport by the group, which carried small and medium-size weapons. Bank officials told LANA the truck was escorted by only one security vehicle and the guards were not able to defend against the robbery. All commercial banks in the city were closed Tuesday in protest, LANA said. In July, masked gunmen made off with more than $400,000 from at least two banks in Sirte. The Libyan economy is primarily cash-only, and there has been concern about the rise in criminal activity across the country over the past year. In a statement Tuesday, the Sirte Local Council condemned the incident and called on residents to cooperate with security forces and provide any information they have that could help bring the perpetrators to justice. Sirte, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Tripoli, is the birthplace of former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and was his hiding place before his capture and killing in 2011. It was heavily damaged in the fighting in that year's civil war. Many residents complain about a lack of jobs, say they are neglected by the central government in Tripoli and are still demanding compensation for their damaged homes and losses from the revolution. The country's weak central government has been struggling to exert its authority over the hundreds of militias that operate freely two years after the fall of the Gadhafi regime. The deteriorating security situation and the growing power of militias were highlighted this month with Prime Minister Ali Zeidan's brief kidnapping by a militia in the capital. Another militia released Zeidan a few hours later. Violence in Benghazi . In the eastern city of Benghazi, which has been plagued by violence for more than a year, there has been a noticeable increase in bombings and shootings in recent weeks. At least two people were killed and five others wounded in a drive-by shooting that targeted a protest tent in central Benghazi on Monday evening, the state news agency said. The protest was by members of Gen. Abdel Fattah Younes' tribe. Younes, who was Gadhafi's interior minister until his defection in 2011, became the top rebel commander and was killed by a rebel faction under mysterious circumstances later that year. Members of his tribe and other supporters are still demanding those responsible be brought to justice. Car bomb blasts buildings in Benghazi . In another attack Tuesday morning, gunmen wounded a military officer in an assassination attempt outside his home in the al-Salmani district of Benghazi, LANA reported. The attack was the latest in an assassination campaign in the city that has primarily targeted security forces members, most of whom held positions in the former regime. Over the past 10 days, at least four senior security forces members, including the head of the country's military police, have been assassinated in the city. In a report released by Human Rights Watch in August, the watchdog reported the deaths of more than 50 people in what it said was a ""broadening wave of political assassinations"" focused mostly in the eastern cities of Derna and Benghazi. However, in its report, the rights group said the number of those killed ""is probably higher."" No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, and there has been public outrage in the city over what activists and residents say is a lack of accountability. So far, no one has been brought to justice in the escalating violence that many residents blame on Islamist militant groups operating in eastern Libya.

"(CNN) -- France's far-right National Front has won a nationwide election for the first time, as far-right parties across Europe caused a political ""earthquake,"" with a string of victories in voting for the European Parliament. The National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, notched up 24.95% of the vote in France, according to official estimates, well ahead of mainstream parties UMP and the Socialist Party. Le Pen said the win showed that people want to see change in Europe. France's Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the result was ""more than a warning. It is a shock, an earthquake."" Right-wing parties also gained ground in the UK, Denmark and Austria, according to projections posted on the European Parliament's official elections website. Voters across Europe have been casting ballots for days in the parliamentary vote. There are 751 seats from 28 countries up for grabs. With most of the ballots counted, provisional results indicate that left-center and right-center parties will still hold a majority of seats in the European Parliament, which plays a key role in shaping European laws and will weigh in on who the European Commission's next President should be. But right-wing parties and other so-called Euroskeptic groups who oppose the European Union are gaining ground, said Simon Usherwood, an expert on European politics at the University of Surrey. ""I think what's really changed is you're seeing a lot more groups on the edges, particularly with the far right, who are going to be much more of a feature of the next five years of the parliament,"" he said. So what does that mean? ""They don't have enough votes to stop legislation going through,"" Usherwood told CNN, ""but what they will get, particularly on the far right, is the time for speaking in debates, the chairmanship of certain committees, which means that they're going to have much more of a platform on which they can sell their message to voters."" In France, which has 74 seats in the European Parliament, the National Front won 24.95% of votes, according to official estimates, coming in ahead of the center-right UMP, which scored 20.8%, and President Francois Hollande's Socialist Party, which came in third with 14%. Even though the vote was for a regional legislative body, the potential impact on France's national political landscape was clear on Sunday. The results sparked stunned reactions from some French politicians and triumphant victory speeches from others. PM Valls described the election as ""a very serious moment for France and for Europe,"" noting that projections indicate that voters are skeptical of the European Union. ""None of us can shirk their responsibilities,"" he said, according to a summary of his remarks posted on the French government's website. Meanwhile, National Front leader Marine Le Pen said the results showed that French voters wanted more control. ""The sovereign people have proclaimed that they want to take back the reigns of their destiny into their hands. Our people demand one type of politics: politics of the French, for the French, with the French. They no longer want to be directed from outside,"" she said. She said the vote shows that President Francois Hollande should dissolve France's parliament, where most lawmakers come from mainstream political parties. Nearly 400 million Europeans were eligible to vote in the parliamentary elections. Turnout was just over 43%, slightly higher than it was during the last vote in 2009, Parliament spokesman Jaume Duch said. ""The clear message here is that people are unhappy with the way mainstream political parties have handled the economic crisis, and they're giving them a good kicking,"" said Petros Fassoulas, chairman of the pro-Europe European Movement. Before the election, analysts predicted that protest parties were likely to triumph at the polls. Those parties are demanding tighter border controls, nationalized decision-making and a dissolution of the currency union. But they have little in common aside from a dislike of the Brussels bureaucracy, so it's difficult for them to find much common ground, Usherwood said. ""They can agree they don't like the EU,"" Usherwood said, ""but they can't agree what they like and what the answer is."" CNN's Pierre Meilhan, Jim Bittermann, Ivana Kottasova, Jonathan Mann and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","NEW: Vote shows the French ""no longer want to be directed from the outside,"" Le Pen says .

"Italian coast guards rescued nearly 700 people in five separate operations overnight around the island of Lampedusa, they said Friday. News of the rescue operations came as European Union leaders were meeting in Brussels, Belgium, for a summit at which the issue of migration was high on the agenda. The deaths of more than 300 African migrants in a shipwreck off Lampedusa on October 3 shocked Italy and the world, and led to calls for EU lawmakers to review their migration policies. The European Council meeting was largely overshadowed by controversy over claims the United States has been spying on its European allies. Migrants appear undeterred, even after deadly shipwrecks . But in a statement of its conclusions, the EU leaders expressed ""deep sadness"" over the recent migrant deaths in the Mediterranean and pledged action to tackle the issue. ""Based on the imperative of prevention and protection and guided by the principle of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility, determined action should be taken in order to prevent the loss of lives at sea and to avoid that such human tragedies happen again,"" it said. The EU leaders said they would work with migrants' countries of origin and international organizations such as the U.N. refugee agency to try to address the root causes of migration. They also called for ""the fight against trafficking and smuggling of human beings to be stepped up"" in the European Union and countries that migrants originate from or pass through. The European Union is setting up a new border surveillance system and Mediterranean task force to bolster its efforts and will review its asylum immigration policies next summer, it said. Read more: Mediterranean 'becoming immigrants' cemetery' Because of its location as the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa is a frequent destination for African refugees seeking to enter European Union countries, and shipwrecks off its shores are common. But despite the dangers, migrants keep on coming. Within days of the October 3 sinking, another 34 people died when their boat capsized. Hundreds more have been rescued from often unseaworthy vessels. Many of the migrants are from African nations, while others have fled war-torn Syria, officials say. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres has called for an international process to consider refugees' medical needs and asylum requests and help them settle in Europe or elsewhere. The Italian coast guards said Friday they led the rescue of four boats with 219, 201, 95, and 91 people on board, and helped with a Maltese rescue of another vessel carrying 91 people -- a total of 697 people.

"Toronto's mayor says he will not resign despite a claim Thursday by the police chief that investigators recovered a video of the mayor that purportedly shows him smoking a crack pipe. The video was recovered from deleted files on a computer hard drive that was seized during a drug and gang investigation, according to a 465-page police report. Earlier this year, allegations surfaced in two media outlets that Rob Ford was recorded on video last winter using crack cocaine. Police Chief William Blair told reporters Thursday that a video was discovered in connection with the investigation but did not describe its contents. The video ""depicts images with what has previously been reported,"" Blair said. Mayor denies smoking crack, questions scandalous video's veracity . In May, the website Gawker and the Toronto Star newspaper published stories saying their reporters had seen 90 seconds of a cell-phone video showing the 44-year-old Ford, as the Star described it, ""inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe."" Later in the video -- as described by the Star -- an ""incoherent"" man both the Star and Gawker claimed to be Ford ranted about a number of subjects. The video, which has never been released publicly, shows a ""clearly impaired mayor,"" two reporters who say they saw the video wrote in the Star. Ford, who has repeatedly denied using crack cocaine, said he has no reason to resign. ""I wish I could come out and defend myself. Unfortunately, I can't because it's before the courts and that's all I can say right now,"" Ford told CNN partner CBC News. Ford has not been charged with anything. Toronto police had already been investigating drug and gang activity when reports first surfaced of an alleged video featuring the mayor smoking crack. In a police report ordered released to the public Thursday, Ford's name and image repeatedly popped up. The report detailed an investigation into drug, gang and criminal activity in Toronto. The lengthy police report, which includes hundreds of redacted pages, revealed that police sources believe the photo of Ford that first surfaced in May, along with the salacious report, is taken in front of a ""trap"" house used to ""chop"" crack. Police documents also detail evidence used to obtain a search warrant for a man suspected of drug trafficking, Alexander (Sandro) Lisi, who police also say is the mayor's friend as well as his driver. Lisi's attorney, Seth P. Weinstein, did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Photos collected by police show Ford and Lisi together on a number of occasions, including attending a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game, according to the documents. Lisi was arrested Thursday and charged with extortion, according to a police statement. Lisi is accused of using extortion to retrieve a recording, it said. Details about the recording were not publicly released. But Blair, the police chief, said a digital video in police custody will be shown in court in an effort to support the charge against Lisi. Lisi appeared in court Friday for a bail hearing and was released, Weinstein said. Addicts shoot up in safe haven in Canada .","Toronto police have a video of Mayor Rob Ford apparently using drugs .

"It appears fewer than 50,000 people successfully signed up for health coverage through the federally run Obamacare website during the first five weeks of open enrollment, falling well short of expectations for the period, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The federal online application process has been marked so far by serious technical problems with HealthCare.gov since its October 1 launch. The website was established as the main source of public information and the primary way for consumers to purchase private insurance online under the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. The Obama administration is scrambling to fix the problems and says website use is improving daily. It hopes to have the site running smoothly for most people by the end of the month. Some states are running their own enrollment programs for Obamacare and are faring better. The online enrollment debacle combined with some people losing their health insurance because of Obamacare have energized Republicans, who have hammered the President politically and see the rocky start as a potent campaign issue heading into next year's congressional midterm elections. Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Health and Human Services Department, declined to discuss enrollment specifics in responding to the Journal report, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the matter. ""We cannot confirm these numbers,"" Peters said. ""More generally, we have always anticipated that initial enrollment numbers would be low and increase over time, just as was the experience in Massachusetts, where only 0.3 percent, or 123 people paying premiums, enrolled in the first month,"" she said of a similar program set up in the Bay State. ""And, as we have said, the problems with the website will cause the numbers to be lower than initially anticipated,"" Peters said. The administration has said it will release official data later this week. A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to CNN, said the numbers reported by the Journal were not official and that final official data for the first month of open enrollment is not ready yet. The Journal's figure is pegged to ""834 transmissions"" received by insurance companies to complete enrollments. It reported private health plans had received federal enrollment information for 40,000 to 50,000 users. Marilyn Tavenner, the official charged with implementing Obamacare as director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told congressional lawmakers last week the administration had hoped to enroll 800,000 on the insurance exchanges by the end of November. That figure would presumably include both the exchanges run by the federal government and those run independently in 14 states and the District of Columbia. It is not clear if it also included enrollments for a large expansion of Medicaid meant to provide insurance to more low-income Americans.

At least 344,808 people have signed up online for coverage through Obamacare's state-run insurance marketplace but have not yet technically completed the enrollment process.

"(CNN)It's amazing what (literal) lengths some people will go to earn frequent flier miles. Take Ben Schlappig. Over his lifetime, he's accrued about four million miles. Half of those, he estimates, were earned on ""mile runs"" -- trips taken for the sole purpose of earning points. Recently, he completed a dizzying, non-stop trip (London-New York-Los Angeles-Honolulu-Los Angeles-London-Miami-London-Los Angeles-London) that would set most people's heads spinning. It took four days (three of which were spent almost completely on a plane), and he accrued 270,000 miles. He admits that the journey was exhausting, but ultimately worth it. ""To put it into some kind of perspective, it's enough miles for two first-class tickets between the U.S. and Asia,"" he notes. ""If I would have paid cash for them, they would have each cost me over $20,000."" December -- which marks the last opportunity for many frequent fliers to earn enough to gain (or maintain) their elite statuses -- is mile-run season. In the past, the trick was looking for a cheap ticket that went the distance, as miles earned were calculated by, well, miles flown. This year, that is all set to change. ""In 33 years of frequent flier programs, this is the year of the biggest changes ever,"" says Randy Petersen, founder of the online travel forum FlyerTalk and CEO of Frequent Flyer Services, which offers guidance to road warriors the world over. ""Some of the world's largest frequent flier programs are going to a revenue model,"" he explains, noting that come this year, many programs will start awarding members based on how much they spend, not how far they fly. Air New Zealand started the trend when it introduced Airpoint Dollars in 2004. Other airlines have followed suit over the years, such as Virgin Australia, JetBlue and Southwest (the latter -- which awards members 10 points for every dollar spent -- has one of the most popular frequent flier programs in the U.S.). Starting this month, both Delta and United shifted to a completely revenue-based system of calculating miles earned. Petersen predicts it's only a matter of time before the European carriers follow suit. ""They may say they won't, because they don't want to upset things, but these (carriers) are part of alliances. Over the next two years, I think you'll start to see revenue-based frequent flier programs tremble out through the rest of the airline industry."" Petersen notes there's also been a shift in hotel awards programs. ""A lot of hotel programs are changing what it costs per night come January. If you're planning on redeeming hotel rooms later this year, do it now. Get the redemptions at lower prices,"" he advises. As for points earned and spent on plane tickets, there's little to be done but to accept airlines' change in policy. ""It's too late for you to do anything. But here's what you don't do. Do not buy a more expensive ticket to earn miles. You'd be playing into what the airlines want. It's okay to earn fewer miles on a cheap ticket, because you'll still be able to find cheap awards out there,"" he says.

"Leaders of a shaky new government in Ukraine were mobilizing troops Sunday amid signs of Russian military intervention in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. The Ukrainian National Security Council ordered the mobilization as Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to dismiss warnings from world leaders to avoid military intervention in Crimea, a senior Ukrainian official, Andriy Parubiy, said. The news came as evidence mounted that pro-Russian forces were already in Crimea, an autonomous region of eastern Ukraine with strong loyalty to neighboring Russia. A sense of escalating crisis swirled Saturday night, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry condemning what he called ""the Russian Federation's invasion and occupation of Ukrainian territory"" despite a statement by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev that no decision had been made on whether Moscow would dispatch forces. Russia has not confirmed it deployed thousands of troops to the region following reports that armed, Russian-speaking forces wearing military uniforms -- without insignia -- patrolled key infrastructure sites. It was the latest in fast-moving developments that saw Russia's Parliament sign off on Putin's request to send military forces into Ukraine, raising the stakes in the escalating game of brinksmanship. Putin cited in his request a threat posed to the lives of Russian citizens and military personnel based in southern Crimea. Ukrainian officials have vehemently denied Putin's claim. CNN crews in and around Crimea's regional capital of Simferopol, meanwhile, have not seen evidence of a Ukrainian military presence. Putin's move prompted world diplomats to call for a de-escalation of tensions that have put the two neighbors on a possible path to war and roiled relations between Russia and the United States. In what appeared to be an illustration of the growing schism between the two world powers, U.S. President Barack Obama and Putin spoke for 90 minutes -- with each expressing their concern over the mounting crisis, according to separate statements released by their respective governments. According to the Kremlin, Putin told Obama that Russia reserves the right to defend its interests in the Crimea region and the Russian-speaking people who live there. ""President Obama made clear that Russia's continued violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would negatively impact Russia's standing in the international community,"" according to a statement released by the White House. Lean to the West, or to Russia? Ukraine, a nation of 45 million people sandwiched between Europe and Russia's southwestern border, has been plunged into chaos since the ouster a week ago of President Viktor Yanukovych following bloody street protests that left dozens dead and hundreds wounded. Ukraine has faced a deepening schism, with those in the west generally supporting the interim government and its European Union tilt, while many in the east preferring a Ukraine where Russia casts a long shadow. Nowhere is that feeling more intense than in Crimea, the last big bastion of opposition to the new political leadership. Ukraine suspects Russia of fomenting tension in the autonomous region that might escalate into a bid for separation by its Russian majority. Ukraine acting President Oleksandr Turchynov took to the airwaves late Saturday to warn that any Russian military intervention would lead to war. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said his country was ready to mobilize its forces to protect strategic locations, including nuclear power plants. 'The troops are already there' The crisis raised alarm bells with the worlds diplomats, with Ukrainian ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev calling on member nations of the U.N. Security Council to take a stand against what he called Russia's ""clear act of aggression.'' ""... The troops are already there, and their number is increasing every hour,"" Sergeyev said during an emergency meeting of the Security Council. Russia now has 15,000 troops in Ukraine's Crimea region, Yegor Pyvovarov, the spokesman for the Ukraine mission at the United Nations, told CNN ahead of Saturday's session of the Security Council. He did not say how Ukraine arrived at that number, or whether that included troops already stationed at a Russian base in the region. Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, rejected Ukraine's calls to stop Russian intervention. ""We can't  agree with this at all,"" he said. He blamed members of the European Union for causing the bloody street demonstrations in Ukraine. ""It's a difficult situation in the past few hours,"" Churkin said, claiming that there were Ukrainian forces from Kiev en route to to overthrow the local pro-Russian governments in eastern Ukraine and Crimea and establish new ones that would enforce the power of the new Ukrainian government. Churkin has said reports of Russian troops taking charge of positions on the ground were rumors and noted that rumors ""are always not true."" Crimea's pro-Russian leader asked for help . The Russian Parliament vote Saturday came on the day that the newly installed pro-Russian leader of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, asked Putin for help in maintaining peace on the Black Sea peninsula -- where Russia's  fleet is based at Sevastopol. Security forces ""are unable to efficiently control the situation in the republic,"" he said in comments broadcast on Russian state channel Russia 24. Aksyonov was installed as the region's premier after armed men took over the Crimean Parliament building on Thursday. Aksyonov said  that a referendum on greater Crimean autonomy, originally set for May 25, would be moved to March 30. Yatsenyuk called the Russian presence in Crimea a provocation. ""Ukraine will not be provoked, we will not use force. We demand that the government of the Russian Federation immediately withdraw its troops and return to their home bases,"" he said during a televised Cabinet meeting. Meanwhile, Ukraine Defense Minister Igor Tenyukh said his nation's military was at its highest state of military readiness. He credited negotiations during the day between the Ukrainian and Russian naval chiefs with easing tensions and said more negotiations were planned for Sunday. Airspace in the region reopened Saturday, a day after Ukraine accused Russian Black Sea forces of trying to seize two airports in Crimea but said Ukrainian security forces had prevented them from taking control. Groups of armed men, dressed in uniforms without identifying insignia, patrolled the airports in Simferopol and the nearby port city of Sevastopol. The men remained at the airports Saturday, but Yevgey Plaksin, director of the airport in Simferopol, said airport services were working. Obama: Warning to Russia . Meanwhile, Obama's message to Russia also reached Congress, where the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee called for an immediate response to Russia's move. ""Every moment that the United States and our allies fail to respond sends the signal to President Putin that he can be even more ambitious and aggressive in his military intervention in Ukraine,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said in a statement. He called on Obama to ""make clear what costs Russia will face for its aggression and to impose those consequences without further delay."" Senior White House officials say they are looking at a wide range of possible economic and diplomatic measures to present to Obama that would show Putin there is a cost to his actions in Ukraine. The White House has already announced the United States will suspend participation in preparatory meetings for the G-8 Summit that will bring world leaders together in June in Sochi, Russia. ""Going forward, Russia's continued violation of international law will lead to greater political and economic isolation,"" according to a statement released by the administration. Pressure was mounting on Russia as leaders from the EU and the UK joined an international outcry, with EU High Representative Catherine Ashton deploring Russia's ""unwarranted escalation of tensions."" During a telephone call with Putin, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said he told the Russian leader that it was crucial to ""restore calm and proceed to an immediate de-escalation of the situation."" ""Cool heads must prevail and dialogue must be the only tool in ending this crisis,"" he said.","Ukraine is mobilizing troops around the country, official says .

"(CNN)Throwing your keys at the parking valet as you sashay onto a flight may seem like the stuff of James Bond films, but already a robotic valet is taking the sweat out of getting on a plane at Germany's Dusseldorf airport. Rather than getting behind the wheel, however, this robotic valet physically lifts your three tons of road machinery and slots it into pre-designated robot parking bays. Nicknamed RAY by its creators, the automated forklift truck is the brainchild of Germany's Serva Transport. Aimed at business travelers in a hurry, the automated parking system can be controlled and booked via an app. All travelers have to do is drop the car off in a designated area, go to a nearby touch screen to confirm the car is empty, and RAY does the rest. RAY uses sensors to measure and photograph the car, it then gently lifts it and takes it to one of 249 parking spots reserved for the robot forklifts. The company claims that its space-saving system -- which uses lasers and sensors to measure not just the height and width of the cars but accessories such as wing mirrors and fenders -- can park 60% more cars than a human driver. The system is also connected to the airport's flight data system: RAY will retrieve the car based on flight itineraries. The app also lets car owners communicate with RAY if there are any flight delays. The airport charges €29 a day ($40) or €4 ($5.50) an hour for the service, which the airport's management said was likely to appeal to time-strapped corporates. ""Our product is especially appealing to business travelers, who arrive at the airport shortly before the flight, seek efficient parking, and return within a few days,"" Thomas Schnalke, the airport's managing director, said in a statement. A new tie-up with Volkswagen announced this month aims to increase the efficiency of RAY by getting the car and the parking robot to communicate with each other. ""Our jointly developed technology exchanges data automatically between RAY and Volkswagen cars via Bluetooth and thus facilitates the parking progress,"" said Rupert Kock, the managing director at Serva Transport Systems. But RAY is not the only robot valet on the block. A New Jersey startup called Boomerang also aims to take parking to the next level by using an automated parking system that can park hundreds of cars without human intervention. Shuffling them like the squares in a giant Rubik's Cube in garages that need no light and little ventilation, the company says the system not only saves on energy but can fit more cars into a smaller space, freeing up valuable land for other real estate. According to Boomerang CEO Mark Patterson the advantage of his system is that it is designed with multiple entry bays, multiple robots and multiple lifts so there is no single point of failure. ""If any one thing goes down, we can still operate the system,"" he told CNN. Drivers put their car into a parking bay that places the car on a large steel tray. Robotic wheeled platforms slide under the vehicle and then transport it to the bays following buried wires in the floor of the carpark. Patterson says its increased throughput means the bays can be filled and emptied more quickly than conventional carparks. ""Our system is installed in a garage with level concrete floors so there's total fire separation between floors like in a conventional garage - most legacy systems are steel rack structures with no separation between floors,"" he said. ""Developers like it because you can park 100% more cars in the same space and that's a big value proposition."" The other advantage is that the carpark is a 'sterile' environment that has no need for human intervention. ""The cars are not running in these garages so there's a big savings on air handling equipment,"" Patterson said. ""You need seven or eight air changes an hour with traditional carparks versus just one or two with this system."" Similarly, there's also no need to illuminate the building to the sort of levels that would deter muggers or other attackers that lurk in the gloom of multi-story carparks.

"Days after two French journalists were killed in northern Mali, authorities rounded up dozens of suspects and a group linked to al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the deaths. At least 30 suspects were seized in desert camps near the town of Kidal and taken to the local French army base for questioning, three officials in Mali said. The officials did not want to be named because they are not authorized to talk to the media. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has allegedly claimed responsibility for the killings, according to Sahara Media news agency in Mauritania. AQIM operates in northern Africa and the group's statements have shown up before on the Sahara outlet. Radio France International journalists Ghislaine Dupont and Claude Verlon were abducted in front of the home of a member of the Tuareg rebels' National Movement of a Liberation of Azawad on Saturday, RFI reported. They were found dead the same day. Their bodies arrived in Paris on Tuesday.

"(CNN)Three photos, two men, one mystery: Who kept Boston's historic landmark free of snow during one of the city's worst storms? More than two feet of snow covered the streets and sidewalks, shutting down Boston's schools, businesses and roadways this week. Although streets were plowed, snowfall obscured the iconic Boston Marathon finish line on Boylston Street. One of the first photos to surface shows a man in dark clothing approaching the street with a shovel. Philip Hillman, 44, took the photo and told CNN he was working out of a hotel room in downtown Boston on Tuesday afternoon because he didn't want to commute during the snowstorm, and happened to notice something strange outside his window. Hillman said seeing someone taking the time to clear off the finish line was something that made him proud to be a Bostonian. ""In my heart of hearts, I thought: Boston Strong  I love this city, and love that someone would do that."" After the mystery man was identified as Chris Laudani, a Boston bartender, people began calling him an American hero. ""It's very special to me and to the city, and I didn't think it deserved to be covered under all that snow,"" Laudani told CNN affiliate WCVB. This good deed shows how brightly the #BostonStrong spirit still shines, Hillman said, almost two years after the Boston Marathon attack. The second photo shows a man with his back to the camera, working to clear a section of the mostly covered finish line. The photographer, Kelsey Karkos, posted on Instagram that she was searching for the finish line when a man shoveling the sidewalk offered to clear the section of street. ""I do not know the man shoveling,"" she wrote. ""He saw me looking for the finish line while he was shoveling the sidewalk. He knew exactly what I was looking for and came over to help me! Such a great person with some boston spirit during the blizzard! I wish I knew his name!"" A third photo shows a person posing at a cleared off finish line with the caption, ""Shoveled off the finish line."" Instagram user @johnbackbay later tweeted to a reporter that he did not have any part in clearing the finish line. A Twitter campaign #WhoShoveledTheFinishLine quickly caught on. A Boston Police Department tweet and Facebook post asking for information about the mystery shoveler quickly went viral. Boston Officer Rachel McGuire told CNN that she was calling Laugani a ""chivalrous shoveler,"" and randomly came across the photo of him shoveling while browsing Twitter.

"The New York Times magazine is running a bombshell story alleging that the Pakistanis knew all along that Osama bin Laden was living for years in his longtime hiding place in the northern Pakistan city of Abbottabad, where he was killed by a U.S. Navy SEAL team on May 2, 2011. The Times story, titled ""What Pakistan Knew About bin Laden,"" will carry weight: It was written by Carlotta Gall, the dean of the correspondents who have covered Afghanistan and Pakistan since that fateful day in 2001, when al Qaeda's four hijacked planes crashed through America's comfortable sense that vast oceans insulated it from its enemies. At great personal risk Gall has authoritatively covered the war in Afghanistan for the past 12 years. Indeed, I first met her during the civil war in Afghanistan during the mid-1990s when she was an aid worker, and I have met her many times since. I encouraged her (along with, I'm sure, many others) to write a book about her reporting in Afghanistan, as no Western reporter has more to say about what has transpired there since the fall of the Taliban. The bin Laden story in the New York Times magazine is an extract from Gall's forthcoming book, ""The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014."" Gall makes two astonishing claims in her Times magazine piece. The first claim: An unnamed Pakistani official told her, based on what he had in turn heard from an unnamed senior U.S. official that ""the United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad."" ISI is Pakistan's powerful military intelligence agency. The second claim: ""The ISI actually ran a special desk assigned to handle bin Laden. It was operated independently, led by an officer who made his own decisions and did not report to a superior. He handled only one person: bin Laden...the top military bosses knew about it, I was told."" It is, of course, hard to prove negatives, but having spent around a year reporting intensively on the hunt for al Qaeda's leader for my 2012 book ""Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden From 9/11 to Abbottabad,"" I am convinced that there is no evidence that anyone in the Pakistani government, military or intelligence agencies knowingly sheltered bin Laden. How did I arrive at this conclusion? On three reporting trips to Pakistan I spoke to senior officials in Pakistan's military and intelligence service. They all denied that they had secretly harbored bin Laden. OK, you are thinking: ""But they would say that, wouldn't they?"" Well, what about the dozens of officials I spoke to in the U.S. intelligence community, Pentagon, State Department and the White House who also told me versions of ""the Pakistanis had no idea that bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad""? During the course of reporting for my book I spoke on the record to, among others, John Brennan, now the CIA director and then President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser; then CIA Director Leon Panetta and his chief of staff, Jeremy Bash; then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Adm. Mike Mullen; then Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. James Cartwright; then director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Michael Leiter; then senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council, Nick Rasmussen; then head of policy at the Pentagon, Michele Flournoy; Michael Vickers, who was then the civilian overseer of Special Operations at the Pentagon; Tony Blinken, who is now the deputy national security adviser; and Denis McDonough, who held that position before Blinken. These officials have collectively spent many decades working to destroy al Qaeda, and many are deeply suspicious of Pakistan for its continuing support for elements of the Taliban. But all of them told me in one form or another that Pakistani officials had no clue that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad. Indeed, an early debate between senior national security officials at the White House, once CIA intelligence established that bin Laden could be hiding in Abbottabad, was whether to mount a joint U.S.-Pakistani raid on bin Laden's suspected hideout. This plan was rejected because the officials were concerned that such a joint operation carried the risk that word would leak out about the bin Laden intelligence. This debate would have been moot if the Pakistanis already knew bin Laden was living in Abbottabad. And, by the way, if the U.S. government had any evidence that the Pakistanis were knowingly sheltering bin Laden, as Gall claims, why cover this up? In 2011, the relationship between the United States and Pakistan was at its lowest point ever. Early that year a CIA contractor killed two Pakistanis in broad daylight in the city of Lahore, and both countries were trading accusations about each other's perfidy. The tension was compounded by the fact that the CIA drone program in Pakistan was then at its height, which was deeply unpopular among Pakistanis. What did U.S. officials have to lose by saying that bin Laden was being protected by the Pakistanis if it were true? The fact is that the senior Pakistani officials Gall alleges were harboring bin Laden were utterly surprised that al Qaeda's leader was living in Abbottabad. Based on the bewildered reactions of top Pakistani officials to the events on the night that bin Laden was killed, it was obvious to U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter and to U.S. officials monitoring communications in Pakistan that the Pakistanis had not had a clue about bin Laden's presence there. Finally, in the course of reporting my book I discovered that bin Laden was even hiding from some of the people living in his own compound; forget about letting officials in the Pakistani government in on the secret.  One of the wives of the bodyguards protecting bin Laden didn't know that the tall stranger hiding on the compound was al Qaeda's leader. In fairness to Gall, I have heard from four current and former U.S. intelligence and military officials that some of the thousands of documents that U.S. Navy SEALs picked up at bin Laden's Abbottabad compound that haven't been publicly released could point to some kind of official Pakistani collusion. If that is the case, the Obama White House should release any documents that are relevant so that the American public can be the judge if one of our allies was knowingly harboring bin Laden all along. So far there is no evidence that that is the case.","Peter Bergen: NYT article says Pakistan knew bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad .

"On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant's reactor No. 4 blew up after a cooling capability test, and the resulting nuclear fire lasted 10 days, spewing 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. To date, it's the world's worst nuclear accident. The 2011 Fukushima meltdown, of course, is still playing out -- but actually, so is Chernobyl. Nearly 28 years after the disaster, Reactor No. 4 simmers under its ""sarcophagus,"" a concrete and metal cover hastily built after the accident. It's now cracked, rusted and leaking radiation. A partial roof collapse last February sent reverberations of fear throughout the world. As well it should have. With 200 tons of lava-like radioactive material still below the reactor, and the  ""New Safe Confinement"" aimed at containing and protecting it not scheduled for completion till 2015 (already 15 years overdue) this story of nuclear disaster is in its early chapters. Today, Chernobyl's soil, water, and air are among the most highly contaminated on Earth. The reactor sits at the center of a 1,000-square-mile ""Exclusion Zone,"" a quarantined no-man's land complete with border guards, passport control and radiation monitoring. Inside the Zone are hundreds of unmarked (and un-mapped) burial sites where machinery from the cleanup after the 1986 accident was dumped.  These days, Ukraine's four other nuclear power plants also dispose of their spent fuel inside the Zone. It's real, and it's scary. TED.com: The deadly genius of drug cartels . But amidst the complicated real-life calculations and compromises -- where science and politics meet to duke out the viability of nuclear energy -- the long, deep, human parable of Chernobyl is often lost. That story is partly embodied in an unlikely community of some 130 people, called ""self-settlers"" who, today, live inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Almost all of them are women, the men having died off due to overuse of alcohol and cigarettes, if not the effects of elevated radiation.  About 116,000 people were evacuated from the Zone at the time of the accident.  Some 1,200 of them did not accept that fate. Of that group, the remaining women, now in their 70s and 80s, are the last survivors of a group that defied authorities -- and it would seem, common sense -- and illegally returned to their ancestral homes shortly after the accident. I've been filming and interviewing this unlikely community since 2010. The Zone's scattered ghost villages are silent and bucolic, eerie and contaminated.  Many villages were bulldozed after the accident, others remain -- silent vestiges to the tragedy, and home to the ubiquitous wild boar. Still, other villages have 1 or 2 or 8 or 12 babushkas, or babas -- the Russian and Ukrainian words for ""grandmother"" -- living in them. One self-settler, Hanna Zavorotnya, told me how she snuck through the bushes back to her village in the summer of 1986. ""Shoot us and dig the grave,"" she told the soldiers who nabbed her and other family members, ""otherwise we're staying."" Then she handed me a chunk of warm salo --- raw fat -- from her just-slaughtered pig. TED.com: What I discovered in New York City's trash . Why would they choose to live on deadly land? Are they unaware of the risks, or crazy enough to ignore them, or both? It's hard for us -- especially Westerners with deeper connections to our laptops than any piece of soil -- to understand. But these women see their lives in a decidedly different way. When I asked Hanna about radiation, she replied: ""Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does."" It's all about context. They lived through Stalin's Holodomor -- the genocide-by famine of the 1930s that wiped out millions of Ukrainians -- and then the Nazis in the1940s. Some of the women were shipped to Germany as forced labor. When the Chernobyl accident happened a few decades into Soviet rule, they were simply unwilling to flee an enemy that was invisible. So long as they were well beyond child bearing, self-settlers were allowed to stay ""semi-illegally."" Five happy years, the settlers logic went, is better than 15 condemned to a high-rise on the outskirts of Kyiv. The residents of the Chernobyl region are forest-dwelling steppe people of Ukraine's Polesia region and did not adapt well to urban environments. There is a simple defiance common among them: ""They told us our legs would hurt, and they do,"" one 80-year-old woman told me. ""So what."" TED.com: Why our universe might exist on a knife edge . What about their health? There are benefits of hardy living from the land -- but also complications from an environment laced with radioactive contaminants, such as cesium, strontium and americium. Health studies vary. The World Health Organization predicts more than 4,000 deaths will eventually be linked to Chernobyl. Greenpeace and others put that projection into the tens of thousands. All agree thyroid cancers are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees have suffered the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere, including anxiety, depression, . Radioactive contamination from the accident has been death-dealing, to be sure, but relocation trauma is another, less-examined fallout of Chernobyl.  Of the old people who relocated, one Chernobyl medical technician, whose job is to give annual radiation exposure tests to zone workers  said: ""Quite simply, they die of anguish."" Home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka, and connection to the land is palpable.  They told me: ""If you leave you die,"" ""Those who left are worse off now. They are all dying of sadness,"" ""Motherland is Motherland. I will never leave."" TED.com: Architecture at home in its community . Curiously, what sounds like faith may actually be fact.  There aren't studies to refer to (after all, semi-legal marginalized old women living on radioactive land are hardly a civic or research priority) but  surprisingly  these women who returned home have, according to local officials and journalists who have kept track of them, seem to have outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation -- by some estimates, up to 10 years. How could this be? Certainly, their exposure at an older age put them at smaller risk.  (Young animals -- and I'm including humans here -- are more severely affected by radiation.)  But let's consider a less tangible though equally powerful idea. Does happiness affect longevity? Is the power of motherland, so fundamental to that part of the world, palliative?  Are home and community forces that can rival even radiation? I believe so. And unfailingly, so do the babushkas of the Zone. Radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives. But their existence and spirit will leave us wondering about the relative nature of risk, about transformative connections to home, and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self-determination.  They are unexpected lessons from a nuclear tragedy.","Holly Morris:1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident world'' worst. Area still highly contaminated .

"(CNN) -- For most of us, watching a fly mindlessly bouncing against a window in an effort to escape, is pretty annoying -- perhaps even infuriating. For a team of Swiss scientists, this stubborn maneuver could change the face of search-and-rescue missions forever. Introducing GimBall -- a spherical flying robot encased in a flexible cage, which allows it to happily smash into surfaces while navigating disaster sites. Bounce back . Unlike other rescue robots, where colliding with obstacles could easily spell the end of an expedition, GimBall is able to bounce back without losing its bearings or damaging its in-built camera. The futuristic floating ball is the brainchild of scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), and it's hoped that one day it will be used for everything from searching for survivors to measuring gas leaks in collapsed buildings. Watch: Flying robots perform amazing acrobatics . ""We were wondering why insects were so capable of going inside any building -- yet had limited senses such as eyesight,"" explained co-creator Adrien Briod. ""One capability that was completely overlooked was their ability to collide into surfaces. For insects this isn't a big deal -- but it is for robots."" Flying to the rescue . Indeed, one of the first major search-and-rescue missions to use robots was in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on New York's Twin Towers -- an area deemed too dangerous or inaccessible to humans. However, the ground-dwelling machines sometimes found it difficult to negotiate the collapsed World Trade Center, becoming stuck in the rubble. In the last decade, robotics has come a long way, with scientists increasingly looking at the benefits of flying machines in disaster zones. Watch: Flying robots inspired by birds . ""A ground robot will very quickly be limited -- even a staircase is difficult. If you need to reach people on the fifth floor of a building, it won't be able to do it,"" said Briod. ""Flying allows you to overcome large obstacles. And it provides an elevated point of view -- it's very useful to have an image of the scene from eye level, than from the floor."" Clever design . So how does Gimball work? With a 37 centimeter diameter, the robot is a little larger than a basketball. Featuring a stable inner frame, and a rotating outer frame made of 90 flexible carbon rods, it is able to bounce off surfaces without damaging the machine. While other robots might need heavy sensors to help avoid collisions, GimBall keeps things light, weighing just 370 grams. Two propellers help it fly along at 5 kilometers per hour, with enough battery power to last five minutes. It can either be remote controlled, or fly autonomously, sending back footage to operators. Briod now hopes the pioneering design will be used in real lifesaving missions within the next year, and said we were on the brink of a new era in technology where drones were used in everyday life. ""Up until now, the military had all the drones out there, but in the last few years there's been a huge development in civilian use,"" he said. ""Technology is developing really fast in the field of remote control -- drones are used in rescue missions, fire, or inspecting unstable buildings, bridges, and boats."" Sci-Fi future . The research team recently took GimBall for a spin in a Swiss woodland, watching it smash into trees, roll along uneven ground, and negotiate branches -- all without damaging its inner workings. It appeared like a rogue alien aircraft that had been left behind on a mission to Earth. So what is it about flying robots that continues to capture our imaginations in a way few other pieces of tech can? ""It's not limited to 2D -- that's what fascinates people, this freedom to move in the third dimension,"" said Briod. ""And seeing your creation flying is extremely satisfying.""","Introducing GimBall, the flying robot that moves like a fly .

"After a weekend of intense investigation, authorities are piecing together more details about Friday's fatal shooting at Los Angeles International Airport, including the suspect's behavior earlier in the week and a warning from his family that may have come minutes too late. Officers sent to check on Paul Ciancia's welfare arrived at his apartment less than an hour after the shooting started, police said Monday. Here is a rundown to get you up to speed: . The suspect . Ciancia, 23, of Los Angeles, is charged with murder of a federal officer and commission of violence in an international airport. He was shot by officers Friday and was in critical condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Sunday. A source said Ciancia was unable to speak to investigators. Clues about a motive . Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that more investigation is necessary to uncover a motive for the attack. But a note found on Ciancia indicated that he wanted to kill Transportation Security Administration employees to ""instill fear"" in what the suspect called the agents' ""traitorous minds,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich said. According to someone who knew Ciancia and his three roommates well, Ciancia began asking for a ride to the airport days before the shooting. He claimed he needed to fly to New Jersey to help his sick father, but he never said what day he needed to leave, the source said. On Friday, Ciancia burst into a roommate's room and demanded a ride to the airport immediately, said the source, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity. The roommate obliged. Investigators don't think the roommate had any idea of Ciancia's plans. The near-save . Around the same time, Ciancia was sending text messages to family members in Pennsville, New Jersey. One suggested that something bad would happen. Although Ciancia has no known history of mental illness, he said in the texts that he was unhappy, and the messages were alarming enough that Ciancia's father decided to call police. ""I felt that it was pretty serious. It sounded as if Paul Ciancia in California was thinking about harming himself, so obviously I knew I needed to make a phone call to the LAPD,"" Pennsville Police Chief Allen Cummings told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday. Cummings spoke with a lieutenant there, who told him the department was in the middle of responding to a shooting at LAX. ""At this point, we weren't connecting the dots,"" he said. They did later when a reporter called the police chief, asking him to comment on the shooting. Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. Andy Smith says police were first called to check on Ciancia at 10:06 a.m. Officers arrived at his apartment six minutes later, according to Smith. Ciancia was already gone. The timeline provided Monday by police differed from that offered earlier by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He said police had arrived at Ciancia's apartment about 45 minutes after the suspect had left for the airport. According to the LAPD account, they arrived 52 minutes after the shooting, which began about 9:20 a.m., according to police. It was not immediately clear when Ciancia left for the airport. The attack . About 9:20 a.m. Friday, Ciancia walked up to a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint in Terminal 3. He pulled a .223-caliber assault rifle from a bag and shot TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez ""at point-blank range,"" according to a court document filed by an FBI agent. Ciancia then went up an escalator but returned to shoot Hernandez again, apparently after seeing him move. He continued walking and shooting. Witnesses said he went from person to person, asking, ""Are you TSA?"" ""I just shook my head,"" traveler Leon Saryan told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And he kept going."" Chaos and terror inside LAX Terminal 3 . The victims . Hernandez, 39, was the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty since the agency was created in 2001. ""He took pride in his duty for the American public and for the TSA mission,"" said his wife, Ana Hernandez. The couple, who married in 1998, have two children. Two other TSA officers -- James Speer, 54, and Tony Grigsby, 36 -- were wounded but were released from the hospital. Grigsby, who was shot in the foot, told reporters Monday he was injured while helping an elderly man move to a safe area. ""I turned around and there was a gunman,"" he said. ""Shot me twice."" A traveler who was shot in the leg, 29-year-old Brian Ludmer of Lake Forest, Illinois, was in fair condition Sunday. The police response . TSA officers are unarmed. So it was airport police officers who eventually shot Ciancia multiple times in the chest, also striking him in the face and neck. Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said the FBI told him that his officers were 60 seconds behind Ciancia. He praised their response, even though he acknowledged that he had moved his officers away from positions inside the checkpoints during the past year. ""The threat ... at the airport does not exist behind security at that podium; the threat exists from the curbline on,"" Gannon said. ""So ... we have our people stationed throughout the airport."" Holder said Monday that the investigation will include a review of security measures at LAX and other airports. ""The responsibility for protecting airport security is not a TSA function but something that I think we need to certainly examine, given what happened in Los Angeles,"" he said. Travel delays . The incident forced authorities to shut down parts of the airport, evacuate travelers and put a temporary hold on some departures and landings. More than 167,050 airline passengers were affected by the incident Friday as a result of cancellations, delays or diversions to other airports, according to LAX. One airline, JetBlue, temporarily moved its operations to Long Beach Airport. On Saturday, an additional 40 flights were affected, including 30 that were canceled, involving about 4,000 passengers, according to Los Angeles International Airport. According to FlightAware, a flight tracking website, airlines canceled 236 flights into or out of LAX after the incident Friday morning and 27 more Saturday. An additional 919 flights were delayed over the two days, FlightAware said. Some of those cancellations and delays may have been caused by problems other than the shooting, however. The airport was operating normally Monday morning. Suspect's family responds . Ciancia's family, in a statement read Monday afternoon by attorney John Jordan in New Jersey, said they were ""shocked and numbed by the tragic events of last Friday."" ""It is most important for us as a family to express our deep and sincere sympathy to the Hernandez family,"" the Ciancia family said. ""(By) all accounts, Officer Hernandez was an exemplary member of the law enforcement community and a good family man. Our hearts go out to his family and many others who grieve his passing. ""We wish to convey, too, our hopes that those who were wounded during this incident will experience quick and full recoveries. We also regret the inconvenience experienced by thousands of travelers as well as the administration and the employees of the Los Angeles airport."" The Ciancia family said they would ""continue to love and care for"" Paul. ""We will support him during the difficult times ahead. While we do not mean to minimize the grief and distress experienced by many other families, we hope that the public will understand that this is a very difficult time for our family, too,"" the family said. What's next? If convicted, Ciancia could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole. The U.S. attorney general would decide whether to pursue a death sentence. TSA Administrator John Pistole said the shooting has prompted a review of security protocol with partner agencies. McCaul said better coordination with local law enforcement could improve security at checkpoints. But the congressman acknowledged that ""it's very difficult to stop these types of attacks."" ""It's almost like an open shopping mall,"" he said. Opinion: Don't arm the TSA .","An injured officer says he was shot while trying to help an elderly man move to safety .

"Australian residents lived in fear of a ""megafire"" Monday as dozens of bush blazes threaten to converge after already consuming thousands of hectares of land. Officials also warned that a smoke cloud over Sydney may affect residents' health, as the broken promise of rain may make firefighters' already daunting task more difficult. ""The fuel bed is very, very dry. We've had a series of high wind, high temperature, low humidity days. That causes fires to run quite hard. For instance, the fire that started last Thursday ran 35 kilometers in one day,"" said Stuart Midgely, a  New South Wales Rural Fire Service incident controller  and the top coordinator for the Blue Mountains blaze. As Wednesday promises more wind and higher temperatures, crews are working ""to get containment lines in as deep as we can before that bad weather comes back and potentially blows the fires back up again,"" he said. Compounding matters is ""fairly widespread"" lightning in western New South Wales, storms that are being accompanied by little to no rain, said Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. ""We are not expecting any meaningful rainfall to be of any benefit across any of the current fire grounds,"" he said, noting that the rain forecast for the weekend never materialized. What you need to know about wildfires . Destruction spreading . The fires are swallowing up large areas of bush in New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, where authorities have declared a state of emergency. More than 200 homes have been damaged or destroyed. One in three Australians live in New South Wales. In at least one town, Bilpin, firefighters were forced to stop containing the fire to focus instead on protecting homes. Forecasts of high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds over the next few days in the Blue Mountains region, west of Sydney, have state officials especially concerned. Sixty-two fires are raging in the state, 14 of them out of control, authorities said Monday. More than 1,000 firefighters are battling the blazes that have burned 116,167 hectares (about 287,000 acres) -- an area roughly the size of Los Angeles. Local officials fear that three large fires spreading through the Blue Mountains could merge to form one huge inferno. ""If they do join up and push to the south, there is the potential that many heavily inhabited suburbs along the Great Western Highway in our Blue Mountains region may be directly impacted by fire,"" said Alex Chesser, a spokesman for the fire service. ""It is unusual to see fires this size so close to Sydney,"" he said. ""And this one does pose a significant amount of risk to hundreds of thousands of properties in the Blue Mountains area, should the wind change."" Anatomy of a bush fire: How Australia's explosive forest fires work . Total fire ban . The state of emergency issued by authorities gives firefighters and police the authority to carry out measures such as cutting off water, power and gas and ordering mandatory evacuations of areas at risk. Firefighters in the Blue Mountains worked hard Monday ""back-burning"" -- using small, controlled fires to burn away flammable material in a bush fire's expected path -- to try to get the upper hand on the most threatening fires. A total fire ban is in place for the Greater Sydney region until further notice, officials have said, meaning no fire may be lit in the open, and all fire permits are suspended. The fires have spread a cloak of smog over Sydney in recent days. The bush fires in the area spread out of control Thursday amid high temperatures and powerful winds. Emergency officials said the region is emerging from a very dry winter and has had little rain in recent months. The causes of the Blue Mountains fires are still under investigation -- officials are looking into whether one major blaze was caused by a military training exercise. 2 boys arrested . Police said Monday they had arrested two boys, age 11 and 15, over two earlier bush fires in the Port Stephens area, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Sydney, that began October 13. One of the fires they are accused of starting burned more than 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) in the surrounding area. The 11-year-old has been charged with two counts of intentionally causing fire and being reckless as to its spread, NSW Police Force said, and the 15-year-old is expected to be charged. The linking of the boys to the start of those fires has come as ""quite a shock to the local community, to authorities and to the fire crews who have been working so hard to put these fires out,"" said Cameron Price, a reporter from Sky News Australia. One volunteer firefighter, Michael Green, reported making a harrowing drive through the fire lines to his home in the mountain town of Dargan. He said he and his wife could feel the intense heat through their windows. The fire had passed, but burned trees were still glowing red and the hot spots ""were still quite severe,"" he said. ""It was a bit risky, but I had to get home to see if the house was all right, and the dog,"" Green said. They were. ""It's just a lucky wind change,"" said Green, who shot video of his dash through the burned-out countryside on Thursday. ""The winds were blowing right up, and at the last minute, they changed into a southerly, which took it away from the actual house."" At least one death has been reported. A 63-year-old man died of a suspected heart attack Friday while defending his home against a blaze on the New South Wales Central Coast, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, or ABC, reported. Walter Lindner collapsed while working alongside his neighbor to save his heritage-listed homestead, according to ABC.","Officials worry about smoke cloud over Sydney, lack of rain in area .

"For more than 30 years, Dan Dominguez helped operate the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station near San Diego. Now he's helping to button it up for good. Dominguez is one of nearly 600 people still working at the two-reactor plant, down from a work force of more than 1,500 when the plant was still running -- ""all solid, middle-class jobs,"" he said. ""A lot of them have already moved on,"" Dominguez said. They've gone to work for other U.S. nuclear plants, for conventionally fueled plants or other arms of the electrical power industry, he said. And a few have gone to work overseas, where other countries are building new nuclear plants. ""Three or four of our guys, maybe five, went to work in Abu Dhabi,"" said Dominguez, who's also the business manager for Local 246 of the Utility Workers Union of America. ""Another one went to South Korea."" Not long ago, nuclear energy seemed poised to start a much-touted renaissance in the United States. Buoyed by forecasts of increased demand, utilities were gearing up to start building the first new reactors since the 1970s. Concerns about the emissions from carbon-rich fossil fuels blamed for global warming started to offset public fears about safety that had lingered since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. Read CNN's quick facts about U.S. nuclear power plants . Map: How close are you to nuclear waste? (PDF) But since then, the industry has seen a dramatic reversal of fortune. And while some environmentalists, like those featured in the CNN Films' documentary ""Pandora's Promise,"" now argue that nuclear power is needed to head off climate change, the market has become a hostile place. ""The industry got hit between the eyes by a number of things happening at once,"" said Peter Bradford, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission member. Related: 'Pandora's Promise' Five new reactors are currently being built, in Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee. But in the past year, utilities have permanently shut down four others and plan to take a fifth out of service next year. At least two other planned projects have been shelved. The projected increases in electric demand didn't materialize, tamped down by the steep recession of 2007-2009 and increasing efficiencies and conservation measures, Bradford said. Then, a revolution in drilling techniques produced a boom in cheap natural gas. And during the recession, long-debated efforts to limit carbon emissions through a ""cap-and-trade"" system failed to make it through Congress. The Environmental Protection Agency forecast that cap-and-trade would have led utilities to produce more nuclear plants, which produce large amounts of power without releasing carbon dioxide. ""Looking back as sort of an armchair quarterback, it really turns out the nuclear industry needed some kind of cap-and-trade or strong carbon regulation to get back off the ground,"" said David Solan, director of the Energy Policy Institute at Idaho's Boise State University. Related: Ads warn against taxing carbon emissions . Then in 2011, the historic Japanese earthquake and tsunami triggered the worst nuclear accident since the Soviet Union's Chernobyl disaster in 1986, bringing safety issues back into the spotlight. Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in northeastern Japan melted down after the tsunami swamped the plant and knocked out its emergency power systems. Though no fatalities have been blamed on the accident, the resulting contamination displaced more than 100,000 people, and the cleanup and damages have left Japan's largest utility on life support. Solan called it a ""body blow"" to the American nuclear establishment, following the gas revolution and the failure of government attempts to impose a price on carbon emissions. ""Fracking,"" the use of hydraulic fracturing to break open underground rock formations that hold natural gas, has driven the cost of that fuel sharply downward. Gas-fired power plants are far faster and cheaper to build than nuclear plants, which can take a decade and cost billions of dollars to get up and running. And while gas isn't carbon-free, it puts out about half the carbon emissions of coal. The shift toward selling electricity on regional grids, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest, has pitted nuclear-generated power directly against gas -- and nuclear is losing, Solan said. ""From a generation standpoint, it's really hard for them to make money in those markets,"" he said. David Crane, the head of the utility conglomerate NRG, predicted in April that natural gas would wipe out both coal and nuclear power. NRG had sought to build two new reactors in south Texas but abandoned the project in 2011, citing high costs and the ""extraordinary challenges"" facing the industry after Fukushima Daiichi. ""I don't necessarily think at least the second of those is a good thing,"" Crane said. ""But I think it's inevitable outside of government intervention, which I don't think is going to happen."" In Vermont, the single-reactor Vermont Yankee plant will close in 2014 after its owner, Entergy, decided in August that it was no longer ""financially viable."" Dominion Power shut down its Kewaunee plant in Wisconsin in May, a decision it said was ""based purely on economics."" Duke Energy announced in February that it would write off its Crystal River plant in Florida, which had been idled since 2009 for repairs to its concrete containment building. And San Onofre had been offline for more than a year when its owner, Southern California Edison, announced in June that it wouldn't reopen. The plant shut down in 2012 after a gas leak revealed problems in its massive new steam generators, which had just been replaced at a cost of nearly $700 million. SCE said the ""continuing uncertainty"" over the plant's future ""was not good for our customers, our investors, or the need to plan for our region's long-term electricity needs."" Read more about the closing of Vermont Yankee . Bradford, the former NRC member, said utilities have been unable to draw investors for new plants, forcing them to rely on loan guarantees from the federal government -- and on customers in states like Georgia and Florida, which have allowed regulated public utilities to charge them for plants still under construction. ""The fundamental problem was the renaissance was always economically unsound,"" Bradford said. ""There was never a point in time at which private investors were prepared to back new nuclear. There were just too many things that could go wrong."" And while the zero-carbon promise of nuclear power may be appealing, the billions it would take to build a nuclear plant could better be spent to develop renewable energy sources like wind and solar, boost conservation efforts and improve fuel efficiency for motor vehicles, he said. Climate change warriors: It's time to go nuclear . ""The problem with using nuclear as an answer to climate change is it's so much more expensive than other potential answers,"" Bradford said. ""It's like building palaces to solve a housing shortage, or using caviar to solve world hunger."" Dominguez said his co-workers aren't likely to have trouble finding jobs -- ""There's a lot of skills that are transferable,"" he told CNN. But he also calls himself ""a climate change guy,"" and said most of the 2,200 megawatts of electricity that San Onofre used to produce will now be replaced by carbon-emitting fossil fuel plants rather than renewable. ""The only greenhouse gases that San Onofre created was the smokers up on the top of the deck, when they would get together and smoke,"" he said.","Cheap natural gas, Fukushima and no carbon limits hurt promised ""nuclear renaissance""

"So long, margarine: Artificial trans fat in foods may eventually become a thing of the past. The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday took a first step toward potentially eliminating most trans fat from the food supply, saying it has made a preliminary determination that a major source of trans fats -- partially hydrogenated oils -- is no longer ""generally recognized as safe."" If the preliminary determination is finalized, according to the FDA, then partially hydrogenated oils will become food additives that could not be used in food without approval. Foods with unapproved additives cannot legally be sold. Trans fat can be found in processed foods including desserts, microwave popcorn products, frozen pizza, margarine and coffee creamer, and has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Partially hydrogenated oil is formed when hydrogen is added to liquid oils to make solid fats, like shortening and margarine. It increases the shelf life and the flavor of foods. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, or shortening, was used in American kitchens as early as 1911. However, in recent years many food manufacturers have taken steps to limit or eliminate trans fat from their products. McDonald's, for instance, stopped cooking its french fries in trans fat more than a decade ago. The company's website says all its fried menu items are free of trans fat. New York City in 2007 adopted a regulation banning partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and spreads in restaurants. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday that he was encouraged by the FDA's move. ""The groundbreaking public health policies we have adopted here in New York City have become a model for the nation for one reason: They've worked. Today, New Yorkers' life expectancy is far higher than the national average, and we've achieved dramatic reductions in disease, including heart disease. The FDA deserves great credit for taking this step, which will help Americans live longer, healthier lives,"" Bloomberg said. Photos: The history of trans fat . Trans fat intake among American consumers decreased from 4.6 grams per day in 2003 to about a gram a day in 2012, according to the FDA. However, ""current intake remains a significant public health concern,"" FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said in a written statement. There is no safe level of consumption of trans fat, Hamburg said. It has been shown to raise the ""bad,"" or LDL, cholesterol. ""Through our efforts at product reformulation and the development of suitable alternatives, trans fats that are not naturally occurring have been drastically reduced in the food supply,"" the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents more than 300 food, beverage and consumer product companies, said in a prepared statement. ""Since 2005, food manufacturers have voluntarily lowered the amounts of trans fats in their food products by over 73%."" Other countries are also working to reduce trans fat in the food supply. Policies in Brazil, Costa Rica, Denmark, the Netherlands, South Korea and the United States have proved effective over the past two decades, the World Health Organization said in April. The WHO has called for eliminating trans fat from the global food supply. WHO outlines steps to reduce leading causes of death . The FDA has opened a 60-day comment period on the determination ""to collect additional data and to gain input on the time potentially needed for food manufacturers to reformulate products that currently contain artificial trans fat should this determination be finalized,"" the agency said. There are two phases to the process, FDA officials said Thursday. The agency will evaluate the comments and evidence received during the comment period. ""If we finalize our conclusion, then we are inviting comments from industry on what would be an appropriate phaseout,"" said Michael Taylor, the agency's deputy commissioner for foods. ""The timeline would be based on the comments we get. Given the public health impact, we want to move as quickly as we can."" The National Restaurant Association noted in a statement the industry's ""tremendous strides"" in reducing or eliminating trans fats. ""We plan to discuss the impact of this proposal on the industry and submit comments, and we will continue to work with our members and the manufacturing supply chain to address any new federal standards that may arise out of this process,"" said Joan McGlockton, the association's vice president of industry affairs and food policy. Hamburg called Thursday's move ""an important step toward protecting more Americans from the potential dangers of trans fat."" The American Heart Association, the American Medical Association and the Center for Science in the Public Interest were among those praising the move. ""The scientific evidence is clear -- eating food with trans fat increases production of 'bad' cholesterol, which is a risk factor for heart disease,"" the AHA said. So what should consumers do in the meantime? Choose products that have the lowest combined amount of saturated fat, cholesterol and trans fat, the FDA said. Dietary fats: Know which types to choose . Under current regulations, companies can claim their food has 0 grams of trans fat if the food contains less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, according to Mical Honigfort, a consumer safety officer at the FDA. But if partially hydrogenated oil is listed in the ingredients, there may still be a small amount of trans fat present. Nancy Brown, the Heart Association's CEO, said she hopes the FDA goes a step further and revises labels for foods that are trans fat free. The preliminary determination was based on ""available scientific evidence and the findings of expert scientific panels,"" the FDA said. The determination covers only partially hydrogenated oils, not trans fat that naturally occurs in some meat and dairy products. Trans fat is also present at very low levels in other edible oils, such as fully hydrogenated oils, where it is ""unavoidably produced during the manufacturing process,"" according to the FDA. Avoiding foods containing artificially produced trans fat could prevent 10,000 to 20,000 heart attacks and 3,000 to 7,000 coronary heart disease deaths each year, according to one study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Artificial trans fat is a uniquely powerful promoter of heart disease, and today's announcement will hasten its eventual disappearance from the food supply,"" said Michael Jacobson, the Center for Science in the Public Interest's executive director. ""Not only is artificial trans fat not safe, it's not remotely necessary. Many companies, large and small, have switched to healthier oils over the past decade. I hope that those restaurants and food manufacturers that still use this harmful ingredient see the writing on the wall and promptly replace it.""","The FDA takes a first step toward eliminating artificial trans fat in the food supply .

"(CNN)To watch or not to watch. That is the question for 12 jurors and six alternates in the Massachusetts murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez when the region's beloved Patriots play in Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday. On a day in which the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd took the stand and Lloyd's mother again left the courtroom in tears, Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Friday had a warning for the jury. ""I am not going to forbid you from watching the Super Bowl if that's something that's really important to you,"" she said. But the judge closed the second day of testimony by advising jurors to be vigilant for mention of Hernandez, who helped lead the Patriots to Super Bowl XLVI nearly three years ago. ""You hear that word, you've got to walk out of the room,"" Garsh said. ""Distance yourself."" Hernandez will not be watching his former team. He's incarcerated in a high security unit where prisoners are forbidden from watching TV. Hernandez, 25, pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Lloyd, 27, who dated the sister of Hernandez's fiancée. Two alleged accomplices, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. As she did one day earlier, Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, walked out of the courtroom sobbing as prosecutors showed the jury graphic photos of her son's body. Lloyd, who was shot six times, was shown lying on his back in the industrial park where his body was found. Later Friday, Shaneah Jenkins, 23, who was dating Lloyd at the time of his death, took the witness stand. Her sister, Shayanna, is Hernandez's fiancee and mother of his child. Shaneah Jenkins testified that she introduced Lloyd to Hernandez on her birthday in August 2012. Jenkins told the jury that Lloyd and Hernandez were in the ""beginning stages of a friendship."" She said the two men and others would gather in Hernandez's basement ""man cave"" -- with fitness and theater rooms, a bar and pool table emblazoned with the Patriots' logo -- to smoke marijuana. But Jenkins said she was not aware of her boyfriend and Hernandez hanging out except for the day Lloyd was killed. In opening statements Thursday, defense lawyer Michael Fee said the two men were close friends and that Hernandez had no reason to kill Lloyd. Fee described the victim as one of his client's ""partying pals"" who was known as the ""blunt master'' for the marijuana cigars he often procured for Hernandez. The two men could have been brothers-in-law, he said. ""Aaron Hernandez is not the murderer of his friend,"" Fee said. ""In June 2013, Aaron Hernandez was planning his future, not a murder."" The case has divided the Jenkins sisters, who sit on opposite sides of the courtroom -- Shaneah with Lloyd's mother and Shayanna with Hernandez's family. Shayanna was not in court Friday. Other witnesses Friday described how Lloyd's body was found near Hernandez's house. One man said he saw the victim on his back, stiff and motionless, with ""flies flying in and out of his nose."" In the front row, Lloyd's mother wept. On Thursday, prosecutor Patrick Bomberg said Hernandez not only orchestrated, but also participated in and covered up the killing. Bomberg summed up the prosecution's largely circumstantial case, telling the jury that Hernandez and his associates killed Lloyd and then ""took evidence with them and tried to and, in some cases were successful, in destroying evidence."" The three picked up Lloyd and drove to a secluded area where he was shot and killed, Bomberg said. A marijuana blunt found near Lloyd's body had traces of both his DNA and that of Hernandez, Bomberg said. Hernandez's DNA also was found on a .45-caliber shell casing found in a car he had rented. A footprint at the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found matched sneakers worn by Hernandez, the prosecutor said. Though the motive for the killing is unclear, Bomberg said Lloyd and Hernandez were at a nightclub days before and the defendant appeared annoyed. Hernandez was angry when he left the club. The defense said the one-time NFL star worth $40 million was targeted by police and prosecutors in the death of the semipro football player because of celebrity status. Hernandez ""never had a chance"" as authorities zeroed in, Fee told the jury. Fee sought to plant doubt in the jury, saying police went after Hernandez from the start. ""As soon as they found out Aaron Hernandez -- a celebrity football player for the New England Patriots -- was a friend of Odin Lloyd's, it was over,"" he said. The prosecution will try to ""dazzle and distract you"" with the fruits of an investigation that was ""sloppy and unprofessional,"" Fee said. The case against his client is ""just a story and it's not true,"" he added. The prosecutors will argue that Lloyd's killing was a ""joint venture."" Under Massachusetts state law, prosecutors don't necessarily have to prove who pulled the trigger. Under joint venture, anyone who actively participates in a killing can be found guilty, according to legal experts. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in a black Chevrolet Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez. Close friend Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later. Lloyd's body was found the next day. The judge has blocked any mention that Hernandez was indicted in connection with two other killings in Boston. Hernandez pleaded not guilty in the shooting deaths of Ernesto Abreu and Safiro Furtado outside a bar in Boston in 2012. A trial date hasn't been set. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Laura Dolan contributed to this report.","Judge closes Day Two of Aaron Hernandez murder trial with a warning .

"(CNN)So, are the Super Bowl's two head coaches a couple of caught-red-handed cheaters? Is Seattle's top running back a tight-lipped, lewd lout? Is a standout Seahawk defensive back a big-mouthed braggart? Is the superstar Patriot quarterback a dishonest dude or a scatterbrain? And what about that former New England pass catcher who's been charged with cold-blooded murder? Let's not forget about him. Ah, welcome to Super Bowl week, during which we will hear countless hours of well-deserved blah-blah-blah praise about the skills of the participants, while simultaneously wondering about the gentlemen in charge on each sideline, or about the true personality that lies hidden behind each player's face mask. Are these men to admire? Do we need them to be? Many of us on Sunday will merely want to eat our Buffalo wings, watch the Budweiser horses and puppies in the TV commercials and see what Katy Perry is or isn't wearing when she sings at halftime, then get back to the game to decide if Seattle or New England will be ""world champions"" (even though teams from the rest of the world are not invited). But this year, more than any past year, it seems, the National Football League is coming under scrutiny more for the kind of product it is producing OFF the field of play. The physical abuse of women or children by some players has made headlines. As has this latest focus of attention, a brouhaha over whether New England quarterback Tom Brady — deliberately or otherwise — used a ""deflated"" football in a conference championship game that was allegedly much easier to pass and catch than the opposing team's ball. The image problem of the NFL as a league of thugs and punks won't be helped by the publicity surrounding the case of 25-year-old Aaron Hernandez, once a tight end for the Patriots, which goes to trial this week. Hernandez is accused of the 2013 murder of a semi-pro football player named Odin Lloyd. And you could feel the league's executives cringe when the entire focus of a January 18 game between the Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts turned out to be not which side would be proceeding to the Super Bowl, but whether the winners somehow managed to use a football that was not properly inflated. It didn't help that Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who has denied knowing anything about the deflated balls, has previously had to answer to accusations of unethically ""spying"" on another team. Belichick was fined $500,000 by the NFL in 2007 after it became clear that the Patriots had filmed the New York Jets' defensive signals. It was the largest such fine in the league's history, and the team itself got slapped with an additional $250,000 penalty. But for those who think Belichick a sinner and Seattle's coach a saint, keep in mind that Pete Carroll, coach of the Seahawks, was in charge of a University of Southern California program that was handed a two-year bowl ban among other sanctions for alleged wrongdoing, including, AP noted, ""improper benefits to Heisman Trophy winner Reggie Bush."" Carroll left for the NFL while others remained behind, paying for what occurred at USC under his watch. Meanwhile, Carroll's current team has been stoking the Patriots controversy, with outspoken defensive back Richard Sherman seeming to insinuate that the NFL's commissioner and Patriots' owner were so buddy-buddy the Pats would go unpunished. And his teammate, Marshawn Lynch, has reportedly been fined twice this season already for making lewd gestures while celebrating a touchdown. What he might pull on Sunday is now anybody's guess. Fools and clowns have been omnipresent at NFL games for years, most of them receivers. What began innocently enough many decades ago, when a New York Giants receiver, Homer Jones, ""spiked"" the football after a touchdown pass, has snowballed into a succession of look-at-me acts. There was Terrell Owens pulling a Sharpie out of his sock after a touchdown and autographing the ball (for which he reportedly received a $20,000 fine), Joe Horn hiding a mobile phone behind a goal post and pretending to make a call on it ($30,000 fine), and Chad Johnson doing a Riverdance, pretending to propose to a cheerleader, donning a jacket implying he was bound for the Hall of Fame, and even holding up a sign reading ""Dear NFL, PLEASE don't fine me AGAIN!!!!!"" (for which he earned another $10,000 fine). There's been plenty more: Golden Tate waved goodbye to opponents as he ran to the end zone, Wes Welker made a snow angel, Randy Moss pretended to moon another team's fans, and Tony Gonzalez and others ""dunked"" the ball over the goal-post crossbar after touchdowns. The New Orleans Saints' Jimmy Graham may have gotten the dunk banned when he almost brought the crossbar down doing it one game. TV sportscaster Bob Costas got so sick of it, he once aired a commentary deriding football's ""mindless exhibitionism"" and ""buffoonery,"" saying there's a difference between genuine enthusiasm and what Costas called ""calculated displays of obnoxious self-indulgence."" ""No Fun League"" is a tag the NFL acquired after attempting to limit some of its athletes' outlandish acts. But as we can see from recent events, ""no fun"" is the least of the league's worries.

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN)At least 48 people were killed and dozens others injured Friday in what authorities said was a bombing at a Shiite Muslim mosque in southern Pakistan, according to a local hospital. The attack took place just before Friday prayers started in the city of Shikarpur in Sindh province, said Sharjeel Mamon, the city's information minister. Fifty people were injured, said to Shaukat Ali Memon, superintendent of the Civil Hospital in Shikarpur. The militant group Jundallah claimed responsibility for the attack, the group's spokesman Ahmad Marwat said in a statement. Pakistan is a majority Sunni Muslim country. Shiites make up about 10% to 15% of the country's population, according to the CIA World Factbook. Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif strongly condemned the killings and vowed to fight terrorism.","At least 50 people wounded in bombing of a Shiite mosque .

"From his cell in a maximum security prison, terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui is reviving old allegations and making new ones against al Qaeda and a handful of Saudi royals. The 46-year old French national is claiming that Saudi Embassy officials were involved in a plot to shoot down Air Force One to assassinate Bill Clinton and/or Hillary Clinton during a trip to the United Kingdom. Moussaoui says he met with a Secret Service agent several months ago and told him what he knew. CNN has reached out to the Secret Service for comment. In two handwritten letters filed this month in federal court in New York and Oklahoma, Moussaoui claimed that, during the time he was taking flying lessons in Norman, Oklahoma, he met with a Saudi prince and princess and that she ""gave me money,"" and provided funding for 9/11 hijackers. Lawyers for the Saudi government have repeatedly denied connections, maintaining Saudi Arabia was cleared by the 9/11 Commission. Moussaoui, who suffers from mental illness, is in the supermax federal prison in Florence, Colorado, and is eight years into a life sentence, having pleaded guilty to terrorism and murder conspiracy in connection with the September 11, 2001, terror hijackings. Moussaoui claims in both letters that he was attacked in prison on orders of terrorist Ramzi Yousef, who Moussaoui says tried to stop him from testifying against the Saudis. Yousef, a convicted terrorist, is considered the mastermind in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and is in the same supermax prison as Moussaoui. It is unclear at this time if prisoners in the Colorado federal prison are able to communicate. Moussaoui claims he is being mistreated by prison officials in what he calls a ""campaign of harassment and intimidation."" Citing ""venue"" issues, Oklahoma Magistrate Judge Shon T Erwin ruled to dismiss the case of Zacarias Moussaoui v. Federal Bureau of Prisons. The court also denied a request for appointment of counsel. A ruling is not yet available with regard to the letter he sent to a New York judge. In the letters, Moussaoui asks for new lawyers and says he wants to be moved out of the H-unit within the prison, which he calls a ""Saudi stronghold."" In exchange he says he would provide information against the Saudis. He also says he wants a warmer cell, not infested with rodents. He wants authorities to unblock his source to money so he can buy stamps to write to the inspector general. Attorneys interview Moussaoui . Moussaoui reached out to a New York court, seeking lawyers for 9/11 victims, offering to provide what he believed to be important information pertaining to current 9/11 litigation, according to one of the four lead counsels, attorney Jerry Goldman. Lawyers interviewed Moussaoui in late October. The counsel believe the interview provided ""relevant"" and ""critical"" information pertinent to pending litigation, according to attorneys. The transcripts of the interview are being reviewed by the Department. of Justice and limited information can be shared about their contents, Goldman said. Lawyers for Saudi government deny involvement . In a court document filed in September in the Southern District of New York in connection to the 9/11 terror attacks, lawyers for Saudi Arabia deny involvement, financial or otherwise, saying: . ""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had no role in the attacks of September 11, 2001."" The Saudis' lawyers highlight that the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, known as the  9/11  Commission, in 2004 found ""no evidence""  ... ""the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded"" either al Qaeda or the 9/11 hijackers. The original complaint, filed over 10 years ago on behalf of victims and insurance companies, targets various terrorist organizations, and alleges Saudi involvement. Lawyers want the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to be dropped from the suit, arguing they had no involvement in 9/11 attacks. The lawyers for the 9/11 families have requested extended time to reply to the motion for dismissal. ""Plaintiffs believe that Moussaoui's sworn testimony is not only relevant, but critical to their (opposition),"" according to a court document submitted by the 9/11 lawyers. Moussaoui diagnosed with schizophrenia . The expert who literally helped write the book on diagnosing mental illness testified during Moussaoui's 2006 trial that Moussaoui is schizophrenic. Michael First, a psychiatrist who edited the latest edition of the profession's standard diagnostic guidebook, told jurors that Moussaoui also suffers from paranoid and grandiose delusions and disorganized thinking. Both Moussaoui's sisters, who lived in France at the time of the trial, were diagnosed with forms of schizophrenia and took drugs to control their symptoms. Moussaoui's father at the time of the trial was hospitalized in France with bipolar disorder. Bin Laden distanced himself from Moussaoui . 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden at the time denied Moussaoui was part of the hijacking plot. In May 2006, bin Laden released an audiotape in which he refutes Moussaoui's confession by saying, ""I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission."" Blacked out 28 pages . The U.S. government commission report investigating the 9/11 attacks cleared the Saudi Arabian government of involvement in al Qaeda funding. The commission found that Saudi Arabia was a rich fundraising ground for al Qaeda, but said it had found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior officials within the Saudi government funded al Qaeda. The Saudi government defended its nation's record in fighting terrorism, and urged then-U.S. President George W. Bush to unseal 28 classified pages of an 800-plus-page report on intelligence surrounding the September 11 attacks to allow the Saudi government to defend itself. Bush refused the request, saying declassifying the entire report, which runs more than 800 pages, would compromise intelligence sources. Some of those still grieving the loss of family members from that horrific day are also on a mission to declassify the 28 pages from the congressional investigation into the attacks, pages specifically focused on the role of foreign governments in the al Qaeda plot. These 9/11 family members say President Barack Obama promised he would declassify those 28 pages, but now they say the White House does not even acknowledge them, or their requests.","Saudis deny connection to 9/11 attacks, note 9/11 Commission said they weren't involved .

"(CNN)A Florida woman who accepted a plea bargain in a controversial ""stand your ground"" case is grateful to be out of prison and looks forward to the future. Marissa Alexander served a total of three years behind bars. She was released on Tuesday and spoke to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Wednesday. ""I'm out now. I'm looking forward to the future,"" she said. ""It wasn't easy, but I'm much stronger, and I am in a better place than I was so I'm just looking forward to moving forward."" Alexander says she was attempting to flee her husband on August 1, 2010, when she picked up a handgun and fired a shot into a wall. Nobody was struck by the bullet. The case focused the spotlight on Florida's ""stand your ground"" law after Alexander unsuccessfully argued before her trial that she was immune to prosecution because of the law. Alexander says her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband, got angry and tried to strangle her. Authorities say Alexander needed to be prosecuted because she fired in the direction of a room where children were standing. The mother of three was initially sentenced to 20 years. That conviction was overturned because the trial judge mishandled instructions to the jury. She later accepted a plea deal. Her children, Alexander said, were the main motivation behind that decision. She has twin, teenage sons and a 4-year-old daughter. About her youngest, she said: ""We're in love. So I'm grateful to be able to have, you know, the relationship that we have, and she knows that I'm her mom and that I'm not going anywhere."" Although she has been released, Alexander will spend the next two years under a kind of house arrest, wearing an ankle bracelet.

"(CNN)The unfortunate part of any public debate about politics these days is that it almost inevitably turns polemical. This has certainly been the case with the conversation  over ""Selma,"" the powerful new movie that examines the grass-roots protests that produced the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965. As soon as the movie opened, it provoked an intense controversy about its portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson. Although most of the movie centers on civil rights activists who organized the marches for voting rights in March 1965, some critics have argued that the depiction of LBJ, played by Tom Wilkinson, was misleading on two fronts. The critics argue that the movie depicts the President as indifferent or even hostile to voting rights until King really forces his hand. The movie, in their minds, understates how much he wanted the voting legislation to pass from the very time of his reelection in November 1964. Former presidential adviser Joe Califano (who went so far as to credit on LBJ for giving King the idea of Selma), LBJ Library Director Mark Updegrove and others also claim that the movie depicts LBJ as responsible for the FBI wiretaps into the private life of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., culminating with Coretta King receiving tapes of the leader sleeping with another woman, when the authorization for the wiretapping happened under President John Kennedy, his brother Robert who was the attorney general, and J. Edgar Hoover. (Full disclosure: I am one of the people who has raised concerns about some of these issues). For some people, however, this criticism quickly rolled over into questions about whether the movie deserved to be nominated for the Oscars and if the movie as a whole was any good. One columnist, who admitted being moved to tears upon watching it, wrote that if ""Selma"" wins the academy award, ""truth loses."" Those on the other side of the debate have raised many objections as well -- to the critics rather than the movie. They have insisted that the movie really was about the impact of grass-roots activists, not about Lyndon Johnson. They have been particularly frustrated with Califano's suggestion that the idea for Selma came from LBJ. In their viewing of the movie, the narrative about Johnson was also more complex than the critics contended. Some of them have a different read of how Johnson is portrayed, disputing the notion that he comes off as indifferent to voting rights. But this side has also unfortunately descended into nastier attacks with unfounded allegations that there has been some kind of a ""smear"" campaign to prevent the film from receiving awards. It would be great if those involved in this debate could keep their attention on the very important issues that have been raised by Ava Duvernay's film. In addition to a stirring look at the work that was undertaken by brave civil rights activists who marched right into a brutally violent response from police authorities, she has triggered a vibrant debate about one of the most important issues in American political history: the complex relationship between presidents and grass-roots activists. How do Washington leaders and movement activists interact in the passage of legislation? How does social action lead to political change? What can presidents and Congress to do respond to social pressure? What are some of the competing demands that each faces in pursuing their goals? This is the kind of issue that is usually only of interest to political junkies and academic scholars. But because of this film, Duvernay has pushed this question to the front and center of national debate. Moviegoers are talking about the kinds of issues too often confined to the classroom. The nature of the relationship between presidents and grass-roots activists has been at the heart of most important moments in American politics. During the 1930s, organized labor pressured President Franklin Roosevelt into moving forward with the Wagner Act of 1935, legislation that legitimated unions and created the National Labor Relations Board. During the 1960s, LBJ constantly turned to civil rights activists to help him build the kind of pressure on Congress and public opinion that was necessary for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He always knew that arm-twisting and trading pork could only go so far. In turn, activists like King counted on Johnson to be a president who would take advantage of the favorable political conditions when they emerged so that the bloodshed was not in vain. During the 1980s, the conservative movement maintained political pressure on President Ronald Reagan to stay true to its principles, such as insisting on tax cuts and sticking to a hawkish stance against communism. Sometimes the relationship between presidents and activists has been a partnership, as was the case with LBJ and King in 1965, while at other moments this has broken down into an adversarial situation where neither side believed that the other was serving their interest. This was the case when Johnson treated anti-war activists as his enemies for their protests about Vietnam or when conservatives railed against President George H.W. Bush for having increased taxes in 1990, or when the right turned against his son after 2004 for allowing the federal government to grow. This relationship has been very much on the minds of many Americans during the current presidency. Under President Obama, there have been many twists and turns in this story. Early on in his presidency, Obama depended on the momentum and fervor generated from the groups that helped him win office in 2008 as he pushed for the Affordable Care Act and financial regulation. But since the 2010 midterm elections, there have been many progressive groups, such as environmentalists and labor organizers, who have been frustrated with the feeling that the President has turned a cold shoulder to their causes as he tries to deal with an obstructionist Congress. These kinds of questions are central to my new book about Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society, as I attempted to show that it is impossible to understand why so many domestic programs passed in the mid-1960s without grasping the impact that civil rights activists and voters (in the election of 1964) had on Congress between 1963 and the midterm elections of 1966. Although I have raised questions about how the film depicts President Johnson on voting rights, the basic message of the film resonates with the story that I try to tell in my book. At a personal level, it has been inspiring to see how Duvernay has been able to extend this conversation to a bigger audience, including young people. Let's hope that those who seek to turn this debate about ""Selma"" into accusation and slander, such as dismissing all criticism about the treatment of LBJ as a smear campaign or those who brush off the entire value of the film because of this depiction, take a step back from the table, leaving space for those who want a serious and legitimate discussion. Movies and television shows have often been effective at triggering robust conversations about politics for a broader public. The filmmaker deserves for her work to be treated with this kind of respect given the important work that she has done. We can't allow this to become one more political football in the partisan wars of our time. ​ .","""Selma"" triggered historical debate and claims that some were trying to ""smear"" the movie .

"(CNN)It's like something from a sports movie: A teen in a basketball uniform makes an improbable shot, then gets hoisted on the shoulders of his teammates while the crowd cheers and chants his name. But Nicholas Bennett, a senior at North Hall High School in Gainesville, Georgia, didn't hit a game-winning basket. His achievement last Saturday was even rarer. Bennett, who has autism, has served as the Trojans' student manager all four years he's been in high school. His duties include keeping the gym clean and making sure the basketballs are properly inflated. And for fun, he practices taking half-court shots. He set a goal of making 1,000 such shots before graduating -- a lofty goal for anyone, let alone a kid who is not an official player on the basketball team. But he kept at it, and over the years teammates and coaches kept count as Nicholas came in early to shoot or heaved up half-court shots during practice. When Bennett reached 999 made shots, coach Tyler Sanders put him in his first-ever varsity game on Saturday against rival Gainesville High. Nicholas scored the first basket of the game on an uncontested layup, then went to the bench and high-fived his coach to cheers from the crowd. But the real highlight came at halftime, when he stepped to half court and began launching shots in his trademark underhand style. On his third try, the ball sailed cleanly through the net. Number 1,000 was his. Bennett raised his hands in triumph, and the gym erupted in cheers. In a storybook moment, he was lifted on his teammates' shoulders to chants of ""Nick! Nick!""

"Inspired by a U.S. fact-checking website, a group of Egyptian activists has created the Morsi Meter, aimed at holding the new Egyptian president to his promises. It's ""an attempt to document and monitor the performance of Egyptian President-elect Mohamed Morsi"" over his first 100 days, the Morsi Meter website says. Much like the Obameter from PolitiFact.com, which tracks U.S. President Barack Obama's promises, the Morsi Meter lists numerous promises Morsi allegedly made while campaigning for the presidency, including offering incentives and promotions for police who restore security in their areas, new penalties for smuggling fuel, and changes on the streets to improve traffic. It's a project of Zabatak, a non-profit group that says its goal is to fight crime and corruption. Amr Sobhy, a 24-year-old organizer with the group, told CNN the idea for the Morsi Meter sprang from a conversation he had with another young activist.  ""We decided to follow U.S.-like initiatives of monitoring the promises of politicians after the naming of the president,"" and one member of Zabatak began to write down Morsi's campaign vows, Sobhy said. ""We are a group of Egyptians who don't belong to any political ideology and, for the record, we are not by any means political activists,"" he said. ""We are average Egyptian youths who want to use whatever they do best to bring about change in Egypt."" Egypt elections: 'Women need a champion' Sobhy said he voted for Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, over Ahmed Shafik, who served as the final prime minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak.  It was ""a choice between revolution and reproducing the past regime."" The group has not heard of any reaction from Morsi to the website. Unlike the U.S. presidency, Egypt's presidency is largely a figurehead position -- particularly after the military junta running Egypt recently claimed full legislative and budgetary authority and said the president has no control over the military. Sobhy said that while it's unclear how much power the president will have, he hopes Morsi fulfills promises through selecting ""a good government"" and gaining public support. ""What matters to me here is how much support we are gaining, unexpectedly,"" for the Morsi Meter, he said.  He believes it will help change how candidates look at the electorate. Sobhy said he got the Morsi Meter online before leaving for a conference in Bonn, Germany. Zabatak hopes to change the ""mindset"" in Egypt and get more people to be ""more positive and involved,"" he said. ""We want to bring Egypt to a new era of accountability, open government and citizen involvement,"" Sobhy explained. The site is not about ""criticism or advocacy,"" he added.  ""It's a portal of data.  People can use it later, as much as they like, to form whatever opinions they want to hold."" The site currently lists 64 promises. Sobhy says the group will soon launch an official English version. The Obameter, from Pulitzer Prize-winning PolitiFact.com, currently lists about 500 promises Obama made while campaigning for the presidency.  It says he has kept 37%, broken 14%, and compromised on another 12%. ""I know of similar efforts we've inspired in France, Poland and Afghanistan,"" PolitiFact Editor Bill Adair said Tuesday. ""We're thrilled that journalists around the world are adopting the approach of our Obameter. It's a new form of journalism that holds public officials accountable for their campaign promises. It shows the power of the Web and the value of accountability journalism."" What is the Muslim Brotherhood?","The Morsi Meter is modeled after the Obameter from PolitiFact.com .

"(CNN)Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Monday stood by his criticism of so-called ""no-go"" zones in Europe, where sovereign nations allegedly cede authority to Muslim immigrants, a controversial idea that many critics say is overblown. And the potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate decried what he called immigrants' insistence on ""non-assimilation, the fact that ""you've got people who want to come to our country but not adopt our values,"" which he called ""dangerous."" Jindal has the reputation of policy wonk among Republicans and boldly told GOP officials during a 2013 address to the Republican National Committee that they ""must stop being the stupid party"" and needed to ""stop insulting the intelligence of voters."" Asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer whether he would walk back his comments on no-go zones, made in a speech to the Henry Jackson Society in London earlier that day, Jindal said, ""not at all."" MSNBC guest won't apologize for Jindal remark . ""And I'm also making a bigger and maybe even more controversial point that radical Islam is a grave threat, we need Muslim leaders to denounce the individuals, not just the acts of violence,"" he said, adding that ""it is absolutely correct to insist on assimilation"" of immigrants in the United States. But pressed for specific examples of such no-go zones, Jindal demurred, saying he had met with ""elected officials and others"" to discuss them and noted a report in UK tabloid the Daily Mail that purported to highlight the challenges facing law enforcement in such areas. ""I knew by speaking the truth we were gonna make people upset,"" Jindal told Blitzer. Jindal was also unable to offer examples during an earlier interview with CNN's Max Foster, saying that he's ""heard from folks here that there are neighborhoods where women don't feel comfortable going in without veils ... We all know that there are neighborhoods where police are less likely to go into."" ""I think that the radical Left absolutely wants to pretend like this problem is not here. Pretending it's not here won't make it go away,"" he told Foster. Pressed for details, Jindal said only, ""I think your viewers know absolutely there are places where the police are less likely to go."" And asked whether that feeling may be caused by high crime rates, rather than the Muslim population in the area, Jindal said, ""This isn't a question."" ""I know the Left wants to make this into an attack on religion and that's not what this is. What we are saying, it's absolutely an issue for the UK, absolutely is an issue for America and other European and Western nations,"" he said. During his London speech, Jindal said, ""In the West, non-assimilationist Muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of Sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home,"" according to prepared remarks. ""It is startling to think that any country would allow, even unofficially, for a so-called 'no-go zone.' The idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom,"" he said. Jindal also suggested the rise of such no-go zones has contributed to growing anti-Semitism throughout Europe, which has prompted many Jews to emigrate from their home countries. ""How does such evil rise again in democratic countries?"" Jindal asked. ""I believe it is because radical Islamists have been given too wide a berth to establish their own nation within a nation,"" he said. Muslim leaders need to ""condemn anyone who commits these acts of violence, and clearly state that these people are evil and are enemies of Islam,"" he added. The idea of ""no-go zones"" sparked controversy last week when a Fox News commentator raised the prospect of areas in France, Britain, Sweden and Germany where those countries' governments ""don't exercise any sovereignty,"" and which instead are run largely by Muslim immigrants. The commentator also mentioned whole cities ""where non-Muslims simply don't go in,"" in particular the city of Birmingham in the United Kingdom.

""When I heard this, frankly, I choked on my porridge and I thought it must be April Fools' Day. This guy is clearly a complete idiot,"" he said. The Fox commentator later apologized to Birmingham for labeling it a no-go zone, but stood by the idea that such areas exist. Fox News, however, issued a formal apology for the remarks, with host Julie Banderas retracting the comments as ""regrettable errors"" and saying the network ""deeply regret(s) the errors and apologize(s) to any and all who may have taken offense.""

""It is the toughest speech I have read on the whole issue of Islamic radicalism and its destructive, murdering, barbarous ways which are upsetting the entire world,"" Kudlow wrote in an op-ed.

""It's no surprise that Bobby Jindal would go abroad and butcher the facts in an effort to divide people -- this is exactly what we've come to expect from Jindal here at home,"" Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Rebecca Chalif told CNN.

"(CNN)The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks hail from two of the finest craft beer regions in the U.S. Boston is home to Samuel Adams, the largest-selling craft beer company in the country, as well as some smaller, notable breweries like Trillium Brewing and Cambridge Brewing Co. Seattle was one of the key players in starting the microbrew revolution, partly because of its proximity to fresh hops in the nearby Yakima Valley. One of the leaders of that revolution was Elysian Brewing Co., now famous for its creative pumpkin beers and flagship Immortal IPA. Just last week, Elysian announced that Anheuser-Busch bought the company to further expand its craft portfolio. So, for better or worse, you're likely to start seeing much more from this craft beer forefather. In fact, Elysian and Boston's Harpoon Brewing have set up a friendly wager for Super Bowl Sunday: Three kegs of beer from each brewery will be poured in the opposite breweries' taprooms the week after the big game. The loser will be required to fly the flag of the winning team until the beer is gone. In keeping with that friendly competitive spirit, let's break down the roster of these two craft beer cities. The quarterback is the leader of the team and, in many instances, the most recognizable name to viewers. This brew must define what the city is all about and be the No. 1 ""draft"" pick at the local sports bar. XXXXX Stout  -- The Pike Brewing Co.; Seattle, Washington . Just blocks from the iconic Pike Place Market, Pike Brewing is one of the oldest and most respected breweries in Washington. Its XXXXX Stout, much like the Super Bowl, has a fondness for Roman numerals. It's the quintessential Seattle beer with rich chocolate and espresso flavors, because what would Seattle be without its coffee? Harpoon IPA -- Harpoon Brewery; Boston, Massachusetts, and Windsor, Vermont . Since 1993, Harpoon's hoppy pale ale has been a New England staple. This style of beer is right out of the Pacific Northwest playbook, but Harpoon was one of the first to produce an IPA on the East Coast. These brews are among the most widely available from each region, but still great representations of the area. If you're looking to cheer on a particular team but do not live in the Boston or Seattle area, you can still most likely catch one of these brews at your local store. Boston Lager -- Samuel Adams; Boston, Massachusetts . Samuel Adams Boston Lager is the most widely recognized craft beer in the country. It's crisp, refreshing and arguably the most ""patriotic"" beer you can find. Audible Ale -- Redhook Ale Brewery; Woodinville, Washington . While Redhook makes its home in Woodinville, it also has a brew house in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which is about an hour's drive from Boston. This pale ale is fairly low in alcohol, and thus a pleasing session brew, meaning you can drink a few over the course of a game and not get inebriated. Don't call an audible -- stock up on this one. These brews might be stars locally, but they haven't received much national attention ... yet. Their scope is still pretty small, but they are hitting the gym and building a pretty strong following among local craft beer fans. Mass Rising -- Jack's Abby Brewing; Framingham, Massachusetts . Jack's Abby is a unique craft brewer that specializes in lagers. Some craft beer snobs might think lagers are boring, but Jack's Abby gets pretty inventive with the style. One standout is Mass Rising, a double India pale lager that is hopped-up, crisp and drinkable. Tamerlane Brown Porter -- Black Raven Brewing Co.; Redmond, Washington . Black Raven has been producing some of the best brews in the state, and its Tamerlane Brown Porter is an all-out winner. It combines the nutty, malty characteristics of an English brown ale with the coffee flavors of a porter. The Super Bowl calls for times to be bold and take a chance. A little divine intervention doesn't hurt either. Same goes for your beer. Spencer Trappist Ale -- Spencer Brewery; Spencer, Massachusetts . Massachusetts is home to the only Trappist brewery in the United States. The monks of St. Joseph's Abbey brew this Belgian-style ""table beer"" sustainably and consume the fruits of their labors only on Sunday evenings, which is impeccable timing for the big game. Sky Hag IPA -- Airways Brewing Co.; Kent, Washington . Sky Hag is bitter, loaded with West Coast hops and may not be pretty, but it will get you where you want to go. Airways has a number of delicious brews with air travel themes, like Seat Kicker IPA and Pre Flight Pilsner, because founder and brewer Alex Dittmar was a full-time airline employee before starting the brewery.","Seattle and New England are craft beer powerhouses .

"(CNN)The Australian author of the best-selling novel ""The Thorn Birds"" has died. ""It is with great sadness that HarperCollins Books Australia advise(s) that the iconic and much-loved author, Colleen McCullough, passed away on Thursday in hospital on Norfolk Island, aged 77,"" the publisher posted on Facebook. Her 1977 novel ""The Thorn Birds,"" which sold 30 million copies worldwide, was made in to a TV miniseries in 1983, starring Richard Chamberlain, Barbara Stanwyck, Jean Simmons and Christopher Plummer. The generation spanning novel is set in the Australian outback. ""A priest torn between his calling and the lure of a rancher's daughter in this sumptuous epic...resulted in the second highest rated miniseries ever after Roots,"" according to TV Guide. At the time, the book's paperback rights sold for a record setting price of $1.9 million. McCullough was born in Australia, but lived and studied abroad for many years. She was a neurophysiologist and worked at hospitals in Australia and Britain, and for 10 years at Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut. Aside from ""The Thorn Birds,"" McCullough wrote more than ten other novels including the historical series ""The Masters of Rome."" Her most recent novel, ""Bittersweet,"" was published in 2013. She was also featured on an Australian Post postage stamp. ""She was one of the first Australian writers to succeed on the world stage,"" according to HarperCollins Books Australia.

"(CNN)Disney announced Thursday that its newest princess will be Elena of Avalor, a 16-year-old character inspired by ""diverse Latin cultures and folklore."" She'll make her debut on Disney Junior's animated show ""Sofia the First"" next year, which is targeted at children ages 2 to 7. Elena's own eponymous spinoff series is set to premiere in 2016 on Disney Junior, as well as Disney Junior's programming block on the Disney Channel. Aimee Carrero of ABC Family's ""Young & Hungry"" will voice the role.

In fall 2012, Disney faced harsh criticism after a producer of the ""Sofia the First"" series announced that the title character was Latina. Disney Junior executives later clarified that the princess' ethnicity had been misrepresented, adding that ""all our characters come from fantasy lands that may reflect elements of various cultures and ethnicities but none are meant to specifically represent those real world cultures.""

"London (CNN)I found myself talking back to the radio this morning in a way that I've never quite done before. The station was LBC, one of the UK's leading radio stations, and the topic in question was British actor Benedict Cumberbatch's use of the term ""colored"" during his appearance on the ""Tavis Smiley Show"" on PBS in the United States. The uproar that has ensued has left me slightly perplexed. Cumberbatch was discussing with Smiley the inequality of roles for black actors in the UK and the frustrating lack of opportunities for them -- a subject that is close to my heart. In doing so, he mistakenly used an outmoded term to describe his fellow colleagues in their struggle. I am, and have been, offended by the term when it has been used towards me, and I don't ever want to be described by this word -- one that is rooted in an abhorrent period of history in many countries, and has connotations that were intended to offend. It of course later became the politically correct term du jour, before finally being absented from common parlance, for good. But wait! My yelling at the radio this morning comes from a place where I find myself wondering. Why are we choosing to lose the nuances here? Are we more comfortable with obscuring the bigger picture behind an admittedly mistaken use of a word, than we are with receiving the actual message that the sender was trying to offer -- a very necessary message about injustice and inequality from someone who cared enough to voice it? Isn't there a space to explore intent in a person's actions, even when it comes to use of language that can offend? Can our racial debates simply be reduced so easily to black and white, good or bad? My slight connection with Cumberbatch is that we were once Facebook friends. We are loosely connected through industry friends and some of them are of color. So for my part, I see an actor who was on Smiley's important show who was trying to stand in unity with his fellow actors, about an issue that has mostly been highlighted by those of color within the entertainment industry. I am one of those industry members. I have never understood issues of any kind of prejudice and inequality to be anything other than a problem for all of society. The idea that we can relegate certain groups to the margins, stifling any potential they may bring to the mainstream, seems a foolish lack of foresight in understanding that such prejudice harms society as a whole -- not only those relegated. And, in my opinion, to change endemic injustices requires a holistic approach -- one that calls on all areas of society to come together to demand change. So when an actor like Cumberbatch takes on questions of inequality and is not simply pulled up and corrected, but has his whole background and character denigrated for using a word of outdated terminology, in spite of the greater message in his words, are we not responding with the very same prejudice that we have used to label him? Are we not also terrifying others who may wish to speak out on the same issues? Won't they keep quiet for fear they may make a mistake under the pressure of an interview and the importance of the subject and find their message lost? I myself have struggled in interviews to ensure my message is not lost in the split-second use of an incorrect word. The word has too much meaning and history for me as a black woman, but it is possible for others who are nervous and under the pressure of concerns to ""get it right"" to become confused and use the term ""colored"" in place of ""people of color"" when wishing to embrace black and other non-white ethnic groups. It's not correct, but it's possible to make the mistake, with the best intentions of trying to encompass all persuasions who encounter racism but in the end, I feel we all lose out if we dwell on the naïve use of a word (and subsequent apology) and become deaf to a message. We make mistakes. But isn't it time we started to have more nuanced discussions on race -- where heart and intent are taken into account, allowing us to concentrate on the very real battles we face to eliminate the existence of racism from all elements of our world?","Benedict Cumberbatch apologized for calling black actors ""colored"" on U.S. TV .
Amma Asante: I am, and have been, offended by the term when it has been used towards me .
But are we not responding with the same prejudice that we have used to label him, she asks ."
"Apple has elicited a lot of hand-wringing by investors and fans alike lately, even as its chief competition Samsung seems to be prompting nothing but applause. Turns out selling a wider variety of phones and tablets is a good strategy after all. While Apple was on its way to the company's first profit decline in almost a decade during the first three months of the year, Samsung's net profit grew 42 percent in the same period to 7.2 trillion won -- about $6.5 billion U.S. -- from 5 trillion won a year earlier. It was a record-setting quarter for the Korean consumer electronics maker. ""Our business earnings grew from the previous quarter driven by an increase in smartphone sales and decreased marketing expenses,"" Hyun Joon Kim, Samsung's vice president of mobile planning told analysts. In other words, Samsung sold more phones while pumping less money into marketing. Kim further pinned the quarter's success on sales of its flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S3, and its oversized Galaxy Note 2 handset. Research firms underscored the two companies' divergent financial performance with units shipped. ""Samsung shipped almost two times more smartphones and grew nine times faster than Apple during the quarter,"" said Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston in a report digging into the first quarter. Another research firm, Juniper Analytics, estimates Samsung shipped 68 million smartphones during the first quarter, accounting for approximately 34% of the 200 million smartphones sold. Apple in contrast, sold north of 37 million iPhones during the same quarter. The quarter met with the guidance Samsung had earlier provided, but it was all the more impressive because the company pulled it off despite being forced to pay out an estimated $600 million to Apple, and even before it dropped its next-generation smartphone, the S4, (which just went on sale in the United States over the weekend). The S4 is expected to keep the Samsung streak going, and one would think ought to light a fire beneath Apple. Apple has stubbornly resisted offering a lower-priced iPhone, or a handset with a significantly larger screen-size (older, discounted models don't count as a true lower price effort). In the tablet space it has been more willing to experiment, and has had great success with its smaller, and lower priced iPad Mini. But with Samsung on a roll, and showing no signs of letting up on its variety of offerings, Apple may be forced to rethink its strategy. The pressure will be on for Apple to come up with its own plan to expand into new markets, and beyond the premium category that it has dominated for so long. Until it does, you can expect the applause for Samsung to continue.","As Apple sales dip, Samsung continues to climb .

"(CNN)Athlete, marathoner -- and now swimsuit model. Caroline Wozniacki has appeared in Sports Illustrated's famous swimsuit edition this year, becoming the latest tennis player to don a bikini in a shoot for the renown U.S. publication. Her pal, world No. 1 Serena Williams, along with Maria Sharapova and Ana Ivanovic, have featured in the swimsuit edition in the past and the Dane couldn't wait to join them. So much so Wozniacki approached the magazine, not vice versa. ""It's always been a dream of mine (to be in the swimsuit Issue),"" Wozniacki, a former No. 1 like Sharapova and Ivanovic, told the For The Win website Monday in New York. ""I went to the offices of Sports Illustrated quite a few months ago and threw myself out there. 'If you need a model or want one, I'm here.' ""It must have made a pretty good impression. ""Because I travel the world so much and play all over the place and spend so much time over here, the issue is a huge deal for me and my family. I think because I'm in it this year, Denmark is going crazy about it this year and that's fun to see."" Wozniacki posted pictures of the shoot on Twitter -- and one of her other friends on the tour, Victoria Azarenka, was impressed, calling the photos ""stunning."" The magazine hit the newsstands this week. Azarenka dumped the Dane out of the Australian Open -- this season's first grand slam -- in straight sets in the second round. While Wozniacki waits for her first grand slam title, her inclusion in the swimsuit edition is likely to do no harm to her off court profile. Last September she did reach the U.S. Open final in New York -- losing to Williams -- and returned to the Big Apple a few months later to take part in the New York City Marathon.","Caroline Wozniacki appears in SI's swmsuit edition .

"(CNN)Beneath the snow-capped peaks of St Moritz a group of hardy souls are ditching their skis, and jumping on a horse. Below the pistes, it's time for snow polo. Winter in the Swiss resort sees a group of dedicated players transform a frozen lake into a battlefield of hooves and mallets. ""We couldn't wait until summer came again, so we had to be creative,"" explains Reto Gaudenzi, who organizes the tournament. And if sending a bunch of horses onto a frozen lake sounds like a recipe for disaster, Gaundezi points out: ""Horses on snow are not new."" St Moritz has been doing this for a while. Its annual snow polo event began in 1985 and, since 1907, a series of horse races dubbed the ""White Turf"" have been staged each February, involving not just hockeys but ""skijorers"" who ride behind their horse, on skis. ""The question is how to play sport on the lake, with the abrupt motion that polo has,"" continues Gaudenzi. ""The technical possibilities have changed dramatically. Thirty years ago we had a little Bombardier machine to try to make a field. Now we have sophisticated machinery to make the surface. Better surface, better polo -- that is the secret of polo. ""We create the field by mixing the ice with layers of prepared snow, so it doesn't get slippery. Then, we invented a shoe for the horse so the snow doesn't pile up in the hoof."" That is achieved thanks to a rubber pad between the shoe and the hoof, which dislodges snow. Modern snow polo horseshoes also use a lip at the toe, coupled with cleats at the heel, to give horses the traction to compete safely. In another safety move, the game's periods -- or chukkas -- are shorter. Playing polo in the rarefied St Moritz air is more tiring for horses (and humans) than life at sea level. ""Snow polo is very different,"" says Rommy Gianni, captain one of the teams at this year's event, in late January and early February. ""The game is a bit slower -- there is less control of the ball since you're playing on snow, it's very difficult to have control -- but it's faster mentally. ""The game can change from one second to another in a faster way compared to playing on grass. It's slower, but somehow more difficult to play."" The high-visibility orange ball helps to slow the game, and also makes it trickier, being softer and larger than a standard polo ball. ""Some of the best players in the world get along with it -- some don't,"" says Gaudenzi. ""You have to have a different swing. If you hit it at full strength, it has a worse effect. Like soccer, you have to have the feeling for the ball, it's more sophisticated. ""It's funny to see some very good players who don't get along with it. In 30 years, we've found out who is good and who is not so good... and we invite the good guys."" That is a matter of opinion. Somewhat bizarrely, for a sport quite this exclusive, rival snow polo events face off each February -- both calling themselves the World Cup. St Moritz bills itself a World Cup and proudly maintains it is the original, and best. But, over in Tianjin, China, organizers are preparing to host a Snow Polo World Cup of their own. The Chinese one is backed by the Federation of International Polo (FIP), the sport's world governing body. ""We feel it is really the ultimate world championship,"" says Dr Richard T Caleel, who stood down as FIP president in late 2014. ""All of the teams [in Tianjin] are national teams, they do actually represent their countries, the players all have to be citizens of that country. That's a twist to most of the other tournaments, where teams are frequently mixed."" Dr Caleel is correct that in St Moritz, teams are usually a mix of nationalities backed by a major sponsor. For instance, Gianni's team will feature the Italian alongside a German and two Argentinian pros. Gianni, making his St Moritz debut after 10 years playing snow polo, is convinced he is heading to the toughest tournament in the world. ""The most competitive event on snow, from what I've heard and seen, is St Moritz,"" he insists. And organizer Gaudenzi, naturally, won't hear of any competition for snow polo's crown. ""It's a jungle out there,"" he admits, with a laugh. ""Everybody does more or less what they want. But they call St Moritz the Wimbledon of snow polo in the newspapers here. It's the best tournament in the world. ""Optically, it's unbelievable. You're at 1,800 meters (5,905 feet) on a frozen lake, playing polo in the snow with a blue sky. It's a very unique thing. ""And the food is fantastic. We have world-class chefs, the champagne is flowing, the vodka -- no caviar, the lake is frozen so we can't get the fish out,"" he jokes. ""If you bring caviar, you'll make some friends."" You'll be paying upwards of $500 to get at the chefs and champagne, who are there to serve the many VIPs who descend on St Moritz each year. But, as Gaudenzi points out, admission to the lakeside grandstand is free. ""You go there, you buy your sausage, you drink your beer, you watch snow polo,"" he instructs. ""You have the snow, the cold, the blue sky, the mountains -- the horses, you see the steam -- it's high-class polo. It's the best tournament in the world.""","Snow and ice are no obstacle as St Moritz hosts major equestrian events each winter .

"(CNN)At the 1994 U.S. Open, John McEnroe said he would commentate on his head if Jan Siemerink won a fourth-set tiebreak after falling behind 6-0 to fellow Dutchman Richard Krajicek. Guess what? It happened. Siemerink claimed the next eight points and McEnroe did as he promised in a later match at the season's final major. No commentators were believed to have said something similar when Stan Wawrinka trailed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 5-0 and 6-2 in a fourth-set tiebreak Monday at the Australian Open -- and lucky for them. Just like Siemerink, Wawrinka did the almost unthinkable and pulled off a great escape. The defending champion at the year's opening grand slam saved five set points in the tiebreak to close out the encounter against the Spaniard 7-6 (2) 6-4 4-6 7-6 (8) and advance to the quarterfinals. ""Losing 5-0 was a bad start to the tiebreak,"" Wawrinka, upset by Garcia-Lopez at the 2014 French Open, told reporters. ""At 6-2 I knew it was close to come back because I had the wind with me. ""I had to focus on every point. I knew if I was going to come back (to) 6-5, (he) was going to get nervous. Just focused point after point."" Wawrinka is flying the Swiss flag after Roger Federer's surprising loss to Andreas Seppi in the third round and the world No. 4 will have to maintain, or increase, his level if he is to continue his winning streak at Melbourne Park. Wawrinka's quarterfinal opponent, Kei Nishikori, beat the 29-year-old in the last eight in September en route to making the final at the U.S. Open. ""I'm happy the way I'm playing so far,"" Wawrinka said. ""I'm ready for the tournament. My game is there. I didn't spend too much energy on the court since one week. ""I'm happy to get the chance to play one more quarterfinal."" Nishikori did something rare later Monday on Australia Day when he downed David Ferrer 6-3 6-3 6-3. Only Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic had beaten the Spaniard -- one of the game's top competitors -- in straight sets at a hard-court or clay-court major since the beginning of 2011. It was also the first time Nishikori defeated Ferrer in straight sets, his previous six victories all going the distance. World No. 1 Djokovic, going for a fifth Australian Open title, will take on Canada's Milos Raonic in the quarterfinals. Djokovic overcame Gilles Muller in straight sets. Raonic, meanwhile, eliminated Feliciano Lopez in five sets. Lopez saved match points in two encounters earlier in the fortnight and saved another versus Raonic in the fourth set. But Raonic took the fifth 6-3 to prevent a rare hat-trick. Another early wobble for Serena . For the third straight match, women's top-seed Serena Williams survived an early wobble to progress. She saved three set points in the first set against Vera Zvonareva, lost the first set against Elina Svitolina and then lost the first set to Garbine Muguruza -- her conqueror at the French Open -- on Monday. But Williams upped her game despite dealing with a cough and got a bit of luck in the third set to oust the big, flat-hitting 24th-seed 2-6 6-3 6-2 in the fourth round. ""I've been playing for a long time,"" Williams, bidding for a 19th major but first in Australia in five years, told reporters. ""When I have to go up a level, I have to. ""I can't afford to stay at the same level or I will be where I was at the French Open. I definitely didn't want to be there without at least trying to give 1000%."" Still the match might have turned out differently had Muguruza not missed a routine volley on break point when leading 1-0 in the third. ""I knew that if I won this game, I would have more chances to win the third set, because (to) break her serve, it's difficult,"" said Muguruza. ""I wanted to use that opportunity, but I couldn't."" Williams returned to the Rod Laver Arena later on Monday, rooting on older sister Venus. And she left in good spirits, since Venus Williams upset sixth-seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-3 2-6 6-1 to make a first grand slam quarterfinal in five years. Venus Williams, too, hadn't beaten a top-10 player at a major since the 2010 U.S. Open. ""She really had answers for everything today,"" said Radwanska. When Victoria Azarenka upset Caroline Wozniacki in the second round, most would have expected Serena Williams to face the two-time Australian Open winner in the quarterfinals. But Dominika Cibulkova didn't read the script. The 2013 finalist defeated Azarenka 6-2 3-6 6-3. Madison Keys -- who sent Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova packing -- reached her first grand slam quarterfinal by beating compatriot Madison Brengle 6-2 6-4.","Stan Wawrinka drops his first set at the Australian Open .

"There's fresh evidence that American teenagers may be growing weary of Facebook. They don't like the fact that their parents, grandparents and other adults are also there, diluting Facebook's ""cool"" factor. They complain about their friends'  oversharing, and about too much ""drama"" on the site. And they're increasingly flocking to other social platforms, such as Twitter. These are some of the findings of a new Pew Research Center survey of U.S. teens' social media use. Released Tuesday, the survey finds that teens are sharing more personal information on social media, but are also taking a variety of steps to manage their privacy online. But it was the Facebook stuff that generated the most headlines. According to Pew, focus-group discussions with teens revealed ""waning enthusiasm"" for Facebook for the reasons cited, including feeling ""drained by the 'drama' that they described as happening frequently"" on the site. ""The stress of needing to manage their reputation on Facebook also contributes to the lack of enthusiasm,"" the survey said. The Pew survey found that 24% of online teens now use Twitter, up from 16% in 2011. Other social platforms such as Tumblr, Instagram (which is owned by Facebook), YouTube and Snapchat also have seen big growth among young users in the past year. ""Those teens who used sites like Twitter and Instagram reported feeling like they could better express themselves on these platforms, where they felt freed from the social expectations and constraints of Facebook,"" the Pew survey said. ""Nevertheless, the site is still where a large amount of socializing takes place, and teens feel they need to stay on Facebook in order to not miss out."" Facebook has 1.1 billion users worldwide and remains the most popular social network among U.S. teens. A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment specifically Wednesday on the Pew report but pointed to statements by CFO David Ebersman in a recent conference call about quarterly earnings, in which he emphasized Facebook's popularity among users under 25. ""We continue to have really high penetration rates among that age group, both in the U.S. and globally, and ... younger users remain among the most active and engaged users,"" Ebersman said. ""Younger users are extremely active users of Instagram as well."" Facebook executives maintain that teen use of their social network has remained steady. They argue that Facebook is not losing users to other platforms -- instead, they say, more users are visiting other social media sites in addition to Facebook. ""The urban legend (that Facebook is losing younger users) flows more often than not from surveys people have done of younger users that indicate that they're using other social services ... much of the concern stems from the assumption that this is a zero-sum game, and that's not how we see it,"" Ebersman said. ""We think the overall amount of time spent on services that enable you to connect and share is growing and will continue to grow."" Jeff Hancock, a professor of communication at Cornell University and a frequent social media analyst, mostly agrees. ""Facebook's attraction to youth is based in part on being connected, but also on being an 'ingroup' and 'cool' thing. To the degree that the cool of Facebook wears off, we should see some migration of teens to other platforms,"" he said. ""People are unlikely to fully leave Facebook but simply to diversify their tools for accomplishing social interaction.

"(CNN)Oscar-nominated star Benedict Cumberbatch has apologized for referring to black actors as ""colored"" on a U.S. talk show. The ""12 Years a Slave"" actor said he was an ""idiot"" and ""devastated"" at his choice of words during an interview with PBS' Tavis Smiley about the lack of diversity in the British film industry. Cumberbatch, 38, told Smiley: ""I think as far as colored actors go, it gets really difficult in the UK, and I think a lot of my friends have had more opportunities here [in the U.S.] than in the UK, and that's something that needs to change."" His comments were criticized by some observers on Twitter as being insensitive and out of touch. One user called Sonya Thomas asked: ""Benedict Cumberbatch used the term 'coloured' to describe black actors. What year are we in?"" But Smiley, who is black, defended the ""Sherlock"" star on Monday, tweeting: ""Those who saw Benedict Cumberbatch on @PBS, know he feels persons of color are underrepresented in #Hollywood."" The actor, who appeared on Smiley's show to discuss his Oscar-nominated role in ""The Imitation Game,"" praised the efforts of Lenny Henry, a black British actor and comedian who has launched a campaign to ensure more ethnic minorities are employed in the UK media. ""Something's gone wrong -- we're not being representative enough in our culture of different races, and that really does need to step up a pace,"" Cumberbatch said. ""It's clear when you see certain migratory patterns that there are more opportunities here than there are in the UK."" Cumberbatch issued the following statement to People magazine on Monday: ""I'm devastated to have caused offense by using this outmoded terminology. I offer my sincere apologies. I make no excuse for my being an idiot and know the damage is done. ""I can only hope this incident will highlight the need for correct usage of terminology that is accurate and inoffensive. The most shaming aspect of this for me is that I was talking about racial inequality in the performing arts in the U.K. and the need for rapid improvements in our industry when I used the term. ""I feel the complete fool I am and while I am sorry to have offended people and to learn from my mistakes in such a public manner please be assured I have. I apologize again to anyone who I offended for this thoughtless use of inappropriate language about an issue which affects friends of mine and which I care about deeply."" Read: Opinion: Cumberbatch misspoke -- now let's get over it and fight real prejudice . Anti-racism campaigners in the UK lamented Cumberbatch's use of the word as ""outdated"" but praised the actor for highlighting ""a very important issue within the entertainment industry and within society."" ""The lack of representation of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds within certain industries in the UK is an issue which needs addressing, and we are pleased that Benedict has spoken out in support of more appropriate representation and of the views of actors and campaigners like Lenny Henry,"" a spokesperson from Show Racism the Red Card told CNN. ""In doing so, he has also inadvertently highlighted the issue of appropriate terminology and the evolution of language. Show Racism the Red Card feel that the term 'coloured' is now outdated and has the potential to cause offence due to the connotations associated with the term and its historical usage."" ""Appropriate terminology differs from country to country; for example, we know that in some countries the term 'coloured' is still widely used, and that in the US the term 'people of colour' is quite common.""

"The Maker Faire is a festival spun out of the maker movement that brings together science, crafting, robots, steampunk, drones and Legos. Lots of Legos. It's a grassroots celebration of DIY, or the do-it-yourself culture that has helped boost Etsy, Pinterest and other sites. And in the Faire's eighth year, organizers are having increasing success packaging and exporting the unique Maker Faire brand around the world. The original Bay Area event was held last weekend in San Mateo, California, and organizers estimate it drew more than 120,000 people. For the past five years, Maker Media has also run an official Maker Faire in New York, on the grounds of the old World's Fair in Queens. The movement also is gaining popularity internationally, so Maker Faire is planning a large October event in Rome, home of Arduino founder Massimo Banzi. But in true maker spirit, most of the satellite events are homegrown. There will be more than 120 smaller Maker Faires put on in communities around the world in 2013, up from just 60 last year. While Maker Media doesn't directly organize these smaller events, it does provide locals with connections and a playbook on how to put on their own Maker Faire-branded events. The colorful events are part carnival, part theme park, part crafts festival and part science museum. They're a big attraction for older hobbyists, younger makers and crafters, and families who want to expose their kids to the creative side of science and engineering and get them more involved with hands-on projects. ""It's almost sort of the new Disneyland, where people get to participate in inventing and creating the future versus just watching it and walking through it,"" said Sherry Huss, Maker Media vice president and co-founder of the Maker Faire. Some of the event's most popular attractions were at the Bay Area festival this past weekend, including a Mentos and Coke demonstration, large sculptures originally made for the Burning Man gathering, and the car-smashing Life-Size Mousetrap, which is a giant Rube Goldberg device. Smaller activities like lock-picking and soldering lessons are also big hits. But the fastest-growing categories at Maker Faires are Arduino (a tiny electronic controller), the single-board computer Raspberry Pi, 3-D printing and personal fabrication, according to Huss. The Fiesta Hall was kept dark for light-centric displays like a giant Tetris game, a glowing abstract forest, and the ArcAttack musical performance group, which dazzled the crowd with its Tesla coils. The event had a heavy focus on the local community and featured booths for Bay Area groups devoted to Legos, robotics, model tanks, and even building R2-D2 robots from ""Star Wars."" In the Expo Hall, the makers gave talks and small companies sold their wares for crafters and makers. There were around 1,000 makers at this year's Bay Area event. Some 150 of them were kids, a 60% increase from the previous year. Organizers think a key part of getting children more engaged in science is exposing them to these types of interactive activities. Their parents seem to agree. ""I think it's part nostalgic,"" said Huss. ""As parents are aging they remember great experiences with their grandparents, and I think they're probably trying to figure out how to make this happen to their own families, especially as schools get further and further away from hands-on activities."" Even the youngest kids were making things at the festival. At the Maker Camp tables, children and adults made crafts like duct-tape wallets. Nearby, a hill covered with used cardboard, tape, scissors and other supplies was a hotbed of imagination for kids built elaborate forts and costumes. Maker Faire attendees are a faithful bunch, often returning year after year to their local events. Katherine Becvar, decked out in a purple velvet coat, cat-eye glasses and fanciful hat at the Bay Area fair, sells bags at Burning Man and all the major craft and maker shows. But she said the Maker Faire is her favorite because it combines a little bit of everything.","The 2013 Bay Area Maker Faire took place last weekend in San Mateo, California .

"(CNN)It matters that Disney has chosen to make its newest princess Hispanic. Princess Elena of Avalor, who will debut next year on Disney Junior's ""Sofia the First,"" according to the company, appears to represent a commitment to diversity -- which also happens to be a smart business strategy in a country with a burgeoning Latino population. But most importantly, Elena -- a princess meant to reflect ""diverse Latin cultures and folklore,"" says Disney -- will offer young Latina girls an opportunity to see themselves in the media that they consume. Just like other American girls. And they will see a lot of her: Elena will have her own animated series later in 2016, and will be voiced by the Dominican-born actress Aimee Carrero, according to a Disney press release. In other words: Move over Cinderella, there is a new princesa in town. From Sleeping Beauty to Snow White, the Disney princesses are a staple of pop culture -- fantasy heroines iconic to generations of young girls.  Disney has introduced with great fanfare ethnically diverse princesses before: the Asian princess (Mulan), a Native-American princess (Pocahontas), a Middle Eastern princess (Jasmine), and an African-American princess (Tiana). And they are no longer primarily known for their ethnicity. They are simply seen as Disney princesses . The same will likely be true of Elena.  What's crucial, is that all young Disney fans can feel included, visible, and relevant through a multicultural lineup of heroines.  By seeing themselves throughout our culture, the next generation of Latinas will feel more fully part of American society. Besides, it couldn't hurt for young Latinas have a positive role model, even if she is a fictional character.  A 2012 study by the National Hispanic Media Coalition found that TV shows and films often contributed to the public's negative perception of Latinos.  In fact, the Coalition found that the top three ways that non-Latinos viewed Latinos in the media were as criminals, gardeners and maids. Elena also reflects an important recognition by Disney of the power of the Latino consumer market.  Last year, the Nielsen Company estimated that U.S. Hispanics have a spending power of $1.4 trillion, and companies like Ford, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart have all targeted Hispanic customers. Disney already markets a line of quinceñera dresses, so Elena could be seen as a logical extension of their brand.  It cannot be lost on Disney that its rival Nickelodeon has enjoyed phenomenal TV and merchandising success with their Latina character Dora the Explorer. Sure, some critics have expressed reservations about Elena, noting that she is not getting her own movie like the other princesses, and that she is on Disney Junior channel, not the more popular Disney Channel.  And Disney generated controversy when it debuted ""Sofia the First"" in 2013.  Sofia was initially reported to be the first Latina princess, and then the company walked back on comments by a producer and declared that Sofia was not Latina after all. But I think Disney should be applauded for trying again.  The enormous reach of the company will ensure that millions of viewers are exposed to an uplifting Latina character.  Consider Elena's series will be rolled out in 25 languages on Disney Junior channels, in 154 countries around the world.  That's a lot of tiaras. It is welcome news that Disney is finally introducing a princess that looks like thousands of little Hispanic girls.  Here's hoping that someday Elena will be seen not just as a Latina princess, but as a character as American as Mickey Mouse.","Raul Reyes: Disney announced new Latina princess, which is laudable, likely profitable in America with growing Hispanic population .

"The nation's top tax collector resigned Wednesday amid controversy over Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups that applied for federal tax-exempt status. The official, acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, was aware employees were targeting conservative groups in May 2012, according to the agency. But Miller, then the agency's deputy commissioner, didn't tell Congress about it when he testified before an oversight committee in July -- despite being questioned on the issue. He was named acting commissioner in November. An administration official told CNN on Thursday that Obama will appoint a new acting commissioner this week. Announcing the resignation to reporters Wednesday, President Barack Obama said the agency's misconduct was ""inexcusable."" Read the IRS IG report . ""Americans have a right to be angry about it, and I'm angry about it,"" Obama said. ""It should not matter what political stripe you're from. The fact of the matter is, the IRS has to operate with absolute integrity,"" the president said. Obama pledged to work ""hand in hand"" with Congress as it investigates the matter, and vowed new safeguards will be put in place at the IRS so that ""this doesn't happen again."" Despite his resignation, Miller is expected to testify Friday at a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee, according to a source familiar with the proceedings. Read the resignation letter . In an internal message to IRS employees obtained by CNN, Miller said he would be stepping down as commissioner in early June. ""This has been an incredibly difficult time for the IRS given the events of the past few days, and there is a strong and  immediate need to restore public trust in the nation's tax agency,"" Miller wrote. Opinion: With IRS defanged, politics can run rampant . 'Rogue' employees . News of Miller's resignation followed revelations that the IRS has identified two ""rogue"" employees in the agency's Cincinnati office as being principally responsible for the ""overly aggressive"" handling of requests by conservative groups for tax-exempt status, a congressional source told CNN. Miller said the staffers have already been disciplined, according to another source familiar with Miller's discussions with congressional investigators. The second source said Miller emphasized that the problem with IRS handling of tax-exempt status for tea party groups was not limited to these two employees. Miller met with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana on Tuesday to discuss an appearance before Congress. Asked Wednesday in a Senate hallway about his meeting with Miller, Baucus told CNN, ""I did not learn as much from the meeting as I would have liked."" ""I told him that it was in his best interest to be totally cooperative -- that it's often the cover-up that causes more problems than the original malfeasance,"" the senator said. ""And just to be totally straight with me and everybody, and he said he would."" Meanwhile, Republican congressional leaders on Wednesday accused Obama's administration of potentially criminal behavior in the handling of requests for tax-exempt status from conservative groups. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell suggested criminal behavior had occurred, saying that the ""very serious"" allegations involve ""an effort to bring the power of the federal government to bear on those the administration disagreed with in the middle of a heated national election."" ""It actually could be, could be criminal and we are determined to get the answers,"" McConnell said. House Speaker John Boehner was more definitive. ""My question is, who's going to jail over this scandal?"" he asked. Boehner told reporters that ""clearly someone violated the law"" in what an IRS inspector general's report described as delayed processing of applications by groups associated with the political right wing. Opinion: The real risk of the IRS scandal . Multiple investigations . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who ordered a criminal investigation into the situation, said Wednesday at a congressional hearing that investigators will look at the conduct of IRS offices nationwide. ""The facts will take us where ever they take us,"" he said. Holder said the investigation will also examine whether IRS officials lied to Congress about the singling out of conservative groups. While the allegations originated in the Cincinnati office, the Justice Department inquiry is based out of Washington, Holder said. The comments came as all 45 Senate Republicans sent the White House a letter that called for the administration to ""comply with all requests related to congressional inquiries without any delay"" involving the controversy. The letter called the scandal ""yet another completely inexcusable attempt to chill the speech of political opponents and those who would question their government, consistent with a broader pattern of intimidation by arms of your administration to silence political dissent."" The clearly coordinated attacks were part of a GOP effort to increase pressure on the Obama administration over the controversy, one of three potential scandals that has the White House on the defensive less than four months into the president's second term. According to the report by the agency's inspector general released Tuesday, the IRS developed and followed a faulty policy to determine whether the applicants were engaged in political activities, which would disqualify the groups from receiving tax-exempt status. The controversial move began in early 2010 and continued for more than 18 months, the report said, declaring that ""the IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention."" IRS officials, according to the report, did not consult anyone beyond the agency about the development of the additional screening criteria. They believed that the criteria they came up with were a screening shortcut meant to help with the influx of applications, the report said. Will the scandal affect 2014 elections? The controversial actions began after the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case that greatly expanded the ability of corporations, unions and other organizations to participate in election spending, though not through direct contributions to candidates or parties. After the ruling, the number of politically oriented groups seeking tax exempt status as social welfare organizations under section 501 (c) (4) of the federal tax code increased greatly at a time when the federal government, including the IRS, was dealing with austerity measures that reduced or stagnated personnel and resources. The IRS' top watchdog found that the criteria used to flag potential political applications resulted in substantial delays and the request of unnecessary information from the groups. 'Be On the Look Out' Among the criteria used by IRS officials to flag applications was a ""Be On the Look Out"" list, which was discontinued in 2012, according to the report. The criteria included: . -- Whether ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriots"" or ""9/12 Project"" was referenced in the case file. -- Whether the issues outlined in the application included government spending, government debt or taxes. -- Whether there was advocating or lobbying to ""make America a better place to live."" -- Whether a statement in the case file criticized how the country is being run. -- Whether it advocated education about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The investigation by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration was initiated after congressional complaints began to surface in the media in 2012 that the IRS was targeting conservative groups and holding up applications. Obama struggles with rocky start to second term . ""Whether the inappropriate criterion was shorthand for all potential political cases or not, developing and using criteria that focuses on organization names and policy positions instead of the activities permitted under the Treasury regulations does not promote public confidence that tax-exempt laws are being adhered to impartially,"" the report said. The IRS welcomed the report, saying that it agreed that aspects of its original approach in handling the influx of tax-exempt applications was inappropriate. ""The IRS is required by law to determine if organizations are engaging in a legally permissible level of political activity. Centralizing these cases was necessary to achieve consistent treatment,"" it said in a statement. Inefficient management . In a written response included in the report, the IRS commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division said there was no criminal behavior behind the actions of the agents, but rather inefficient management. IRS in the spotlight: What's a 501(c)(4)? ""We believe the front-line career employees that made the decisions acted out of a desire for efficiency and not out of any political and partisan viewpoint,"" the commissioner wrote. The report's findings indicate that of the 298 cases reviewed by the IRS inspector general as potential political cases not eligible for tax exempt status: 72 contained the name ""tea party,"" 11 contained ""9/12"" and 13 contained the word ""patriots,"" according to the report. There were 202 cases that did not contain any such reference. Of those applications still open for review, 160 cases were open from 206 days to more than three years -- through two election cycles. Among the recommendations made by the Treasury inspector general: The IRS must better document reasons why applications are chosen for review, develop a process to track requests for assistance, develop and provide training to employees before each election cycle and immediately resolve outstanding cases. The report also called on Treasury to develop guidelines to explain social welfare activity -- the primary factor in obtaining tax-exempt status.","The president will appoint a new acting commissioner this week, a source says .

"At least 120 people were killed and 270 others wounded on Friday when two suicide bombers blew themselves up and gunmen opened fire on a Muslim congregation at Friday prayers in the central mosque in northern Nigeria's largest city of Kano, a rescue official said. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the toll could rise, as some of the wounded were in critical condition and may not survive. A third bomb exploded outside the mosque among a crowd of worshipers. The attacks come two weeks after the emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, one of Nigeria's most influential monarchs, called for self-defense, urging people to procure arms and fight Islamist militant group Boko Haram‎, which has a significant presence in the area. The emir made the call at the same mosque where Friday's attack occurred. Although there was no immediate claim of responsibility, Boko Haram is the main suspect. Many believe the attacks were reprisals for the emir's call to arms against the terror group. A CNN reporter at the morgue of the Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital -- one of two hospitals treating victims of the attacks -- counted 94 bodies and was told by a health professional involved in collecting bodies that 38 bodies already had been identified and taken by relations for burial. ""We have around 140 dead bodies brought from the mosque and more than 160 being treated for various injuries,"" the health professional said, asking not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on casualties. ""This is only for this hospital. Other corpses and wounded victims have been taken to Nassarawa Specialist Hospital,"" he said. At Nassarawa Specialist Hospital, a rescue worker said the facility had received scores of injured and dead. ""We brought in more than 150 people injured in the attack at the mosque along with dozens of dead bodies,"" the rescue worker said. Hundreds of relations have thronged the morgues and emergency units of the two hospitals to identify their dead relations and tend for those wounded, with doctors and nurses overstretched by the huge number of casualties. At the Murtala Mohammed hospital, relatives were taking turns entering the morgue in groups to identify loved ones killed in the attacks, then to take bodies for burial after documentation by morgue attendants. National police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu said the two bombers detonated explosives strapped to their bodies within short intervals while gunmen opened fire on worshipers who were trying to escape. At least three men, wearing explosives and armed with AK-47s, arrived in a Toyota Sienna van and opened fire on people fleeing the mosque, Kano Deputy Police Commissioner Sanusi N. Lemo told reporters. An irate mob pursued the gunmen who had opened fire on worshipers, and people in the mob killed the gunmen, Ojukwu and witnesses said. ""The fact that the people pursued and killed the gunmen with bare hands shows the people have heeded to the call of the emir to fight back,"" said resident Sani Akarami. The emir, who had urged resistance against Boko Haram, was not at the mosque when the attack took place.  He is in Saudi Arabia on a pilgrimage, sources close to the emir said. If Boko Haram is found to be responsible for these latest attacks it would be the second worst attack on Kano by the militants. On January 20, 2012 at least 185 people were killed and scores injured in coordinated bomb and shooting attacks on security formations in the city by Boko Haram gunmen. Kano is one of the areas where Boko Haram has fought an anti-government campaign to institute Sharia, or Islamic law. Attacks attributed to the group in Kano include a wave of bombings that killed 180 people in one day in 2012 and a suicide bombing that killed six people, including three police officers, at a gas station this month. Boko Haram, which means ""Western education is a sin,"" still is believed to be holding more than 200 girls it abducted in April from a school in Chibok, Borno state. Also this month, Boko Haram's leader said the girls had been converted to Islam and married off, and he denied the government's claim that it had reached a ceasefire agreement with the group. President Goodluck Jonathan extended his condolences to the victims of the mosque attack and directed officials to conduct a full-scale investigation, Nigerian state broadcaster NTA.","Reporter counts 94 bodies at one hospital .

"(CNN)Kenya has stepped up its efforts to transform 40,000 acres of land into a wind farm, in a bid to meet growing demand for electricity. The 300 MW Lake Turkana Wind Power Project, which is being developed in the country's North-East, hopes to produce 20% of the country's current installed electricity generating capacity when it comes online in 2016. The $694 million project achieved full financial close in December 2014, making it the largest private investment in Kenyan history. ""The success of this project, even though it has taken a long time to become successful, will inspire confidence in investors,"" says William Macpherson, sub-Saharan African energy analyst at African Energy Consultancy. ""It's a renewable plant -- which is harder to get right than other power plants -- and that it looks like it will be online relatively soon shows the government has got its priorities right."" The project is one part of the country's ambitious project to add 5,000 MW of power onto the grid in the next three years. An international consortium of lenders and producers, which includes the African Development Bank, British company Aldwych International and Standard Bank, is aiming to install 365 wind turbines. The 52-meter blade span windmills will take advantage of high winds in the remote area. These breezy conditions are set to cause a jobs windfall. Over the 32 months when the hardware will be installed and new roads built, the project will employ as many as 2,500 people on a temporary basis. Once the wind farm is up and running, 200 people will be employed at the site on a full-time basis throughout the operating period. And such confidence in Kenya's power sector was badly needed after disappointments elsewhere. The Dongo Kundu power plant near Mombasa has suffered long delays after the procurement process failed to produce a viable partner for the government, who wanted to build the Liquified Natural Gas facility in just 18 months. ""If all goes well with the Lake Turkana project, as we expect, it will relieve some of the pressure on the country's energy targets,"" explains Macpherson. Power shortages . The Turkana investment, which is expected to generate $150 million a year in foreign currency savings to Kenya, could have an impact on houses and businesses that are forced to use diesel generators during power black outs. Indeed, in early January, a transmission line failure left over half the country without power for four hours. According to Kenya Power, the country's main electricity transmission company, there were three widespread interruptions of power affecting 75% of the country in 2014. ""In the first month of 2015, we saw approximately nine interruptions per 1,000 customers in one month at the household level,"" explains Benson Muriithi, general manager of Network Management at Kenya Power. ""The plan is to bring that down to two interruptions per 1,000 customers by 2016 or 2017."" State-owned power company KenGen produces approximately 80% of electricity consumed in Kenya, and of that, 65% comes from hydro-power sources. It is KenGen which provides the power to Kenya Power. ""While blackouts in Nairobi are not so frequent as they once were, there is still an issue with electricity supply,"" says Macpherson. ""The government will want to move away from reliance on hydro as rainfall patterns are unreliable in the region."" And as demand for electricity grows, that issue is not going away. Electricity consumption grew by 9% between 2010 and 2011, according to the Institute of Economic Affairs and some estimates say demand will grow by a further 12% by 2030. As well as adding to electricity supply, some businesses will also be hoping the Lake Turkana Wind Power Project contributes to a decrease in power bills. According to the Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries, Kenya Power will buy the power produced at the Turkana Wind Farm at a fixed price over 20 years. Regional powerhouse . But it's not just the east African country investing in renewable energy. According to EcoMENA, Morocco's Ministry of Energy is planning a $13 billion expansion of wind, solar and hydroelectric power generation projects as part of the country's goal to make renewables 42% of the energy mix by 2020. Ghana, meanwhile, is constructing the world's fourth largest solar farm. The Nzema project, in the country's Western Region, will have an installed capacity of 155MWp when it becomes operational later this year. While these projects will help build energy supply on the continent, the International Energy Agency has said sub-Saharan Africa needs to invest $300 billion in order to achieve universal electricity access by 2030. Once up and running, the Turkana Wind Power Project will have the largest amount of wind turbines on the continent, even more than the 300MW Tarfaya wind farm in Morocco, which is currently Africa's biggest wind farm with 131 turbines. It will also be larger than Ashegoda power generating complex in neighboring Ethiopia, which opened in October 2013. Construction is set to begin early 2015, but if the Lake Turkana Wind Power Project does what it's supposed to then Kenyans could be in for fewer blackouts and a more connected future. ""We can expect the Lake Turkana Wind Power project to bring change gradually,"" says Kenya Power's Muriithi. ""As demand for electricity grows, we will see electricity generated from wind turbines play a more important role in Kenya's and reduce power costs in the country.""

"The history of beer in the United States is a rich one dating back to the colonies, when soldiers were paid in spruce beer and cider. From there beer weathered a Revolution, Prohibition and a right turn at Albuquerque before positively exploding with deregulation of the industry through the early 1980s. Ever since, Americans have been sampling, celebrating and sophisticating the unofficial national beverage in ways previously unimaginable, and it seems nearly every town's gotten into the act. But not all cities are carbonated equal. Some have begun to take beer personally, innovating its craft and consumption and throwing festivals to honor the finest ales and lagers -- creating a blueprint for the rest of the country to follow. Still others have been doing this all along. This is the story of those towns, the top eight cities in America for beer explorers. We've scored each out of 10 for history, breweries, bars and events, and would like to think every one of you will read the whole piece quietly, captions and all, nodding sagely as the indisputable truth of every line hits home. But, this is the Internet and if there's one place where froth belongs besides the top of your pint of ale, it's the comment box below. Feel free. 1. Portland, Oregon . History: 6Breweries: 10Bars: 10Events: 7 . Portland boasts more breweries (52) than any city in the world. It's also America's largest craft brewing market, with 69 breweries in the greater metro area, owing to state sales regulations that favor consumer tastes over discounts and kickbacks, allowing small brewers to compete with mass marketers. But the Rose City isn't just about quantity. PDX is where you'll find Hopworks Urban Brewery, Alameda Brewing Company, Cascade Brewing, and family-owned Hair Of The Dog, all nationally renowned for their care and creativity. Fairs like The Oregon Brewer's Festival, the Portland International Beer Festival, and Portland Beer Week -- America's first organic beer festival -- ensure that beer spirit in the city runs high all year, while Biketobeerfest celebrates two things exalted by the region: bikes and beer. Portland is also home to five of Draft magazine's top 100 craft bars -- Saraveza Bottle Shop & Pasty Tavern, Horse Brass Pub, Apex, Bailey's Tap Room, and Belmont Station. Top draws: Hopworks Urban Crosstown Pale, Deschutes Hop Trip Ale . 2. San Francisco . History: 8Breweries: 9Bars: 9Events: 7 . The Bay Area is bursting with micro- and nanobreweries that have been experimenting with food-inspired brews like nowhere else. Take Almanac, which uses seasonal produce in its brews, or Moonlight Brewing Company, which picks redwood twigs and cedar bark from brewer Brian Hunt's own backyard. There's history here, too. The sale of Anchor Steam Brewery in the 1960s precipitated the production of several signature beers at a time when mass-marketed light beers were the trend. The following decade saw the opening of New Albion Brewing in Sonoma, the first new brewery in California since Prohibition and the first microbrewery in America.

The first brewery in Massachusetts emerged not long after the Pilgrims dropped anchor, owing to the fact that beer was safer to drink than the water. Though the Pilgrims were aiming for Virginia, they ran out of brew and stopped in Massachusetts -- thus a beer town was born. Eventually, Boston was blessed with a number of microbreweries, including the best-selling craft brewer in America, Boston Beer Co. -- producer of Samuel Adams -- and Harpoon Brewery. Notable hits on the bar crawl include Cambridge and Cape Ann Brewing Cos., Deep Ellum and The Publick House, alongside historic pubs like Green Dragon, The Warren Tavern (Boston's oldest) and Sunset Grill & Tap. With this lively scene, it's not hard to believe that Boston consumes the most beer per capita in the United States. It's also home to the American Craft Beer Fest, the East Coast's largest celebration of domestic micros, featuring 600+ varieties from 125+ American brewers.

Colorado is fourth out of 50 states in breweries per capita, and while there are only a handful in Denver proper, there are loads of notable breweries outside town and in nearby Boulder. Neighborhoods like Platte Street and the Art District on Santa Fe are peppered with breweries. Elsewhere you'll find Avery, Renegade, New Belgium, Strange Brewing, Dry Dock and others, including Bull & Bush, which writer Steve Body declared ""may well be America's best brewpub and restaurant."" Denver's first craft brewery, Wynkoop, was opened in 1988 by John Hickenlooper, who went on to become mayor, then governor, extending Denver's brewer reach to the highest levels of government. Both Wynkoop and Great Divide are a moon shot from Coors Field, and homemade beers at Blue Moon Brewing Co. are found just behind section 112 in left field. The Mile-High City also stages what is widely regarded the largest, most prestigious beer festival in the country, the annual Great American Beer Festival, drawing sudsmeliers from all over the world to taste more than 2,200 brews.

In the city of brewery love, outfits like Victory, Sly Fox, Nodding Head, Yards and Flying Fish have been vanguards of local brewing since the city's barley rush of the 1990s. And since 1860, McGillin's Olde Ale House has been a beloved showcase for those and other local brews longer than any in Philly. Three less-ancient bars made Draft mag's top 100 -- Eulogy Belgian Tavern, Grey Lodge Public House and Memphis Taproom, which enjoys a sterling reputation despite an endorsement by Guy Fieri. And no beer itinerary is complete without writer Michael Jackson's favorite spot, Monk's Cafe, a love letter to Belgian (and other) brews that will awe the savviest palate. Philly Beer Week is the city's most hoppening event, but the Greater Northeast Philadelphia Beer Festival, begun in 2011, is already proving a worthy companion. One caveat to all this beer-fueled euphoria: complicated state controls regulate the purchase of packaged beer. Don't let them kill your buzz.

It's relatively new to the beer scene, but with 11 breweries yielding the highest per-capita total in the country, it's already building a global rep. A day trip to Asheville offers a chance to try roughly 50 local beers, almost all of which can be tasted at The Thirsty Monk, a must-see on any Ashevillian beer pilgrimage. But it's less the number of breweries or bars here than it is the culture that earns Asheville its cred. There is serious pride in the local craft, and its small-town appeal means all you have to do is roll over and you'll find yourself in one of the city's renowned breweries, like Wedge, Green Man and Wicked Weed. The city also pumps beer into mustards, shampoos, ice creams, cakes, dog biscuits, and soaps. And with at least five major beer events, Asheville keeps the party going all year round with its own Oktoberfest, Beer Week and Winter Warmer, Best Firkin, Beer City and Brewgrass Festivals.

"The U.S. government has obtained a top secret court order that requires Verizon to turn over the telephone records of millions of Americans to the National Security Agency on an ""ongoing daily basis,"" the UK-based Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday. The four-page order, which The Guardian published on its website, requires the communications giant to turn over ""originating and terminating"" telephone numbers as well as the location, time and duration of the calls. The order, published on the newspaper's website, does not require the contents of conversations to be turned over. CNN has so far been unable to independently verify the authenticity of the document. If genuine, the order gives the NSA blanket access to the records of millions of Verizon customers' domestic and foreign phone calls made between April 25, when the order was signed, and July 19, when it expires. Verizon spokesman Edward McFadden declined to comment on the report. According to the document published by The Guardian, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court Judge Roger Vinson signed a ""Secondary Order"" granting an FBI request for access to the records. The FBI did not respond to a CNN request for comment. The NSA told CNN said it will respond ""as soon as we can."" The order does not say why the request was made, but it bans the government and Verizon from making the contents public. ""As far as we know, this order from the FISA court is the broadest surveillance order to ever have been issued: it requires no level of suspicion and applies to all Verizon subscribers anywhere in the U.S.,"" the Center for Constitutional Rights said in a statement released shortly after the story broke. ""It also contains a gag order prohibiting Verizon from disclosing information about the order to anyone other than their counsel."" Former Vice President Al Gore also criticized the move. ""In the digital era, privacy must be a priority. Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?"" he said in a post on Twitter. The order is allowed under the Patriot Act, and it is not the first time such an action has been taken. In 2006, it was revealed that the NSA was secretly collecting telephone records as part of an effort to root out potential terror plots. Reacting to Wednesday's disclosure, the American Civil Liberties Union called for an immediate end to the order and a congressional investigation into the move. ""It's a program in which some untold number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance of government agents,"" Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU's deputy legal director, said. ""It is beyond Orwellian, and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies."" The news about the Verizon order comes as the Obama administration is under fire following revelations that the Justice Department seized two months of telephone records of a number of Associated Press reporters and editors, saying the requests were part of an investigation into the leak of classified information. Justice officials haven't specified the leak that triggered the probe, but the AP has said it believes the investigation focuses on its account of a foiled plot to bomb a U.S. airliner in May 2012.","The Guardian newspaper says it has obtained a top secret court order .

"Remember when woolly mammoths roamed the planet? No? Well don't worry if you missed the last ice age -- scientists have moved one step closer to possibly bringing the beasts back to life with the discovery of liquid blood in a well-preserved mammoth carcass in Siberia. Researchers from the Northeast Federal University in Yakutsk found the 10,000-year-old female mammoth buried in ice on the Lyakhovsky Islands off the coast of northeast Russia. Scientists say they poked the frozen creature with a pick and dark liquid blood flowed out. ""The fragments of muscle tissues, which we've found out of the body, have a natural red color of fresh meat. The reason for such preservation is that the lower part of the body was underlying in pure ice,"" said Semyon Grigoriev, the head of the expedition and of the university's Mammoth Museum, in a statement on the university's website. ""The blood is very dark, it was found in ice cavities below the belly and when we broke these cavities with a poll pick, the blood came running out,"" he said. ""Interestingly, the temperature at the time of excavation was -7 to -10ºC. It may be assumed that the blood of mammoths had some cryoprotective properties."" Ice age baby mammoth goes on display in Hong Kong . Cryoprotectant is a substance found in modern fish and amphibians living in the Arctic and Antarctic that minimizes the damage to the creatures' tissue in freezing temperatures. Grigoriev told The Siberian Times newspaper it was the first time mammoth blood had been discovered and called it ""the best preserved mammoth in the history of paleontology."" ""We suppose that the mammoth fell into water or got bogged down in a swamp, could not free herself and died. Due to this fact the lower part of the body, including the lower jaw, and tongue tissue, was preserved very well,"" he said. Grigoriev called the liquid blood ""priceless material"" for the university's joint project with South Korean scientists who are hoping to clone a woolly mammoth, which has been extinct for thousands of years. The controversial Sooam Biotech Research Foundation is headed up by Hwang Woo-suk -- the disgraced former Seoul National University scientist who claimed in 2004 that he had successfully cloned human embryonic stem cells before admitting he had faked his findings. Hwang, who also cloned the world's first puppy, was forced to admit he had fabricated the stem cell data and apologized in January 2006 after a panel of scientists found he had not derived human stem cells from eggs, as he claimed. A one-hour documentary about the joint Russia-South Korean quest to clone a mammoth from the creature's remains aired on the National Geographic Channel in the U.S. in April. Grigoriev says the mammoth carcass has not been moved yet for fear of damaging it -- and that his team will join foreign researches in Siberia for further research in July.

"(CNN) -- High fashion isn't often inspired by environmental hazards, but as air pollution levels soared in Beijing last week, models at China Fashion Week walked the runway wearing designer respiratory face masks. The QIAODAN Yin Peng Sports Wear Collection showcased fashion and function in the same breath at the biannual event, which runs through the weekend. Some outfits had built-in face masks while others featured smog masks coordinated to match the ensemble. The runway shows briefly coincide with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, for which Beijing is implementing strict pollution controls. The city is limiting traffic and shutting down industrial factories to help air quality conditions. Similar measures were taken for the 2008 Summer Olympics. This month, Beijing International Marathon participants came prepared with face masks and sponges to combat smog levels that were deemed ""hazardous"" by the United States Embassy. Yin Peng, the designer, said he was surprised his collection had attracted so much attention and said the smoggy environment was not his main inspiration. ""From my perspective, no matter how good the outside environment is, the key is how we mix the situation outside with our hearts,"" he told CNN. 9 things that make air pollution bearable . As the Chinese high-end fashion market continues to grow rapidly, luxury brands are noting that the fashion-forward truly want a complete head-to-toe look. Even on the chic runways of Paris Fashion Week in October, Chinese designer Masha Ma accessorized models with Swarovski crystal-studded face masks amid quilted bomber jackets and sleek modern separates. Ma, along with other Chinese designers like SANKUANZ, Qiu Hao and Xander Zhou, also collaborated with luxury e-commerce site Yoox on a series of couture masks as part of their eco-friendly initiative, Yooxygen. Other companies like Vogmask and Respro are capitalizing on the business of functional fashion.

"A ground-breaking cell transplant has allowed a paralyzed man to walk again, researchers announced Tuesday. Polish man Darek Fidyka, 38, had been left paralyzed from the chest down after a 2010 knife attack caused an 8mm gap in his spinal cord. An initial 13 months of rehabilitation followed by an additional  8-month program before the experimental treatment had not produced an improvement in his condition, researchers said. But two years after the 2012 cell transplant he can walk with the aid of a Zimmer frame, also known as a walker. Scientists at University College London (UCL) developed the treatment, which saw olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) from the nose transplanted to Fidyka's spinal cord. OECs are what allow the sense of smell to return when nerve cells in the nose are damaged. Surgeons at Wroclaw University in Poland led by Dr Pawel Tabakow injected the OECs above and below Fidyka's spinal cord gap, then used nerve tissue taken from his ankle to act as a bridge for spinal nerves to grow across, UCL said. Three months after the surgery, Fidyka's thigh muscle began to grow and three months after that he started to walk with leg braces and the help of a physiotherapist, researchers said. Being able to walk with a Zimmer frame or walker two years on, Fidyka said, was an incredible feeling. ""When you can't feel almost half your body, you are helpless, but when it starts coming back it's as if you were born again,"" he said. Bladder sensation and some sexual function have also returned, the UCL said. UCL's Professor Geoff Raisman discovered OECs in 1985 and headed the team whose research led to the breakthrough. Previous studies have shown these cells to be popular candidates for research on repairing spinal cord injuries. These are not the same cells like the controversial human embryonic stem cells used in the Geron Corporation's 2010 trial in the United States. Before that trial was stopped due to funding issues, none of the patients enrolled were able to walk. A 2012 Swiss study launched by California-based StemCells Inc, led to some sensations returning in one patient. Spinal 'roadway' In an interview with CNN's Isa Soares, Raisman explained how his idea had developed. ""The problem with spinal injury is that nerve fibers are severed by the injury so that impulses that carry movement -- the desire for movement -- down from the brain to the body are cut off. Impulses carrying sensations up from the body to the brain are cut off,"" he said. ""So, my idea, which I followed for many, many years, is that actually the nervous system is capable of repairing itself, actually the cut nerve fibers are capable of growing back -- but they lack a pathway to cross the injury. ""So it's as though a motorway has been damaged. The cars still know where they want to go, but there is no roadway for them to go across. Thinking that way, the question is -- what could we use to make a bridge. ""Now, we don't know how the bridge would work, we don't understand the basis of this, so our idea was 'is there somewhere else where nerve fibers are able to relay the road?' and the only place we know is the olfactory system, the sense of smell. ""The underlying idea is 'can we get something out of an area where repair works and transfer it into an area where repair doesn't work and will it then cause a repair?.'"" Raisman compared the process to repairing a washed-out motorway. ""What you have to do is put a bridge across the injury. Exactly the same applies to the spinal cord -- the nerve fibers which have been cut are trying to grow, they're trying to find their way across. ""They can't get across because there's a damage, there's scarring on either side -- there are road barriers up. What we have to do is pull down those barriers and build a bridge along which they can grow. ""That's what these cells are doing,"" he said. The OECs carried out the same regenerative function for the nerve fibers of the spinal cord as they did for the olfactory system, he said. But Raisman stressed that the procedure needed to be further developed: ""Until we repeat this in a number more patients it's just that one patient."" 'Not convinced breakthrough' Dr. Barth Green, Professor and Chairman of Neurological Surgery at University of Miami Health System echoed that sentiment. ""They've got one patient who did well and that's a wonderful,"" he told CNN but added that he was not convinced it was a breakthrough: ""If you can't reproduce it, it's not real."" Fidyka's spinal cord had not been completely severed in the knife attack meaning -- while he had an 8mm gap -- 2mm of tissue remained, Green said. Greene said laboratory studies had shown much more significant recovery in patients whose spinal cords were only partially severed. He queried whether the rehabilitation Fidyka had had before the new treatment had been a factor in his recovery. ""The question is it all the physical therapy, or the cells he's getting?"" Green said. ""I'm not convinced that this is a breakthrough,"" he said. ""It definitely isn't the answer for everybody -- or even everybody with the same injury -- until we have more examples with more than one patient."" 'Provocative' Edelle Field-Fote, PT, Ph.D., director of spinal cord injury research at Shepherd Center in U.S. city of Atlanta said the researchers' findings were a ""very provocative outcome."" ""If similar results are observed beyond this one patient, then bulbar olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) would be a game-changer,"" Field-Fote said. ""While prior (unsuccessful) studies used OECs harvested from the nasal mucosa (i.e., tissue in the nose), these OECs were harvested from the area where they grow -- just below the brain. ""It is possible that obtaining these cells from their source using this more invasive approach made the difference, but it won't be possible to know until results from more people are available."" Field-Fote noted that Fidyka had also had scar tissue removed and that there had been documented cases where this process had resulted in improved function. Funding . In a statement released by the UCL Tuesday, Raisman said the development of the technique was ""immensely gratifying."" ""I believe we stand on the threshold of a historic advance and that the continuation of our work will be of major benefit to mankind. I believe we have now opened the door to a treatment of spinal cord injury that will get patients out of wheel chairs,"" Raisman said. Researchers now need to develop the procedure to a point where it could be rolled out world wide, he said. The research was funded by the UK Stem Cell Foundation and Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation (nsif). Nsif was founded by David Nicholls after his son Daniel was instantly paralyzed after diving into a sandbank during a gap year in Australia in 2003. ""One of the most devastating moments a parent will ever experience is the sight of their son or daughter lying motionless in a bed and facing the reality that they may never walk again,"" David Nicholls said in a statement on the development. ""The young man who was in the bed next to Dan in Australia, also paralyzed from the neck down, had parents who were so traumatized by the finality of their son's condition that they came to visit him once and never came back,"" he said. ""I promised Dan that I would not give up until a cure had been found. Professor Geoffrey Raisman and Dr. Pawel Tabakow's breakthrough marks the first step."" The full research paper is published in the medical journal ""Cell Transplantation.""","Researchers say a 2012 cell transplant has allowed a paralyzed man to walk again .

"The Supreme Court sidestepped a sweeping decision on the use of race-conscious school admission policies, ruling Monday on the criteria at the University of Texas and whether it violates the equal protection rights of some white applicants. The justices threw the case back to the lower courts for further review. The court affirmed the use of race in the admissions process, but made it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity. The 7-1 decision avoids the larger constitutional issues. Read the decision (.PDF) Abigail Noel Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land, Texas. She claims it was because she is white and that she was being treated differently than some less-qualified minority students who were accepted. In a statement after the ruling Fisher said, ""I am grateful to the justices for moving the nation closer to the day when a student's race isn't used at all in college admissions."" The decision comes as the justices work toward wrapping up a busy term. Among the big issues yet to be resolved: federal enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and the politically blockbuster constitutionality of same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court plans to meet again on Tuesday to issue additional opinions. In the Texas case, the school defended its policy of considering race as one of many factors, such as test scores, community service, leadership, and work experience, designed to create a diverse campus. University encouraged by decision . The university said it was encouraged by the decision. ""We remain committed to assembling a student body at The University of Texas at Austin that provides the educational benefits of diversity on campus while respecting the rights of all students and acting within the constitutional framework established by the court,"" said school President Bill Powers. The Obama administration agreed with the school, saying to grow a nation built on differing complexions and backgrounds will depend on future leaders ""who possess the understanding of diversity that is necessary to govern and defend the United States."" In ruling narrowly, the court reaffirmed earlier decisions allowing for a limited use of race-conscious public policies. ""The attainment of a diverse student body serves values beyond race alone, including enhanced classroom dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and stereotypes,"" wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority opinion. Ex-student challenges university's affirmative action policy . But Kennedy said that such admissions programs must withstand close review. Kennedy said the ""university must prove that the means chosen"" to attain diversity ""are narrowly tailored to that goal,"" adding that the highest level of legal standard must be met before institutions use diversity programs. ""Strict scrutiny (of the policy) imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to racial classification, that available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice,"" he said. The Supreme Court in recent decades has established a three-pronged test to balance the government's interest against a constitutional right or principle, and decide which laws may go too far. These standards of review are rational basis scrutiny, heightened scrutiny, and strict scrutiny. Kennedy said the appropriate standard was not applied properly by the lower federal courts in the Fisher case. He said state universities must demonstarte to the courts that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the desired educational and social benefits. Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, who are more left-leaning, agreed with the Supreme Court's five conservatives. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas also agreed with the limited reach of the ruling, but separately suggested continuing use of diversity programs in the classroom were unconstitutional. ""Although cloaked in good intentions, the university's racial tinkering harms the very people it claims to be helping,"" said Thomas, the court's only African-American, who himself benefited from affirmative action programs early in his academic and professional career. Only Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg disagreed with the majority's conclusion lower courts should take another look at the Fisher case. ""Government actors need not be blind to to the lingering effects of an overtly discriminatory past,"" she said. ""I have said before and reiterate here that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly neutral alternative as race unconscious."" Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case because she apparently had been briefed on the issue as the Obama administration's solicitor general before joining the high court. Three questions for Clarence Thomas . Ideological differences . The justices said in 2003 that state universities can, in limited circumstances, tailor their admissions policies to consider an applicant's race. And this court was clearly divided along ideological lines during last October's oral arguments about whether affirmative action essentially has run its social and legal course, and should no longer be used in the way schools like the Texas university has done. The state of Texas provides for a hybrid admissions policy: Automatic acceptance to its university's main campus in Austin for in-state students finishing in the top 10 percent of their high schools, ensuring a measure of non-subjective diversity. Three-fourths of the in-state student body get in this way. Fisher just missed that opportunity, so had to compete in a separate pool of students seeking to attend the highly competitive school. It is that selection process that was before the court. The school, with 52,000 students, has touted its ""holistic"" policy of considering race as one of many factors. African-Americans in Texas as a whole represent about 12 percent of the overall population, but only make up about 5 or 6 percent of University of Texas admissions. The high court will get another crack at the issue this fall in a separate appeal. The justices will decide the constitutionality of a voter referendum in Michigan banning race- and sex-based discrimination or preferential treatment in public university admission decisions. Oral arguments are likely in October. The case is Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin (11-345).

On a Reddit thread about the video, one person asked, ""If a guy can't open a conversation with 'How are you doing today?' then what is he supposed to open it with?"" Good question. Being a nuisance . There can be a fine line between flirtation and harassment, and it's been used for comic effect in movies and television shows. ""Has anyone ever told you that you have the face of a Botticelli and the body of a Degas?"" asked Robert Downey Jr. in the 1987 movie ""The Pick-Up Artist."" Sure, there are men and women who sometimes do want a quick fling with a passer-by. For them, maybe come-ons and catcalls work. Still, only in a romantic comedy -- albeit one written and directed by the shrewd and flinty James Toback -- would Downey's character make women swoon. As Chris Rock has noted, ""Every time a man's being nice to you, all he's doing is offering d**k."" Which is why would-be lotharios should tread lightly. ""You almost never approach it,"" said Troy Patterson, Slate's urbane Gentleman Scholar columnist. ""Almost always, the guy is going to be making a nuisance of himself. I can't see a reason to ever greet a strange woman with anything more intrusive than a quiet, warm smile."" Women have been saying this for years, of course. ""Street harassment has a negative effect on us all. No single man wants the actions of a few to be attributed to his entire gender, but studies show that male harassers impact victims' perception and reaction to men in general,"" wrote Katie Baker in a 2010 essay. Baker observed that one catcaller was caught off-guard when a woman called him on his behavior. The man, abashed, said that he understood: He had sisters, and he wouldn't want them treated the same way. 'Talk to her, not at her' Baker offers a simple solution: respect. ""There's a huge difference between harassing a woman and trying to start a conversation,"" she wrote. ""Here are some tips: talk to her, not at her. Treat her with respect: be aware of her personal space, ask her how she's doing or what she's reading instead of commenting on her body parts, look at her face instead of her chest. If she ignores you, drops eye contact, or walks away, back off. ""It wasn't rude of you to approach her, but she's not being rude if she doesn't want to keep talking to you, especially if you initiated conversation while she was running an errand, waiting for the bus, or on her computer at a coffee shop."" Manuel Abril, an activist and filmmaker who serves on the board of StopStreetHarassment.org, points out that the problem is one of dehumanization. ""It's not taking (women's) word at face value,"" he said. ""Men are socialized to think that women don't really say what they mean."" Moreover, he adds, society tends to judge women the way they dress. ""We're taught not to see women as human beings on the street,"" Abril said. ""The way they look totally supersedes their humanity."" Opinion: Attention, men: Stop with the catcalls . A way for 'dudes to blow off steam'? Not all greetings are out of bounds. There is the matter of context, Patterson says. Early-morning runners and dog-walkers may offer courteous ""good mornings"" to one another as if they're part of a big club, while doormen and shopkeepers don't lose points for an appropriate, welcoming attitude. But commenting on a woman's form as she walks past? Not acceptable. Even the reaction men sometimes see -- a smile -- can be a defense mechanism to get the comments to stop, says Abril. So why make comments at all? ""Catcalling is, in general, a way to relieve boredom during a dull workday and establish 'hey we are all straight!' amongst guys working together,"" a ""Guysourcing"" contributor explained to Jezebel. ""It wasn't an attempt to hit on the woman or to be threatening. It was just a way for the dudes to blow off a bit of steam and be like 'We are men!' "" On the Reddit thread, which has drawn more than 6,500 comments, one man observed that lack of respect knows no gender. ""As a fat guy who once walked around NYC for a day sightseeing I got so many comments,"" he wrote. ""'Lose weight, ass***e!' 'Hey fatty want me to buy you a hot dog?' 'Hey kill yourself you fat f***' I would have been happy with just a 'good morning.' "" In the right context, so would most people. ""If your baseline value is showing respect to all people, everything will be OK,"" Patterson said.","Video of woman being catcalled on streets of NYC gets huge reaction .

"Former South African leader Nelson Mandela is in ""serious but stable condition"" at a Pretoria hospital with a recurring lung infection, the presidential spokesman said Saturday. Mandela was hospitalized early Saturday after the state of his health deteriorated in the last few days, according to spokesman Mac Maharaj. ""He's receiving the best possible care,"" he said. ""Everything is being done to ensure that he is comfortable and that he is getting better."" Maharaj said that the anti-apartheid icon is breathing on his own. Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, is at the hospital with him, sources told CNN. She canceled her plans to attend the Hunger Summit meeting in London on Saturday. South Africa's first black president gets round-the-clock care, and his house is retrofitted with medical equipment that mirrors that of an intensive care unit. Mandela, 94, has become increasingly frail over the years and has not appeared in public since South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010. Despite his rare public appearances, news of his ailment spark concerns worldwide. ""I think the concern, the anxiety shown by people throughout the world and South Africa is perfectly understandable,"" Maharaj said. ""I think it is also true simultaneously that people have come to terms with his age. The most important thing is that we should realize that this is a life that we need to celebrate, even when he's with us. And we will celebrate it, even when he is not with us."" Mandela has been in and out of hospitals in recent years. His history of lung problems dates to when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island during apartheid, and he has battled respiratory infections over the years. Last year, he spent Christmas holidays undergoing treatment for a lung infection and gallstones, one of his longest hospital stays since his release from prison in 1990. Considered the founding father of South Africa's democracy, Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the country's system of racial segregation. ""He has taught us ... that we enhance our own humanity when we serve and make a difference to other people's lives,"" Maharaj said. ""It's easy to serve oneself, own interests, but serving the interests of others, making their lives better changes the quality of all humanity."" In 1993, Mandela and then-South African President F.W. de Klerk jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize. The iconic leader was elected the nation's first black president a year later, serving only one term, as he had promised. Despite rare public appearances in recent years, he retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. Last year, South Africa launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front, a testament to his iconic status. Mandela's impact extends far beyond South African borders. After he left office, he mediated conflicts from Africa to the Middle East.","""Anxiety shown by people throughout the world is perfectly understandable,"" spokesman says .

"(CNN)Before Ellen DeGeneres was out and proud and dancing every day on her talk show, when heterosexual male actors wouldn't dare to play gay, and violence against gay people was the talking point of the day for LGBT activists, there was transgender activist Leslie Feinberg. It's hard to find Feinberg's 1993 classic novel, ""Stone Butch Blues,"" today. The novel's protagonist starts out as a girl and moves through the identities of being lesbian, butch and a man in the 1960s and 1970s. ""You're more than just neither, honey,"" Feinberg wrote in ""Stone Butch Blues."" ""There's other ways to be than either-or. It's not so simple. Otherwise there wouldn't be so many people who don't fit."" Like the customers who had enough of police brutality and rioted at New York's Stonewall Inn in 1969 and energized a movement, there was no closet big enough to hold Feinberg, who passed away November 15 at age 65. Feinberg died at home in Syracuse, New York, from complications from several infections, her spouse of 22 years, Minnie Bruce Pratt, told The Advocate. She was working on the 20th anniversary edition of ""Stone Butch Blues"" when she died. When I first read her book, the landscape for LGBT rights was very different. For a 20-something like me coming out in the early 1990s, there was nothing trendy or cool about being out. It was dangerous territory. Forget ever getting married: There was no law that protected me from being fired or attacked because of my identity. I didn't ""look"" gay so I could hide, as I had through my teen years and most of my undergraduate education. I could quietly enjoy the benefits of the work done by Feinberg and other transgender activists, butch women, gay men and drag queens who could not or would not fade into the shadows. Feinberg and the other people who would not be silent taught me that was not a way to live, to truly live, standing on the backs of others without lifting any of the load myself. Always a writer and journalist, I came out during my last year in college, stayed out in graduate school, and have been out at every job I've ever held; I did service work in my profession to bridge the gaps between journalists of different racial, ethnic, LGBT and other identities. I know other members of the LGBT community feel the same way about Feinberg. ""Reading 'Stone Butch Blues' in '93 and later 'Transgender Warriors,' I was able to recognize and name my own gender queerness,"" activist Candace Gingrich wrote me. ""Feinberg's quote 'Gender is the poetry each of us makes out of the language we are taught' is a truth that trans and genderqueer people live every day, and I'm grateful for the wordsmith (Feinberg) helped me become."" We never met, but I suspect Feinberg and I would have disagreed on Cuba and other parts of her political life. But that she had a larger and diverse political agenda was one of her many strengths. She fought for workers' rights, marched against racism, protested against the Klan and fought for abortion rights in upstate New York. Gay rights, transgender rights, workers' rights, any rights: They did not exist in a vacuum to Feinberg. There was no parachuting into a town to get everyone rising up for gay rights but forgetting when those allies needed help on race or gender or other issues. Feinberg linked them all together, organized and protested in the streets and fought for all of us. That's what stands out to my friend Ina Fried, an openly transgendered journalist and senior editor at Re/code. ""It was the real-life struggle for justice, particularly economic justice that was Feinberg's life work and passion,"" Fried wrote to me. ""With Feinberg's death we each have more work to do to make this a fairer and more just world."" For all the progress that's been made, I can still get fired for my identity in the state in which I live, and I still can't get married (or divorced) here. But I haven't been afraid for a very long time. That was Feinberg's gift to me, and to you.","Leslie Feinberg fought for justice across all lines .

"(CNN)The final round of qualifiers for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations threw up a few surprises, the most notable of which being holders Nigeria bowing out. The results of Wednesday evening also presented some potential logistical issues, as Guinea progressed to the finals next January, highlighting the problems that Ebola fears may cloud the event. The ruling African football body, CAF, last week removed Morocco as host, handing hosting duties to 2012 co-host Equatorial Guinea. The North African country had voiced concerns over the spread of the deadly disease in a number of West African countries and requested a postponement. As a further consequence, its team has been expelled from the competition, . The controversy had threatened to overwhelm the final round of games, played out this week, but by the end of Wednesday the 16 teams who will travel to the finals were known. Elephants ease into Finals . Ivory Coast qualified behind Group D winner Cameroon after a goalless draw between the two teams. The result was enough to fend off a late challenge from DR Congo after its 3-1 victory over Sierra Leone in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa. DR Congo's result, however, helped the team garner an impressive total of nine points, which saw the Leopards progress as the best-performing third place team from the seven groups, narrowly beating the reigning champions Nigeria to the remaining qualifying spot. Super Eagles crash out . Nigeria has been a regular fixture in the finals of the competition since its early days, but will be a notable absentee in Equatorial Guinea, mirroring 2010 holders Egypt in failing to qualify for the following edition of the tournament in 2012. The Super Eagles were held 2-2 by South Africa in Uyo, giving second-place in Group A to Congo, as the team recorded a 1-0 victory over Sudan in Khartoum. The South Africans topped Group A with 12 points from their qualifying campaign. Niger and Mozambique played out a dead rubber with a 1-1 draw, with fellow Group F teams Cape Verde and Zambia already having qualified before kick-off on Wednesday. Burkina Faso's draw with Angola was also largely academic, the west African nation having already joined Gabon in qualifying from Group C. Keita magic . Meanwhile, Mali booked their spot for the seventh consecutive time with a standout performance from captain Seydou Keita. The Roma midfielder opened the scoring with a well-taken penalty. Mali finished runners-up in Group B behind Algeria. A poor showing in Tunisia by Egypt saw the 2010 champions lose 2-1, and miss out on a place at the finals. Ghana's Black Stars ensured they progressed from Group F with a routine 3-1 win over neighbors Togo. They will be joined in the finals by Guinea, after a 2-0 victory over Uganda in the Moroccan city of Casablanca -- Ebola fears in the West African country ruling out home matches for the time being.

"A face you know is gone. Actor Ed Lauter may not have been a shooting star, but he was no flash in the pan. After a four decade-long career, Lauter died Wednesday at age 74 of a rare cancer, mesothelioma, caused by asbestos exposure, his publicist  said. You may not recognize Lauter's name, but his long, thin, bald visage has shown up in many places. Often with a stern, squinting mien, other times with a debonaire smile cocked up on the right side of his face. From ""Mannix"" in early 1970's and on TV regularly since then, Lauter played detectives, sheriffs or mobster heavies. You're likely to have caught him in small roles in TV shows such as ""Kojak,"" ""Charlie's Angels,"" ""Magnum P.I.,"" ""Miami Vice,"" ""The X-Files,"" ""Law and Order,"" ""ER,"" and ""Grey's Anatomy."" The list goes on. One of his biggest roles was that of Captain Knauer in the movie ""The Longest Yard"" with Burt Reynolds.  And more recently, you may have seen him in the Oscar winning movie ""The Artist,"" in the role of Peppy's butler. Lauter seemed to have been the opposite of the out-of-work actor, in demand for roles up to the end. He shot three movies that have yet to be released.

"It was clear from the statement from the National Security Council (NSC) on Monday that the United States is deeply annoyed with Hong Kong. Couched in diplomatic language, the statement spelled out Washington's position: Hong Kong dropped the ball on Edward Snowden and the U.S. wants Russia to pick it up. ""We are disappointed by the decision of the authorities in Hong Kong to permit Mr. Snowden to flee despite the legally valid U.S. request to arrest him for purposes of his extradition under the U.S.-Hong Kong Surrender Agreement,"" said NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden in a statement. ""We have registered our strong objections to the authorities in Hong Kong as well as to the Chinese government through diplomatic channels and noted that such behavior is detrimental to U.S.-Hong Kong and U.S.-China bilateral relations."" The statement went on to remind Russia that the U.S. had in the past returned numerous high-level criminals at the request of the Russian government. ""We expect the Russian Government to look at all options available to expel Mr. Snowden back to the U.S. to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged."" While there has been speculation that Beijing was behind the final decision to allow NSA leaker Snowden to leave Hong Kong -- a semi-autonomous Chinese territory -- on Sunday, Hong Kong authorities insist the judicial process was independent of China. Simon Young Ngai-man, director of the Centre for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, downplayed the apparent spat between Washington and Hong saying there may be nothing more to the Hong Kong decision than what it has publicly maintained: that Washington failed to meet the requirements under Hong Kong law that would have allowed the police to detain Snowden. ""We don't know all the details as to why the Hong Kong government said the paperwork for the request was not in place; maybe the U.S. government rushed in sending their package over and really didn't submit a good set of documents,"" Young said, adding that he thought the response from the U.S. Justice Department had been fairly measured. Nevertheless, he said that getting a provisional warrant in order required a ""low threshold"" of preparation. ""Why didn't Hong Kong authorities move more quickly? Hong Kong authorities would probably say this is just our protocol, this is how we do these things and in this case we didn't see any reason to make it an exception or treat it with any greater urgency."" A U.S. Justice Department official said that the United States had met requirements and disputed the assertion from Hong Kong's government. Despite fears bilateral ties between the U.S. and Hong Kong could be damaged, Young said the relationship between the two governments was too deep and longstanding for the extradition drama to have any permanent affect. ""It may well be they will just sort of brush it under the carpet as a regrettable incident and it probably won't have any implications beyond that,"" Young said. ""It's probably too early to say, but my intuition is that there probably won't be too much (fallout from Snowden)."" While the Hong Kong statement on Snowden pointedly requested a clarification from Washington of Snowden's claims that the U.S. had hacked targets in the territory, Young said he believed that this was aimed at domestic concerns over Snowden rather than any veiled attack on Washington. ""It simply says to the Hong Kong people you've expressed a lot of concern about this, CY Leung (the territory's chief executive) has said he is going to make inquiries and I think it just reiterated that,"" he said. Other analysts said that Hong Kong and Beijing were probably relieved that a potentially protracted and embarrassing diplomatic problem was now outside their jurisdiction. Jin Canrong, a leading foreign relations scholar and associate dean of Renmin University's School of International Relations in Beijing, told Hong Kong's South China Morning Post that Snowden's departure was ideal for Beijing. ""A time bomb that could threaten the Sino-U.S. relationship has been defused, even though the saga will go on and Snowden can still make more revelations. The strategy Beijing has been using in dealing with the case was to let Hong Kong handle it independently and keep a distance from it. I believe Beijing would not proactively take advantage of the intelligence Snowden revealed, because that would provoke Washington and rub salt into its wounds."" Jin also told the paper:  ""Actually Beijing made some gains from the Snowden saga, because his revelations provided Beijing some bargaining chips for future negotiations with Washington in cybersecurity; Washington has lost the moral high ground on this front."" Analysts say China has used Snowden's claims that the U.S. hacked computer networks in Hong Kong and the mainland to put the U.S. on the defensive in their ongoing cybersecurity dispute. Meanwhile, analysts will be waiting anxiously to see if Washington files any official complaint over the matter. Whether the requisite amount of face -- an essential part of the Chinese diplomatic discourse -- has been saved from the Snowden saga has still to play out. ""I think in the long run (it will be resolved), but there will be questions asked,"" Young said.","Washington sends tersely worded statement to Hong Kong over Snowden case .
Understated language spells out U.S. anger that Snowden was allowed to leave for Moscow .
Speculation strong Beijing was behind decision to allow Snowden to leave Hong Kong .

"Washington (CNN)The former Navy SEAL who says he shot and killed Osama bin Laden had just returned from his 11th deployment when he was called back for the 2011 raid on the U.S.'s most wanted terrorist's Pakistan compound. But Robert O'Neill and his SEAL Team Six teammates didn't know they were preparing for a raid in Pakistan. And they didn't know bin Laden was the target. ""They sat us in a room and they said, 'Hey we found a thing. And the thing's in a house and the house is in a bowl and the bowl is in a country and you're going to go to that house and you're going to get that thing and you're going to bring it back to us.' And that was it,"" O'Neill recounted in a Fox News interview that aired Tuesday night. O'Neill has faced heat from other Navy SEALs who have either discredited his claims or said that it's impossible for O'Neill to know that it was his bullets that struck and killed bin Laden. Without directly addressing O'Neill and his claims, the military brass wrote a timely letter criticizing SEALs who take public credit for their actions. ""We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety or financial gain,"" commanding officer B.L. Losey and force master sergeant M.L. Margaraci said in an October 31 letter to the Naval Special Warfare ranks. O'Neill said he and his colleagues, all senior SEALs, initially assumed the target was Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhaffi as the timing coincided with the NATO intervention in the North African country. But as planners began sharing the names of certain people linked to the raid, it clicked for O'Neill and his fellow SEALs. ""It's bin Laden. They found him. We're going to get him,"" O'Neill recalled. O'Neill initially wasn't slated to be part of the team that would raid the compound itself. He was supposed to be the leader of a small team responsible for security outside the compound. But the lead CIA analyst -- who was portrayed by Jessica Chastain in the film ""Zero Dark Thirty"" -- told O'Neill, ""If you want to kill him. He's on the third floor. 100%."" ""So I actually talked myself out of a team leader spot so I could stay on the helicopter and then go to the roof,"" O'Neill said, becoming part of the unit the SEALs referred to as the ""martyr's brigade."" ""The more we trained on it the more we realized this is gonna be a one-way mission. We're gonna go and we're not gonna come back. We're gonna die when the house blows up, we're going to die when he blows up or we're gonna be there too long and we're gonna get arrested by the Pakistanis and we're going to spend the rest of our short lives in Pakistan prison,"" O'Neill said. But O'Neill brushed off the criticism in an audio interview that aired Friday on CNN's ""AC360°"" ""Even now, I mean, there are guys now saying that I am full of s---,"" he said. ""You only know what you were told unless you were in the room. And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden.""","The former SEAL has dismissed criticism surrounding his decision to go public .

"A former mayor is a ""probable"" suspect in the disappearance of 43 students who were kidnapped last month from Iguala, a small city in Guerrero state, Mexican authorities said. Mexican Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam said Wednesday his office has issued arrest warrants for former Iguala Mayor José Luis Abarca; his wife, Maria de los Ángeles Pineda Villa; and the city's former public safety director, Felipe Flores Velásquez.  Murillo said they are considered ""probable masterminds"" of events that occurred in Iguala on September 26. According to the attorney general, on that day, a group of students from a teachers college in the nearby town of Ayotzinapa were on their way to stage a protest in Iguala.  When the former mayor and his wife learned the protest would disrupt an event led by the mayor's wife, they gave orders to their public safety director to send police forces to prevent the students from protesting. ""The order to confront those people came from the police department's command center, straight from A-5, code name used to identify the Iguala mayor,"" Murillo said.  The attorney general also said his office learned this information from interrogations of police officers and gang members detained in the last month who were allegedly involved in the incident. Police officers blocked the highway leading into the city and shot at the students as they arrived in buses and a van.  One student was killed. Footage from the scene shows a white van left in the middle of the road with its windows blown out and the doors wide open. The students, Murillo said, were subsequently taken away by police officers, who handed them over to a local criminal gang known as Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors), which had infiltrated not only the police department but was also complicit with Mayor Abarca, his wife and the public safety director.  All three disappeared the day after the clashes between police and the students. It has been almost a month since the incident and the students are still missing.  Fifty-three people, including 36 officers and 17 suspected gang members, have been detained. No one was available for comment at the Iguala Police Department.  The Mexican federal police and army have taken over the department and assumed all security responsibilities. Twenty-eight bodies were found in mass graves in the state of Guerrero, but DNA tests showed there were no missing students among those victims. Mexico was shocked this week by the revelations of a Roman Catholic priest and well-known activist who works with migrants and trafficking victims.  The Rev. Alejandro Solalinde said the students were forced to walk to a remote location and then shot. ""Some who were wounded but still alive, with others who were already dead -- one, two, we don't know how many -- were put on top of firewood and set on fire with diesel,""  Solalinde said.  He said he has given his information to prosecutors. The case has become a political crisis, with opposition lawmakers asking President Enrique Peña Nieto to dissolve the entire Guerrero state government and take charge.  Peña Nieto has said his government will not spare any efforts until the students are found and justice is done. ""Violence, whatever its origin, goes against what we are as a country.  Violence will never be a solution or pave the way towards a better future,"" the President said. Mexican authorities are offering a reward of nearly $5 million for information leading to finding the students and solving the case. Online, international students are also demanding answers.  A video posted on YouTube shows young people from different countries ""demanding justice for the 43 Mexican students who went missing on September 26,"" in multiple languages.","43 students intending to protest in Iguala vanished on September 26 .

"An investigation into the killing of the most senior U.S. military officer since 9/11 found the incident could not have been ""foreseen"" or ""prevented,"" according to a military report out Thursday. Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, who was leading efforts to train soldiers in Afghanistan, was killed by a member of the Afghan National Army on Aug. 5 during a visit to a military training facility in Kabul. The report was from the International Security Assistance Force, which serves as NATO's command over allied military operations in Afghanistan. Greene, along with more than 90 other US and Coalition personnel, visited the Marshal Fahim National Defense University to take a look at the construction of a site at the school that would serve officers in the Afghan Army. According to the report, overall security at the site was provided by Danish forces, but there were protection forces from the United States, United Kingdom and Germany also present.  But despite ""extensive security planning"" for the event, the report said ""there was no comprehensive plan that incorporated all participating security elements,"" as each individual security detachment did their own preparation. ""The threat level that day was assessed as low, with no indicators of unusual activity or concern,"" the report said. ISAF identified the shooter as Rafiqullah, a soldier with the Afghan Army who entered the barracks at the university where the presentation was taking place and positioned himself in a nearby bathroom in direct view of the delegation and fired 27 -- 30 rounds in to the crowd. In addition to Greene, 18 others were seriously wounded.  Two Coalition Force Soldiers returned fire and killed the shooter. ""Although there have been many leads, nothing has yet materialized that conclusively links the shooter to any plots, plans or person of interest,"" the report said. ""It appears the shooting was not pre-meditated, and the shooter simply took advantage a target of opportunity provided by the close gathering."" The report raised the possibility the shooter may have been ""self-radicalized"" or suffered from some type of psychological condition. While visits to the site from various officials are a regular occurrence, the report said the incident appeared to be an ""isolated act of a determined shooter without indicators or warnings."" ISAF made recommendations for greater risk assessment planning of such events and visits in the future, as well as a review of ISAF's standard on the use of personal protective equipment.","Maj. Gen.

"(CNN) -- There can be life after death -- or at least in American politics as we have just seen with the U.S. Senate's approval of Dr. Vivek Murthy as the next U.S. surgeon general. It 's a small political miracle that promises to serve the nation well over the next two years. When President Barack Obama first nominated Dr. Murthy thirteen months ago, leading public heath officials heartily applauded. He was a fresh, dynamic young doctor who had distinguished himself by figuring out better ways to serve low-income patients in poor neighborhoods. But opposition quickly mounted outside the medical community. Republicans had held up his candidacy on two grounds. They said that at age 37, he was too young and inexperienced for the post. More importantly, they bowed to the National Rifle Association, which fiercely opposed Murthy because he had the temerity to say that guns are a public health issue. Republicans were wrong on both counts. The point is that the NRA remains an extraordinary force in our politics. As it whipped up opposition, a good number of Democratic senators, especially those up for re-election this past November, soon buckled to the NRA too. The White House continued to give Murthy quiet support but ducked a public fight. Murthy's nomination went into a tailspin and has seemed doomed since April. But then a strange thing happened -- by beginning debate on a point of order against Obama's immigration executive order, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz gave Majority Leader Harry Reid the opportunity to call a special session and put two dozen stalled Obama nominees on the agenda for confirmation before the Senate recessed. As a result, Murthy was confirmed Monday afternoon as the nineteenth U.S. Surgeon General Monday afternoon by a 51-43 vote. (Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk was the only Republican to vote in favor of Murthy.) Some months ago, one of us (David) had a chance to sit down with Murthy for a lengthy conversation about his background and his hopes as a possible surgeon general. We also explored his leadership capabilities with others in his generation (including David's daughter Katherine, who was his medical school classmate). What emerged was a portrait of a doctor who not only has the quantity of experience necessary but also the quality of experience. He is a lifelong advocate for reductions in health disparities, whose focus in the job will be on obesity, smoking, vaccinations and mental health -- pressing health concerns that often break down along racial and socioeconomic lines. Not only will he be excellent at managing imminent public health crises, but he also promises to be a solutions-oriented, data-driven leader on some of this country's most intractable health problems. As Dr. Paul Farmer, a Harvard University professor and founder of Partners in Health, has said: ""Dr. Vivek Murthy has long experience in community-based care, in communicating complex messages in a straightforward and even-handed manner, and is committed not just to passing on information to others, but to learning from them, too."" It is also important to recognize that Murthy has the resounding support of the medical community, having been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the American Cancer Society. As we saw with the Ebola crisis, the nation needs a strong public health leader to step into a post that's been vacant too long. Americans were, and remain, confused about quarantine requirements and how much risk Ebola poses. People didn't understand why government officials were not mandating quarantines for everyone who had been in contact with Ebola patients. This recent crisis highlights the need for a visible surgeon general who can educate the public during health emergencies. As opposed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, two agencies primarily concerned with academic research, the role of the surgeon general is to be the leading spokesperson on matters of public health in the United States -- ""the country's doctor,"" who can be trusted by rich and poor alike. The Ebola crisis demanded a public health official capable of leading in crisis, reassuring American families that they were safe and advocating for necessary precautions. The leadership vacuum is partly responsible for the government's initial bungling on Ebola and demonstrates just how important Murthy's confirmation is. If he goes down, the post could be vacant for another year or perhaps even two. The root of the NRA's opposition to Murthy, and the subsequent political maneuvering to stall his nomination, stems from an October 2012 tweet in which he wrote, ""Guns are a health care issue."" He was right -- guns are a public health issue. We once thought cigarettes were outside the purview of anything but the Food and Drug Administration but soon realized that they were a huge health issue. Guns are too, particularly when over 7,000 young people under age 20 are admitted to U.S. hospitals every year because of firearm injuries -- about 20 a day. It is entirely reasonable for the NRA to stand up for its beliefs in people's rights under the Second Amendment -- this country should always welcome robust debate about rights. But the gun lobby should not hold a veto power over what is best to protect the public health of our citizens. Doctors are right to speak out after treating so many gun victims in emergency rooms across the country. Primary care physicians are right to ask families if they have guns in their homes. A lot of young lives can be saved. It was especially fitting if the U.S. Senate were to approve Murthy on Monday, just a day after the second anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Note: An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect age for Vivek Murthy. This article has been updated.","David Gergen: Senate's vote to confirm Vivek Murthy a plus for public health .

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama's plan to take the immigration system in his own hands is a daring test of the limits of presidential power. The steps he will lay out tonight in a prime time address will fuel a debate over his use of executive authority to enact change without the agreement of an opposition Congress. Conservatives are howling that Obama's effort to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation oversteps his own authority and infringes the Constitution. His backers say he's simply exercising his power to select which areas of law to prioritize -- and addressing a major national issue that seems to elude Congress. The law, however, may be as murky as the immigration system itself. ""The issue is, if the president's actions effectively nullify federal law, then they are unconstitutional,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute. ""But if his actions merely channel enforcement resources to other areas covered under the law then it is within his discretion to do so."" He added: ""Drawing that line is a very difficult and murky process."" Republicans and legal critics warn that by dictating groups of illegal immigrants that will not be deported, Obama risks infringing a clause in the Constitution that requires him to ""take care"" that laws are faithfully executed. ""All the signals of what they are planning to do suggest that it is beyond the bounds of the take care clause,"" said Gregory Jacob, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush on immigration reform. Share your thoughts on the immigration debate . After Bush's own push for comprehensive immigration reform failed, he asked his legal team to examine his executive powers to change immigration policy. But they quickly concluded the kind of action Obama is now contemplating would go beyond presidential authority. ""The president is taking an entire chunk of the law and simply declining to enforce it,"" said Jacob. The Obama White House is pointing to legal precedents established by earlier presidents who have used executive power to reshape the immigration system, notably John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bush's father, George H.W. Bush. The elder Bush, for example, used executive power to permit 1.5 million undocumented spouses and children of people shielded from deportation by a previous law to also stay in the United States. White House officials point out that number accounted for about 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the country at the time. Obama could cover a similar proportion of the current total of 11.4 million illegal immigrants with the moves he's expected to announce. But lawyers who disagree with that view say Bush was using his power to fix problems with a recently passed immigration law — not acting alone after Congress refused to act. For his part, Reagan used executive power to help 100,000 families caught in a loophole included in a comprehensive immigration reform bill passed by Congress in 1986. He also offered relief to 200,000 Nicaraguan exiles. The Obama administration is adamant that the president is acting within his powers to implement laws already passed by Congress and to prioritize resources but officials won't reveal the legal reasoning until tonight's speech. Other Obama supporters were reluctant to speak publicly about the potential legal arguments ahead of the address. But in essence, the White House is expected to argue that Obama is simply wielding his constitutional powers to decide how laws are applied. The executive branch of the U.S. government decides all the time whether or not to pursue certain offenders in much the same way a police officer sometimes turns a blind eye toward a driver traveling at 58 mph in a 55 mph zone but choosing to pull over someone else doing 70. It's a concept known as prosecutorial discretion and Obama's supporters contend what he is doing is perfectly legal because he is directing U.S. law enforcement agencies where they should focus their attention. So, instead of seeking to deport the undocumented parents of American citizens, the president is expected to channel resources towards enforcing U.S. borders. Officials said he may also require U.S. authorities to spend more time seeking to deport felons or recently arrived illegal immigrants than those brought to America years ago as children . Obama has argued that acting in this way is in fact more consistent with his legal obligations and authorities as president. And he says he is not infringing his powers by changing the law because a new president could take office and wipe out his executive orders with the stroke of a pen. ""I can't wait in perpetuity when I have authorities that, at least for the next two years, can improve the system, can allow us to shift more resources to the border rather than separating families,"" he said last week. ""I would be derelict in my duties if I did not try to improve the system that everybody acknowledges is broken."" If Republicans do conclude that Obama has overstepped the  bounds of his office, what remedy do they have? Of course, they could pass legislation next year -- after they gain majorities in the House and Senate -- that would undo Obama's actions. But the president could then veto that legislation -- and it's unlikely that there will be enough support in Congress to overturn a veto. House Republicans are already taking the president to court alleging abuse of power over Obamacare. They could add a question on immigration to the case. But that would risk turning what is at root a political crisis into an unpredictable constitutional showdown. And courts are notoriously loath to inject themselves into a dispute between separate branches of government. Obama could find his actions challenged in other courts. But an organization wanting to sue the president might struggle to find someone hurt by his orders  — the legal term is ""standing"" — on whom to base a case. Other Republicans have even mentioned the ""i"" word — impeachment — but that's also fraught with political peril. The most realistic path may be for Republicans, who next year will control both chambers of Congress, to cut funding for Obama's executive actions. Or they can wait until 2016 and elect a president who might overturn Obama's executive order. The debate over Obama's authority is partially of his own making. No one has made the case against the course of action Obama is taking better than the former constitutional law professor who now sits in the Oval Office. Under pressure for years by Hispanic supporters to stem deportations, the president has repeatedly complained that he cannot just wave a magic wand and make things right. ""This notion that somehow, I can just change the laws unilaterally is not true ....  The fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce,"" he said in 2011. Obama has pointed out that he is not a ""king"" or an ""emperor"" — words now being used against him by opponents and spooling on a loop on television channels. ""Our president has a preternatural ability to stay one thing and then do another,"" Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said this week.","Obama will announce immigration changes tonight .
Obama is making the changes without Congress .
The moves could prompt a legal fight ."
"The first thing you notice is the smell: rich, deep, and mysterious. And somehow, both fresh and musty at the same time. It's a scent that immediately piques your curiosity. CNN's On the Road Japan team visited Japan's oldest whisky distillery just outside Kyoto to learn more about a spirit that's just been named the best in the world. Just a few weeks ago, the Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013, made by beverage giant Suntory, took home top honors in Jim Murray's ""Whisky Bible"".  The whisky guru referred to it as ""near indescribable genius."" Scotch didn't even make the top three. While Japanese whisky has been taking home awards for over a decade, this was a first.  And standing in the cellar piled high with oak casks, some American, some Spanish, and some Japanese, you get the sense that its rise around the globe has only just begun. Don't call it Scotch . Suntory's Chief Blender Shinji Fukuyo is responsible for every bottle of whisky  -- don't call it Scotch, he says -- that leaves the 90-year-old distillery. While the Scotland-trained Fukuyo is modest about taking home the top title, he is clearly proud of what Japanese whisky has achieved.  The secret, he says, is not boldness, but balance. Perhaps it's the purity of the water, which Fukuyo says makes a gentle spirit. Or maybe it's because the whisky is exposed to Japan's dry, cold winters and hot, humid summers as it matures inside those casks. Or maybe it's about the blending. ""The Scotch industry has more than 100 distilleries there, so blenders can choose from each distillery,"" Fukuyo points out. ""But we have only two malt distilleries, one grain distillery.  That's why we have to make different types of whisky even in one distillery.  It's our challenge."" Creating a perfect blend . Suntory's blender won't show us the secret behind his craft, but when we ask him how he maintains the quality he gives us a glimpse into the science. Formulas of the most popular labels can change up to two dozen times a year, Fukuyo says, because no two casks are exactly the same.  Change one ingredient in the blend and that precious balance is no more. It's a challenge that seems even more daunting when we learn some products use 15 or 20 different types of whisky.  Even single malt contains whisky from about ten casks, he says, although all from a single distillery to qualify for the single-malt moniker. A matter of taste . From blending, we're on to tasting. If you like your whisky neat, well, here's the first big surprise with Japanese whisky: add water.  Even if it's just a dash. Fukuyo says adding water is a must in order to release the aromas and savor the full flavors. That's because most Japanese enjoy drinking whisky with a meal, sometimes on the rocks, sometimes in a highball glass with soda. So once in the glass, the whisky has to hold its character and flavor, even while the proof begins to drop. Fukuyo confesses he drinks it straight, but definitely not without a drop or two of water to open it up. As for that best-in-the-world whisky? You can't get it in Japan, Fukuyo says. Only 3,000 bottles were released, and they were all exported. Whisky culture . While Japanese whisky is making headlines, whisky culture in the country is distinctly low-key. Many whisky bars are small with only a dozen or so seats and a solitary bartender. Takayuki Suzuki, the cocktail designer at the Park Hotel Tokyo, gives us a first-hand look at Japanese whisky bar-tending skills. Suzuki's nickname is ""Mr. Ice Man,"" and we soon learn why when he sets to work transforming a rough, softball-sized block of ice into a smooth sphere. Fragments fly in every direction as Suzuki chips away, before he spins his handiwork into a lowball glass, pours single malt whisky over the top and then carefully lifts the cube twice with a spoon to release the aromas. ""Japanese whisky has a good balance,"" Suzuki says. ""Compared with Scotch whisky, it does not lose the taste and flavor when you mix it with other drinks. It is easy to use as a cocktail base."" So we ask for an Old Fashioned. And he just looks at us. A different bartender might raise an eyebrow, but Suzuki is far too polite. Which Japanese whisky would be best for that, we ask.  The answer, it turns out, is none.  According to Suzuki, mixing the spirits with anything but ice, water or soda, would ruin its purity and balance.  But he says of course he'll make one if the customer really wants it. We've learned our lesson.  Another 12-year Yamazaki on the ""rock,"" please.  It's time to relax and enjoy.

"Judy Gross says she doesn't know how much longer her husband can make it. But she's scared it won't be long. ""Alan is resolved that he will not endure another year imprisoned in Cuba, and I am afraid that we are at the end,"" she said in a statement released Wednesday. Her comments come on the five-year anniversary of the day when Cuban authorities arrested her husband, Alan Gross, who'd been working as a subcontractor the U.S. Agency for International Development. Alan Gross, 65, is serving a 15-year sentence for bringing satellite communications equipment to Cuba as part of his work as a State Department subcontractor. He was convicted in March 2011. ""After five years of literally wasting away, Alan is done,"" Judy Gross said. ""It is time for President Obama to bring Alan back to the United States now; otherwise it will be too late."" The Cuban government has called for a prisoner swap: Gross for three imprisoned Cuban intelligence agents serving lengthy federal prison sentences in the United States. But the U.S. State Department has nixed that idea, saying Gross was an aid worker merely trying to help Cuba's small Jewish community get online despite Cuban government restrictions on Internet access. Frustrated by the diplomatic impasse, Gross has threatened to kill himself if he isn't freed soon. In July, he said goodbye to his wife and daughter and has refused to see them again while he's imprisoned. He's also refused to meet with U.S. diplomats in Havana in protest over the slow progress to free him. On Wednesday, his family warned that his health is deteriorating. He's lost more than 100 pounds, he can barely walk because of chronic pain and he has lost five teeth and much of the sight in his right eye, the family's statement said. The State Department renewed calls for his release on Tuesday, decrying his ""unjustified imprisonment in difficult conditions in Cuba."" ""It is gravely disappointing, especially in light of its professed goal of providing Cubans with Internet access, that the Cuban government has not allowed Mr. Gross to return to his family, where he belongs,"" the State Department said. ""We reiterate our call on the Cuban government, echoing foreign leaders and even Cuba's allies, to release Alan Gross immediately."" Last month, U.S. Sens. Jeff Flake and Tom Udall traveled to Cuba to push for the former State Department contractor's release, calling his imprisonment an impediment to improving U.S. relations with the island nation. Gross was arrested in 2009, accused of smuggling in the banned communications equipment. U.S. officials said Gross was merely trying to help Cubans bypass the island's stringent restrictions on Internet access. But Cuban authorities say Gross was part of a plot to create ""a Cuban spring"" and destabilize the island's single-party communist government.

"Congressional Republicans are vowing to fight President Barack Obama's plan to make immigration changes through executive action, but they are struggling with how to do that without triggering another government shutdown. The House and Senate need to pass a measure during the lame duck session to fund federal agencies, which will run out of money in mid-December. House conservatives are pressing Speaker John Boehner to attach language to the spending bill that would block any money for federal agencies to give out any new visas or green cards. But House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, who is crafting a yearlong so-called ""omnibus"" spending measure, warned that effort could trigger a shutdown, and insisted no one wants to go down that road. ""There's no one stronger than me against unilateral action by the President on this subject, however it's been said before - don't take a hostage you can't shoot,"" Rogers told reporters after a meeting with all House Republicans on Thursday. The debate over how to confront Obama is posing a sudden challenge for Republican leaders fresh off their victories during last week's midterm elections, which gave them control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in nearly a decade. A day after the election, Mitch McConnell, who will become Senate majority leader in January, said Republicans would take positions Obama wouldn't like but pledged not to shut down the government. Obama, who is traveling in Asia this week, has said he remains committed to using his executive authority to address immigration by the end of the year but the precise timing isn't clear. White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters in Myanmar that Obama is ""nearing a final decision."" Boehner told members at Thursday meeting that one of his top priorities is to use every tool available to him to stop any effort by the president to go around Congress on immigration, according to several Republicans who attended.  But the Speaker also said he doesn't want a shutdown, and he cautioned members that they need to game out a smart way to respond before they move forward with a vote. At an afternoon press conference, Boehner pledged to ""fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path."" He said no decisions were made and GOP leaders were considering various ways to block the action, but did not rule out waging the fight on the spending bill. ""All options are on the table,"" he said. Arizona Republican Rep. Matt Salmon, who drafted a letter signed by more than 50 House GOP members to Rogers, told reporters he's not pushing for a shutdown, but leaders shouldn't rule out any options. ""It's really tragic that before we even fight a fight, or even stake a claim that we're throwing in the towel.  I just don't think that's the way to operate.  We don't have to talk about ultimatum scenarios at this point in time,"" Salmon told reporters after the meeting. Salmon argued that after the midterm elections Republicans have a mandate to push back at the president, and they should use their legislative authority to curb his executive actions. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid supports Obama's effort to address immigration but has privately conveyed concerns to the White House that an executive action could threaten passage of the spending bill. ""The President has said he'll do the executive action, the question is when,"" Reid told CNN in a hallway interview in the Capitol. ""He can do it, you know, it's up to him. But I'd like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it. But it's up to him."" Several Republicans told CNN the memory of last year's shutdown and the damage it inflicted on the GOP brand is fresh enough that members are willing to give the Speaker some time to decide what approach to take.  A vote on a spending bill is not expected on the House floor until early December. What's complicating the next move for Boehner and other congressional Republican leaders is no one knows the details yet on the timing or scope of what the President will do. Even if House Republicans have the votes to pass something as part of a spending bill, any measure that blocks the president from using his own authority will be blocked in the Senate, which is still controlled by Democrats, or vetoed by the president.  That leaves the clock ticking before the government runs out of money on December 11th. One option GOP leaders are considering is passing a short term spending bill -one lasting a few weeks even -  that would avoid a shutdown and give them more time to decide how to respond to the President after he rolls out his plan, which is expected by the end of the year. Another is to expand the lawsuit against President Obama that House Republicans already approved to challenge his authority to implement Obamacare.  Although the House voted to sue the president in July, the formal legal paperwork hasn't been filed with the courts yet. Whether leaders decide to challenge the president as part of a spending bill or later, it's clear that conservatives are bracing for a major confrontation with the president over his plans to allow potentially millions of undocumented workers to remain in the U.S. ""I trust him completely to do the worst left wing, twisted policy that he can come up with"" Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks told CNN.","Reid has privately conveyed concerns to the White House .
Republicans are debating how to confront Obama over immigration .
Some GOP lawmakers say leaders shouldn't rule out a shutdown .

"Turkish police on Sunday arrested senior journalists, media executives and even the scriptwriter for a popular television series on charges of ""forming, leading and being a member of an armed terrorist organization."" The more than two dozen arrests followed another series of police raids on December 17 of last year, in which prominent supporters of the government, including the sons of ministers and the head of a state-owned bank, were interrogated on charges of corruption. In almost all cases, those year-old charges have been dropped. The current crop of detentions are people associated with the influential Gulen religious movement and whose followers have an active network of schools and businesses. The government accuses the movement of infiltrating the police and judiciary. Among those now detained are Ekrem Dumanli, editor-in-chief of Zaman, the country's widest circulating newspaper. Police arriving at 7.30 a.m. were greeted by scores of protesters shouting ""a free media cannot be silenced."" Journalists and Gulen supporters had mounted a vigil after tweets from ""Fuatavni"" -- a reliable but anonymous source -- had warned of the raid. Police retreated only to reappear in the afternoon when Dumanli gave himself up voluntarily. Also in custody are Hidayet Karaca, the head of the Gulen-affiliated Samanyolu television, as well as the director, producers and writer of long-running political soap operas that cast aspersions on the government's attempt to broker a deal with Kurdish militants by depicting it as a conspiracy hatched in the corridors of Tehran. For the past year, the government has been waging a campaign against the Islamic spiritual leader Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. In the pro-government press, even the word Pennsylvania has become synonymous with a conspiracy to create what is called a ""parallel"" state by overthrowing the elected government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, former Prime Minister and now President. The Gulen-affiliated movement counters that these accusations are simply a smokescreen to cover up corruption in high places, including the president's own family. For the past 12 months, suspected Gulenists in the bureaucracy have been let go from key positions and laws enacted that will shut down a chain of university tutorial colleges affiliated to the movement. ""Whether driven by a desire to shift public attention from the anniversary of corruption probes, or by public criticisms of systematic nepotism and excesses of the presidential palace, these raids and arrests are politically motivated,"" the Alliance for Shared Values, an organization that represents U.S. groups affiliated with the Gulen movement, said in a statement. ""Such actions taint Turkey's image around the world and raise the growing authoritarianism of the Erdogan regime to a new level."" Until recently, the Gulen movement had been among Erdogan's most enthusiastic supporters. The Zaman media group was a cheerleader of a series of trials that involved scores of military officers convicted of trying to stage a coup d'état.  Journalists critical of the Gulenists' political ambitions also stood trial, including the freelance writer Ahmet Sik, who spent  2011-2012 in prison awaiting trial. Sik has refused to have his revenge eaten cold. While the Gulen community may have ""served fascism a few years ago, what happened to them is also fascism,"" he tweeted at the news of Sunday's raid. Indeed many observers see the crackdown as a growing example of Erdogan's  increasing authoritarian rule. ""These arrests appear to be government retribution against journalists reporting on corruption and criticizing the government. The crackdown on speech in Turkey must end, said Daniel Calingaert, executive vice president of Freedom House, the Washington-based democracy watchdog that this year downgraded the Turkish press from being ""partly free"" to ""not free."" ""The situation changes when people ... try to take control of the bureaucracy and thus declare war against the country's elected government,"" said Ahmet Davutoglu, Erdogan's successor as Prime Minister. A statement by the U.S. State Department last week cautioned Turkey, a key NATO ally, not to violate its ""own democratic foundations"" while drawing attention to raids against media outlets ""openly critical of the current Turkish government.""","""These raids and arrests are politically motivated,"" group says .

"An American who said he crossed illegally into North Korea denounced the United States political and economic system Sunday morning at a press conference in that country. The man said he was Arturo Pierre Martinez, 29,  a U.S. citizen raised in El Paso, Texas. Martinez's mother, Patricia Eugenia Martinez of El Paso, said their son was bipolar and earlier tried to enter North Korea by swimming across a river, only to be stopped and shipped back to the United States, where he was placed in a California psychiatric hospital. ""Then he got out,"" she said. ""He is very smart and he got the court to let him out and instead of coming home to us he bought a ticket and left for China. He took out a payday loan online and left for China."" She said the U.S. Embassy in Beijing is looking for him. ""My son is very intelligent,"" she said. ""He said he wanted to protect Latinos and he worried about the world and about people. At 15 he obtained his computer certificate. He loves to read and write and work on the computer. He loved to help poor people. He is our only child."" Later she released a statement that said: ""I'm glad and relieved that my son is safe. I am appreciative to the North Korean authorities for pardoning my son and releasing him. I look forward to spending Christmas with him after they release him."" When asked how she knew her son was being released, she said it was from reading the press conference statement. But the legal status of Martinez in North Korea is unclear and it's unknown if he's free to leave the country. In his 4,000-word statement, Martinez admitted committing a crime by illegally entering the country but said he was ""extremely grateful for having been pardoned from the punishments given to violators of these laws, and for the most generous reception I have received."" He delivered his statement at a press conference he said he requested. Images released by North Korea showed him wearing a suit and sitting in a room facing a large group of people. North Korea said in a separate statement that Martinez entered the country in November, two days after American diplomat James Clapper arrived. Clapper negotiated the release of Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller, the last two American citizens known to be held by North Korea. They arrived back in the United States on November 8. Martinez said he first tried to cross over from South Korea's Han River and tried again from China's Yalu River in Dandong. He went on to criticize American politicians and police as well as the electoral and prison systems. ""The illegal war carried out against the nation of Iraq serves as a perfect example of how the U.S. government acts much like a Mafia enterprise, but criminally plundering entire nations of their resources, strategic reserves and economies instead of smaller scale business and individuals, and does so without a code of ethics,"" he said. He said the electoral system in the United States ""is unfairly built for the benefit of the wealthy through the necessity of costly fundraising for political candidates seeking office. The democracy of this nation is an illusion and its representatives act as nothing more than power brokers for those who can offer them."" Of the wealthy people in the United States, he said, ""These billionaires in power are nothing short of sociopathic megalomaniacs on the path to absolute world domination."" He also talked about unidentified flying objects, CIA involvement in the cocaine trade, ""ultrasonic"" devices that cause people to hear voices and experience bodily discomfort and how the Western news media unfairly portrayed North Korea.","The man is identified as Arturo Pierre Martinez, 29, of El Paso, Texas .

"Darren Wilson's version of what happened when he confronted Michael Brown has expanded since he gave his first recorded interview to detectives, but the key parts have stayed largely the same. Witnesses corroborated and disputed what Wilson said about events leading up to the police officer's fatal shooting of the unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9. Much of the crime scene evidence supports Wilson's story, but there are also some key differences, according to an analysis of available material. Wilson spent 31 minutes being interviewed by police the day after the shooting, about four hours in front of the grand jury, and another 45 minutes talking to George Stephanopoulos of ABC. The police interview was largely procedural -- what happened when -- while his answers to the grand jury got more into description and motives. To ABC, he added a few key points and revised an unfavorable view of the Ferguson neighborhood where he shot and killed Brown. The police interview from the day after the shooting and the grand jury testimony were released as part of court records for a case that was closed on Monday when the grand jury decided there was no probable cause to indict Wilson in Brown's death. There were other interviews with law enforcement -- on the day of the shooting to local detectives and weeks later to the FBI -- that have not been released. Wilson's story always starts the same way. It had been a quiet shift when he responded to a 911 call to help a sick baby. Medical staff arrived to treat the infant and as he was heading back to his police car on Canfield Drive, he heard a call of a theft in progress, with a description of what he said was a black male in a black T-shirt. He called out on the radio to the other officers involved, ""Do you guys need me?"" but got no response. Black T-shirt, cigarillos . The black T-shirt that Wilson mentioned in both his police and grand jury interviews was key. After Brown reacted so strongly to Wilson's instruction to walk on the sidewalk, Wilson said he took a good look at him and saw he was carrying cigarillos, the item that had been reported to have been stolen just minutes earlier. Wilson then looked in his mirror at Brown's friend Dorian Johnson and when he saw he was wearing a black T-shirt, he put two and two together. ""That's when it clicked for me because I now saw the cigarillos. I looked in my mirror, did a double-check that Johnson was wearing a black shirt -- these are the two from the stealing,"" he told the grand jury, echoing his police interview. The call logs from the Ferguson police dispatch -- also released as part of the grand jury records -- do show that a ""stealing in progress"" was reported by the dispatcher. But the suspect was mentioned as being a black male in a white shirt who took a whole box of Swisher brand cigarillos. Minutes later, an officer came on the radio with more of a description -- one that pretty closely matched Michael Brown that day: ""He's with another male. He's got a red Cardinals hat, white T-shirt, yellow socks, and khaki short."" We don't know if there was any separate alert about a man in a black T-shirt. The struggle at the car . Wilson said the identification of Johnson and Brown as suspects was what led him to reverse his car back to the pair. To the grand jury, he elaborated that he angled his car ""to kind of cut them off, kind to keep them somewhat contained."" That's when the confrontation with Brown began -- the slamming of the car door, the fight as Wilson was inside the car, a shot fired, then another. Brown's blood and skin tissue inside the car, a close-range gunshot wound to the base of his right thumb, and two bullet casings found near Wilson's car support at least that there was a struggle over Wilson's gun. Wilson told the detectives how he ran through in his mind what he could do -- mace, baton, flashlight -- before going for his gun. To the grand jury, he expanded, describing a ""use of force"" triangle as to what reaction was appropriate. To the grand jury, Wilson also described his fear. He told jurors Brown was so powerful that when he grabbed the 18-year-old's forearm, ""I felt like a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan."" He also used that analogy to ABC. Later, he told Stephanopoulos that he was also asking himself how the situation could have escalated so quickly. And then Brown ran. Crime scene evidence shows he lost his baseball cap at the car, then first his left sandal and then his right as he ran down Canfield Drive. Wilson didn't address with the detectives why he got out of the car. To the grand jury, he said he had lost his ""comfort zone"" in the car. ""I wanted to be out of the car, that way if I need to run I can run,"" he said. He continued: ""But I also didn't want him to run away, so I need to kind of stay where I can keep him there, keep myself safe and wait for someone to get there."" ABC's Stephanopoulos also asked why he got out and Wilson agreed it was his duty. ""That's what we were trained to do,"" he said. What shell casings show, and what they don't . Wilson also told ABC he ran through a mental checklist to determine whether he had the legal right to shoot Brown and decided that he did. It's impossible to tell from the 10 shell casings found farther down the road exactly how many shots were fired and when, or where Brown and Wilson were in relation to each other. But some of the casings were found farther from the car than Brown's body, suggesting that the men did head some distance east before Brown turned and headed west again, with Wilson backing up. The autopsy showed no bullets hit Brown's back. The fatal shot hit Brown in the head from a downward direction as he bent down or was falling. Wilson said Brown fell on his face after the fatal shot. He added that Brown had been moving with such momentum that his feet came up into the air before coming to rest on the ground. Abrasions were noted by the county and family-hired pathologists, and the family-hired pathologist concluded ""the most likely cause"" for the wounds would be that Brown lost consciousness and his face would have been unprotected when he hit the roadway. Where were Brown's hands? To both detectives and grand jurors, Wilson said that as Brown charged at him, Brown balled his left hand into a fist and put his right hand in the waistband of his shorts. That hand stayed in the waistband throughout the encounter, he said. He told the St. Louis County detectives: ""During his first stride, he took his right hand put it under his shirt and into his waistband. And I ordered him to stop and get on the ground again. He didn't; I fired, a, multiple shots. After I fired the multiple shots I paused for a second, yelled at him to get on the ground again, he was still in the same state. Still charging, hands still in his waistband, hadn't slowed down. I fired another set of shots. Same thing, still running at me, hadn't slowed down, hands still in his waistband."" When Brown was 8 to 10 feet away, Wilson fired at his head -- the fatal shot. And Wilson said the arm had not moved. ""When he went down his hand was still under his, his right hand was still under his body looked like it was still in his waistband. I never touched him,"" he told detectives. The investigator from the Office of the Medical Examiner sent to the crime scene took no photographs, telling the grand jury later that the battery in his camera had died. And CNN could find no photographs of the body in the materials released by the prosecuting attorney. But the medical investigator did describe how the body was lying. One arm was indeed near Brown's waist. But it was the left, not the right. ""The deceased was lying in the prone position. His right arm was extended away from his side. His left arm was next to his side his lower arm was beneath his abdomen and his hand was near the waistband of his shorts."" Wilson used his interview with ABC to revise what he'd said about Ferguson and the Canfield Green area. While he told the grand jury it was a ""hostile environment"" and ""anti-police,"" he told Stephanopoulos he was sad about the riots that hit Brown's Ferguson neighborhood after the grand jury decision was revealed. ""That community is really a great community."" And while he stood by all his actions, Wilson added one more sentiment in the ABC interview that he hadn't been asked about by the detectives or in the grand jury -- remorse. ""Everyone feels remorse when a life is lost. ... I never wanted to take anybody's life,"" he said.","Three interviews with Darren Wilson are now public .

"After pleading guilty to a judge Tuesday on a felony tax evasion charge, New York Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican, pledged to reporters he would also stay in Congress. Grimm pled guilty in court to one count of tax evasion and was set to submit to a ""statement of facts"" that admits to all the conduct alleged in the 20-count federal indictment. A statement from federal prosecutors in New York released on Tuesday after Grimm's court appearance noted that in addition to the tax evasion plea, Grimm also publicly admitted to hiring undocumented workers, lying under oath while serving in Congress, obstructing federal and state officials, and cheating employees out of employment insurance claims. FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Venizelos stated, ""The public expects their elected officials at all levels of government to behave honorably, or at a minimum, lawfully.  As his guilty plea demonstrates, Grimm put self-interest above public service."" Grimm apologized for his actions and took responsibility, but said the unpaid taxes from a New York restaurant he once owned were all a big mistake. ""As long as I'm able to serve I'm going to serve,"" Grimm said. Reelected in November, he was is set to be sworn in to a new term in January. Prosecutors asked a judge to sentence Grimm on June 8th to 24 to 36 months of jail time. His defense team suggested 12 - 18 months. Can a Congressman serve from behind bars? If recent history is any guide it's unlikely that Grimm will serve out his third term that starts in January even though there is nothing in the Constitution or House Rules against felons serving in Congress. There isn't much historical precedent for it either, although one Congressman in the 1990s, Republican Jay Kim, shuffled around Capitol Hill wearing an ankle bracelet after he was convicted of 10 misdemeanors. Grimm's felony plea is a more serious matter. While Grimm said Tuesday he has talked to House leadership about his situation, he has not yet spoken with House Speaker John Boehner and Boehner has not publicly weighed in on whether Grimm should step down. But Boehner has made it clear during his time in leadership that he has little patience for those members admitting to any wrongdoing. ""We won't have any announcements until the Speaker discusses the matter with Mr. Grimm,"" said Boehner's spokesman Michael Steel. Calls for Grimm to resign are sure to mount and GOP leaders would prefer not to deal with questions about a felon remaining in the Republican conference when they open up the new session in 2015. In previous cases where House Republicans admitted to ethical lapses -- criminal or personal -- Boehner has worked privately to encourage scandal plagued members to step aside on their own. Former Florida GOP Rep. Trey Radel, who pled guilty to cocaine possession last year, initially sought treatment for drug addiction, but resigned two months later.  When half naked pictures surfaced online of Rep. Chris Lee of New York soliciting an encounter with a woman on Craigslist he quickly stepped down.  Indiana Republican Mark Souder resigned his seat one day after admitting he had an affair with an aide. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called Tuesday on Boehner ""to insist that Congressman Grimm resign immediately."" Democrats were frustrated they were unable to defeat Grimm in November's midterm election, even with the 20-count federal indictment hanging over him.  He also grabbed national headlines last January for threatening to toss a reporter over a balcony on Capitol Hill after being asked about the allegations. If Grimm does eventually decide to resign, Democrats have a good chance to pick up that seat in a special election.  A spokesman for the House Democrats' campaign arm is already accusing Boehner of covering up for Grimm. ""After Speaker Boehner abetted Grimm's lies to voters about his guilt in this past election, he owes it to the constituents and the Congress to make sure Michael Grimm doesn't serve in this next Congress,"" Josh Scherwin, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But a senior House Republican leadership aide points out that Pelosi has not forced out those Democrats who faced ethics investigations. ""After standing behind Reps. Bill Jefferson, Charlie Rangel, Jack Murtha, and many others, Rep. Pelosi has zero credibility of these issues,"" the aide told CNN. Jefferson's trial drug out on Capitol Hill and for a time pitted House leaders from both parties against the Justice Department, which wanted to raid his office after they found $100,000 found in his home freezer. It took some time before Pelosi and Democrats stripped Jefferson of his powerful post on the tax writing committee. He ultimately lost a bid for reelection and is serving a 13-year sentence for bribery. While Murtha and Rangel faced ethics inquiries, neither was indicted for criminal wrongdoing. Rangel was censured by his colleagues in the House for ethics violations, including failing to pay taxes, but continues to serve in Congress. Murtha, who was a top Pelosi soldier, died in 2010 while still in office. If Grimm wants to remain in Congress he'll likely face some type of punishment handed down from the House Ethics Committee, a process that could drag out for months. The panel deferred its review at the request of the Department of Justice, and under its rules will have to vote to renew its investigation when the next session begins in January. The committee declined to comment to CNN on the Grimm case. Grimm has already given up his seat on the House Financial Services Committee, but depending on his sentence he could be forced under House ethics rules to also refrain from voting on the House floor. If the Ethics committee votes that Rep Grimm's actions broke House rules he could face punishments ranging from reprimand - the mildest public condemnation -to censure or expulsion.  The last time the House voted to expel a member was in 2002, after Democratic Rep Jim Traficant was convicted of bribery and tax evasion charges. The House has only expelled five members in its entire history. Three of those were during the Civil War era for disloyalty. Another, Rep. Michael (Ozzy) Myers of Pennsylvania was expelled in 1980 after a bribery conviction.","New York Rep. Michael Grimm pled guilty to tax evasion but said he would remain in Congress .

"A 29-year-old mother was fatally shot Tuesday in an Idaho Walmart when her 2-year-old son in the shopping cart grabbed a gun that was in her purse and shot her in an apparent accident, authorities said. Detectives were investigating the scene and Walmart officials immediately shuttered the store in Hayden, said the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office. The mother was identified by the sheriff's office as Veronica J. Rutledge of Blackfoot. At the time, the mother and son were shopping with other family members, authorities said. ""The shooting appears to be accidental,"" said a statement by Sheriff Ben Wolfinger and Lt. Stu Miller. At a press conference, Miller said the mother was shopping at the back of the store in the electronics department. ""It appears that the victim brought several of her children here to do some shopping after the holidays,"" Miller told reporters in the parking lot. ""The child looks like to be sitting in the shopping cart with the purse while the female victim was shopping."" ""Here it is around the holidays, just after Christmas and right before the New Year -- tragic, tragic accident,"" Miller said. ""It's not a pleasant experience right now."" The shooting occurred about 10:20 a.m. ""A very sad incident happened in our store in Hayden, Idaho, that involved a female customer,"" said Walmart spokesperson Brooke Buchanan.

"Washington (CNN)Rep. Michael Grimm announced late Monday night plans to resign from Congress, after pleading guilty to a felony tax evasion charge last week. The announcement came just hours after a source familiar with Grimm's thinking told CNN he would resign ""sooner rather than later,"" after the New York Daily News broke the news of Grimm's plans to step down. ""After much thought and prayer, I have made the very difficult decision to step down from Congress effective January 5th, 2015. This decision is made with a heavy heart, as I have enjoyed a very special relationship and closeness with my constituents, whom I care about deeply,"" Grimm said in a statement issued shortly before midnight by his office. The Staten Island congressman was indicted in April on 20 counts relating to his health food restaurant, Healthalicious, including charges that he filed false tax returns; engaged in mail fraud, wire fraud and perjury; and knowingly hired undocumented workers. House Speaker John Boehner called Grimm's decision to step down ""honorable"" in a statement on Tuesday. ""I know it was made with the best interests of his constituents and the institution in mind, and I appreciate his years of service in the House,"" Boehner said. A Republican congressional source said Boehner and Grimm spoke Monday before Grimm announced his plans to resign. During last Tuesday's hearing, Grimm pleaded guilty to one count of aiding in the filing of a false tax return, a plea that's expected to bring him months of jail time. In the statement announcing his plans to resign, Grimm said that ""the events which led to this day did not break my spirit, nor the will of the voters,"" but that he feels he won't be able to serve effectively in the new Congress. ""However, I do not believe that I can continue to be 100% effective in the next Congress, and therefore, out of respect for the Office and the people I so proudly represent, it is time for me to start the next chapter of my life,"" he said. The decision to resign marks a change of heart for the Staten Island Republican, who rejected calls to step down after he entered his guilty plea. He apologized for his actions and took responsibility, and said that the unpaid taxes from a New York restaurant he once owned were a mistake. ""As long as I'm able to serve I'm going to serve,"" he said. Grimm was re-elected in November and was to be sworn in to a new term in January. While there's nothing in the Constitution or House Rules barring felons from serving in Congress, the situation created an unwanted headache and negative attention for Boehner as he seeks to head into the new Congress starting with a clean slate. While he gave up his seat on the House Financial Services Committee after he was charged, Grimm repeatedly insisted he would be ""fully exonerated."" According to the Daily News, however, Grimm admitted to the conduct alleged in his 20-count indictment in a document to the court. The indictment came down just months before what was already expected to be a tough re-election fight for the perennial Democratic target. His Staten Island-area district went for President Barack Obama in 2012, but despite the cloud of the indictment hanging over his head, Grimm pulled out an easy win over his Democratic challenger in November. His re-election and subsequent guilty plea created problems for Boehner, who — along with then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor — in 2010 promised to institute a ""zero tolerance"" policy for ethics violations within the GOP caucus, which had dogged the party and contributed to its steep losses in the 2006 and 2008 elections. Indeed, in previous situations where House Republicans admitted to criminal or personal ethical lapses, Boehner has worked privately to encourage those members to step aside on their own. But Grimm's guilty plea wasn't the only headache he's caused Boehner over the past year. He drew negative headlines last January when he was caught on camera threatening to throw a reporter off a balcony and break him in half ""like a boy,"" after the reporter asked about an investigation into his campaign finances. Grimm's resignation will spark a competitive special election for his seat, and potential contenders have already begun lining up. Former Democratic Rep. Michael McMahon, who narrowly lost to Grimm in 2010, has reportedly expressed interest in a bid for his old seat. Republican candidates, according to the Daily News, could include Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis and state Sen. Andrew Lanza. CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","Rep. Michael Grimm will resign effective Jan. 5, he announced Monday night .

"Pentagon officials are readying a plan that would deploy U.S. military advisers to the volatile Iraqi province of Anbar to advise and assist Iraqi security forces in a region currently dominated by ISIS militants. ""To be clear, this is not a change in mission nor is it a combat role, as they will be operating in the same advisory role as the other locations,"" Col. Edward Thomas, spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told CNN. U.S. advisers currently operate in areas around Baghdad and Irbil in the north of the country. The new proposal would put U.S. troops in the middle of some of the most violent situations in Iraq. Thomas said the plan is still ""under development."" ""From the beginning of the campaign, we have said that we would expand this type of support to the Iraqi government should they act in a manner that was representative of the security interests of all Iraqis,"" Thomas said. U.S. officials maintain that Iraqi support for Sunni tribes going on the offensive against ISIS will be a necessary part in the effort to defeat the militants, who are also called ISIL and refer to themselves as the Islamic State. In a news conference with reporters Thursday, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Joint Chiefs chairman, signaled the possibility of the new role when he said the Iraqi government had not yet requested U.S. military support in efforts to defend a Sunni tribe that has suffered mass executions at the hands of ISIS militants. ""That's why we need to expand the train-advise-and-assist mission into the Al- Anbar Province,"" Dempsey said. ""But the precondition for that is that the government of Iraq is willing to arm the tribes."" Dempsey said the United States had ""positive indications"" the Iraqi government was prepared to do that, but had not yet acted. Thomas said such a mission would hopefully open the door to the establishment of an Iraqi National Guard while also helping to push back ISIS control of the province. There is no indication from Pentagon officials on when such a mission could begin. Anbar was the scene of a bloody insurgency during the U.S.-led war in Iraq until an uprising by Sunni tribes in 2006 took hold to push out forces from al Qaeda's franchise in Iraq -- the precursor organization to ISIS. Some 400 members of the Sunni Abu Nimer tribe in Anbar have been killed in recent days after rising up against ISIS rule in the province.","Joint Chiefs spokesman says plan ""is not a change in mission nor is it a combat role""

"Read this story in Spanish at CNN Espanol. (CNN Espanol)In a world first, a court in Argentina issued a historic and unprecedented ruling that favors the rights of an orangutan held in captivity. Sandra the orangutan was granted a legal action so she may be transferred to a habitat in keeping with her development. Argentina's Association of Professional Lawyers for Animal Rights filed a writ of habeas corpus, a resource to avoid arbitrary arrests, on Sandra's behalf. Once the release and transfer order is issued, the orangutan would be taken to a sanctuary in Brazil, where she would live under partial or controlled freedom. Sandra, who has been living in captivity for the past 20 years at the Buenos Aires Zoo, was considered a ""nonhuman being"" and she was granted basic rights, such as life, freedom and a premise of ""no harm"" either physically or psychologically. Argentina's Federal Chamber of Criminal Cassation ruled the primate is a subject of law, ""a nonhuman being that has certain rights, and can enforce them through legal procedure,"" according to Andrés Gil Domínguez, Sandra's attorney. ""This is an unprecedented ruling, the first ruling worldwide,"" said the lawyer. Previously, Argentine laws interpreted animals as things. Buenos Aires Zoo officials did not issue a statement but will have up to two weeks to appeal the ruling. Even though this is a case that sets a global precedent, specialists in this matter confirmed this type of ruling only applies to cases like Sandra's and great apes, who share 96% of their genetic identity with human beings. Science considers chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans to have understanding and feelings that can be compared with those of humans. ""It has been proven that Sandra and primates held in captivity have not only lost their freedom, they have lost the ability to live in a natural habitat, but it has also been proven that they are affected, that they suffer from confinement, and it is damage that is deep and serious,"" said Gil. Some animal rights activists interpret this ruling as opening new perspectives for species in captivity. For Pia Pacheco, from the NGO Project Gran Simio Argentina, this case is ""a reflection of certain changes that are taking place in our country in matters related to the consideration people have towards animals and the future they may have.""","An animal rights group files a writ asking for freedom for Argentine orangutan Sandra .

"By the time we depart Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, we will have spent 36 hours on the ground.  Like Edward Snowden, whose exact location here in the transit lounge remains a mystery, we cannot step foot on Russian soil without special visa clearance.

As it turns out, this airport has an expansive area for transiting passengers and we now know nearly every corner of it. Read more: Dozens of journalists heading for Cuba ... without Snowden . Snowden and those who are reportedly handling him are here, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

That statement came after we'd already landed on the ground in Sheremetyevo. It piqued global interest in the story. Putin broke his silence on Snowden, after leaving initial diplomacy to his seasoned Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Legally, Moscow has taken the view that Snowden has not cleared passport control, therefore is not on Russian soil. Read more: 4 options for the U.S. to get Snowden back .

Around us, passengers come and go to places such as Almaty, Amsterdam, Split, Tallinn and Vienna. We, of course, take particular interest in Aeroflot flight number 150, which is bound for Havana.

"Senate Democrats are wrapping up their tenure in the majority by reigniting debate on some of the former President's most controversial policies with a long-delayed report on the use of torture - ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" - by the U.S. government. Six years into the Barack Obama's presidency, the Senate Intelligence Committee early next week is expected to release findings from its $50 million investigation of the Central Intelligence Agency's use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques on detainees in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Among the questions the report tackles: Did three detainees tortured under the program provide information that helped identify a courier who led the U.S. to find Osama bin Laden? The answer to that question will likely be different based on already hardened points of view even after the Senate report is released. The CIA believes the interrogations of three men: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ammar al-Baluchi, and Hassan Ghul provided key information that led to bin Laden. Related: Military orders security review ahead of torture report release . More than a hundred detainees went through the CIA's detention program, and about a third were subjected to ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" which included waterboarding, exposure to cold temperatures, slapping and sleep deprivation. Three were waterboarded, which is considered the harshest of the techniques. The agency now disavows the program as a mistake that it won't repeat. Related: ""We tortured some folks, says President Obama"" But they are also trying to walk a fine line, by sticking to claims that valuable intelligence on al Qaeda and in the hunt for Osama bin Laden emerged from the harsh interrogations of detainees. CNN's Candy Crowley asked former President George W. Bush about the report in an interview set to air on State of the Union Sunday. ""I'll tell you this,"" Bush said after clarifying that he hadn't read the Senate report yet.  ""We're fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the CIA serving on our behalf.  These are patriots.  And whatever the report says, if it diminishes their contributions to our country it is way off base.  I knew the directors, the deputy directors, I knew a lot of the operators.  These are good people.  Really good people. And we're lucky as a nation to have them."" Officials briefed on the report say it will provide ugly new details on the CIA program, including specifics on detainee deaths and a portrayal of a haphazardly assembled and poorly managed program. The report will detail 20 findings, plus 20 case studies that the Senate Democrats say illustrate CIA's misrepresentations about the program. The Osama bin Laden hunt is one of the 20 case studies. Countries that cooperated with the CIA, hosting black site prisons and assisting in transferring detainees, will be identified only obliquely and not by name. CIA employees, referred to by pseudonyms in the report, won't be identified; the CIA pushed for the pseudonyms to be redacted because other information in the report could be used to determine who they are. The Senate report was conceived initially as a bipartisan review of the CIA program, though Republicans senators pulled support from the investigation soon after it began. Its findings likely will end up being seen through the prism of the deeply-partisan divide over the Bush-era counter-terrorism tactics and whether they actually produced intelligence to keep the nation safe. The investigation produced a report that is more than 6,000 pages. But only the 480-page executive summary is being released, following months of negotiations between the Senate and the White House over redactions. According to an administration official, 93% of the report is unredacted. ""There's going to be nothing lost in this narrative,"" the official added. There also will be a separate rebuttal by the committee's Republicans. And the CIA will publish its own study of the program. Conspicuously absent from the Senate report is any examination of the role of high-level officials in the Bush White House who authorized the CIA program and who urged that more aggressive tactics be used. That omission appears to lay blame for the program's excesses solely on the CIA, when top Bush officials ordered the agency to come up with the detention and interrogation program. A Senate aide said the purpose of the report wasn't to point fingers at the Bush administration, but to examine the program itself. The central conclusion by the Democratic-led Senate report, according to people briefed on the investigation, is that CIA employees exceeded the guidelines set by Justice Department memos that authorized the use and that the agency misrepresented to Congress and the White House what it was doing. The report has also opened a rare public rift between the current White House and some Democrats on Capitol Hill. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee and is usually a defender of the CIA, has unleashed stinging criticism of the agency after what she said was a series of cover-ups including the destruction of interrogation tapes. ""The interrogations and the conditions of confinement at the CIA detention sites were far different and far more harsh than the way the CIA had described them to us,"" Feinstein said on the Senate floor in March. Related: Shocking report closer to completion . Her remarks came during a spat with the CIA. Feinstein was angry at the discovery that CIA employees had conducted searches of computers used by Senate staffers at a CIA facility to conduct their investigation. The CIA in turn accused Senate staffers of hacking into CIA computers to obtain documents they weren't entitled to.â€‹ . In a phone call Friday , Secretary of State John Kerry asked Feinstein to consider the broader implications of the timing of the report's release, said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. ""A lot is going on in the world, and he wanted to make sure that foreign policy implications were being appropriately factored into timing,""  Psaki said. ""These include our ongoing efforts against ISIL and the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world."" During the call, Kerry made it clear ""that the timing is of course her choice,""  Psaki  said. Feinstein also claimed some of the report's findings challenge the ""societal and constitutional"" values of America. ""We have to get this report out,"" Feinstein told the Los Angeles Times in an interview Sunday. ""Anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again."" Did torture work? Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent, who was one of the bureau's top al Qaeda experts, says the torture ""didn't work."" In an opinion article published in the New York Times last year, Soufan says ""torture led us away from Bin Laden. After [Khalid Sheikh] Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times, he actually played down the importance of the courier who ultimately led us to Bin Laden."" John Rizzo, who was the CIA's acting general counsel during the period, is convinced the program helped find bin Laden and that it protected the nation. ""I believed the program yielded valuable intelligence and I continue to believe this,"" he told CNN in an interview earlier this year. Also in dispute -- and some say unknowable -- is whether other methods could have produced the same or better information than what the CIA program produced. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials have mixed views on whether any intelligence information still in use by intelligence analysts came from the program. Some officials say that because of the way intelligence is gathered, it's impossible to determine whether strands of intelligence, used to keep tabs on al Qaeda terrorists, came from the now-banned interrogations. Others say that the FBI and CIA already had detailed knowledge of al Qaeda and that the program simply duplicated information already in the hands of intelligence analysts. For some Republicans and CIA supporters, there's still a dispute about whether techniques like waterboarding, used on three detainees, constitutes torture. The Justice Department twice has investigated the conduct of CIA employees involved in the program and decided not to bring charges. President Obama an early critic of the program as senator, has tried to be more even-handed since taking office. ""We tortured some folks,"" the president said in August, adding that there was a need to recall the context of the era, including the fear of follow-up attacks.  ""In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, we did some things that were wrong â€” we did a whole lot of things that were right, but we did some things that were contrary to our values... I understand why it happened. It's important when we look back to recall how afraid people were.""","Senate Democrats are set to release a long-delayed and much-anticipated review of American interrogation techniques .

"Deer Trail, a small Colorado town, is considering a measure that would allow its residents to hunt for federal drones and shoot them down. ""Is it illegal? Of course it is. But it's also illegal to spy on American citizens,"" resident Phillip Steel told CNN in a phone interview. ""If they fly in town, we will shoot them down."" Steel said he wrote the ordinance after he learned the Federal Aviation Administration ""loosened regulations that would allow the flight of drones in domestic airspace."" The FAA recently announced plans to create six drone test sites around the country, none of which has been publicly listed. It plans to allow widespread use of domestic drones in 2015. ""The overall purpose of this test site program is to develop a body of data and operational experiences to inform integration and the safe operation of these aircraft in the National Airspace System,"" the agency said. Drones are cheaper to operate than helicopters. They can be used for multiple tasks, such as monitoring crops and livestock and assessing building damage. Deer Trail, which bills itself as the ""Home of the World's First Rodeo,"" has 584 residents and is 50 miles outside Aurora. The entire town takes up less than one square mile. Any resident can petition for a citizens' initiative and then draft an ordinance. Bounties and shotguns . The Town Board of Trustees will vote on the drone ordinance on August 6. If passed, it would legalize the sale of drone hunting licenses for $25 and offer bounties for captured drones. Six trustees and the mayor make up the board. It would take a simple majority vote to pass the ordinance. ""It is very symbolic ... it's asserting our right and drawing a line in the sand,"" Steel said. ""It declares sovereignty of the airspace."" The ordinance doesn't aim to stop airliner flights, he said. It outlines the rules of engagement for drone hunters and the types of ammunition allowed. Bounty amounts from $25 to $100, and weapons are limited to 12-gauge shotguns. It states that ""no background investigation shall be performed"" on those seeking a drone hunting license. Additionally, the licenses would be ""issued on an anonymous basis."" ""Unmanned aerial vehicles may be engaged at a vertical distance of one thousand feet or less,"" and the ""licenses shall only remain valid within the geographic boundaries of the Town of Deer Trail, Colorado,"" according to the ordinance. Federal legislation (18 USC 1361) prohibits stealing or damaging federal government property and establishes provisions for fines and imprisonment. The illegality of the actions within the ordinance doesn't scare Steel. ""I took an oath when I joined the military to protect the U.S. Constitution. That oath did not end when I left,"" he said. When asked if he had ever seen a drone in Deer Trail, Steel said, ""In real life, no. I hope I never see a drone in Deer Trail. ... This ordinance is a statement against the coming surveillance society. It's a very clear statement against that."" ""In all practicality, nobody is going to shoot down any drones any time soon,"" he added. 'Our mark on the map' Town Clerk Kim Oldfield says she believes the ordinance could benefit the town. ""This could actually be something to help fund a community center or build us some roads. We need to find our mark on the map,"" Oldfield said. ""The novelty of being allowed to buy a drone-hunting license could turn into a fun thing."" Board of Trustees member David Boyd said the ordinance has a good chance of passing. ""I think it's important. I know Phil Steel also wants to make a statement about drones. ...  Mostly for us, the outcome we want will be to have some fun and make some money,"" Boyd said. Deer Trail Mayor Frank Fields says he agrees with Boyd. He said the purpose of the ordinance would be ""to have fun and bring in business, tourism and activities for people in town."" Colorado Attorney General John W. Suthers said state residents have a sense of humor. He responded to the idea of the ordinance by saying, ""A resolution by the town of Deer Trail to allow the hunting of drones is made in the same spirit as the proposal of some rural Coloradans to create a separate state. And both ideas have the same chance to legally succeed: none.""","Deer Trail aims to sell drone hunting licenses for $25, offer bounties for downed drones .

"When police found the unconscious man in a Southern California Motel 6, the IDs on him said he was Michael Thomas Boatwright from Florida. But when the man awoke at Desert Regional Medical Center a few days later, he said he'd never heard of Boatwright. He didn't recall serving in the U.S. Navy. Or of being born in Florida. When doctors told him he had five tennis rackets in his hotel room, he couldn't say why. When they showed him photos of himself with others, he didn't recognize them, or himself. And he didn't speak a word of English. The man said his name was Johan Ek. And he said it in Swedish. That was back in February. Today, the 61-year-old man says he has come to terms with the name ""Michael Boatwright,"" but only because doctors told him he should. He still feels like Johan Ek from Sweden. And he can't explain why. The case was first reported by the Desert Sun. Car crash leaves Australian woman with French accent . Digging in the past . Before she became a social worker at Desert Regional Medical Center, Lisa Hunt-Vasquez was an archeologist. Those digging skills came in handy the day she met Johan Ek/Michael Boatwright. Her mission: Help Boatwright figure out who he is. She first contacted the military. Among the IDs police discovered on him was one from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He'd served from 1971 to 1973 in the Navy as an aviation mechanic. Hunt-Vasquez dug deeper. The Asia connection . She found a website for the TRP English school in China. Turns out Boatwright taught English there for four years, until May. In an essay he wrote for the site, he mentioned he worked as an English instructor in Japan for 10 years, and that he was married to a Japanese woman. They have a 12-year-old son together, he wrote. The leads looked promising. But there was one hitch. Photos found with Boatwright in the motel room showed a young man living in what looked like a European city, not Asia. Hunt-Vasquez kept searching. She came across several websites dedicated to graphic designs. Boatwright often used the screen name 'korstemplar' and listed himself as a Swede living and teaching in China. The pieces were falling into place. A roadblock . He had lived in Japan, married, became a father. He then moved to China. The school in China told her he was divorced. He lived there until May, when his visa expired and he flew to California. But when she contacted the Japanese and Chinese consulates, neither had next-of-kin information for him, according to the Desert Sun. Staffers called all the numbers on the phone Boatwright had with him. They either went to voice mail or no one picked up, the newspaper said. She had hit a dead end. His life so far . Everything Boatwright knows about his life before February 28 he knows because his social worker told him or because he read it on websites. He told CNN he learned that in 1987 he operated a consulting company called Kultur Konsult Nykoping. That is somewhat of a Swedish connection. He doesn't have any independent knowledge of his life before he woke up in the hospital. He doesn't even know exactly what his consulting company did. Boatwright told CNN he'd been a good tennis player, and the Tennis Channel had interviewed him years ago. Perhaps, he said, he'd come to southern California for the tennis tournament season. That would certainly explain the five rackets in his hotel room. A 'fugue state' According to the Desert Sun, Boatwright is in a ""fugue state."" People in this condition lose their sense of personal identity, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They become confused about past events and often wander far from home. Fugue states, such as dissociative fugue, are often triggered by trauma, such as the death of a loved one or a serious accident, according to Dr. Aaron Anderson, a neurologist at Emory University School of Medicine. Patients sometimes assume different personalities, Anderson added. The relatively rare disorder often goes away on its own, but it can take several months. What the future holds . Now that Boatwright's story has spread to the Swedish media, several Swedes have come forth to say they knew him in the 1980s. Late Monday night, the Desert Sun reported it found Boatwright's sister in Louisiana. ""I haven't talked to him in years. He just disappeared,"" Michelle Brewer told the paper. Learning about his life hasn't helped him much psychologically. He still feels isolated in the hospital, so Hunt-Vasquez encouraged him to reach out to members of the local Swedish-American community. ""They said he was getting depressed because he wasn't able to communicate,"" said Linda Kosvic, chairman of the Vasa Order of America chapter in San Jacinto, California. ""We've been trying to provide him support and make him feel more comfortable."" Members visit him in the hospital, bringing him Swedish foods. The hospital would like to discharge Boatwright, but they have no place to send him, said Richard Ramhoff, a spokesman for Desert Regional Medical Center. They can't send him home until they know where home is.","The man doesn't recognize himself .
He doesn't speak English .

"The American citizen sentenced to 15 years in a North Korean labor camp has appealed to the Korean authorities for forgiveness and asked the United States for help in securing his release in an exclusive interview from prison obtained Wednesday by CNN. Pae Jun Ho, known as Kenneth Bae by U.S. authorities, was found guilty in an April 30 trial of ""hostile acts to bring down its government"" and planning anti-North Korea religious activities, according to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). ""Although my health is not good, I am being patient and coping well,"" Bae said. ""And I hope that with the help of the North Korean government and the United States, I will be released soon."" In the interview footage, his head was shaved and his face noticeably thinner than the previous photos of the Korean-American. Bae wore a blue prison garment streaked with sweat and dirt that bore the number 103. ""I know what I did is not easily forgivable, but I hope that things will work out so that I can be with my family again soon,"" Bae continued. The video was made by a pro-North Korean group based in Tokyo, Choson Sinbo, which interviewed Bae in prison recently. The interview is believed to be the first since Bae's sentencing about two months ago. Choson Sinbo was permitted to conduct the interview by North Korea. The edited footage, which runs less than eight minutes, was made available to CNN. The timing of the Bae interview comes after North Korea proposed high-level talks with the United States last month. Washington does not appear to be rushing towards talks, as it has previously stated that Pyongyang must take concrete steps to denuclearize as a pre-condition. However, North Korea has stated before that Bae is not a ""political bargaining chip"" through KCNA. The United States has called on the North to grant Bae amnesty, citing concerns about the lack of transparency in the North Korean legal system . ""There is no greater priority for us than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad and we urge the DPRK authorities to grant Mr. Bae amnesty and immediate release,"" said Brent Byers, spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy in South Korea. He added that the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which represents U.S. interests there, has met with Bae six times since his arrest. In the interview, Bae sat in a room next to a door and a radiator. He calmly described his current prison life as eight hours of farm labor -- which he had never done before --  with a break in the middle of the day and lunch. He was also filmed clearing the fields, wearing black gloves and a hat as a guard stood watch nearby. When asked if prison life was bearable, Bae replied, ""Yes, people here are very considerate. But my health is not in the best condition, so there are some difficulties. But, everyone here is considerate and generous, and we have doctors here, so I'm getting regular check-ups."" He spoke of health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and a back problem. Bae spoke stoically throughout the interview conducted in Korean. But his eyes welled with tears when he spoke about his father's upcoming 70th birthday on July 4 — American Independence Day holiday. ""I was hoping that my problem would be worked out by end of June.  So my hope is that North Korea will forgive, and the U.S. will try harder to get me out speedily.  I'm asking for their help."" He paused and bowed his head, blinking back tears. As he tried to compose himself, he spoke between deep breaths. ""I am an only son.. my father, I really hope to go to congratulate him on his birthday."" Bae said he has had only had two phone calls with his family -- once before the trial and another after the trial. North Korean media has detailed the reasons why Bae was sentenced. Among the list of alleged crimes was 1) setting up bases in China for the ""purpose of toppling the DPRK government,"" 2) encouraging DPRK citizens to bring down its government and 3) conducting a ""malignant smear campaign."" KCNA added that Bae had planned what it called a ""Jericho operation"" to bring down North Korea through religious activities. It suggested that Bae could have been sentenced to death, but avoided it through ""candid confession of his crimes."" Bae said in the interview that he refused a defense attorney in his trial because he had admitted to breaking North Korean laws in his preliminary hearings. ""I admitted to the charges, so I thought that it wasn't really necessary to have a defense lawyer during the trial. I admitted to my crime, and apologized for it,"" he said. KCNA said the Korean-American was arrested November 3 after arriving as a tourist in Rason City, a port in the northeastern corner of North Korea. It described Bae is being held at a ""special prison,"" although there was little detail of what that entailed. The prison where Bae was interviewed was not disclosed by Choson Sinbu. Bae is father to three children, according to his sister, Terri Chung. In a previous interview with CNN, she said that her brother is ""a good man; he's not a spy. He has never had any evil intentions against North Korea, or any other country for that matter."" She had said that he is the owner of a tour company and was in North Korea for work. Bae graduated from the University of Oregon in 1992, according to a website created by his friends. In the Facebook page and a website called ""Free Kenneth,"" friends describe him as a man who volunteered with disadvantaged students and liked helping people. Former NBA star Dennis Rodman has even appealed to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un  asking him on Twitter to ""do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose."" Previous situations involving Americans arrested in North Korea have usually been resolved with a red-carpet appearance by a prominent former official. In 2010, former President Jimmy Carter secured the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a former English teacher who had been sentenced to eight years of hard labor for entering the North from China. In 2009, the North freed American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee to former President Bill Clinton. Ling and Lee had been arrested while reporting from the North Korean-Chinese border on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign and sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp. Bae said he regretted that his parents are worried and in shock over his situation. ""I know that my family is trying their best to try to help me, I know that they pray for me. I would like to plea for the help of the North Korean and United States governments.""","U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae spoke to pro-North Korea group Choson Sinbo .

"Jenny McCarthy is joining ABC's ""The View"" -- one of the most visible morning TV shows in America. In the press announcement, Barbara Walters said of her, ""Jenny brings us intelligence as well as warmth and humor. She can be serious and outrageous."" Let's talk about the outrages. Much of the criticism toward hiring McCarthy, including mine, has focused on her stance against vaccines. She has repeatedly claimed that that vaccines played a major role in giving her son autism, that  he ""recovered"" from autism thanks to a special diet, and the government and medical establishment did not bother to investigate her son's recovery. She argues that we vaccinate too much, too quickly, and that the research on a link between autism and vaccines should continue. Her charity, Generation Rescue, continues to question the safety of vaccines and sponsors events starring anti-vaccine advocates, such as Andrew Wakefield, a disgraced British doctor. Let us be clear: The statements she has made about vaccines are deceitful and dangerous. If you're curious about the anti-vaccine scare and McCarthy's part in spreading misinformation, read ""The Panic Virus"" by Seth Mnookin or follow the work of Phil Plait. If you think a few parents choosing not to vaccinate their children has no impact on your life, Plait and Mnookin (and the CDC and pretty much every pediatrician) will gladly refute that misconception. But beyond the damage she's already caused, I'm worried about what she's going to do next, now that she has an even bigger platform. McCarthy has displayed a willingness to leap into new belief systems and promote them to people hungry for answers. Her journey through the world of hunch-based parenting has taken a number of twists and turns.  In 2006, as recounted by Mnookin, a random woman told McCarthy that her son was a ""Crystal"" and McCarthy an ""Indigo."" Suddenly, McCarthy plunged into the new age philosophy of Indigo moms and their Crystal children -- believed to be the next phase of human evolution. That never took off so she dumped it and moved on to the anti-vaccine movement.  She landed time with Oprah and Rosie, and wrote multiple books on ""healing autism.""  Although her TV and movie career eventually stalled, her popularity among desperate parents, discredited scientists, sellers of snake oil, and conspiracy theorists has apparently propelled her back into the spotlight. ""The View"" is watched by millions of people, many of whom are parents of young children, a staple market for daytime TV. Parents are more likely to jump at ""fads"" rather than sticking to ""evidence-based"" parenting. It's hard to blame them for this characteristic -- they are primed to be afraid. Parents are told that unless they buy a given product, their child will get sick, learn too slowly, fail to flourish, or even die.  Being a parent requires so many leaps of faith on a day-to-day basis. We just hope and pray that we're getting it mostly right. When someone claims to have answers, especially someone with the intelligence and charisma of a Jenny McCarthy, parents are easy targets. In the world of special needs parenting, a world to which both McCarthy and I belong, parents are even more afraid and seek answers. Doctors present parents like us with long lists of risk factors and complicated prognoses.  The days are hard, laden with therapies, doctor visits, worries about medical expenses, estate planning, schooling, bullying, transportation, and so much more. All of the fears become magnified. I don't want you to pity parents of children with special needs, but do understand that many of us are looking for answers to questions we barely understand. Parents of children with autism, in particular, have proven especially susceptible to fraud and fear. Life with autism can be hard. Studies found that stress levels for primary caregivers of children with autism compare to those of soldiers deployed in combat zones. Some parents have not only followed McCarthy's decision to create a gluten-free/casein-free diet, as still advocated on her organization's website, but have pursued much more extreme measures.  At this year's Autism One/Generation Rescue conference in Chicago, many sessions focused on costly stem-cell treatments, though no science supports the idea that injecting a child with stem cells will cure autism. In previous years, panels at the same conference have promoted the practice of giving autistic children bleach orally and as an enema -- all as part of a detox method (predicated on the idea that autism is an environmental disease). Parents who do this are not cruel; they're just looking for hope. Enter Jenny McCarthy, a woman who evangelizes. She jumps at fads, hunches, intuitions and really bad ideas. She believes them. She makes them hers. Then she builds institutions to promote them with the full-throated roar of a new convert. McCarthy has profited handsomely from her outrageous views.  She is intelligent, funny and persuasive. She writes books that sell very well. Her organizations throw successful events. She is a tireless promoter of her ideas. And now she's a host on ""The View."" What idea will she seize on next? What dangerous fad will she claim needs more study? How many parents, at home in the morning, will be persuaded? I'm deeply disappointed that Barbara Walters and ABC have decided to let us find out the answers to these troubling questions.","Jenny McCarthy is joining ABC's ""The View"" -- one of the most visible morning TV shows .

"In July 2012, responding to allegations that the video-chat service Skype -- owned by Microsoft -- was changing its protocols to make it possible for the government to eavesdrop on users, Corporate Vice President Mark Gillett took to the company's blog to deny it. Turns out that wasn't quite true. Or at least he -- or the company's lawyers -- carefully crafted a statement that could be defended as true while completely deceiving the reader.  You see, Skype wasn't changing its protocols to make it possible for the government to eavesdrop on users, because the government was already able to eavesdrop on users. At a Senate hearing in March, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper assured the committee that his agency didn't collect data on hundreds of millions of Americans.  He was lying, too.  He later defended his lie by inventing a new definition of the word ""collect,"" an excuse that didn't even pass the laugh test. As Edward Snowden's documents reveal more about the NSA's activities, it's becoming clear that we can't trust anything anyone official says about these programs. Google and Facebook insist that the NSA has no ""direct access"" to their servers.  Of course not; the smart way for the NSA to get all the data is through sniffers. Apple says it's never heard of PRISM.  Of course not; that's the internal name of the NSA database.  Companies are publishing reports purporting to show how few requests for customer-data access they've received, a meaningless number when a single Verizon request can cover all of  their customers.  The Guardian reported that Microsoft secretly worked with the NSA to subvert the security of Outlook, something it carefully denies.  Even President Obama's justifications and denials are phrased with the intent that the listener will take his words very literally and not wonder what they really mean. NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander has claimed that the NSA's massive surveillance and data mining programs have helped stop more than 50 terrorist plots, 10 inside the U.S.  Do you believe him?  I think it depends on your definition of ""helped.""  We're not told whether these programs were instrumental in foiling the plots or whether they just happened to be of minor help because the data was there.  It also depends on your definition of ""terrorist plots.""  An examination (PDF) of plots that that FBI claims to have foiled since 9/11 reveals that would-be terrorists have commonly been delusional, and most have been egged on by FBI undercover agents or informants. Left alone, few were likely to have accomplished much of anything. Both government agencies and corporations have cloaked themselves in so much secrecy that it's impossible to verify anything they say; revelation after revelation demonstrates that they've been lying to us regularly and tell the truth only when there's no alternative. There's much more to come.  Right now, the press has published only a tiny percentage of the documents Snowden took with him.  And Snowden's files are only a tiny percentage of the number of secrets our government is keeping, awaiting the next whistle-blower. Ronald Reagan once said ""trust but verify.""  That works only if we can verify.  In a world where everyone lies to us all the time, we have no choice but to trust blindly, and we have no reason to believe that anyone is worthy of blind trust.  It's no wonder that most people are ignoring the story; it's just too much cognitive dissonance to try to cope with it. This sort of thing can destroy our country.  Trust is essential in our society.  And if we can't trust either our government or the corporations that have intimate access into so much of our lives, society suffers. Study after study demonstrates the value of living in a high-trust society and the costs of living in a low-trust one. Rebuilding trust is not easy, as anyone who has betrayed or been betrayed by a friend or lover knows, but the path involves transparency, oversight and accountability.  Transparency first involves coming clean.  Not a little bit at a time, not only when you have to, but complete disclosure about everything.  Then it involves continuing disclosure.  No more secret rulings by secret courts about secret laws.  No more secret programs whose costs and benefits remain hidden. Oversight involves meaningful constraints on the NSA, the FBI and others.  This will be a combination of things: a court system that acts as a third-party advocate for the rule of law rather than a rubber-stamp organization, a legislature that understands what these organizations are doing and regularly debates requests for increased power, and vibrant public-sector watchdog groups that analyze and debate the government's actions. Accountability means that those who break the law, lie to Congress or deceive the American people are held accountable.  The NSA has gone rogue, and while it's probably not possible to prosecute people for what they did under the enormous veil of secrecy it currently enjoys, we need to make it clear that this behavior will not be tolerated in the future.  Accountability also means voting, which means voters need to know what our leaders are doing in our name. This is the only way we can restore trust.  A market economy doesn't work unless consumers can make intelligent buying decisions based on accurate product information. That's why we have agencies like the FDA, truth-in-packaging laws and prohibitions against false advertising. In the same way, democracy can't work unless voters know what the government is doing in their name. That's why we have open-government laws.  Secret courts making secret rulings on secret laws, and companies flagrantly lying to consumers about the insecurity of their products and services, undermine the very foundations of our society.

"U.S. President Barack Obama pledged $7 billion Sunday to help combat frequent power blackouts in sub-Saharan Africa. Funds from the initiative, dubbed Power Africa, will be distributed over the next five years. Obama made the announcement during his trip to South Africa, the continent's biggest economy. ""Access to electricity is fundamental to opportunity in this age. It's the light that children study by, the energy that allows an idea to be transformed into a real business. It's the lifeline for families to meet their most basic needs, and it's the connection that's needed to plug Africa into the grid of the global economy,"" he said. Two-thirds of the population of sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to electricity, including more than 85% of those living in rural areas, the White House said. ""A light where currently there is darkness -- the energy to lift people out of poverty --  that's what opportunity looks like,"" Obama told students at Cape Town University. ""So this is America's vision: a partnership with Africa for growth, and the potential for every citizen, not just a few at the top."" The program includes $1.5 billion from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation and $5 billion from the Export-Import Bank, the White House said. Sub-Saharan Africa will need more than $300 billion to achieve universal electricity access by 2030, it said. The preliminary setup will include Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. ""These countries have set ambitious goals in electric power generation, and are making the utility and energy sector reforms to pave the way for investment and growth,"" a White House statement said. Obama's three-nation African trip started in Senegal and will end in Tanzania this week. The visit aims to bolster U.S. investment opportunities, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy. It comes as China aggressively engages the continent, pouring billions of dollars into it and replacing the United States as Africa's largest trading partner. Obama applauded China's investment in Africa, saying he is ""not threatened by it."" Africa's greater integration into the global economy will benefit everyone with the potential creation of new jobs and opportunities, he said. ""I'm here because I think the United States needs to engage with a continent full of promise and possibility,"" Obama said. ""It's good for the United States. I welcome the attention that Africa is receiving from China, Brazil, India and Turkey."" However, he urged African officials to ensure that those who invest in the continent and its natural resources benefit Africans in terms of jobs and other assets. Obama also visited Robben Island, where anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela spent a majority of his 27-year imprisonment, on Sunday. And he spoke at Cape Town University, the site of a famous speech by Robert F. Kennedy at the height of apartheid in 1966.

"The George Zimmerman investigation was hijacked ""in a number of ways"" by outside forces, said the former police chief of Sanford, Florida. Bill Lee, who testified Monday in Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial, told CNN's George Howell in an exclusive interview that he felt pressure from city officials to arrest Zimmerman to placate the public rather than as a matter of justice. ""It was (relayed) to me that they just wanted an arrest. They didn't care if it got dismissed later,"" he said. ""You don't do that."" When Sanford police arrived on the scene on February 26, 2012, after Zimmerman fatally shot unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, they conducted a ""sound"" investigation, and the evidence provided no probable cause to arrest Zimmerman at the scene, he said. It had nothing to do with Florida's controversial ""Stand Your Ground"" law, he said; from an investigative standpoint, it was purely a matter of self-defense. Zimmerman told police he killed Martin after the teen attacked him. While the evidence at the time corroborated that claim, the ex-chief said, Lee's lead investigator made a recommendation that Zimmerman be charged with manslaughter. Justice Dept. 'peacekeepers' worked 'Trayvon' rallies, group claims . It was a matter of protocol, Lee said. Arresting Zimmerman based on the evidence at hand would have been a violation of Zimmerman's Fourth Amendment rights, he said. Thus, the Sanford police presented a ""capias request"" to the state's attorney, asking that the prosecutor determine whether it was a ""justifiable homicide,"" issue a warrant for arrest or present the case to a grand jury. ""The police department needed to do a job, and there was some influence -- outside influence and inside influence -- that forced a change in the course of the normal criminal justice process,"" Lee said. ""With all the influence and the protests and petitions for an arrest, you still have to uphold your oath."" ""That investigation was taken away from us. We weren't able to complete it,"" he said. One example involved the 911 tapes, in which neighbors implored dispatchers to send police as a voice in the background screamed for help. The Sanford police intended to release the tapes once the probe was over, Lee said, because you can't publicize evidence amid an investigation. Instead, the mayor told him on March 16 the tapes had been released to Martin's family and the public. The family was asked to help identify voices, Lee said, but if police were in charge of the investigation, they wouldn't have presented evidence to a group. ""It should be done individually so there's no influence on the other people in the room,"" he said. ""Then, there's no questions that can be brought up about how (an identification) was obtained or whether it was influenced."" Releasing the evidence to the public was problematic, as well, because it created the potential for someone to concoct a ""story about what they observed when they really didn't observe it,"" he said. Martin family attorney Jasmine Rand said she doesn't believe playing the tapes to a room full of people ""makes any difference to the outcome of the case."" ""We have to remember that that was played for the family in a private room because they were hearing the last moments of their son's life as he cried for help,"" Rand told CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday night. ""And I think Sybrina Fulton (Martin's mother) got up and walked out of that room. She didn't sit in there and talk to everybody, because she had a visceral reaction when she heard her son yell for help and she couldn't help him because she knew he was dead."" Lee was placed on paid leave March 22, 2012, after the Sanford City Commission expressed a lack of confidence in him. The same commission rejected his resignation in a 3-2 vote a month later, with dissenting commissioners questioning the fairness of Lee's losing his job. Two months later, Lee was sacked. City Manager Norton Bonaparte said in a news release, ""The police chief needs to have the trust and respect of the elected officials and the confidence of the entire community."" Lee believes lack of confidence did play a role in his dismissal, he told CNN, but he also believes Bonaparte faced political pressure and terminated him ""without cause,"" which was permitted under his employment contract. ""I upheld my oath,"" Lee said. ""I'm happy that at the end of the day I can walk away with my integrity."" Asked whether he would do things differently given the opportunity, the 30-year veteran of law enforcement said there always are things he could change in hindsight, but he stands by the investigation. At every turn in the 40-minute interview with CNN's Howell, Lee doggedly defended his investigators, saying race never played a role in any decision and that his officers ""conducted an unbiased review."" Investigators knew letting Zimmerman walk free for 46 days was an unpopular decision -- and they took abuse for it -- ""but they performed professionally. That's the mark of a strong police department."" Lee took issue with the media casting his department as apathetic or lackadaisical in the case. ""A lot of the information that was given out as fact was misinformation,"" he said. ""It was reported in some media that we didn't conduct an investigation for two weeks, but yet in that same media they would show a photograph of a crime scene with crime scene tape, with patrol cars and blue lights and investigators on the scene."" Lee shrugged off the notion that he was hired to clean up racism and other problems in the department. His goal upon becoming chief was to improve professionalism and trust, and he set several goals, all of which were met during his 10-month tenure, he said. One of his greatest regrets, he said, is that the Zimmerman investigation ultimately shattered his childhood dream to be police chief of the community where he was raised. ""It's a dream of a vision that is going to be unrealized,"" he said. ""I'm at peace with it on most days. I'm a man of faith. But it stings.","Martin family attorney disputes ex-police chief's rationale for his firing .

"An armed robber held up a jewelry exhibition in the French resort city of Cannes on Sunday, stealing jewels worth $53 million (40 million euros), a Nice police official told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The robbery -- the third such heist around the city since May -- took place Sunday morning at the Carlton Hotel, according to Philippe Vique, deputy prosecutor for organized crime in the prosecutor's office for the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. He could not confirm the value of the jewelry. The robber, whose face was covered by a hat and a scarf, threatened to shoot the exhibitors and guests, Vique said. Security guards were present but unarmed, he said. The exhibitor, Leviev Extraordinary Diamonds, confirmed the heist and said it was ""relieved that no one was injured in the robbery."" The gems were supposed to have been on display until the end of August. The robbery follows two major jewel heists this year at events tied to the Cannes Film Festival. Read more: $1 million jewels stolen during Cannes Film Festival . During the festival in May, a necklace worth $2.6 million (2 million euros) was stolen from a hotel party shortly after more than $1 million worth of jewels were stolen from a safe in a hotel room. Jeweler de Grisogono said the necklace was part of a collection making its debut. The jewels were from the Swiss firm Chopard, which was sponsoring the festival. Read more: The world's biggest diamond heists . The high-profile thefts follow a brazen heist in neighboring Belgium in February. Eight masked, heavily armed men used two vehicles to burst through a hole in the perimeter fence at Brussels Airport and nabbed $50 million in rough and polished diamonds from the hold of a Zurich-bound aircraft before speeding away. More than 30 arrests have been made in that incident. And in 2008, four armed robbers -- two disguised as women -- walked into luxury jeweler Harry Winston's store on Paris' famed Champs Elysees and swiped an estimated $111 million worth of merchandise in the span of 15 minutes. Those gems were found in 2011, hidden in a rain sewer at a house in the Parisian suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis.","An armed robber steals $53 million worth of jewels from a hotel, police official says .

"Less than a week after drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero was released from prison because of procedural errors, the Mexican government wants him locked up. The office of the Mexican attorney general late Wednesday said that it has issued a warrant for ""provisional detention,"" acting on a request from the United States. A Mexican judge signed off on the request. Once Caro Quintero is detained, the office said, the United States will have 60 days to formally request his extradition. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam earlier said his office would review the decision of a Mexican appeals court to release the trafficker. Caro Quintero had served 28 years when he was freed Friday because he was tried in the federal system, when his crimes should have been dealt with at the state level. He was convicted of torturing and killing U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena in 1985, but the appeals court dismissed that conviction. ""I am studying the reasons of why he was freed,"" Murillo said. ""The attorney general's office will use the resources available to it ... to avoid this type of impunity."" The attorney general told journalists that there was no extradition request in place at the time that Caro Quintero was freed, and it is unclear whether any such request has been filed since last week, according to the state-run Notimex news agency. When asked by CNN, neither the U.S. State Department nor the Justice Department would say whether they had requested Caro Quintero's arrest. Caro Quintero remained on the DEA's most-wanted list during his incarceration in Mexico. Because the appeals court had vacated his conviction for Camarena's murder, any extradition request would have to be for other crimes, Murillo said, according to Notimex. The ruling also dismissed accusations against Caro Quintero of the killings of two other Americans -- John Clay Walker of Minneapolis and Albert Radelat of Fort Worth. The family of one of the Americans killed says they were targeted in retaliation for DEA drug raids. A conviction for drug trafficking was upheld, but Caro Quintero had already completed the prison sentence for that crime, the ruling said. He was indicted in the Central District of California in 1988 on racketeering charges, which were eventually augmented with charges of kidnapping and murder of a federal agent. A second indictment in the same district charges Caro Quintero with conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine and marijuana. He also was indicted in the District of Arizona on drug trafficking charges.","Mexican authorities seeking ""provisional detention"" of Caro Quintero .

"One day when she was 76 years old, Rosa Rodrigo took a wrong turn out of a shopping center parking lot and found she had no idea where to turn next. ""It was a little scary because I didn't remember where I came from, or where I was going,"" she recalls. While Rodrigo and her family were alarmed, it was only after several more years of fading memory and worsening mental condition that Rodrigo was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Almost since the disease was identified back in 1906 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer, scientists have been looking for ways to identify it earlier. We do know the disease process begins in the brain 10 to 15 years before a patient's symptoms start. And, by the time memory problems develop, 40% to 50% of a patient's brain cells have already been affected or destroyed. There are certain hallmarks of Alzheimer's, including the accumulation of sticky plaques in the brain, made up of proteins called beta amyloid. The problem is that current technology cannot conclusively confirm the presence of the plaques. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved a brain imaging test -- a type of PET scan -- to detect the presence of amyloid proteins in the brain. The FDA made clear, however, that the scan alone is not enough to diagnose Alzheimer's. And, while examination of the spinal fluid or even a brain biopsy may offer a more definitive glimpse of what is happening in the brain, they require invasive procedures and it is not even clear who would be a candidate. In most instances, the best we have now is a clinical neurological exam after the patient has already suffered memory loss. More on Alzheimer's disease . That is why recent research caught my attention. Studying cadavers, researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles made an interesting observation: The amount of beta amyloid protein in the brain corresponded closely to the amount of that same protein in the retina, in the very back of the eye. It makes sense because, as our bodies develop from embryos, the retina is ultimately formed from the same tissue that makes up the brain. Based on that finding, the research team developed a noninvasive test to check the retina for the telltale beta amyloid plaques. They're now conducting a clinical trial to see if the test can identify patients who are starting to develop Alzheimer's but don't show symptoms yet. Rosa Rodrigo knows that in a very real sense, her disease was caught too late. Most days, she copes with grace. ""I don't even worry about it. If I remember [something], fine. If I don't, que sera, sera. What will be, will be,"" she said. But even though she knows she won't reap direct benefits, she signed up for the Cedars-Sinai trial. ""I'm very happy I can help somebody."" We don't know yet if the test will provide to be a good predictor of Alzheimer's, but officials at the Chicago-based Alzheimer's Association say the work is promising. A reliable eye test ""would be a very important contribution,"" says Maria Carrillo, the Vice-President of Medical and Scientific Relations at the Alzheimer's Association. ""People tend to go to the opthamologist more frequently as we age. If you could add a quick test to see if neurogenic pathology is going on the brain, it would be really helpful."" This research is important, because 1 in 8 people who are 65 and older have Alzheimer's disease, and the incidence of the disease is expected to nearly triple by 2050 as the number of older Americans grows. The expected cost of care at that time is expected to be more than $1 trillion a year. The 10 warning signs of Alzheimer's . The trial at Cedars-Sinai is not the only one to focus on the eyes, Carrillo says. Another company, Cognoptix, has a test that looks for amyloid proteins in the lens of the eye. ""We think it will provide greater sensitivity and specificity than looking in the retina,"" says Paul Hartung, the company's president and CEO. Cognoptix presented early data at the June meeting of the Alzheimer's Association, and is currently in the midst of a clinical trial with 40 patients. If it proves effective, says Hartung, the test would run approximately one-tenth the cost of the PET scan procedure. Another test being developed tracks subtle eye flickers known as saccadic movements, says Carrillo. ""When people start to have cognitive changes, these movements become more erratic, and slower,"" she explains. Yet another approach looks for changes in blood vessel infrastructure. ""It may not be specific to Alzheimer's,"" Carrillo notes, ""but a big part of this research initiative is trying to find what is different between this and other neurological disorders."" 'Dementia village' inspires new way to care . Dr. Keith Black, a neurosurgeon who is leading the Cedars-Sinai trial and who helped found a company to develop the retinal imaging test, says the problem with treatments being tested currently is that they're being given to patients at the end stage of the disease. ""If we can identify patients at 50 who are accumulating these plaques, and stop these plaques from accumulating, we have a much better chance of having an effective treatment,"" Black said. I want to be careful to not overstate the significance of early detection, however. While we doctors always love to catch things early, it is with the hope that it leads to earlier treatment. Unfortunately, with Alzheimer's, there isn't yet a treatment proven to cure or even slow down the disease. While it is certainly possible that a technology like this could present an opportunity to intervene earlier and to create strategies to measure the effectiveness of those interventions, the ultimate advice to patients may sound very familiar: Eat right and get plenty of physical exercise, which is something we should all be doing anyway. I do think this raises something else to consider: The psychological perspective. I am not entirely sure I would want to know the fate of my brain 10 to 15 years ahead of time, unless there was something I could certainly do about it.

"For decades, none but a few privileged -- and highly trained -- individuals could dare dream of traveling beyond Earth's orbit. All that's set to change as Richard Branson brings space exploration to the (mega-rich) masses. In April, Virgin Galactic -- a subsidiary of Branson's Virgin Group -- hit a milestone. The rocket motor the company had been testing on the ground was fitted into SpaceShip Two, the spacecraft that, from next year onwards, will bring space travel to the general public. ""We lit the rocket motor for the first time in the air and the spaceship went through the sound barrier,"" recalls Stephen Attenborough, Virgin Galactic's commercial director. ""It was a hugely significant milestone for us, and in many ways, the last big piece of the jigsaw."" Read more: Virgin Galactic one flight closer to space tourism . Though a ticket aboard SpaceShip Two doesn't come cheap -- a seat currently costs $250,000 -- Attenborough maintains that as things stand, the fare is a relative bargain. ""It's still about 1% of the price you would have needed to pay to go to space as a private citizen before now,"" maintains Attenborough. Indeed, in the past, the privilege cost civilians a fair share. When Dennis Tito, the world's first ""space tourist"" bought a seat aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2001, it allegedly cost him nearly $20 million. Read more: What does it feel like to be weightless? Though flights won't commence until next year at the earliest, Virgin Galactic has already sold 640 seats to space enthusiasts the world over. For some, the cost is negligible. Others, though, have taken second mortgages on their homes to pay for the tickets. So what does $250,000 buy you? The experience starts with three days of training at Spaceport America in New Mexico. ""There's a lot to do with getting you psychologically prepared for a trip that is absolutely about sensory overload,"" says Attenborough. Read more: Google goes inside the A380 . The flight itself accommodates six passengers, lasts two and a half hours, and culminates with congratulatory champagne at the spaceport. Space travelers get to leave their seats to experience several minutes of zero-gravity, and perhaps the most iconic view ever afforded mankind. ""Ultimately, you get memories to last a lifetime -- a trip I think will just blow people away. When talking to professional astronauts of the past, they don't talk about (their experiences) for a day or a year, they talk about it for the rest of their lives."" Still, there are many enthusiasts eager to see the price drop, not the least of whom is American astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Aldrin recalls the first time he heard the concept of private space travel debated in a meeting room 25 years ago. ""Somebody said, 'How are we going to select (who gets to fly to space)?' Someone in the back of the room said, 'How about a lottery?' Man, my ears perked up at that, and I became a devotee of a lottery to select people."" The civilian lottery is the basis of Aldrin's non-profit, SpaceShare. ""I wasn't interested in a big pay-off of the profit made. I was interested in exposing space to a large number of people,"" he says. Attenborough himself is eager to see the price drop. ""This is not just a business for Virgin. It's about the creation of a new and important industry that is going to transform space access. One of the byproducts of that is there will be competition, there will be economies of scale, and we should see the price go down,"" he says. ""Hopefully there will be a large, thriving, vibrant industry that will make it possible for most people to go into space in my lifetime.""","Virgin Galactic is scheduled to launch next year .

"The glossy spread in ""High Times"" a magazine for pot devotees, showcases the ""strongest strains on Earth."" The most recent rankings are topped by ""Head Cheese,"" which is grown in a hydroponic system and fed with a carefully calibrated dose of synthetic nutrients. On ""Weed Tracker,"" a California-based website where medical marijuana users share notes, cannabis connoisseurs sing the praises of ""Sensi Star"" and rave about the ""Grand Daddy Purple, which tastes like a berry vanilla smoothie."" Another medical site touts a bud ""finished with a subtle fruit effect ... offering a deep body stone with a creative mind high,"" and warns it is ""not for newbies or low-tolerance patients."" The descriptions evoke images of a wine-tasting club -- albeit one with a few eccentrics. But increasingly it seems the most valued trait among these weed admirers is pure knockout power. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Why I changed my mind on weed . The intoxicating chemical in marijuana is tetrahydracannabinol, or THC. While a handful of growers are finessing strains to provide a medical benefit without the high the majority aim to push THC content as high as it will go according to government data. In the annual Cannabis Cup competition, where marijuana enthusiasts gather to try pot from various places and vote on their favorites, the most potent strains have a THC content of around 25%, according to testing commissioned by the organizers at High Times. But at the University of Mississippi, in a laboratory that tracks the potency of marijuana seized by federal law enforcement officers, they've found even higher levels -- as high as 37%, according to Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly, the director of the Marijuana Potency Project. Since 1972, ElSohly says, the average THC content of marijuana has soared from less than 1% to 3 to 4% in the 1990s, to nearly 13% today. Legalizing pot isn't about medicine, it's about getting high . ""You really have to be careful,"" he says. ""The danger of this high-potency material is not with the experienced marijuana smokers, but young people who really don't know what they're smoking. They don't know what to expect, and before they know it, they've inhaled too much."" Fortunately, the risk of overdose with marijuana is far less serious than with cocaine or heroin. But certain behaviors -- like driving -- can be deadly if you're acutely intoxicated. ""The risk is not that you'll stop breathing or that you'll die,"" says Dr. Julie Holland, a psychiatrist in New York who studies the history and science of cannabis. ""The risk is that you'll become very altered and disoriented, and you can get anxious and panicky in that situation."" The only cure is a few hours of waiting, and reassurance. More than 455,000 patients entered emergency rooms with marijuana in their system in 2011, a 19% increase from just two years earlier according to government statistics. The figure represents all patients with marijuana in their system, whether or not the ER visit is related to the drug.  But most experts agree that along with showing an increase in usage, those numbers also indicate an increase in marijuana-related problems. ""There's an increase in psych admissions,"" says Dr. Stuart Gitlow, a psychiatrist who estimates that upwards of 1 in 100 people using high-THC marijuana experience psychotic symptoms. As president of the American Society for Addiction Medicine, Gitlow also worries about the long-term impact. Psychiatrist leads crusade to legalize marijuana . ""If you look at marijuana, the intensity has changed. So I would expect it to have a somewhat higher addictive potential."" Dr. Christian Thurstone, who runs an addiction treatment center in Denver, agrees that there is a trend toward heavier use. He's seen steadily higher levels of THC metabolites in clients' urine tests when they enter his program. ""It's more difficult to get kids clean,"" Thurstone says, ""because they come in less motivated for treatment, and more addicted."" With marijuana, the notion of addiction is complicated. Going cold turkey doesn't cause debilitating or life-threatening withdrawal symptoms, as it does for heavy alcohol or heroin users. Mention ""addiction"" to many users and you'll get a raised eyebrow. Still, some do report anxiety, insomnia or nausea when they try to kick the habit. Many experts cite a 1994 National Institute of Health report, which says that roughly 9% of marijuana users eventually meet the criteria for ""dependence."" But others are skeptical. ""There have always been high-THC content cigarettes around,"" says Carl Hart, a neuroscientist at Columbia University who studies the physical effects of cannabis and other drugs. ""The modest increases that we see today are not as concerning as has been made out to be."" Just as people drink hard liquor differently from beer, says Hart, they don't smoke highly potent cannabis the way they use weaker stuff. In his lab, for example, study participants are given three minutes to smoke a marijuana cigarette. ""If we give them a low dose, they suck down the whole thing. With stronger material, you'll see them give back the other half."" For most people, that seems to translate to the real world, whether the purpose of smoking is medicinal or recreational. ""The new stuff is a bit more potent than it was 20 years ago when I started smoking,"" says Chris Simunek, the editor of High Times. ""The end result for me is that I smoke a lot less of it."" Marijuana stops child's severe seizures . ""People are looking for strains that are higher in quality, because they'd rather smoke less,"" echoes Dr. Dean Weiss, a physician in Los Angeles who writes approval letters for medical marijuana patients. Simunek thinks there's an unmet demand. ""If people came out with boutique strains that are not so potent, people would buy them."" But for most of his patients, Weiss says high quality means high THC. Smoking anything is problematic in terms of health, because of irritation to the throat and lungs. But with marijuana, Holland makes the point that it's actually a method of ingestion. By comparison, pot brownies and other edibles make it easy to miss your target high. ""Sometimes you don't feel it coming on for two hours, and you end up eating more. And sometimes the dose with these edibles is half a cookie, or a quarter of a cookie. And I don't know too many people who can eat only half a cookie,"" says Holland. Part of it is the difficulty of gauging the dose; part of it is simple metabolism, she adds. ""Your liver metabolizes THC into 11-hydroxy-THC, and 11-hydroxy-THC is very psychedelic. It's very altering."" Of course, for many people, getting ""altered"" is the whole point. A growing number of young people eschew joints and even Cannabis Cup-quality buds to get high inhaling the smoke from concentrated oils with a THC content of 50% or more. ""Some people are just interested in smoking gigantic amounts of marijuana,"" says Simunek. The trend is hard to quantify, but there are countless YouTube videos of people smoking concentrates, and Thurstone says it's common among young people who enter his clinic. ""Most people are going to be fine,"" says Gitlow, the addiction specialist, ""but there still will be that 10% of people who are going to get as high as they possibly can.""

"(CNN)Rita McCann still remembers the day when her joy at the prospect of giving birth to her first child turned into sheer terror. It was December 15th, 1957 when she went into labor at a hospital in Dublin, Ireland. As she floated in and out of consciousness, she remembers being taken into a room with a single bed. ""I was pulled to the bottom of the bed. My legs were strapped into stirrups. I was nine months pregnant, flat on my back,"" she says. ""I was helpless and I did not know what was going to happen."" ""[Then] I got a local anesthetic and the torture began."" As a room full of medical students and doctors looked on, McCann says she could feel the pressure of a scalpel cutting into her. From then on, it was ""just agony, literally agony,"" she recalls. ""I got a cramp down my left side and I could not move at all to get myself any relief."" McCann, struggling against the searing pain, couldn't see what the surgeon was doing to her. She assumed he was performing a Caesarian section, but he wasn't. He was slicing into her pelvis to make way for her baby. McCann, now 88, was undergoing a symphysiotomy -- a procedure seldom used by other industrialized nations by the mid-20th century as Caesarian sections became safer. Symphysiotomy is a surgical procedure whereby the pubic symphysis -- the joint that holds the pelvis together -- is cut in order to widen the birth canal during labor. Roughly 1,500 women in Ireland were subjected to symphysiotomy between the 1940s and 1984, according to the government. The procedure can cause chronic pain and ""rupturing of the bladder,"" which can lead to incontinence, according to Irish physiotherapist Jessica O'Dowd. In cases where the pubic symphysis is completely severed, patients may get ""earlier onset arthritis and joint degeneration,"" O'Dowd says. ""The mechanics of your whole lower half of your body are changed because of that joint."" McCann says she never consented to the procedure, which she says has left a permanent gap in her pelvis. The operation amounts to torture, according to survivors who have demanded an official apology from the Irish government and an independent inquiry. ""Above all, women want the truth about these operations. They have been denied the truth for 40, 50, 60 years,"" says Marie O'Connor, the chairwoman of Survivors of Symphysiotomy (SoS). A brief filed by the survivors' group to the U.N. Human Rights Committee recounted some of the mothers' horrifying experiences under the knife. ""I just remember being brought into a theatre and the place was packed with people. I wasn't told what was happening ... I was screaming and being restrained,"" recalled Philomena, a pubiotomy patient and SoS member who recalled the birth of her third child in 1959, at the same hospital where Rita McCann had given birth two years before. ""I couldn't see much except for them sawing. It was excruciating pain,"" she said. ""I was just 27 and I was butchered."" Cora, another SoS member, says she was just 17 when doctors performed a pubiotomy (a procedure related to symphysiotomy) on her during the birth of her first child in 1972. ""I was screaming. It's not working, [the anesthetic] I said, I can feel everything ... I seen him go and take out a proper hacksaw, like a wood saw ... a half-circle with a straight blade and a handle,"" she said. ""The blood shot up to the ceiling, up onto his glasses, all over the nurses... Then he goes to the table, and gets something like a solder iron and puts it on me, and stopped the bleeding. ... They told me to push her out. She must have been out before they burnt me. He put the two bones together, there was a burning pain, I knew I was going to die."" Campaigners have accused the doctors, who worked primarily in Catholic hospitals, of putting their religious beliefs before the well-being of patients. ""The surgery was an abuse of power, a pre-emptive surgical strike against the practice of birth control by obstetricians who disliked Caesarean section, on account of its association with what Archbishop [of Dublin Charles] McQuaid termed the 'crime of birth-prevention,"" O'Connor wrote in 2012. McQuaid was Archbishop of Dublin until 1972 and died the next year. CNN reached out to Ireland's Department of Health for comment and was referred to the government-commissioned inquiry from 2013. That report acknowledged the influence of religion on obstetricians in a Catholic country where birth control was illegal from 1935 to 1980. It notes that Alexander Spain and Arthur Barry -- the doctors who championed the procedures at Dublin's National Maternity Hospital in the 1940s and 50s - were ""devout Catholics, serving a predominantly Catholic patient population, and they made no secret of their willing conformity to religious precepts in the treatment of patients."" But the report also acknowledged the legal limits on medical practitioners at the time. ""Whatever their personal inclinations or beliefs, doctors practising in Ireland were confined by key legislative limits in relation to family planning and advice,"" the report noted. The U.N. Human Rights Committee last summer asked Ireland to conduct a ""prompt, independent and thorough"" inquiry into symphiosotomy. In July, as a result of the government-commissioned inquiry, Ireland launched an ""ex-gratia"" scheme -- one that allowed for payment without admission of liability -- to compensate victims with payments ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 euros, depending on the severity of the case. But Marie O'Connor says the government's offer doesn't do nearly enough for women who were physically and emotionally crippled by the procedures at state hospitals for decades. ""That is a sum of money that anybody would get here if they broke a leg at work,"" she says. ""It seems to us that what the state is trying to do is buy off survivors at the lowest possible cost,"" she says. ""The payment scheme is an ex-gratia scheme, which does not meet international human rights standards because it is based on no admission of wrongdoing."" She says some women are pursuing legal action. Rita McCann, one of the roughly 300 victims who is still alive, is not among those looking to the courts. And although she didn't find out about what had happened to her for decades, she says she has felt the effects of her symphysiotomy since the day it happened. When McCann left the hospital, she says she could barely walk for the first six months, and she had to move back home to Monaghan in north Ireland so her parents could help raise the baby. ""To walk or to lift the baby, my back would just go into a spasm, and my legs wouldn't work,"" she says. ""Basically you were crawling around holding on ... and that lasted for a long, long time."" As bad as the pain was, McCann claims that she wasn't told about the procedure, and says that ""secrecy"" hurt even worse. ""He was obviously sawing me in half,"" she says. ""Why they couldn't come and tell me?"" ""It left me feeling guilt and it left me wondering on what effect it would have on my baby later in life. It was having a very bad effect on me so it was bound to have some effect on the baby."" ""It never dawned on me that there was an alternative,"" she says. ""But I think I would have taken the Caesarian."" Before McCann lost consciousness on that terrifying night at the hospital more than 57 years ago, she recalled the surgeon telling a student, ""When she has a fine baby boy or girl in the morning, she will forget all about it."" But she says she can't erase the devastating impact of her symphysiotomy. ""It has been a lifetime,"" she says. ""It's been a life sentence.""","1,500 women in Ireland were subjected to symphysiotomy operations from the 1940s to 80s .

"Vice President Joe Biden will be in Iowa on Sunday, which will once again trigger speculation he may make a run for the White House in 2016. Biden will headline the annual steak fry put on by longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. The event, which dates nearly four decades, is one of the signature events for Iowa Democrats, drawing top politicians, and it has a rich history of attracting presidential hopefuls. Biden has not said whether he'll make a third run for the Democratic presidential nomination. He launched unsuccessful bids in 1988 and 2008. ""I can die a happy man never having been president of the United States of America. But it doesn't mean I won't run,"" Biden said in a July interview with GQ magazine. As for his timetable, he told CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger earlier this year that ""I haven't made that decision. And I don't have to make that decision for a while."" But a trip to one of the crucial early voting states like Iowa, which kicks off the presidential caucus and primary calendar, sets off alarm bells among political watchers. Biden to South Carolina--again . There were a number of stories last month when Biden teamed with President Barack Obama at a campaign style event on education in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Biden was born. The event didn't go unnoticed by the Republican National Committee, which posted a web video in advance that characterized the rally as the first step in the ""Biden 2016 kickoff tour."" At the event Obama praised Biden, noting it was the fifth anniversary of joining the Democratic ticket. Obama said it was ""the best decision I ever made politically."" Until last month, the RNC and pro-Republican groups had been concentrating firepower mostly on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. If she decides to run for the White House again, Clinton would be considered the Democratic frontrunner. Biden last appeared at the steak fry in Indianola in 2007. Then a senator from Delaware, Biden shared the stage with  Obama, Clinton, Chris Dodd, John Edwards and Bill Richardson. Biden was supposed to headline last year's fry, but couldn't make it. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who's also considered a possible 2016 contender, was the keynote speaker. Biden aides say he is showing up this year to honor a commitment he made to Harkin, a five-term senator who's retiring after next year. Speaking with Iowa reporters on Thursday, Harkin said its way ""too early to speculate"" about Biden's prospects, but he added ""Joe Biden's always had good support among Iowa Democrats. He's very popular in a number of areas around the state."" According to local reports, Harkin also said Biden ""has a long history of working with Iowa Democrats, so I think that he would find - how should I phrase it? - fertile ground in Iowa if he should choose to run."" Biden finished a distant fifth in the 2008 Iowa caucuses. The 2014 race to succeed Harkin will be competitive, and a couple of congressional contests in the Hawkeye state will also attract national attention. ""This trip is really about the 2014 election rather than about 2016,"" Larry Rasky, a longtime senior political adviser to Biden, told CNN. He pointed to a fundraiser later this month in the nation's capital that Biden is headlining for Jim Mowrer, who's challenging conservative Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King next year, to highlight the vice president's efforts to help elect fellow Democrats in the midterms. While touting those efforts, Rasky also conceded that ""you can stop people from speculating. The vice president obviously hasn't taken 2016 off the table and Iowa's more than a little important."" The White House announced on Thursday that Biden will travel to the Port of Charleston in South Carolina to discuss jobs and infrastructure. Biden is also scheduled to visit the Port of Savannah, Georgia, later that day. While the visit is an official vice presidential trip, South Carolina just happens to be another crucial early voting state, holding the first southern primary in the race for the White House. This will be Biden's second visit to the Palmetto State this year. ""You don't want South Carolinians to feel unloved,"" joked Rasky. Besides visits to the early voting states, another indicator of whether Biden may launch another presidential bid will be his decision on whether to set up a leadership PAC. Such a move could signal that he is taking more of an interest in setting up a possible campaign structure. A Biden political adviser, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said that a leadership PAC is ""still being mulled over."" Speaking before Biden at the steak fry will be San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who's considered a rising young star in the party. Castro, who gave the keynote address at last year's Democratic convention, is also considered a possible 2016 contender. Biden won't be the first sitting vice president to speak at Harkin's event. RadioIowa news director Kay Henderson points out that Vice President Al Gore was the main attraction at the 1995 and 1999 events, before running for president in the 2000 election.","Biden due to attend Iowa fish fry on Sunday hosted by Democratic Sen.

"Jason Stevens remembers all too well the feeling of not being sure where he was. He suffered a concussion during the third game of his high school football season last year, and had to sit out for the rest of the season. ""It felt like the entire helmet was just pressing in your head, like your head was expanding,"" said Jason, 15, of Poughkeepsie, New York. Football teams across the country are getting the message: It's time to tackle concussions. In a landmark move Thursday, thousands of former football players and their families reached a settlement with the National Football League. According to court documents, the NFL will pay $765 million to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses. It's an issue for more than the nation's top football players. There are approximately 1,100,000 teens playing high school football, according to The National Federation of State High School Associations. And in organized youth leagues, there are another 3 million. Concussions result from blows to the head, such as when a player collides with another in a sporting event. ""In a football game, when someone takes a hard hit, the helmet does a pretty good job of protecting the skull from getting a skull fracture,"" Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon and CNN's chief medical correspondent, told Bleacher Report. ""But what is really happening when someone is running down the field and ... they get hit -- the brain keeps moving inside the skull."" It's not so much the hit, although that's important, but the sudden acceleration and deceleration of the brain that causes the concussion, Gupta said. Confusion, nausea, headache and loss of consciousness are some of the immediate symptoms of concussions, but they can also have longer lasting effects. Severe impacts to the head can lead to bleeding or permanent nerve damage. And recent research has shown that repeated hits to the head can lead to a brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. In the 2012 football season, there were two fatalities directly related to football, both in semi-professional football, and both during regularly scheduled games, according to the Annual Survey of Football Injury Research [PDF]. ""In 2012, one of the semi-professional players was hit by a blindsided block on a punt return and the second player was involved in a helmet-to-helmet collision,"" the report said. Among high school football athletes, there were nine indirect fatalities -- one from heat stroke, four related to the heart, two from asthma, one from lighting, and one of an unknown cause. None were impact-related, but earlier this month a teen in Georgia died after he broke his neck while making a tackle during a scrimmage game. Over the last 10 years, an average of fewer than three boys a year have died from on-field injuries playing high school football, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina. More concerning to experts is the repeated hits they're sustaining on the field. A professional football player receives an estimated 900 to 1,500 blows to the head during a single season, according to the Sports Concussion Institute in Los Angeles. How many is that over a lifetime? NFL concussion fast facts . The NFL has initiated strict sideline concussion rules and cognitive tests, to be administered by trainers and doctors who cannot be overruled by coaching staffs. But changes are happening on lower levels as well. The National Federation of State High School Associations Football rules committee approved rule changes earlier this year regarding what should happen when players' helmets come off of their heads during games. To minimize risks, these rules included an illegal personal contact foul mandate: ""No player or nonplayer shall initiate contact with an opposing player whose helmet has come completely off."" Also, it will be illegal ""for a player whose helmet comes completely off during a down to continue to participate beyond the immediate action in which the player is engaged."" Any player whose helmet comes off during the game is also forced to sit out at least one play. The National Federation of State High School Associations announced earlier this month that it has partnered with USA football to endorse a program that promotes high school football player safety. The program is called Heads Up Football, and it currently involves 32 high schools in eight states. In 2014, any high school in the country will be able to participate. High school programs that participate each assign a Player Safety Coach, who is trained by USA Football to instruct coaches, parents and players on specific tackling mechanics. The techniques are aimed at reducing helmet contact, concussion recognition and response protocols, and ensure adequate fitting for helmets and shoulder pads. Heads Up Football will incorporate about 4,000 high school student athletes this year, as well as youth football programs that represent nearly 600,000 youth players in all 50 states and Washington. A lot of schools in the Los Angeles area are requiring pre-season cognitive testing for football players, so that if a player gets a concussion, he can be re-tested and the results can be compared to the original screening, said Sidney Jones, athlete trainer and clinical coordinator at the Sports Concussion Institute. Jones conducts education, pre-injury and post-injury testing throughout the Los Angeles area. ""I think as different things are happening -- whether it's NFL lawsuits, or more media attention on things like concussions -- I think a lot more parents and schools are willing to try to protect their kids a little bit more, and get more education,"" she said. Jones has found that many student athletes -- she mainly works with children 18 and under -- do not know the risks of concussions. She educates them about prevention and symptoms. She keeps it basic and does not talk about the long-term risks of concussions that have been getting a lot of attention in research. That's because, in her view, ""We don't have the research available to us yet to actually concretely say anything."" Some parents are taking matters into their own hands. Jason's mother, Erika Stevens, wasn't satisfied with the normal training on her son's team, so she hired a personal trainer to help him avoid concussions in the future. He's learned how to properly hit, and when to let the play go, over the past couple of months, she said. ""We hope that it makes him a smarter player."" Jason said his team passed out new football helmets this season that are designed to minimize the risk of concussion more than old ones this season. He got one because of his injury last year. Jason suffered attention problems in school for months after his concussion, and sat closer to the front of the class than normal because of eyesight difficulties, his mother said. Training for this season -- his first since the injury -- began August 19. His mother is nervous about him suffering another concussion, but Jason is not. Still, they've agreed: ""If he does get another concussion, then football's done,"" Stevens said.","There are approximately 1,100,000 teens playing high school football .
Confusion, nausea, headache are some of the symptoms of concussions .
NFL players receive an estimated 900 to 1,500 blows to the head each season .

"Manila (CNN)Flags were flown at half-staff in the Philippines Friday as the nation observed a day of mourning for 44 police commandos killed in a disastrous operation in the country's Muslim south. The officers, members of the police's elite Special Action Force (SAF) unit, were killed in a 12-hour firefight with two Muslim rebel groups in the southern province of Maguindanao at the weekend. Their 392-strong team had been deployed to hunt two ""most wanted"" terror suspects. The fallen police were farewelled by grieving family members, politicians and police and military leadership at their home base, Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City Friday. Policemen across the country wore black armbands to show their sympathy. Delivering a eulogy for the fallen, President Benigno Aquino III made reference to his own loss as the son of an assassinated political leader, and vowed to bring the remaining target of the commandos' mission to justice. ""Our 44 fallen heroes from our police force, the youngest at 26 and the most senior at 39 years old, pushed themselves and exerted all their effort to do what they could, not only for themselves and their families, but for our beloved country,"" he said. ""They gave up their lives for the kind of peace and order that endures."" The president's father, Benigno Aquino, Jr., was a Filipino senator who was assassinated at Manila International Airport in 1983. The officers had been pursuing two ""high value"" terrorist bomb makers, including the senior Jemaah Islamiyah figure Zulkifli bin Hir, also known as Marwan, when they came under assault. Marwan, a Malaysian suspected of being behind the 2002 Bali bombings, has a $5 million U.S. government bounty on his head. Philippine authorities say they believe he was killed in the raid, but are yet to conduct DNA testing to confirm this. Previous reports of his death have proven false. The unit's other target, Filipino bomb maker Abdul Basit Usman, escaped. Aquino swore during the eulogy that Usman would be brought to justice. ""Capturing Basit Usman is number one on our list of priorities,"" he said. ""I assure you, we will get Usman."" Police Chief Superintendent Noli G. Talino, deputy director of the Special Action Force, delivered a speech recounting how the satisfaction of the assault on Marwan soured as the commandos became pinned down during the extraction. He recalled hearing the voice of a colleague on the radio asking for reinforcements, as they became surrounded by armed rebels. ""I felt guilty ... about what happened in the field, and it seems our efforts were not enough to extend the help that they have asked for. But we did our best,"" he said. ""Is it worth it? One international terrorist equivalent to 44 SAF troopers? I'm sure if you will ask them, it is worth it."" The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years. Last year, it signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest rebel group in the region. The MILF agreed to end hostilities in return for the establishment of a more autonomous Muslim region in the south. But hardline splinter groups, such as the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), have not signed any peace deal. The police commandos engaged in battle with both groups during the firefight near Mamasapano town, Maguindanao Province, last weekend. Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government Mar Roxas said that the commandos were retreating from the assault on their targets when they came under fire from members of the BIFF. In maneuvering away from the BIFF assault, they strayed into territory controlled by the MILF, and further fighting ensued. On Wednesday, Aquino delivered a speech to the nation vowing that the deaths would not derail the deal with the MILF, saying the fallen police had given their lives for the cause of peace. ""If the peace process were derailed, how many more graves would we have to dig?"" he said. ""How many more children will idolize Marwan? How many will want to grow up to be Usman? How many engineers will choose to build bombs rather than buildings?"" he said. A board of inquiry is looking into why the mission went wrong. The SAF has been criticized for not coordinating adequately with the MILF ahead of the mission. But Benigno said in his speech that ""even if the MILF and BIFF now constitute two different groups, many of them are related by blood or by affinity. Strangers cannot just enter their territory. Our troops needed to enter quietly and carefully; otherwise, their targets may have been alerted."" The MILF issued a statement Wednesday on behalf of its chairman Al Haj Murad Ebrahim. The statement reiterated the MILF's ""full commitment"" to the peace process, extended sympathies to the families of the fallen police and announced its own investigation into the incident. ""In order to give meaning to their deaths, we must resolve not to let something like this happen again,"" read the statement.","44 dead police commandos are honored in a day of mourning in the Philippines .

"Beleaguered New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner got into a war of words Wednesday with a man who lashed out at him for being ""married to an Arab,"" in addition to chastising the former congressman about his well-documented sexting scandal. The incident began inside a bakery in Brooklyn's Borough Park neighborhood, where the man yelled out to Weiner, who had just bought cookies and an iced coffee, ""You're a real scumbag."" Weiner offered a quick retort, then said to no one in particular, ""Very nice, that's a charming guy right there."" It's then that the man, later identified as Saul Kessler, responded: ""Married to an Arab."" The comment is an apparent reference to Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, who works for Hillary Clinton. Abedin's late father was an Islamic scholar from India and her mother, a sociologist, is from Pakistan. Weiner is Jewish, as were most of those inside the Brooklyn bakery. Huma Abedin emerges, stands by her husband . The Democratic candidate responded with, ""Very nice, in front of children... That is charming."" Kessler didn't stop talking, even as Weiner was leaving the bakery, saying, ""You are disgusting, disgusting."" ""It takes one to know one, jackass,"" Weiner replied. The two then went face-to-face, with Kessler accusing Weiner -- who resigned in disgrace after 12 years in Congress representing part of New York City after admitting to sending sexually suggestive images and carrying on inappropriate relationships with women over the Internet -- of doing ""disgusting things, and you have the nerve to even walk around in public."" A visibly agitated Weiner responded,""And you're a perfect person? You're my judge? What rabbi taught you that?"" At one point, Kessler implored Weiner to ""think about your wife, how could you take the person you're most closest to ... and betray her?"" The mayoral hopeful then accused Kessler of acting like he is superior, even though he doesn't ""have the moral authority to judge me."" Weiner: Hate media? Love me . The back-and-forth went on for about a minute longer before Weiner left the bakery. He seemed to quickly brush off the confrontation, saying, ""He has every right to (challenge me). It's America."" The Weiner campaign released a video of Wednesday's exchange, a version of which also was captured by blogger Jacob Kornbluh. Talking with reporters later in the day, Weiner described what happened as ""just some enthusiastic exchange with a voter."" ""Look, you're allowed to say stuff to me,"" said Weiner, who, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday, trails three other Democratic candidates ahead of next week's primary. ""But if you're going to say vile things about me and my family, you should expect that I'm going to go back at you. ""Hecklers don't get a chance to necessarily get the last word if they cross the line."" Reached by CNN later in the day, Kessler admitted calling out Weiner for being ""married to an Arab."" ""It's just a certain feeling I have as a Jew,"" said the 51-year-old real estate manager, explaining his remark. ""And my attitude is that -- not all Arabs -- but, in general, ... they want to kill every Jew."" Kessler said of a Jewish person marrying into such a family: ""It's like a betrayal."" Kessler also said Weiner has bothered him for some time. Kessler called him a ""phony."" But Kessler said he should have acted differently. ""(Given that I felt) a little bit of anger, I probably shouldn't have said it,"" Kessler said about the Arab comment. ""I shouldn't have called him a scumbag."" ""But it was in the heat of the moment."" Is Huma Abedin blaming herself?","Weiner says hecklers should expect he'll go at them if they say ""vile things""

"Just don't call it a coup. Appearing to throw its weight behind an opposition that swarmed Cairo's Tahrir Square, the Egyptian military told the country's civilian government it has until Wednesday evening to ""meet the demands of the people"" or it will step in to restore order. In a statement carried nationwide on radio and television, the military called the 48-hour ultimatum ""a final chance to shoulder the burden of a historic moment in our country."" But a military spokesman said late Monday that the culture of the armed forces -- which dominated the country for decades -- ""doesn't allow it to adopt the policy of military coups."" The statement was meant to push all factions toward quick solutions and a national consensus, and the armed forces aren't looking to be part of the political or ruling circles, the spokesman, Col. Ahmed Ali, said in written statement. While insisting they want no direct role in national politics, the generals appeared instead to be pressuring Mohamed Morsy,  Egypt's first freely elected president, to restructure his government. The steps could include reducing the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood in his cabinet and calling early presidential and parliamentary elections, a source close to highly placed members of Egypt's leadership told CNN. The protesters in Tahrir Square, who listened to the military statement on radios and cell phones, cheered as it was read. They roared as military helicopters passed overhead at dusk, trailing Egyptian flags and the banners of the armed services. After nightfall, they waved flags, honked horns and set off fireworks. ""Everyone is talking as if Morsy is officially out of power and the Brotherhood is officially out of power, and everyone is celebrating,"" Bassem Sabry, an Egyptian writer who took part in Monday's protests, told CNN's Connect the World. But Morsy's office said early Tuesday that the military statement ""has not yet been reviewed"" by the president, adding ""Egypt, by all its power, will not allow the country to go backwards under any circumstances."" In the face of the protests, which began over the weekend, five government ministers announced their resignations Monday. The latest was Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, Egypt's official MENA news agency reported. Morsy, a U.S.-educated Islamist, was elected Egypt's president in June 2012. He resigned his post as leader of the Freedom and Justice Party, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, after winning office, but critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian over his year in power. And he has failed to revive Egypt's economy, which crashed when the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak drove tourists away. That's disaffected many of his supporters among Egypt's poor and middle classes, said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics. ""That some of the revolutionaries are calling on the army to return to politics is a testament to how polarized Egypt is a year after the election of Morsy,"" Gerges said. ""Think of the millions of people who cheered Morsy after his election. Think of the millions of Egyptians who pinned their hopes on Morsy. A year later, now, the millions of Egyptians who cheered for Morsy are saying he must go."" Gerges called Morsy ""incompetent"" and ""a president who is basically his own worst enemy."" But he doubted the military would actually step in to depose him, which he said ""would plunge Egypt into a greater legal political and institutional crisis."" Shortly after the military's announcement, Morsy met with Prime Minister Hisham Qandil and Egypt's minister of defense and head of the country's military, Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi, according to the president's Facebook page. It was not immediately known what they discussed, and a late-night news conference planned by the president's office was canceled. The source who discussed the issue with CNN said the military is asking Morsy's government to reduce the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood and focus on a governing style credible to the majority. Gerges said those changes could include the appointment of an opposition figure as prime minister, the appointment of a new prosecutor-general and opposition-backed amendments to the country's constitution, which voters approved in December. The Muslim Brotherhood was repressed under Mubarak but is now the most powerful political force in Egypt. Last week, El-Sisi said the army would, if necessary, ""prevent Egypt from slipping into a dark tunnel of civil unrest and killing, sectarianism and the collapse of state institutions."" The opposition Tamarod (""rebel"") Campaign called for nationwide protests, civil disobedience and a march on the presidential palace if Morsy doesn't leave office by Tuesday. Demonstrators say they have collected 17 million signatures -- roughly 4 million more than the number of votes that won Morsy the presidency -- calling for Morsy to go. The opposition is made up of various groups and loose coalitions, and not all anti-Morsy protesters agree with the road map the Tamarod campaign is advocating. Some are loyal to the ousted Mubarak government, while others want the army to intervene. That's brought criticism from observers like Mohamad Elmasry, a journalism professor at the American University in Cairo, who says much of the movement is anti-democratic and elitist. ""The Muslim Brotherhood has made plenty of mistakes,"" Elmasry told CNN. ""But in medicine, they talk about triaging. If someone goes into the emergency room with a gunshot wound to the chest and a broken arm, the doctors treat the gunshot wound to the chest, not the broken arm."" ""The Brotherhood might be a broken arm with their mistakes,"" he said, but ""this anti-democratic tendency within these circles that is the gunshot wound to the democratic chest, if you will, of Egypt."" AbdulMawgoud Dardery, a former member of parliament and a Muslim Brotherhood representative,  told CNN's Amanpour program that the military could be an ""honest broker"" in a national dialogue. He said Morsy has reached out to opposition leaders many times, but the opposition ""is afraid of democracy."" ""It failed in the previous five elections we had in Egypt since the revolution, and they don't want to fail a sixth time,"" he said. ""That's why they're going to street politics. Street politics is not an end in itself. It is a means to achieve democracy. But they're not willing to go toward a democratic system."" On Monday, protesters stormed the main headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the party that Morsy led before his election. Armed with Molotov cocktails, the mob set the office on fire, shouting, ""The people have toppled the regime."" At least 16 people were killed and more than 780 were wounded Sunday and Monday during the unrest in Egypt, the nation's health minister said, according to the official Egypt News agency. On Friday, Andrew Pochter, a 21-year-old American in Alexandria to teach children English, was stabbed to death while watching the demonstrations, his family said. U.S. student killed in Egypt was enthralled with region . Dr. Mohammed Mustafa Hamid told the news agency that eight people alone were killed in clashes at the Muslim Brotherhood's national headquarters in Cairo. All but 182 of the wounded have left the hospital after receiving treatment for their injuries. State-funded Egyptian daily Al-Ahram also reported 46 sexual assaults during anti-Morsy protests in Egypt since Sunday, citing volunteer group Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment. Governments issue warnings against travel to Egypt . Opponents say Morsy's policies also are to blame for a breakdown in law and order and for a gas shortage that has Egyptians waiting at the pumps for hours. Monday's military statement seemed to adopt the protesters' perspective, calling the crisis a grave threat to national security while praising demonstrators as determined and admirable. ""Wasting more time will only lead to more division and fighting which we have and continue to warn against,"" the military said in its statement. iReport: Protesters flood Cairo's streets . Morsy's supporters held smaller rallies Monday in other parts of Cairo. Some of them said he is the people's choice, that he inherited a broken system and should be given time to fix it. ""We're not leaving, and the president is staying,"" one supporter told CNN. ""We believe in democracy. If people don't like him, they can vote him out in three years."" Dardery said Monday that the party might support early parliamentary elections. But he said the nation elected Morsy to a four-year term and should stand by that. To do otherwise would disrupt the country's nascent democracy, he said. ""It is not fair. It is not fair to a democracy,"" he said. The developments were being closely watched around the region and in the United States, Egypt's leading ally. Speaking in Africa, U.S. President Barack Obama noted the protests and their demands. ""Our commitment to Egypt has never been around any particular individual or party. Our commitment has been to a process,"" he said. Washington provided tens of billions of dollars in military and economic aid to Egypt under Mubarak and pledged $1 billion to the post-Mubarak government. Pentagon spokesman George Little told reporters Monday that the U.S. Defense Department is reviewing the latest statement from the Egyptian military, but no one is sure what will happen ""one way or the other"" in the next two days.

"Orbital Sciences Corp. sent up its first entry into the space freight business Wednesday with the launch of a new unmanned cargo carrier to the International Space Station. It's the first flight for the company's Cygnus spacecraft and the second for its Antares booster rocket. Liftoff was at 10:58 a.m. at NASA's launch facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, about 90 miles north of Norfolk. About 10 minutes after launch, a cheer went up in the company's flight control room in Dulles, Virginia, outside Washington, when the craft separated from the second stage of the booster. Its solar arrays deployed successfully about 15 minutes later. ""The spacecraft is working really well right now,"" Frank Culbertson, the head of Orbital's advanced programs group and a former astronaut, told reporters after the launch. Cygnus is slated to perform three days of tests before being cleared to approach the ISS and it's scheduled to rendezvous with the space station until Sunday. The launch had been scheduled for Tuesday, but was postponed for a day because of bad weather and a technical glitch that delayed the craft's roll-out on Friday, NASA said. Unlike the SpaceX Dragon capsule, which is designed to be reused and eventually carry passengers, the can-shaped, 17-foot Cygnus is a one-shot craft that will burn up on re-entry after its flight to the space station. It carried about 1,500 pounds of cargo into orbit on Wednesday, but is capable of carrying up to 4,400 pounds (2,000 kilos), the company says. After about a month, the craft will be packed with trash from the station and cut loose to burn up in the atmosphere, Culbertson said. ""It's going to be an exciting and fascinating and interesting time for everybody involved,"" he said. NASA hired Orbital and SpaceX to start making cargo runs to the space station after retiring its fleet of space shuttles and turning much of its focus toward exploring deep into the solar system. Orbital has a $1.9 billion contract with NASA to make eight flights to the space station under the space agency's commercial supply program. ""We look forward to the rendezvous with the station on Sunday, and with that we'll have Orbital joining SpaceX as one of our providers,"" NASA Associate Administrator Robert Lightfoot said. SpaceX has so far made two of its 12 scheduled flights to the ISS under a $1.6 billion contract.","Orbital Sciences successfully launched its Cygnus cargo ship Wednesday .

"Nasrin Sotoudeh, a prominent Iranian human rights advocate, was among several prisoners released Wednesday from a Tehran prison where she had been jailed since 2010. ""I'm glad, but I'm worried for my friends in prison,"" she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in a telephone interview soon after her release, citing other political and human rights activists who remain in prison. Sotoudeh said authorities at the notorious Evin Prison initially told her she would be allowed out on a short break. They then put her into a car. It was only after she had been driven out of the gates that one of the prison heads told her, ""No, you are free forever, and that's why we're taking you home,"" she said. The prison in the capital's northwest section had been her home since she was convicted of acting against national security and other charges related to her work in defending Iranians who were detained after the 2009 elections, which returned Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the presidency. She was reunited with her husband, Reza Khandan, and her two children. As a prisoner, Sotoudeh had gone on a hunger strike to express her anger over the effect that her 11-year sentence was having on her family, she said. The term included five years for ""acting against national security;"" another five years for not wearing a hijab -- a head covering worn by Muslim women -- during a videotaped message; and an additional year for ""propaganda against the regime,"" the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran reported. Sotoudeh's release comes just days before world leaders, including Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had urged Iran to free jailed opposition leaders, journalists and human rights activists in 2012. In 2011, a U.S. State Department spokesman called Sotoudeh ""a strong voice for rule of law and justice in Iran."" Washington praised her release and challenged Rouhani to follow up on it by freeing ""all prisoners of conscience,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. ""President Rouhani pledged repeatedly during his campaign to restore and expand freedoms for all Iranians, and called for expanded political and social freedoms, including freedom of expression,"" Harf said in a written statement. ""In the months ahead, we hope he will continue to keep his promises to the Iranian people."" Sotoudeh told CNN she expected to be allowed to continue practicing as a lawyer after her release. Asked if she considered it to be a new day for Iran, she noted that ""many political prisoners"" remain in jail. ""But I hope that this will be a new day,"" she said. In an earlier telephone interview, Khandan said his wife, who is a lawyer, had another three years of her sentence remaining and he had not been told whether her release was final. But Sotoudeh said that her freedom was not temporary. ""Free forever,"" she said. Sotoudeh was the attorney for Arash Rahmanipour, one of two men executed by the Islamic republic in early 2010. He was accused of being an enemy of God and belonging to a banned opposition group. In 2012, she shared the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Human Rights.

"The Bangladesh Supreme Court has sentenced a prominent leader of the country's largest Islamist party to death for ""crimes against humanity,"" the official Bangladeshi news agency BSS reported Tuesday. The ruling in the case of Abdul Quader Mollah, who was the assistant secretary general for the now-banned Jamaat-e-Islami party, set off rioting in the streets and prompted the party to announce a two-day general strike across the country beginning Wednesday. ""The appeal filed by the state has been allowed, while the appeal filed on behalf of Abdul Quader Mollah has been rejected,"" Chief Justice Md. Mozzammel Hossain, who led a five-member Appellate Division bench of the Supreme Court, announced Tuesday. In February, Mollah was sentenced to life in prison by a tribunal that convicted him of war crimes. iReport: American says he would die for justice in Bangladesh . The panel was set up by the government to bring to justice some of those accused of atrocities during Bangladesh's 1971 war for independence. Its decision not to sentence Mollah to death set off huge protests earlier this year in Dhaka, the capital. The demonstrations prompted parliament to change the law to allow the government to appeal rulings by the tribunal, which is what happened in Mollah's case. The prosecutor said the latest court ruling left no room for further review, but defense attorney Abdur Razzak, who is also a Jamaat leader, said he would seek an appeal. Law minister Shafique Ahmed said only clemency from the president could spare Mollah. Attorney General Mahbubey Alam told journalists that the death sentence against Mollah was for his role in the brutal killings of a man, his pregnant wife and 2-year-old son in 1971. Following the tougher sentence against him issued Tuesday by the top court, Jamaat supporters took to the streets, spurring unrest that left at least 10 people injured, CNN affiliate Boishakhi TV reported. The station aired footage of cars on fire, including a police van in the seaside city of Chittagong. Read more: Bangladesh high court declares rules against Islamic party . Jamaat, a major ally of the main opposition party Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is a constant thorn in the side of the ruling Awami League. The high court declared Jaamat's registration illegal last month, preventing it from taking part in the country's upcoming general election.  The party has appealed the ruling. Monday, Bangladesh's cabinet approved an amendment to an elections bill that bars anyone convicted of war crimes from participating in national elections. Jaamat enjoys considerable support, particularly in rural areas. And periodically, it mobilizes its adherents in large-scale demonstrations in Dhaka to show its strength. But it has faced pressure from the Awami League and progressive groups that point to Jammat's role during Bangladesh's struggle for independence from Pakistan. Between one million and 3 million people were killed in the nine-month war. The International Crimes Tribunal, the court set up by the government in 2010, has convicted several other top Jamaat leaders of crimes against humanity. Jamaat acknowledges that it opposed Bangladesh's struggle for independence, but it has decried what it calls a smear campaign. It has also questioned why the Awami League is only now pressing forward on war crimes trials when it didn't do so while in power during the 1970s and 1990s.","Jaamat-e-Islami calls for two-day general strike .

"(CNN)Rand Paul kicks off his Texas swing this weekend with a top endorsement and a key addition to his political operation, announcing that Texas GOP Chairman Steve Munisteri will become an adviser to Paul's team. As campaigns start taking shape ahead of the 2016 Republican presidential race, Paul's alliance with Munisteri is notable given the throng of other potential contenders with ties to Texas, a state rich in campaign cash. Munisteri will resign his role with the state party on Friday to join Team Rand, he said in a statement issued on Thursday. The Wall Street Journal first reported the story on Thursday evening. As chairman since 2010, Munisteri will bring with him a sizable rolodex and intricate knowledge of the reliably red state.Texas is expected to hold its primary on March 1, 2016, and given the crowded field of potential candidates, it could play an influential role in the contest for the Republican nomination. Munisteri said he's supporting Paul, whom he' known for 33 years, in part because of the Kentucky Republican's strategy to court nontraditional GOP voters, like African-Americans and young people, according to The Wall Street Journal. ""Paul shares my vision of promoting the conservative values of individual freedom, limited government, a strong national defense and defense of the Constitution in each and every community in our country,"" the chairman said. Munisteri gained a reputation for being fair and inclusive, said Dallas County GOP Wade Emmert, who's running to replace the chairman. ""This is a real coup for Rand Paul,"" Emmert said, noting that Munisteri brings ""instant credibility"" in Texas. While Paul was raised in Texas and attended Baylor University -- his father, ex-Rep. Ron Paul, represented a district near of Houston for 23 years -- a number of his potential contenders also have deep roots in the Lone Star State. Rick Perry, for example, just stepped down as the state's longest serving governor. Munisteri backed Perry's presidential bid in 2012. Sen. Ted Cruz won a longshot victory in a heated Texas primary battle nearly three years ago and has since become a conservative firebrand in Congress. (Paul's campaign recently nabbed Cruz's digital strategist, Vincent Harris.) Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was also raised in Texas, and his son, George P. Bush, recently won statewide office as Texas Land Commissioner, while his brother, former President George W. Bush, served as governor of the state before Perry. SEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton is beating Mitt Romney on Twitter . Even Chris Christie has slipped into the Texas mix, with his now famous adoration for the Dallas Cowboys and cozy friendship with owner Jerry Jones. Christie also recently hired Ray Washburne, a Texas local and former national finance chairman for the Republican National Committee, for his own political action committee. And renowned retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson recently hired attorney Terry Giles from Houston. Paul, however, has signaled that he'll be vying for as much attention as he can get in Texas. He's set to open an office in Austin, and he's returning to the Dallas-Ft. Worth area this weekend to speak at a Dallas County GOP event on Friday, followed by a Tarrant County GOP event on Saturday. He spoke at the Texas GOP convention last June, and earlier in 2014 he challenged Lone State Republicans to push for expanding the party's base. ""Texas will be a Democratic state within 10 years if you don't change,"" he said.","Rand Paul's team is adding the Texas GOP chairman as an adviser .

"(CNN)The deepening of the shipping channel in Savannah, Georgia, won't be dredging up just mud and sand. It will be raising up a link to the past: an ironclad that protected the city during the Civil War until the vessel met its undignified demise. For about the next nine months, divers will be working to bring up the CSS Georgia, piece by rusted piece, from nearly 40 feet down in the Savannah River. The $706 million harbor deepening officially began Thursday with speeches and the firing of an old cannon at Old Fort Jackson near the wreck site. The removal of the CSS Georgia is necessary for the state and federal project, which will see the channel go from 42 to 47 feet so massive cargo container ships can use the port without relying on the tide. While some material from the Confederate vessel was recovered after the war, four artillery pieces, parts of the propeller and propulsion system, a boiler and two casemates, which housed the artillery pieces, remain in the swift, dark waters.  One of the casemates is huge: 68 feet by 24 feet. ""She is really in large sections scattered throughout the bottom down there,"" Julie Morgan, archaeologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Savannah, told CNN affiliate WSAV. The CSS Georgia didn't have enough power to maneuver and effectively trade artillery rounds with any enemy vessels that might approach from the Atlantic Ocean. Instead, the vessel became a stationary floating battery, bristling with artillery pieces. The Yankees refused to take on the CSS Georgia or other nearby defense obstructions. The CSS Georgia won the battle, but lost the war: The vessel was scuttled in December 1864 shortly before Union forces took Savannah and presented the city to President Abraham Lincoln as a Christmas present. The shipwreck has rested in the river since, rarely disturbed and having weathered the indignity of being hit during dredging a couple of times over the years. Recovery of the ironclad will cost between $14 million and $15 million, Corps officials said. Contract divers have been at the site and are first mapping, tagging and putting a recovery grid in place. A network of ropes connects wreck site artifacts and helps divers navigate the river floor. They will be recovering small artifacts, such as fasteners or small personal items. The second phase, expected to begin in May or June, will be the recovery of the large pieces. U.S. Navy and other divers will take special care because of the possibility of live ammunition and powder. Gordon Watts of Panamerican Consultants told affiliate WTOC that in at least the first phase, only one diver will be underwater at a time. ""For every person we have on the bottom, there's four more people up on the surface that are tending him, talking to him and being sure that whatever he is doing is safe,"" said Watts. Archaeologists have the challenge of preserving portions of the CSS Georgia through chemical and other means, making her iron stable so  the remains one day can be displayed. Conservation of selected artifacts and parts of the CSS Georgia will be done at Texas A&M University and will take about two years to complete. The remains of the CSS Georgia may answer some mysteries, including its dimensions and the manner of construction. The casemates were made of railroad iron. The vessel could handle 10 guns, though fewer were onboard when it was destroyed. There are no known blueprints for the ironclad, which was produced in Savannah in 1862 as part of a defensive naval squadron. Former U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia, speaking at Thursday's kickoff, said the harbor deepening is important for the state's economy, jobs and recognition of its history. While officials have made no determination of where CSS Georgia artifacts may eventually reside, Kingston believes they should stay in Savannah, perhaps at Old Fort Jackson. ""We need it to stay here. It will help Savannah in terms of tourism. It will help tell our story. It will enhance our reputation from an historical viewpoint. We need to make sure it does stay local,"" he said, reported WSAV. Besides deepening the channel of the Savannah River, the Corps will extend the shipping lane an additional 7 miles in the Atlantic Ocean off Tybee Island. On the river-based portion, the Corps will be installing a dissolved oxygen injection system to protect marine life.","$706 million harbor deepening officially begins in Savannah, Georgia .

"(CNN)Lawyers for two Australian men on death row in Indonesia attempted to throw them a legal lifeline on Friday, despite the government's recent insistence that there is no way out. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, aged 31 and 33 respectively, were sentenced to death in 2006 for leading the so-called ""Bali Nine"" trafficking ring that attempted to smuggle eight kilograms of heroin to Australia. Successive appeals have failed to have their sentences commuted, and both are on a list of inmates scheduled to die by firing squad. On Friday, their Indonesian lawyer filed what's known as a PK to apply for a second judicial review. ""It has been accepted, it will go to the courts, then it depends on the district court heads,"" Todung Mulya Lubis told media in Bali. ""There should not be an execution because the legal process should be respected as well."" The court will be asked to consider the men's rehabilitation during 10 years' of detention in Bali's Kerobokan prison. Chan now leads church prayers and is said to be a source of spiritual strength for other prisoners, while Sukumaran mentors other inmates in daily art classes. However, a spokesman for Indonesian Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo, Tony Spontana, told CNN that at a meeting held on January 9 it was decided that only one judicial review would be allowed. He said the meeting included representatives from the attorney general's office, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, the investigative department of the national police, the national anti-drug agency, and officials from the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court and ""other related institutions."" Lawyers for the men have pointed to a Constitutional Court ruling in 2013 which cleared the way for a second judicial review. However, Spontana said that ruling wasn't effective because the relevant regulations hadn't been implemented. Until they were, he said ""we have to stick to the old rule that says judicial review is only possible for one time.""' The Australians are not the only foreigners awaiting execution by an Indonesia firing squad. Of 11 presidential decrees, eight relate to drug offenses. Of those eight, seven are foreign nationals, including the two Australians, Spontana said. The others are from Ghana, France, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Brazil. No date had been decided for their executions, he said. Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte could be the second of his countrymen killed in Indonesia in a matter of weeks. On January 18, Indonesia executed Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira who was arrested at Jakarta airport in 2003 with 13 kilograms of cocaine. Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff reacted with outrage at the killing and recalled the country's ambassador from Indonesia for consultations. The Netherlands did the same after the shooting of its citizen, Ang Kiem Soei, who was convicted of running a factory that made ecstasy pills. The Philippines is reported to be seeking a judicial review in the case of its citizen, a woman who was arrested at Yogyakarta airport in April 2010 carrying 2.6 kilograms of heroin on a flight from Malaysia. The French citizen has been named as Serge Atlaoui, who was sentenced to death in 2007, according to French press. After the most recent executions -- which were the first since 2013 -- Indonesia's president Joko Widodo told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that too many Indonesian lives were being lost to drugs. ""Every day we have 50 people die because of narcotics, of drugs. In one year, it's 18,000 people who die because of narcotics. We are not going to compromise for drug dealers. No compromise. No compromise,"" he said. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed concern about the use of the death penalty for drug offenses. ""According to international human rights jurisprudence, capital punishment could only be applied to the crime of murder or intentional killing,"" OHCHR spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told reporters. She said the U.N. was particularly concerned about ""respect for due process"" after Widodo stated he would categorically reject all appeals for clemency.","Application accepted by the court for a second judicial review of two members of 'Bali Nine'

"(CNN)It's hardly surprising that the recent crash of an unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone, on the grounds of the White House has sparked debate about the future of the technology. But although this intrusion is the one that has made national headlines, it's far from the first over the past 12 months. Last year, for example, the Federal Aviation Administration fined a man for crashing a drone in Manhattan, narrowly missing pedestrians. Also in 2014, the National Park Service banned the use of drones in parks. And in Washington, the FAA reported nearly 200 drones sighted near other aircraft or restricted buildings. Such incidents generally lead anti-drone activists and some politicians to lambaste the drone industry for violating our privacy. Others use such events to highlight how terrorists and criminals could use drones to wreak havoc. But while there are elements of truth in these claims, and while the challenge of handling this increasingly widespread technology should be taken seriously by state and federal authorities, the government does in fact have it within its power to regulate this new and exciting technology with which many Americans have also fallen in love. According to current FAA rules, no commercial or government organizations (including universities and other research agencies) can fly any drone of any size outside, not even 1 inch above the ground, without special authorization, something that is difficult and time-consuming to obtain. However, in an almost ""Alice in Wonderland"" reality, hobbyists and recreational users with virtually no training or aviation knowledge are allowed to fly drones under 55 pounds in unrestricted airspace under 400 feet. In practice, this means that any recreational user can buy a drone from the Internet and fly it with no training or experience, while an aviation drone expert with thousands of hours of training is not allowed to fly that very same drone over a field to take images of ailing crops to pinpoint infestations. The FAA has been under fire from both Congress and various commercial enterprises to revamp these rules. Indeed, under the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Congress ordered the FAA to begin licensing commercial drones by 2015, and the FAA has repeatedly said it will soon produce a proposed rule for small UAVs. An early draft of these rules obtained by The Wall Street Journal reportedly will require operators to have formal pilot training and licensing in addition to flying only during the day and only in direct line of sight. But there are numerous problems with these proposed changes. For a start, there's the requirement that all drone operators must get private pilot licenses. While no doubt a boon to struggling flying clubs around the country, there is little evidence to suggest that a person with experience flying inside an aircraft has the necessary skill set to fly a drone remotely, especially where the autopilot is doing the flying and human skill cannot recover a damaged aircraft. Interestingly, the FAA's researchers conducted a study 10 years ago that showed formally trained military pilots of manned aircraft make more mistakes when controlling UAVs than do operators who learn to control drones without any hands-on flight experience. This may sound counterintuitive, but it's known as negative transfer of training, and is well-known to the human factors community -- pilots of manned aircraft learn to rely on a completely different set of visual and aural cues that simply do not exist for operators of drones. This means that video gamers and air traffic controllers will in many cases likely make better drone pilots than actual pilots since their skill sets more closely align with the task of remotely supervising an aircraft. Moreover, restricting such flights to daytime hours and only in line of sight, as has been suggested, wipes out important growth industries for drones such as delivery of medical and other supplies. These new rules, if approved, will not only further stifle the emerging U.S. drone industry, which promises to infuse money and jobs into local communities, but will also allow other countries to overtake the U.S. lead quickly. Amazon's new Prime Air, for a start, would likely have problems conducting business in this country, at a time when France has recently announced its national postal service will be conducting drone operations in the near future. And in its recent unveiling of Project Wing, another potential drone delivery service, Google X conducted its testing and flight demonstrations in Australia, which is known for its more drone-friendly policies. Ultimately, the key question is whether more streamlined and coherent FAA policies could have prevented incidents such as the drone crash on the White House lawn. And while people with nefarious (or fraternity prank) intent will likely ignore whatever laws are on the books, training for all drone users tailored specifically to unmanned systems would almost certainly mean fewer such incidents. That said, requiring operators of small drones to obtain expensive and marginally useful private pilot ratings, in excessively constrained flight conditions, will only ensure that the average drone pilot will ignore the regulations. The challenge drones pose is a very real one, and if we want to reduce the chances of public harm, the FAA and other bodies will need to step up. But they also need to be smart about it. Knee-jerk reactions will only hamper America's ability to adapt to the technology -- and it will do nothing to keep us safer.","The crash of a small drone on White House grounds made headlines recently .

"Arriving with the Iranian supreme leader's blessing to show ""heroic flexibility"" in global diplomacy, and having built up to his U.N. General Assembly appearance with weeks of conciliatory gestures, tweets and media engagement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani carried the prospect of a sudden breakthrough in the 34-year U.S.-Iran impasse in his right hand. But despite fevered global attention, no dramatic handshake with President Obama ever happened. Reportedly, the Iranian U.N. delegation told its American counterparts that the handshake was ""too complicated back home"" just now.  When it will not be too complicated back home is a good question. If recent history is any guide, things may remain complicated for some time. In 1998, then-Iranian President Mohammad Khatami came to the U.N. General Assembly after a landslide election victory and an even stronger voter mandate than Rouhani.  President Bill Clinton addressed the assembly the same day as Khatami, and media outlets speculated on the prospect of a ""chance"" meeting between presidents. Clinton and Khatami earnestly wished to meet, but the word came from Tehran forbidding the encounter.   Even then, it was ""too complicated"" back in the corridors of power in Tehran. Also in parallel, then-Secretary of State Madeline Albright and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi met within the contact group working on Afghanistan, just as Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif are set to meet Thursday within the context of the P5+1 -- countries involved in diplomacy with Iran over its nuclear program -- and possibly one-on-one. No presidential meeting ever happened at either General Assembly  gathering. Nonetheless, after the 1998 assembly, positive U.S.-Iran diplomatic engagement on Afghanistan did foster the removal of the Taliban and a successful Bonn Agreement establishing a democratically elected Afghan government. This limited but important diplomatic progress continued, despite some setbacks, until President George W. Bush ranked Iran among the ""axis of evil"" in his first State of the Union address after September 11.  Things had become pretty complicated in Washington. At the presidential level, either the U.S. side or the Iranian side can always -- and credibly -- point to domestic political factors making any bold conciliatory gesture too complicated.  Deeply rooted policy instruments, skepticism, alliance structures and political careers have grown up around three decades of estrangement in both capitals. Given these longstanding issues, it is not surprising that the adversarial framework still guides virtually all interaction and that breakthroughs -- even as simple as those afforded by a handshake -- are fraught with peril.  Indeed, even the Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was obliged to qualify his recent call for ""heroic flexibility"" after hardliners objected. But while the U.S.-Iran relationship might continue within this adversarial framework for the time being, with complex domestic considerations affecting every step, there is still some reason for measured optimism. Coming out of their General Assembly appearances, both presidents seemed to agree on four key points: . First, that the nuclear issue is a primary obstacle to progress on other areas of dispute, and resolving this issue must be a top priority. Second, that the diplomatic arena, rather than the superheated spotlight of head of state politics, may hold the key to real progress. Third, that discussions aimed at resolving the nuclear dispute must take place within an atmosphere of ""mutual respect."" Fourth, that any reduction of economic sanctions will require concrete, verifiable progress on the nuclear issue. No less important than this consensus on foreign policy, both understand that antagonizing important domestic constituencies in each others' capitals only makes diplomatic progress harder.  President Rohani's acknowledging the Holocaust during his interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, and thereby distancing himself from his bellicose predecessor, was a welcome case in point. To advance these priorities, both the United States and Iran have entrusted progress on the nuclear issue to their diplomats.  On the U.S. side, Obama announced during his U.N. speech that Kerry would assume the lead on the nuclear issue.  Within Iran's system, Iran's Foreign Ministry took over the nuclear file from the Supreme National Security Council after the appointment of Zarif. Zarif's credentials and track record offer the promise of a credible and professional partner, as does the clear mandate of Iran's recent elections that brought Rouhani to power with the promise of ending Iran's international isolation. So the spotlight shifts to diplomacy, and both sides agree that tangible, timely results are a must.  Kerry now must be empowered to employ all the tools in America's diplomatic arsenal to achieve progress in tandem with U.S. allies on the Iran nuclear issue. The best intelligence and analysis support, upgraded Persian-language media outreach and information programming, and expanded academic and cultural exchanges with the Iranian people will bolster State's efforts greatly.  Of course, U.S. allies as well as Congress -- justifiably skeptical after so many years -- must be kept informed of progress. It will take hard work and time, but for the first time in decades, empowered bilateral diplomacy has a chance.  Perhaps at some point along the long road ahead, ideally after a peaceful resolution to the nuclear dispute opens the way to broader bilateral dialogue, we may even witness the long-awaited presidential handshake.","Ramin Asgard says an Obama-Rouhani handshake turned out to be ""too complicated""

"(CNN) -- The Al-Shabaab assault on a mall in Nairobi, Kenya, is alarming for its audacity, its scale and the sophisticated planning that went into it. Both the choice of target and method of attack exactly fit the new al Qaeda playbook. Few counterterrorism experts are surprised that the Somali group launched another attack in the Kenyan capital. It has threatened to take revenge ever since Kenyan forces entered Al-Shabaab's heartland in southern Somalia. Small-scale attacks, frequently with hand grenades, have already brought bloodshed to Nairobi's streets. Back in September of last year, Kenyan authorities said they had disrupted a major plot to attack public spaces in Nairobi in its final stages of planning. Authorities also broke up a plot by the group against Western tourists in the city in late 2007. But the scope of the assault on the Westgate Mall -- and especially its eerie similarities to the attack in Mumbai, India, in 2008 -- show that Al-Shabaab has taken its ability to strike outside Somalia to a new level. Only once before has the group caused such carnage in East Africa, when bombers attacked bars and restaurants in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, on the night of the World Cup Final in 2010. More than 60 people were killed. Al-Shabaab said the attacks were in retaliation for Uganda's leading role in the African Union force supporting Somalia's weak government in Mogadishu. But the attack on the Westgate Mall is very different, involving perhaps 10 or more heavily armed assailants, using multiple entrance points to lay siege to a high-profile venue in an upscale neighborhood. The assault then evolved into a hostage-taking to garner maximum publicity. Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness . Al-Shabaab says the attack took months of planning and training, and as it unfolded the group kept up a running commentary on its Twitter feed. ""The Mujahideen entered #Westgate Mall today at around noon and are still inside the mall, fighting the #Kenyan Kuffar (infidels) inside their own turf,"" it said. Al Qaeda Template . The operation ticks the boxes that al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri listed in a message published just over a week ago. 1. Ensure the target is Western. The Westgate Mall has several Israeli establishments and is popular with expatriates. Those killed include three British citizens, two French nationals and two Canadians, their governments said. In his September 13 message, al-Zawahiri warned against attacks on non-Western states unless the regime was part of ""the American forces."" Kenya, with its long tradition of pro-Western governments and close relationships with Western militaries, fits that bill. 2. Take hostages where possible. Al-Zawahiri recommended taking ""the citizens of the countries that are participating in the invasion of Muslim countries as hostages so that our prisoners may be freed in exchange."" 3. Try to avoid Muslim casualties. Al-Shabaab claimed on its Twitter feed that the gunmen escorted Muslims out of the mall, before turning on the ""disbelievers"" inside. Witnesses said the gunmen at the Westgate tried to identify Muslims by asking shoppers the name of Mohammed's mother. They shot those who didn't know. Nairobi is vulnerable to Al-Shabaab attacks not least because of the large Somali community, many of them refugees from the country's long-running clan warfare, that lives in the Eastleigh district. Known as ""little Mogadishu,"" Eastleigh is now home to an estimated 250,000 Somalis. And Al-Shabaab is well established there, raising money, finding recruits and setting up safe houses. Al-Shabaab also has an ally in the militant Kenyan group al Hijra, formerly the Muslim Youth Center, which has a strong presence in Eastleigh and in the coastal city of Mombasa. Investigators will be examining whether al Hijra played a role in the attack on the Westgate mall. Kenyan al Hijra militants are suspected to have been responsible for several of the small-scale terrorist attacks that have hit the country. Bergen: How Al-Shabaab picks its targets . This is a worrying trend, analysts say. While Al-Shabaab's Somali fighters are not used to operating abroad, non-Somali East Africans have been training with the group in southern Somalia. Al Hijra is the most potent outgrowth of that training. Founded in an Eastleigh mosque in 2008, al Hijra took advantage of growing radicalization among a minority of Kenya's 4.3 million Muslims to build a significant presence in Nairobi and Mombasa. Investigators established the group had close links to the attacks in Kampala in July 2010. According to the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia, most of the operatives who conspired in the attack were Kenyan and close to al Hijra leaders. A crackdown against al Hijra by Kenyan authorities, helped by the United States, has weakened the group. According to a 2013 United Nations report, ""Al Hijra members were plagued by unexplained killings, disappearances, continuous 'catch and release' arrest raids and operational disruptions."" But al Hijra is far from defeated. According to the U.N. report, it has established links with Al-Shabaab affiliates elsewhere in East Africa and is enlisting the services of fighters returning from Somalia ""to conduct new and more complex operations."" Its leadership has become closer to al Qaeda through figures such as Abubakar Shariff Ahmed, known as ""Makaburi,"" who is said to favor large-scale attacks in Kenya in support of Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab has other valuable alliances in the region, including the government of Eritrea, which sees it as a useful ally against its arch-enemy Ethiopia. A United Nations Monitoring Group reported in 2011 that financial records and shipping movements indicated Eritrea's support for Al-Shabaab went far beyond the humanitarian. In a 400-page report, it concluded that Eritrea's relationship with Al-Shabaab seemed designed to ""legitimize and embolden the group rather than to curb its extremist orientation or encourage its participation in a political process."" Al-Shabaab has also established a relationship with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, from which it obtains weapons and training, according to counterterrorism officials and former members of both AQAP and Al-Shabaab. One former jihadist tells CNN the relationship began in 2008 when he linked up a senior figure in Al-Shabaab, Ahmed Warsame, with the Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. In September 2011, the U.S. Africa Command warned that Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram in NIgeria and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb were trying to synchronize their efforts to launch attacks on U.S and Western interests. Somali jihadists recruit in U.S., Canada and Europe . Kenyan incursion . The Kenyan capital became much more vulnerable to retaliation when Kenyan troops and tanks, supported by airstrikes, moved into Somalia in October 2011 in response to growing cross-border violence. Al-Shabaab immediately warned that the incursion would have ""cataclysmic consequences."" What was meant to be a limited engagement dragged on. It took a year for Kenyan forces to capture the port of Kismayo, but in doing so they dramatically raised the stakes for Al-Shabaab. According to the U.N., Al-Shabaab used to collect an estimated $35 million to $50 million annually in custom tolls and taxes on businesses in Kismayo and two secondary ports higher up the coast -- about half its entire estimated annual income. Its expulsion from Kismayo changed the dynamics for Al-Shabaab. Previously the group held off plotting large-scale attacks in Kenya because of Kenya's importance for recruitment, logistics and fund-raising. Al-Shabaab commanders realized a crackdown by law enforcement on Somali interests in Kenya would be devastating to the Somali business community, creating a backlash against it in Somalia. But after they lost control of Kismayo, the gloves came off. In March, Al-Shabaab warned Kenyans they would not ""sleep safely"" in Nairobi as long as their soldiers were in Somalia. And in the midst of the siege, the group tweeted: ""For long we have waged war against the Kenyans in our land, now it's time to shift the battleground and take the war to their land."" ""The attack at #WestgateMall is just a very tiny fraction of what Muslims in Somalia experience at the hands of Kenyan invaders,"" another tweet said. It's notable that Al-Shabaab was able to plan and train for such a sophisticated attack despite losing much territory in southern Somalia and around the capital, Mogadishu. As it has lost ground, the group has resorted to suicide bombings. Earlier this month it carried out a bomb attack against a restaurant popular with Westerners in Mogadishu, killing more than a dozen people. A U.N. report issued in July noted that Al-Shabaab ""has shifted its strategic posture to asymmetrical warfare in both urban centres and the countryside"" but added that it ""continues to control most of southern and central Somalia."" The report estimated the military strength of Al-Shabaab at about 5,000 fighters, with a functioning chain of command, and said it had ""preserved the core of its fighting force and resources."" After years of infighting and feuds, the Nairobi attack may also confirm the ascendancy of Al-Shabaab's most militant faction and its leader Mukhtar Abu al Zubayr (aka Ahmed Abdi Godane). Zubayr attended a madrassa in Pakistan as a young man and merged the group with al Qaeda in February 2012. He sees Al-Shabaab as part of al Qaeda's global jihad. Dissenters have defected or been killed. Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys of Al-Shabaab's old guard surrendered to Somali authorities. And earlier this month Zubayr reportedly ordered the killing of two Western militants who were critical of his leadership style and had aligned themselves with Aweys -- Omar Hammami and Osama al Brittani. Hammami was an American from Alabama who had become a prominent mouthpiece for Al-Shabaab before publicly criticizing Zubayr last year. Zubayr's increasingly tight grip on Al-Shabaab -- thanks to his ruthless use of the group's intelligence wing in hunting down opponents -- appears to have forestalled the collapse of Al-Shabaab, and may have made it more dangerous. Zubayr has threatened a direct attack on the United States, and last year the U.S. offered a $7 million reward for information locating him. It would be very surprising if the attack in Nairobi did not receive his blessing, and it may be a sign of things to come as Al-Shabaab takes its war to other parts of East Africa. Of more immediate concern to Kenyan authorities, in a country where political violence can explode quickly, is a likely backlash against Somali and Kenyan Muslims, which could create a new cycle of radicalization and unrest.","Al-Shabaab has threatened revenge on Kenya ever since Kenyan forces entered Somalia .

"NATO will suspend ""all practical civilian and military cooperation"" with Russia because of its annexation of Crimea, saying it has seen no sign that Moscow was withdrawing troops from the Ukrainian border. Foreign ministers from the 28 members of the Western military alliance met in Brussels on Tuesday for the first time since Russia grabbed the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine last month, triggering the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War. They were discussing ways to boost NATO's military presence in formerly communist central and Eastern Europe to reassure allies worried by Russia's moves. After the session, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Russia has challenged truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self-evident: that European borders in the 21st century would not be redrawn by force. ""It is important for everybody in the world to understand that the NATO alliance takes seriously this attempt to change borders by use of force,"" he said. ""So that is the wake-up call."" Russia's aggression ""is the gravest threat to European security in a generation and it challenges our vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace,"" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters. In a joint statement announcing the suspension of cooperation, the ministers said political dialogue in the NATO-Russia Council could continue, ""as necessary, at the ambassadorial level and above, to allow us to exchange views, first and foremost on this crisis."" They said they would review NATO's relations with Russia at their next meeting in June. NATO and Russia have cooperated on an anti-narcotics operation in Afghanistan, counterpiracy and various counterterrorism measures. Rasmussen said cooperation on the anti-narcotics operations would continue. A NATO official told CNN the ministers had decided the alliance would develop, as a matter of urgency, ""a series of additional measures to reinforce NATO's collective defenses."" These would include possible deployments and reinforcements of alliance military assets in Eastern European member states, a possible review of training and exercise plans in the near term, a possible increase of the readiness level of the NATO Response Force, and a possible review and update of NATO defense and military plans, the official said. Russian troops on border . Earlier, Rasmussen said he saw no sign that Russia is pulling its forces back from the border with Ukraine. ""Unfortunately, I cannot confirm that Russia is withdrawing its troops,"" Rasmussen said at the opening of the two-day meeting. ""This is not what we're seeing. And this massive military buildup can in no way contribute to a de-escalation of the situation."" Concerns are high that Russia, which U.S. officials last week said had about 40,000 troops near the frontier, might seek to enter eastern Ukraine, after it annexed Ukraine's Crimea region last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday that he'd ordered a withdrawal of some Russian troops from his country's border area with Ukraine, Merkel's office said. The news prompted U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki to say Monday that if the reports were accurate, ""it would be a welcome preliminary step."" On Tuesday, Merkel told reporters: ""I can only take what the Russian President has told me. I will, of course, try to find out whether this is perceptible or not perceptible."" According to Russian state media Monday, one Russian infantry battalion was being moved from the border area to its base deeper in Russia. A battalion would typically number several hundred troops. But Rasmussen appeared to quash hopes that the situation might be easing with his remarks Tuesday. His assessment was echoed in Brussels by UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, who said: ""We have had some statements or rumors from Russia about pulling back forces from the eastern border of Ukraine. ""But we haven't seen the evidence of that yet. Of course, we continue to call for that and continue to use every possible diplomatic lead to seek a de-escalation of this crisis."" Kerry, among those in Brussels for the NATO meeting, also called for a Russian withdrawal in lengthy weekend talks in Paris with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. What do we know about Russia's troop buildup on Ukraine's border? Also Tuesday, the U.S. House gave final congressional approval to legislation that would impose sanctions on Russia for its takeover of Crimea and provide $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine. The bill now goes to President Barack Obama for his signature. In a statement, the White House said the President welcomed the move. ""This legislation will allow us to provide crucial support to Ukraine through loan guarantees that will facilitate access to needed financing to Ukraine as it takes essential steps to restore economic stability and return to growth and prosperity,"" it read. NATO and Ukraine cooperation . The foreign ministers also met with Ukrainian acting Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia in the latest demonstration of Western support. Moscow does not recognize Ukraine's new government, saying President Viktor Yanukovych was removed in an unconstitutional coup. In a joint statement, they called on Moscow ""to reverse the illegal and illegitimate 'annexation' of Crimea; to refrain from any further interference and aggressive actions in Ukraine ... and to abide by international law."" At the same time, NATO and Ukraine announced they would intensify cooperation and promote defense reforms in Ukraine through training and other programs. Rasmussen told reporters the ministers agreed to help Ukraine make its military ""more professional and more effective"" and provide advice on how it can defend its infrastructure. ""A possibility is also deployment of mobile training teams as and when appropriate,"" he said. Pressed on how NATO was prepared to help Ukraine improve its military,  Rasmussen cited enhanced military exercises as an example. As the talks got under way, Russia's Foreign Ministry had warned Ukraine against seeking integration into the defense alliance. Discussion of the issue while Yanukovych was in power ""led to freezing of Russian-Ukrainian political communications, to headaches in the relationship between NATO and Russia and, what is the most dangerous, to the deepening of the split of Ukrainian society, the majority of which doesn't support the idea of Ukraine entering NATO,"" a Foreign Ministry statement said. It added that Kiev must understand that the prospects for future cooperation between Ukraine and Russia, including on economic matters, ""will largely depend on the actions Ukraine takes in its foreign policy."" Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula last month amid the political upheaval that followed the ouster of the pro-Moscow Yanukovych. Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday granted permission for foreign military units, including some from NATO countries, to conduct military exercises in Ukraine in 2014. Such military exercises by foreign troops, including naval drills in the Black Sea, are an annual event but take on additional significance this year in light of Russia's military takeover of Crimea. Gazprom hikes natural gas price . In a move that will heighten pressure on the interim government in Kiev, Russian energy giant Gazprom announced a sharp increase in the price it charges Ukraine for natural gas. Starting Tuesday, Ukraine will be charged $385.50 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas, up from the previous rate of $268.50, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Gazprom Chief Executive Alexei Miller as saying. The move ends a discount that was agreed to before Yanukovych was ousted in February after months of street protests. The gas price hike will only increase the pressure on Ukraine's interim government as it seeks to stave off economic collapse. Ukraine, which is heavily reliant on Russia for energy, is also $1.7 billion in arrears in its payments for gas already supplied, Miller said, according to RIA Novosti. The International Monetary Fund last week agreed to lend Ukraine up to $18 billion over the next two years in return for a package of reforms, including to its energy market. Kiev has been running dangerously low on cash to pay for imports and service its debts since the ouster of Yanukovych, which killed off a $15 billion financial lifeline from Russia. Is Crimea gone?

"Even as Capitol Hill remained consumed by the government shutdown, House Democrats hoping to jump start the stalled debate over immigration reform put a new proposal on the table Wednesday. ""The American people have spoken,"" said Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Florida. ""They want Congress to take on this issue."" Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-California, said he has no doubt there are enough House votes to pass a bill that ""fixes our broken immigration system, including provide a path to legal residency and ultimately to citizenship to millions of people who work hard everyday in this country."" Sound familiar? It should. In many ways, the Democrats say the bill they're introducing is similar to the immigration reform measure passed by the Senate in June. But there's at least one key difference: this version doesn't include the plan to build more border fencing and step up security with thousands more border patrol agents. ""We are not introducing the perfect bill. But we are introducing a comprehensive reform bill that provides that space for compromise that takes the very hard and tough work that was done in the Senate and takes the very detailed and specific work that was done in the House and so, we put them both together,"" Garcia said. ""And we have taken out the very controversial Corker-Hoeven (border security amendment), which I think everyone understood has opposition not only in elements in the Democratic Party but very strong opposition of members of the House."" The proposed House bill doesn't have any Republican backers who've signed on yet. Still, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Democratic minority leader, described the bill as ""100% bipartisan"" because it combines measures that have gotten support on both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate. Supporters of immigration reform applauded the Democrats' announcement Wednesday. But it's uncertain whether the measure will ever be up for debate on the House floor, since Republican House Speaker John Boehner is the one who would need to schedule a vote on the matter -- something he hasn't done yet.","Proposed House bill doesn't include border security measures passed by the Senate .

"Pennville, Georgia (CNN)A human face appeared in white paint on the end of his finger. It sounds crazy, but the way late folk artist Howard Finster told the story, the mysterious face said, ""Paint sacred art; paint sacred art."" The vision came to the retired Baptist preacher in 1976 while he was working on a bicycle in his Pennville, Georgia, repair shop. One of a lifelong string of visions, it was just the sign he needed to devote the rest of his days to spreading God's message through art. Finster was 59. ""When most people are winding down, he was winding up,"" said Jordan Poole, executive director of Paradise Garden, a 4-acre property teeming with Finster's creations, about 90 miles northwest of Atlanta. And more than a dozen years after his death, interest in Finster seems to be winding up again, too. He's one of the headliners in a new exhibit in Baltimore at the American Visionary Art Museum, which bills him as ""America's most prolific self-tutored and 'on fire' artist."" He's also the star of the documentary ""Paradise Garden: Howard Finster's Legacy,"" released this year by Art West Film. But perhaps most significant, there's a revival under way in the garden where he worked frenetically, day and night, to grow towering heaps of bicycle parts and a meditation chapel draped in whimsical bric-a-brac along with hand-painted Bible verses, a covered ""Rolling Chair"" gallery, the glimmering World's Folk Art Church and a mosaic wonderland embedded with plastic toys, fragments of mirror, shards of colored glass, Madonnas and more. Paradise Garden is located about 90 miles northwest of Atlanta in unincorporated Pennville, Georgia. The garden is open Tuesday-Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults, $3 for seniors and $2 for children. The documentary ""Paradise Garden: Howard Finster's Legacy"" is showing November 18 at 7:30 p.m. at the Goat Farm Arts Center in Atlanta. Finster was a musician, a showman and an avid artistic collaborator. In the 1980s, he designed album covers for R.E.M. and the Talking Heads, and charmed audiences with his tales, songs and banjo-playing on Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show."" R.E.M.'s ""Radio Free Europe"" music video was filmed in the garden. Yet his overarching purpose was clear, and he defined it simply: ""God called me here. I'm interested in every human being in this world,"" he said during a 1987 event at the garden. ""I didn't come here to put nothin' on nobody, push nothin' on nobody. I didn't come here to take nothin' away from nobody. I didn't come here to start some new kind of religion. ""I come here for one thing, and that is, I have visions of other worlds. I have visions that's inimaginable. I have visions that I can't even tell people. And I try, the best I can, to draw my visions,"" he said. He didn't sleep much. Finster produced 46,991 numbered works before he died in 2001 at 84. And that figure doesn't include most of what's on view in the garden. The jumbled property in northern Georgia was in desperate need of attention after Chattooga County purchased the garden in late 2011 and handed management to the Paradise Garden Foundation in 2012. Over the past few years, the foundation has literally been digging the art out. The new documentary film, directed by Ava Leigh Stewart, chronicles the process from the beginning. The swampy ground where the Finster family made their home in the early 1960s had started to reclaim some of the structures that sprouted up in the garden over the years. With the help of more than $700,000 in grant money, the foundation has raised and stabilized many of the garden's key attractions. The restoration has been a delicate balance, though. ""We went to great lengths to have it slightly decayed-looking. We don't want it to be pristine,"" Poole said. Finster and his wife, Pauline, moved down the road to Summerville in the early '90s after Pauline got fed up with fans turning up at all hours for an audience with her husband. Although Finster still spent a lot of time at the garden, it didn't get as much attention after the couple moved, Poole said, and deteriorated after Finster's death in 2001. Now, there's a new visitor center with exhibition space and an audiovisual experience that introduces guests to the ""man of visions,"" plus new plumbing and electricity for that unglorifed but essential museum amenity: restrooms. The site is now welcoming about 7,000 visitors a year, Poole said. It's not a huge number but definitely a huge spike. Visitation jumped by more than 400% between August 2012 and August 2014. The restoration is good for the garden, but it's also good for the unincorporated community of Pennville and neighboring Summerville. ""It's not just to save the place for its own sake but ... to help a community and be a part of that community and to reawaken a community that was really and truly almost dead just a couple years ago,"" said Poole, who grew up in Summerville. New businesses and art galleries have opened. There's more activism around the arts, and local business are embracing cultural tourism, Poole said. There's still a lot of work to be done. The foundation aims to raise $900,000 for the next phase of the garden's revival. One key goal of the next phase's capital campaign is to rehabilitate the rotting interior of the World's Folk Art Church, a church that Finster bought with a grant in 1982 and retopped to look like a towering wedding cake. Despite the work ahead, the transformation is already apparent to repeat visitors. Theresa Dean, 56, an art teacher from Sandy Springs, Georgia, has been to the garden several times since her first visit in 2007. She visited again at the end of October with a group of middle school students. There's been a ""huge change"" since her last visit about two years ago, she said. ""It's beautiful,"" Dean said. ""I can tell they're still working, but it just seems like it's loved, well-loved.""","Paradise Garden showcases the work of late folk artist Howard Finster .

"With the government shut down over a bitter partisan battle over the new health care law, the approval rating for Congress is plummeting to historic lows. And a CNN/ORC International poll released on Monday indicates that it's not just Congress and its top leaders making history for all the wrong reasons. It's also the tea party and the Democratic and Republican parties. According to the survey, just 10% of Americans say they approve of the job Congress is doing, an all-time low in a CNN poll. And 87% say they disapprove of the job federal lawmakers are doing, higher than it's ever been in CNN polling. The 10% approval rating in the new CNN survey, which was conducted Friday through Sunday, is down 10 percentage points from CNN's previous survey at the beginning of the month. The 87% disapproval rating is a jump of nine points from the first week in September. While Americans' perception of the job Congress is doing has taken a hit, President Barack Obama's approval rating -- well under 50% -- has remained steady since earlier in the month. Forty-four percent of those questioned say they approve of the job Obama's doing as president, with 53% giving him a thumbs down. Those numbers are basically unchanged from the 45%-52% approval/disapproval rating in CNN's previous survey. ""President Obama's strong suit remains his personal qualities, with a 51% majority still saying that he has the personality and leadership qualities a president should have, although that number is down six points from our last survey,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""But only 42% say that he agrees with them on issues that matter most, while 54% say they disagree with him on issues."" While the Democratic Party remains more popular with the public than the GOP, the CNN survey indicates that its favorable rating has taken a bigger hit since the spring. Forty-three percent of those questioned say they have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, with 52% saying they see the Democrats in an unfavorable light. Those numbers are the reverse of where they stood in CNN polling in May when more respondents had a favorable view of the party than an unfavorable one. While the Democrats' favorable rating dropped nine points, the GOP rating only edged down three points, from 35% in May to 32% now. More than six in 10 say they have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party. The Democratic and Republican unfavorable ratings are also all-time highs in CNN polling. The unfavorable numbers for the tea party movement are also at an all-time high in CNN surveys. Thirty-one percent say they see the tea party in a favorable light, while 54% hold an unfavorable view of the of the movement now in its fifth year. The drive to overthrow the health care law, which was passed in 2010 when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, is being fueled by GOP lawmakers voted into office the past two elections with the strong support of tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives. GOP congressman: It's time to move on . Meet the man behind the government shutdown . CNN Fact Check: Obamacare . The top leaders in the House and Senate are also taking a hit in the court of public opinion. House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the two party leaders at the center of the budget negotiations that led to a shutdown, ""have become more unpopular since earlier this year, and both are facing the highest unfavorable ratings they have ever received in CNN polling,"" Holland said. Only one in three have a favorable view of Boehner, with 48% holding a negative view of the top Republican in the House. That's an 11-point change since May, when 37% had an unfavorable view of Boehner.

"(CNN)  -- Rory McIlroy has defended his preparation for this week's British Open as he bids to win back-to-back majors without playing any competitive golf since his U.S. Open triumph at Congressional. The 22-year-old from Northern Ireland has drawn comparisons with Tiger Woods for the manner of his eight-shot triumph, but has not lifted a club in anger in the intervening three weeks. It has led his former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie to question the wisdom of the lack of match practice, but McIlroy was adamant Tuesday that his approach worked for him. ""I mean, I've prepared the exact same way that I've prepared for the last few major championships, and I feel it's a process that works for me, "" he told of the official British Open website. ""Coming to the course the week before, getting a couple of practise rounds in, and then not really getting to the course until Tuesday afternoon. ""That works for me. I used to do it to sort of keep under the radar. I'm not sure I'll be able to do that anymore. But it works for me. Caddying for the world number one . ""It might not work for other people, but I feel as if it's the best way for me to approach a tournament. It seems to have worked the last few times, so I just need to keep doing that."" McIlroy has also had to cope with being catapulted into celebrity ranks, with a high-profile appearance at the Wimbledon tennis championships plus a host of other media commitments. He admitted the reaction to his first major success had been something of a surprise. ""I didn't realize how much of a fuss it would create or how much of a buzz,"" said McIlroy. ""I've already sort of noticed over the past three weeks it has been a bit of a life-changing experience, and it's just something I'm going to have to deal with."" McIlroy tees off at Royal St George's in the 140th edition of golf's oldest major at 9.09 local time with Ernie Els of South African and fellow young gun Rickie Fowler of the United States. He will be looking to match the spectacular 63 at last year's British Open at St Andrews which gave him the first round lead, but not the second round 80 which ended his chances of victory. Meanwhile, world number one Luke Donald bids for back-to-back victories of his own after claiming the Scottish Open at Castle Stewart at the weekend. Donald, who took over the mantle from fellow Englishman Lee Westwood, admitted he was in the form of his life. ""This is probably the best I have ever played,"" he said as he reflected on a stellar 2011 which has seen him claim three victories and a clutch of top-10 finishes. It was kickstarted by his victory at the WGC World Match Play tournament in Arizona. ""As soon as you get that one win, it kind of opened up the door, gave me a lot of confidence, and I've been playing very well since then,"" he added.","Rory McIlroy bidding to win second straight major at British Open .

"(CNN)While it's a form of transport few of us see, shipping packs a punch as a polluter. According to a recent study, shipping accounts for around 3% of global CO2 emissions. Not surprising when you consider that the engines of the world's estimated 90,000 cargo ships are in use 24 hours a day while traveling. Futuristic concepts for container ships powered by alternative energy range from windmill-powered propellers to banks of vertical metal sails. Even though most are still on the drawing board, one concept is starting to be viewed seriously by the shipping industry. Airfoil design . Called the ""Vindskip,"" the Norwegian design uses the high sides of its container ships as sails, turning the whole vessel into a wind-assisted airfoil. Designed by Lade AS, the Oslo-based company says the hybrid merchant ship -- which would still have a liquefied natural gas-powered engine -- could achieve fuel savings of 60% and reduce emissions by 80%. It's the brainchild of Terje Lade, who used his skills as a speed sailor to develop his aerodynamic design. He says the futuristic container ship works more like an airplane than a conventional sailing ship. He said: ""In the era of Christopher Columbus, for example, he would have used what became known as trade winds but his ship was quite different from the VindSkip because he would have been sailing with the wind -- he couldn't sail into the wind. ""VindSkip can almost sail into the wind; in this way it's more like an airplane. ""It uses apparent wind, or the sail wind, to generate pull in much the same way that an airplane will take off when it reaches a certain speed."" The ship would be able to point as high as 18 degrees into the wind, the vacuum created on the lee side of the vessel (the side sheltered from the wind) enough to propel the ship forward. Computers critical . Critical to the design is computer software being developed by Germany's Fraunhofer Center for Maritime Logistics and Services, which calculates the optimal sailing route based on the weather and prevailing winds. ""With this software, you input when you want to leave and when you want to arrive, the weather forecast is loaded into the program and then it calculates the best route,"" Lade said. ""This would be dynamically updated every day. At each waypoint it would check with the time arrival and tell the crew whether to speed up using the engines or slow down; it makes it very easy for the crew."" The algorithms in the software also calculate the best angle to the wind to gain the maximum performance from the design. ""With our weather routing module the best route can be calculated in order to consume as little fuel as possible. As a result costs are reduced. After all, bunker (ship fuel oil) expenses account for the largest part of the total costs in the shipping industry,"" said Laura Walther, researcher at CML in Hamburg. Sulfur -- the game changer . Changes to regulations in the sulfur content of marine heavy fuels are set to make the price of bunker fuel -- typically among the heaviest and dirtiest of fuels in the distillation process -- more expensive. Shippers traditionally favored polluting residual bunker fuels because they were cheap, with large ships having the space to transport the pre-heaters necessary to make the fuel volatile. But all that is about to change. Current international regulations cap sulfur content at 3.5% but this is expected to drop to 0.5% by 2020. ""This makes things quite dramatic,"" said Lade. ""There are not many good solutions to this. At the moment they can wash the exhaust with scrubbers but on big ships this is very complex and very expensive. ""This is where the 'Vindskip' comes in -- due to the low fuel consumption it can run on LNG which means there is no sulfur at all."" One of Norway's biggest shipowners, Wilhelmsen, has already entered the project on a technical basis and, while Lade is quietly confident the world's first Vindskip will slip into the water by 2019, he says the global shipping industry had been slow to respond to his design. ""(But) the big driving force in the Vindskip project will be these new regulations on sulfur levels,"" Lade said. ""The big problem with sulfur is that it acidifies the sea and this means that shrimps and crabs can't form their shells,"" said Lade, adding that acidification was impacting the entire marine ecosystem.  ""It's very bad. Something has to be done -- it can't go on this way."" The Danish shipping line Maersk told CNN that it was pursuing innovations in energy efficiency as a solution in the ""here and now."" ""In general, we do not believe that wind-assisted designs will play any significant role within the container shipping industry in the foreseeable future,"" said Maersk head of sustainability Signe Bruun Jensen. ""The technology remains unproven at both commercial and operational scale."" She said that Maersk was developing its Triple-E vessels which used ultra-long stroke engines, efficient vessel shape and advanced waste heat recovery systems to improve CO2 efficiency by 50% per container. ""If you look at the technology already on-board our vessels today, it's remarkable just how far we've come,"" she said.","A Norwegian design would use the high sides of a cargo ship as sails .

"(CNN)""Why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?"" If you have no idea what I'm talking about then chances are you don't know who Annalise Keating is. And if you don't know who she is, then it's likely you haven't tuned in to ABC to visit Shondaland. Those nine words epitomized the drama behind ABC's legal show, ""How To Get Away With Murder,"" which has shattered viewership numbers, delivered a SAG award to actress Viola Davis for her portrayal of Keating and shined the crown that comfortably rests on the head of one of the most influential women in culture today -- Shonda Rhimes. ""There is an unrivaled commitment to her shows,"" Marla Provencio, ABC's chief marketing officer, said about Rhimes. ""Thursday night has become a destination, with a sense of urgency to watch these shows live so the conversation can flow along with the wine. There are screening parties that revolve around them. Wine and popcorn have become the staple of the night."" In other words, Shondaland -- the name given to Rhimes' collection of TV dramas: ""Murder,"" ""Scandal"" and the matriarch, ""Grey's Anatomy."" When ABC packaged the three shows together last fall, it earned its best Thursday night ratings in five years. This week the network announced it had ordered a new Shondaland series, a crime thriller, for next year. But attempts to explain the full breadth of Rhimes' influence through the prism of Nielsen ratings would be like ditching GPS to use half a map for directions. Her shows not only feature strong fascinating characters, they are also played by strong fascinating people. Usually, television producers of popular shows are reluctant to let their main actors take visible bold stances on controversial social issues for fear of alienating eyeballs. Rhimes appears to welcome it. Kerry Washington, who's in ""Scandal,"" has not shied away from topics such as the role of affirmative action. In Davis' acceptance speech at the SAG awards she spoke about the importance of diversity, thanking Rhimes and others for thinking a ""mysterious woman could be a 49-year-old, dark-skinned, African-American woman who looks like me."" And ""Grey's Anatomy"" actor Jesse Williams not only spoke out against racism and police brutality during the Ferguson conflict, he traveled to the St. Louis suburb to participate in the marches. ""I think that she's drawn to and writes about independent-minded, head strong male and female characters and so art sometimes imitates life,"" Williams said. ""What's astonishing is that our show 'Grey's Anatomy,' started off miles ahead all other TV shows because of its diversity and representation of people from all walks of life. There wasn't any chest pounding about it, it just was. We're people, that's it. But we're strong people, like her. She's not trying to make a political gesture, she is one. She's like 'I'm dope with or without your racism; I'm dope with or without your sexism.' It's not a strategy. It's not seeing any reason to compromise and then demonstrating there is no need to do so."" And so when Rhimes stands in front of a room to receive a diversity award and calls out the industry for its lack of diversity -- as she did at last year's Director's Guild of America awards -- you know it's not narcissistic grandstanding. It's advocating for ideas and principals bigger than herself. When she stands in front of a room to accept an award for breaking the glass ceiling, and takes the occasion to give credit to all of the women in Hollywood who came before her, you know the appreciation is coming from someone who recognizes none of us get to where we are on our own. ""Different voices make for different visions,"" she said at the DGA awards. ""Different visions make for something original. Original is what the public is starving for."" Which is why it feels as if everything Rhimes places on a network's platter gets gobbled up by the Shondaland community every Thursday night. It's not that she is the only producer helming shows with snappy dialogue, office politics and sex. It's that there's an authentic, big tent feel to the debauchery that is unfolding on screen. And an authentic, big tent feel away from it. When one of Rhimes' Twitter followers complained about the ""gay scenes"" in her shows, she responded: ""There are no GAY scenes. There are scenes with people in them."" I don't know if Meredith and Derek will stay together or if Olivia and Fitz will ever be together. I just know that if you have no idea who any of those people are, you are probably doing Thursday wrong.","This week ABC announced it had ordered a new Shondaland series, a crime thriller, for next year .

"He spent more than 21 straight hours railing against any government funding for Obamacare. Then Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas joined the other 99 senators from both parties in voting Wednesday to move ahead on a spending plan expected to do just that. The rare 100-0 vote on a procedural step means the spending measure that would avoid a partial government shutdown next week now can be amended by Senate Democrats to restore funding for President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms, which had been eliminated last week by House Republicans. Cruz led a group of tea party conservatives in trying to block Senate consideration of the spending legislation because Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid made clear his caucus would remove the provision that defunded Obamacare. However, Cruz came under strong criticism from fellow Republicans for that strategy, which called for GOP senators to filibuster the House measure that -- in its original form -- would defund programs under the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year. Fed up over Beltway shutdown battle . The confusion of Cruz's strategy was apparent Wednesday when he voted with Democrats for the Senate to take up the measure less than two hours after his marathon speech against it that began Tuesday afternoon and continued overnight and through the morning. An aide to Cruz told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash that the senator always intended to allow formal consideration of the House measure, adding that Cruz would vote against it once Senate Democrats restored the Obamacare funding. However, nothing in Cruz's words or actions preceding the vote indicated that was his intention. Instead, he had urged his colleagues to unite against the spending plan, saying voting for it was tantamount to supporting Obamacare. ""Any senator who votes (to move forward with debate on the House measure) is voting to give Harry Reid the authority to fund Obamacare,"" Cruz told Bash on Monday. After Wednesday's vote, Cruz told reporters that his long night sought to unite Republicans to block any funding for Obamacare. ""Coming into this debate we clearly were not united,"" he said. ""There were significant divisions in the conference. I hope those divisions dissolve; that we come together in party unity"" with all 46 Republicans preventing a final vote on the spending plan once Democrats amend it to fund Obamacare. Cruz and other tea party conservatives wanted to prevent the Senate from taking up the spending measure passed last week by the GOP-controlled House that makes continued government funding contingent on denying any money for Obamacare. How this affects you . While his drawn-out floor speech did not constitute a filibuster, it was intended to rally opposition to the state goal of Senate Democrats to restore the Obamacare funding. However, Cruz lacked support for his tactics from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other influential veterans including Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee. In the end, Cruz voted with them to open the spending plan to revisions by the Democratic-led chamber. Reid called Cruz's all-night speech a ""waste of time"" as the nation faced a possible partial shutdown of the government if Congress fails to authorize government spending beyond Monday, when the current fiscal year ends. To Reid, the tactic reflected a perspective that a ""bad day for government"" amounted to a ""good day"" for tea party conservatives. Earlier Wednesday, Corker told CNN that a better idea would be to get the bill back to the House as soon as possible so the Republican majority there can offer a compromise. ""House members are already talking about how they might respond if the defunding component ends up being stripped out,"" Corker said, adding he hoped that the Senate would ""give the House some time to respond in a thoughtful way."" With Obamacare markets for the uninsured set to open on October 1, which also begins the new fiscal year, GOP opponents consider this their last best chance to undermine or amend the health care reforms. A possible GOP counter-proposal floated by Corker would delay its full implementation for a year. He noted that Obama already postponed another component affecting business implementation of health care reforms for a year. Under the process planned by Reid, a final Senate vote on the revised spending plan would occur over the weekend to leave the House a day at most to reconsider it. However, Reid said Wednesday he wanted the Senate to complete its work on the measure as soon as possible. Cruz, as he approached the conclusion of his overnight speech, thanked the Senate staff and others ""who have endured this Bataan death march."" When he began at 2:40 p.m. Tuesday, Cruz said he intended to ""speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand."" He filled the ensuing hours with a blend of political rhetoric and emotional pleas for Republicans like Corker to unite in opposition to Obamacare.\ . Darth Vader, Sean Connery, Chinese gooseberries and other highlights . Conservative colleagues including Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida, David Vitter of Louisiana and James Inhofe of Oklahoma joined him at times to assume the main talking duties and allow Cruz to rest his vocal chords. 'Green Eggs and Ham' gets a reading . On Tuesday night, he read the Dr. Seuss children's classic ""Green Eggs and Ham"" to his daughters. As he reached 18 hours of holding the Senate floor on Wednesday morning, Cruz compared his anti-Obamacare effort to the ""Star Wars"" films. Referring to having heard someone use the phrase ""rebellion against oppression,"" Cruz said those words ""conjured up to me the rebel alliance fighting against the empire. The empire being the Washington, D.C., establishment."" ""And indeed immediately on hearing that phrase I wondered if at some point we would see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forward and say in a deep voice, `Mike Lee, I am your father.' "" Cruz said his effort ""is a fight to restore freedom to the people. This is a fight to get the Washington establishment, the empire,  to listen to the people. And just like in the 'Star Wars' movies the empire will strike back. But at the end of the day I think the rebel alliance, I think the people will prevail."" Later, he called for Senate Republicans to show the same courage as their party colleagues in the House in making a stand to defund Obamacare. He alluded to the risks faced by the signers of the Declaration of Independence, noting they were mostly wealthy landowners who faced hanging for treason for their actions. What's Ted Cruz's deal? At 9 a.m. Wednesday, Cruz was alone on the floor, except for the presiding officer, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin. Durbin and Cruz engaged in some hostile exchanges, with the Illinois Democrat accusing Cruz of trying to deny health care coverage for tens of millions of currently uninsured Americans while enjoying the benefits of a federal health care program. Cruz responded that Obamacare was flawed and hurting the country, and the focus should be on a better solution instead of continuing on with a failed system. What you need to know about the possible shutdown . Two sides battle it out on social media . Earlier, Cruz sought to define his battle as purely about principle, saying: ""This fight is not about any member of this body. This fight is not about personalities."" ""Look, most Americans could not give a flying flip about a bunch of politicians in Washington,"" he said. ""Who cares? Almost all of us are in cheap suits with bad haircuts! Who cares?"" Supporters cheered him on through social media, and #StandWithCruz became one of the most popular hashtags on Twitter. But supporters of the health care law made themselves heard as well. On Wednesday morning, the two sides were battling it out in the top trending topic in the United States: ""Obamacare."" 5 strange things about debt ceiling politics . Key Republicans critical of Cruz strategy . Cruz also has been the target of criticism by some top Republicans. GOP infighting over how best to prevent a government shutdown while defunding Obamacare escalated Tuesday as McConnell publicly dismissed Cruz's more confrontational strategy. Cruz's GOP critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal, arguing there is no way to stop Obamacare as long as Democrats maintain control of the Senate and Obama is in the White House. They believe that trying to do so by forcing a shutdown -- or preventing an increase in the debt ceiling next month -- will backfire by harming the economy and damaging the Republican brand. What happens in a government shutdown . The Treasury Department said Wednesday that the debt ceiling -- which is the amount the federal government can borrow to pay its bills -- must be raised by October 17 to prevent a possible default. House Republicans say they will propose a package of measures that includes a one-year delay in full implementation of Obamacare to a proposal to extend the debt limit for a year. House Republican leaders met Wednesday evening to discuss the policy priorities they plan to attach. But there are signs leadership is running into resistance from conservatives, some of whom do not want additional borrowing. Others want to add new items while others still question the strategy of taking up the debt bill in the middle of fight over spending and a possible government shutdown. The White House rejects negotiations on the debt issue, saying something as fundamental as ensuring the good credit of the United States must be above politics. The last debt ceiling fight in Congress in 2011 caused the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and Obama and top Democrats warn playing politics with the issue now will cause economic harm amid the still fragile recovery.

"Augusta, Maine (CNN)When Bill Stokes visits a cafe near the state Capitol, he admires one man behind the counter. To him, Chuck Petrucelly represents a life saved. Stokes headed the Maine attorney general's criminal division when his office accepted Petrucelly's insanity plea in the 2008 killing of his brother. ""I take some measure of satisfaction from the fact he's a young man who has a future,"" Stokes says. ""We had an opportunity to save him. Unfortunately, the wheels of justice kicked in after a horrific tragedy. ""There's no punishment I can give Chuck that's worse than the punishment he gives himself whenever he thinks about his brother."" The former prosecutor and one-time Augusta mayor was recently appointed a Superior Court judge. He sees Petrucelly's recovery from multiple viewpoints. As a citizen, civic leader, head prosecutor and judge. Petrucelly is one of 90 mentally ill people in Maine designated as not criminally responsible -- known as NCR patients -- because they were determined to be insane at the time of the crimes. Nineteen had faced murder charges. The rest were charged with an array of offenses, including aggravated assault, arson, stalking and sexual misconduct. ""As a prosecutor, you can't be so rigid you reject the idea that there really are people who are truly insane,"" Stokes says. ""The people I'm worried about are not the forensics patients, because they're getting the best treatment you can imagine. The people I'm worried about are the people who are severely mentally ill not getting treatment. They're the next case that I don't want to see."" Petrucelly was sent to the state psychiatric hospital with the goal of rehabilitation. He remained there for 4½ years and moved out of the hospital more than a year ago. Now 29, he lives alone in a supervised apartment in downtown Augusta. He tries not to dwell on the past. His brother was a year older; the two had been inseparable growing up. They played Nintendo, lifted weights and shared that indescribable bond of brotherhood. ""There's just a connection I had with him that I just don't have with anybody else, and nothing can replace it,"" Petrucelly says. ""Mike really was my best friend. That might be hard to believe with what happened. ""The past is very hard to work through."" The biggest aid in his recovery, he says, was the forgiveness of his six other siblings and his mother, who remains his greatest advocate. ""You don't give up on one of your sons,"" says Rosanne Towle, his mother. ""Losing Mike was devastating and still is. Part of me is broken. But Chuck is here and he still needs us. So our focus is on him."" Focus on rehabilitation . Maine's NCR statute says that a defendant is not criminally responsible by reason of insanity ""if, at the time of the criminal conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, the defendant lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the criminal conduct."" Each defendant undergoes rigorous psychiatric assessment. About 5% of the state's cases result in a person being found not criminally responsible. ""Once that decision is made, the focus shifts from punishment to rehabilitation, treatment and public safety,"" Stokes says. The length of a stay depends on how a patient responds to treatment. That can range from a couple of years to decades. Typically, the younger the patient is on arrival, officials say, the better likelihood of a quicker recovery. The program has been in place for more than 50 years, but was revamped after an NCR patient on a four-hour leave in 1985 killed a teenage girl. Stricter laws govern today's treatment program. That case also led to creation of the State Forensic Service, which conducts psychiatric and psychological evaluations for the court system. In the three decades since, state officials say, no NCR patient has committed a violent felony upon return to the community. ""The history of the experience speaks volumes,"" says Mary Mayhew, commissioner of Maine's Department of Health and Human Services. ""We don't have an experience of recidivism. ... We're focused on recovery and the evidence-based standards of care. It's slow. It's thorough. The assessments and progress are comprehensive and are consistently being evaluated."" Patients who once refused treatment, who could hardly utter a coherent sentence, begin to surrender to therapy, start taking medication and over time become functional. The treatment plan is based on incremental freedoms and stringent rules. As they progress, they can petition the court to move into a group home after years of therapy, then to a supervised apartment. Eventually, they can seek full release, as happened recently with a mother who starved her 5-year-old daughter to death in 1993. Other states have similar programs, but the approach and aggressiveness of the releases vary. While Maine has shown success in rehabilitating its patients, other states haven't fared so well. Dr. Fuller Torrey, a research psychiatrist, best-selling author and founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, has been tracking patients who killed again upon their release into the community. ""There is no shortage of them,"" he says. Once patients have undergone treatment, Torrey says, ""it is imperative to then guarantee to the community, as well as to the person, that this individual will remain on medication indefinitely. And that's the issue."" States have an incentive to move patients into the community and out of the hospital quickly, Torrey says, because the federal government picks up the cost when patients live in the community. And that, Torrey says, has resulted with patients being let go too soon and with drastic consequences. Ann LeBlanc, director of Maine's State Forensic Service, says authorities work extremely hard to make sure that doesn't happen. ""What we know from years of research,"" she says, ""if people make that transition too soon, they tend to have multiple offenses, dangerous behavior. So we go very slowly through that process."" She often faces heated questions, even among friends and family, about why the state allows mentally ill patients, especially those who have killed, back into the community. She tells them: ""That mental illness is treated and stable, and that they've had years to work hard and demonstrate that stability."" ""It's a slow, stepwise process,"" LeBlanc says. ""We keep an eye out for the safety of the community, and the hospital makes proposals based on what the patient wants or needs. The judge decides."" Since 2001, when Stokes took over the Maine attorney general's criminal division, 12 people have been deemed not criminally responsible in murder cases. Most killed a family member or somebody close to them. Five others who sought NCR status were rejected at trial and sentenced to prison. ""There's always that concern that someone is gaming the system -- that someone is pretending to be insane when they're not in order to avoid criminal responsibility,"" Stokes says. ""We're very conscious of that."" Yet officials acknowledge there is no crystal ball, no way to predict how a patient will react upon release. The question they face most from an astonished public is: How do you know they won't kill again? ""There are no guarantees,"" says LeBlanc, ""and oftentimes I think the community is looking for a guarantee when we can't provide that about anybody. ""What we can say is these people that are under the commissioner's custody get the best care; they get the care that they need; they get the supervision they need so they can have a life."" Petrucelly has begun his new life, but there are hitches. Every time he seeks more freedom, he must appear before court. That results in a local headline like: ""Central Maine man who fatally stabbed brother can move to apartment, judge says."" He says local reporters never ask to speak with him, never seek his side of the story. His mom wishes they'd stop running his arraignment photograph in which he was 150 pounds, in psychosis and looks totally out of it. If they'd just ask to take a new photo, his mother would be happy. ""It sets up people to be afraid of me,"" Petrucelly says. The cafe where he works has accepted him and remains supportive. Making Reuben sandwiches isn't his ultimate goal. With a hulking 220-pound frame, Petrucelly hopes to become a fitness instructor one day. He can bench-press 425 pounds. Residents have no reason to fear him, he says. ""The people who have had treatment, like myself, are not the ones that they need to worry about. Myself specifically, I'm aware of my illness,"" he says. ""I'm aware of the fact that I need to take meds to remain stable or I need to watch how I'm thinking and manage my thoughts."" He's determined to make his late brother proud of his recovery. ""Part of the reason I don't give up on myself,"" he says, ""is I know that my brother wouldn't want that. I know he'd want me to honor his memory in whatever way I can. Every day that I live and get up, I don't take it for granted because I know he doesn't have that now.""","Maine program aims to rehabilitate those deemed insane, not criminally responsible .

"Los Angeles (CNN)The man whose hit-and-run death led to the arrest of former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight was also a former rap label owner as well as a father figure to wayward youths and gang members, a friend said Friday. Terry Carter, 55, wasn't a product of the thug life, but he did found and own the defunct Heavyweight Records, said friend Darcell Carraway, 38. Carter mentored young men to a better life, Carraway said. His death ""will bring a lot of people together, you know, from all different walks of life, Bloods, Crips, ex-gang members, current gang members, whatever, people on the streets, foster kids, whatever the case may be,"" Carraway said. ""It's a sad day for them,"" he added. Carter was also a friend and acquaintance of Knight through their work in making rap records, said Carraway, who was a writer for Heavyweight Records during its business run between 1997 and 2000. ""They became friends through mutual friends, and they hit it off and they were cool,"" Carraway said. ""From my understanding, they had no issues whatsoever. They were friends. They respected each other. ""To my knowledge, there was no altercations ever whatsoever between him and Suge Knight,"" Carraway said. Knight is being held in lieu of $2 million bond in the death of Carter pending a court appearance, which isn't expected until at least Monday, according to Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. ""Knight arrested for murder in connection to fatal traffic incident in Compton,"" the Los Angeles County Sheriff tweeted. Police in Los Angeles say a man matching Knight's description drove over Carter and another man with his red pickup truck in Compton, a city adjacent to south Los Angeles that's renowned in rap music. The pickup truck driver ran over the two men again as he sped away from the scene. The condition of the second man, Cle Sloan, 51, wasn't disclosed by police. ""So far, people we talked to said it looked like it was an intentional act. So we're handling it as a homicide,"" Los Angeles police Lt. John Corina said. The hit-and-run stemmed from an argument Knight allegedly had on the set of the N.W.A. biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" and then spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers. The film is about how ""the group NWA emerges from the streets of Compton, California in the mid-1980s and revolutionizes pop culture with their music and tales about life in the hood,"" according to IMDB. One character is named Suge Knight, and other characters are named after other prominent rap figures, IMDB says. Paul Giamatti is among the cast. Universal Pictures listed a release date of August 14. On the violent streets of south Los Angeles, Carter had urged a better life for youths and young men, Carraway said. ""He was just a father figure basically to me and an array of others who were inner-city youth, troubled youth, gang members, ex-gang members, that type of thing,"" Carraway said. ""He was a person that reached out to a lot of people to help then get on their feet, helped them put food on their tables, helped them become entrepreneurs. He gave a lot of direction to a lot of us who didn't have fathers growing up and things of that nature,"" Carraway said. ""He taught us positive stuff."" More recently, Carraway saw Carter at Carter's grandson's birthday party on December 20, Carraway said. ""Because of people like Terry, I was able to put my foot forward and make something of myself,"" Carraway said. Knight, 49, turned himself in to Los Angeles Sheriff's Department investigators early Friday. CNN affiliate KCAL-TV and the Los Angeles Times quoted Knight's attorney, James Blatt, as saying Knight feared for his life and was trying to flee when the incident happened. ""We feel strongly Mr. Knight did not do anything wrong in this matter. He was attacked by a number of individuals, that has already been corroborated by certain witnesses. He left the scene because he was in fear for his safety and life,"" he said. In a conversation with CNN before the arrest, Blatt declined to confirm to CNN whether Knight was driving. Police say Knight allegedly tracked the two men to the lot. ""A red pickup truck is involved in this, and those people were also at the other altercation, so yes, it all suggests that he was the person driving that truck,"" Corina said. ""It looks like he drove backward and struck the victims. And then went forward and struck them again as he left,"" Corina said. Officers later found Knight's Ford Raptor abandoned in Westwood. Early Friday, Knight, accompanied by his lawyer, turned himself in at the West Hollywood Sheriff's Station, where homicide detectives were interviewing him. Knight founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991, signing artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (since then known as Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. But then his fortunes began to dwindle with a series of run-ins with the law. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were wounded in a shoorting while they were inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. In October, he was busted along with comedian Micah ""Katt"" Williams for allegedly stealing a photographer's camera. ""Straight Outta Compton,"" the movie set where the argument began Thursday, chronicles the rise of N.W.A, one of the most controversial rap acts of all time. Who is Suge Knight? CNN's Michael Martinez, Sara Sidner, Jason Kravarik, Sonya Hamasaki and Stella Chan reported from Los Angeles. Tina Burnside, Saeed Ahmed and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Killed was Terry Carter, 55, a former rap label owner and ""father figure"" on L.A. streets .

"All government shutdowns are not created equal. In 1995 and 1996, disagreement over federal spending levels between the Republican-controlled Congress -- led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- and then-President Bill Clinton led the government to partially shut down twice. Government services were cut, federal workers were furloughed and hostility toward politicians grew. Now that a government shutdown has happened again -- this time after the Senate, run by Democrats, and the GOP-controlled House couldn't come to an agreement on funding the government by midnight on Tuesday -- it would be easy to compare the two shutdowns. The reality: the atmosphere, the lack of negotiations between leaders and the economy were all different in 1995, and this most recent shutdown is markedly different. Here is why: . 1. Clinton and Gingrich were open to compromise . During the 1995-1996 shutdowns, the House speaker and the president, despite their political differences, were more willing to negotiate on policy issues. ""Bill Clinton and I would talk, if not every day ... we would talk five days a week before the shutdown, after the shutdowns,"" said Gingrich. ""We met face to face for 35 days in the White House trying to hammer things out. When you get to know somebody, even when you're fighting hard, you kind of understand where the other person is coming from and they're not some demonized figure."" That is not the case with President Barack Obama and Speaker John Boehner, whose relationship has been sullied by a number of difficult negotiations and failed deals on the budget and spending. They nearly reached agreement in 2011 on a ""grand bargain"" to deal with taxes and entitlement spending. But the deal fell through at the last minute and they haven't spent much time together since. Obama and Boehner spoke Monday night as the clock ticked down on government shutdown and, according to a Boehner spokesman, ""the call lasted nearly 10 minutes."" It was their first conversation in 10 days. After the call, Boehner took to the floor and debriefed the call with the president by impersonating him. ""I talked to the president earlier tonight: 'I'm not going to negotiate, I'm not going to negotiate, I'm not going to do this,'"" Boehner said. ""Well, I would say to the president, this is not about me. And it's not about Republicans here in Congress. It's about fairness for the American people."" Gingrich said this lack of contact is the problem. ""The biggest difference I sense between the Obama-Boehner relationship and the Clinton-Gingrich relationship is just simply frequency of conversation,"" Gingrich, a host of CNN's ""Crossfire,"" said on the show. 2. Partisanship is deeper . With congressional districts that are more Republican or Democratic than ever, there are few moderates left on Capitol Hill today. This has led to a more hyper-partisan Congress, where the parties appear to be farther apart than they ever were in the past. ""In the '80s and '90s there was the ability for both sides, no matter how difficult the issue, to come together and arrive at compromise and solve problems,"" Chuck Konigsberg, assistant director of the White House Office of Management and Budget during the 1995 shutdown, said in an interview with CNN. ""Now, there is such an ideological bent to many of these issues, that it is difficult to overcome the gridlock."" Konigsberg said today's Republican members, ""instead of focusing on the general election where people tend to tack to the political center, are more worried about primary challenges from the far right."" And according to a 2013 study from Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, the government shutdowns of 1995-1996 could have led to the partisanship that is now gripping Washington. Although the 1995 Congress was the most partisan in more than 100 years, according to the study, the level of polarization since the shutdown has remained higher than it ever was before then. ""This level of polarization could be self-reinforcing,"" James Moody of Duke University and Peter Mucha of UNC wrote. ""Since success in middle positions requires coalitions and trust that are unlikely, given so many party loyalists."" 3. The economy, then and now . When the government shut down in 1995-96, the economy was booming, primarily because of Silicon Valley, the burgeoning tech sector and Internet startups. Unemployment was at 5.6% and most economic forecasts saw further growth. The same could not be said for the current state of this economy. Amid a sluggish recovery, unemployment has slowly shrunk to 7.3%, but labor participation -- the number of people who have a job or are looking for one -- is at the lowest rate since August 1978. Could a government shutdown damage the fragile economy? It depends on whom you ask. Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, told Congress last week that economic growth would slow during a shutdown. But Tad Dehaven, budget analyst for the CATO Institute, told CNN he believes that economy would be fine during a shutdown, primarily because of how the economy performed in 1995. ""The last time we had a government shutdown, the stock market was fine,"" he said. ""The economy was fine."" Most economists agree, however, that the economic impact of a government shutdown depends greatly on how long the shutdown lasts. But according to some estimates, the a shutdown could cost the still-struggling U.S. economy roughly $1 billion a week just in pay lost by furloughed federal workers. ""If it's a relatively short shutdown, it's a minor headache,"" said Brian Kessler, economist with Moody's Analytics. ""But if it lasts several weeks, the people affected start to act like they're unemployed. They delay larger purchases. That's why you start to see a significantly greater effect the longer it goes."" But the economic impact of an extended government shutdown will be more than just lost wages by federal workers. -- With national parks and museums closed, tourism will be affected. -- The Small Business Authority will be unable to process loan applications, meaning a dent in small-business growth. -- Federal contractors would also have to cut back on staffing.","1995-'96 shutdowns were in a politically and economically different time .
Those years, political leaders were more willing to negotiate .
With districts more partisan, there are fewer moderates in the House today .
Unlike today, the mid-'90s economy was booming ."
"A flight to America's adult playground, Las Vegas, had an unusual passenger last week: a 9-year-old boy traveling on his own, apparently without a ticket. The boy went through security with all other passengers, the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement, but officials are still trying to figure out how he did it -- and how he then got on the flight. Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, said the crew of Delta Flight 1651 ""became suspicious of the child's circumstances"" during the flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas. Crew members got in touch with authorities in Las Vegas and turned the boy over to Child Protective Services, Hogan said in a statement. ""Fortunately, the flight crew took appropriate actions to ensure the child's safety, so the story does have a good ending,"" he said. Delta said it takes the incident ""very seriously"" and is working with authorities. The airline spells out its policy about children flying solo plainly on its website. Children between the ages of 5 and 14 may travel alone as part of the unaccompanied minor program. Someone from Delta pays special attention to the children, walks them on board, shows them their seats and even introduces them to the cockpit crew, time permitting, Delta says, adding, ""Kids love this part."" Airport officials reviewed security footage and don't think the child had a ticket, CNN affiliate KARE reported. The boy, a runaway from the Twin Cities, spent a good amount of time at the airport before boarding the plane, KARE said. He was there the day before, the station reported, citing airport officials. He passed his time by taking luggage from a carousel, bringing it to an airport eatery and then ditching it, asking a server to watch the bag ""while he went to the restroom."" The following day the child took the train to the airport, cleared security and made it to Las Vegas nearly without detection. ""Obviously, the fact that the child's actions weren't detected until he was in flight is concerning,"" Hogan wrote. Still, 33 million people travel through Minneapolis' airport every year, he noted. ""I don't know of another instance in my 13 years at the airport in which anything similar has happened,"" he said. Man pleads guilty to slapping crying boy on Delta flight . A flight security expert said it's very concerning that the child made it through several security checks. ""All of this (security) since 9/11 has been to keep us safe. And it has, but still we have gaping holes, and this is a perfect example of it,"" Terry Trippler of ThePlaneRules.com told KARE. The incident may be a first for Minneapolis, but over the years other airports have had similar incidents. In 2007, another 9-year-old managed to fly from Seattle to Phoenix to San Antonio before being found out. He had a boarding pass, though. His mother told CNN her son gave ticketing agents a fake name. Last year an 11-year-old boy in Manchester, England, managed to slip away from his mother during a shopping trip. He made it all the way to Rome without a boarding pass or a passport. But any Colosseum dreams were dashed. He never left the airport in Rome and was returned to his parents the same day.","The TSA says the boy went through security with all other passengers .

"(CNN)Sorry, I can't contain my excitement about this one. Remember the #LikeAGirl video, which became a sensation last summer? It's now been viewed online more than 80 million times worldwide, according to the company behind it, Always, a maker of sanitary pads. And it's about to reach even more viewers. The powerful video so clearly demonstrated how the phrase ""like a girl"" gins up negative and weak stereotypes. When adolescent girls, older women and boys were asked to demonstrate how to ""run like a girl"" or ""fight like a girl,"" their arms flailed as they ran and awkwardly slapped instead of throwing powerful punches. Contrast that with prepubescent girls, girls 10 and younger, who when asked to do the same thing ran as fast as they could and hit as hard as they could. They were girls on fire, and to them, running ""like a girl"" meant nothing more than running like themselves. Well, a 60-second version of this video is about to get its biggest audience by far when it is showcased during the Super Bowl on Sunday. To give you a sense of the possible reach, more than 110 million people around the world watched the game last year. Meet the Puppy Bowl contestants! Fama Francisco, vice president of Global Always, said the company has been thrilled with the response to the ad -- including over 54 million online views alone for the English version -- but determined that the most-watched television event of the year could take the message even further. ""We've only reached one half of our girls in the United States and ... even fewer boys and men with the message, so I think with such a powerful message like this and the fact that we know it's already making an impact and changing perceptions, there's no better platform than the Super Bowl."" Francisco said the power of the ad is twofold. It illuminates the real and serious issue of the drop in self-confidence that girls go through at puberty and how attitudes can shift just by watching the video. She cited a study of 1,800 Americans between the ages of 16 to 49, which was conducted by the group Research Now in December. Among girls ages 16 to 24, 76% no longer said they saw the phrase ""like a girl"" as an insult after watching the video, she said. Two out of three men who saw it said they would stop or think twice before using the phrase ""like a girl"" in a negative way. ""It's already making an impact and changing perceptions. There's no better platform than the Super Bowl to reach over 100 million people to spread the message and redefine the meaning of 'like a girl,' "" Francisco added. This Super Bowl ad will leave you speechless . No word on the cost of the 60-second spot, but it is probably in the millions. CNN's Brian Stelter reported that 30-second spots for Sunday night's game on NBC cost $4.5 million. Lauren Greenfield is a critically acclaimed director and photographer whose past works include the film ""THIN"" about eating disorders, the documentary ""The Queen of Versailles"" about the economic collapse in 2008 and the book ""Girl Culture"" on body image. She directed the ""Like a Girl"" video, which involved interviews with more than 100 people. ""The fact that 'Like a Girl' is playing at the Super Bowl is so exciting and important because it puts the message broadly into the mainstream, in front of men as well as women,"" said Greenfield, who happens to also be a friend of my husband's and mine. ""As we gather to celebrate one of the most important days in sports, 'Like a Girl' reminds a giant audience that we need to empower our daughters, sisters, and mothers to be their best,  and that means playing ball and living life 'like a girl,' "" said Greenfield, who received a Directors Guild of America award nomination for the commercial. She says she's the first solo female director to get a nod in the commercial category. ""I am very proud that I also broke through a barrier by directing 'Like a Girl,' "" she added. NFL off-field woes tainting Super Bowl? After a year in which the NFL has faced questions about how it handles domestic violence against women and campus sexual assaults have garnered national headlines, the #LikeAGirl ad could have an impact beyond the phrase itself, some women say. ""It is hugely significant that the #LikeAGirl commercial is being shown during the Super Bowl. The ad turns a negative stereotype of girls on its head during one of the largest sporting events watched by men (and women) all over the country,"" said Jennifer Siebel Newsom, filmmaker and founder and chief executive officer of the nonprofit The Representation Project. The Representation Project is paying close attention to what ads are shown during the Super Bowl. It is collaborating with The 3% Conference to host the second annual Super Bowl Tweetup to monitor the portrayal of women in ads during the game. Siebel Newsom said stereotypes don't just hurt women. They hurt boys, girls and men, too, she said. ""Especially after such a destructive year for the NFL (and the women affected by it), I hope we get to a place where we are not relying on gender stereotypes to divide us and instead can work together for a healthier culture for all,"" she added. Her newest film, ""The Mask You Live In,"" about the impact our narrow definition of masculinity is having on boys, men and society, just premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. In addition to unveiling a 60-second clip of the video during the Super Bowl, Always is sending Karlie Harman, a 15-year-old quarterback and the only girl on her football team in Northern Virginia, to the Super Bowl as a #LikeAGirl ambassador. The brand is encouraging people to share the video and what they proudly do #LikeAGirl on social media during the game. ""We can change the meaning of words. That's what we are taking a stand on, and our message, which we hope will inspire girls, women, boys, is that we can make the everyday 'like a girl' to mean amazing things,"" Always' Francisco said. ""I think our girls deserve that."" What do you think about the #LikeAGirl ad being shown during the Super Bowl?

The group has launched many deadly terrorist attacks, including one on a popular mall in Kenya in 2013. The Westgate Mall attack lasted four days and killed dozens. Mohamed left the United States in the summer of 2012 attempting to join Al Shabaab, the FBI said. Interpol has sought him ever since. ""Not only did he choose to go to Somalia and fight with Al Shabaab, he took a prominent role in trying to recruit people to fight for Al Shabaab,"" said Carl Ghatas, special agent in charge of the counterterrorism division at the FBI's Washington field office.

"We are online more than ever, glued to computers at work, and smartphones and tablets at home, during commutes and everywhere in between. But how are we filling up all that extra screen time other than checking social media, playing games and reading articles? We're watching videos, preferably funny ones. Since 2009, the percentage of adults watching or downloading online videos has gone up from 69% to 78%, according to new research from the Pew Internet & American Life Project. The most popular way of viewing clips is streaming them through video-sharing sites such as YouTube, followed by regular websites, apps and via social media. Thirty-six percent of people bother to download entire video files. Comedy videos are hands down the most popular genre, holding on to the No. 1 spot from four years ago. Fifty-eight percent of adults are giggling along to comedy videos, and 56% are getting guidance from how-to videos. Music videos also have taken off in those four years, and now half of adults watch them. Pornography was at the bottom of the list of video categories -- after sports and advertisements. Only 12% of people reported watching adult videos online. Twenty-five percent of men admitted to viewing adult content, while 8% of female respondents did. Regular people are filming and uploading a large chunk of online videos. In four years, the percentage of American adults posting videos online has shot up from 14% to 31%. The majority of people are uploading a video someone else created, but 18% of online adults shot and shared videos themselves. The publicly shared moments are mostly mundane -- 58% of the shooters are uploading clips of people they know doing ""everyday"" things. The next most popular subject matter is people shooting themselves and their friends hamming it up for the camera for a laugh. Finally, 54% shared videos of events they attended, which may explain what the sea of people watching concerts through their smartphones instead of looking at the stage do with their videos. Smartphones play a big role in the surge in amateur filmmakers. Anyone with a smartphone or tablet can capture spontaneous moments or whip up their own attempts at stardom. Forty percent of adults are recording video on their phones, and 41% are watching videos from the devices. Not surprisingly, a bit of stardom is what many people are aiming for with their videos. More than a third of the people posting videos online hope one of their creations will go viral. Five percent of people posting videos regretted sharing something in the past. Pew credits sharing sites such as YouTube and Vimeo as being the ""main driving force"" behind the video-watching trend. Back in 2006, 33% of people said they were using these types of sites. Now that number is 72%. Apps such as Vine and other social media tools are becoming a popular way to share and consume videos directly from a phone. The study was part of Pew's ongoing look at how Americans use the Internet. The phone survey of 1,003 American adults was conducted in July. The sampling error was plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.","Percentage of U.S. adults uploading videos has doubled since 2009, a Pew study says .

"Transportation officials in New York suspended overnight track maintenance on the city's transit system this weekend as workers combed the underground network for a missing teenager with autism. Avonte Oquendo, 14, was last seen on surveillance video running out of Center Boulevard School in Long Island City on the afternoon of October 4. The teenager, who is unable to communicate verbally, is fascinated by trains, according to his family, and officials have shifted their search underground, a spokesman for the New York Police Department told CNN Sunday. Searches of train stations, tracks and tunnels were also conducted late last week, according to Paul J. Fleuranges of the Metropolitan Transit Authority. A $70,000 reward has been offered for Avonte's safe return. David Perecman, the Oquendo family's attorney, told CNN last week that he is taking steps to investigate how Avonte was able to escape school grounds unsupervised. ""Right now, we have submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the city and the various agencies involved, in order to obtain the information for us to know what occurred,"" Perecman said. Avonte's mother says the situation is ""heartbreaking."" ""I just need to find my son because he needs his family; he cannot fend for himself out there,"" Vanessa Fontaine told CNN affiliate WABC last week. ""This is just the hardest thing to have your child disappear, and you cannot bring him home with you,"" she said. According to the surveillance video provided by the police department, no supervisor or monitor stopped the 14-year-old when he ran out. ""He is supposed to have one-to-one supervision at all times,"" Fontaine said through tears. ""He has the mental capacity of a 7- or 8-year-old."" The New York City Department of Education issued a statement saying it is working closely with the police on the investigation. The school is not commenting. The Oquendo family filed a ""notice of claim"" Wednesday, said Perecman, marking the first step of a civil lawsuit against the city of New York. He declined to give further information regarding the claim. Police say Avonte was last seen wearing a gray-striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. He is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds. Missing posters are being handed out, and the surrounding areas are under investigation, WABC reported. ""He doesn't know that, you know, 'I can get hurt in the street, someone can grab me and take me.' He doesn't know that,"" Fontaine said Monday. ""He doesn't know fear.""

"(CNN) -- A magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck the central Philippines on Tuesday, leaving at least 99 people dead and 276 more injured, and rattling many who were celebrating a religious holiday. The quake, which struck early in the morning, crumbled a number of buildings and sent panicked people streaming into the streets, witnesses said. The bulk of the casualties -- 90 deaths and 166 injuries -- came in Bohol province. At least nine were killed in Cebu province and one died in the province of Siquijor, the Philippines News Agency reported, citing the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Most of those killed were hit by falling rubble, the agency reported. So far, nearly 2.9 million people from 560,000 families have been affected. Dozens of people were missing, and authorities were checking into reports of people trapped in collapsed buildings in Cebu and Bohol, the agency reported. Landslides were reported in Cebu, according to the disaster council, which also reported stampedes at two venues in that province, as well as damage to a port terminal, an airport tower, a fish port, a public market, schools, churches, hospitals, bridges, roads, government buildings and residences across Bohol, Cebu and outlying areas. Power was restored to most affected areas, except Bohol province, the city of Cadiz and part of the city of Iloilo. The quake was centered about 620 kilometers (385 miles) south-southeast of Manila, near Catigbian, and its depth was 20 kilometers (12 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Philippines disaster council gave the temblor a slightly higher rating, 7.2 magnitude, than the USGS. Maryann Zamora, a communications specialist with the charity World Vision, reported seeing glass and concrete in the streets of the city of Cebu, about 60 kilometers north of the epicenter. ""Right now we are in the streets because it is unsafe to be inside,"" she said by phone, her voice shaking as one of more than 10 aftershocks hit. ""Tell everyone to pray for us."" iReport: 'Our building is not safe' Tuesday was a national holiday, the beginning of the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. There was no widespread threat of a tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said, but it warned that earthquakes this large can sometimes cause tsunamis within 100 kilometers of the epicenter. Catigbian, which has a population of 23,000, is in the province of Bohol. Tourist Robert Michael Poole said he was riding a bike in Bohol when the earthquake struck and cracked the road in front of him. ""It was very strong,"" Poole said. ""I live in Tokyo. I am used to earthquakes. But this one was very strong. It shocked a lot of people here."" Poole said he was able to move around and document some of the destruction, including a giant church that was decimated.

"Thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers across the country felt the effects of the government shutdown on Friday as their modest living allowances were reduced by more than a third due to a lack of funding. ""I did not know until this week what my stipend would look like and then I found out it was going to be 65% of what I generally would expect,"" said Jeffery Kearney, 30, a volunteer in Washington. The shortage affects more than 2,000 participants in the AmeriCorps VISTA program who make a year-long commitment to work at nonprofit organizations or public agencies on projects to fight poverty. The VISTA living allowance is based on the federal poverty level, and helps volunteers pay for basic living expenses during their service, meaning even a minor reduction can force them to make some tough decisions. House proposals emerge that address debt ceiling but not shutdown . ""It means that some real decisions have to be made,"" said Kearney, whose $300 pay check was cut to approximately $200 on Friday. ""It literally means either a cell phone payment or a student loan payment."" Kearney and his wife moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, in 2010 after receiving master's degrees at the University of Arkansas. Combined the couple has more than $200,000 in student loans and count on Kearney's paycheck to help keep up with their payments. Founded by John F. Kennedy in 1965 as Volunteers in Service to America, today VISTA participants receive a living allowance every two weeks, and at the end of their service they're eligible for a scholarship, which in 2012 was worth $5,500. ""They've been asked to continue to serve, they're getting a partial payment this month, they don't know what's going to happen next month, so their future's really uncertain,"" said Ben Duda, executive director of AmeriCorps Alums. ""We were talking to someone on Twitter who said it was literally a choice of do I pay rent or do I buy groceries."" Federal workers' bad day -- 40% less in paycheck . The paycheck volunteers received on Friday represents compensation for the last pay period in September, but nothing for the first days of October. Under AmeriCorps rules, volunteers are prohibited from getting a second job to help bring in extra money. If they drop out of the program, they become ineligible for the year-end scholarship. In Kearney's case, he and his wife are counting on that scholarship to help cover student loan costs while he looks for a job next fall. Zach Maurin, executive director of Service Nation, a group that advocates on behalf of organizations like AmeriCorps, said, ""Part of the culture of the organization is that to best understand people in poverty you have to live in poverty,"" said. AmeriCorps and the VISTA program are both part of the Corporation for National and Community Service. In the agency's contingency plan posted before the shutdown, it outlines that for ""non-grant, non-cost share VISTAs, the living allowance will continue to accrue but not be paid until funding is restored."" There's also a new class of volunteers waiting to begin their assignments whose start date may be pushed back if the government isn't reopened soon. ""What makes this so troubling is you've got a group of people working on behalf of community members in poverty,"" said Maurin. ""When these members aren't on the job or can't begin their term of service you have people they're trying to help who are already on the brink of some dire circumstances. So when this level of support goes away it's really disastrous."" In the event that the government shutdown continues, Duda and his fellow alumni are exploring ways to fill the funding gap. They posted a form online to solicit information from volunteers in need and received responses from 30 organizations and more than 300 individuals in the first 30 minutes. In total, they've reached out to150 organizations and more than 640 VISTA volunteers to find out where the need is the greatest. ""Those of us who served in AmeriCorps know what that experience means and what it means to serve your country in national service,"" Duda said. ""And when we see people serving their country faced with these dire circumstances we want to do something about it."" In some cases, local organizations are stepping in to provide assistance to their volunteers, and AmeriCorps Alums is considering soliciting donations or even taking out a private loan to help make volunteers' paychecks whole. ""These are individuals who should be empowered and celebrated for the hard and critical work that they're doing and not be faced with an unnecessary and really dire set of choices to make,"" Duda said.","Shutdown will reduce checks for AmeriCorps volunteers by more than a third .

"Author Harper Lee has not published a novel in more than a half-century, but her words in federal court seek to protect the 87-year-old's best-known intellectual property, ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" The Alabama writer has sued her hometown Monroe County Heritage Museum for trademark infringement, saying it is illegally using her fame for its own gain. ""The museum seeks to profit from the unauthorized use of the protected names and trademarks of 'Harper Lee' and 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' It is a substantial business that generated over $500,000 in revenue for 2011, the last year for which figures are available,"" said the lawsuit filed last week. ""But its actual work does not touch upon history. Rather, its primary mission is to trade upon the fictional story, settings and characters that Harper Lee created."" The reclusive author still lives in the county, about 105 miles from Montgomery in the southern part of the state. It was the inspiration for the fictional Maycomb County. Set in the segregated South, the 1960 novel -- the only one Lee wrote -- won a Pulitzer Prize and was made into an Academy Award-winning movie. It deals with a local attorney's relationship with his children and his community as he defends an African-American man accused of raping a white woman during the Jim Crow 1930s. Its themes of racial injustice and waning innocence, grounded in characters possessing courage and tolerance, have inspired millions of readers. The museum fully acknowledges its most famous resident. Its website is www.tokillamockingbird.com and says it ""maintains and operates six historic sites in Monroe County, Ala., that collectively interpret the area's rich history,"" including ""the literary legacy of (fellow author) Truman Capote and Harper Lee,"" who were childhood friends. A gift shop -- called the Bird's Nest -- sells memorabilia, T-shirts, even cookware about the book, and the museum stages a ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" play each spring. An attorney for the facility strongly denied Lee's allegations. ""Every single statement in the lawsuit is either false, meritless, or both,"" said Matthew Goforth, a Birmingham-based attorney hired for the museum. ""It is sad that Harper Lee's greedy handlers have seen fit to attack the non-profit museum in her hometown that has been honoring her legacy and the town's rich history associated with that legacy for over 20 years. Unfortunately for Harper Lee, those handlers are doing nothing but squandering her money with this lawsuit. The museum is squarely within its rights to carry out its mission as it always has."" Lee in her lawsuit acknowledged the novel's impact in her community. ""The town's desire to capitalize upon the fame of 'To Kill a Mockingbird ' is unmistakable: Monroeville's town logo features an image of a mockingbird and the cupola of the Old County Courthouse, which was the setting for the dramatic trial in 'To Kill a Mockingbird.'"" Her lawyers said they had earlier attempted to stop the museum from any unauthorized commercial use of the novel, and claimed it tried to block her federal registration of the ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" trademark. ""Historical facts belong to the world, but fiction and trademarks are protected by law,"" the lawsuit says. Nelle Harper Lee -- her full name -- separately settled a lawsuit last month in which she claimed she was ""duped"" into signing over the copyright to her book six years ago. Her current lawsuit says the novel still sells about a million copies a year. The current case is Lee v. Monroe County Heritage Museum, Inc. (1:13-cv-490).","Harper Lee sues Monroe County Heritage Museum in her hometown .

"Alan Gamez remembers the sadness he used to feel just looking in the mirror. ""My stomach was huge,"" said Gamez, now 18. ""I would just look at myself and be disappointed."" Obese throughout childhood, Gamez weighed 270 pounds his freshman year of high school. He felt like he had no friends that year. ""I would overeat because I really had no social life in school,"" he said. He decided not to play baseball as a freshman because he thought his weight would hinder his performance. ""He was unhappy in all aspects of his life, and he took it out on his physical well-being,"" Gomez's high school counselor Mary Abbott wrote in a letter nominating Gamez for the Denver Mayor's Youth Award. ""Alan had no control over his life. Thankfully, this is not the Alan Gamez of today."" In his sophomore year, Gamez decided to make a change. It started when he took an exercise health and wellness class, which taught him about nutrition and exercise. He remembers entering this class ""a little shy,"" but became interested in the basics of working out and eating right. The hardest part, he said, was overhauling his eating habits. Gamez was accustomed to eating a lot, and often -- eight times a day. His mother would make enchiladas or fried beans; in between meals, Gamez would snack on ice cream or chips. ""It was just what made me feel good,"" he said. Have you lost weight? Share your story on iReport . Determined to change, Gamez stopped eating red meat and got his protein instead from chicken and fish. He made sure his caloric intake was between 1,500 and 2,000 calories each day. Once his mother noticed a change in him, she started cooking differently, too, Gamez said. His mother would go to his meetings with his dietitian, and the conversations opened her eyes about making better food choices, Gamez said. At first, Gamez was too shy to even run around the block near his home. Every morning he would privately exercise in an alley near his home. ""I would really not see changes in me,"" he remembers. ""I would still believe I was obese and stuff, but every time I would go out to a family party, people would tell me, 'Wow, you've changed a lot.' I really didn't see it until I started noticing that I had to buy new clothes."" In about four months, he went from wearing clothes sized 2XL down to large, and eventually down to a medium. His pants size shrunk from 42 to 36, and then from there to 32. ""After a year, when I went back into school my junior year, that's when I thought I was -- not perfect -- but I felt comfortable in my body,"" he said. By the first semester of his junior year, he had dropped 100 pounds, weighing in at 170 the first semester. The change wasn't only physical. Gamez joined the baseball team at a high school nearby and started hanging out with the players. He found that more people were talking to him. ""I told some people what I was doing so they could change their ways as well,"" he said. His now-girlfriend didn't notice him when he was at his heaviest, but after he lost weight, he started talking to her. She liked what Gamez did to combat his weight problem, he said, and the two have been together since junior year. ""My confidence went up drastically,"" he said. In the spring of 2013, Gamez was honored with the Denver Mayor's Youth Award, which celebrates teens who have overcome adversity and made positive changes. He was given a $1,000 scholarship. These days, Gamez works out at least five days a week, mostly lifting weights. Monday, he'll work his chest and back; Tuesday is biceps and triceps; Wednesday is cardio; Thursday is shoulders; and Friday is legs. On weekends, he'll be active too -- running, doing cardio exercises or playing catch with his girlfriend. He has gained weight since the end of high school -- he's up to 230 pounds -- but he's focusing on building muscle. He knows that extra pounds will come with that. Once he reaches his muscle goal, he'll go back to cardio exercises. Gamez is now a student at Colorado State University. He wants to major in something like nutrition so that he can help others do what he did. ""He told me there is nothing greater than to watch people transform and reach their goals, knowing that they have the power to change within them,"" Abbott wrote.

"The man arrested in the dry ice explosions at Los Angeles International Airport is a baggage handler who thought the simple bombs were ""a game"" and ""a funny kind of joke,"" police said Wednesday. The explosions didn't cause any injuries, but one did cause a temporary shutdown of a terminal. Both explosions raise questions, however, about the airport's vulnerability and security, authorities say. ""This guy was playing around. It was kind of a game to him. He thought it was funny. He had no intent to attack innocent victims. There was no political motive or agenda,""  Los Angeles police Deputy Chief Michael Downing said. ""But I think he was surprised because now he is in jail on a million dollars bail. But this is serious. And when you place a destructive device near an airplane, it bumps up the seriousness,"" Downing added. ""There was nothing to worry about in terms of safety at LAX.  This was not a criminal enterprise. He thought it was a funny kind of joke.  But we take it seriously.  He was surprised when he got arrested,"" Downing said. ""I think he was kind of proud, thought it was funny."" The arrest comes on the heels of two incidents at the airport on Sunday and Monday. The suspect, identified as Dicarlo Bennett, 28, was charged in the Sunday incident, according to a Los Angeles Police Department statement. He was arrested after police interviewed his co-workers, Downing said. LAX dry ice explosions 'an internal job, maybe a labor dispute or prank' Though he was arrested in connection with both incidents, charges have been filed for only one. ""We want to reassure the traveling public, visitors and employees that LAX is safe and secure,""  Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said. The suspect is being held in lieu of $1 million bail and faces a charge of possession of an explosive or destructive device near an aircraft. Bennett is an employee of Servisair, a leading global provider of aviation ground services, the company said. ""We are aware of the arrest of Dicarlo Bennett as a suspect in the recent incidents at LAX,"" the company said in a prepared statement. ""We're cooperating with authorities and will continue to monitor the situation closely. It is important at this early stage to allow law enforcement to continue their investigation, and we do not have any further comment at this time."" The company provides aviation ground services at 118 locations worldwide, including 31 locations in the United States. An employee badge is required to get access to where the dry ice explosions occurred, said Nancy Suey Castles, an airport spokeswoman. On Sunday, dry ice in a plastic bottle exploded in an employee restroom, causing a brief shutdown of Terminal 2, the FBI said. No injuries were reported, and the terminal resumed operations after a brief evacuation. The other incident occurred about 8:30 p.m. Monday at the Tom Bradley International Terminal, airport police said, . Three plastic bottles containing dry ice were found, but only one had exploded, police said. CNN affiliate KCAL said the blast took place in an employee restroom, inaccessible to nonemployees. Nobody was injured in that incident. Dry ice, which is carbon dioxide in solid form, is used as a refrigerant for meats and ice cream, especially when shipped in a box. When dry ice becomes warm, it transforms into vapor.","Police interview co-workers and arrest baggage handler Dicarlo Bennett, 28 .

"(CNN)It was called the trial of the century and the first true reality show. O.J. Simpson went on trial for the killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman 20 years ago, in what would become a wall-to-wall televised proceeding. The heavy coverage started even before the trial began. Simpson's infamous slow-speed chase days after the slayings played out on TV screens across the country, and the original grand jury was dismissed due to excessive media coverage. Here are six unforgettable moments that helped shape the trial. 1.  A juror is caught on camera, but Judge Ito says cameras can stay . On the first day of the Simpson trial, and as defense attorney Johnnie Cochran prepared to delivered his opening statement, a camera in the courtroom captured the face of a juror. The juror was on camera for less than a second, but Judge Lance Ito had previously assured jurors that they would not be photographed or shown to the public. Ito delayed the trial, meaning the defense could not immediately follow the prosecution's opening statement. After a hearing, Ito allowed cameras to stay in the courtroom. 2. Denise Brown testifies . Nicole Brown Simpson's older sister, Denise Brown, testified that her sister was an abused wife. In February 1995, she said Simpson grabbed Nicole's crotch one night in a bar in full view of friends and strangers and proclaimed, in part, ""This is mine."" Brown also recounted an incident at the Simpson residence in which an allegedly enraged O.J. Simpson threw Nicole against a wall, destroyed some items from the house and threw both sisters out. After Brown completed her emotional testimony, defense attorney Robert Shapiro countered with a completely different image of Simpson as a warm family man, pointing to video of Simpson showing affection with the Brown family just hours before the slayings. 3. Marcia Clark asks Ito to declare 'Kato' Kaelin a hostile witness . O.J. Simpson's former houseguest Brian ""Kato"" Kaelin took the witness stand and displayed the flamboyant style that had made him a minor celebrity in the case. His version of events seemed to contradict Simpson's story, and he testified that he could not account for Simpson's whereabouts during the hours the prosecution said the killings took place. His sarcastic and evasive testimony seemed to frustrate Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark. On March 21, Kaelin sparked laughter in the courtroom when Clark asked him if he was nervous. He uttered, ""Feeling great."" He then said he was ""a little"" nervous, CourtTV reported at the time. When Clark implied that Kaelin moved into Simpson's guest house to promote his own acting career, Kaelin told her, ""I don't think we were going for the same parts."" Fed up, Clark had him declared a hostile witness, allowing her to ask him leading questions usually saved for cross-examination. 4. Detective Fuhrman pleads the 5th -- again and again and again . Former Los Angeles police Detective Mark Fuhrman invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and refused to answer questions from defense attorney Gerald Uelmen regarding whether the testimony he gave at the preliminary hearing was completely truthful or whether he had ever falsified a police report. Fuhrman had given testimony about the police investigation of the Simpson residence. He also found the infamous bloody glove. The defense tried to paint Fuhrman as a racist who planted the glove to frame Simpson, which played a major role in defining the trial as about race. Fuhrman testified he had not used the N-word in the last 10 years and branded anyone who said he had as a liar, but he later pleaded no contest to perjury charges. He is now a forensic and crime scene expert for Fox News Channel. 5. ""If it doesn't fit, you must acquit"" The rhyme became Cochran's mantra as he tried to convince jurors that the case laid out by prosecutors was inconsistent and full of holes. Although Cochran uttered the famous phrase, it was actually Uelmen who came up with it. Cochran also colorfully illustrated his theme by donning a black knit cap similar to the one prosecutors claimed Simpson wore as a disguise the night of the killings. Later he pulled on a pair of gloves similar to those the prosecution used to try to link Simpson to the crime scene. Earlier in the trial, Simpson had been asked to try on the gloves by prosecutor Christopher Darden, and they did not fit. 6. ""Not guilty"" Simpson is acquitted . Flanked by Cochran and longtime friend and attorney Robert Kardashian, Simpson stood and faced the jury as a court clerk read two ""not guilty"" verdicts on October 3, 1995. Members of Simpson's family cried tears of joy in the courtroom as the family of murder victim Ron Goldman wept just a few feet away. The moment was the third most ""universally impactful"" televised moment of the last 50 years -- behind the September 11, 2001, attacks and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 -- according to a survey by Nielsen and Sony. Testimony in the trial took about nine months, encompassing about 120 witnesses, 45,000 pages of evidence and 1,100 exhibits.","It's been 20 years since the O.J. Simpson trial .
Key moments from the trial are still ingrained in the public's memory .
The reading of the verdict was one of the most watched events in history ."
"Speaking to the nation after Congress  reached a deal to reopen the government and temporarily raise the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama said we are ""Americans first"" and need to put partisan interests aside to get things done. But can we? The recent shenanigans do not bode well for the future. The resolution of the shutdown always hinged on whether House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, would defy the tea party hard-liners in his party and allow a vote on a bill that a majority of Republicans did not support. What have we learned about Boehner's leadership, or lack thereof? We are already hearing two extreme viewpoints. Rep. Raul Labrador and other staunch conservatives and tea party members gave him kudos. Boehner's job as speaker of the House seems safe, at least for now. But others in the Republican Party, and outside of it, say Boehner needs to grow a spine to stand up against the tea party caucus and Sen. Ted Cruz, the ultimate architect of the shutdown fiasco of 2013. Such differing views about the role Boehner played and how he led his troops reflects the exact polarization that produced the fingernails-to-the-chalkboard tension that caused the shutdown face-off in the first place. GOP, Boehner take shutdown hit in new CNN poll . In press conferences and TV appearances, Cruz and House tea party members said time and time again that they were doing what the ""American people"" asked them to do. They talked about those who cheered on the government shutdown to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. But polls say most  Americans disapproved of the Republican tactics and did not want the government to shut down over Obamacare. These Americans give a historically low disapproval rating to Republicans and the tea party in particular. Those same numbers give Obama and the Democrats confidence in saying they are the ones who are actually listening to the American people. The problem for Boehner as a leader of a fractured caucus is that he is listening to only a small but loud fraction of the American electorate. The voices of this America are vengeful if they don't get their way. And their leaders were clearly able to compel Boehner to rebuff the other more mainstream and moderate America that seeks compromise and resolution. So did Boehner display good leadership? For his tea party caucus, yes. For the country, no. And yet, going to the mat for the tea party might enable Boehner to push them hard to avoid this destructive path next time. It might give him the backbone he will need to stand up to them in the coming months and listen to the other ""America"" that represents more reasonable middle-of-the-road voices. These also happen to be a majority of the country -- Republicans, Democrats and independents. They are the voters that decide presidential elections and are precisely the ones the tea party is alienating. A defeated GOP wants to unite, move on, fight another day . The bigger problem for moderate and pragmatic Republicans is that the tea party doesn't care about the Republican Party's shrinking White House prospects. But it does care about its own and about keeping control of the House of Representatives. This could be enough to get the tea party to rethink its strategy. Americans have had it. The most recent CNN poll shows 54% of Americans think it is a bad thing for the country that the GOP controls Congress. For the first time ever, polls show 60% of voters are ready to boot all of Congress out -- including their own representatives. While many strategists believe the House is still safe for Republicans, a recent Public Policy Polling survey, conducted by the Democratic pollster for MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group, suggests that the Democrats in competitive Republican districts are ahead. And Democrats need only to flip 17 districts to gain control of the House. There are 17 districts held by Republicans that Obama won in 2012. There are 17 districts held by Republicans where Obama lost by 2 points or less. These are districts where because of Boehner's poor leadership anti-tea party backlash could help Democrats win seats. Boehner's leadership will soon be tested yet again -- on immigration, the farm bill and the budget, the three issues that Obama says he will push in the remainder of his term. He can choose to be a strong leader for the tea party, or be a strong leader for the country, truly work with Obama and the Democrats, and help heal the battered image of his party and of Washington. He can seal his fate as a true leader, or as the captain of the Titanic.","Maria Cardona: Shutdown resolution hinged on whether Boehner would defy tea party .

"(CNN)He's a two-time Olympic gold medalist, successful businessman and has a killer nickname that attests to his daredevil nature on the slopes. But what Ted 'the Shred' Ligety most wants is a repeat of his triple gold-medal-winning performance at the 2013 Alpine World Ski Championships. The U.S. star took top prize in the Giant Slalom, Super Combined and Super G events in Schladming, Austria, two years ago -- the first time any skier had achieved such a feat since the legendary Jean-Claude Killly did so in 1968. Now the 30-year-old has his sights firmly set on doing it all again as he prepares to make his first appearance at the 2015 World Championships in Beaver Creek, Colorado. ""It would be awesome to repeat that,"" Ligety recently told CNN's Alpine Edge. ""There's a reason it hasn't been done in 45 years. It's because it's so hard, because so many different guys are specializing in different disciplines."" ""To be able to do that in three very different disciplines is a tremendous feat and definitely the biggest achievement of my career."" In the period since he became ""The King of Schladming,"" Ligety has gone on to secure Giant Slalom Olympic gold in Sochi (to add to the Super Combined gold he won in Turin 2006) and the fifth World Cup crystal globe of his career in 2014 for the same discipline. Yet he's far from had it all his own way. ""The Shred"" finished way back in 12th and 14th position in the Super Combined and Super G events in Sochi respectively. And he currently lies in 12th position in this year's overall World Cup standings, way off the impressive pace set by Austria's Marcel Hirscher. Hirscher has won the overall title for the past three years and is heavily fancied in the giant slalom at Beaver Creek. Other challengers include the in-form Kjetil Jansrud of Norway who has won three downhill events this season and picked up Super G gold in Sochi last year. The likes of Alexis Pinturault, Hans Reichelt and Dominik Paris will also fancy their chances of tearing up Ligety's dream script. But Ligety feels the intricacies of the Birds of Prey course could help play into his hands. ""(The course) is really great in every discipline and downhill it's probably the most fun course around,"" he said, adding that ""the Super G hill is really good for me ... in giant slalom I've had a tonne of success there over the last five years."" Having the backing of an enthusiastic home crowd will also doubtless help. ""I've always liked racing in the US,"" he said. ""I think it's kind of an understated disadvantage for North Americans in general having to race World Cups which are generally in Central Europe."" ""So it's nice to be able to take those Euros out of their element and make them live out of their duffel bags for a couple of weeks and experience the travel side of things."" With the likes of Steven Nyman and Travis Ganong on form and Lindsey Vonn back after a lengthy injury layoff, hopes are high for the U.S. contingent. Some have even suggested this could be the strongest U.S. side ever going into a World Championship. ""We've got an amazing team right now,"" Ligety said. ""I think we have a really good chance to get some medals on the downhill side of things and on Super G ... (there's) myself and Andrew Weibrecht. ""On the women's side you have Lindsey (Vonn) who's already dominating again which is pretty incredible. Mikaela (Shiffrin), who's found her stride again in the middle of this year, is dominating ... and winning Giant Slalom as well. ""So I think we have a lot of different athletes on both the men's and the women's side that could win a lot of medals."" Ligety reserves particular praise for Vonn who broke the record for all-time career wins with her 62nd World Cup triumph late last month. ""I think most of us are so taken aback by how fast she came back from having a two-year break,"" he said. ""Being able to dominate so quickly, I think that's the biggest thing we're surprised about. ""I think none of us are surprised that she's won (now 64) World Cups or something because that was kind of an inevitability I think in a lot of our minds. (But) that's cool that she's able to achieve that for sure."" Away from the slopes Ligety has been kept busy building his own Shred brand of ski clothing and equipment in recent years. He describes it as a fusion of the best technical and most stylish gear on the market. So successful has the venture been that some of his biggest rivals on the slopes, like Alexis Pinero and Carlo Janka, have even been spotted using Shred goggles. But the stresses of the business world will be way to the back of Ligety's mind when race time arrives over the coming weeks. Of more concern will be winning and making the most of the unique set up of the World Championship event. ""I think the World Championships is awesome because there's so few races we're racing men and women together so it's kind of cool to be able to feed off that energy. ""Normally we'll have a giant slalom and a slalom one place and then you have to ... get in your car and drive a couple of hours and then you go do a downhill and a Super G the next weekend. ""It's nice to be able to do everything all in one place. The World Championships, like you said, it's second Olympics. It's really cool to have those races that really mean a lot and then to be able to do it in the United States is a huge opportunity for us.""","Ted Ligety  eyes World Championship success at Beaver Creek .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN)ISIS militants have attacked Kirkuk in northern Iraq, an effort that might be an earnest attempt to capture the key oil-rich city or perhaps to divert Kurdish troops fighting to capture the Islamist extremist group's stronghold of Mosul. For months, ISIS has been facing off with the Peshmerga --  armed fighters who protect Iraqi Kurdistan -- to the west of Kirkuk. It had gone into areas on Kirkuk's outskirts, but not the central city. Until now, apparently. Heavily armed militants attacked an abandoned hotel in central Kirkuk that local police had used as their headquarters. Peshmerga and Kurdish anti-terror units later raided the hotel, wresting control of it from the militants and killing three of them, according to Peshmerga sources. In addition, two suicide bombers detonated themselves in an attempt to keep the Kurdish forces out. Also Friday, ISIS militants took over Maktab Khalid, an area about 12 miles southwest of Kirkuk, after heavy clashes with the Peshmerga. Among those killed was Brig. Gen. Shirko Fateh, the highest-ranking operational commander of the Peshmerga brigade located in Kirkuk. Photos posted by ISIS purportedly show the group's militants in control of parts of south and southwest Kirkuk, burning tents that had been used by Peshmerga troops. The U.S. military said Friday that an ISIS chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike late last week. Abu Malik worked in Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons program before joining al Qaeda in 2005, U.S. Central Command said. He was killed January 24 near Mosul. ""His death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish (ISIS') ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people,"" the military said. There is no public evidence that ISIS has a dedicated weapons of mass destruction program. But U.S. Central Command said: ""His past training and experience provided the terrorist group with expertise to pursue a chemical weapons capability."" Kirkuk is a strategically important city in the months-long fight, one that has pitted ISIS against the Peshmerga, Iraqi government troops and an international coalition that has carried out airstrikes against the terrorist group. It is one of the few notable cities -- apart from the region of Kurdistan and its capital, Irbil -- in northern Iraq that haven't fallen to ISIS. Part of its significance stems from the fact its oil reserves are almost as much as those in southern Iraq. The Kurds and the central Iraqi government in Baghdad have long wrangled over control of those reserves, with each side wanting to keep hold of them. ISIS, which relies heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations, has been coveting them, too. Peshmerga forces took over the Kirkuk area in June when the Iraqi army crumbled in the face of ISIS' advances and have played a vital role in defending it from ISIS since. In December, ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack there that killed at least 17 people and injured more than 20. The attack, according to ISIS, was meant to send a message to the Kurdish people and Peshmerga fighters. Still, Kirkuk is hardly the only place that has seen recent fighting -- which may be part of ISIS' rationale for Friday's attack there. The group has been fending off an offensive from Peshmerga fighters around Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict, that has left the Sunni extremist group on its heels. The city of 1.5 million people on the Tigris River has been held by ISIS since June. ISIS has invested heavily in governing the city. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the Grand Mosque there in July. Kurdish officials say that as long as ISIS holds Mosul, it threatens Kurdistan. Likewise, neither the government in Baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy Iraq's second-largest city. Peshmerga forces have made steady progress against ISIS north and west of Mosul over the past two months. They have taken some 3,000 square kilometers (1,160 square miles) of the Sinjar area, as well as the area around the Mosul Dam, choking off access routes and threatening ISIS' main resupply routes. There's little doubt, though, that ISIS remains a very real force, and threat, in much of Iraq. The group, which calls itself the Islamic State, still controls a vast swath of that Middle Eastern nation and neighboring Syria. Its goal is to have a vast caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law, with its followers proving they will stop at nothing -- having been blamed for the large-scale killings of civilians, mass kidnappings and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves -- during its quest. That violent campaign continued Friday, and not just in Kirkuk. Dozens of gunmen believed to be from ISIS faced off Friday morning about 175 miles (285 kilometers) away in central Ramadi, police and health officials in that city said. Several hours later, that onslaught had been foiled and 20 gunmen were dead, according to the officials. Elsewhere in Ramadi, a suicide car bomb explosion at an Iraqi army checkpoint killed one soldier and wounded six others. Violence flared in other parts of Iraq as well that, while it hasn't been tied to ISIS, is further proof of the country's unsettled state. Six explosions went off Friday around Baghdad, leaving at least seven dead and 23 wounded, according to police officials. The deadliest such blast was in Bab Al Sharji, a busy commercial area in central Baghdad, leaving three dead and 10 hurt. Hope fades for ISIS captives as deadline passes .

"(CNN)For ISIS it is a new dynamic, experts say: demanding high value prisoners in exchange for hostages. Three of the prisoners ISIS apparently wants back are women -- a failed suicide bomber, an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of ISIS. The fourth is a child. Many countries have a strategy of not negotiating with terrorists. But this new approach by ISIS is putting governments to the test. In its most recent demand, ISIS called for Sajida al-Rishawi to be handed over. She is a female Jihadi imprisoned for her role in a 2005 suicide bombing at a wedding reception in Jordan that killed dozens. If she wasn't brought to the Turkish border by sunset Thursday, the militants said, two hostages would die: Japanese journalist Kenji Goto and Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh. The deadline has passed but the hostages' fate is unknown. ""By negotiating with ISIS, by recognizing them, by even having dialogue with them, it gives them the impression of acting as a state,"" said Sajjan Gohel, international security director at the Asia Pacific Foundation. Jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al-Rishawi for the pilot. But they have demanded ""proof of life"" to demonstrate that al-Kassasbeh, captured in December after his fighter jet crashed in Syria, is still alive. Former FBI negotiator Chris Voss said Jordan was absolutely right to do so -- and that the failure of ISIS so far to provide proof of life was suspicious. ""It's just a natural and ordinary course of bargains in these types of negotiations and they are choosing not to do that at this point,"" he said. The latest proposal by ISIS is not a prisoner exchange in the usual sense -- since the militants now want the release of al-Rishawi just in order not to kill the two hostages, rather than promising their release. Voss said entering into this kind of territory with terrorists was dangerous . ""If you engage in that sort of bargain then they can threaten to kill the same person over and over and over again -- and continue to demand release of hostages or whatever their demands are,"" he said. ""You can't give in to that sort of thing because then it puts you in an endless loop where they have all the power."" It's important to remember that for ISIS and groups like them, the key factor is gain, Voss said. ""Kidnappers are in a commodities exchange business. While it's a horrifying concept to us, to them it's business -- and it's the business ISIS is in and so you have to treat it like that."" Besides failed suicide bomber al-Rishawi, ISIS wants two other women -- an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of ISIS -- and a child. Each of the prisoners is symbolically and strategically important for the terror group. Al-Rishawi is connected to ISIS through her brother, once a ranking member of al Qaeda in Iraq, which spawned ISIS. In exchange for American journalists James Foley and, later, Steven Sotloff -- ISIS demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, nicknamed ""Lady Al-Qaeda"" -- an imprisoned neuroscientist in the United States, linked to 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. She was arrested in Afghanistan in 2008 carrying bomb-making documents for a ""mass casualty"" chemical and biological weapons attack against American targets including the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge. One high profile prisoner who ISIS has not yet publicly demanded is Saja al-Dulaimi. She may be the wife of shadowy-ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, who fought with al Qaeda in Iraq, though the Iraqi Interior Ministry has disputed that. Regional sources have told CNN that al-Dulaimi is herself a powerful ISIS figure, arrested as a high value target as she crossed into Lebanon with a four-year old child, whom one intelligence source identified as Baghdadi's son. Since their capture in March 2014, Baghdadi has been calling to get his child released, a regional source said. In the past, in similar cases, governments have budged. Last year, the United States traded several Taliban captives for Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was captured by the extremist group almost five years earlier. Despite claims that Bergdahl may have abandoned his post before being kidnapped, the State Department defended the move, saying it was nothing unusual. ""It is consistent absolutely with what's happened in previous wars -- including Korea, including Vietnam,"" said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf, adding that there was ""a long history in the United States of prisoner swaps."" Complicating the debate, one of the five Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in return for Bergdahl last May has attempted to return to militant activity from his current location in Qatar by making contact with suspected Taliban associates in Afghanistan, multiple officials told CNN on Thursday. During the Cold War, the West also swapped hundreds of spies with Communist bloc countries. But prisoner swaps with extremist groups remain controversial. In 2011, Israel made a major made a major concession to its arch enemy, the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which runs Gaza. It exchanged more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in return for the soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been kidnapped in Gaza in 2006. Hamas celebrated the deal as a major victory and the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was heavily criticized. Duncan Bullivant, a UK-based risk consultant, says swapping prisoners for hostages is still better than paying for release of prisoners, as some European countries do. ""The payment of cash ransom can been seen as the direct funding of terrorist organizations and for that reason and a few others, is regarded as unacceptable certainly by the U.S., UK and increasingly other nations,"" he said. ""There would be nothing unusual about the swapping of combatants and if the Japanese victim is thrown in as part of the deal, then that is a great bonus."" It's sadly far from certain that Goto and al-Kassasbeh will emerge from the current negotiations alive. But whether they gain the release of al-Rishawi or not, ISIS' leaders have very clearly achieved one goal: maximum media coverage for their cause. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","ISIS wants release of high profile female prisoners in exchange for hostages' lives .

"Bosnia-Herzegovina made history Tuesday after qualifying for the World Cup for the first time in the nation's history. Vedad Ibisevic's strike gave his country a 1-0 win over Lithuania in Kaunas to ensure his team will compete at next year's tournament in Brazil. It was in 1995 that Bosnia played its first match as an independent nation following the break up of Yugoslavia. Twice it has come close to reaching major tournaments, losing out to Portugal on both occasions in the 2010 World Cup and 2012 European Championship playoffs. ""I congratulate these guys for their great work in the last four years, and it would have been real injustice if we had failed to win the group and qualify for the World Cup,"" coach Safet Susic told Bosnia media. The victory sparked wild scenes of jubilation in Sarajevo where fans celebrated with fireworks and chanting following the result. Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko said: ""I wish to send my regards to Brazil and say that we will show how mighty Bosnia is."" Elsewhere, England booked its place in Brazil with an impressive 2-0 victory over Poland at Wembley. Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard were both on target in an entertaining affair. It means Ukraine will have to negotiate the playoffs with England able to relax -- much to the relief of manager Roy Hodgson. ""I'm greatly satisfied,"" Hodgson told ITV. ""It was a tough group, both Montenegro and Poland showed themselves to be great opponents both home and away. ""We played some sensational football in the first half and we dug in very well and controlled them in the second. ""We always said that if we could get to the last two games, we'd be stronger and have players coming back. ""We've found a winger in Andros Townsend who looks as though he's been playing there (international football) all his life. He's going to be under a lot of pressure now but he's a level headed young man and he'll deal with it. ""We've been working together for 18 months and the way we play has changed. We're getting better all the time and hopefully will get better still. The players really are a group and they trust each other."" Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick was given a place in the starting line up in place of Frank Lampard and played a key role in his side's success. ""We did everything we wanted to in the first half. Second half, they came out and created chances straight away,"" he told the BBC. ""We stayed strong and saw it through. At 1-0, sometimes you get caught in between getting another goal and holding on. ""We set out to qualify, we are not getting over-excited. It is what we expected of ourselves, hopefully it is the shape of things to come. ""We have set standards, and at times we have not lived up to them. We are unbeaten throughout the campaign. ""The World Cup is still a long way off, with a lot of football to be played. The competition in midfield is tough."" Spain topped Group I following a 2-0 win over Georgia thanks to goals from Alvaro Negredo and Juan Mata. That result means France must now enter the playoffs despite its 3-0 win over Finland. France will not be seeded for the playoffs and could face Ukraine, Greece, Croatia or Portugal. Romania will also be in the mix after taking second place in Group D. Romania saw off Estonia 2-0 and benefited from Turkey's home defeat by a Netherlands side which had already qualified. Meanwhile, Iceland booked its place in the playoffs following a 1-1 draw in Norway. Kolbeinn Sigþórsson gave the visiting side the lead and although Norway did equalize, it could not prevent Iceland from finishing second in Group E. Only Slovenia could have prevented Iceland from finishing second but it succumbed to a 1-0 defeat in Switzerland. Russia qualified following a 1-1 draw in Azerbaijan meaning that Portugal's 3-0 win over Luxembourg was superfluous. In the night's other games, Croatia was beaten 2-0 in Scotland, Belgium was held to a 1-1 draw by Wales and Germany edged out Sweden 5-3 in a thrilling contest. In Africa, Ghana took a giant stride towards the World Cup following a crushing 6-1 win over Egypt in the first leg of its playoff tie. Asamoah Gyan scored twice, while further strikes from Abdul Majeed Waris, Sulley Muntari, Christian Atsu and an own-goal sealed the win.","Bosnia-Herzegovina reaches World Cup finals for first time in country's history .

"In a sign of the political hangover congressional Republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown, three-quarters of Americans in a new national poll say that most GOP members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected. A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans' policies are too extreme. And according to the poll, Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections, there's plenty of time for these numbers to change. CNN Poll: House Republicans, Boehner take big post-shutdown hit . The poll was conducted Friday through Sunday, just after the end of the 16-day partial federal government shutdown that was sparked in part by an effort by House conservatives to dismantle the health care law, which is President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. A majority of those questioned blamed congressional Republicans for the government shutdown and said the President was the bigger winner in the deal to end the crisis. The survey also found nearly eight in 10 saying the shutdown was bad for the country, and the standoff has led to a loss of confidence and satisfaction in government. And more than seven in 10 think that another shutdown is likely. Anger directed at congressional Republicans . More than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected, with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative doesn't deserve a return ticket to Washington next year. Both figures are hovering around all-time highs in CNN polling. ""Although incumbent members of Congress of both parties are not very popular, the shutdown seems to have only affected views of GOP incumbents,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Defeated GOP hopes to unite, fight another day . Three-fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional Republicans don't deserved to be re-elected, 21 percentage points higher than the 54% who say most Democrats don't deserve another term in office. Only one in five say most Republicans deserve to be re-elected; 42% say the same thing about Democrats on Capitol Hill. Democrats hold early 2014 polling lead . The shutdown seems to be making an impact on polls asking the generic ballot question: Would you vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate in your congressional district. There is no mention of the names of any candidates. Fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the Democrat in their district, with 42% backing the Republican. The 8-point Democratic margin in the CNN poll is the same as in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and close to the 9-point advantage for the Democrats in the generic ballot in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. While the generic ballot is a much-watched gauge, it's important to remember that the battle for the House is a district-by-district fight, rather than a national race, and just 17 of the 232 House Republicans are in districts won by Obama in last year's election. Obama wants new approach after shutdown . ""We're a long way away from saying that the Democrats have a chance to regain control of the House,"" Holland cautioned. ""There is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections. A year before the 2010 midterms, for example, the Democrats held a 6-point lead on the generic ballot."" The Republicans eventually won back control of the House in 2010, thanks to a historic 63-seat pickup. PDF: Read the entire poll | Satisfied? GOP too extreme? One major concern for Republicans is the growing number of Americans who think the party is too extreme. Fifty-six percent now feel that way, up from 48% in March. By contrast, 52% say that the policies of the Democrats are generally mainstream (with 42% saying they are too extreme), which is unchanged since March. ""Any connection with the tea party movement isn't helping the GOP,"" Holland added. ""Six in 10 Americans now believe that the tea party movement is too extreme; only one in four consider it to be generally mainstream."" The poll indicates that Republicans themselves are divided on whether the 4 1/2-year-old grassroots conservative movement is too extreme or generally mainstream. Four things we learned from government shutdown . Blame Game . Fifty-two percent say congressional Republicans were more responsible for the shutdown, with 34% pointing more fingers at the President. At 45%-36%, independents place more blame with the GOP in Congress. The poll indicates Obama was the clear winner. Sixty-four percent say the President got more of what he wanted out of the deal to end the shutdown, with less than one in five saying the GOP in Congress were the winners. More than seven in 10 Republicans and conservatives agree that Obama got more of what he wanted. Fifty-five percent of the public say the GOP strategy to link dismantling parts of Obamacare to funding the government was a mistake, with 42% saying it made sense at the time. While vast majority of Democrats say the strategy was a mistake, independents are divided, and most Republicans say the move made sense. The next shutdown ? While the GOP doesn't fare well in the poll, the poll suggests that the public is looking for almost as much compromise from the Democrats as from the Republicans in any bipartisan agreements. Forty-nine percent say the Republicans should give up more than the Democrats in any future bipartisan agreement, but nearly as many -- 44% -- would prefer to see the Dems give up more than the GOP. And seven in 10 say that another shutdown is likely when current funding for the federal government runs out in mid-January. ""That's probably because Americans have lost confidence in the people who run government,"" Holland said. According to the poll, only a third say they have a great deal or some confidence in the people who run government, down 10 points since May.  And only 14% say they are satisfied with the way the nation is being governed. ""That's an 11-point drop since March and is lower than the 26% who felt that way in September of 1973, when the Watergate crisis was in full swing,"" Holland added. In another sign of anti-Washington sentiment, six in 10 say the government should not do more to solve the country's problems. he poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International October 18-20, with 841 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.","CNN poll finds significantly more feel that Republicans should be voted out .

"Washington (CNN)The Republican Senate takeover is a hot conversation topic in Washington, but outside the nation's capital, Americans aren't feeling much of a change as the new Congress gavels into session on Tuesday. About 6-in-10 Americans believe the new Congress won't get more done compared to the previous Congress, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday.  And about half of Americans surveyed said they don't expect Congress to be more or less responsive this time around. On the flip side, 37% of Americans have faith the new Congress will get more done than the last and just 30% of Americans think Congress will be more responsive to the public in the new session. Republicans swept the midterm elections, gaining control of the Senate and keeping control of the House of Representatives. But that doesn't mean Americans are confident the GOP will do a better job running the Senate. RELATED: Read the entire CNN/ORC poll results . Just 28% of Americans think the Senate will be better off with Republicans wielding the gavel and controlling the flow of legislation to the Senate floor. And 24% think Republicans will do a worse job. And in a CNN/ORC poll published last month, half of Americans predicted Republican control of both houses of Congress will be bad news for the country -- with most saying it will cause more gridlock in Washington. Obama, in his final two years in office, will face off with a Republican majority in Congress for the first time of his presidency. But on the whole, Americans are now just feeling apathetic to the change in power: 46% said there won't be much difference in how the Senate runs. The public has some partisan woes of its own, with the 1,011 Americans polled split down the middle on whether Republicans or Democrats should make more concessions to pass bipartisan legislation. Those compromises are sparse on Capitol Hill, and respondents spread the blame on both parties, though slightly more pinned the lack of cooperation on Republicans. Americans' low expectations for Congress are nothing new: a whopping 83% of Americans said they disapproved of how Congress was handling its job in a September CNN/ORC poll. Those surveyed in the CNN/ORC poll released on Tuesday also sounded off on the role of government. Their message? Less government and less focus on values. The government is trying to doing too much that businesses and individual should handle, 58% of Americans surveyed said. And 55% said the government shouldn't be in the business of promoting traditional values -- or any values, at all.","6-in-10 Americans don't think the new Congress will get more done than the last .

"Washington  (CNN)Defying a presidential veto threat, the House of Representatives passed a bill approving the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The vote was 266-153, with more than two dozen Democrats joining nearly all Republicans to pass the measure. It was the first time the legislation passed in the new session of Congress which began Tuesday, but the tenth time the GOP-controlled House has sent a bill approving the pipeline to the Senate. Rep. Justin Amash, of Michigan, was the only Republican to vote ""present,"" and 28 Democrats voted to approve the measure. Congressional Republicans have made the pipeline one of their first priorities in the new session, arguing it would created tens of thousands of jobs, and pointing out the measure has received Democratic support.  A Senate committee passed its Keystone legislation on Thursday, and the bill is scheduled for a vote later this month.  Senate GOP leaders are confident they have enough votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster on the bill, but they do not believe they can sustain a veto. The White House says it's waiting on the State Department to review a new court ruling that effectively removes a major block to the building of the Keystone XL pipeline. ""The State Department is examining the court's decision as part of its process to evaluate whether the Keystone XL Pipeline project serves the national interest. As we have made clear, we are going to let that process play out,"" Eric Schultz, White House principal deputy press secretary, said Friday. His statement comes after the Nebraska Supreme Court vacated a lower court ruling that was stalling construction of the pipeline, which would run through several states and carry oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Read the ruling . President Barack Obama has said he was awaiting final word by the Nebraska court before determining whether to grant TransCanada, the firm building the pipeline, a presidential permit to move forward with remaining construction. The decision reverses a lower court decision that had ruled the pipeline unconstitutional. While a majority of the court's seven justices sided with landowners who were fighting Gov. Dave Heineman's plans to OK the pipeline's construction, a super majority of five justices were needed in order to rule his decision unconstitutional and block the pipeline's development. Keystone XL pipeline debate: What do I need to know? Opponents say the pipeline would run a significant risk to the environment, while proponents argue it will boost jobs and lessen American dependence on Middle Eastern oil. The State Department earlier this year released a long-anticipated report saying the completion of the pipeline would have little impact on carbon emissions. ""President Obama is now out of excuses for blocking the Keystone pipeline and the thousands of American jobs it would create.  Finally, it's time to start building,"" House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. Schultz reiterated that Obama would veto the House bill, saying it ""conflicts with longstanding Executive branch procedures regarding the authority of the President and prevents the thorough consideration of complex issues that could bear on U.S. national interests. With Republicans now in control of the Senate, they've pledged to make the issue a priority in the new Congress. The Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to complete the project on Thursday, and a procedural vote is expected on the measure Monday in the full Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Obama Friday in a statement to reconsider his veto threat and said the Senate would soon pass a proposal to approve the project. ""The president now has every reason to sign it,"" McConnell said. Obama on Keystone: 'My position hasn't changed' TransCanada is waiting for U.S. approval to finish construction on 1,200 miles of pipeline known as Keystone XL, which would complete a partially built pipeline network that runs 3,800 miles. The incomplete part of the pipeline would run through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. CNN's Ted Barrett, Joe Johns, Jedd Rosche and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.","The House approved a measure approving the Keystone pipeline with a vote 266-153 .

"Singer Chris Brown and a bodyguard were arrested Sunday morning and charged with felony assault, the Washington Metropolitan Police Department said. The arrest could have serious legal consequence for Brown, 24, since he is serving probation for the felony domestic violence conviction relating to his 2009 attack on former girlfriend Rihanna. Brown and bodyguard Christopher Hollosy allegedly attacked a man with their fists outside the W Hotel in downtown Washington at 4:25 a.m. Sunday, police said. The police incident report obtained by CNN identified the alleged victim as Isaac Adams Parker, 20, of Beltsville, Maryland. Parker did not immediately respond to a CNN call for comment. Parker told police that he tried to jump into a photo that Brown was posing for with a female fan on the sidewalk when the singer said, ""I'm not down with that gay s--t"" and ""I feel like boxing,"" the police report said. Parker said that Brown then punched him in the face with his closed fist, the report said. Parker said Brown's bodyguard -- who stands 6-foot-5 and weighs 240 pounds -- stepped between them and punched Parker in the face, the report said.  The bodyguard then grabbed Brown by his arm and pulled him toward his tour bus, which was parked near by, it said. Brown and the bodyguard were taken into custody and were being held at the Second District police station, police said. Both men were later transferred to a central jail cell block for processing, police said, . Parker was treated and released at a hospital for treatment for a bruised and swollen face, police spokesman Anthony Clay told CNN. Brown was in Washington to host a ""homecoming party"" at The Park at Fourteen nightclub Saturday night, according to his Twitter feed, just four blocks away from where he was arrested Sunday morning. His representative and lawyer did not immediately respond to CNN calls for comment Sunday. Brown is on probation in California for a felony domestic violence conviction involving Rihanna.  Any arrest could be considered a violation of that probation, which could result in jail time. Prosecutors filed probation violation charges against him twice in the past year, resulting in the judge ordering him to complete an additional 1,000 hours of community service. In August: Brown ordered to 1,000 hours community labor . Brown was arrested in February 2009 for punching Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. The altercation left the face of Rihanna, also a chart-topping singer, bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards. He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years probation and ordered to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service."" His probation reports were glowing until the past year, when the district attorney's office accused him of not completing the 1,400 hours of community labor, which he was allowed to do in his home state of Virginia. Brown calls out Jay-Z in new interview . He was also accused of hit-and-run after a minor traffic crash earlier this year. The driver of the other car told investigators that Brown ""went ballistic"" and screamed at her after his Range Rover rear-ended her Mercedes on a Los Angeles street. In August, Brown's lawyer reached a settlement with prosecutors to end their efforts to revoke his probation. The deal called for Brown to complete another 1,000 hours of community service. Probation rules require Brown to stay out of all legal trouble. Even an arrest that does not lead to a conviction could result in a probation violation charge. He is scheduled to appear before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin on November 20 for a probation status hearing.

"The bitter fight over nominations resumes Thursday as Senate Republicans appear poised to try and block two of President Obama's appointments, possibly triggering an angry backlash from Democrats. One is the President's pick to be a judge on the highly influential U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.   The other is a Democratic congressman the President wants to head the federal agency that oversees the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If Republicans succeed in blocking the two, Democrats might carry out a threat to change Senate rules over GOP objections, the so-called ""nuclear option,"" to prevent future filibusters of presidential appointees. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Wednesday he was ""cautiously optimistic"" Republicans would approve Patricia Millett to the appeals court, which is often considered second in importance to the Supreme Court.  He declined to ""get into hypotheticals"" before the votes take place about whether he'd push for the rules changes. Republican aides were doubtful  -- although not fully confident -- that at least five GOP senators would break with their party to support Millett.  They said Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska might vote with Democrats to break the filibuster. If they did, that would still leave Democrats three votes shy of the 60 needed to break the filibuster. Senior Democratic aides seemed genuinely unsure of whether they would have enough votes to move Millett's nomination, unusual on the eve of a key vote. Since Millett was chosen a few weeks ago, Republicans have said Democrats and the President are trying to change the balance on the court, which currently has four judges who were appointed by Democratic presidents and four judges who were appointed by Republican presidents. While there are currently three vacancies on the 11 seat bench, Republicans argue its workload is lighter than some other circuits and they would like to see vacancies filled elsewhere first. ""I think we're not going to allow that court to be stacked,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.  ""She'd be a fine judge, just put her somewhere else."" ""It's clear they are trying to pack the court so they can have their judges pass legislation they can never get through the Congress,"" said Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Utah.  ""I don't think Republicans are going to roll over on this."" Democrats argue the Republican effort to block Millett is a transparent attempt to preserve conservative influence on the appeals court. ""If this goes down, it's just politics,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who is pushing for Millett's confirmation.  ""This woman is superbly qualified."" Reid has been frustrated for years about Republicans slow-walking nominations and in the past has threatened the rules change, which Republicans warn would destroy cooperation in the chamber.   But he's held back despite pressure from many members and liberal interest groups to implement the controversial new rules that would allow approval of nominees with just a 51-vote majority. ""The pressure to change the rules will be almost insurmountable"" if Republicans block Millett, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, who chairs the Judiciary Committee said Tuesday. One top Republican leadership aide said he doubted Reid would change the rules.  The aide said Reid also is under pressure to preserve the ability of Democrats to filibuster the nominees of future Republican presidents and he wouldn't want to throw that away over this appointment. The fight over Millett comes as part of a broader Democratic push this week on a series of Obama appointments.  So far each of the executive branch nominees has been approved.  But now there are doubts about Millett and Rep. Mel Watt, D-North Carolina, who the President picked to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the controversial mortgage entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.   Republicans have argued Watt is not independent enough and lacks the expertise to manage the complex agency. Democratic Senate aides conceded privately that is unlikely Watt will get the 60 votes he needs for confirmation. One aide said if both Millett and Watt are defeated, rank and file Democratic senators would be more likely to push for the nuclear option, something Democratic leaders had not initially envisioned would be the result of this week's voting.","Confirmation particularly unclear for two presidential nominees .

"Chaos erupted after the first student was shot. Children ran screaming and crying. Almost everyone on the playground sprinted away from the boy who had just fired a pistol at his schoolmate. Not Michael Landsberry. The 45-year-old math teacher calmly walked toward the gunman as he crossed the basketball court. Landsberry raised his hands to show he was no threat. He tried to reason with the boy. A student who witnessed the shooting said Landsberry was trying to make the shooter put his weapon down. He did not. ""He took the shot right then and there,"" the witness said. The entire tragedy unfolded in a mere three minutes. A popular teacher, coach and member of the Nevada Air National Guard lay dead. His students and fellow guardsmen were stunned by his devastating death, but no one was surprised by how, directly in the face of danger, he tried to solve the crisis. ""That was the kind of person that Michael was,"" his brother, Reggie Landsberry, said. ""He was the kind of person that if somebody needed help he would be there."" Col. Jeffrey Burkett, commander of the Nevada Air Guard's 152nd Airlift Wing, said he liked to think that Michael Landsberry -- who had been deployed once to a busy base in Afghanistan -- was using his military training when he confronted the shooter. ""He was trying to save the children. He was trying to save that child,"" Burkett said. That child, the 12-year-old shooter, later turned the 9 mm pistol on himself.  His identity has not been released. Landsberry couldn't save the shooter or himself, but he did delay the gunman from going immediately after more victims. ""Mr. Landsberry's heroic actions, by stepping toward the shooter, allowed time for other students in the playground area to flee,"" Washoe County School District Police Chief Mike Mieras said. Beloved teacher slain by 'nice kid' As news of the shooting was reported on Twitter, students and former students tweeted about Mr. Landsberry, who taught eighth-grade math. He can't be dead, they wrote to each other. He's strong, he'll make it, one said. Soon the ugly realization came that he was gone. He leaves a wife and two stepdaughters. His wife, Sharon, posted a note on Facebook, thanking her friends for their condolences. ""He was My Everything, My World!! He has touched so many lives and was an incredible Man!!,"" she wrote Monday night. Landsberry, who joined the Marines after he graduated from high school in Reno in 1986, had an associate's degree in law enforcement and a bachelor's degree in education, according to a statement from the Guard. He began teaching in 2001, the same year he enlisted in the Guard, the statement said. He worked at two other schools before moving to Sparks Middle School in 2006. In addition to being a math teacher he also coached basketball, cross country, track  and volleyball, as well as girls soccer at Sparks High School, the Guard said. Reggie Landsberry said caring for others was something he and his brother learned from their father, who served in the Marines for 22 years. Michael Landsberry, also a veteran of the Corps, was ""just a good all-around individual,"" his brother said. The colonel said Landsberry ""was close to a lot of people out here on the base."" A Facebook memorial page posted in Landsberry's honor had more than 16,100 likes on Tuesday afternoon. Among the comments: . ""Once a hero, always a hero! RIP."" ""God bless you for the greatest act of courage and love."" ""From one Air Force vet to a USMC vet, I salute you. Rest in peace, brother."" Thousands more honored the slain teacher on a ""Rest Easy Mr. Landsberry"" page. On a website for his students, ""Mr. Landsberry's Math Class,"" the slain teacher had posted pictures of himself hiking in the wilderness and standing with a weapon beside an armored vehicle. ""One of my goals is to earn your respect while you earn mine,"" he wrote in a message to students. ""I believe that with mutual respect that the classroom environment will run smoothly."" Sparks Mayor Geno Martini called the loss of Landsberry ""devastating."" ""It's very unfortunate that (the life of) someone like that, who protected our country over there and came back alive ... had to be taken at his work, at a school,"" Martini said. Landsberry attained the rank of corporal and served as a field wireman, Marine spokeswoman Maj. Shawn Haney said. The Guard said he was a master sergeant, who was also once deployed to Kuwait. ""A lot of lives saved by this Marine. May he guard the gates of heaven. Semper Fi, Sir,"" one commenter wrote on Facebook, referencing the ""Always Faithful"" motto of the Marines.","Wife writes on Facebook: ""He was My Everything, My World!""

"As accusations over Obamacare and U.S. spying spiral into political controversies at home and abroad, there are two key questions bubbling beneath the surface: What did President Obama know, and when did he find out? U.S. officials have said that the President didn't know about problems with the website for the health care policy he championed and that it wasn't until recently that he learned about a National Security Agency operation that wiretapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, became the latest official to say the President was unaware of at least some spying. ""It is my understanding that President Obama was not aware Chancellor Merkel's communications were being collected since 2002. That is a big problem,"" she said Monday in a written statement. Questions about what the President knew and when he knew it have important implications, analysts told CNN on Monday. If Obama was aware, that could mean he isn't being clear with the American public now. And if he wasn't aware, that could mean his own staff kept him in the dark. ""There's really no good answer,"" said Republican strategist Kevin Madden. ""If he knew, essentially we're being misled by different people in the administration about the extent of the president's knowledge. If he didn't know, it's an abdication of even the most basic responsibilities of the command and control over very important parts of his administration, and that becomes a problem."" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, said this isn't the first time this sort of situation has come up, and someone aiming to protect Obama could have deliberately kept him out of the loop. ""So he gets to sort of exonerate himself and say, 'I really don't know.' ....But if he's not responsible, who is?"" she told CNN's The Lead.  ""He has to be accountable for major decisions and major moments like this. When someone like Merkel calls him, he has to be able to be accountable to her and say these aren't decisions made by other people."" White House: Don't tie issues together . In an exclusive interview with CNN last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the President didn't know of problems with the Affordable Care Act's website until after its glitch-laden launch on Oct. 1. This was despite the fact that insurance companies had been complaining and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run. At a press briefing Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to detail what Obama knew and when. He said that tying topics like problems with the Obamacare website and reports about NSA spying together is ""conflating a bunch of very disparate issues."" Asked about a Wall Street Journal report that the White House stopped the operation monitoring Merkel after learning about it over the summer, Carney said he wouldn't ""get into individual reports about specific programs"" but said he'd provide more details once a White House review of U.S. surveillance is complete. Experts: Not every detail disclosed . It's plausible that Obama wouldn't know about specific surveillance targets, said CNN National Security Analyst Frances Fragos Townsend, who sits on the CIA external advisory board. Overall intelligence collection priorities are well-known by the White House, she said. ""Specific targets, however, (like) Angela Merkel's cell phone, are not the sort of thing discussed with the President of the United States,"" she said. Every morning, Townsend said, Obama receives an intelligence narrative. ""It doesn't tell him specifically where the collection came from,"" Townsend said, ""but some of it is sort of self-evident."" No one should expect the President to know everything the NSA is doing, said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. ""But when you're talking about the surveillance of world leaders, and an issue that's been controversial for a while now, you would expect that there's some knowledge either by the President or people surrounding him. ... I do think there's surprise that this was off the radar in the inner circles of the White House,"" he said. Time for change? Republican U.S. Rep. Peter King, a key member of the Homeland Security Committee, said if the surveillance happened without the President's knowledge, it has larger implications. ""I would say if the President did not know, that raises very serious questions about what he's doing as chief executive. The fact he would be going into negotiations and discussions and meetings with Angela Merkel or French leaders -- or any leaders for that matter -- and not be aware that there was surveillance going on of the private phone calls, to me either something is definitely wrong in his administration or he just has a totally hands-off attitude. To me, this is unacceptable,"" King told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday. No matter what Obama knew, or when, Stoddard said, it's time for a new approach. ""He has often said that he didn't know what was going on with the (HealthCare.gov) website. ... He can't pretend he doesn't know and walk away from problems anymore, because he has been caught too many times out of the loop,"" she said. ""He can't do his job that way."" Problems in management, analysts say . Ron Suskind, who analyzed Obama's leadership style in his book ""Confidence Men,"" said the recent glitches in HealthCare.gov give a glimpse into problems with Obama's management approach. Obama should get high marks for the concepts of policies he's pushed forward, like the Affordable Care Act, Suskind said. But he's struggled with implementing them, Suskind said. ""Whether Obama gave orders that were not followed, or simply did not give directives that were precise with attached ticking clocks, if you will, in terms of execution, he clearly should have, minutes after the Affordable Care Act was passed, said, 'This is a logistically high bar to cross. Let us begin now to come up with models, alphas and betas and test runs, and call in the best people on the planet to make sure that we have a system that is ready to operate efficiently on opening day.'"" But when Obama learned of the problems isn't the most important question to ask, Suskind said. ""The question is, what will he do now?"" Ross Douthat, a CNN political commentator and a columnist for The New York Times, wondered whether some officials would lose their jobs if the President really wasn't informed. ""The question becomes, why do the people who failed to keep him in the loop still have their jobs?"" he said on Anderson Cooper 360. Another columnist at the Times said it looks bad that Obama looks uncertain. ""(One of the) basic kinds of rules of management is: Never let the boss get caught off guard. The boss is caught off guard here. That is a problem,"" Charles Blow said. ""That is a management problem, and they're going to have to figure that management problem out.""","Intelligence Committee chair says President should have been told of some spying .

"(CNN)Just about every day on Facebook, I see posts by parents asking for advice related to their children. Granted, many of my friends are parents, but I imagine you see similar posts when you log on as well. And pretty much every time I read one, I wonder about the pluses and minuses of a world in which many parents now head to their social networks to make parenting decisions. Sure, getting advice on how to get a toddler to sleep through the night or how to deal with a fussy eater makes sense and seems relatively harmless. But is there something creepy about picking a baby name based on Internet responses or deciding on a punishment based on the opinions of followers? Last year, an expectant father created a website, NameMyDaughter.com, allowing anyone on the Internet to suggest and vote on a baby name for his daughter. 10 signs you might be addicted to your smartphone . Thankfully for his child, who was born in April, he and his wife reportedly did not go with the winning name of ""Cthulhu."" Instead, they chose the second place name, Amelia. My question: How is Amelia or any other child named by strangers online going to feel when they learn the origin of their name? ""I am sure the child will be happy to know that her name was approved of by thousands of strangers she will never meet,"" said Vicki Hoefle, author of the book ""Duct Tape Parenting: A Less is More Approach to Raising Respectful, Responsible, and Resilient Kids."" ""Can you imagine the outrage an adult would have if, say, a guy crowdsourced whether he should propose or not?"" asked Hoefle, a mom of five who has spent the past two decades working with families on parenting. Asking not just your followers but random strangers to choose a name for your child is no doubt one of the more extreme examples of crowdsourced parenting, but what about deciding discipline based on social media responses or asking for help with deeply personal issues such as a child's depression or anxiety, or a case of bullying, or a child's exploration of sex? Replace the 'sex talk' with the 'tech talk'? In conversations over email with parents across the country, I found a real split in opinions about whether using social media to help parent is positive or inappropriate. Put mom of four Janeane Davis in the positive camp. She said that since many of us live far away from our parents and friends, ""social media crowdsourcing is a quick way of getting a lot of opinions and ideas at one time."" Davis, founder of the blog Janeane's World, said she only crowdsourced for her children once. ""I asked people how they got their sons to behave better at home and school. I did get some good ideas. I tried one of them, and it worked,"" said Davis, who said she'd do it again. Louise Sattler, a mom of two grown children in Los Angeles, also believes crowdsourced parenting is OK in certain cases. ""We use to call it getting advice during coffee klatches,"" said Sattler, a school psychologist, educational consultant and owner of a business providing sign language instruction. 28 web abbreviations parents should know . Pam Moore, host of the blog Whatevs, believes there is an age limit on when it's no longer OK to discuss a child's behavior on social media and ask for help regarding that behavior, even though she admits she's not quite sure what that key age is. ""Whether it's tantrums in kindergarten or wetting the bed at age 9 ... I believe children still have the right to some privacy about their lives,"" said Moore, a mom of two who writes about motherhood, marathons and life in Boulder, Colorado. ""I think that if you aren't sure whether to post something about your kid on Facebook, ask yourself how the child (and you) would feel if he or she ever came across it at the age of 12. If you wouldn't want him or her to see it on your timeline, then it's probably not a great idea to post it on Facebook."" There are things that happen within the family that do not need to be aired in public, said Tracey Koch, a mom of two and nurse practitioner who works with teens in Lewiston, Idaho. Chances are, your teen has sexted . ""I think you are risking your child essentially shutting down if you publicly discuss punishment over social media. The postings are too easily shared, and information spreads too widely."" Beth Engelman, a mom of a 9-year-old in Chicago, agrees. She also thinks parenting by crowdsourcing, which can lead to a multitude of suggestions, can be overwhelming and make parents feel less secure about their own instincts. ""I think the ease in which parents can go to social media often chips away at their confidence to trust their gut,"" said Engelman, co-founder of the blog Mommy on a Shoestring. ""The more you are reliant on others to help you make decisions, the less confident you feel making decisions on your own."" Another issue, said educational psychologist, consultant and parenting coach Lori Day, is when parents rely on social media, when they should instead be talking to professionals such as a teacher, pediatrician or child psychologist. Teen 'like' and FOMO anxiety . Day notes that people may too often view the advice of some followers and friends, especially popular bloggers who have a large digital footprint, as experts, when in fact they don't have any expertise on the issues at hand. ""It's not necessarily about what your credentials are because you could be one of those really wise parents that has really good advice, but sometimes the way I see it articulated, it's almost as if the person is a psychologist and they're in positions that they really don't know about and they aren't educated on, they have no work experience on, and that gets me worried,"" said Day, author of ""Her Next Chapter,"" a book about mother-daughter book clubs. ""That's when parents really need to be seeking out professional help."" Separated at birth, reunited on Facebook . Hoefle, whose newest book ""The Straight Talk on Parenting"" will be released in April, encourages parents to see themselves as ""the true experts in their children's lives,"" not their thousands of friends and followers on Facebook and Twitter. ""By answering just a few questions, they can begin to see clearly the strategy that will work best for their children and one that they can actually implement to get the kind of long-term sustainable change they are looking for."" When do you think crowd sourced parenting is a bad way to go? Share your thoughts with Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","Asking for parenting advice via social networks can be harmless, but it can also be invasive, Kelly Wallace found .
Sharing disciplinary problems, emotional issues or developmental issues may be cause resentment for children .

"The U.S. ambassador to France met with French diplomats Monday over allegations that the National Security Agency intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in France over a 30-day period. Ambassador Charles Rivkin was summoned to the French Foreign Ministry in Paris after the details of the alleged spying appeared in the French newspaper Le Monde. ""These kinds of practices between partners, that violate privacy, are totally unacceptable,"" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters at an EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Monday.  ""We must quickly assure that these practices aren't repeated."" U.S. President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande spoke Monday, according to a White House statement. ""The President and President Hollande discussed recent disclosures in the press -- some of which have distorted our activities and some of which raise legitimate questions for our friends and allies about how these capabilities are employed,"" the news release said. ""The President made clear that the United States has begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share."" A news release from Hollande's office said he expresed his ""deep disapproval with regard to these practices"" to Obama and that such alleged activities would be unacceptable between allies and friends. The two presidents agreed that French and American intelligence services will cooperate on investigating the report, according to the statement from the French president's office. Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who was in Paris and met with the Qatari foreign minister, wouldn't address the specifics of the report, but told reporters that France is one of the U.S.'s closest allies. He added that the countries work together to protect the security of their citizens, which is a ""very complicated task"" in today's world. Kerry said ""lots of countries"" engage in intelligence activities to try to prevent terrorist attacks. He said Rivkin would would continue consultations with the French. Millions of calls intercepted . The National Security Agency monitored the phone calls made in France, Le Monde reported Monday, citing documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. ""Telephone communications of French citizens are intercepted on a massive scale,"" Le Monde said in its online English edition. The intercepts took place from December 10, 2012, to January 8, 2013, the article reported. An NSA graph shows an average of 3 million data intercepts a day. According to Le Monde, this is how the system worked: ""When a telephone number is used in France, it activates a signal which automatically triggers the recording of the call. Apparently this surveillance system also picks up SMS (text) messages and their content using key words. Finally, the NSA apparently stores the history of the connections of each target -- or the meta-data."" It wasn't immediately clear from the article if the conversations were recorded or just the data surrounding each call. NSA leaker Snowden deserves a Nobel Prize, his father says . Other spying allegations . The report comes a day after the German news magazine Der Spiegel said the NSA ""systematically"" eavesdropped on the Mexican government. It hacked the public e-mail account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, which was also used by Cabinet members, according to Der Spiegel. The magazine also quoted documents leaked by Snowden. ""This practice is unacceptable, illegitimate and against Mexican and international law,"" Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It added that it would push for a speedy investigation. Mexico lashes out against report of U.S. spying . ""In a relationship between neighbors and partners, there is no room for the practices alleged to have taken place,"" the ministry said. A senior U.S. State Department official told CNN that the Mexican government reached out about the report and that the two governments will be discussing it via diplomatic channels. The NSA said it would not ""comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity, and as a matter of policy we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations."" ""As the President said in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly, we've begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share,"" the agency added. In September, Mexico and Brazil summoned U.S. ambassadors after media reports that the United States had spied on their countries' presidents. A Brazilian news report described the alleged espionage, citing Glenn Greenwald, a Brazil-based journalist who similarly obtained documents from Snowden. Glenn Greenwald to join media venture backed by eBay founder Omidyar . One of the alleged NSA documents leaked to Greenwald dates from June 2012, a month before Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was elected. In it, the candidate talks about whom he would select for his Cabinet if elected. The documents did not reference any specific communications with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff but show the methods the NSA allegedly used to track e-mails and mobile phone communications with close advisers. ""It was very clear in the documents that they had already carried out the spying,"" Greenwald told Globo TV's Sunday night program ""Fantastico.""

"A divided Supreme Court, debating Wednesday whether public prayers at a New York town's board meetings are permissible, looked at the country's history of religious acknowledgment in the legislature and the court's own traditions. Two local women brought suit against Greece, New York, officials, objecting that the monthly public sessions on government open with invocations they say have been overwhelmingly Christian in nature over the years. The hour of sharp oral arguments presented another contentious case over the intersection of faith and the civic arena. The court's conservative majority appeared to have the votes to allow the policy to continue in some form, but both sides expressed concerns about the level of judicial and government oversight over the content presented by members of a particular faith. ""We are a very religiously diverse country,"" said Justice Samuel Alito, who worried about the town officials articulating binding guidelines on what can be said. ""All should be treated equally. So I can't see how you can compose a prayer that is acceptable to all these"" religions. But Justice Sonia Sotomayor worried about the effect on local citizens who choose not to stand and bow their heads when asked during a public prayer. ""You think any of those people wouldn't feel coerced to stand?"" The high court began its public session Wednesday as it has for decades, with the marshal invoking a traditional statement that ends, ""God save the United States and this honorable court."" The town of about 94,000 residents outside Rochester began allowing prayers to start its meetings in 1999, after years of having a ""moment of silence."" Co-plaintiffs Linda Stephens and Susan Galloway challenged the revised policy, saying officials repeatedly ignored their requests to modify or eliminate the practice, or at least make it more inclusive. ""It's very divisive when you bring government into religion,"" Stephens told CNN from her home. ""I don't believe in God, and Susan is Jewish, so to hear these ministers talk about Jesus and even have some of them who personally question our motives, it's just not appropriate."" Atheist gets her day at the Supreme Court . The town government counters that after concerns from the two women and others, it sought diverse voices, including a Wiccan priestess, to offer invocations. Officials say they do not review the content of the remarks, nor censor any language. ""The faith of the prayer giver does not matter at all,"" said John Auberger, Greece's board supervisor, who began the practice shortly after taking office 1998. ""We accept anyone who wants to come in and volunteer to give the prayer to open up our town meetings."" A federal appeals court in New York found the board's policy to be an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which forbids any government ""endorsement"" of religion. Those judges said it had the effect of ""affiliating the town with Christianity."" Congress and state legislatures regularly open their sessions with a prayer. The question in part before the court is whether local government bodies are different, in that there might be more active involvement with the local citizenry, who may want to personally petition the town in zoning, tax, and other matters. But after the ""oyez"" intonation by Marshal Pamela Talkin -- a rite introduced by Chief Justice John Marshall in the early 19th century -- to kick off the high court session, Justice Elena Kagan explored the limits of permissible government action by making the issue more personal. She asked whether the court could suddenly invite a Christian minister to invoke the following prayer, inside the ornate marbled courtroom: 'We acknowledge the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.' ""Would that be permissible?"" asked Kagan. Thomas Hungar, attorney for Greece, suggested courts are different, and that the national legislature had done similar prayers since the nation's founding. ""Whatever line might be drawn between non-legislative bodies and legislative bodies,"" he said, ""it would be incongruous, if Congress could have legislative prayers and the states couldn't."" But the lawyer for the women, supported by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said that unlike most legislatures, there was no official policy on prayers in Greece. ""The policy should give guidelines to chaplains that say: Stay away from points in which believers are known to disagree,"" said Douglas Laycock. ""And we think the town should do what it can to ameliorate coercion. It should tell the clergy: Don't ask people to physically participate. That's the most important thing."" That was when some on the court began to have doubts about when and to what extent lawmakers -- and later courts -- should be advising various faiths what to say, and parsing what is sectarian and not in the language. ""Give me an example of a prayer that is acceptable to all of the groups that I mentioned,"" said Alito. He had included Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists. When Laycock suggested something like, ""The prayers to the almighty, prayers to the creator,"" Alito and others were unconvinced, saying polytheists might object. ""What about devil worshippers?"" asked Justice Antonin Scalia, bringing laughter to the courtroom. ""Well, if devil worshippers believe the devil is the almighty, they might be OK with it,"" responded Laycock, smiling. Town prayers need less Jesus, more Krishna . ""Who was supposed to make these determinations? Is there supposed to be an officer of the town council that will review?"" asked Chief Justice John Roberts. ""Do prayers have to be reviewed for his approval in advance?"" Justice Anthony Kennedy, who may prove the decisive, or ""swing,"" vote in this petition, was especially vocal. ""It just seems to me that enforcing that standard involves the state very heavily in the censorship and the approval or disapproval of prayers,"" he said. ""I'm serious about this. This involves government very heavily in religion."" He also suggested small towns deserve as much right to allow a brief prayer in public sessions as elsewhere. ""In a way it sounds quite elitist to say, well, now, we can do this in Washington and Sacramento and Austin, Texas, but you people up there in Greece can't do that."" Several members of Congress were in attendance for the argument, including Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican. ""Every day before the Senate meets, the Senate chaplain comes out and gives a prayer, and that's important to us,"" Rubio told CNN just after arguments ended. ""It's part of our country's tradition; it's also our constitutional right, to be able to exercise that. And I thought it was important to defend that here today."" Nearly 120 members of Congress, mostly Republicans, along with 18 state attorneys general have filed supporting legal briefs backing the city. The Obama administration is doing the same. But the two plaintiffs, who were also watching in the courtroom, said they have faced harassment from their community and even vandalism of their property. ""The pastors face the people, they don't face the town government, so it's like they're praying over us,"" Galloway told CNN after the argument. ""When they all stood and I sat, and I have a hundred eyes looking at me, and questioning what's going on, they think I'm being disrespectful. It does put a lot of pressure on you and it makes you very uncomfortable. It singles you out, and that shouldn't be in my town government, and it shouldn't be anywhere."" The high court has generally taken a case-by-case approach on determining just when the state intrudes unconstitutionally into religion, while generally allowing faith to be acknowledged in a limited basis in a public forum. ""In God We Trust"" remains on currency; the Pledge of Allegiance and oaths of office mention a creator; and menorah and creche displays are permitted in local parks. But the justices acknowledge the tricky line they must walk -- politically, socially, legally-- when deciding Establishment Clause appeals. ""It's hard because the (Supreme) Court lays down these rules and everybody thinks that the court is being hostile to religion and people get unhappy and angry and agitated,"" said Kagan near the end of the argument. ""Part of what we are trying to do here is to maintain a multi-religious society in a peaceful and harmonious way. And every time the court gets involved in things like this, it seems to make the problem worse rather than better."" The case is Town of Greece, N.Y. v. Galloway (12-696). A ruling is expected by early summer. Test your knowledge of the U.S. Supreme Court .","Several members of Congress in attendance for the argument .

"The mother of a teen with autism who went missing three weeks ago declared Friday, ""My son, he is alive."" Her comments followed the police commissioner's assessment that the department was ""not hopeful"" of finding 14-year-old Avonte Oquendo alive. ""My thoughts are that my son is still out there and I want everyone to continue to help me search for my son. He is not gone,"" Vanessa Fontaine said Friday at a press conference outside of the school in Long Island City where her son ran away October 4. Sniffer dogs, video cameras, a search of the sewer system, missing-persons posters and fliers filling the streets, subway alerts and messages in city newspapers, and divers with sonar -- none of it has led officers to Avonte. ""Obviously we have devoted a tremendous amount of resources to the search,"" Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told CNN affiliate WABC on Thursday. ""Unfortunately, we are not hopeful that we're going to find this young man alive, but we are continuing our search."" Fontaine wants police to try new tactics in their search. ""I don't know what the commissioner was thinking of last night by saying that, but my son, he is alive, he is out there ...it's just that we are not looking in the right places,"" Fontaine told reporters. Autism facts . Bloodhounds . Avonte was last seen on surveillance video running out of Center Boulevard School. Three hours later, bloodhounds traced his scent to a marsh near his school, but lost the trail, a source close to the investigation said. An hour later, the bloodhounds picked up his scent again, this time at a nearby subway station, the source said. Avonte is fascinated by trains, his family has said.

"The rumor: You can damage your eyes by looking at a computer screen for too long . After staring at a monitor for hours on end, have your eyes ever felt dry, itchy or irritated? Has your vision become blurry, or have you even seen double? Has your head begun to pound because of all the squinting and straining? Annoying eye problems like these call for eyedrops -- or maybe for dropping your computer off a cliff. But are Macs and PCs really to blame for our eyestrain? The verdict: Computer use can definitely strain your eyes -- but there are ways to combat the damage . Studies have shown that between 50 and 90% of people who work in front of a computer screen have some symptoms of eye trouble. ""We definitely see a lot of people who complain of eyestrain,"" says opthalmologist Dr. Brian Boxer Wachler. ""Hours upon hours of close focusing without taking a break is usually the main culprit."" The problem is so common, there's even a name for it: Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). upwave: Is technology shortening your life? Wachler says that people usually blink around 18 times per minute, which refreshes the eyes naturally. But blink rates are reduced when staring at a computer screen or other digital device, and this can make your eyes burn, dry out, turn red or feel itchy. Sitting too close to your computer monitor, or holding a digital device closer to your eyes than you would normally hold a book or newspaper, also poses a problem, according to Wachler. ""This forces your eyes to work harder than usual as you strain to focus on tiny font sizes,"" he warns. Common symptoms of eyestrain and/or CVS include: sore eyes, dry eyes, teary eyes, blurry vision, double vision, light sensitivity, difficulty focusing on images, neck pain, headache or a combination of all of the above. upwave: How to prevent back and neck pain at work . Instead of turning a blind eye to the damage computers are doing to your eyes, there are quick and easy steps you can take to reduce eyestrain triggers. Jeffrey Anshel, founder of Corporate Vision Counseling and author of the Visual Ergonomics Handbook, suggests first lowering your monitor. ""Because conventional reading is normally done with the book or magazine held in a lowered position, having your monitor in a straight-ahead position is unnatural,"" he says. ""The top of the screen should be level with the eyes of the user, allowing for a slightly lowered viewing angle."" Next, reduce glare by angling the monitor so that you can see no reflections of any lights on the front surface of the monitor. The preferred viewing distance is between 20 and 40 inches from the eye to the front surface of the computer screen. Anshel suggests taking what he calls the ""three Bs approach:"" Blink, breathe and break. Because we blink less frequently when starting at a monitor, remember to blink often to moisten and refresh your eyes. Correct breathing can relax the eye muscles, so be conscious of your breathing -- especially in stressful situations, when people tend to hold their breath. And because computer work often requires intense concentration, frequent breaks are a must. ""Our eyes are just not designed to be used at that close distance for a long period of time,"" he says. ""Remember the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, take 20 seconds and look 20 feet away."" upwave: 5 ways to get fit when you're stuck at work all day . By making these minor adjustments, says Anshel, you'll reduce eyestrain and improve your overall health, too. ""There is no one solution to all types of problems encountered with computer use,"" he concludes, ""but, with a little research, the answer to many of these problems may be right before your eyes.""

"America's rich generally have better schools, tidier parks and (surprisingly enough) more trees. But are their neighborhoods also more likely to be mapped by Google? That's the question two readers asked after I published a series of stories on East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, which I called ""the most unequal place in America,"" based on its extraordinary level of income inequality. The readers noticed something I hadn't: The rich side of Lake Providence, which is the largest town in the parish, is mapped in detail by Google Street View; the poor side isn't. ""After reading I your article, I wanted to see where this Lake Providence in Louisiana is. So I went to Google map and found it,"" wrote Sam Patadia, a 63-year-old in Houston. ""Then I decided to look at the town through Google street view to see the houses there but I was surprised to find that even Google discriminates against poor. They have the street view of most of the northern part of the town but very little on the south side though the south side has more streets."" ""I found it interesting that Google did not drive thru the streets on the south side like they did on the north side,"" another person wrote. ""Maybe I am viewing in wrong but it appears that even Google divided the area."" So why map the rich side and not the poor? I have all sorts of guesses, but Google is the only one with answers. Unfortunately, the company wasn't much help. ""We try to cover as many streets as possible but occasionally we miss the odd one or two -- for example there may have been road work that day, a street may have been inaccessible or simply because of human error our drivers may have missed a street,"" a Google spokeswoman said in an e-mail to me. ""It's also possible that we did drive a certain street, but discovered that when processing the imagery, the photographs collected did not meet our high quality imagery standards due to unforeseeable challenges like shadows, poor visibility conditions, etc. ""Hopefully we can come back and photograph it at a future date."" Hopefully so. Because I don't particularly buy those arguments. The odds that an entire side of the town -- a small town, sure, but still a town -- would be under construction or would be photographed during an extreme weather event strikes me as implausible. The streets on the poor side of Lake Providence are generally narrower and harder to navigate than those on the north, so maybe that had something to do with it. Maybe fear is a factor. Perhaps the driver taking these images didn't want to drive through the poor side of town with cameras tacked to his roof. Maybe it was racism, since the poor side is largely black. Or maybe Google prioritizes areas based on the number of businesses there or the number of times Internet users search for addresses in that zone. Those are just theories, of course, and Susan Cadrecha, a Google spokeswoman, said none of them are accurate. Lake Providence was last mapped in 2008, she said, and it is unclear why the driver mapped one side of town and not the other. The region, and Louisiana as a whole, are less mapped than the company would like, she said. ""It wasn't for any reason about the demographics or anything like that -- or it being a poor area,"" she told me. ""That does not factor into our decisions in any way to map areas. We're constantly updating this imagery and we're constantly trying to make it as accurate as possible ... We want the whole world to be mapped, that's our eventual goal. We want people to be able to explore different areas."" And maybe I'm being unfair by raising this line of questioning. Google is a private company, even though its services, including maps, have started to feel so important that they're almost like public goods. It would make sense in a profit-minded way that they would provide Street View in places where it's most needed or most likely to be used. That's probably the reason only select parts of Africa are mapped with Street View, while much of North America and Europe are. (I asked Google what percentage of the United States is mapped with Street View and have not received a response; the company would say Street View is available in more than 3,000 cities and 54 countries, plus the Arctic and Antarctica. Google Street View cars have driven more than 6 million ""unique miles"" since the project kicked off in 2007, the company said). Technology costs money, and people with money tend to drive the development and deployment of tech. Plus, Lake Providence is just one little place, one example floating in an ocean of data. There are numerous counterpoints. You can search street view in the Bronx and the south side of Chicago. In 2011, I wrote about a fascinating photography project called ""A New American Picture"" that used Street View to highlight poverty. That project includes Google-sourced images of poor neighborhoods in New Jersey, California, Illinois, Texas, Arkansas, Maryland, New Mexico, Florida and elsewhere. Cadrecha told me Google added Street View functionality to Skid Row in Los Angeles earlier this year. So, there are poor neighborhoods on Street View. Plenty. But it is somewhat amazing to me that in this one little town -- the one that happens to be the most economically divided in the country -- the divisions extend into the very way the place is mapped. Maybe that has real implications for life there, and maybe it doesn't. It's certainly easier to find a new place if you can take a digital look at where you're headed. It may matter more for how outsiders, like those who e-mailed me, see the town. But the symbolism is what gets me. Part of Lake Providence -- a substantial part, which includes the public high school and some businesses -- is missing on Google Street View. The digital version of Lake Providence, in that sense, is like the real world: Its poverty is hidden. Is that true in your community? Take a look and let me know.","Readers notice the poor side of a town isn't mapped with Google Street View .

"South African Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius will face two additional gun-related charges when he goes on trial for murder next year, a spokesman for South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority said. The charges will be heard alongside the murder charge when Pistorius' trial begins in March, Nathi Mncube told CNN. Pistorius, nicknamed the ""Blade Runner"" for the special prostheses he uses for sprinting, has admitted to shooting dead his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in his high-end home on Valentine's Day. But he has said it was an accident. The gun-related charges are not new but have been moved from the South Gauteng jurisdiction where they were filed to the jurisdiction where the murder trial is being held, North Gauteng. Pistorius is accused of two separate instances of firing a gun in a public space. The National Prosecuting Authority decided to transfer them so that ""all charges against Pistorius can be heard at the same place at the same time in front of the same judge,"" Mncube said. The state has indicted the track star on a premeditated murder charge and, if convicted, he faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. Legal analysts in South Africa say they think the prosecution will seek to characterize Pistorius as a trigger-happy, irresponsible gun owner. However, this apparent strategy could backfire if the gun-related charges made it seem less likely that Pistorius shot Steenkamp deliberately, said Kelly Phelps, a CNN legal analyst and lecturer in the law faculty of the University of Cape Town. The alleged gun-related offenses, which will be prosecuted under South Africa's Firearms Control Act, date back to before the death of Steenkamp, but were not previously acted on. The fact the National Prosecuting Authority is pursuing the charges now adds weight to the idea that prosecutors are seeking to create a negative ""character picture"" of Pistorius, Phelps said. Pistorius, a double amputee, denies the murder charge and has said he mistook his girlfriend for a home invader when he fired shots from a pistol through a bathroom door that the 29-year-old was behind. A spokeswoman for Pistorius said this month that he's hired an American forensic team to give expert testimony to cast doubt on evidence against him.","Oscar Pistorius will face two gun-related charges alongside a murder charge, prosecutors say .

"(CNN)European counterterrorism agencies scrambled Friday to assess the potential danger of a complex and growing terrorism threat exposed by the arrests of more than two dozen people with suspected links to Islamic extremists. As many as 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people could be ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, a Western intelligence source told CNN. European Union and Middle East intelligence agencies had identified an ""imminent threat"" to Belgium, and possibly to the Netherlands, the source told CNN. ""There is a tremendous amount of concern over sleeper cells in Europe,"" said Western official with direct knowledge of the situation. Authorities worry about a rash of copycat attacks throughout Europe, according to the official, who compared the problem to ""a slow-motion car accident happening right in front of us."" Intelligence officials in Europe were trying to determine the nature of the wider threat, a senior European counterterrorism official told CNN.  They were monitoring groups of men who have returned from fighting in Syria. It is believed ISIS directed the men to return to Europe to launch attacks in retaliation for airstrikes against the terror group in Syria and Iraq, according to the official. Overall, authorities made 17 arrests related to the Belgium threat -- 13 in Belgium and four at two locations in France. Here are the latest developments related to the terror threat in the West: . • The suspected Islamist terrorists who had a shootout with police on Thursday in Verviers, Belgium, have ties to ISIS-linked cells in other European countries, a senior Belgian counterterrorism source told CNN's Paul Cruickshank. The two suspects who died in the shootout are believed to have fought with ISIS in Syria, the source said. •  A total of 122,000 police officers, gendarmes and military personnel are deployed across France as part of the security plan, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said. • There does not appear to be a command-and-control element to last week's Paris attacks at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine and two additional locations other than a general ""go forward and do something,"" the Western official with direct knowledge told CNN. The attacks were ""highly franchised terrorism with general instructions."" • Sectarian turmoil in Yemen is bolstering al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's (AQAP) local recruitment and buying it space for attacks against the West and train the next generation of bomb makers, according to one Western diplomat. • Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, Britain's senior counterterrorism officer, said additional police patrols were being put in place at Jewish community centers, synagogues and schools. • An 18-year-old woman was arrested at Stansted Airport near London on suspicion of terrorism offenses, London's Metropolitan Police said on Twitter. • British Prime Minister David Cameron called on his country and the United States to fight the ""poisonous ideology"" behind the terrorist attacks that killed at least 17 people in France this month. ""Britain and America both face threats to our national security from people who hate what our countries stand for and are determined to do us harm,"" Cameron said at a White House news conference with President Barack Obama. • Obama promised to ""do everything in our power"" to assist France in its effort to combat terrorism. • Two people suspected of involvement with the alleged terror cell in Verviers were detained trying to cross from France into Italy through the Frejus tunnel, a spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said. • Belgian federal prosecutor Eric Van der Sypt said 13 people were arrested in a dozen anti-terror raids. Authorities believed the ""threat of a terrorist attack was very imminent."" • The suspected terror cell, which included people returning from Syria, planned to target police officers, Van der Sypt said. Police said they recovered weapons, bomb-making materials and police uniforms. • Belgium put 150 troops on standby for anti-terror operations. • At least a dozen people were detained in the Paris region overnight in connection with last week's shootings in Paris, the city prosecutor's office said. • Two men in their early 40s were arrested in Berlin on suspicion of links to ISIS, police said. They did not appear to have been planning attacks. Berlin police spokesman Stefan Redlich said the investigation had started a year ago; the police operation planned several weeks ago. • The Netherlands said it was not raising its terror threat level, currently at ""substantial,"" the second-highest . ""That means there is a realistic threat, but no concrete or specific information of an attack,"" said government spokesman Edmond Messchaert. • The current level of security in Belgium will remain for at least one month and will then be evaluated to determine if it needs to be modified, the country's prime minister said late Friday. ""From the time we are confronted with an increase in the threat, we went to level 3 on a scale of 4; we must mobilize the resources available,"" Charles Michel told CNN affiliate RTL. European counterterrorism agencies have been trying to identify and thwart potential threats after the deadly attacks in Paris last week, in which 17 people were killed. Security services are working to track those associated with the attackers: brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly. Neetin Karasular, a suspected Belgian trafficker in weapons who met with Coulibaly's widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, is in custody, Karasular's attorney, Michel Bouchat, told CNN. Karasular was charged with association with wrongdoers and firearm offenses, in Charleroi, Belgium. But his attorney said the arrest was not connected to the other Belgian raids. Coulibaly, who attacked a kosher supermarket in Paris last Friday, pledged allegiance to ISIS. However, the Kouachis, the men who French authorities say carried out the deadly shooting at the offices of the French satirical magazine, are believed to have had links to AQAP, which has claimed responsibility for the shootings. A European counterterrorism official told CNN that there were indications that ISIS leadership had directed returnees from Iraq and Syria to launch attacks in Europe in revenge for Syria and Iraq airstrikes. The official, who cited France, the United Kingdom and Belgium as countries facing a particular threat, said counterterrorism agencies in Germany are on high alert. Several European nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, are participating in the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq. CNN's Deborah Feyerick, Paul Cruickshank, Susannah Palk, Lindsay Isaac and Sophia Saifi contributed to this report.","Islamist terrorists in Belgium tied to ISIS-linked cells in Europe, source says .
