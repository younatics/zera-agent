"Internal tensions in both political parties dominated this week's final trip around the 'Inside Politics' table. John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. 1. Seething over Schumer . Look for more open battles between the Obama White House and congressional Democrats as we move into 2015. Julie Hirschfeld Davis of The New York Times described White House officials as ""privately still pretty angry"" at New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer for saying the President was wrong to prioritize health care legislation over other issues in his first term. And there is also bad blood after the White House pulled the plug on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's effort to negotiate a tax package with congressional Republicans. ""I think we're going to see in the weeks and months ahead a real sort of division starting to emerge, especially as the White House starts to really press on trade, which is an issue that divides Democrats,"" said Hirschfeld Davis. ""I think we're going to see that daylight get even brighter."" 2. Boehner's secret weapon . House Speaker John Boehner makes clear he has no interest in shutting the government down, and is no question in stronger political shape than he was in some past battles with the conservative grass roots. But stronger doesn't mean he doesn't appreciate a little help, and Robert Costa of The Washington Post took us inside efforts by the newest member of the leadership team to help keep the GOP troops in line. At issue: the work of House Whip Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana. ""He has been able to finagle this thing for the last few days and make sure that conservatives feel like they are part of the process in the House leadership and that they're not looking for a showdown the way they did a year ago when they got a shutdown over health care reform,"" said Costa. 3. Room for a ""nerd"" in the GOP 2016 pack? There are a half dozen GOP governors mulling 2016 presidential runs, including the CEOs of Texas, Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio, Wisconsin and New Jersey. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times says keep an eye on the self-described ""nerd"" who was just re-elected in the blue state of Michigan. Martin talked to Snyder when he was in Washington this past week getting an award from Governing Magazine. ""It's this great dance, John, as you know,"" said Martin. ""You talk to these politicians and they are waiting for you to ask the question and finally you do: 'So do you want to run for president?'"" ""And of course he has to answer that right now he is fully focused on Michigan and telling the Michigan story and chief in that is that the unemployment rate has dropped in that state that was so hard hit during the recession. But he is someone that at the very least wants to be in the mix for 2016."" 4. A 2016 litmus test for Christie? President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration are not only infuriating key conservatives in Congress -- they are triggering legal challenges from many states, and in a way that could ripple into the 2016 presidential race. Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post notes that the governors of Indiana, Wisconsin and Louisiana are signatories to the suit, as is the GOP governor of South Carolina. All factor into 2016 talk of potential candidates or maybe vice presidential picks on the GOP side. But Henderson notes one glaring name not on the list: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. ""Christie has said so far that he doesn't want to talk at all about immigration reform -- he won't do that unless he decides to run,"" said Henderson. ""But it is a question of whether or not this lawsuit will be kind of a litmus test going forward in 2016 and whether or not he is going to be pressured to sign on and how he's going to navigate that."" 5. Hillary 2016 announcement -- maybe later . There is nothing certain when it comes to Clintonland, but the safer bet appears to be later rather than sooner as to when we will get official word about her 2016 intentions. The timing debate has been going on for months. Some allies believe an early announcement -- as in by the end of 2014 - is best, to end the doubts and bring early order to the organization. Others say there is little reason to rush, noting the lack of a formidable opponent and the added scrutiny and requirements that come with being a candidate in the eyes of the law. The former secretary of state is holding meetings to discuss her team, but is described by friends as not in too much of a hurry to make a final decision and then let it be known. So, for now anyway, the betting is she will wait a bit into 2015.","Battles are brewing between the White House and Democrats .

"(CNN) -- ""I consider the people of New York my patients,"" acting New York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said this week as he cited health-related reasons for recommending New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ban hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" to develop natural gas resources in the state. New York's environmental conservation commissioner joined in with the recommendation, which the governor quickly accepted. But if New York's taxpayers are indeed Zucker's patients, they should consider suing him for malpractice, because the new ban on hydraulic fracturing in New York has nothing to do with public health or good science. Instead, it's an anti-scientific, political decision that will harm the country as it panders to far-left environmentalists. New York has become the first state with commercial gas reserves to ban a practice that has revolutionized the U.S. energy industry. Fracking injects sand water and small amounts of chemicals into deep oil- and gas-containing formations, cracking the rocks and allowing the trapped gas and oil to be recovered. Hydraulic fracturing has saved Americans billions of dollars, contributed to reduced U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and greatly bolstered the U.S. geopolitical position and America's energy security. Frustration with this ill-considered ban isn't just partisan warfare. While my own politics are conservative, I am not reflexively hostile to alternative energy. Indeed, I have worked with both Republican and Democratic politicians and groups on energy and environmental issues. (I recently co-authored a report with former Democratic Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman on smart ways to cost-effectively boost renewable energy, and have also worked on joint projects promoting sustained support for energy research and development with current Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz when he was at MIT). However, I am reflexively hostile to deception, especially when undertaken by people who cloak themselves in the mantle of science. And that's exactly what is happening here. While science is always a subject of continuing inquiry, the strong consensus of research on hydraulic fracturing is that overall, it is good for the environment, the economy and our geopolitical position. The United States has seen dramatic reductions in national carbon dioxide emissions largely as a result of hydraulic fracturing, which allowed natural gas to become cheap and abundant, and mostly displacing dirtier, higher-emission coal in the generation mix. Hydraulic fracturing, and the similar techniques used for ""tight oil"" drilling, have actually allowed the United States to become the world's leading oil producer in 2014. The economics of the fracking revolution are also overwhelmingly positive. IHS, perhaps the most respected independent energy consultancy, says the industry will be able to support 3.3 million jobs, adding more than $125 billion to state coffers through state tax revenues by 2020. By 2025, the average family could be saving $3,500 per year due to hydraulic fracturing, a staggering figure in a country with a median family income of just $52,000. And support for fracking isn't split down party lines -- Moniz has called fracking safe and ""a bridge to a low-carbon future,"" a finding supported by several Environmental Protection Agency investigations and former Obama Environmental Protection Administrator Lisa Jackson. Not to be outdone, Obama's former Energy Secretary Steven Chu has also declared that ""this is something you can do in a safe way."" All of these leaders have been aggressive champions of renewable energy, and none could be accused of being a pawn of fossil fuel interests. By contrast, the integrity of some of the largest and most powerful fracking critics is severely compromised. Popular anti-fracking movies Gasland and Gasland II have perpetuated many dubious claims that have been widely debunked. Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, hailed New York's decision. Yet between 2007 and 2010, long after the hydraulic fracturing revolution was under way, the Sierra Club was reported to have taken more than $25 million from natural gas drillers to fund its fight against coal power (unsurprisingly, they pushed gas as a cleaner alternative). Of course, there are costs as well as benefits to fracking. And it is possible that at some point, new experience or information will come to light that would change our thinking. But we've already fracked tens of thousands of U.S. wells, and the endorsements mentioned above come in full light of that experience. Increased natural gas production could have brought billions of dollars and thousands of jobs to New York's hard-hit Southern Tier, which sits over the Marcellus Shale formation, one of America's richest potential sources of natural gas. Cuomo's ban will be particularly devastating for poor New Yorkers, who can now be expected to struggle with high home heating bills due to expensive imported gas. Unfortunately, as supporters of the ban have realized, New York's move sends a signal to other states. But it also has geopolitical implications. The boom in hydraulic fracturing and tight oil production in the United States has helped undermine Russia's international standing by contributing to plummeting global oil prices. America's ability to produce and potentially export more natural gas could similarly reduce Russia's ability to leverage natural gas exports to Europe. So in the face of science, economics and geopolitics, why did Cuomo support the ban? In his Q&A with reporters after his announcement, the governor probably came pretty close to the truth on the politics behind the fracking decision when he said it was ""probably the most emotionally charged issue I have ever experienced."" ""I am not a scientist,"" he said, using the same formulation as that of a number of GOP lawmakers who have been criticized for using it with climate change. Well, the science and policy of a state ban on hydraulic fracturing is easy compared to the complexities of understanding the global climate system. And if America follows New York's terrible example, the troubling consequences will be there for all to see -- experts and non-experts alike.","New York's decision has nothing to do with health or science .

The process has saved billions and bolstered U.S. energy security .

"(CNN) -- One of the key demands from the national wave of demonstrations protesting recent police killings of unarmed black men is that law enforcement agencies expand the practice of equipping officers with dashboard cameras, body cameras and other recording devices, on the theory that visual recordings of controversial encounters will make it easier to discover the truth in situations like the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, or the choking death of Eric Garner in New York. Activists from coast to coast have decried the lack of a grand jury indictment in either case. But a strong word of caution is in order for those who think the widespread use of cameras will reduce or eliminate instances of police brutality or unjustified killings. The available evidence makes it far from clear that cameras will have the beneficial effects being promised. The public's natural tendency to want to see for itself what has happened is understandable. ""We won't have to play this game of witnesses' memories and secret grand juries,"" if cameras are more widely used, says Benjamin Crump, the Brown family attorney, who is pushing what he calls the Michael Brown law. ""It'll just be transparent and we can see it for ourselves. We can hold people accountable when they have interactions with citizens."" The idea is gaining traction. President Obama has announced a $263 million package to help local police departments buy and use 50,000 cameras, and the New York Police Dept., the nation's largest, has launched a pilot program. But two criminology professors at Arizona State University, Justin Ready and Jacob Young, say cameras often come with unintended negative consequences. ""In our field research on body cameras, there have been many times when cameras made matters worse for the officer,"" the professors write. ""For example, in one situation an officer was trying to comfort a teenage girl who lived in an abusive home, but he found it difficult to show compassion and respect for her privacy with the camera rolling. ...The device can be a physical reminder to crime victims that they are on camera at times when they are most vulnerable and in need of privacy."" Since statistics show that fewer than 20% of police calls involve felony crimes and only 1% of calls result in the use of physical force, the vast majority of recordings will capture vulnerable victims rather than document instances of police using force. There's a related issue of whether witnesses will be less willing to share important information with officers if they suspect the conversation is being recorded. Another problem involves the crucial issue of when -- and whether -- officers are simply turning off cameras at crucial moments. In New Orleans earlier this year, a police officer shot a man named Armand Bennett in the forehead during a traffic stop, then failed to report the fact the incident happened (for which the city's police chief later apologized). As the press dug into the story, it turned out that the officer who shot Bennett was outfitted with a body camera, but the device was switched off. In San Diego, two controversial shootings were captured on police body-cam videos this year -- but police refused media requests to make the footage public, undercutting the idea that a video record can help the public understand what happens in a controversial case. Even when camera footage is available, say professors Ready and Young, ""it is possible that on-officer video creates a polarizing effect on some controversies because people with strong convictions about what has transpired during a police shooting may use the 'facts' that they see in the video footage to support their expectations about what occurred in the blind spots."" Washington Post blogger Radley Balko points out that merely having cameras isn't enough: ""In addition to making these videos public record, accessible through public records requests, we also need to ensure that police agencies implement rules requiring officers to actually use the cameras, enforce those rules by disciplining officers when they don't and ensure that the officers, the agencies that employ them, and prosecutors all take care to preserve footage, even if the footage reflects poorly on officers."" An additional problem is that evidence suggests that the presence of cameras doesn't necessarily make police officers more courteous or careful. A much-touted study of police in Rialto, California, found that using cameras led to a 60% drop in the use of force and a 88% decline in citizen complaints in a single year. But that experience is not universal. Dashboard cameras had been in use in Seattle for years, but in 2011 a federal Justice Department investigation still concluded that the department ""engages in a pattern or practice of using unnecessary or excessive force."" According to professors Ready and Young, ""police are actually more proactive when wearing cameras,"" in part because they can record circumstances that will support their reasons for taking action. As the nation prepares for the next 50,000 body-cams to hit the street, we'll face the same underlying question: Are the cops keeping us safe and also respecting everyone's civil liberties and constitutional rights? That's a question no amount of technology can answer.","Some argue that more cameras will help prevent cases like Brown, Garner killings .
Errol Louis says people should beware of unintended consequences .
He says cops may be less likely to respond well in some cases, victims may be inhibited .
More technology may not be the answer to better policing, he says ."
"After weeks of racial protests across the country, President Barack Obama is taking the time to deliver encouraging words about the future of race relations in America to a network that reaches a predominately young African-American audience. ""What I told the young people who I met with -- we're going to have more conversations over the coming months -- is, 'This isn't something that is going to be solved overnight,' Obama says in an interview with BET that will air Monday. ""'This is something that is deeply rooted in our society. It's deeply rooted in our history.'"" Once criticized for shying away from the topic of race early on in his presidency, Obama has more recently been forced to lead a discussion on the issue. In his interview, the President says African-American youth need to be both persistent and patient in order to make progress on the issue of racial tensions in America. ""It's important to recognize as painful as these incidents are, we can't equate what is happening now to what happened fifty years ago,"" the President said in the interview. ""If you talk to your parents, grandparents, uncles, they'll tell you that things are better -- not good, in some cases, but better."" ""The reason it's important for us to understand that progress has been made is that then gives us hope that we can make even more progress,"" he said. The President also urged persistence in the effort to solve racial tensions, reminding the audience that typically progress occurs in ""steps"" and ""increments."" ""You know, when you're dealing with something that's as deeply rooted as racism or bias in any society, you've got to have vigilance but you have to recognize that it's going to take some time and you just have to be steady so that you don't give up when we don't get all the way there,"" he said. In light of two recent back-to-back grand jury decisions not to indict white police officers in the deaths of unarmed black men, the President has vowed to take action. Obama announced last week that he and outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder are ""not going to let up"" in the effort to ease racial tensions that exists between law enforcement officers and minorities in communities nationwide.","President Obama tells BET racial tension ""isn't something that is going to be solved overnight""

"Well, that escalated quickly. In fairness to my conservative friends, there's noooooo way they could have ever known that their newest hero, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, would let loose a racist rant.  It was unimaginable, crazy.  Who'd have thought? Sure, he refused to recognize the legitimacy of the federal government, also known as the United States of America.  But so did the secessionists of Lincoln's time, and they weren't racists.  No, not at all. They just believed that some people should own other people and that the determining factor in deciding whether you were master or slave was the color of your skin. Besides, by what right does the federal gubmint own that land in Nevada?  Other than the fact that the federal government bought it and paid for it in 1848. (See the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.)  That doesn't mean it's ""theirs"" or anything, does it? Bundy said of blacks, ""I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro. They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom."" On Thursday, he defended his remarks. ""I don't think I'm wrong,"" Bundy told CNN's Bill Weir. ""I think I'm right."" So who can blame poor Sean Hannity for looking like a right-wing blockhead for promoting the cause of a guy who turned around and said crazy, racist things?  Well, I can. Let me tell Sean about the Racist:  The Racist hates federal subsidies. Not the subsidies that provide grassland to Nevada ranchers at below-market values. Nor the subsidies that bring water to the desert by, say, building Hoover Dam. Nor the subsidies that benefit mining operations in the Silver State. No, the Racist hates subsidies that sap the human soul: like food stamps for moms with hungry children. Especially if those moms happen to be, well, differently pigmented from him. Politicians denounce Bundy's racist remarks . That's what's so interesting, not about this racist moron but about the Republicans who supported him until he revealed his views on slavery. Bundy was plainly a nutcase, and the right-wing pundits and politicians should have seen that.  He should never have been portrayed as a hero or a victim or anything other than a lawbreaker, a freeloader, a moocher. A taker. For two decades, he grazed his cattle on land that did not belong to him and refused to pay the landowner.  Right-wingers, one would think, would hate that.  He refused to respect law enforcement, in fact threatened to take up arms against the peace officers whom Republicans usually trip over themselves to honor.  I thought conservatives believed in law and order. What if, instead of being a right-wing rancher who flouted the law, Bundy was the leader of a left-wing group of college radicals who occupied a government building?  Ronald Reagan notoriously said of Berkeley protestors, ""If there is to be a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement!"" Or what if Bundy had been the leader of the New Black Panther Party?  What if he and his followers had, for 20 years, brazenly stolen from the federal government, refused to obey court orders and threatened police with guns?  Would Hannity have been duped into defending him?  Fat chance. Or, umm, what if Bundy had been a Muslim, declaring a tiny caliphate on that dusty piece of Nevada?  Does anyone really think Fox News would have made a hero of him then? Cliven Bundy: Another conservative folk hero exposes racial nerve . Bundy's status as a deadbeat welfare queen should have been sufficient for the likes of Hannity to know better than to support him.  His threats of violence against American law enforcement personnel should have had Hannity up in arms. Instead, the right-wing noise machine once more looks like a bunch of dupes and dopes, blindsided when their newest hero turns out to be a racist.  It won't be the last time this happens.

"(CNN) -- In some ways, it's not surprising that Russians were happy to vote Vladimir Putin back into the presidency in 2012. After all, the economy grew by an average of 7% from Putin's emergence in 1999 as a national politician, through his first two terms as president until May 2008, while real incomes more than doubled. Pensions were paid, and Putin had been able to brag in his last annual address to the Federal Assembly that ""not only has Russia now made a full turnaround after years of industrial decline, it has become one of the world's ten biggest economies."" It may have been Putin's bellicose rhetoric and shirtless photo opportunities that grabbed headlines overseas, but the fact is, his popularity was fundamentally based on the perception of growing prosperity for Russian citizens. The problem for Putin now is that the remarkably felicitous combination of economic factors that fueled his popularity for so long seems to be crumbling around him. Tumbling oil prices have been one factor. Oil production increased 50% from 1999 to 2004, providing a real boon to the country's coffers as the oil price soared to a peak of over $140 a barrel in July 2008 (compared with about half that today). But even while macroeconomic indicators remained robust, there was a consensus among analysts that the previous drivers of Russian economic growth were exhausted, and that the government needed to return to a reform agenda to improve the investment environment, reduce red tape, and curb corruption, among other measures. Unfortunately, since returning to the presidency, Putin and his administration have disregarded this advice. For those of us who studied the Soviet experience in the early 1980s, a period when economic growth was near zero despite a massive windfall of petro-dollars, it started to feel like deja vu all over again. Indeed, by early 2014, even before the annexation of Crimea, there were clear signs of further economic deterioration as the ruble fell by 10% and first quarter capital outflows ballooned to a record rate of $50 billion. But over the summer and into the fall, the imposition of serious Western sanctions over Russian aggression in Ukraine and a more than 30% drop in the oil price have combined to suggest that a perfect storm is finally brewing that may make Putin's first near-decade in power look like a distant and fond memory. Just as earlier Russian leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin ended up unpopular mainly as a result of economic deprivation, a prolonged economic downturn in Russia would deeply erode the current wave of popularity that Putin is riding after the euphoria of annexing Crimea. The danger to his presidency was underscored as he delivered an aggressive and defiant State of the Union address this past week warning about unnamed enemies (although the U.S. and Europe were the implied targets) seeking to weaken Russia. The rhetoric seemed flat, especially so when juxtaposed with the wave of bad economic news and the fact that he chose not to seriously discuss the challenges the country is facing. How bad have things gotten? In the past week, the Finance Ministry downgraded expectations of 1.2% growth in 2015 to a contraction of 0.8%. Meanwhile, the ruble has lost more than 50% of its value since the beginning of the year, despite the Russian Central Bank spending more than $70 billion to defend it. In fact, by the middle of last month, Russian reserves were $103 billion less than at the beginning of the year. Worse, the Finance Ministry's estimates could actually look optimistic a year from now, as they are based on an $80 per barrel oil price. Given the recent growth in production, including U.S. shale oil, the oil price could easily fall further and remain low. Since revenues from oil and gas exports make up about half of the Russian federal budget, Moscow's capacity to meet existing social welfare obligations -- let alone plans for expanded defense spending -- will be curtailed. (And this does not even account for the increased costs to Moscow related to the annexation of Crimea and its activities in Eastern Ukraine, where a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe is developing as winter sets in.) There are already ominous signs of potential social unrest. Protesters marched in 40 cities across Russia last month over planned reductions in health care spending in 2015 of up to 20%. On December 2, Putin announced a freeze on government salaries that, in the context of an inflation rate of more than 8%, will see many facing a significant drop in their salaries. Almost a decade ago, I wrote that Putin was very lucky to emerge at a time of such positive economic conditions, many of which lay beyond his control. The situation today, however, is not so much that luck has turned against him, but that he has failed to address structural weaknesses in the Russian economy even as he conducts a not-so-covert war against his neighbor. When Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, most Russians and outside observers seemed resigned to at least another 12 years of his leadership, through 2024. But as things stand, not only do recent events call his re-election in 2018 into question, but if economic decline continues, the Duma elections scheduled for 2016 could shake the system. Any student of Russian history knows that Russia's path is frequently disrupted by nonlinear events, and today it appears increasingly possible that another could happen even in the next few years. If it does, Putin will end up lying on the dust heap of history. It couldn't happen to a nicer guy.","Andrew Kuchins: Growing economy was behind Putin's popularity .

"Lawmakers from both parties defended the Obama administration's attempt to rescue American journalist Luke Somers early Sunday morning, even though the dangerous mission did not result in saving Somer's life. ""It was an unfortunate outcome,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Republican, told Candy Crowley on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""But I do believe you have to make these kinds of decisions."" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, who also serves on committee, said on ""CNN Newsroom"" on Sunday, ""Obviously we would have loved to be able to rescue these hostages and preserve their lives."" ""But I think it was the right decision to make ... The President made the call, the tough call that it was worth the risk. And I think he was exactly right,"" he said. American photojournalist Luke Somers and South African Pierre Korkie, a teacher who was reportedly set to be released on Sunday, were fatally shot in the compound by terrorists as the secret mission unfolded, a U.S. official said Sunday. Some critics have argued, in light of recent hostage killings, the administration should reconsidered its policy not to negotiate ransoms with terrorist organizations. But in a visit to Afghanistan Sunday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel defended the administration's policy, while also acknowledging that the Pentagon needs to be careful in how it conducts raids. ""There's an immense amount of focus and time and review that goes into these operations,"" Hagel told reporters, according to a pool report. ""So, I don't think it's a matter of going back and having a review of our process. Our process is about as thorough as there can be."" ""Is it imperfect? Yes. Is there risk? Yes. But we start with the fact that we have an American that's being held hostage, and that American's life is in danger. That's where we start, and then we proceed from there,"" said the outgoing secretary. Both Rogers and Schiff also defended the administration's hostage policy -- and like Hagel -- they acknowledged that improvements need to be made to U.S. rescue operations. ""When you pay ransom, you get more kidnappings. That's certainly what we saw across Africa. We're certainly seeing it in Yemen as well,"" Rogers said. ""If we're going to be extorted into paying ransom to al Qaeda so that they can rape women and blow up buildings and kill civilians, men, women and children, that's a pretty bad plan to start with. I agreed with the President's decision."" Schiff reinforced Roger's position that paying ransoms only fuels more violence. ""I think you end up funding other hostage taking and the cycle just perpetuates itself, so I think our decision is the right one,"" he said. ""Rather, try to rescue our hostages than pay ransoms, and, of course, prospectively trying to keep our people out of harm's way. I think that is really the right policy, as painful as it is, and as enormously agonizing as it is for the families of these hostages.""","Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle defended the Obama administration's Yemeni rescue attempt .

"Over the weekend, Amber Vinson was in Ohio to plan her wedding. Today, the 29-year-old nurse is hospitalized in Atlanta, fighting the Ebola virus. What a difference a few days can make. Vinson is only the second person known to have contracted the deadly disease inside the United States. Both she and Nina Pham are nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where they  treated Thomas Eric Duncan when he was hospitalized for Ebola in late September. He died October 8. Though she lives in Texas, Vinson grew up in Ohio, and flew there over the weekend to visit family and take care of a few wedding plans. ""Very intelligent lady. We had great conversation. Nice bridal party. All her friends were nice,"" said Anna Younker, owner of Coming Attractions Bridal and Formal in Akron, Ohio. Vinson and her friends visited the shop Saturday. Younker said Vinson did not appear sick then, and was a great customer. However, she now wonders: ""How did you not think this through? You know, if you're supposed to be quarantined, you're at a hospital where the Ebola is alive, what made you think it's OK to get on a plane?"" How did nurse who treated Ebola patient fly on commercial jet? 'Ill but clinically stable' There are contradictory reports about how Vinson was feeling during her time in Ohio. Her uncle Lawrence Vinson told CNN's Don Lemon that his niece felt fine during her trip, and in fact didn't feel sick until waking up in Texas on Tuesday morning. But a federal official with direct knowledge of the case told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen that Vinson said she felt fatigue, muscle ache and malaise while she was in Ohio and on the flight home. The prospect that she might have felt sick during her time there has led health authorities to reach out to more people, from those on her initial Dallas-to-Cleveland flight to those she interacted with in Ohio. She was joined on her last flight to Texas by 132 other people. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden said she never should have set foot on the last flight at least, but another federal official told CNN that no one at the agency stopped her. Lawrence Vinson said there was no directive that she shouldn't have traveled. In fact, he said a CDC official -- through an intermediary in Texas -- gave his niece the go-ahead to fly, even after learning that she had an elevated temperature of 99.5 Fahrenheit. Officials confirmed that she got the OK to fly, although there were questions about who contacted whom. What's not disputed is that Vinson went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Tuesday. A day later, she was transferred to  Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which has successfully treated two other Ebola patients. Late Thursday, her family released a statement, thanking people for their support and asking for privacy. ""Amber is stable, and we are continuing to work with her doctors as her treatment progresses. Amber is a respected professional and has always had a strong passion for nursing,"" according to the statement. ""She followed all of the protocols necessary when treating a patient in Dallas, and right now, she's trusting in her doctors and nurses as she is now the patient. To that end, we ask that the media respect Amber's privacy and that of our family during this overwhelming experience."" 'A real sweetheart' Details about Vinson are starting to trickle out. She lives by herself and does not own any pets, according to CNN affiliate WEWS. She attended Firestone High School in Akron. Judith White, a teacher there, remembers Vinson as a straight-A student, with an interest -- even then -- in the medical field. ""She was a wonderful girl, role model, very motivated. She was international baccalaureate, which is our highest level. It's like a college course and I haven't seen her, of course, in quite a few years, but had followed her progress and she's just done so well,"" WEWS reported White said. Vinson graduated from Kent State University, where three close relatives are employed. ""While she was in the area over the weekend, she herself did not come to the Kent campus, but she did interact with her relatives. They returned to the Kent campus to work earlier this week, but once they learned of her illness in Dallas, they left the campus,"" Kent State spokesman Eric Mansfield said. ""They're going to stay away from the campus for 21 days and self monitor on their own,"" he said. Family members have asked for privacy and police have put up yellow tape around their house to prevent anyone from approaching. A family friend described Vinson as compassionate. ""She's a wonderful young lady, very quiet girl growing up. But she's a real sweetheart,"" Lory Harris told CNN affiliate WFAA. ""That's all I remember her as -- a sweetheart,"" Harris said.

"I'm sitting in the lounge car of a train and traveling at a fairly ordinary speed. But this is no ordinary train: the back end of the carriage is a giant floor-to-ceiling window, like a flickering movie screen on which the passing landscapes are acting out their various parts. There are volcanoes being majestic, and hills cloaked in forests of cypress trees and bamboo. There are rice fields shimmering with green and a shoreline of bays filled with boats and seaweed farms, which unravels as the train goes past. Moreover, every landscape has at least a couple of people in it, waving.  At me. I wave back -- when I remember -- but I'm a bit busy. My wine glass is being refilled. Behind me, by the bar, a gifted violin-and-piano duo is tackling everything from Mozart to Guns 'n' Roses, and they're asking for requests. And on the table in front of me is a selection of amuse-bouches either wrapped in leaves, or served on delicate porcelain or in bamboo boxes; mouthfuls of locally-sourced beef, wood-smoked fish, pungent sea urchin, plus of course fugu -- the fish that needs to be cooked by a highly trained and licensed chef, or you're dead. Exclusive and luxurious . I'm in Japan, a country famous for its trains, but generally not the sort  that allow their passengers to savor their surroundings like this one does. Shinkansen, the country's bullet trains, for example, have a fuselage-like interior which pays little heed to anything in its haste to get from one end of country to the other. But now Japan Rail Kyushu have invested big money -- over $34 million -- into a special train with the deliberate aim of going slow. This chocolate liveried locomotive chugs along the branch lines, truffling out local delicacies and hot springs, and giving locals cause to stop their planting and harvesting in order to stare and wave. The ""Seven Stars in Kyushu"" is Japan's answer to the Orient Express, with its seven carriages having space for just 30 people in 14 suites; and it is very exclusive, with some 21 applications for every berth. The interiors around me are examples of the best in Japanese craftsmanship: walls are of rosewood and maple, floors are made from walnut, window coverings are shoji paper screens, sliding glass doors are etched with flowers and birds. Volcanoes and hot springs . Part of the train's purpose is to ""introduce Kyushu to the world,"" according to the Seven Stars company, because Japan's third largest island is not a first-timer's destination. Kyushu is the most southwesterly main island in the chain, which means it is the warmest and most tropically lush, with more than its fair share of volcanoes and spas. So within a few hours of setting off from capital Fukuoka on our four-day itinerary, we've already got into hot water -- or more specifically, our feet have, into a mineral water footspa on the station platform at Yufuin, in a valley filled with plumes of rising steam. The journey here has been up through hill country, ambushing rivers, clattering across iron bridges, scything through rice terracing spiced with hurricane lilies -- crimson wildflowers that look like splashes of blood amongst the yellowing harvest. At the station, we are met by the Seven Stars luxury bus, which is to shadow us throughout our journey, ready to pounce whenever needed. This time it takes us to a tea-house in ornamental gardens where we try ""plum pudding"" -- actually a sort of sorbet with a plum at the center. Fast forward a day, and the landscape has changed completely. The train has rumbled south to the coastal city of Kagoshima, where Mount Sakurajima looms, puffing out clouds of ash. I can't believe how calm the locals are, living in the shadow of an active volcano. This used to be samurai territory and the bus whisks us off to a clan center to learn about how Japan, dominated by shoguns, was almost completely cut off from the outside world until 1867. Even now, it hasn't quite abandoned the old ways, for while our first night was spent slumbering in a rural siding on the train, for our second night the bus transfers us to the Gajyoen ryokan, a traditional travelers' inn in a hot springs resort an hour inland from Kagoshima. This ryokan turns out to be a rustic collection of low-beamed cottages threaded by cobbled pathways, with dinner prepared over charcoal using ingredients from the garden. My room has sweet-smelling tatami-matting floors, and I plan to sleep on the balcony overlooking the river until I return from dinner to find that the bed fairies have been at work, magicking a linen-covered futon out onto the sleeping room floor. I don't ignore the balcony, however, because this is where I have my own personal onsen. Luxuriating in my own floating world,  contemplating the evening light filtering through the trees, it is easy to see the sense in this change of scene away from the Seven Stars: the proper savoring of hot springs is a very Japanese experience, and not one that should be curtailed by the timetable of even the most handsome of trains. Need to know info: . The Seven Stars offers two itineraries: a two-day option which stays around Fukuoka, or a four-day journey which does a loop of the island. Both are hugely in demand, so the company selects applications by lottery. The starting price of $4,200 per person (based on two sharing) covers all accommodation, transport, sightseeing, food and drink. Fukuoka airport has direct flights to Asian capitals such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai with carriers JAL, Cathay Pacific and ANA, and direct to Europe with KLM to Amsterdam.

"Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu lost her Senate runoff race Saturday night, felled by the red tide that's swept the South and ties to an unpopular President that she couldn't shake. CNN called the race for her Republican opponent Rep. Bill Cassidy a little over a half hour after the polls closed. Republicans picked up nine Senate seats this election cycle and will have control of 54 seats in the chamber next year. Once seen as Democrats' strongest incumbent, Landrieu ended up such a long-shot in her runoff with Cassidy that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee cut its investment in the state, a move that Landrieu decried as leaving ""a soldier on the field."" In her concession speech, Landrieu touted her own ""record of courage, honesty and integrity and delivering for the state when it mattered the most."" The senator also said she didn't regret her vote for Obamacare, which the GOP used to attack her and every other vulnerable Democratic senator this cycle. ""This is something to be proud of, and I'm glad we fought for it,"" she said, touting some of the benefits of the law. ""Shake it Off,"" Taylor Swift's pop anthem to moving past defeat and ignoring critics, played as Landrieu hugged the staff and family members gathered on the stage. And tears could be seen throughout the crowd as the event wound down on Saturday night. An energetic Cassidy, meanwhile, opened his victory speech with a surprised, ""whoa!"" He told his supporters his win was the ""exclamation point"" on the declaration that ""we want our country to go in a conservative direction,"" which was made with the GOP's resounding wins on Nov. 4. He was introduced at his victory party by GOP Sen. David Vitter, who endorsed the congressman and has been active in the race for him. And Cassidy was joined on stage by his onetime GOP foe in the race, retired Air Force colonel Rob Maness, who ran as a conservative alternative to him during the first round of voting but endorsed him in the runoff. Landrieu ran hard through the very end, insisting even Saturday morning, outside the school where she cast her ballot, that there was still a shot. Landrieu, any Democrat in Louisiana will remind you, had pulled off stunning upsets before. And a late-breaking controversy surrounding Cassidy's part-time work for Louisiana State University gave Democrats some hope that they could damage him in the final moments of the race. But the controversy came too late to pick up much traction, despite Landrieu hammering him at campaign stops throughout the week on it. Landrieu's campaign pitch centered around her clout in the Senate, and what she can do for the state in Washington. But that argument lost much of its potency on Nov. 4, when Democrats lost the Senate and Landrieu could no longer tout a committee chairmanship. And Landrieu was never able to effectively localize the race and distance herself from the president, while Republicans tied her to him at every opportunity. Indeed, even Landrieu's supporters seemed to know it was over before Election Night. Andrea Neighbours, a supporter at the party, was visibly disappointed when told the race had been called for Cassidy. But she admitted: ""Well, it was coming."" And Cassidy ran a largely error-free, if exceptionally safe, campaign. He held infrequent campaign stops during the runoff and stayed entirely out of the state for the final week of the runoff, returning only for a Monday debate and two rallies Friday. On Saturday, he was taking a professional development course at the hospital where he works. But a troupe of volunteers were out Saturday across the state canvassing for him. An army of GOP operatives descended on the runoff, many of whom came to the state after finishing top races elsewhere in the nation. The Republican National Committee had around 300 staffers in the state and used the runoff period as a testing ground for field and data methods. And GOP groups supporting Cassidy bombarded Landrieu with millions in attack ads, while a handful of small Democratic groups spent less than half a million for her in the runoff. Republicans wanted, they said, to put an ""exclamation mark"" on their wins on Nov. 4. Even Landrieu's deep familiarity with the state and family name couldn't save her. Moon Landrieu, the senator's father, is a popular former mayor of New Orleans, and Mitch, her brother, is the city's current mayor. Landrieu canvassed the neighborhood surrounding her father's home on Satuday, much of which is home to low-income and African American residents. She stopped at 66-year-old Aida Gray's house, just a few blocks away from her family's, to shake hands and ask if she would be heading to the polls. Gray later said that of course she would, because she had known the senator for decades. ""She's a good person, and she'd make a better senator than Cassidy,"" she said. But despite her belief that Landrieu was the best candidate for the job, Gray acknowledged the odds were stacked against the senator. ""It's in God's hands now,"" she said.","Rep. Bill Cassidy, a Republican, won Louisiana's runoff Saturday night .

"A half-dozen men considered prisoners in the U.S. war on terror until yesterday now have a new designation -- refugees -- and a new temporary home: Uruguay. A U.S. medical aircraft carrying the six former Guantanamo Bay detainees landed at a military base in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, in the middle of the night, CNN affiliate Canal 10 Uruguay reported on Sunday. Within a few hours, a caravan of 15 to 20 vehicles, including ambulances, drove the newly freed men to hospitals. The U.S. Defense Department confirmed the transfer Sunday and said it coordinated with the government of Uruguay to make sure the transfers took place with adequate security and with humane treatment. ""The United States is grateful to the government of Uruguay for its willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility,"" the department said. GOP congressman: We 'ought to rethink' Gitmo transfer policy . ""We have offered our hospitality for humans suffering a heinous kidnapping in Guantanamo,"" Uruguayan President Jose Mujica wrote on his presidential website on Friday. ""The unavoidable reason is humanitarian."" Four of the former detainees -- Ahmed Adnan Ahjam, Ali Hussain Shaabaan, Omar Mahmoud Faraj, and Jihad Diyab -- are Syrian nationals, while Abdul Bin Mohammed Abis Ourgy is Tunisian, and Mohammed Tahanmatan is Palestinian, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said Sunday. Canal 10 reported that the United Nations refugee agency will be responsible for returning the released prisoners to their homes. Their transfers to Uruguay were unanimously approved by the United States' Guantanamo Review Task Force, which represents six departments and agencies. The review was prompted by an executive order issued by President Barack Obama shortly after his inauguration in January 2009. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel informed Congress of the intent to transfer the six men, the Defense Department said. Saturday's transfers leave only 136 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, out of more than 750. That's the lowest number of inmates at the base in Cuba since detainees started arriving in 2002. What happens when detainees leave Guantanamo Bay? At least seven detainees have died in custody over the years. In Mujica's open letter, he also called for the United States to lift its embargo on Cuba and release some Cubans and Puerto Ricans he called political prisoners.","Prisoners are transferred in the middle of the night, then taken to hospitals .

"Former President George W. Bush has a number of accomplishments under his belt: Texas governor, U.S. president, and now, a New York Times best-selling author. But even though Bush's book about his father -- ""41: A Portrait of My Father"" -- has been No. 1 on the Times' nonfiction sellers list for weeks, Bush admits the book isn't exactly a historical biography. ""It's a love story,"" Bush told Candy Crowley on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I'm not the least bit ashamed to say it's not very objective,"" he added.

"(CNN)Three billion miles away from Earth, in an unchartered slice of our solar system, a small space probe is shaking off its deep sleep and getting ready to become the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons. It's the ""beginning of the mission's primary objective: the exploration of Pluto and its many moons in 2015,"" said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado, in a NASA news release. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft was launched on January 19, 2006. It's down to the final 162 million miles of its journey and will arrive July 14, 2015. New Horizons has had 18 hibernation periods totaling 1,873 days to save wear and tear on its components. This was its last nap. Mission operators at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, say a preprogrammed command ordered the spacecraft to switch from hibernation to ""active"" at 9:53 p.m. (EST) December 6. ""This is a big deal. It means the start of our pre-encounter operations,"" said Glen Fountain, New Horizons project manager at APL. The mission managers will spend several weeks checking out the spacecraft and testing computer commands to guide New Horizons through the rest of its flight. The probe is 27 inches (0.7 meters) tall, 83 inches (2.1 meters) long and 108 inches (2.7 meters) wide. It weighed 1,054 pounds (478 kilograms) at launch. New Horizons is packed with cameras and other instruments, and it should start sending back glimpses of Pluto on January 15. By mid-May, we should get ""better than Hubble"" photos. Until now, the best image we've had of Pluto is a pixilated photo from the Hubble Space Telescope. We'll also see Pluto's five moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. New Horizons was launched before the big debate started over whether it's a planet. For the scientists on the New Horizons team, Pluto is very much a planet -- just a new kind of planet. ""New Horizons is on a journey to a new class of planets we've never seen, in a place we've never been before,"" says New Horizons Project Scientist Hal Weaver of APL. ""For decades, we thought Pluto was this odd little body on the planetary outskirts; now we know it's really a gateway to an entire region of new worlds in the Kuiper Belt, and New Horizons is going to provide the first close-up look at them.""

"Liverpool striker Luis Suarez has been found guilty of racially abusing a Manchester United player in October, the English Football Association announced on Tuesday. The Uruguay international was suspended for eight matches and fined £40,000 ($63,000) after a seven-day hearing by an independent regulatory commission. He has 14 days to appeal the punishment, the FA said. Manchester United's Patrice Evra, who is black, said the word Suarez shouted repeatedly during the October 15 Premier League match was a racial slur and demanded that Suarez be held accountable. Liverpool issued a statement saying it was ""very surprised and disappointed"" with the decision. Blog: Footballers are TV stars, and should act like it ... ""We find it extraordinary that Luis can be found guilty on the word of Patrice Evra alone when no-one else on the field of play -- including Evra's own Manchester United teammates and all the match officials -- heard the alleged conversation between the two players,"" the club said. ""We will study the details reasons of the commission once they become available, but reserve our right to appeal or take any other course of action we feel appropriate with regards to this situation."" Suarez did not specify what he said, but has previously said it wasn't offensive. ""I didn't insult him. It was only a form of expressing myself. I called him something his own teammates from Manchester call him,"" Suarez said, according to the Uruguayan newspaper El Pais. One word with many meanings translates into sports controversy . British media reports suggested Suarez used the term ""negrito."" Scholars who have studied race issues in Latin America say that such a term can have different meanings and connotations in different nations. Generally, however, negrito is not considered a racial slur in Latin America, said Mark Sawyer, director of the Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics at the University of California Los Angeles. ""It's often a term of endearment,"" he said. But Dr. Carmen Fracchia, a Paraguayan who works in the Iberian and Latin American Studies department of Birkbeck University of London, told CNN that the term is not affectionate when it refers to strangers. In a post on his Facebook page shortly after the match, Suarez said he was upset by the allegations. ""I can only say that I have always respected and respect everybody,"" he said. ""We are all the same. I go to the field with the maximum (enthusiasm) of a little child who enjoys what he does, not to create conflicts."" Evra, who is a Senegal-born French citizen, said in an interview with France's Canal Plus that evidence supported his claim. ""There are cameras,"" the former France national team captain said. ""You can see him say a certain word to me at least 10 times. There is no place for that in 2011."" The commission found that Suarez ""used insulting words towards Mr. Evra"" and that those words ""included a reference to Mr. Evra's color,"" the FA statement said. Liverpool noted that in his written statement, even Evra said he did not believe Suarez is racist. ""Luis himself is of a mixed-race family background, as his grandfather was black,"" the club said. It noted that Suarez has been involved since the 2010 World Cup in ""a charitable project which uses sport to encourage solidarity amongst people of different backgrounds with the central theme that the colour of a person's skin does not matter ... We do not recognize the way in which Luis Suarez has been characterized."" The club said it believes the FA was ""determined to bring charges against Luis Suarez, even before interviewing him at the beginning of November. Nothing we have heard in the course of the hearing has changed our view that Luis Suarez is innocent of the charges against him and we will provide Luis with whatever support he now needs to clear his name.""","Suarez's eight-match ban and fine is suspended pending any appeal .

"(CNN)Close your eyes and imagine the ""center"" of America. What do you see? Is it the rolling plains of Kansas, or Manhattan's field of skyscrapers? The foggy Golden Gate, or a gated community? Lately, all I can see is Ferguson, the now-famous Missouri town where, in August, a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown. It's a place no one had heard of a year ago but now finds itself at the center of the news cycle, at the center of our national attention and at the center of a new and profound sense of worry that racial injustice may long divide us still. But the national focus is always shifting. Not far from Ferguson -- 167.8 miles to be exact -- is a place that, by definition, is a different kind of ""center"" of the country -- the statistical mean center of population. That probably sounds meaningless, but, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it's the place ""where an imaginary, flat, weightless and rigid map of the United States would balance perfectly if all residents were of identical weight."" The spot has moved west and south as Americans themselves have pushed out of the 13 Colonies and, now, into the desert Southwest. The dot, in that narrow sense, tells a particular part of our national story. And, as of 2010, that spot rests in Plato, Missouri. Population: 109. Plato's demographics mirror neither Ferguson's nor the nation's. In a country that is becoming increasingly diverse (whites no longer will be in the majority by 2043, according to the census), Plato is almost completely Caucasian. The nation is urbanizing (81% of Americans live urban areas, according to the 2010 census, up from 79% in 2000); Plato, meanwhile, is about as rural as they come. When I visited the town in 2011 for a CNN story, I clocked a drive across town at 1 minute and 9 seconds, and that's assuming you're obeying the 40-mph speed limit. In other words: Plato isn't America, but it's still part of America. This paradox -- what does this almost-random place say about the rest of us? -- is what drew me to the tiny town for a story on a Census Bureau ceremony that designated the town as our national population center. It's also what captivated New York photographer Benjamin Hoste, who has visited Plato at least nine times in recent years. He plans to keep going back until about 2020, when the mean population center will change, likely moving to the west in tow with itinerant Americans. I got a chance to talk by phone with Hoste recently, and you can see some of his photos from the project in the gallery above. We spoke before the protests broke out in Ferguson and across the nation following a grand jury's decision not to indict the officer who shot Brown. Maybe that's just as well because Hoste told me he aimed to take ""timeless"" photos of Plato: There is a photo of a boy laying on the grass by a trailer tire, for example, and a portrait of Bob Morgan, now deceased, holding two of his walking sticks. When I asked Hoste who the most interesting person in Plato was, his first of several replies was Morgan, who he said was a World War II veteran and cowboy. Morgan was building barns and bending metal into his 80s, Hoste told me. Just an ordinary, hard-working dude. Maybe it seems quaint in this time of turmoil. But this place, like Ferguson, is part of our story. That seems to be part of Hoste's assertion with these photos. He told me he's still trying to figure out in what ways Plato is and isn't relevant to our national identity -- or if any one place can actually be a microcosm for a nation of 316 million. Plato, I'll remind you, is home to 109. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. When he first visited Plato, Hoste said he was struck by the fact that it appeared to be a town that ""doesn't really have a center."" ""There's no real middle of the town,"" he said, other than maybe the school, which is a community rallying point. The same could be said of America. This is the age of the 99% and the 1% -- red and blue, black and white. We've always been a country divided, but those divisions seem to be especially visible now -- particularly the income gap, which has been widening since the 70s; the race gap; and, importantly, the underlying empathy gap. Maybe that's where Plato has something humble but important to contribute to our national conversation. This is a place, according to Hoste, where people still talk to each other -- where they care about each other, and where they're willing to debate sensitive issues. Hoste is from the Los Angeles area and now lives in New York. His politics lean left, where Plato's are solidly right. Visiting Plato might have seemed like stepping into a foreign country. Except it was surprisingly easy for him to gel there. ""Their values are the same as my values,"" he told me. ""They're very interested in trying to support their families. They're interested in having a good education for their children. They're interested in having some support for when they retire."" Imagine that.

"(CNN) -- Can chicken breasts help beat breast cancer? KFC officials are hoping customers will flock to help the chicken chain make a record-breaking donation of $8.5 million. But some critics are calling foul on the company's mixed message, especially in light of the recent, heavily publicized addition of the aggressively fat-and-sodium laden Double Down sandwich to their menu. KFC's ""Buckets for the Cure"" initiative boasts a bright pink website, packed with breast cancer facts, survivor stories and a pledge to donate 50 cents from each specially branded pink bucket of their grilled or Original Recipe chicken to Susan G. Komen for the Cure. The Komen organization funds research grants and community-based outreach projects focused on breast health education, screening and treatment. The KFC site's stated goal is to make the largest single donation in history toward Komen's efforts with combined individual and KFC corporate contributions during the campaign that runs until May 5. Sounds like something to crow about, right? Not according to New York University professor Marion Nestle, who maintains the Food Politics website. ""OK, scientists are still arguing about the dietary determinants of breast cancer and aren't too worried about fat, but they do worry about body weight,"" the professor of nutrition, food studies and public health posted on her blog. ""Maintaining a healthy body weight is still the first recommendation of the American Cancer Society, for example."" The Food and Fitness section of ACS's website warns, ""Being overweight or obese increases the risk of several cancers, including cancers of the breast (among women past menopause)..."" Nestle tells CNN, ""The goals of food companies, alas, are not the same as the goals of public health. Food companies are businesses that must sell expanding numbers of products. While it seems possible that their goals and those of public health could overlap, they rarely do. Buckets for the Cure gets money for whatever it does. KFC sells more buckets. Sounds good, if you don't think about it too much."" However, KFC officials tell CNN that they're sensitive to conscientious customers. KFC's Rick Maynard said, ""We have something for everyone, including people who are counting calories for health reasons."" ""Last year, we introduced Kentucky Grilled Chicken, which has fewer calories, fewer fat grams and less sodium that our Original Recipe chicken. Kentucky Grilled Chicken is the product that is featured in our commercial for 'Buckets for the Cure,' and we are seeing lots of customers ask for pink buckets filled with KGC."" It is the bucket color that is troubling Barbara Brenner, executive director of Breast Cancer Action, an organization that calls itself a watchdog group seeking to compel the changes to end breast cancer. She tells CNN that her group believes the KFC campaign is based in ""pinkwashing"" -- putting a pink, cancer-awareness ribbon on products that are bad for health. Her beef isn't just with the chicken chain, though; it's with the Komen Foundation. ""This will keep them (Komen) in business for years. They talk about a cure, but this this partnership will create more breast cancer. And Komen knows this,"" said Brenner on the assumed relationship between fast food, excess weight and cancer risk. Brenner went on to say, ""Komen puts the responsibility for health in individuals' hands, but some people don't have the option to take care of themselves. Say you don't have the money or choice -- KFC is making money in the poorest communities."" Komen's director of communication, Andrea Rader, tells CNN the claims are ""ludicrous."" ""These partnerships go a long way toward supporting education and direct care for over 1,900 communities across the country. These programs provide mammograms to women in low-income communities,"" Rader said. ""And people are still operating under old and crazy myths -- people ask us if they can get cancer from wearing a underwire bra. There is not enough awareness out there,"" she says. As to Brenner's claims, Rader says, ""It's insane to say that we're exploiting poor people, and there's a logical flaw in that argument. Healthier choices are available on the menu. Are they saying that poorer people won't make them?"" Rader added the Komen Foundation seeks to add $20 million in funding for cancer prevention research this year, atop the $50 million they've previously invested. ""Buckets for the Cure"" website states, albeit at the very bottom, that individual consumer purchases will not directly increase the total donation -- rather that the money is determined by purchases of buckets by KFC restaurant operators. Despite the controversy, it seems franchisees have been flocking to help out. The campaign has thus far raised more than $2 million dollars.","KFC launches effort to raise donations through pink buckets of chicken .

"Raw milk from Utah has sickened 45 people, according to the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food. The cases of campylobacteriosis have been linked to raw milk or cream purchased at Ropelato Dairy in Weber County, the department said in a statement Tuesday. Most of the infections occurred in people from Utah counties, though two were out-of-state residents from California and Idaho. Inspectors suspended the dairy's license to sell raw milk on August 4, after samples taken at the farm tested positive for campylobacter bacteria. ""What we've discovered is that an employee had not been thoroughly cleaning the udders of the cows,"" Larry Lewis with the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food told CNN affiliate KSL. ""That is introducing contamination, manure and feces that are in that area into the milk, which is a major problem."" Campylobacteriosis is a common bacterial infection that causes diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts estimate it affects over 1.3 million Americans every year, with more cases happening during the summer months. The illness typically lasts around a week, though some people with the bacteria don't experience any symptoms at all. Most patients recover without treatment. People with weakened immune systems, such as infants or the elderly, are most at risk for a serious infection. ""In some severe cases, illness can lead to complications, including paralysis and death,"" Utah epidemiologist Kenneth Davis said. ""If you have recently consumed raw milk and are experiencing any of these symptoms, contact your health care provider."" Campylobacteriosis is generally associated with consuming raw or undercooked poultry or dairy products, according to the CDC. ""Unpasteurized milk can become contaminated if the cow has an infection with Campylobacter in her udder or if the milk is contaminated with manure,"" the health agency's site states. Since 2009, there have been 14 documented outbreaks of campylobacteriosis associated with raw milk in Utah, according to the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food, with more than 200 people becoming ill. Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized, or heated briefly, to kill harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli and campylobacter. Heat can affect a few of the vitamins -- thiamine, vitamin B12 and vitamin C -- that are found in milk, according to the CDC, but it ""does not significantly change the nutritional value."" The U.S Food and Drug Administration warns consumers against drinking raw milk or eating dairy products made with raw milk. ""Many people believe that foods with no or minimal processing are better for their health,"" the CDC says. ""Many people also believe that small, local farms are better sources of healthy food. However, some types of processing are needed to protect health.""","45 campylobacteriosis cases have been linked to raw milk from a Utah dairy farm .

"(CNN) -- I get it. Raven-Symone doesn't like labels. But she is wrong to run away from her blackness, seemingly hoping that no one acknowledges her beautiful brown skin and the history written all over her face. ""I'm tired of being labeled. I'm an American. I'm not an African-American. I'm an American."" The former star of ""The Cosby Show"" and ""That's so Raven"" told Oprah Winfrey. ""I mean, I don't know where my roots go to. I don't know how far back they go. ... I don't know what country in Africa I'm from, but I do know that my roots are in Louisiana. I'm an American, and that's a colorless person, because we're all people. I have lots of things running through my veins."" Many of us have been exactly where she is, struggling to fit in. Trying to be ""colorless"" when there's no way to look at someone without noticing appearance. And that includes color. But Raven's dilemma is part of the black experience in America. Our identity is not really a matter of choice. Black people were forefathers of this nation: slaves, soldiers, scholars and dedicated women and men who helped create these United States of America. For me, rejecting your blackness is downright un-American. The two words are inseparable. Being black equals being American. So no matter how she tries to deny us, Raven is still ours, still black in the eyes of her community. And we remain proud of her. Proud and patient because we understand how the heavy burden of labels can crush your spirit and get in the way of your dreams. I've struggled all my life with the weight of labels. They pop up at the most awkward times: introductions at work meetings, compliments over dinner, amongst friends and foes. Sometimes it feels like society is at once confused, intrigued and resentful of my blackness. And I'm certain that black woman are described with more adjectives than anyone on the planet: Black woman, African-American, bossy, strong black woman, articulate black woman, working mother, black entrepreneur, black single mother, straight ally, LGBT-friendly, divorcee, feminist, liberal and now even black-ish woman. When I was younger it was a latchkey kid, project kid, kid from a broken home. One of my favorite is La Negrita. The first time I visited Central America and heard a local call me that name, I immediately went into my Angry Black Woman mode. It took a few minutes to calm down and understand that in Latin America, La Negrita is a term of endearment, a compliment meaning something closer to beautiful black woman. Who knew? There's even a national holiday in Costa Rica called ""DÃ­a de la Negrita."" ""I bet your country would never have a holiday honoring black women,"" a friend in Costa Rica joked one day, when I asked her why everyone was celebrating. No, I had to agree. We are a long way from that day. I'm not sure when this notion first clicked for me, that you cannot be black in this nation without also claiming your American-ness. Maybe it was years ago after my great-aunt Rosie showed me a photo in our family album of one of my ancestors gallantly posed in his Civil War uniform. That soldier was a black American. Or, when my aunt talked with pride about her father who couldn't read or write in any language but was a successful French chef in the South. That chef was a black American. Or, perhaps things became clear when my grandfather stood tall and told me about how proud he was to fight for his country, despite segregation. Now, Grandpop wasn't a fancy, highly educated man. He never could imagine the glamorous Hollywood lifestyle of Raven-Symone. Truth be told, he was in slightly in awe of my career in ""this journalism stuff."" Unfortunately, he died before seeing a black family in the White House. Now that would have really tickled him. But Grandpop always believed hard work and education could get you places in this world. He spent his life toiling in the bowels of our nation's first Trident submarines, fitting those vessels with nuclear missiles. It was backbreaking work. He would take me to tour those subs and boast about America's global power. He retired after nearly 50 years with a broken body but a proud heart for doing his part to keep America strong. My grandfather was a black American. No matter what label the world may choose to describe me, one thing I never doubt is that I am a strong black American woman, whose heart beats with the African and Caribbean blood of my ancestors. Knowing this gives me strength, courage and joy every day of my life. I cannot imagine ever separating myself from all of the courageous people who came before me to break down barriers, share their wisdom and pave the way so my journey is just a little bit smoother in this life. And in spite of her protests when Raven looks back just a bit, she'll understand: She is also, among other things, a black American.","Raven-Symone hates labels and wants to be called American, not black American .
Roxanne Jones says Symone is wrong: Being black equals being American .

"You might call it ""stemwaregate"", a seemingly extravagant luxury purchase by the U.S. Department of State just before the federal government partially shuts down. A contract worth as much as $5 million was awarded to high-end Vermont glass and pottery designer Simon Pearce to design and manufacture glass stemware for U.S. foreign embassies just days before the October 1st government shutdown. State Department spokesperson Marie Harf sought Wednesday to downplay the story. ""[T]here was no sort of $5 million midnight purchase trying to get it just in under the wire,"" she said. ""This contract was not connected in any way to the shutdown."" But Harf did acknowledge the contract, which was awarded September 25, coincided with the end of the government's fiscal year, at which time many agencies incorporate a ""use it or lose it"" mentality with their funding. A spokesperson for Simon Pearce told CNN the contract is for 12,500 pieces of custom hand-blown glassware to be produced over five years and to be used at foreign embassies. Simon Pearce stemware isn't cheap -- starting at $65 per piece.  But the spokeswoman said the government has negotiated a ""significant reduction"" in price due to the volume order. The company spokesperson said Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy was instrumental in securing the contract. Simon Pearce expects the contract to allow it to hire many additional workers at its Quechee facility, which was nearly destroyed by Hurricane Irene two years ago.

"You may have noticed an interesting reaction when you tell people you're traveling to Amsterdam.  They sometimes get that curious look, that knowing half-smile on their faces. ""Amsterdam,"" they say with a mischievous grin, ""lucky you!"" Are they thinking about Van Gogh and Rembrandt, about the fabulous museums, the flowing canals, the teeming bicycle paths, the gorgeous tulips -- or is it something else? To many, Amsterdam is synonymous with freedom. With the ability to do what is forbidden in other places. Throwback lodging: Stay in another era . Undoubtedly, millions travel to the Netherlands to see the just re-opened Rijksmuseum and its famous ""Night Watch"" painting, along with many other attractions of this truly charming city. But, let's face it, Amsterdam conjures another fascination. Decades before anyone else considered legalizing marijuana, prostitution or gay marriage, the Dutch stood -- as they still do today -- at the forefront of change on many controversial social issues, legalizing or tolerating a range of activities that other countries placed squarely outside what they consider legally and socially acceptable. That is not to say other countries did not have recreational drugs, homosexuality and prostitution. But the Dutch, with their history of practicality and compromise, decided to deal with these matters in a pragmatic way. In the process, they created a whole new world for tourists craving tolerance and a brush with the forbidden. Amsterdam remains a magnet for travelers who find the idea of smoking marijuana in public -- perhaps in front of a passing cop to add to the experience -- simply irresistible. Still, there are great misconceptions about what is and is not legal here. The picture of a hedonistic free-for-all is not altogether accurate. The Dutch are a people of rules and laws. Although they also have an interesting approach to certain issues, where the law says one thing and the official policy is to look the other way. 8 hotels still fresh at 100 . So what, precisely, is legal in the Netherlands? You may be surprised to learn that recreational drugs are illegal in the Netherlands. Yes, even pot. But an official policy of tolerance emerged and in 1976 the Dutch parliament decriminalized possession of less than 5 grams of cannabis. That gave rise to a type of establishment found only in this country. In hundreds of ""coffee shops"" across the country -- not to be confused with ""cafes"" where you, in fact, go for coffee -- you can select from a menu of cannabis products and light up in full view indoors or at a sidewalk table. It is the crowded, cloudy coffee shops that give Amsterdam its unmistakable summer aroma. The city is also home to countless seed shops, a hash and marijuana museum, and other businesses aimed at extracting cash from the peculiarly happy drug tourists. Things got a little complicated in 2008, when the Netherlands, as other countries, imposed restrictions on smoking in public places. A great battle ensued as coffee shop owners complained the ban would put them out of business. Dutch compromising ensued. So, today, you cannot smoke in most public establishments, but you can still smoke marijuana in a coffee shop. All non-medical drugs, to be clear, are illegal. But there are two categories. Cannabis and some types of ""recreational mushrooms"" are in a separate class; still illegal, but largely tolerated. The most powerful type of ""magic mushrooms,"" containing psilocybin, were made illegal in 2008, but authorities say they will not prosecute anyone holding very small quantities. Hashish is also in a gray area, up to each municipality to decide. Not everyone likes this openness. Weed tourism is controversial in some circles and there are worries that lax laws attract more than just the tattoos and scraggly beard crowd, encouraging drug traffickers to enter the market. Weed aficionados across parts of the world panicked a couple of years ago when a conservative government announced plans to stem drug tourism, partly as a result of friction with neighboring countries. Under the new rules, coffee shops would issue membership cards, Weed Passes, only to local residents. Foreigners would not be able to come to the Netherlands to get high. But, as coffee shop owners admit, it's not the Dutch who are lighting up. Ninety percent of the customers getting buzzed in Amsterdam are foreigners. Amsterdam authorities complained the plan would take a huge financial toll, as millions of visitors every year inhale the offerings of coffee shop menus. After a very Dutch debate on the pros and cons of the plan, the government rewrote the law, leaving it up to each city to decide on the rules. Amsterdam scrapped it, while Maastricht, on the border with Germany and Belgium, left the ban in place and imposed fines on coffee shop owners defying the ban on pot sales to foreigners. So, to recap: No cigarette smoking in public; yes to pot in small quantities, but not in Maastricht, and mushrooms are OK in very small quantities. Today, pot smokers can be found meandering aimlessly along Amsterdam's famous Red Light district, the warren of alleyways and canals where prostitutes rent small rooms and stand in their windows, bathed in the light of red lamps before potential customers and sightseers. Policemen pedal easily alongside visitors, keeping an eye on the scene. Prostitution and brothels have been legal in the Netherlands since 2000. Prostitutes are supposed to have work permits and enjoy the protections of the country's labor laws. Another area of controversy in which the Dutch moved swiftly to the fore of social change is gay marriage. The Netherlands was the first country to fully legalize marriage equality. In 2001, the world's first same-sex ceremony was conducted by then-Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen. You can't come to the Netherlands with your beloved to tie the knot, however: One of the partners has to be a Dutch resident. You can, however, share the city with the hundreds of thousands of Amsterdammers who ride their bicycles to and from work every day. The law does not require you to wear a helmet and practically no one does. You are, however, required to have a light and a bell on your bike. If you walk, make sure to stay out of the official bike lanes. If you choose to drive a car, it is illegal to use a mobile phone while you drive, and if you run into a bicycle, Dutch law places the responsibility on the driver of the car. So, if you go to a coffee shop, better not drive a car, or even a bicycle. Your friends are right. Lucky you if you've come to Amsterdam. It's a very special city. Whether or not you want to enjoy the freedom of Amsterdam, just remember there's much more to the Netherlands than coffee shops and red lights. And the Rijksmuseum is definitely worth a visit.","Recreational drugs are illegal in the Netherlands, but there's an official policy of tolerance .

"Every year, thousands of Hawaiian tourists choose the small residential town of Kailua over the hustle and bustle of larger resort towns. Even President Barack Obama and his family have made it their yearly holiday vacation destination. Located off the southeast coast of Hawaii, Kailua boasts beachfront properties overlooking pristine white sand beaches. But residents are now asking Hawaii's Tourism Authority to stop promoting the town as an overnight destination. ""We have a city ordinance that does not permit these short terms tourist rentals in residential areas,"" said Kailua Neighborhood Board  Chairman, Chuck Prentiss. He cited a Honolulu County land use ordinance approved in the 1980s. ""We are not against having tourists in the community. It is a nice community for them to come and see. It has a nice beach and everything, but it is not proper to have a residential community used for overnight accommodations,""  Prentiss said. A move to slow tourism . In September, the Kailua Neighborhood Board approved a motion asking the Tourism Authority ""to respect the zoning and quality of life of our residential neighborhoods, and immediately stop promoting Kailua as a tourist destination and an alternative to Waikiki."" Waikiki, on the south of the island, is home to several high-end hotels and a lively night scene. The board's resolution was a response to a page on the Tourism Authority's website promoting Kailua's short-term rentals for families and large groups. ""We want them to take it off their website,"" Prentiss said. The problem, he said, is that most of these short terms rentals are illegal. In October, Hawaii's Tourism Authority's President Mike McCartney sent a letter to Prentiss in response to the board's request. ""Ultimately, the decision of what is appropriate land use policy must be determined by the county itself. However, the HTA does not encourage or promote illegal vacation rentals that are not properly licensed,"" the letter read. Prentiss did not consider that a ""satisfactory response."" McCartney estimates Kailua visitors have an economic impact of $103 million a year in revenue for the town. ""It's about our collective existence and how we live and work in our island home to find the right balance,"" McCartney said. Prentiss response: ""they seem to be fixed on increasing tourism at any cost."" Tourism is her livelihood . But for Bonnie Madigan, the cost would be her livelihood. She is the owner of Under a Hula Moon, a boutique in Kailua that sells furnishings with beach appeal. She said 80% of her business comes from tourists. ""Take the tourist away and I'm gone,"" said Madigan, who is also a resident of Kailua. ""They don't understand the reality."" ""I'm pro-tourism and I'm pro change. Change is part of life,"" she said. ""We are a beautiful place, it is a jewel. Why should we hoard it for ourselves, I think that is wrong."" The battle goes on . A quick web search for short terms rental properties in Kailua returned over 250 properties. Of these, Prentiss said, only 65 are legal -- properties that were grandfathered after the zoning ordinance was passed. ""We have a general plan for the island that designates the tourist sites and residential areas,"" Prentiss said.  ""We have people trying to live their lives in residential communities without being thrust into tourist areas."" Prentiss said the lack of oversight has resulted in other problems for Kailua residents such as increased property taxes, a rise in criminal activity and noise complaints. ""Tourists are on a different schedule than residents, it is incompatible with residential living,"" Prentiss said. The Kailua Neighborhood Board has brought up the issue of illegal short term rentals to the city and the county of Honolulu, but due to the lack of staffing, it has been difficult to enforce the ordinance, Prentiss said. The board plans to re-take the issue in its next meeting in January.","Kailua boasts beachfront properties overlooking pristine white sand beaches .

"Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faced more than two dozen survivors of that attack Wednesday as he pleaded not guilty to killing four people and wounding more than 200. Tsarnaev is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the April 15 attack, when a pair of bombs went off near the finish line of the packed course. Three people died in the blasts, including an 8-year-old boy, while a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer was killed three days later at the start of the dramatic chase that led to Tsarnaev's capture. MIT police lined up outside the courthouse as the hearing neared its end Wednesday afternoon in a show of solidarity with their fallen comrade, Sean Collier. Inside, about 30 survivors of the attack watched as Tsarnaev appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler. It was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest. The 19-year-old was dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit, his hair long and shaggy, his left arm in a cast. He was wounded in the pursuit -- during which his brother, Tamerlan, was killed -- and he appeared to have an injury to the left side of his face. Tsarnaev looked back at the spectators in the packed courtroom before entering his plea -- and to Liz Norden, whose two sons each had a leg amputated after the attacks, he appeared to smirk. ""He did have some family members in the courtroom, so I don't know,"" Norden told CNN. ""But to me it was, like, no remorse whatsoever."" Suspect: Boston attack was payback for hits on Muslims . Norden said her sons ""really don't want to hear about it,"" but she said she had to be in court for them. ""I want to see what happened to my family that day,"" she said. ""I watch my boys struggle every day, and it breaks my heart. And I just want to see who or why it happened and who caused it."" Tsarnaev faces a total of 30 federal charges in the bombings and subsequent pursuit through the streets of suburban Boston. He appeared in court for arraignment. Prosecutors said Wednesday they expect to call between 80 and 100 witnesses in a three- to four-month trial. Tsarnaev was found in a motorboat dry-docked in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home, covered in blood from bullet wounds sustained during a manhunt that brought Boston to a standstill. Victims and their families tend to appear in person at trials at two key moments, said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan: at the arraignment and at the verdict and sentencing. ""It's not something they want to watch on television. They want to be there,"" he said. The death penalty . Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino is confident about getting a conviction, he told the Boston Herald on Tuesday. ""We should lock him up and throw away the key."" But that won't be enough for many victims and their families. And prosecutors will likely go for the death penalty. Seventeen of the charges offer that possibility. Last bombing victim leaves hospital . Callan said Tsarnaev's lawyers could argue that he was under the ""mesmerizing influence"" of Tamerlan, his older brother. But Callan believes one piece of evidence will make it easy for prosecutors to shoot down that argument: While he lay bleeding in the motorboat, covered with a tarp, the younger Tsarnaev apparently scrawled his motive for his alleged deeds onto its sides. ""The U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians,"" it read. ""I can't stand to see such evil unpunished."" ""We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."" ""Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said (unintelligible) it is allowed."" Timeline: The bombing, manhunt and investigation . ""Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop."" ""That would indicate that he was not under his brother's influence, that he had an independent thought process and dedication to this movement on his own,"" Callan said. Prosecutors will use the writings to argue intent -- that Tsarnaev knew what he was doing. Indictment blow by blow . Tsarnaev is charged with killing three spectators in the bombings and a MIT police officer ambushed in his cruiser a few days later. He also is accused of ""maiming, burning and wounding scores of others,"" U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz has said. But that is merely a handful of the charges. Add to those use of a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, deadly bombing of a public place, use of a firearm during a crime of violence causing death, carjacking, bodily harm. The list goes on. The indictment details the planning that allegedly went into the attacks. Tamerlan Tsarnaev bought 48 mortars, it says. It also says that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev downloaded a copy of Inspire magazine, which included instructions on building IEDs using pressure cookers and explosive powder from fireworks. Pressure cooker bombs were used in the Boston Marathon attacks. Three days after the attacks, on April 18, the FBI released photographs of the brothers, identifying them as bombing suspects. Hours later, they drove their Honda Civic to the MIT campus, where they shot and killed Collier and attempted to steal his service weapon, the indictment says. They were allegedly armed with five IEDs, a Ruger P95 semiautomatic handgun, ammunition, a machete and a hunting knife. The indictment alleges that late that night, the brothers carjacked a Mercedes in Boston using guns. Soon after, police discovered the Tsarnaevs at an intersection in nearby Watertown, where they tried to apprehend them, but the brothers fired at the police and used four IEDs against them, the 74-page indictment alleges. Police tackled the elder brother and were trying to handcuff him when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev got back into the Mercedes and drove it at the officers, according to the indictment. He wound up running over his brother, ""contributing to his death."" The younger Tsarnaev escaped, abandoned the car nearby and hid in the boat, where he remained until the owner noticed him and called police. Health improved . In late May, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was allowed to have a phone conversation with his mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, who lives in the Russian republic of Dagestan. She recorded it and played it back to CNN affiliate ITN, based in Britain. She asked whether he was in pain. ""No, of course not.

"When Apple CEO Tim Cook takes the stage Wednesday in San Francisco, presumably to introduce the world to the iPhone 5, everyone knows what's going to happen. As a company that has honed image-making to a multi-billion-dollar science, Apple has drafted a detailed playbook for its product announcements. The stagecraft rarely, if ever, strays from that tried-and-true script. Invited journalists and others will crowd into an auditorium decorated with cryptic banners teasing something vaguely exciting. Some edgy but accessible rock, from the counterculture whine of Dylan to the indie stylings of The Shins, will greet the audience as they settle into their seats. Then the show starts. ""Tim Cook will tell us all about Apple,"" said Rene Ritchie, editor-in-chief of iMore, an Apple-centric blog focused on mobile devices. ""(Marketing vice president) Phil Schiller will come out and show us the new iPods. Then (vice president) Scott Forstall will come show us the software."" Finally, after almost an hour of mounting expectations, comes the big reveal. This time, it's going to be an iPhone 5, unless the company has perpetrated a hoodwinking of unprecedented proportions. Predictable? Yes. But, boring? Not in the eyes of  the hordes of Apple fanatics who will be hanging on every word. Because when perhaps the most secretive company in tech holds an event, everyone thinks they know what's going to happen -- but no one knows exactly what's going to happen. ""It's like the Super Bowl and the Oscars of technology all rolled into one,"" Ritchie said. A disciplined message . If that sounds over the top, consider the way then-CEO Steve Jobs unveiled a heretofore unknown device called the iPhone in 2007. Playing off of pre-event rumors, Jobs announced Apple would be indeed introducing a phone, along with a mobile internet device and ""the best iPod we've ever made."" ""Are you getting it?"" he finally said, after saying ""iPod,"" ""phone"" and ""internet communications device"" over and over again to an audience that had begun cheering like a college football crowd on game day. ""These are not three separate devices. This is one device."" In recent years, tech product launches have come to look pretty much the same. A senior executive with a wireless microphone paces back and forth across a stage, spouting hyperbole while slides show impressive sales figures or images of new products. But analysts say Apple has taken its stagecraft to a higher level. Jobs was famous at bringing emotion to his keynote talks and building anticipation for his ""One more thing ..."" surprise announcements of new products. ""Their discipline in how they deliver a message is extraordinary,"" said Van Baker, a research vice president at Gartner. ""All you got to do is contrast an Apple event with a Microsoft event. You go to an Apple event and they say three things and they reiterate it about three times and there's one more thing they throw in at the end. ""When everybody leaves an event they know exactly what was announced and they know exactly what they're supposed to take away from it and exactly what the message is."" Ritchie puts it another way. ""They tell you what they're going to tell you, they tell it to you, then they tell you what they told you."" The Apple events flip the script on the traditional ""don't bury the lead"" way of pushing out news. Instead of making the big announcement first, Cook and others likely will trot out a list of smaller news. The number of new Apple Stores opened. Updates to Mac and mobile operating systems. Freshen-ups on products like iPods or Apple TV. In an age of Twitter and live-blogging, it's a way to put details in front of the public that might otherwise get buried under the big news. But the minutiae disappears the moment the ramp-up to the big reveal begins. (There's some chance it might be ""reveals"" this week. In addition to the iPhone there's talk that a smaller ""iPad Mini"" might be on the way. With the iPhone 5 basically a foregone conclusion, that could be a candidate to be Cook's Jobsian ""One More Thing ... ."") The company hasn't been averse to a little schtick to help with those reveals, either. At times, Jobs would riff humorously at events like the 2002 ""funeral"" for Mac OS9 or his 1999 chat with HAL 9000 of ""2001"" fame. Oh, and about those cheering crowds: They're no accident either. ""They stock the front of the place with the Apple and Pixar people who are excited about it,"" Ritchie said. ""That's so carefully staged. It's laid out very carefully to create a story."" Reality distortion . It's all elaborately crafted, yet oh, so simple. ""In truth for anyone who's been through an MBA program, it's marketing 101,"" Baker said. ""But most companies, especially in the technology industry, just do not have the discipline to be able to do that ... . The vast majority of them are driven by an engineering culture rather than a marketing culture and they want to talk about everything that's in the product, and that leads to a dilution of the message."" The details of the formula have evolved over time. In Apple's earliest days, Jobs took the lead for entire events. But in recent years he began bringing in deputies such as Cook, Schiller and Forstall to share the stage -- in effect preparing a new generation of leaders. Observers jokingly (or in the case of some rivals, angrily) call the end effect of these events Apple's ""reality distortion field."" The level of excitement is infectious and the message is hammered home in a manner to which even normally skeptical tech journalists aren't immune. ""They sort of get you where they want you to be and then they spoon feed it to you ...,"" Ritchie said. ""It's easier for us to regurgitate it, whereas with other companies, they make you think about it and it's easier to scrutinize it."" The critiques of the products usually don't come until later, from outside the event hall. They have ranged from technical issues, such as the antenna problems on the iPhone 4, to light-hearted ruminations on whether more Apple engineers women in the room might have kept Apple's tablet from being called an ""iPad."" But for at least one news cycle, those more probing questions tend to get buried under a wave of breathless reports about Apple's event. ""It's almost like an exercise in Sun Tzu for business presentations,"" Ritchie said, referencing the ""Art of War"" author. Among the famous quotes from that ancient Chinese manual: ""All men can see these tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.""","The stagecraft of Apple events is predictable yet effective .
Observers say the company makes its message clear, hammering a few points .
In tech, many companies fail to follow Marketing 101 and get bogged down .
Orchestrated events help the company sell its message ."
"The start of the multiple murder trial of James Holmes -- the man accused of shooting dead 12 people inside an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater -- has been set for October 14, a courts spokesman said. Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos Samour set the trial date for Holmes, according to Colorado state courts spokesman Rob McCallum. Earlier this month, the same judge ordered an additional, independent sanity examination for Holmes that must be filed by July 14. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Holmes, who is accused of opening fire in a packed movie theater during a July 2012 midnight showing of the latest Batman installment, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Authorities have said Holmes was dressed head to toe in protective gear. He allegedly threw tear-gas canisters in the theater and then opened fire on the patrons, according to witnesses. Police say he used several weapons, including an AR-15 rifle, before fleeing the theater. Outside the theater, the shooter was apprehended, identifying himself to police as ""The Joker,"" one of Batman's archenemies. He faces 166 charges tied to the rampage.  He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors have argued that Holmes began plotting the attack while enrolled as a neuroscience doctoral student at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus, a program he left a month before the mass shooting. The defense, meanwhile, appears to be focused not so much on what Holmes allegedly did that night but his mental state then and earlier.","A Colorado judge sets an October 14 trial date for James Holmes .

"Boston (CNN)Hillary Clinton stood with those protesting the deaths of two unarmed black males at the hands of law enforcement on Thursday, telling an audience in Boston that ""our country deserves a full and fair accounting"" of what happened. In the last two weeks, grand juries have cleared police officers in the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. The deaths have led to rising tension and protests around the country about law enforcement's treatment of black males. At a massive gathering of 10,000 women in Massachusetts, Clinton said she recognized the ""pain and frustration"" in response to the deaths and backed federal probes that have been initiated by the Justice Department. ""I'm very pleased that the DOJ will be investigating what happened in Ferguson or Staten Island,"" Clinton said. ""Those families and those communities and our country deserve a full and fair accounting, as well as whatever substantive reforms are necessary to ensure equality, justice and respect for every citizen."" Clinton also called out the federal government for sending military-style equipment -- which Clinton called ""weapons of war"" -- to local police forces. Instead, the former secretary of state and likely 2016 presidential candidate said the United States should ""invest in what works ... [not] buy weapons of war that have no place on our streets or contribute to unnecessary force or arrests."" Earlier this week, President Barack Obama issued an executive order on police militarization calling for better tracking of such equipment. Clinton identified with both the peaceful protestors and law enforcement during her speech. ""We all know there are decent, honorable, brave police officers out in our communities every single day,"" Clinton said, before telling the audience the fact that African-American males are more likely to end up in prison than their white counterparts was a byproduct of an ""out of balance"" criminal justice system. ""Each of us has to grapple with some hard truths about race and justice in America,"" Clinton said. ""We have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance. And I personally hope that these tragedies give us the opportunity to come together as a nation to find our balance again."" Clinton last commented on Ferguson in August, a few weeks after Brown was shot dead by a police officer in the St. Louis suburb. The former first lady told an audience of technology investors in San Francisco that the United States ""can do better."" ""This is what happens when the bonds of trust and respect that hold any community together fray,"" Clinton said. ""Nobody wants to see our streets look like a war zone, not in America. We are better than that."" On Thursday, Clinton said in light of sweeping protests, people need to try ""even harder to see the world through our neighbors eyes."" ""Aren't these our sons? Aren't these our brothers?"" Clinton asked. ""These tragedies did not happen in some far away place. They did not happen to some other people. There are our streets, our children."" The venue for the commentary was somewhat unique. In a hall the size of multiple football fields, 10,000 women ate lunch and listened to Clinton talk at the Massachusetts Conference for Women. Outside the convention center hall a mix of corporations and shops were set up in booths to create what felt like a mix of a job fair and a mall. Women shopped for make up, scarfs and jewelry as they handed out resumes and got coached on how to buff up their LinkedIn page. Around the hall, there was excitement for Clinton. Many women chatted about her time on the speaking circuit and whether she would drop hints about her presidential plans on stage. Bentley University President Gloria Larson, who founded the gathering 10 years ago, event pondered the subject from stage. ""Do you think she might give us a few clues about her future plans today?"" she questioned to a chorus of cheers from the crowd. Clinton was not the only high-profile speaker on the stage Thursday. Lupita Nyong'o, the award-winning actress from the film ""12 Years a Slave,"" shared her story on overcoming her fears to become an actress. She also told the crowd she was honored for share the stage with Clinton, who she described as, ""literally a leader among men."" As for Clinton, she declined to say whether she was running, but did reflect on the presidency when asked, calling it ""such a hard job"" where a ""support system is absolutely critical."" It's unclear if Clinton was paid to speak at the event, though it had all the trappings of Clinton's usually paid appearances.","Hillary Clinton said Thursday the criminal justice system is ""out of balance""

"Republicans looking to fault Hillary Clinton hope the few hours the former secretary of state will spend in Las Vegas on Monday will remind voters of her less-than-perfect book roll-out and high-dollar speaking fees. Clinton, who starts her day in Denver for a fundraiser with Sen. Mark Udall, will make two appearances in Las Vegas on Monday. She will first headline a fundraiser for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at the Aria Hotel and Casino, then the former secretary of state will keynote a fundraiser or the The University of Nevada-Las Vegas Foundation at the swanky Bellagio. Republicans are seizing on the second speech, where Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for the Democrats' presidential nomination in 2016, will collect $225,000 for her appearance, according to event organizers. Although a Clinton spokesperson argues that the fee will go straight to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, the former first lady's appearance in Las Vegas on Monday was possibly the most controversial and widely talked about paid speech Clinton was set to give this year. ""Clinton's Nevada Pay Day,"" said an email from the Republican National Committee. ""As Clinton's Long-Awaited Silver State Pay Day Arrives, A Reminder Of The Troubles It Caused Her Would-Be Campaign."" ""The much anticipated Hillary UNLV speech reminds us that Hillary's exorbitant fees and travel requirements are going to be problematic on her run for the White House,"" RNC Press Secretary Kirsten Kukowski said in an email. When Clinton's appearance at the UNLV fundraiser was announced in June, students at the university protested the fact the foundation was spending money to bring Clinton in at the same time that their tuition was going up due to budget issues. ""In keeping with Secretary Clinton's long-standing history of advocating for students in higher education, we as student government leaders are asking that she charitably donate part or all of the $225,000 speaking fee she is reportedly making for this fundraising speech back to the UNLV Foundation of UNLV as a whole,"" Elias Benjelloun, the UNLV student body president, and Daniel Waqar, the student government's public relations director, wrote in a letter addressed to Clinton's foundation. The letter goes on to ask Clinton ""to do what is right"" and donate the money. ""This would be an incredible opportunity for Secretary Clinton to remain true to her commitment to higher education,"" they write. The students, however, never heard from Clinton or the foundation, but are not planning to protest outside the event on Monday. UNLV and Clinton have defended the event. ""Private donations secured by the UNLV foundation from donors funded her speaking fee which was paid to the Harry Walker Agency,"" Afsha Bawany, a spokesperson for UNLV,  said over the summer. University administrators have also argued that the money the event will bring in will far outweigh the money paid the Clinton. Clinton also told ABC News in August that ""all of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to continue its life-changing and life-saving work."" That hasn't stopped Republicans from using the fees to knock Clinton's comments on her personal wealth. During the first interview of her book rollout Clinton argued that she and her husband were ""dead broke"" when they left the White House in 2000. The comment rang hollow, even to many Democrats, given that the Clintons went on to make millions on the paid speaking tour and in book sales. Republicans used fees like that from UNLV to constantly remind people of Clinton's wealth and inarticulate comments for much of the summer. ""Greedy,"" said Tim Miller, executive director of America Risng, an anti-Clinton super PAC.  ""Hey kids, I know that tuition is skyrocketing and you all are loaded up with student debt but I'm going to go ahead and take in $1.8 million from your universities for 8 hours of speeches anyway,"" Miller said in an email to reporters. Reid, who Clinton will appear with on Monday, did not pile on, however, and refused to criticize Clinton's UNLV speech. ""Anything we can do to focus attention on UNLV, that's extremely important to do, and this certainly will focus attention on UNLV, and that's why they have these people come,"" Reid told the Las Vegas Review Journal in June. The Reid-Clinton relationship, especially in the context of Clinton's possible 2016 bid, has been on full display in the last six months. Reid sent a fundraising email for Ready for Hillary over the weekend, touting Clinton as someone ""doing everything she can"" to help Democrats get elected in 2016. The Senate majority Leader also invited Clinton to headline his green energy conference in Las Vegas earlier this year, where Reid said he had ""such admiration for the Clinton family."" ""She's the best,"" Reid said of Clinton.","Hillary Clinton has two events in Las Vegas on Monday, the second for a UNLV fundraiser.

"(RollingStone.com) -- Paul Reubens is dusting off his red bow-tie once more for a film revival of his iconic character Pee-wee Herman. The comedian confirmed the Judd Apatow-produced film was moving forward during an appearance on ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon"" on Wednesday, but wasn't able to divulge too many details just yet. TV on the Radio make Paul Reubens a race car driver for 'Happy Idiot' video . ""There is going to be one,"" Reubens said. ""And I was hoping I could make this huge announcement tonight, but it's a week away, I think, from being announced."" Reubens, however, did say that production on the film would begin next February and that a director had been hired as well, though he wouldn't say who. ""Steven Spielberg?"" Fallon cracked. ""Steven Spielberg!"" Reubens gamely responded, before shaking his head no and adding: ""It's called P.T."" As Reubens noted, news of a new Pee-wee Herman movie, and of Apatow's involvement, has been bouncing around for the better part of three years now. The script was written by Reubens and comedian Paul Rust â€” whose writing credits also include ""Arrested Development"" and ""Comedy Bang! Bang!"" â€” though what kind of adventure the titular hero will embark on remains unknown. Own Pee-wee Herman's 'Big Adventure' bike . The Pee-wee persona originally developed in the 1970s, evolving from Reubens' early improv work with Los Angeles troupe the Groundlings. After missing the final cut for the 1980 cast of ""Saturday Night Live,"" Reubens adapted the eccentric character for the stage with ""The Pee-wee Herman Show,"" which gained national exposure after being filmed and released by HBO as a 1981 special. Of course, Pee-wee became a major star once he hit the big screen with 1985's Tim Burton-directed ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure."" The success of that bizarre comedy helped Reubens launch a TV series, the eventual cult-classic ""Pee-wee's Playhouse,"" in 1986. A film sequel, ""Big Top Pee-wee,"" was released in 1988, though was a critical disaster and relative commercial flop. As a sign of his character's '80s legacy, Pee-wee (not Reubens) was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1991, Reubens was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult theater in Sarasota, Florida. With Pee-wee then the punchline of dirty schoolyard jokes, Reubens retired the character for most of the decade. In 2007, the actor appeared in character at Spike TV's Guy's Choice Awards, marking Pee-wee's first public appearance since 1992; then in 2011, Reubens appeared as Pee-wee in a ""Saturday Night Live"" segment opposite cast member Andy Samberg.

"The tooth fairy's trash became another man's treasure Saturday when a discolored molar that once belonged to John Lennon was put up for auction. The winning bid came in at 19,500 pounds (U.S. $31,200), according to auction results posted online. Michael Zuk, a Canadian dentist, is claiming responsibility for the winning bid. Omega Auction House, which sold the tooth, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday. Lennon gave the tooth to Dorothy ""Dot"" Jarlett when she worked as his housekeeper at his Kenwood home in Weybridge, Surrey, according to her son, Barry. Jarlett, who was employed between 1964 and 1968, developed a warm relationship with Lennon, her son said. ""She was very close with John, and one day whilst chatting in the kitchen, John gave my mother the tooth (he had been to the dentist to have it removed that day) and suggested giving it to my sister as a souvenir, as she was a huge Beatles fan,"" he said. ""It has been in the family ever since."" With the exception of the past two years, the tooth has been in Canada for 40 years after Dot Jarlett's daughter married a Canadian. Barry Jarlett, who said his mother is now 90 years old, said it was the right time to pass it on rather than to risk the tooth getting lost. Karen Fairweather, the owner of Omega Auction House, told CNN last month that the tooth is too fragile for DNA testing but she has no doubt about its authenticity. ""Because it's coming directly from Dot, we don't doubt the provenance of the item,"" she said. Some fans will sink their teeth into anything if they feel it's worth plunking down thousands to get closer their idols. A clump of hair believed to have been trimmed from Elvis Presley's head when he joined the Army in 1958 sold for $18,300 in 2009 at Chicago's Leslie Hindman auctioneers. Jarlett said Lennon gave his family many gifts over the years. He plans to keep a leather wallet, and his mother still has a pearl necklace Lennon gave her when he returned from Japan.","A Canadian dentist says he is responsible for the winning bid .

"Texas state senator Wendy Davis defended her campaign's political ad that features an empty wheelchair and attacks Greg Abbott, saying ""the intent was to demonstrate (his) hypocrisy."" Davis, a Democrat who's running against Abbott for governor this fall, told CNN affiliate KSAT in San Antonio on Saturday that Abbott has unfairly tried to block cases as attorney general that have similarities his own history. ""He rightfully had an opportunity to access the justice system when he was at the receiving end of a tragic accident,"" Davis said. ""But ever since he's been actively fighting to close that door and deny access to others who have been wronged and who deserve to have their day in court."" Abbott, who was elected attorney general in 2002, was partially paralyzed after a tree fell on him while he was jogging at the age of 26. He has remained in a wheelchair ever since and won what's believed to be at least $10 million in a settlement related to his injury, according to the Dallas Morning News. Davis' campaign ad, which was released Friday, opens with an empty wheelchair and mentions the money Abbott received after his freak accident. It goes on to cite two other cases — one related to a disability, the other related to a rape — and argues that Abbott sided with the defendants. Abbott's campaign called the ad ""disgusting"" and put out a web video Monday highlighting statements from the media decrying the spot. The video blasts Davis as being ""unfit for governor."" But Davis, who trails Abbott in recent polls, argued this weekend that he ""has shown that he cares only about advancing his own interests, and often to the exclusion of other people.""","Wendy Davis explains her ""intent"" of a new controversial ad against Greg Abbott.

"Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz recently claimed that Special Prosecutor Angela Corey, who charged George Zimmerman in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, threatened to sue Dershowitz for libel and slander and to have him disbarred. According to Dershowitz, Corey went into a tirade against him after he strongly criticized her. He said Corey was being unethical for not disclosing material facts to the court in the probable cause affidavit she had filed against Zimmerman and had erred by bringing a second-degree murder charge against him, when the evidence didn't support such a charge. In an article, Dershowitz maintained that Corey called Harvard's law school dean and was transferred to a communications office staff member. According to this account, she went into a ""40-minute rant"" about how she could sue Harvard for his comments. She apparently was reminded that Dershowitz had a right to his opinion and that his comments were a matter of academic freedom. I hope that she was also sent a copy of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Dershowitz claims that Corey was required to include in her probable cause affidavit any information that would tend to exculpate Zimmerman of the charges against him. He's incorrect, unfortunately. Florida law doesn't require a prosecutor to go as far as Dershowitz argues, although I believe such information should be included so that a judge can make a fully informed decision. If the facts disclose that the court was intentionally misled by the way information was presented to it, that is a cause for grave concern and reconsideration. However, offering a bare-bones affidavit is relatively common and so long as the language is truthful, done in good faith and doesn't intentionally mislead the court, then the prosecutor is not obligated to provide evidence that might be exculpatory to a defendant in an affidavit. That said, the affidavit Corey filed in the Zimmerman case is about as minimal as I've seen in more than 30 years of practice as a criminal defense attorney. Corey, Dershowitz and I all might have varying interpretations of the law, but because Corey disagrees with Dershowitz, it surely doesn't subject him to being sued by her. If Corey made that threat, it's frightening for a prosecutor in power to act that way and smacks of prosecutorial overreaching in an effort to chill any critics. Corey has not publicly responded to Dershowitz's claim. Corey has made the most serious of claims against Zimmerman, charging that he committed a homicide by the intentional killing of a unarmed teenager. Zimmerman may have done exactly that. Conversely, he may not have. The facts will continue to unfold, and more clarity will emerge. Regardless of the outcome, Corey is protected by prosecutorial immunity for her actions, right or wrong. I'm suspicious when those in power can seemingly act without personal consequence for their actions but behave as if they are also immune from public criticism when they are challenged. They are not. Corey is a public official and public person. When she introduced herself to the American public on the Zimmerman case, she glided on stage, smiled for the cameras, flashed a V for ""victims,"" told the country how she prayed with Travyon's family before she commenced her ""impartial"" investigation and made it clear that she would circumvent the grand jury, which was already scheduled, and make the charging decision herself. An elected official, especially one who has beckoned the cameras and reporters to record and transmit her every word and act, should be subject to the closest scrutiny. Once she opened that door, the public has every right to walk in, including Dershowitz. Zimmerman's history is relevant since it relates to his intent and motive when he shot and killed Martin. Wouldn't it be fair then that Corey's history should be similarly relevant when assessments and opinions are made regarding her prosecution of Zimmerman? Whether the prosecution is a call for justice or a political prosecution is a fair question. Ron Littlepage, a columnist for Corey's hometown newspaper, The Florida Times-Union, identified a number of people who Corey lambasted when they questioned her tactics or motives. They include Sandy D'Alemberte, former president of Florida State University and the American Bar Association; David Utter from the Southern Poverty Law Center; Jeff Goldhagen, a professor and division chief of pediatrics at Shands Hospital; and the writer, Littlepage himself. Does her behavior suggest a person who listens to no one other than those who agree with her? Does her criticism of her critics bespeak one who has an agenda that may be greater than the public may see and hear at a news conference? Corey was appointed by Gov. Rick Scott to prosecute the case after Norman Wolfinger, the experienced state attorney for the 18th Judicial Circuit who had been in office 18 years, mysteriously announced that he was stepping down from the case, ""to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest ..."" Even though Wolfinger had one of his most experienced career prosecutors, Jim Carter, involved in the case within hours of the shooting and had scheduled a grand jury to consider the case, he unexpectedly left. To this day, there's no documentation or public statement about what possible conflict of interest existed. From the many I have talked to and from all that I have learned, it is my informed belief that there was no conflict of interest at all. Contrary to some speculation, Wolfinger wasn't personally involved in the investigation and had never met Zimmerman or Zimmerman's father. Why was that prosecutors' office, which even Corey praised, replaced? A grand jury could have appropriately considered the case. That's what grand juries do. Was there a fear that the grand jury might consider the evidence and not indict? Sure looks like it. If that's true, then the question is whether a fair and impartial review of the evidence actually occurred. Or were the charges that Corey brought a foregone conclusion from the onset? Corey and Scott espouse similar political philosophies. They are NRA-supporting, far-right self-described conservatives. It is telling that Corey, who has recently been praised by many in the African-American community for charging Zimmerman, has been subjected to some of the harshest criticism by many in minority communities for other cases. Corey has prosecuted a string of controversial cases. She led the prosecution against a 12-year-old boy, Christian Fernandez, to try him for first-degree murder in the death of his 2-year-old brother. Christian was born to a 12-year-old mother and if he is convicted, will be the youngest person ever sentenced to life in prison without parole in America. Many in the African-American community in Jacksonville are outraged over Corey's prosecution of an abused black woman who claimed she shot a gun into the air to ward off her abuser. She received a 20-year prison sentence. Were the charges brought against Zimmerman in Martin's death decided purely on the basis of the evidence and facts, or were political considerations in play, such as Scott's and Corey's efforts to appeal to the African-American community? I hope Dershowitz and others keep their scrutiny, questions and concerns forthcoming and don't relent. Our democracy and the Constitution require it. If Corey did everything properly on the case, the truth and its outcome will be the ultimate response to her critics. Alternatively, if politics proves to have been the driving force, we will again have proof of the wonders that the First Amendment brings when it is exercised without regard of retaliation from those wielding power.

"Former President Bill Clinton poked fun Thursday at his reputation as Democrats' ""campaigner-in-chief"" during a political swing through New Hampshire. ""I feel like an old racehorse in a stable, and people just take me out and put me on the track and slap me on the rear to see if I can get around one more time,"" Clinton told an audience of more than 1,200 at a fundraiser for New Hampshire's all-female slate of Democratic candidates for Congress and governor. The former president talked up Reps. Carol Shea-Porter and Annie Kuster, Gov. Maggie Hassan and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, all of whom are defending their seats this midterm election cycle. ""I'm really quite comfortable being here campaigning for women and taking orders,"" he said. ""It's like being at home."" Clinton and his wife have a fondness for New Hampshire. In each of their presidential runs, both the former president and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rekindled their flagging presidential campaigns with surprising success in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary. The Clintons are also known for their close relationship with Democratic Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes. Hillary campaigned for their family friend earlier this week, and Bill will make his third appearance for Grimes in the Blue Grass state next week, according to WBKO. A potential Clinton boost could be beneficial for Grimes, who is trailing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in recent polls and who no longer enjoys political support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee after it pulled out of the state. On Thursday the former president acknowledged to the audience that Americans live in an ""unsettled time,"" but argued Democratic candidates could best confront the country's challenges. Clinton said the Ebola crisis engulfing West Africa and the spread of the terror group ISIS had affected Americans' world view. ""People are unsettled but they're not buying what the other guys are selling -- partly because of who's selling it,"" Clinton said. ""They're trying to get you to stop thinking. They want you to cast resentment votes."" He continued a theme of railing against third-party groups spending millions in political campaigns. ""If we can fix this political dysfunction, there is nothing to hold us back,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The dinos are back, and this time they've got Star-Lord to contend with. OK, not really, but that's probably what went through a lot of people's minds watching the newly released trailer for ""Jurassic World."" Universal Pictures scored a coup casting Chris Pratt in a lead role in the four-quel, now that he is hot off the success of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Pratt's character Owen arrives on the scene partway through the trailer, after it's established that John Hammond's vision of a theme park with real dinosaurs has finally come to fruition -- thanks to Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire -- with Jurassic World. (Be sure to check out that water show involving what looks to be a basilosaurus leaping out of the water to devour a shark!). While the movie might not win any awards for scientific accuracy, the trailer has certainly built up a lot of anticipation for its summer 2015 release -- not to mention the fact that we don't get a good look at that genetically modified dinosaur that terrorizes many in the park.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- A woman who died after she was hit by a spotted eagle ray leaping from the water off the Florida Keys suffered ""multiple skull fractures and direct brain injury,"" a medical examiner said Friday. The dead spotted eagle ray lies on the deck of a boat in Florida. Judy Kay Zagorski, 55, of Pigeon, Michigan, died Thursday of ""blunt force craniocerebral trauma"" after the ray hit her when she was in a boat, Monroe County medical examiner Michael Hunter determined. He gave no indication in the preliminary report whether  the blow from the ray itself or her head hitting the deck, or both, killed her. ""It's just as freakish of an accident as I have heard,"" said Jorge Pino of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. ""The chances of this occurring are so remote that most of us are completely astonished that this happened."" Zagorski was on the boat with her father and other family members and friends. She was seated or standing in the front of the vessel as it was traveling about 25 mph out of a channel, Pino said. ""The ray just actually popped up in front of the vessel,"" he said. ""The father had not even a second to react. It was too late. It happened instantly and the woman fell backwards and, unfortunately, died as a result of the collision."" The accident happened off the coast of Marathon Key, about 2½ hours' drive south of Miami. Zagorski was taken to the Fishermen's Hospital in Marathon, where she was pronounced dead.

Visit upwave.com for more information and follow upwave on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram @upwave. (upwave.com)For one day a year, nearly everyone becomes a football fan. Whether the Super Bowl's draw is the halftime show, the commercials or the game itself doesn't really matter: Party snacks are the true common denominator. The problem for would-be healthy eaters is that Super Bowl snacks are rarely nutritious. Fortunately, there are some easy fixes that'll trim calories and bad fats, allowing you to enjoy the game guilt-free. If only we could cut out the bad play calls just as easily, right? upwave: 4 vegan-friendly Super Bowl snacks . Garlic crab stuffed mushrooms from Meals & Moves . Stuffed mushrooms are a surefire hit at almost any party, Super Bowl or not. Unfortunately, they're often packed with high-fat ingredients like cheese and sausage. For a lighter, fitter take on the classic, try this recipe, which replaces less healthy options with protein-rich Greek yogurt (my new favorite substitute ingredient), low-fat string cheese and lump crab meat. Aside from the delicious flavor, of course, the best thing about these 'shrooms is the fact that eating five will only cost you 79 calories. Score! upwave: 7 ways to lighten up with Greek yogurt . 7-layer bean dip from The Picky Eater . Back in the day, any recipe that featured a layer of sour cream was an instant fave of mine. That's no longer the case, since I've grown older, wiser and less fond of stretchy pants. Of course, traditional seven-layer bean dip is made with stuff like sour cream, full-fat cheese and premade guacamole, and served with processed tortilla chips. This recipe offers a healthy twist on the original with easy, do-it-yourself chips, mashed avocados, veggies and my aforementioned new love, Greek yogurt (mixed with taco seasoning for flavor). Trade up your standard refried beans for nutritionally awesome black beans and you've got a real winner on your plate. Loaded nachos from Living Well Kitchen . Let's face facts here. Most of the time, melted cheese is what turns nachos into a cholesterol-fest. So instead of saturating your tortilla chips with copious amounts of the beloved dairy product, choose alternate toppings for a leaner, more flavorful approach. This super-yummy (not to mention attractive) option uses quality ingredients like lean ground beef or turkey, roma tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, jalapeños and salsa to create an appetizer that'll have your guests doing touchdown-style dances of their own. Of course, if you really love cheesy nachos, you can always sparingly sprinkle the dish with a low-fat variety. upwave: 5 health benefits of cheese . Chipotle chicken sweet potato skins from Half Baked Harvest . A Super Bowl party without potato skins is pretty much a sacrilege. This year, trade regular potatoes for brightly colored sweet potatoes! Although regular spuds certainly have their health benefits, sweet potatoes are lower in calories, higher in fiber and vitamin C and are practically bursting with vitamin A. Mixed with zesty chipotle chicken, sharp low-fat cheddar cheese and various seasonings, this fiber-rich dish will surely become an often-requested specialty. Black bean & quinoa chili from Fit Foodie Finds . Chili is a staple in many homes during the frosty winter months, and its versatile nature makes it a ton of fun to experiment with. This recipe incorporates the current darling of the foodie world -- nutritional superstar quinoa -- along with many traditional chili ingredients, such as black beans, diced tomatoes and various herbs and spices. If you're looking for a leaner, meat-free version of this piping-hot favorite, take this recipe for a spin! Although to chili purists it may seem like a Hail Mary pass, it'll wind up being a tight spiral right into the end zone of yumminess for everyone. upwave: Why quinoa is good for you . Buffalo chicken wings from Snack Girl . Buffalo chicken wings are almost as delicious as they are messy. This fan favorite is usually deep fried, though, making the delicacy chock-full of fat and calories -- about 479 for only three ounces! This fitter option from Snack Girl is only 240 calories for four or five wings, which is plenty to satisfy your craving without killing your diet. The nutritional difference comes via the preparation: These wings are boiled and baked rather than fried.

"As President Obama battles slumping poll numbers and multiple world crises, twice in the past few days he has laid part of the blame for an anxious public at the feet of the media. While he's not the first president to fault some of his problems on journalists, he has added a new twist to the argument. Monday at a Labor Day event in Milwaukee the President touted some of the positive economic news the nation has seen adding: ""So, look, I'm saying all this just because sometimes, you know, if you're watching TV, it's just kind of a whole downer. Now, we've got struggles. We've got work to do. But there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about America."" On Friday he also discussed why the public feels so anxious about the economy despite recovery from the great recession and declining unemployment numbers. He told a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Purchase, New York, some of those reasons for the uneasiness include those still unable to find a job and slower growth in wages and incomes. But then he turned to the media and its impact. ""Second reason people are feeling anxious is that if you watch the nightly news, it feels like the world is falling apart."" Obama acknowledged, ""We are living through some extraordinarily challenging times. A lot of it has to do with changes that are taking place in the Middle East in which an old order that had been in place for 50 years, 60 years, 100 years was unsustainable, and was going to break up at some point."" But at the same time he blamed the explosion of social media for accentuating this concern. ""The truth of the matter is, is that the world has always been messy. In part, we're just noticing now because of social media and our capacity to see in intimate detail the hardships that people are going through. The good news is that American leadership has never been more necessary, and there's really no competition out there for the ideas and the values that can create the sort of order that we need in this world."" These are not the first times the President has played media critic. In 2012 while discussing descriptions of his image as aloof, he told Time magazine, ""My suspicion is that this whole critique has to do with the fact that I don't go to a lot of Washington parties and, as a consequence, the Washington press corps maybe just doesn't feel like I'm in the mix enough with them, and they figure, well, if I'm not spending time with them, I must be cold and aloof."" Also in 2012 during a commencement speech at Barnard College he told the students: ""No wonder that faith in our institutions has never been lower, particularly when good news doesn't get the same kind of ratings as bad news anymore. Every day you receive a steady stream of sensationalism and scandal and stories with a message that suggest change isn't possible; that you can't make a difference; that you won't be able to close that gap between life as it is and life as you want it to be."" And in 2013 he said in an interview with the New Republic that ""one of the biggest factors is going to be how the media shapes debates"" while talking about whether some Republicans would work with the White House.","President Obama said Monday, ""if you're watching TV, it's just kind of a whole downer""

"""The heat gets pretty unbearable in Beppu during the summer, with all the hot springs,"" says Sachiko Okuda, a veteran tour guide and native of Japan's ""hot spring capital."" Looking out the bus window on the way into town, it's easy to believe her. Steam spews from every other building. Beppu, in central Oita prefecture, is home to more than 2,500 onsen -- hot springs. It's the world's second largest source of thermal spring water after Yellowstone National Park in the United States. ""During Golden Week, we get around 60,000 visitors staying at our onsen resorts,"" Okuda explains. But we're not hot-tubbing today. We're on our way to Beppu's so-called Eight Hells (jigoku) hot springs, where the water gushes out at temperatures as hot as 150 C. Some also spout vermillion colored steam -- each ""hell"" is different in its own intense way. Umi-Jigoku (Sea Hell) About 1,200 years ago, a volcano erupted and the cobalt-blue Umi-Jigoku sprang forth -- iron sulfate being the source of its lovely color. Don't be lulled by its beauty, though -- the hot spring is 200 meters deep and, at 98 C, almost boiling. The steam heats a nearby greenhouse where Victoria amazonica water lilies bloom between May and November. Right by the entrance, stores sell pudding cooked in the hot spring's steam. Oniishibozu-Jigoku (Oniishi Shaven Head Hell) Even hotter than Umi-Jigoku, at an average 99 C, Oniishibozu-Jigoku gets its name from the gray mud bubbles it spouts that are said to resemble a monk's shaven head. The town Onishi (one ""i""), in Gunma prefecture, signals its hellish association by using the kanji character for ""demon"" in its name. Every February, the people of Onishi clear their homes of evil spirits by throwing soybeans at invisible demons during the Onishi Setsubun festival. Yama-Jigoku (Mountain Hell) Resembling mountains of mud according to legend, the pools of Yama-Jigoku are in reality more like steaming puddles. Harmless though they might appear, they reache a scorching 90 C. A mini zoo nearby features animals acclimated to the heat -- flamingos, monkeys, snakes and a hippopotamus who waits to be fed carrots. Kamado-Jigoku (Cooking Pot Hell) A red demon statue atop a cooking pot guards the entrance to Kamado-Jigoku. Some of the six differently colored ponds here reach boiling point. There are -- less hot -- hand and foot baths, drinking water at 80 C and jigoku-mushi: Vegetables and hard-boiled eggs cooked in the boiling water and steam. Oniyama-Jigoku (Demon Mountain Hell) Also known as ""Crocodile Hell,"" Oniyama is home to around 80 of the creatures, as well as alligators slithering around in murky water pouring in from a salt spring. The steam pressure here is strong enough to pull one and a half train carriages, as well as creating ideal crocodile-breeding conditions, an onsite sign discloses. Shiraike-Jigoku (White Pond Hell) With rocks in the middle of a milky green pond and its surrounding bushes, Shiraike resembles a Japanese zen garden. A hot spring spouts creamy white steam at 95 C. The water's milky color comes from a mixture of boric acid, salt, sodium silicate and calcium bicarbonate. Piranhas are among the fish kept in a run-down aquarium nearby. Tatsumaki-Jigoku (Tornado Hell) Regarded as a natural treasure of Beppu, Tatsumaki is one of Japan's few geysers. Erupting every half an hour or so for up to 10 minutes, its spout can reach 50 meters without the stone plate that is used to block it off. At a fiendish 150 C, Tatsumaki also has the hottest water of all the hells and emits hot sulfurous gases. Chinoike-Jigoku (Blood Pond Hell) Not only is the water red here, but the steam too. The oldest of the hells, Chinoike's vermillion color comes from the acidic iron and magnesium-filled clay oozing from the ground. At 78 C, this is also the coolest of the eight hells, but signage reminds visitors that you still can't take a dip. An ointment made from the clay that's used to treat skin diseases is sold at a stand nearby. Getting there . Beppu is a two-hour train ride from Fukuoka's Hakata station on the limited express Sonic train. From JR Beppu station, take a 15-minute ride on Kamei bus 5, 7 or 9 to reach Kannawa bus terminal, where the first six hells are located. From Kannawa, a five-minute ride on Kamei bus 16 or 16A takes you to Chinoike-Jigoku and Tatsumaki-Jigoku in Shibaseki hells. The same buses also return you to Beppu station, a 40-minute journey. Alternatively, Kamenoi bus company provides 2.5-hour tours (in Japanese) of all eight hells for ¥3,600 ($35). Tours depart three times a day and can be booked the same day at the Beppu Foreign Tourist Information Office inside JR Beppu station.","Beppu is home to more than 2,500 onsen, or hot springs .

"Paraguay's President on Saturday named a new interior minister and national police chief following clashes between police and peasants that left at least 17 dead. Former Interior Minister Carlos Filizzola and former police chief Paulino Rojas offered resignation letters after the incident, and President Fernando Lugo accepted them Friday. Peasants in eastern Paraguay opened fire Friday on police trying to evict them from private property, initiating the deadly confrontation, local authorities and state-run media said. The president named Ruben Candida Amarilla as the new interior minister, and Arnaldo Sanabria Moran as interim police commander. The violence occurred in Curuguaty, a remote community about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion near the Brazilian border. About 300 law enforcement officers arrived Friday morning to serve the order when some of the approximately 100 farmers who had been occupying the land illegally for more than a month began shooting at them, authorities said. Curuguaty Hospital director Gustavo Gonzalez told the state-run Paraguay Agency of Public Information that seven policemen and more than 10 farmers were killed. Paraguay's president, once a priest, admits to fathering love child . About 80 more police and civilians were wounded and were receiving medical treatment, Gonzalez added. Three of the police officers were flown to Asuncion for treatment, the official news agency said. Authorities did not detail the number of civilians killed, but they did confirm the deaths of seven police, including the chief and deputy chief of the national police's special operations unit. Police said the peasants had been camping on land owned by Blas Riquelme, a businessman and politician active in the South American nation's Colorado Party. But Jose Rodriguez, the leader of the ""tent people"" -- so named because they live in tents, told Radio Nacional that the peasants were on public lands that Riquelme had acquired illegally. Rodriguez lamented the loss of life, but said the peasant leaders did not order the attack on police. He added that the institutions of government don't work and there is a need for agrarian reform. After the incident, Lugo sent soldiers to the zone. ""All the resources of government security and strategic air are working at this moment to restore calm and tranquility to this region of the country,"" he said. ""I have ordered the armed forces to develop their specific mission in support of the police operation."" In a special session, the House of Representatives observed a minute of silence in honor of the dead, the Agency of Public Information reported.

"Authorities at Yellowstone National Park are investigating reports that a tourist crashed a drone into the Grand Prismatic Spring, the park's largest hot spring, on Saturday. The tourist approached a park employee about getting the drone back after losing it in the almost 200-feet deep hot spring. The employee let the tourist go without initially reporting the incident to authorities. ""I don't think the person who they spoke with realized that drones couldn't be flown in the park or the implications of what they were being told,"" Amy Bartlett, spokesperson for Yellowstone National Park, told CNN. Drones are banned in national parks. The National Park Service announced in June that it was prohibiting unmanned aircraft from all park service-controlled lands and waters, totaling about 84 million acres throughout the country. Park rangers have not yet spoken to the drone's operator and are still trying to determine if they can even track that person down. ""The technology certainly has been around for a while, but this is the year that the problem has seemed to come to light for us,"" Bartlett said. Park rangers have not determined if the drone damaged the spring and if it's necessary to recover it. This is the latest in a string of recent drone incidents in national parks and beyond. Visitors watching the sunset over the Grand Canyon were interrupted by a loud drone in April. And volunteers reported that a herd of bighorn sheep at Zion National Park in Utah scattered after being harassed by a drone. Also, a Seattle woman called police in June to report a peeping Tom drone. The drone was hovering outside of her high-rise window, and the woman saw operators on the ground below with camera equipment. The drone operators insist that they were not spying on the woman, but rather her view. They were working on plans for a new building. Police said as long as the drone was flying in a public space, there was little that they could do.","Tourist said to have crashed drone into Grand Prismatic Spring .

"(CNN) -- She just wanted to be heard as one of her country's legislators, and now she's a social media star. Hind Al-Fayez, a female member of the Jordanian Parliament, was in a heated exchange last week with a fellow MP regarding gas imports, when the floor was yielded to another member, Yahya Al-Saud. ""Sit down, Hind!"" Al-Saud loudly repeated numerous times, before banging on the desk and yelling, ""God curse the person who brought the (female) quota to Parliament!"" By law, 15 seats in Jordan's 150-member House of Representatives are reserved for women, with female members determined by election results. The gender dispute, caught on video, has raised awareness of women's rights issues in Jordan and across the Middle East. ""Sit Down Hind"" has become a popular Twitter hashtag, as well as a popular meme on social media. The competing hashtag ""Do Not Sit Down Hind"" has also gained popularity. While some simply poke fun, the incident is also drawing attention to gender inequality. One meme shows Al-Fayez sitting in a chair, and the caption reads: ""a rare photo of Hind Al-Fayez sitting."" One man tweeted, ""The lady made a point. She should never obey and sit down. This #sexsim stupidity should be ended #sitdownhind"" ""I now know for sure that my voice will be heard when I demand my rights in the near future #Sit Down Hind should be ""Don't Sit Down Hind. Thank you Hind Al Fayez for implementing your presence in the parliament, for unlocking your voice & rejecting to be silent,"" a Jordanian woman tweeted. Video of the parliament session shows that when the floor is yielded to Al-Saud, Al-Fayez continues to yell across the floor at another member of the chamber. Numerous parliamentarians are told to sit down. ""How can I speak?"" Al-Saud yells, before cursing the female quota once again. ""The quota is better than a market stall!"" Al-Fayez yells before she sits down, referring to what used to be the only acceptable job for women in the Middle East -- running a stall in a market. One man posted a song on YouTube, titled ""Do Not Sit Down Hind."" The lyrics, in Arabic, include: . ""Enlighten me, why would Eve have to be silent if she were the stronger one? Don't sit down, Hind. Don't sit down, Hind. Don't sit down, Hind. Don't sit down, Hind. Explain to me how it happened that the woman's role is only in the house?"" Al-Fayez explained to CNN's Hala Gorani on Monday what was going through her mind during the incident. ""What I had in mind, and you can see the way I was staring at him, (was) 'What are you talking about? We are now MPs, no matter what, if I won through the quota, if I won through the national list, (at) the end of the day I am a parliamentarian now. You judge me by my performance, you judge me by my achievements, not by being a female or male,'"" she said. ""I am surprised by the media attention of #SitDownHind,"" Yahya Al-Saud told Jordan's Ammon news. ""By the end of the day what he did probably was for the advantage of the female, and not for the disadvantage of the female. It triggered a very important issue that we as Jordanians specifically, and Arabs in general, we are not taking women empowerment that seriously,"" Al-Fayez said.","""Sit down, Hind!"" has become a popular Twitter hashtag .

"President Barack Obama delivered a poignant personal promise to the American people Monday, vowing to continue to fight to improve racial tensions in America, given the ""particular experiences"" he brings to the office. ""I'm going to stay on this,"" the President said Monday in an interview with BET, a network that reaches a predominately young African-American audience. ""Not only am I going to stay on it ... but hopefully the entire society says, 'Let's finally try to make some real progress on this.'"" Once criticized for shying away from the topic of race early on in his presidency, Obama has recently taken a more active role in sharing how his personal experiences help him to empathize with all kinds of people affected by the recent protests on racial tensions -- from protesters, to victims, to law enforcement officers, to families, and most importantly, to black youth. In his interview with BET's ""106 & Park,"" the President cited a meeting he had with nonviolent protesters Monday -- between ages 18-25.  For him, he says, listening to young African-Americans describe their own experiences of being stopped for no reason, or being unjustly labeled as suspicious, strikes a personal chord. ""My mind went back to what it was like for me when I was 17, 18, 20,"" the President said. ""As I told them, not only do I hear the pain and frustration of being subjected to that kind of constant suspicion, part of the reason I got into politics was to figure out how can I bridge some of those gaps and understandings so that the larger country understands this is not just a black problem or a brown problem, this is an American problem."" The President also made a point to invoke Attorney General Eric Holder's race and civil rights record, saying, ""He's got a similar set of stories and experiences he can share."" While most of the protests across the country have been relatively peaceful, many of the gatherings have caused traffic delays and street closures. According the President, those are small prices to pay in order to achieve the larger goal of ending racial tensions in America. ""A country's conscience sometimes has to be triggered by some inconvenience,"" the President said. ""As long as they're peaceful, I think they're necessary. When they turn violent then they're counter-productive."" As he noted in the first half of his interview, teased Sunday, the clear video evidence available in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a black man, in Staten Island in July has helped the broader public come to believe there are racial inequalities in the criminal justice system in a way the shooting death of Michael Brown, also black, in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, did not. In both cases, grand juries failed to indict the white police officers responsible for their deaths. ""It used to be folks would say, 'Well, maybe blacks are exaggerating. Some of these situations aren't what they describe,'"" Obama said. ""What we've now seen on television -- now for everybody to see -- gives us the opportunity to finally have the conversation, that you know, has been a long time coming."" The President will be interviewed by both Univision and Telemundo on Tuesday, both of which are networks that target primarily Latino audiences. In his interview Monday, Obama suggested that people who aren't ""African-American or Latino"" view the deaths of both Michael Ferguson and Eric Garner as ""tragedies.""","President Barack Obama promised, ""I am going to stay on this,"" regarding race relations during a BET interview on Monday .

"The ""Rumours"" are true: Christine McVie has returned to Fleetwood Mac. The keyboardist and singer, who retired from the band in 1998, has rejoined the best-selling group, representative Liz Rosenberg confirmed Tuesday -- and there may be more to come, she said. ""Christine McVie has rejoined Fleetwood Mac and there may be an announcement about a potential tour for all the Macsters down the road,"" Rosenberg said. McVie, 70, became part of Fleetwood Mac after the departure of founding guitarist Peter Green in 1970. She was then married to the group's bassist, John McVie. 35 years of 'Rumours' In 1975, the three remaining members of the group -- the two McVies and drummer Mick Fleetwood -- added guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and singer Stevie Nicks. The five-person lineup became one of the most successful bands in pop history, with such best-selling albums as ""Fleetwood Mac"" (1975), ""Rumours"" (1977), ""Tusk"" (1979) and ""Mirage"" (1982). McVie's lush, smoky voice can be heard on many of the band's biggest hits, including ""Say You Love Me,"" ""Don't Stop"" (trading vocals with Buckingham), and ""Think About Me."" Fleetwood Mac's success brought with it a number of romantic complications -- the McVies divorced, Buckingham and Nicks split up and Fleetwood had an affair with Nicks -- much of which was alluded to on their records. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.

"Protesters threw a grenade at a vehicle carrying anti-riot police in Mombasa Tuesday, killing one officer and wounding 13 others, a police official said. The violence came on the second day of protests after a radical Muslim cleric was killed in the same city Monday by assailants his wife claims were police. Provincial police chief Aggrey Adoli told CNN the police were on their way to help beef up security because of the ongoing riots.  An unknown perpetrator hurled a grenade at the police truck, causing the fatality and injuries.  The wounded are being treated at two hospitals in Mombasa, Adoli added. Earlier, protesters barricaded roads with stones and blocked access to and from the Majengo neighborhood, where Aboud Rogo Mohammed often preached.  Demonstrators stopped vehicles from coming into or leaving the area, and threw stones at police, who responded with tear gas. The radical Islamic cleric, who faced charges relating to terrorism, was killed in a daylight ambush Monday morning in the coastal city of Mombasa, Kenya police said. Aboud Rogo Mohammed was accused of supporting Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia and was blacklisted by the United States and the United Nations Security Council. He also faced charges before a Kenyan court for planning terror attacks in Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city and a popular tourist destination. Kenya Police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said Monday authorities were taking Rogo's death seriously. ""It is disappointing to us, because we had a case in court and we had evidence to go to its logical conclusion,"" Kiraithe said. But Rogo's wife, Hania Said, claimed Monday the shooters were Kenyan police. Kiraithe dismissed that claim and asked for the public to give the police information. ""That can only be nonsense,"" he said. ""For what conceivable reason would that happen? What we need is for everyone to cooperate without any fear. We have a witness protection program now."" Rogo's wife said the cleric was traveling with his family in a van on the Mombasa-Malindi highway when they were ambushed by a group of men who shot her husband more than a dozen times. She said she was shot in the leg and Rogo's father was shot in the hand. Their van, a 14-seat white Nissan, was riddled with bullets and splattered with blood. Police tried to take away Rogo's body, but a group of supporters refused and took it away to be buried in the Muslim public cemetery. The shooting sparked immediate protests by Mombasa's Muslim community. Anti-riot police responded with tear gas, and a government vehicle was burned near a mosque where Rogo once preached. After violence broke out Monday, Prime Minister Raila Odinga called for restraint by residents of Mombasa, and asked that the government be allowed to get to the bottom of the matter. ""I appeal to our people not to use this sad act to inflict more pain and suffering on our country,"" said a statement on the prime minister's website.  ""Let us come together in calm instead and join hands in order to get to the bottom of the murder."" Aside from its sandy white beaches that draw big tourism dollars for the Kenyan economy, Mombasa features a large port that is used for transportation by neighboring landlocked countries.  Any prolonged unrest could affect regional trade. The violence could also derail efforts to rebuild the region's international reputation, after the coastal area outside the city saw a string of kidnappings of western foreigners last year. A U.N. report in July said that Rogo ""threatened the peace, security, or stability of Somalia, by providing financial, material, logistical or technical support to Al-Shabaab."" It also claimed that he was a key recruiter of Kenyan Muslims to fight with Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group that is trying to overthrow the Somali government.","One police officer is killed when protesters throw a grenade in Mombasa .

"(CNN)  -- It was a success story the White House was eager to highlight: Earlier this year, President Obama attended the graduation of 25 police recruits in Columbus, Ohio, touting it as a victory for the federal stimulus package. On March 6 in Columbus, Ohio, President Obama touted the jobs the stimulus plan would save. Without the money, the officers never would have hit the streets. They were to be laid off before their first day of patrol, victims of city budget cuts, until the stimulus money saved the class. But the White House said the $1.2 million grant only guaranteed their jobs until the end of the year. And facing a growing deficit and a fight to pass an income tax hike, Columbus Police on Tuesday announced massive budget cuts that could mean hundreds of layoffs. Among those who could lose their jobs if voters reject the increase: the 25 new officers who shook the president's hand. Despite optimistic national headlines on March 6, the day of the president's trip, city officials warned the influx of federal stimulus money wasn't going to be enough to end their financial crisis. Obama acknowledged in his remarks the money was no silver bullet. ""By itself, this recovery plan won't turn our economy around or solve every problem,"" he said then, and ""this police force still faces budget challenges down the road."" The challenges, including a city deficit that could reach $120 million, would mean the loss of 324 officers, more than 15 percent of the force, under a budget unveiled by Chief Walter Distelzweig. ""This is devastating,"" he told reporters Tuesday. ""None of us signed up for this kind of task."" Distelzweig said under the 2010 budget plan, the department will focus on priority calls and maintaining public safety. ""Policing in this city will change as we know it today,"" he said. "" ... [We're] going to do less with less."" He stressed the cuts are not final, and city voters are being asked to approve an income tax hike in August. The half-percent increase, if passed, could avoid the firings and furloughs. Distelzweig said the announced cuts are not meant to be a threat to voters. ""It's math -- whatever money is available,"" he said. Columbus is not alone, of course, in its budget crisis. To its south, Cincinnati is looking at job cuts and reduction in services because of a higher-than-expected deficit. Smaller cities such as Mansfield, 60 miles to its north, have been forced to lay off up to a third of its officers. CNNMoney.com this week reported 16 states around the nation have raised taxes this year, with proposed increases in 17 others. Looking at the graduates receiving their diplomas that day, Obama said, ""This economy needs your employment to keep it running."" ""I look into their eyes and I see their badges today, and I know that we did the right thing,"" he told the crowd on March 6. ""These jobs and the jobs of so many other police officers and teachers and firefighters all across Ohio will now be saved because of this recovery plan."" The grant did its job and funded the class for a year. But local budget problems took over. And the 25 officers, a hopeful symbol that day for the White House, may turn into a grimmer example of financial realities still facing communities around the country.","In March, White House touted $1.2 million grant as a stimulus success story .

"Editor's note: Gladys Limón is a staff attorney at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund in Los Angeles, California. Before joining the organization, she spent two years as an attorney at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver, and Jacobson, and also was a law clerk to U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton in the Eastern District of California. Gladys Limón says justice wasn't done in the trial of two charged in the death of Luis Ramirez. (CNN) -- On July 14, 2008, 25-year old Luis Ramirez, a father of two, died after being brutally beaten by a group of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, high school football players who yelled racial epithets throughout the beating. During the week of April 27, a Schuylkill County jury heard the criminal case against two of the four assailants, Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak, including charges of homicide, ethnic intimidation, aggravated assault and hindering prosecution. The jury heard overwhelming evidence describing how Ramirez was twice knocked to the ground, surrounded, kicked and stomped on by the football players. According to witnesses, the attack ended after Piekarsky kicked Ramirez in the head as he lay still on the pavement, causing him to convulse and foam at the mouth. Medical experts testified that the kick to the head fractured Ramirez's skull and resulted in such extreme swelling of the brain that his skull could not contain it. Undisputed evidence explained that the assailants met on the following day to fabricate a cover-up story. Despite the overwhelming evidence of the violent, racially motivated attack, the jury found the two defendants guilty of only a misdemeanor -- simple assault. The flagrant injustice resulting from the verdicts has once again shed light on both the wave of hate crimes against Latinos as well as the failure of our judicial system consistently to administer justice fairly without regard to race. In this case, Ramirez was not only the victim of a heinous, racially motivated crime but also of a prejudiced local judicial process. Since the verdict, the jury foreman has courageously come forward to express his sentiment that racism contaminated the jury's deliberations. Although he said did not believe enough evidence was presented to overcome the reasonable doubt in his mind, the jury foreman stated that he believed some of the jurors already had predetermined the results before their deliberations. The possibility that the integrity of the jury's deliberations was compromised is not unlikely given the development of the case and the defense attorneys' dogged strategy to appeal to the jurors' prejudices and fears. For example, the defense made a large issue of the fact that a Latino acquaintance of Ramirez's appeared at the scene after the beating was over with a BB gun, and that the acquaintance had an inconsequential encounter with the defendants as they were fleeing the crime scene. Since the BB gun appeared as the defendants were fleeing, it could not possibly have had any relevance to, or bearing on, the defendants' actions for which they were tried, yet the defense attorney made it a point to show the weapon to the jury three times in an effort to associate Luis with a criminal element. The jury, which was selected in one day, heard the defense attorneys characterize the defendants as ""boys"" and ""kids"" who felt threatened by and had to defend against Ramirez. By allowing the introduction of irrelevant, unduly prejudicial evidence, the court permitted the defense throughout the trial  to demonize Ramirez in contrast to its efforts to humanize and garner sympathy for the accused. While the evidence and testimony presented to criminalize Ramirez had absolutely no relation to the underlying brutal acts committed by the defendants, they had everything to do with appealing to the jurors' prejudices against the Mexican ""illegal"" immigrant. No one, not even the prosecution, bothered to emphasize that Ramirez was a real person -- a father of two young children, partner, son and brother. Common sense dictates that four star football players were unlikely to have been threatened by Ramirez, and one of them so testified when he stated that he was not scared of Ramirez because he ""was smaller"" and they outnumbered him by six to one. Yet it seems prejudice overruled reason in this case, and that the life of a Mexican immigrant who was fatally beaten by white ""kids"" was deemed subhuman. Indeed, after the verdicts were read, the disregard for the taking of Ramirez's life was again pronounced by the jubilant cheers and applause from the defendants' families and friends that were more fitting for a football game victory than an acquittal from serious criminal charges in the brutal beating and death of another human being. What is equally disturbing is the message the verdicts carry -- that Latino immigrants can be brutally beaten without any consequence to those who commit the crimes. In the wake of the anti-Latino immigrant campaign that has raged over the last several years, hate crimes against Latinos across our nation have surged by 40 percent from 2003 to 2007, according to FBI statistics. The anti-immigrant rhetoric spewed by irresponsible politicians and media personalities has penetrated our households, schools and entire communities. We must be vigilant to expose and challenge this xenophobia wherever we see it. Racial hatred is not only a threat to the fabric of our society but can have dangerous, deadly consequences. Unfortunately, as a result of the verdicts in this case, the Latino community in Shenandoah and throughout our country now stands even more vulnerable to similar hate-filled crimes. This travesty of justice is a sobering moment for our country, as we are forced as a nation again to face the disturbing fact that racism and xenophobia continue to seep into the hearts and minds of Americans. The glaring injustice in the case of Luis Ramirez behooves all compassionate and fair-minded people to stand up against it. In fact, it is quite encouraging that people of all backgrounds from throughout the country, including the Shenandoah area, have expressed their own outrage at the verdicts and have joined the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund's call for justice for Ramirez. A federal prosecution is in the public interest to eradicate bias-motivated violence and to secure substantial justice in this case. The Department of Justice has initiated an investigation, and we urge it to move forward with federal civil rights charges to provide justice for the death of Ramirez and for our national interest. We must not allow bigotry and hate to define our own reactions to this injustice. Rather, we must respond firmly and proactively by uniting across communities to condemn these actions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gladys Limón.","Gladys Limón: Luis Ramirez was beaten to death in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania .

"(CNN)A pilot and CEO of a health research firm, who survived a 2010 mishap involving a plane in Gaithersburg, Maryland, was among six people killed in Gaithersburg Monday when a twin-engine plane crashed into a subdivision. Marie Gemmell and her sons, Cole, 3, and Devon, an infant, were found in the second-floor bathroom of one of the houses struck by the plane, said Pete Piringer, the public information officer for Montgomery County Fire and Rescue. Michael Rosenberg, CEO and founder of a North Carolina clinical development company called Health Decisions, was identified as one of the people on the airplane, according to a statement from the company. The flight originated in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, close to the company's headquarters in Durham. The National Transportation Safety Board has not said who piloted the plane, but Rosenberg was certified to fly that type of aircraft, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. The crash occurred at about 10:44 a.m. Monday as the twin-engine Embraer EMB-500/Phenom 100 made an instrument approach to Montgomery County Airport, Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB said at a news conference near the wreckage. FAA records show that Rosenberg piloted a small plane that left the runway during a landing at the same airport on March 1, 2010. The plane skidded 100 feet off the runway and came to rest in trees, nose down in the mud, the NTSB report says. There was one minor injury, the report added. In Monday's incident, the plane went down about a mile from the airport, hitting three houses in all. The airport is about 25 miles northwest of Washington. Witness Fred Pedreira, 67, told CNN affiliate WJLA the plane appeared to be out of control when it crashed. ""This guy, when I saw him, for a fast jet with the wheels down, I said, 'I think he's coming in too low,'"" said Pedreira, who lives near the crash scene. ""Then he was 90 degrees -- sideways -- and then he went belly-up into the house and it was a ball of fire. It was terrible."" In describing the crash site, Sumwalt said, ""The main part of fuselage is rested up against the second house, with the tail of the airplane actually at the front door of that house, and then finally it appears that one of the wings was catapulted over into the third house where the majority of the fire damage occurred. So the aircraft wreckage itself is really in two main areas, but it damaged three houses."" Montgomery County Police Chief Chris Manger said Gemmell's husband and the couple's 5-year-old child were not home at the time. ""This a tragic loss for the Montgomery County community,"" Fire Chief Steven Lohr said at the news conference. On Monday, Sumwalt said the plane's ""black box"" had been recovered from the wreckage. He said the device contained the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder. ""It has been rushed to our headquarters in Washington, D.C., where... investigators in our labs will begin this evening downloading the data,"" he said. There was no ""mayday"" call from the plane, and the first sign of trouble was a radio call from someone who saw the crash. ""I think that Phenom just came up short,"" the call said, according to LiveATC.net. ""What? Holy [deleted]!"" someone else replied on the frequency. Later, someone says, ""There's nothing left of that house."" A woman who lives near the scene of the plane crash told CNN affiliate WUSA she might have heard victims calling for help. ""I heard screams and somebody else beside me heard screams, but we're not sure if it was from inside the house or behind the house. ... We're not completely sure it came from inside the house, but we did hear screams,"" the woman said. She also described how she first became aware that something was terribly wrong. ""At first I heard a big sputtering sound. By the time we rushed over here, you see a plane hit the side of the house and then crash right down and there was a big explosion,"" the woman said. She also says she heard a loud booming sound. ""By then, the flames were just so high and then it was a big mushroom effect of smoke and it just burst into flames."" CNN's Deanna Hackney, Leslie Holland and Rene Marsh contributed to this story.","A pilot named Michael Rosenberg crashed at the same airport in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Seeking to alleviate concern about rising oil prices, Saudi Arabia's oil minister said his country and other OPEC members have the capacity to produce surplus oil, Saudi Press Agency reported. Saudi Arabia alone has a surplus of about 4 million barrels per day, the agency quoted Minister Ali al-Naimi as saying. It was not clear from the news agency's report whether al-Naimi meant that Saudi Arabia is already producing an extra 4 million barrels or that it can, if the need arises. On Tuesday, 87 countries -- including Saudi Arabia -- signed a charter to limit price fluctuations and stabilize the market. The move came as oil prices jumped 6%. Prices spiked as high as $98 a barrel earlier in the session, as the crisis in Libya sparked concern that the turmoil roiling the Middle East could spread to other producing countries -- including Saudi Arabia. ""Now it's starting to look like the entire region's on fire, and it looks like it could spread to other parts of the region,"" said Peter Beutel, oil analyst with energy risk management firm Cameron Hanover. ""This thing is getting worse and worse and worse, and it could spread to Saudi Arabia, and that's the big fear."" Libya's importance with regard to oil prices doesn't hinge so much on its oil-producing and exporting capabilities, said Beutel. To put things in perspective, Libya produces about 1.6 million barrels of crude per day, compared with Saudi Arabia's daily production of 8.4 million barrels and worldwide production of 87 million barrels, he said. But now the monarchy of Saudi Arabia, one of the United States' strongest allies and an island of stability in an otherwise tempestuous region, faces an uncertain future. ""Markets have always relied on Saudi Arabia to act as the swing producer, boosting output if supplies were disrupted elsewhere,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging markets strategy for Brown Brothers Harriman. The International Energy Agency, an industry group based in Austria, said Tuesday that it ""stands ready, as always, to make oil available to the market in the event of a major supply disruption if alternative supplies cannot readily be made available via normal market mechanisms."" And OPEC has also said it stands ready to hold an emergency meeting to raise its output if needed.","87 countries sign a charter to limit price fluctuations .

"On Sunday, the Pentagon announced it transferred six Guantanamo Bay detainees to Uruguay for resettlement as refugees, a move which House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says should be reconsidered. ""I've been opposed to this notion that we're going to farm out Gitmo to places,"" Rogers told Candy Crowley on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" noting most of the detainees sent to Uruguay are not originally from there. According to Rogers, the foreign intelligence services the United States pays to monitor the newly released detainees in countries such as Uruguay are often ill-equipped to handle the job. ""What we have found in the past is it doesn't work very well,"" he said. ""I don't think that surprises anybody. So I argue that maybe we ought to rethink what we're doing here."" Echoing the sentiments of many members of Congress, Rogers said some previously released prisoners are now re-engaged in the terrorist fight. ""We knew that was going to happen,"" Rogers said. ""That's why those of us who were trying to do the review of this were so concerned, because they were so interested in getting them out, that they forgot to do the due diligence -- I think -- that would allow them to at least protect those that were going to go back into the fight, from getting back into the fight."" Last week, the Obama administration suffered a huge setback in its attempt to close down the detention camp permanently when the House passed a $585 billion defense authorization bill excluding language that would have banned the transfer of any more prisoners to Guantanamo Bay, a stipulation the White House had sought. On Monday, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said it would also likely be absent from the final bill sent to the President's desk. ""Our language (on Guantanamo) ... will not be in,"" Levin told reporters last week. The President has sought to close Guantanamo Bay since he took office in 2008 -- and issued an executive order to do so in 2009 -- but has faced fierce opposition from members of Congress, like Rogers, who allege that doing so is a threat to national security. Outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who recently announced his resignation in light of administrative pressure, authorized the prisoner release, according to the Pentagon. His reluctance to approve the mission until now could have been a part of the tension leading to his resignation. But House Intelligence Committee member Adam Schiff, D-California, defended Hagel's decision to delay the authorization of the mission, citing his continued concerns over the timing of the prisoner release. ""There were a couple of things I think Secretary Hagel had some continued concerns over,"" Schiff said on CNN's ""Newsroom."" ""He wanted to make sure that he was satisfied that he could sign on the dotted line."" Schiff pointed to Uruguay's recent presidential election as one of the roadblocks. ""There was an election taking place in Uruguay, and I think the president -- who agreed to accept these detainees -- didn't want it to be an issue in the presidential campaign,"" Schiff said. ""And so it was stayed until after that election was over.""","The Pentagon transferred six Guantanamo Bay detainees to Uruguay, it announced Sunday .

"The family of American photojournalist Luke Somers, who was held hostage and then killed by al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, did not know of U.S. efforts to rescue him until the terrorist group released a video of him pleading for his life last week, family members told CNN on Monday. Somers and South African Pierre Korkie, a teacher, were fatally shot amid a failed U.S. military raid to rescue them Friday. Lawmakers defend failed hostage rescue mission . The family was not asked to sign off on the U.S. effort to free Somers, his stepmother Penny Bearman and sister Lucy Somers said. Some family members condemned the rescue bid as endangering life, though the general feeling is that more should have been done sooner, they said. ""We feel that Luke's stance would have been that more discussion should have taken place between the countries concerned and that these crises should be solved with more dialogue and less conflict,"" Bearman and Somers said. The hostage takers did not communicate directly with Somers' family, so if there were any specific demands, they were given to the U.S. government in private, the two women said. Somers, 33, was born in  the United Kingdom. UK Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood responded to an urgent question in Britain's House of Commons Monday on the failed rescue. ""It was for the Americans to make a judgment on this,"" Ellwood said. ""It was decided that the threat to life was imminent and therefore action needed to be taken."" He reiterated that Britain did not negotiate with hostage takers, saying that the UK government believed that paying ransoms ""simply encourages more hostages to be taken."" Like many journalists of his generation, Somers traveled to the Middle East to tell the stories of the region's strife and the people affected by it. His friends said the Arab Spring uprising in 2011 was a motivator. He was taken hostage in September 2013. A November raid by U.S. and Yemeni special forces freed eight other hostages, but not Somers. The militants subsequently issued demands and a threat to kill him. The Committee to Protect Journalists said Somers was ""the third American freelance journalist to die this year while being held captive, after James Foley and Steven Sotloff were murdered in Syria."" The organization also pointed out that the ""raid is at least the third to be launched by U.S. special forces in an attempt to rescue American journalists held hostage in Syria and Yemen. All of the raids failed to rescue the journalists."" Pierre Korkie was kidnapped along with his wife in Taiz province in May last year as they returned to South Africa for his father's funeral, the non-governmental organization Gift of the Givers said. AQAP freed Yolande Korkie in January after negotiations with Gift of the Givers and had been due to release her husband Sunday, the group said on its site.","U.S. hostage Luke Somers died during an attempt to rescue him in Yemen Friday .

"President Barack Obama took an evening away from politicking Sunday to honor top artists -- and crack some jokes. Obama received the five Kennedy Center honorees at the White House before the annual gala that honored this year Tom Hanks, Sting, Al Green, Lily Tomlin and ballerina Patricia McBride. Sting got a presidential mention not just for his chart-topping music career, but also for his stage name. ""Now, not everybody can pull off a name like Sting, but this guy can.  His wife, Trudie, calls him Sting. Apparently his kids call him Sting,"" Obama said to laughs at the White House reception. ""'POTUS' is a pretty good nickname -- but let's face it, it's not as cool as Sting.  I kind of wish I was called Sting."" But, Obama conceded, ""I'm stuck with 'POTUS,'"" which stands for President of the United States. Sting, however, later said on the red carpet he was ""not so sure"" his name is cooler than the President's moniker. Comedy Central show host Stephen Colbert, who emceed the Kennedy Center event, made sure he spotlighted the high profile guests at last night's events, especially whom he called the ""most powerful and influential person in the world"": First lady Michelle Obama. ""Madam First Lady, lovely to see you, good evening. There she is, looking radiant, next to the President, which I assume means she has no future plans to run for office,"" Colbert quipped. ""There are a lot of Democrats who don't have that courage."" Democratic candidates locked in tight races in the 2014 midterms largely distanced themselves from  Obama, and he stayed away from the campaign trail in the tightest Senate races. Colbert also noted the nonpartisan nature of the soirée, which he credited to Tom Hanks. ""Tonight, Washington puts the arts above politics, because no matter what party you belong to, everyone wants a selfie with Tom Hanks,"" Colbert joked. Earlier in the evening Obama also honored Hanks and his cult roles in movies like ""Big"" -- which Obama said he watched Saturday night -- ""Apollo 13"" and ""Forrest Gump,"" in which Hanks' character gives another U.S. President, Lyndon B. Johnson, a look at his wounded behind in the movie. ""I'm glad he got that last one out of his system before this evening,"" Obama said.

"(CNN)You can rest when you're dead, as the saying goes. And in Ghana, your eternal slumber is done in style. Burying your loved ones in intricate, beautifully crafted -- and, at times a little surreal -- caskets is a common tradition in some parts of the the West African nation. Based in Awutu, a small town in Ghana's central region, self-taught carpenter Kudjoe Affutu has made a name for himself with his eye-catching style of coffins. ""I love playing with the wood,"" he says. ""I didn't study it in the school -- I just love carving."" The plucky, young artisan has always had a passion for woodwork and inspired by artists before him such as Kane Kwei and Paa Joe, his startup began to take shape. ""I saw a designed coffin somewhere and I said: 'No, I have to do this' and I forced my parents to push me into it."" By 2007, Affutu had opened the New Generation Woodwork Shop. Seven years on, and the craftsman has found big success thanks to his fantastical funerary boxes. From chickens to sewing machines . Burial rites in Ghana are incredibly important in honoring ancestry. In a country where the passing of a loved one is often celebrated with a party-like fervor, the elaborate coffin art allows mourning family members and friends to send their dearly departed off to the afterlife in style. Affutu adds: ""It's a special coffin that talks a lot about the deceased. But also for the family who sees it to as a last gift to the deceased."" Often designs for these figurative coffins reflect the deceased's vocation or personality. Perhaps if you worked as a farmer, a chicken casket could be for you. What about a fashion designer? Well, a sewing machine, what else? Prices for a custom-made coffin from Affutu vary due to design request, size and where the casket needs to be shipped to. ""When it's local, it could be around 1,000 Ghanaian cedi (around $300) and above. Exported ones are $1000 or more."" Eye-catching and strange creations . Over the years,  Affutu has heard some weird, wonderful and downright bizarre requests for casket creations. Yet, whatever the request, he doesn't judge a family's choice -- he just sees it as a challenge. ""I just think of it and am done. I always see my orders as normal no matter how weird it is,"" explains the artisan coffin maker. He adds: ""A family came here some two years ago, and they said our late mother used to be a midwife and we want a designed coffin, something that can talk about her work -- and I came up with a pregnant woman who is about to deliver and it was a fantastic piece."" Affutu has also constructed a variety of fisherman-inspired pieces for departed sea workers including canoes, fishing boats, nets and of course, a variety of fish. Today Affutu employs six full-time staff. But with an increased workforce, other problems arise. ""Like today, for example, we have a lot of work here and I don't have a big shop..."" He adds: ""Sometimes the materials we use -- it can be scarce for a while and we don't have enough money to gather or to store materials for many years."" However, Affutu is optimistic about the future, ""In the next five years I want to extend my shop and even the workers or apprentices I have, so that when somebody orders something you can deliver days before its time.""","Kudjoe Affutu has been designing coffins since 2007 .

"Melissa Atkins Wardy calls it her ""a-ha"" moment. There she was looking for her first sippy cup for her then 6-month-old daughter. Her choices: Mickey Mouse, Diego and ""Toy Story"" characters for boys, and princesses -- and more princesses -- for girls. Already fired up, she walked through the toy aisles and saw what she describes as a further gender divide. Girls were offered baby dolls, princesses and sexy fashion figures; the boys section had superheroes, building blocks, science kits and dinosaurs. ""That was it. There was no middle ground. I didn't see any dolls or cooking sets for boys, nor building blocks or fire trucks for girls,"" writes Atkins Wardy in her new book ""Redefining Girly: How Parents Can Fight the Stereotyping and Sexualizing of Girlhood, from Birth to Tween.""

They were at a restaurant and the clown came to the table and offered the boys a whole bunch of selections for what balloon animal to make and then he offered the girl a flower or a tiara,"" said Atkins Wardy, a mom of two. ""The mom's like, 'What if she wants a light saber, too?'"" The birth of a cause . After Atkins Wardy's eye-opening shopping experience, she decided to start a business creating empowering T-shirts for girls and boys. Her company, Pigtail Pals and Ballcap Buddies, offers selections such as a girl doctor with the headline ""Call me in the morning"" and another that says ""I'm growing up,"" and lists words like inquisitive, fearless and daring. Her business led to a blog and ultimately, a cause: trying to raise awareness about gender stereotypes and how damaging they can be. ""One pink pacifier or sippy cup or Lego set isn't a big deal...it's when the lowest common denominators of femininity become the marketing catalyst for every product that's made for females,"" said Atkins Wardy, who has an 8-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son. The fact that there are ""girl"" products and ""boy"" products at all is also part of the problem, she said. ""It teaches children there is only one way to be a girl and one way to be a boy,"" she said. ""When you have a little girl like mine who is obsessed with the ocean and giant squids and insect infestations in homes, she's considered weird or odd or a tomboy when in fact, science and things like that should be considered girly."" As a mom of two girls -- including one who hopes Peyton Manning of the Denver Broncos calls her to play on his team in this week's Super Bowl -- I can totally relate. I, along with so many other parents, am frustrated about the definitions of what's girly and what's not, and the separate products and clothing offered to girls and boys. 'Pink and pretty to hot and sexy' A larger question is just whether this gender differentiation in products and fashion actually leads to another big concern, especially for parents of daughters, the sexualization of our young girls. Atkins Wardy of Janesville, Wisconsin, says there's a correlation. ""You have to connect the dots,"" she said. ""With princess culture and all these pink toys that are almost always focused on fashion and beauty and how a girl can please somebody else, either by keeping a nice house or looking like a perfect princess, that all segues into the sexualization side of the market. ""Once you're done with princesses, if you are growing up in that girly-girly culture, the next thing offered to you are these sexualized dolls and you are growing up too fast,"" she said. ""You are being introduced into adult concepts of sexuality that otherwise wouldn't be present in toys and it doesn't allow a girl to develop on her own, and at her own pace. ""The pretty princess culture focuses on appearance and that segues (from) 'sweet and pink and pretty' to 'hot and sexy.' There's no room for girlhood in that space."" Encouraging girls' 'personal brand' So what's a parent to do? Atkins Wardy's book, which she hopes is almost like a ""recipe book for parents,"" offers step-by-step advice. She encourages us to teach our children to think critically, which can be as simple as watching a television show and raising questions about why girls are portrayed a certain way. For instance, if the girl character is getting rescued by a boy, we can tell our girls the story could easily have been changed so the girl is doing the rescuing. ""I talk about parents teaching girls a personal brand,"" she said. ""She kind of has this benchmark that ... when these toxic messages come in and out from culture, she can then bounce against (them) or not and say, 'Well this doesn't fit what my mom and dad taught me.'"" There are not enough parents having these kinds of conversations with their girls and boys, Atkins Wardy said. Moms on Facebook might see something inspiring such as a new ad by Dove encouraging women to love themselves, no matter what. ""They all click like and they love it,"" she said, ""But are you taking that second step and sharing that with your kid and really talking about it ... and just being conscious of the media you are taking in?"" Parents can also make their voices heard, Atkins Wardy said, whenever they see a product, ad, or clothing that they believe stereotypes and sexualizes girls. When Disney gave Merida, the heroine from ""Brave"" a makeover, more than 250,000 people signed a ""Keep Merida Brave"" online petition. Disney ultimately backed down from changing the character's look and dress. ""Once you aggregate these parents' voices and the tens of thousands of voices, you really can start to make change,"" she said. 'Once you see it, you can't unsee it' Atkins Wardy often tells parents in her community that once they become aware of the stereotyping and the sexualization, they won't be able to look away. ""Once you see it, you can't unsee it,"" she writes. It's also never too late to start doing something about it, she says. That includes letting our girls know they can be whatever they want to be. ""There are many ways to be a girl and 'Redefining Girly' is about giving girls the space to show us who they are,"" she said.

"New York (CNN) -- The mansion and four-acre estate featured in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 film ""The Godfather"" is up for sale for a whopping $2.9 million. Owner Jim Norton said he put the eight-bedroom, five-bathroom Staten Island home on the market after his father recently passed away. The film employed a star-studded cast, including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Diane Keaton. Brando played fictional character Vito Corleone, the head of an organized crime family who transfers power to his reluctant son. The film is based on a novel written by Mario Puzo and begins with a scene filmed at the iconic estate, where the aging Corleone accepts requests for favors during the wedding reception of his daughter Connie, played by Talia Shire. The estate features a four-car garage, two fireplaces, an English pub and an in-ground swimming pool, Norton said. His mother collected behind-the-scenes mementos from the film, including pictures and autographs from cast and crew members, he said. Realtor Connie Profaci said the location was suggested by neighbor and co-star Gianni Russo, who played Corleone's son-in-law in the film. ""His family lived near the home and was familiar with the English Tudor enclave connecting Todt Hill and Emerson Hill,"" Profaci said. ""Paramount producer Al Ruddy agreed and the rest was history.""","The mansion featured in the 1972 film ""The Godfather"" is for sale .

"A teenager with cancer who touched the hearts of many in the United Kingdom with his tireless fundraising efforts died Wednesday at age 19, his mother said via Facebook. It is news that will sadden many supporters won over by Stephen Sutton's mix of determination, generosity and good humor in the face of his terminal illness. While he lost the battle to stay alive, he achieved a remarkable feat: Having set himself the challenge of raising some $17,000 for a teenage cancer charity, he ultimately inspired over $5.4 million in donations. On his website, Stephen's Story, he tells how he was first diagnosed with cancer in 2010, at age 15. ""In a weird way, I see my first cancer diagnosis as a good thing. It was a huge kick up the backside. It gave me a lot of motivation for life."" He created a ""bucket list"" on Facebook of 46 things he wanted to do before he ran out of time. ""Some things on my bucket list include sky diving. Crowd surfing in a rubber dinghy. Playing drums in front of a huge crowd. I ended up doing it live at Wembley. Hug an animal bigger than me."" But, he says, as he checked off each item, something else happened. ""Since starting the bucket list, I've had people come up to me and offer to raise funds for me. To go on holiday or tick off a new item on my bucket list. But I've actually refused. And decided to give the money to charity instead."" That decision led to a stupendous fundraising effort that won him the backing of celebrities and the general public, despite doctors telling him in November 2012 that his illness was terminal. On the Facebook page he set up to run that effort, Stephen's Story, he describes himself as a ""teenager with incurable cancer just trying to enjoy life as much as possible, while raising funds for charity to help others."" And when his condition took a turn for the worse this spring, the news made national headlines. After rallying briefly, he was readmitted to a hospital Sunday with breathing difficulties. With typical fortitude, the last post he wrote said, ""Fingers crossed the issue will be resolved and that I'll be out of hospital soon, I'll keep you all updated with how I'm getting on."" On Tuesday, a message on his Facebook page from his family said that his breathing trouble was caused by the regrowth of tumors blocking his airways and that he was no longer able to communicate. A day later, his mother posted: ""My heart is bursting with pride but breaking with pain for my courageous, selfless, inspirational son who passed away peacefully in his sleep in the early hours of this morning, Wednesday 14th May. ""The ongoing support and outpouring of love for Stephen will help greatly at this difficult time, in the same way as it helped Stephen throughout his journey. We all know he will never be forgotten, his spirit will live on, in all that he achieved and shared with so many."" Since his death was announced, donations have poured in. The money Stephen raised went to the Teenage Cancer Trust, the charity that helped him through each surgery and each round of radiation and chemotherapy he underwent during nearly four years battling the disease.","Stephen Sutton, who was first diagnosed with cancer in 2010, has died at age 19 .

"(CNN)New federal law enforcement guidelines set to be issued Monday will expand protection from profiling, but won't apply to screenings at borders and airports, or in intelligence operations. The new guidelines replace ones in place since 2003, which prohibit profiling based on race and ethnicity, but also include broad exemptions for national security investigations. The Justice Department will issue the new guidelines that will prohibit profiling based on religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity, a Justice official said. The expanded ban on profiling comes amid widespread street protests around the nation in the wake of controversial killings of black men by white police officers. The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off wider discussions about police tactics and complaints by black men that they bear the brunt of suspicion and profiling by police. Attorney General Eric Holder in 2009 ordered a review of the profiling ban and pushed for an expansion. He ran into opposition along the way, including from the FBI, whose agents feared it would make their work more difficult, and more recently from the Homeland Security Department, which sought more flexibility for its agencies before agreeing to join the new policy. The new profiling guidelines apply to state and local law enforcement agencies when they are part of federal law enforcement operations. Holder plans to brief state and local law enforcement officials on a conference call Monday and plans to urge them to adopt the federal policy in a speech in Memphis on Tuesday, according to a Justice official. ""Profiling by law enforcement is not only wrong, it is profoundly misguided and ineffective -- because it wastes precious resources and undermines the public trust. Particularly in light of certain recent incidents we've seen at the local level -- and the widespread concerns about trust in the criminal justice process which so many have raised throughout the nation -- it's imperative that we take every possible action to institute strong and sound policing practices.,"" Holder said in a statement provided by the Justice Department in anticipation of Monday's announcement. DHS agencies, including federal air marshals, Homeland Security investigations, and the Coast Guard will be covered by the new policy. But screenings at ports of entry, including airports, are exempted from the profiling policy. The same applies to intelligence operations, which include federal agents' work to recruit informants. Despite the new broader ban on profiling, some critics aren't satisfied that it goes far enough. Rajdeep Singh, director of law and policy at the Sikh Coalition, said in a statement that ""the message this continues to send is that certain communities are still suspect, and we worry this will lead to more hate crime and discrimination."" Laura W. Murphy, legislative office director for the ACLU in Washington, said in a statement that the new guidance is ""not an adequate response to the crisis of racial profiling in America,"" arguing that the new guidelines are ""so loosely drafted"" and contain flexibility that can affect American Muslims. The group Muslim Advocates also argued the new rules don't go far enough in protecting American Muslims from profiling by the FBI, Customs and Border Protection, and other law enforcement agencies. ""We urge the administration to finish the job by addressing these outstanding, gaping problems with the Guidance,"" the group said in a statement.","Screenings at ports of entry, including airports, are exempt from the profiling policy .

"A postcard-sized painting bought as part of a job lot at an auction for $46 (£30) and left hidden away in a drawer for a decade has been identified as work by John Constable worth more than $390,000 (£250,000). Robin Darvell bought a cardboard box full of items including the small artwork -- which depicts a rural scene of trees, a bright blue sky and a meadow -- at a sale in Canterbury, southern England more than 10 years ago. Only a faint signature on the back of its gold frame hinted at its origin. But when Darvell passed the painting on to his son Robert, Darvell junior decided to look into the painting's story, and find out who painted it. Robert Darvell, 45, director of a film marketing company contacted fakes and forgeries expert Curtis Dowling from British TV show 'Treasure Detectives' who embarked on a year-long journey, analyzing the paint, canvas and signature to help solve the mystery. Read more: Mystery masterpiece a Rembrandt . ""It's a bit of a dream come true,"" said Robert. ""I was over the moon but also shocked when I found out what the painting really is. It hasn't really sunk in yet. ""It has an emotional value for me. I'm holding something in my hands that Constable painted,"" Darvell said. ""He's a very lucky man,"" said art expert Dowling. ""Most people assume it's too good to be true."" ""When people buy items at auctions that look like they could be worth something, they still wouldn't think they're walking away with a fortune."" Darvell and Dowling believe Constable painted the work as a gift for his father-in-law. It is thought never to have been on public display before. Read more: Mona Lisa model found in crypt? ""Rob certainly didn't expect a miracle,"" said Dowling. ""There are so many convincing forged paintings out there that people would first assume it is fake. Such paintings get lost for many reasons and mostly it looks like something but isn't in the end."" The painting is now tucked away in a bank vault for safe-keeping. Darvell hopes to have it restored before talking to museums to put it on display to the public. John Constable (1776 - 1837) was an English Romantic painter, famous for his landscapes of the English countryside, particularly scenes of his native Suffolk. Last year, the Constable painting ""The Lock"" became one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold, fetching £22.4m ($34.8 million) at an auction at Christie's in London.

"(CNN)As Tamir Rice's 14-year-old sister rushed to her brother's side upon learning he'd been shot, police officers ""tackled"" her, handcuffed her and placed her in a squad car with the Cleveland officer who shot Tamir, her mother and a Rice family attorney told reporters Monday. The mother, Samaria Rice, was threatened with arrest herself as she ""went charging and yelling at police"" because they wouldn't let her run to her son's aid, she said. Speaking at a Baptist church in Cleveland, Rice recalled how a seemingly normal November 22 morphed into tragedy as two Cleveland police officers pulled up to her son outside a recreation center across the street from her home. Within two seconds of exiting the police car, Officer Timothy Loehmann gunned down Tamir, 12. The boy died the next day. Tamir was playing with a pellet gun, and a witness who saw ""a guy with a pistol"" told 911 twice that it was ""probably"" fake but that Tamir was scaring people. It doesn't appear the 911 dispatcher relayed the information to Officers Loehmann, 26, and Frank Garmback, 46. Police have said that Loehmann, who has been criticized for his policing in the past, opened fire after Tamir reached for the gun in his waistband and that an orange tip indicating the gun was a toy had been removed. Rice said she didn't allow her son to play with toy guns, explaining that one of his friends had given it to him. The boy's mother recalled Monday how she got the news that the youngest of her four children had been shot. ""Two little boys came and knocked on my door and said, 'Police officers just shot your son twice in the stomach,' "" she said. At first, she didn't believe them but quickly realized they were telling the truth. ""I really thought they was playing, like joking around, but I saw the seriousness in their face, and it scared me,"" she said. She ran to the scene, admittedly frantic, and arrived at the same time as an ambulance. Officers wouldn't let her check on her son, she said, ""and then I saw my daughter in the back of a police car, the same one the shooter got out of."" Family attorney Walter Madison said police placed Tamir's sister in the car with Loehmann. Samaria Rice said she calmed down and asked police to release her daughter. They told her no, she said. Not only would they not release her daughter, but later, she said, they made her choose: Stay with her daughter or accompany her son to a hospital. She chose the latter but was told she couldn't ride in the back of the ambulance with her son, so she rode in the front seat on the way to the hospital, she said. ""The treatment of the family is unacceptable,"" said Councilman Jeffrey Johnson, who appeared alongside the family at the news conference. ""It just shows the lack of training when we shackle a grieving sister, threaten a grieving mother and not even take care of a child lying on the ground."" Cleveland police declined to discuss the family's allegations. Detective Jennifer Ciaccia told CNN, ""We're really not commenting further at this point."" In a lawsuit filed last week against the city and the two officers, the family says Loehmann and Garmback ""refused to provide any medical attention to Tamir for at least four minutes as he lay on the ground alive and bleeding."" Cleveland police Chief Calvin Williams has previously said that four minutes after Tamir was shot, a detective and FBI agent arrived and the FBI agent administered first aid. Paramedics arrived three minutes later, the chief said. Attorney Benjamin Crump said the Rice family is ""very distrustful"" of the justice system, and in light of the grand jury rulings in the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases, is demanding a transparent investigation. In contrast to the Brown and Garner cases, the family also wants the officers -- who are on paid leave -- charged before a grand jury hears the case, said Crump, who also represents the Brown family. ""There is nothing written anywhere in the law that says police officers are to be treated differently from any other citizen,"" Crump said. ""We cannot have children playing cops and robbers on a playground and police officers coming and claiming their lives."" Tamir was by himself in a gazebo when Garmback and Loehmann pulled onto the grass alongside the gazebo and got out of their car. From the dispatcher's failure to relay the report that the gun was probably fake to the haste with which Loehmann shot the sixth-grader, Crump said ""several things were done inappropriately,"" which is sufficient probable cause to charge the policemen. The family attorneys also called for the ouster of Safety Director Michael McGrath and Martin Flask, executive assistant to the mayor -- a call echoing one by Councilman Johnson, who asked for their resignations in a Cleveland newspaper last week after a Justice Department report that said Cleveland police had a pattern of excessive force. The family's primary objective, Crump said, is to ""hold the killer of their child accountable."" ""Tamir was a bright child. He had a promising future,"" his mother said, explaining that he was a talented artist, drummer and athlete. Asked what would represent justice in her eyes, Samaria Rice replied, ""I'm actually looking for a conviction.""","Tamir Rice' s mother said police threatened her when she arrived at scene of son's shooting .

"Race relations in the United States have ""certainly gotten better,"" despite widely-varying opinions on the criminal justice system's fairness, incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, the Kentucky Republican called pointed to South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican, who in November became the first black senator elected in the South since Reconstruction. ""It's undeniable there's been remarkable progress for African-Americans in this country. They've been elected senators and governors and running major corporations,"" he said. ""But obviously we still have a long way to go."" Will the Eric Garner case change things? Debates about race relations have raged since grand juries in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City failed to indict police officers accused of unnecessarily killing black citizens. Other top Republicans have said race relations have suffered under President Barack Obama, the country's first black president. One potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, recently said in an interview with Breitbart TV that, ""Things were better before this president was elected. And I think that things have gotten worse because of his unusual emphasis [on race]."" McConnell's comments come a day after a Bloomberg Politics poll found that 53 percent of Americans believe racial tensions have gotten worse under Obama. McConnell said he didn't want to assess Obama's role. ""People can draw their own conclusions,"" he said. ""I think we've come a long way but we probably have way more progress we need to make."" The criminal justice system should be trusted -- whether its outcomes are popular or not, McConnell said. ""Unfortunately, so much of the criminal justice system seems to be producing different reactions from different people based upon race,"" McConnell said. ""At the end of the day, though, we have to trust the criminal justice system. They bring together people to review evidence, to see whether an indictment is appropriate. ""When that happens some people like it and some don't. It's sort of like being a member of Congress. And, I think we're not happy with where we are, but we just have to keep working on it,"" he said.","Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says race relations in the United States have improved .

"Republican members of the New Jersey legislative committee investigating Gov. Chris Christie's involvement in the Bridgegate controversy blasted the panel's work, calling it ""a shiftless, broken political vehicle,"" in a report released Monday. Republicans also called for an independent investigation into whether the committee misused taxpayer money for political purposes. The committee met Monday to publicly release an interim report that failed to find any conclusive evidence tying Christie to the scandal. The report leaked to the press last week. But Republicans used the meeting as a platform to release their own ""minority statement,"" slamming Democratic co-chair John Wisniewski's handling of the probe into last year's lane closings on the George Washington Bridge. ""An opportunistic and power-hungry politician also used those reprehensible lane reassignments as cover, while leading a legislative committee to try to execute a two pronged political mission: take down Governor Chris Christie, the biggest political threat to state and national Democrats, and in so doing, become the next Democrat gubernatorial candidate,"" the report said. State Sen. Kevin O'Toole, a Christie ally, said during Monday's meeting that Republicans planned to forward their report to the office of the state Attorney General asking for an independent prosecutor to examine whether the committee misused taxpayer money for political purposes. ""The committee was formed to stack the partisan deck against Republicans in a way that was merely window dressing in the name of bipartisanship,"" O'Toole said. ""Co-chairs never shied away from the microphone and camera to spread their prejudicial and predetermined outcomes."" Wisniewski, meanwhile, said the process ""may well serve as a great example, perhaps the greatest example, of legislative oversight in our state's history."" He said that the committee was unable to interview key witnesses. The committee, he said, is ready to continue its work should more evidence become available.","A panel investigating New Jersey's Bridgegate controversy released its finding Monday .

"(CNN) -- From rappelling down waterfalls to zip-lining between mountains, Costa Rica has something for everyone who is adventurous at heart. Beyond the canopied forests, majestic waterfalls and impressive volcanoes, it remains a place full of wonder and magic. ""The country is teeming with so much wildlife and vegetation that you feel like you're stepping into a jungle book that is filled with beautiful pictures,"" iReporter Anna Berte said. ""There are so many things to do in Costa Rica that we left still only doing a minimum."" Road-tripping through Costa Rica . Although a small country, Costa Rica is brimming with opportunity for both adventure and relaxation. ""Costa Rica has it all, from the Atlantic to Pacific coast and everything in between,"" iReporter James Amerson said. ""Rain forests, volcanic activity and the best surf in the world -- very few places have such wonderful views packed into such a small country."" Below, iReporters share their tips for making the most out of your time in Costa Rica. Get adventurous . Costa Rica is an adventurer's paradise -- where else can you rappel waterfalls, hike volcanoes, zip-line through the forest and surf, all within miles of each other? ""On the east coast, you can find the still-active Arenal volcano where you can zip line next to it through the jungle canopy as it puffs gaseous steam and molten lava,"" Amerson said. ""Take a hike through the tropical rain forest in La Paz and gaze upon tremendous waterfalls."" Berte and her husband went to Costa Rica to have adventures as they crossed the country. They took an ATV ride to a zip-line course through the jungle, made more exciting by an unexpected encounter. ""This was especially fun because you get to experience the countryside and villages of Costa Rica by riding through them on an ATV, and then you cool off by zip lining through the tree tops in the jungle,"" Berte said. ""It's the first time you get really close to the howler monkeys who are lounging around as you zip by them. Choose the right zip course, and you can encounter a small wildlife preserve."" When in Costa Rica, enjoy the fruits of the rainforest . Berte also enjoyed surfing in Tamarindo, filled with plentiful waves, and visited the Arenal Volcano. ""It is a majestic mountain overlooking a lush jungle full of animals such as sloths and howling monkeys."" iReporter Jill Thornton had her heart set on zip-lining and went on several tours. She calls it a must-do activity while in Costa Rica. ""It was amazing to be flying so fast over the forest, with the coast off to the horizon -- something I'll never forget!"" she said. ""As long as you don't think about how high up you are, or about the things that could go wrong, it's one of the most amazing things to do! You just sit back and fly through the trees -- a dream come true."" Exploring Costa Rica . Costa Rica is known for its rainy season, and while it might seem daunting to some travelers, many consider it one of the best times to make your trip. Fewer people visit the country during the rainy season, and the rainfall makes the ""whole country lush with vegetation,"" according to iReporter Matthew Karsten. He also says that the rain isn't as unpleasant as it sounds. While adventure is always an option, you can also take the slow, scenic route and experience Costa Rica's other offerings. ""If you want to see a ton of animals, Corcovado National Park can't be beat,"" Karsten said. ""If you want to get away from the many tourist traps in Costa Rica, I'd recommend heading for Tenorio Volcano National Park and hike to the magical Rio Celeste Waterfall."" Small towns are also a good jumping-off point for exploring Costa Rica. Starting in these centers will round out the cultural experience of your trip. ""The town of Tamarindo itself is a small jewel,"" Berte said. ""It's teeming with life and is full of little shops and restaurants, enough to fill your souvenir scavenging for days. After exploring the town, we did sign up for several tours to explore the rest of Costa Rica."" iReporter Craig Smith, an avid photographer, was eager to explore Monteverde Cloud Forest, known for its wildlife. ""The beaches of Costa Rica are beautiful, but the Cloud Forest is one of a kind,"" he said. ""We spent 5 days searching for howler monkeys, three-toed sloths, toucans, butterflies and other creatures. The Cloud Forest is an amazing biosphere. The Arenal volcano is close by and erupts continually providing spectacular sights when the clouds permit. Take time to hike through the forest and experience what it has to offer."" Before you go . In addition to the difference in climate, planning the details for your trip to Costa Rica is crucial. Prepare to encounter insects of all kinds, so find a repellent that works for you, Berte said. ""Make sure your vaccinations are up to date before you visit Costa Rica,"" she said. ""Also, try to exchange your money before you get into the provinces, so you walk around with colon -- the Costa Rican equivalent to [dollars]. Always pay with colon first. Otherwise, go and have fun, no matter what your fear is, just let go and go for it, you only live once!"" iReporter Ariel Matias, who relocated to Costa Rica, recommends learning a bit of Spanish before you go, especially for first-timers. ""Ticos are very friendly people and appreciate foreigners who try to speak their language."" Perhaps most important of all, prepare for a brand new experience and leave yourself open to opportunity. Soak up the culture, try new adventures and leave with a bit of Costa Rica tucked alongside your heart. ""When you're in Costa Rica, try and immerse yourself in the culture while you're there -- eat food you wouldn't normally eat, walk around a town that doesn't have a lot of tourists, try and have a conversation with the people in their language -- it's a hospitable country, so it will welcome your efforts!"" Thornton said.","Costa Rica is brimming with opportunity for both adventure and relaxation .

"The White House announced Monday that the First Family's personal chef, Sam Kass, is leaving and will move to New York. Kass also heads up the First Lady's ""Let's Move!"" initiative, aimed at ending childhood obesity and promoting healthy eating habits among youth, and serves as the White House senior policy adviser on nutrition. First Lady Michelle Obama praised Kass for his work on improving nutrition for the nation. ""Sam leaves an extraordinary legacy of progress, including healthier food options in grocery store aisles, more nutritious school lunches, and new efforts that have improved how healthy food is marketed to our kids,"" she said. He's been one of Obama's key liaisons with the education community as she's sought to implement improved nutritional standards for school lunches. But that role has not been without controversy, as students have boycotted the lunches and the Student Nutrition Association, an organization that represents cafeteria workers and their allies, has argued the standards are too much of a burden on schools and students. Kass was, in fact, denied a request to speak at the SNA's annual convention this summer, after previously enjoying a warm and active partnership with the group in helping to publicize and implement the new standards. In the White House, however, Kass is a noncontroversial figure, a friend of the President who the first White House home-brewed. Indeed, he's so close with the Obamas that they attended his wedding with MSNBC host Alex Wagner. Obama said Kass has left ""an indelible mark"" on the White House. ""Over the years, Sam has grown from a close friend to a critical member of my team, and I am grateful for his outstanding work and look forward to seeing all that he will continue to achieve in the years ahead,"" the president said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- James Franco and Seth Rogen are going above and beyond for their new movie. The pair appeared Sunday in a special episode of the Discovery Channel series ""Naked and Afraid,"" and it was ... illuminating. The show features folks dropped into the wild sans clothing; they must then survive in the wilderness for 21 days. It was obvious that Sunday's episode was going to be a bit different for the Hollywood BFFs, whose new film ""The Interview"" is out December 25. ""I was hoping to be teamed up with a woman, but I guess Franco is the next best thing,"" Rogen said. ""He's pretty much hairless. Take your glasses off, he's pretty much a woman."" The naughty bits were blurred, but it didn't seem to matter to Franco, who clearly enjoyed the freedom. ""I'm actually really comfortable being naked,"" he said. ""If I could, I'd be naked all the time. It's just that I'm famous, and if I'm naked, everyone loves to talk about it, and it becomes an international event."" Participants are allowed to bring one item with them. The ever-practical Rogen brought toilet paper, while Franco brought sunglasses. It was obvious the latter took the adventure lightly as he exclaimed, ""Naked ain't afraid, even a little bit!"" What followed was plenty of comedy and some awkward spooning. Rogen and Franco have shown that they don't mind pushing the envelope. Rogen even dropped in on Saturday while Franco hosted ""Saturday Night Live."" They joked about the recent hack of Sony, the studio behind their new film, claiming that the hackers had gotten hold of some sensitive photos of them together.

"Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he plans to endorse his Kentucky colleague, Rand Paul, in his widely expected bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. ""I'm almost certainly going to be doing that at some point,"" McConnell said Monday in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash. His comments -- a month after telling the Lexington Herald-Leader that he'd back Paul in ""whatever he decides to do"" in 2016 -- could enhance Paul's credibility with the GOP donor class. They also underscore how quickly Paul has been embraced by institutional figures to whom his father, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, was always an outsider. Don't expect to see McConnell on the campaign trail, though. ""I'm going to be helpful to him in any way I can be, but I'm not going to be tromping around in New Hampshire and Iowa, I can tell you that,"" he said. In backing Paul, McConnell will be choosing a favorite out of a Senate Republican caucus that includes several other potential candidates for president -- including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. Just four years ago, the two Kentucky Republicans were squaring off against each other in a Senate primary -- with Paul defeating McConnell's choice for the seat, Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson. But they've grown closer since then, as Paul helped McConnell fend off a conservative primary challenge and win a hard-fought 2014 re-election campaign against Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes. ""We started off on opposite paths, but we've become great allies. I'm a big fan of his. I think he's a very, very smart, capable guy,"" McConnell said. ""We've become real allies.

"Jerusalem (CNN)Israeli lawmakers voted to dissolve the nation's parliament Monday amid mounting political upheaval. The bill dissolving the 120-seat Knesset passed with 93 votes in favor. No one voted against it. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called for the dissolution as he sacked two senior members of his coalition Cabinet for criticizing government policy. Last week the speaker of the Knesset said new elections would likely be held on March 17. The moves come at a tenuous time in Israel, which has been beset by a number of recent terrorist attacks against citizens in Jerusalem. The head of the right-wing Likud party, Netanyahu has been Israel's Prime Minister since 2009. But he's had to rely on members of other parties -- many of them to the left of Likud on the political spectrum -- to govern. Netanyahu told reporters last week that a divided government was one of Israel's problems, saying there was a lot of debate, contradictions and ultimatums. He ordered letters of dismissal for Finance Minister Yair Lapid and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, two members of his Cabinet from rival parties. ""During the last few weeks and, in particular, the last few days, the ministers have intensely attacked the government that I am leading,"" Netanyahu said. ""... I will not tolerate ministers attacking the government's policy and its head from inside the government."" The call for new elections means Israel is effectively in a state of political paralysis until March. Israel held its last election just 22 months ago. A poll for Israel's Channel 2 suggested that 55% of those surveyed were against another election being held so soon. Monday's vote makes the 19th Knesset one of the shortest serving parliaments in Israel's 66-year history, according to Natan Sachs, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle East Policy in Washington. The moves come at a tumultuous time for Israel, Sachs wrote in an opinion column for CNN.com last week. ""With the dramatic challenges Israel faces, domestically, regionally and internationally, expect the sense of malaise in Israeli politics to deepen,"" he wrote. ""These elections may simply be a prelude to a deeper political crisis."" CNN's Michael Schwartz reported from Jerusalem. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet wrote the story in Atlanta. CNN's Ben Wedeman and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Lawmakers vote to dissolve the Knesset, leaving Israel in political paralysis .

"(CNN) -- As the country searches its soul in the wake of the recent wave of questionable killings by police, Americans of all races are struggling with a distressing sense of deja vu. This is not the first time we have struggled with this anguish and it will not be the last. But there may be a new prospect for hope this time. Perhaps more than at any point in the country's history, Americans are open to changing the way they look at police violence. If so, we can begin by enhancing the perception of fairness of the official response when police use deadly force. Much of the anger being expressed across the country comes from the fact that after these deaths, the criminal justice system -- widely perceived as eager to prosecute young black men -- suddenly seems toothless when invoked in their defense. That perception needs to change. Importantly, the problem is not (as many have suggested) that the prosecutors in Ferguson and Staten Island presented exculpatory evidence to the respective grand juries. True, prosecutors do not normally present the defense side when seeking an indictment. But a typical case with substantial defense evidence (for example, bystanders who support the defendant's account and corroborating physical evidence) never gets to a grand jury in the first place. The grand jurors in Ferguson and Staten Island were doing something different from what typical grand jurors do. They were taking the place of the prosecutor, deciding, as the prosecutor would normally do, whether to bring criminal charges. While we generally trust prosecutors to make charging decisions, there is good reason not to trust them when the suspect is a police officer. Local prosecutors and police work closely together and form tight bonds. The grand jury should make the charging decision in these cases, both in terms of actual fairness and public perception. If the grand jury is acting as the prosecutor, however, it must see all the evidence. One of the worst outcomes of recent events would be if prosecutors and grand jurors internalize the notion that the public wants cases to advance to trial notwithstanding substantial doubts about guilt. There are already thousands of defendants across the country jailed pending trial, trying to choose between pleading guilty to a shaky charge or risking a much higher sentence at trial. Ask them whether prosecutors and grand jurors should be encouraged to defer objective assessments of guilt until trial. The problem in the response of Ferguson and Staten Island criminal justice officials wasn't that they presented all the evidence to the jury -- it was who was presenting that evidence. As commentators have correctly pointed out, prosecutors wield tremendous influence over a grand jury. If we don't trust prosecutors to make the decision of whether to charge, it makes no sense to give them the task of presenting the evidence that controls that decision. Police deadly force cases should go to grand juries, and the grand jurors should see all the relevant evidence, but the presentation should be guided not by a prosecutor, but by a ""special counsel,"" an attorney completely independent of the local police and prosecuting authority. There is a model for this approach. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division employs skilled prosecutors whose primary task is prosecuting wayward police officers. If those prosecutors determine, for example, that a police officer such as Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown while Brown stood still, arms up (as some witnesses alleged), a federal criminal civil rights prosecution can be brought and won. The process will be similar to what we have already seen. The federal prosecutors will convene a grand jury, present the evidence supporting a civil rights charge (that Wilson deprived Brown of his right to trial by, in essence, executing him) and, this time, get an indictment. But the federal prosecutors may find the evidence does not support that narrative, and if so, will not proceed. Not because there is a ""high bar"" to federal prosecution as some reporting suggests, but because there is not enough evidence to go to trial. And the public will likely accept the federal prosecutors' judgment because it is not clouded by affinity for the police involved. The federal model, however, is just that, a model. As the country is witnessing, deadly force cases are all too common. The federal government does not have the resources to investigate them all. State and local authorities must fill the gap. As they rethink their role, states should adopt a first step of providing for an independent, special counsel to investigate police deadly force cases -- stepping in for the local prosecutor and presenting evidence to the grand jury. While this reform will not stamp out instances of unjustified deadly force, it will give the public greater confidence that the government values the life and liberty of all its citizens, not just police officers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Bellin.","Bellin: Criminal justice system appears eager to prosecute black men but not to defend their rights .
To restore confidence in justice, local prosecutors shouldn't present police shootings to grand juries, he says .
Special counsel wouldn't be compromised by ties to local police, he says ."
"The Senate will send President Barack Obama legislation authorizing the use of military force against ISIS shortly after the GOP takes majority control in January, presumed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, the Kentucky Republican said he'd like to see Obama ask Congress for such a measure -- but that one is coming anyway. ""It would be even better if the President asked us for what he wants, but we're not going to wait forever,"" McConnell said. ""We're certainly going to need to use force, there's no question about it. They're beheading Americans and posting it on the Internet. They're a serious threat to our national security. And we're going to have to act,"" he said. He signaled that crafting legislation green-lighting military action, which is already underway against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, could be an item on which Republicans could work with Obama. ""I think the President is moving in that direction himself,"" McConnell said. ""He'd be in a much stronger position with an authorization of the use of military force. We've been sort of expecting him to ask for it, but if he doesn't, I think he will get one sometime soon after the first of the year."" The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will start its debate on authorizing the use of military force against ISIS this week. Secretary of State John Kerry is set to appear before the panel Tuesday. Meanwhile, Sens. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, and Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, are pushing for a vote on a bill that would approve U.S. action. That measure, though, wouldn't advance in time for a vote before senators are expected to wrap up their post-election ""lame duck"" session and leave Washington. McConnell said he doesn't want a vote in December, but that with the new Republican majority in place in January, ""We'll address it at the beginning of next year."" In the interview, McConnell previewed his plans for the final two years of Obama's tenure -- saying he expects the Senate to pass legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline, forcing the President into a tough veto decision, and to ""push back against this overactive bureaucracy"" on environmental regulations. He also said he expects votes to repeal Obama's signature health care law, as well as some of its key components, including the individual mandate that all Americans have health insurance and its tax on medical device-makers. But McConnell, pointing to a meeting with Obama last week, said Republicans might be able to agree with the President on a few issues. ""It would be better, obviously, if we can get some results. And he and I had an opportunity to talk last week. And we agreed to talk about the things that we might agree on,"" McConnell said. ""And there are some,"" he said. ""Trade agreements. There may be a path forward on comprehensive tax reform. We have certainly a lot of bipartisan interest in the crumbling infrastructure in the country and what to do about it. My first choice is to make progress for the country."" McConnell said his meeting with Obama was ""unusual -- we've not had a chance to talk very much."" But he said that's no surprise, since the President took office with hefty Democratic majorities and the party kept control of the Senate until November. McConnell said he's ""not opposed to negotiating with the administration."" ""Now he needs to talk to us and that's good, because when the American people elect divided government, they're not saying they don't want anything done,"" McConnell said. ""What they are saying is they want things done in the political center, things that both sides can agree on. And in the conversation last week, we talked about the things where there may be some agreement."" McConnell left the door open to congressional action on immigration -- which both McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had said would be made much more difficult by Obama's executive action halting deportations for the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. ""What we're going to do is try to figure out the best way to respond to what the President has done. We know we have a broken immigration system. We know the border is not secure. We know that we need an expansion in H1-B visas. We need an improvement in the agricultural guest worker program,"" McConnell said. ""There are a whole lot of things that need to be done to improve our immigration system. And I hope the President had made it possible for us to -- to deal with those issues.""","Mitch McConnell says the Senate will vote on a bill authorizing military action against ISIS in early 2015 .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Opium production in southeast Asia's ""Golden Triangle"" has tripled since 2006, fueling an illicit drugs trade worth $16.3 billion, a new United Nations report says. Poppy cultivation in Myanmar and Laos stood at 63,800 hectares in 2014, compared with 61,200 hectares in 2013 -- increasing for an eighth year, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime said in its Southeast Asia Opium Survey 2014. The region produced approximately 762 tons of opium, which was most likely made into 76 tons of heroin, it said. Myanmar accounts for the vast majority of the region's poppy cultivation. Production is particularly entrenched in the northern Shan State, near the Chinese border, where it's a staple part of the economy and helps fund rebel groups, the report added. ""Surveys of farmers indicate that, for many, the money made from poppy cultivation is an essential part of family income and support,"" said Yury Fedetov, the executive director of the United Nations on Drugs and Crime, said. ""Villages threatened with food insecurity and poverty need sustainable alternatives, or they will have little choice beyond growing this cash crop out of desperation,"" he added. The report said there had been an increase in heroin use in China, Laos, Singapore and Thailand in 2014, driving demand for opium. The Golden Triangle -- a fabled area that straddles the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand along the Mekong River -- was once the largest heroin-producing area in the world but eradication efforts in the late 1990s and early 2000s saw cultivation fall. But production has seen a resurgence since 2006 thanks in part to closer regional integration and better transport infrastructure boosting trade. Afghanistan is the world's biggest cultivator of opium poppies.","Opium production in southeast Asia's ""Golden Triangle"" increases for eighth year .

"A woman who allegedly stabbed a U.S. teacher at a mall in the United Arab Emirates committed a ""personal terrorist act,"" an official told the nation's official news agency. The official said she logged on to ""terrorist websites"" recently, according to the WAM news agency. The suspect, who has not been identified, is accused of killing 47-year-old American teacher Ibolya Ryan last week in the restroom of an upscale mall in Abu Dhabi. The accused is a female Emirati national of Yemeni descent, the UAE's Interior Ministry said. Police say they think Ryan, who was the mother of three children, did not know the attacker. Her death came two months after the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi issued a statement warning U.S. citizens of an anonymous Internet post that encouraged attacks against teachers at American and other international schools. The embassy said it was unaware of any specific, credible threat at that time. Veteran teacher . Ryan was born in Romania and had American and Hungarian citizenship. She had been a teacher for 17 years, according to a Footprints Recruiting profile of her. Last year, she began teaching in Abu Dhabi, where she lived with her children. Before that, she taught special education in her ex-husband's native Colorado. Surveillance video released by police shows the moments before and after the mall stabbing. A veiled figure police identified as the attacker walks calmly through a parking lot entrance, speaks to security guards and picks up a paper before disappearing around a corner and out of sight. The video later shows the suspect running to an elevator and leaving the mall through the same parking lot doors. Reem Island, where the attack occurred, is a newly developed area popular with expatriates in the capital. The motive of the killing was still unclear. Ex-husband speaks out . Ryan's ex-husband said he was shocked by the fatal stabbing but still feels safe in the UAE. ""I'm totally horrified by what happened,"" Paul Ryan said. ""One just needs to look at the video, the images of that bathroom, and it knocks you out. It knocks you out."" But he said UAE authorities have gone out of their way to ensure his family is taken care of and have offered to pay for his three children's education through college. ""They are treating me like family now,"" he said. ""They have expressed almost precisely in these terms, the children will not have to worry about their education, for their entire education basically."" Ryan could ultimately have the power to commute a death sentence if the suspect is found guilty and given capital punishment. Under UAE law, the victim's family must give their consent in order for a death sentence to be commuted. The burden weighs heavily on him, he said. ""As far as I can tell, it seems pretty damning evidence, and she (the suspect) confessed herself,"" Ryan said. ""Ibolya, my dear ex-wife, and I do mean that, will not have died in vain.""","American Ibolya Ryan, 47, was stabbed in a restroom at a high-end mall, police say .

"Combat strikes against ISIS have put the terror group on the defensive, the commander of U.S. military operations against ISIS said Monday. ""(ISIS) operationally is probably on the defense to hold what they have gained,"" Gen. James Terry, commander of Operation Inherent Resolve, told reporters in Kuwait. Coalition airstrikes have caused ISIS to have difficulty moving and communicating. ""Initially we saw a lot of movement ... with technical vehicles, heavy machine guns,"" he said. ""It was a very mobile force but quite frankly when they stick their head up now, we make sure that capability is degraded."" Still, he said the group is ""able to conduct some limited attacks"" to support their messaging. Countries in the region and NATO members will send an additional 1,500 troops to combat ISIS, which Terry called a ""threat to region.""  The additional forces will be there to ""build partner capacity,"" meaning training Iraqi security forces and advising and assisting operations. The United States already has 1,500 American troops in Iraq. The pledge was made during what he called an ""outstanding conference"" in the region held December 2-3. ""One of the priorities is to build this coalition and hold this coalition together,"" he said. Terry said he didn't currently see the need for U.S. ground troops in the form of ground controllers for airstrikes or forward deployed operations, but like Joint Chiefs Chairman, Gen. Martin Dempsey, Terry said should the need arise, he would ""certainly ask for it."" The focus now, he said, is on balancing the commitments from other nations. ""A lot of coalition members come together with different capabilities,"" he said. Iraqi security forces on the ground are also making progress, conducting 15 operations so far, including the recapture of the Mosul dam and the Baiji oil refinery, two key infrastructure targets. Still the commander said they could still be months or years away from launching major offensive operations.

"(CNN) -- Composer Richard Wagner was an anti-Semite whose music was used, after his death, as Nazi propaganda. He was also, as some say, ""one of the most gifted, historically important composers to ever grace the planet."" So fans of his music, including those in Israel, are willing to overlook his hideous views and embrace his art. This is what is generally considered separating the art from the artist. As writer Jay Parini put it, ""Hideous people can make great art."" Since TV Land canceled syndication of ""The Cosby Show"" recently in reaction to multiple allegations that Bill Cosby is a rapist, I've been thinking more about whether we can separate the art from the artist. For a certain generation, ""The Cosby Show"" had a huge impact. I was 7 years old when ""The Cosby Show"" premiered, and over the course of eight seasons, I grew up with Rudy, Vanessa, Theo and Denise, Sondra, Clair and, yes, Cliff, the father character played by Cosby. Given the history and context of race in America, it was amazing for middle-class white kids growing up in Whiteville to see a middle-class black family that in many ways resembled their own. For black kids (let alone adults) growing up in America, it must have been transformative to see on TV a happy, successful, normal black family such as the Huxtables. Black people had been poorly depicted on television for as long as the medium existed, and in mostly negative light. So when TV Guide called the Huxtables ""the most atypical black family in television history,"" it implicitly contrasted them not only with fictional black TV characters, but also with the ""welfare queens"" and ""crack addicts"" whom conservative politicians criticized. In such a context, that the Huxtables were normal was actually radical. ""It is hard to believe that Bill Cosby is a serial rapist because the belief doesn't just indict Cosby, it indicts us,"" wrote Ta-Nehisi Coates in The Atlantic. ""It damns us for drawing intimate conclusions about people based on pudding-pop commercials and popular TV shows."" Cliff Huxtable may have been just a TV character, but he was also a symbol, and Cosby appeared to embody his positive virtues. I think some of our collective reluctance to believe more than a dozen women who have accused Bill Cosby of rape stems from our desire to preserve the cultural significance of ""The Cosby Show."" We drew feel-good conclusions about Bill Cosby the man from pudding-pop commercials and TV shows not just because he wanted us to, but because we wanted to. It's ""difficult to believe something so sinister about a public figure as beloved as Bill Cosby. He gave us Fat Albert, The Cosby Show and A Different World,"" wrote Roxane Gay in The Guardian. ""We ask ourselves, How could a talented comedian -- a family man, a philanthropist -- also be a serial rapist?"" In a way, ""The Cosby Show"" is like a surrealist work of art attacking our illusions of normalcy. The picture-perfect dad in the show may turn out to be a real-life serial rapist. Illusions are easy to believe, but reality is harsh. Yet the art often survives -- along with, by association, the artist. Just look at Woody Allen. Earlier this year, Allen's daughter Dylan Farrow resurfaced allegations that Allen had molested her when she was a child. There's also the controversy surrounding Allen's affair with his ex-wife Mia Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi, whom he later married. All of this has seemingly done little to tarnish Allen's career. He continued to enjoy commercial and artistic success with his films. He even received the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes in 2014. There's also the filmmaker Roman Polanski. In 1977, when he was 43 years old, he was arrested for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl during a photo shoot. Polanski was indicted on six criminal charges and pleaded guilty, but fled America before sentencing. Since then, from exile, he has produced and directed several award-winning films. And a petition from Hollywood dignitaries calling for Polanski to be pardoned includes Martin Scorsese, Tilda Swinton, David Lynch and Woody Allen. In 2009, singer Chris Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault after beating up his then-girlfriend Rihanna. His third studio album, ""Graffiti,"" released later that year took a hit. But a few years late, his album ""F.A.M.E."" did great. The fans liked his music despite his previous bad behavior. Of course, Cosby hasn't been convicted of anything. But given that over a dozen women have come forward with claims of a similar pattern of sexual assault, the allegations should be taken very seriously. Will Bill Cosby's artistic legacy and reputation survive? We won't know until the dust has settled. But ""The Cosby Show"" seems undoubtedly tarnished. It's hard to watch it now, knowing what we've heard about Cosby, and not feel slimy and somehow complicit in his alleged crimes. But at the same time, turning off the show seems too easy -- it's not unlike the way we turn away from our discomfort with rape and rape victims. Maybe it's better if we squirm with the ugly picture for a while.","Sally Kohn: It's hard to reconcile Bill Cosby the man with Bill Cosby the talent .
Kohn: Amid allegations of rape, can we still enjoy the Cosby show?

Other picks were ""Fargo"" the year's best TV show, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson for best TV performances, and ""Key & Peele"" for best breakthrough TV show. Comedian Jenny Slate's movie ""Obvious Child"" was the best discovery and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" best blockbuster. Brain training app Elevate is the company's pick for best app of the year and ""Threes!"" is the best game of the year. Runaway true-crime hit ""Serial"" was anointed the best new podcast of the year. ""Serial"" is still iTunes' most downloaded podcast around the world right now, having been downloaded 5 million times.","Apple releases its lists of most downloaded movies, TV shows and music for 2014 .

"Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and vice presidential pick, is headed to Iowa next month for a conservative gathering that will showcase no fewer than nine potential 2016 presidential contenders. She's one of the confirmed speakers at the inaugural Iowa Freedom Summit, an event organized by Iowa Rep. Steve King and conservative group Citizens United to ""bring grassroots activists from across Iowa to hear directly from national conservative leaders,"" per its website. The event is scheduled for Jan. 24. Palin raised eyebrows last Spring when she said she'd ""never say never"" to a 2016 presidential run, and remains a star within the conservative wing of the GOP, but there's little indication she's moving forward with preparations for a bid. If she ran, she'd face stiff competition for conservative support from a wide array of Republicans, many of whom will join her at the Iowa Freedom Summit. Confirmed speakers for the event include Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, physician Ben Carson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Republican National Committee fundraiser Carly Fiorina — all of whom are openly contemplating a presidential run or haven't ruled it out. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the incoming chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, is also slated to speak. The event will give the potential contenders the opportunity to test the waters with Iowa grassroots Republicans, which are key to any conservative presidential contender's chances. A strong showing in the Iowa caucuses, the first contest of the presidential primary, signals to major donors and conservatives in other states that a candidate is a viable option for the nomination. Notably missing from the first round of confirmed speakers is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has made no secret of his interest in running. His father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, posted a surprising third-place finish in the state's caucuses in 2012, but the Pauls' influence on the state has waned some in recent years.","The Iowa Freedom Summit is scheduled for Jan. 24, 2015 .

"(CNN)It's easy to forget that some of the world's biggest corporations were not always that big. Many started small, with just one visionary person fueled by one innovative idea -- often working out of a garage, a shed or a backroom basement. Amazon began as an online bookstore run out of founder Jeff Bezos' garage, before growing into the world's largest online retailer. And technology-giant Apple started with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak selling computers out of the same improbable abode. The humble beginnings of Amazon, Apple, and countless other companies in developed but also developing countries show that one visionary person fueled by one great idea can be a game-changer. When fighting climate change, that same spirit of entrepreneurship is vital. Governments have set a goal of limiting average global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Achieving this requires a move towards climate neutrality in the second half of the century. Innovation, entrepreneurship and vision are critically important elements to meeting this goal. The good news is that there are thousands of examples of entrepreneurs around the world who are finding a constantly expanding market for their solutions -- they are part of the United Nations Climate Change secretariat's Momentum for Change initiative. Meet the Solar Queen of Southeast Asia . Take Wandee Khunchornyakong in Thailand. She began her career by connecting rural villages with solar power. Khunchornyakong built a modest manufacturer of photovoltaic solar panels into a multi-million dollar industry, leading to the company's public offering and her early retirement in 2007. She spotted an opportunity and seized upon it. Observing regulatory changes in Thailand's energy market, she visited the local authority to obtain more permits to build solar farms. The clerk she spoke to said: ""Please take more since no one else wants them."" This fed Khunchornyakong's vision of sunny northeast Thailand as a global leader in large-scale solar energy. She leveraged funding from the International Finance Corporation toward her vision, building Thailand's largest solar power generation company. Today, the Solar Power Company Group drives growth in the photovoltaic market across Southeast Asia. Recognizing leadership matters. In doing so, we inspire others to take similar entrepreneurial action. Khunchornyakong's business is just one of 12 innovative climate solutions that the United Nations Climate Change secretariat will showcase at the upcoming round of climate talks beginning this week in Lima, Peru. In numbers . Action on climate change has reached a tipping point. This past September, 400,000 people participated in the largest ever global protest calling for action on climate change. A few weeks ago, in an unprecedented series of announcements, 21 countries pledged a total of up to $9.6 billion to enable the world to move to a low-emission, climate-resilient future. Earlier, the United States and China likewise announced a historic agreement to reduce their emissions. The European Union committed to ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Over the next 15 years some $90 trillion will be invested in infrastructure globally -- greening this will require big, medium-sized, and small entrepreneurial companies. All great endeavors have humble beginnings. Somewhere in the world, there is an entrepreneur in a garage or a duka designing the next game-changing climate solution that offers yet another catalyst towards a healthier, greener and more secure world.

"(CNN) -- Oklahoma's governor ordered every state highway, interstate and turnpike closed Thursday night, hours after declaring a statewide emergency because of a major winter storm battering the state and the rest of the central U.S. ""I am urging all Oklahomans to take winter storm precautions and stay off the roads unless travel is absolutely necessary,"" Gov. Brad Henry said earlier in the day after declaring a state of emergency. ""This is a very serious winter storm, and we want Oklahomans to stay safe."" Heavy snow and limited visibility has left treacherous road conditions in Oklahoma on Christmas Eve, snarling holiday travel, according to CNN affiliate KOCO-TV. In Midwest City, Oklahoma, nearly 50 vehicles were involved in a chain-reaction accident, the station reported. The quickly accumulating snow also caused the roof collapse of a well-known, landmark furniture store in Oklahoma City, officials told KOCO-TV. One motorist was killed Thursday in the storm on Interstate 44, south of Lawton, Oklahoma, Comanche County Public Information Officer Chris Killmer told CNN. Killmer said there are hundreds of car accidents and stranded motorists in Comanche County. He said officials were still sending out people to find stranded motorists. They had already rescued between 65 and 70 from the conditions Thursday. A band of extremely heavy snow, capable of producing up to 4 inches of snow per hour, and isolated thunder was moving into northeast Oklahoma Thursday night, according to the National Weather Service. Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City reported 13 inches of snow and was closed Thursday night. The airport's Web site said it did not expect to re-open Thursday night but should be open Friday morning. In the past 106 years, residents of Oklahoma City have only awakened to snow six times on Christmas morning, CNN's Sean Morris said. Blizzard warnings have been issued for central and southwestern Oklahoma, including Oklahoma City, and parts of northwestern Texas. Blizzard warnings also were issued for Nebraska, extreme western Iowa, western Missouri, North Dakota, much of north-central and northeastern South Dakota, and the Duluth area in Minnesota. The Minneapolis Department of Transportation urged motorists to stay off the road Thursday night, saying it would be ""life-threatening"" based on forecasts from the Weather Service. The Minneapolis-St. Paul area had received about 4 to 7 inches of snow Thursday night from the storm, CNN affiliate KARE-TV reported. Minnesota State Patrol Capt. Matt Langer told CNN that between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Thursday, the department had responded statewide to 630 calls regarding vehicles that went off the roadway, 276 property damage crashes and 60 personal injury crashes. He said there were no fatalities in any of those accidents, though one person was killed in a storm-related accident Wednesday night. Northwest Texas has already seen between 3 and 7 inches of snow with 4-foot drifts, Morris said. The Weather Service is forecasting up to 2 inches of snow in northwestern suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro. ""Anyone with travel plans over the Christmas holiday period should keep up to date with the latest weather information,"" said the Weather Service office in Duluth, Minnesota. ""It should be emphasized that dangerous travel conditions will exist across most of the region from late tonight through Christmas."" A Louisiana man was killed Thursday when strong wind caused a tree to fall on his house, police told CNN affiliate KATC in Lafayette. Police in Scott, just outside Lafayette, identified the victim as Ryan Hebert, 44. Localized flooding was reported in and around Little Rock, Arkansas, after heavy rain fell throughout Wednesday night and Thursday morning. An ice storm warning has been lifted for most of the Chicago metro area, but continues in the far southeastern suburbs. An ice storm warning is also in effect for the mountains of North Carolina and southwestern Virginia. A winter storm watch is in effect for the mountains of western Virginia and northeastern West Virginia. Over a quarter-inch of ice is expected on trees, power lines, overpasses, bridges and highways. But the freezing rain is expected to change over to rain later Thursday, and road conditions in the area are expected to improve across the region by midafternoon Thursday. Flood watches, warnings and advisories have been issued for much of Missouri and Illinois, where several inches of rain is causing flooding in streams and rivers. The inclement weather is the second major storm system to hit the United States in a week. Last weekend, a nor'easter blanketed a swath of the East Coast in snow, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights. CNN's Sean Morris and Mallory Simon contributed to this report.","NEW: Oklahoma governor orders state roads, interstates, turnpikes closed after declaring emergency .

"A judge threw out a  high-profile murder case Monday against Shrien Dewani, who was accused of killing his wife while they were on their honeymoon in South Africa. Judge Jeanette Traverso called the state's case ""weak"" and said evidence fell ""far below"" the standard needed for conviction. It took years for prosecutors to bring him to trial over the killing of his wife, Anni. Dewani, 34, was accused of hiring hit men to kill her in Cape Town in November 2010. He has repeatedly denied orchestrating the killing, pleading not guilty at the start of the trial in October. South African authorities were locked in a three-year court battle to get Dewani extradited from the UK to face trial. But after the prosecution put forward its witnesses, the defense sought to have the charges dropped, citing a lack of evidence. Differences seen in witnesses' accounts . Traverso found there was no reasonable chance a court would convict Dewani unless he took the stand and incriminated himself, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said Monday. Other witnesses contradicted each other and could not be taken at face value because they were accomplices to the killing of Anni Dewani, Phelps explained. She said it was likely that the judge's decision would be the end of the case, because the prosecution ""can only appeal if the judge erred on a matter of law."" Addressing reporters outside the court, National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesman Nathi Mncube referred to ""a lack of understanding"" in the case. ""Firstly we have three people who have been convicted in this case, ideally you would want to have all conspirators all tried together at the same time, but unfortunately that could not happen, not because of the NPA or anyone else, but because of the fact that we could not extradite Mr. Dewani in time so that he could be tried with the other three accused,"" Mncube said. The killing took place during a taxi ride through a township on the edge of Cape Town, just over two weeks after the couple's wedding. The taxi driver, Zola Tongo, confessed within weeks of the bride's death that he had hired two men to kill her. In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said Dewani paid him to carry out the killing and to make it look as though the couple were the victims of a carjacking. Tongo was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the killing. His two accomplices also received lengthy sentences for their role in the crime. One of them died of brain cancer in October, The Guardian reported. Family hoping for answers . Dewani, a care home owner, returned to the United Kingdom after his wife's death. He avoided extradition to South Africa on mental health grounds during a lengthy court battle, but he was eventually sent back in April to face trial. What's life like in a South African prison? Psychiatric experts said that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and that he'd tried to take his life. Before his extradition, he was held at a secure mental health unit in southwest England. But in August, he was declared fit to stand trial after undergoing psychiatric observation, according to South African media. An indictment in the case said he faced charges including conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder and kidnapping, the South African Press Association reported. Dewani, from Bristol in southwest England, said his wife was the victim of a carjacking and denied any involvement in the killing.","Shrien Dewani was accused of orchestrating the killing of his wife in Cape Town .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. You can sell your skills, your time or your used stuff to make some extra money. With an abundance of job losses, salary cuts, eliminated bonuses and diminished 401(K) matching contributions, your income is shrinking -- but the bills aren't. If your regular job isn't earning you enough cash or you've lost your job altogether, these simple side gigs can help put some padding in your pockets until -- maybe even after -- you get back on your feet. Here are 10 ways real people are creatively taking home some extra dough: . 1. Do freelance work . Felice Premeau Devine left her lucrative, full-time job two years ago to raise her son. In the interim, she's picked up writing and editing freelance work and started a blog, where she is able to earn a little cash from advertising. Nowadays, almost any job can be done on a contract or freelance basis. Check out sites like Sologig, which lead job seekers to contract, consulting, freelance, temp-to-hire and part-time project opportunities in your field. 2. Sell your books . If you're a college student or you hung on to your college textbooks thinking you might want to read them again somewhere down the line, select retailers like Barnes & Noble allow you to sell your textbooks for some quick cash. Or, take some classics from your personal library and sell them at a local second-hand bookstore. 3. Search circulating coinage . Susan Headley, the ""guide to coins"" on About.com, is a lifetime coin collector who has been boosting her income by searching through circulating coinage for the past six years. In 2008, she made about $2,500 and so far in 2009, she has earned approximately $500 from coins she's found. People who search circulating coinage successfully for a side income do so in very large numbers, she says. They buy rolls of coins from banks, typically in whole boxes, and sort through it to find stuff that just doesn't belong, Headley says. Half dollars, for example, were no longer made from 90 percent silver after 1965, but they still had 40 percent silver in them until 1970; either of these turn a nice profit. Presidential dollar errors can be worth $50 to $5,000 each; uncirculated state quarters can sell from $10 to $50 per roll; and rare error coins can value up to $35,000. 4. Start a ""business"" Turn your hobby, skills or expertise into a part-time business. Sites like Jobvana can help you do so by providing you with free tools to market your services and offer specialized skills to those looking for help. Peter Olson says he built a profile in September 2008 offering to teach guitar lessons. He has since gained two students, earning about $240 extra dollars per month and grossing around $1,000 since he started teaching. 5. Enter local and online sweepstakes . Wendy Limauge has been entering sweepstakes since 1993 and teaching others to win through her Web site, Sweeties Sweeps, since 2002. Though winning sweepstakes rarely provides actual cash, her winnings have consistently provided her and her family with 200 to 300 prizes a year, many of them large items she and her husband couldn't afford on their incomes alone. Prizes she has won include three TVs, two of which are flat-screens; a home theatre system; three dishwashers, each won on separate occasions; at least $1,500 in grocery gift certificates; an $18,000 voucher for the vehicle of her choice; a trip to France valued at $25,000; and, in March 2009, she won $5,000 in an instant-win game. ""The Internet has so many options for saving money, getting something for free, winning a prize or earning money from home,"" Limauge says. ""You just need to find those resources that offer helpful information and point you in the right direction to get you started and keep you motivated."" 6. Give your opinion -- and get paid . Linda Childers, a California-based freelance writer, says many of her friends participate in focus groups. Contributing an hour of your time can earn you up to $100, sometimes more. Online surveys, phone surveys and product trials can also earn you anywhere from $5 to $150. Check out Free Paid Surveys or FindFocusGroups. 7. Sell your junk . Terri Jay earns $2,000 - $3,000 per month just by selling junk. On eBay, Jay not only sells stuff she isn't using; she hits up local thrift stores on 99-cent days, garage sales and tack sales, looking for things of which she knows the value. She says her best sale was for a drink tray from the 70s: She paid 25 cents for it and it sold for $87. ""The trick is to [sell] what you know,"" she advises. ""Therefore you can list them [at correct prices] so they will get picked up in searches [on eBay]."" 8. Join a direct selling company . Direct selling is one of the easiest ways to earn some extra cash, especially if you sell products you love. Avon, for example, allows you start your own business for $10 -- your take home depends on your efforts. Some full-time representatives earn six-figure salaries, others own licensed Avon Beauty Centers and many just sell Avon part time around their family's schedules. Haizel MacIntyre started her Avon business in June of 2008 to earn supplemental income to her full-time job when her husband was laid off. Since joining Avon, MacIntyre averages $1,800 a month in sales and her husband is helping her run the business. Her Avon earnings help pay the bills, provide extras for her three kids and she is hoping to earn enough to put towards her college tuition when she goes back to school to get her Masters in Social Work. 9. Be a secret shopper . Keen eyes for detail as well as a good memory are really all that it takes to succeed as a secret shopper, says Zippy Sandler, who has been mystery shopping for about 13 years. After registering with a secret shopping company, you are paid to basically go undercover and report on a company's operation from the customer point of view. Sandler decided to start secret shopping not only to earn money eating, traveling and shopping, but also to learn customer service skills to pass along to the employees she managed at a retail store. Depending on the clients she is shopping for, Sandler says she has earned everywhere from $100 to $2,000 per month. 10. Sell your photos to stock agencies . It doesn't matter if you're a hobbyist, an amateur or a seasoned photographer - anyone can submit their photos to stock photo agencies like Shutterstock.com. If your images are accepted, they will be available for download by subscribers. Each time someone downloads your photos, you get 25 cents. Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

"Mitt Romney says he's not running for president again. Mind's made up. No chance of changing it. Well, except for his ""Dumb and Dumber"" scenario. Romney's reference to the Jim Carrey movie came up as he explained again on the Hugh Hewitt radio show Tuesday night all the reasons he's sitting out the 2016 presidential race. Romney said, ""someone else stands a better chance of winning than I do. Had that not been the case, had I believed I would actually be best positioned to beat Hillary Clinton, then I would be running."" Despite the calls from some Republicans for the 2012 nominee to take another shot in 2016, Romney again said, ""I actually believe that someone new, someone not defined yet, someone who perhaps is from the next generation, will be able to catch fire potentially, build a movement and be able to beat Hillary Clinton. ""If I thought that weren't the case,"" he added, ""then I would be running."" But Hewitt pressed him, saying that had to be subject to change if circumstances became different. ""I'm not going there,"" Romney responded, laughing. ""This is something we gave a lot of thought to when I decided early on we're not going to run this time. I had the chance of running. I didn't win."" Then he added, ""circumstances can change, but I'm just not going to let my head go there. I remember that great line from ""Dumb and Dumber..."" As Hewitt said the line (""so you're telling me there's a chance""), Romney said, ""there you go. You remember. So you're telling me I have a chance. Yes, one out of a million."" Romney then painted a scenario about as likely as Carrey's Lloyd Christmas winning over Lauren Holly. ""Well, let's say all the guys that were running all came together and said, 'hey, we decided we can't do it,'"" he said. ""You must do it. That's the one of a million we're thinking about."" Which allows the political media to say, so you're telling us there's a chance... Opinion: Will Mitt Romney run for president in 2016?

"Apple released its latest mobile operating system update on Monday, iOS 7.1. The major upgrade packs in an assortment of bug fixes, improvements, new features and some subtle changes to the overall interface. iOS 7.1 is the first major update to the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch operating system since iOS 7 was released in September 2013. There are some welcome repairs in 7.1. The update improves the accuracy of the fingerprint sensor on iPhone 5S devices, which occasionally had issues recognizing fingerprints. Apple says there are general performance improvements for iPhone 4 owners, many of whom complained of speed and other issues after upgrading to iOS 7.0. It also repairs a bug that caused the home screen to crash. Minor upgrades include an additional way to activate Siri. You can now hold down the Home button and start speaking, letting go when you're done bossing it around. Without the upgrade, you must wait for Siri to detect when you are done speaking. Male and female Siri voices have been updated to sound more natural in Mandarin, Japanese and UK and Australian English. iPhone photographers won't have to manually toggle on HDR. The camera on the iPhone 5S will now automatically detect scenes it thinks can benefit from high-dynamic range and turn it on. iTunes Radio, the Calendar App and FaceTime have all added minor improvements, and there are a handful of accessibility tweaks aimed at making the OS work better for the visually impaired. The big new feature in 7.1 is CarPlay, a tool for pairing an iPhone 5 and newer smartphones with select in-car systems. Apple announced details about CarPlay last week. It lets drivers control features like navigation, the phone, music and messages using Siri voice control, an in-car touchscreen display, and the usual buttons and knobs built into cars. Don't get too excited about taking CarPlay for a spin just yet. The feature is part of a new partnership with big-name car companies, including Volvo, Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz, and will only be available for a small number of new vehicles for now. To get the free update on your mobile Apple device, make sure you're connected to a Wi-Fi network (it's too big to download over your cellular connection), go to Settings -> General -> Software Update and tap Download and Install. It can also be downloaded through iTunes. You can find a full list of the changes on Apple's support site.","Apple releases the iOS 7.1 update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch .

"Mortar fire hammered a college in Syria's capital, the government and rebels said, killing at least 10 people. Shells hit the  Architecture College at the University of Damascus. State media earlier said 15 people were killed but eventually changed the toll to 10 dead in mortar fire by ""terrorists"" -- the name the government uses to describe anti-government groups. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said a shell struck the cafeteria of the architectural engineering faculty. Mohammad Amer al-Mardini, the university rector, is quoted by SANA as saying that along with the 10 dead, 29 were wounded. ""No one, in any position in the world, can imagine there is an act more criminal than this one,"" al-Mardini is quoted as saying. ""If the aim behind this criminal act was to close the University of Damascus, with its history and deep-rootedness, then we stress that it won't shut down in defiance of the enemies."" The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 10 civilians were killed by mortar shells at the architecture college and that the number of dead was likely to rise. It said several shells fell inside the campus. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said 12 people died in the incident. They were among at least 107 killed in warfare across the nation Thursday, the group said. The crisis in Syria began two years ago when the government of Bashar al-Assad cracked down on peaceful protesters. That clampdown morphed into a full-blown civil war. More than 70,000 people are believed to have been killed, the United Nations estimates. The warfare has spawned a vast humanitarian and displacement crisis. Time for a no-fly zone? International diplomacy has failed to forge peace as the warring rages daily. Syrian rebels have been obtaining weapons from entities outside the country and have seized arms from the well-stocked military.  But Western nations have been reluctant to arm factions opposing the Assad government. One official who helped a failed effort to bring about a cease-fire in Syria says it's time for a bit of a change. Norwegian Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, former head of the U.N. monitoring team in Syria, told the BBC on Wednesday that it's time for the world to consider imposing a no-fly zone, an area over which aircraft are not allowed to fly. Al-Assad's government regularly has used its aircraft to attack rebel positions. ""To level the playing field now in the military terms would be to consider no-fly zones, to consider whether the Patriots in Turkey could have a role also in taking on some responsibility for the northern part of Syria,"" he said. Patriots, which are surface-to-air missiles, have been deployed to Turkey to protect the country. The U.N. Security Council imposed a no-fly zone in Libya in 2011 to halt the violence by the Moammar Gadhafi government. That effort helped rebels there topple Gadhafi. No-fly zones were also imposed  by Western nations in Iraq during the rule of Saddam Hussein. A no-fly zone would help an interim government take hold in territory that rebels have seized from the Syrian military. The opposition has chosen Ghassan Hitto, a Syrian-American, to be the prime minister of that government. Mood said a no-fly zone should be accompanied by planning for a transition. ""The next thing to argue is incredibly important. It is useless to discuss or to consider a no-fly zone unless you are thinking beyond it, unless you are already then starting to plan."" If the government should quickly collapse, he asks, ""what next then?"" He also says the world must look at how international diplomacy can be used to ""achieve results with military means that strengthen the moderates inside Syria."" The world must also think about reconstruction after the war is ended and getting humanitarian aid ""to the women and children and the suffering Syrian population.""","The death toll now stands at 10, the government and an opposition group say .

"Secretary of State John Kerry's call to Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein last Friday surfaced administration tensions over the torture report detailing Bush-era CIA interrogation tactics. Behind the scenes, the CIA and State Department had been fighting to not publish the report, while the Justice Department and the White House had been pushing for the opposite in hopes of getting it done and over with. While all Obama administration officials agree the intelligence assessment that the report's publication could arouse protests on the Arab streets, some officials said further delay doesn't do anything to prevent that from happening. Additionally, the government was fighting a losing battle on withholding the report within the court system. Judges have taken a dim view of the need of the CIA to completely block the release of documents on this program, and the administration's determination was that the agency is better off with a controlled release of documents, which began Tuesday morning with the disclosure of only the 480 page executive summary, plus a shorter Republican counter-assessment and the CIA's own assessment. According to State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, Kerry -- who served alongside Feinstein in the Senate for decades -- was simply reiterating concerns about the safety of Americans following the report's release, not backing away from the administration's support for doing so. ""He wanted to have a discussion with a former colleague ... about foreign and policy implications of the release of the report, ongoing efforts -- everything from our ongoing efforts related to ISIL, the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world,"" Psaki said Monday during her daily briefing. ""He was simply raising the fact that these are issues that are ongoing right now, and certainly, he wanted to have a discussion and make sure that they were factored into the timing,"" she added. A Democratic Senate aide, speaking on background, told CNN none of the concerns Kerry conveyed in the phone call to Feinstein were new or unknown. ""Certainly if Secretary Kerry was citing instability and chaos across the world and in the Middle East, there's no argument on that, but that's not going to change any time soon,"" the aide said. ""The horrible acts against Americans, whether committed by ISIL or AQAP or whoever, will continue. And while they may cite the release of the report, they're already doing everything they can to hurt Americans."" The aide pointed out the report has been gone over with a fine-toothed comb by the Obama administration so as to ensure ""the report does not compromise our intelligence sources and methods or compromise our national security."" ""We've been preparing our foreign partners for any possible response,"" the aide said. ""And there have been efforts going on for multiple days to prepare stations and embassies and bases for any response, just as there is any time the United States takes an action that might provoke a response."" According to an administration official, 93% of the report is unredacted. ""There's going to be nothing lost in this narrative,"" the official added. When asked about the phone call Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to offer up how much the White House knew ahead of time. ""The President and the secretary share the view that the release of the report is important for that purpose,"" he said during his daily briefing. ""I will allow Secretary Kerry to explain exactly why he made the phone call."" Former Vice President Dick Cheney pushed back on the report Monday night. It portrays the CIA as misleading the Bush White House and Justice Department, among others. ""What I keep hearing out there is they portray this as a rogue operation and the agency was way out of bounds and then they lied about it,"" he said in a telephone interview with The New York Times. ""I think that's all a bunch of hooey. The program was authorized. The agency did not want to proceed without authorization, and it was also reviewed legally by the Justice Department before they undertook the program.""","Secretary of State John Kerry's call to Sen.

"The first significant new museum of American art in nearly half a century debuted in 2011. But to view Crystal Bridges' collection—from a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington to Jackson Pollock canvases—you don't travel to New York, Los Angeles or Chicago. You head down a forested ravine in a town in northwestern Arkansas. As museum founder and Walmart heiress Alice Walton scooped up tens of millions of dollars' worth of art from across the country, thinly veiled snobbish rhetoric began to trickle out from the coasts. Most notably, when she purchased Asher B. Durand's 1849 Kindred Spirits from the New York Public Library for $35 million, some culturati bristled at the thought that this famed Hudson River School landscape would be leaving for Bentonville. The controversy raised the question: Who deserves access to great art? Yet a small town is precisely the kind of place where a stellar art collection fits in. After all, coastal hamlets, mountaintop villages and desert whistle-stops have inspired American artists for generations, among them, the Impressionists of Connecticut's Old Lyme Colony and the minimalist installation artists who more recently gentrified Marfa. Where else can you find the mix of affordable rents, access to inspiring natural vistas and enough peace and quiet to actually get work done? Many small towns also offer detour-worthy museums, some housed in spectacular historic spaces—old factories, former army bases, Beaux-Arts estates, Victorian mansions—and others built from scratch by internationally renowned architects like Zaha Hadid and Swiss firm Herzog & de Meuron. And with works inside just as varied, from landscape paintings at the Taos Art Museum to minimalist installations at Dia:Beacon to American folk art at the Shelburne, you're sure to find a small-town art museum to suit any artistic taste. Travel+Leisure: America's best ice cream shops . Hill-Stead Museum, Farmington, Connecticut . When iron industrialist Alfred A. Pope began buying French Impressionist masterpieces, the movement was still stirring outrage across Europe for its radical departure from tradition. But you'd never know it from the intimate, even cozy, atmosphere at the Hill-Stead Museum, which places these works in the same context in which Pope would have enjoyed them—surrounded by antiques and period Federal-, Chippendale- and Empire-style furnishings in his hilltop estate outside of Hartford. Like the works you'll find inside, by Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Mary Cassatt and Édouard Manet, the house itself now seems lovely and genteel. But it also comes with a radical back story: the Colonial Revival mansion, completed in 1901, was designed by Pope's own daughter, only the fourth registered female architect in American history. $15; hillstead.org. Ohr-O'Keefe Museum, Biloxi, Mississippi . Biloxi's Ohr-O'Keefe Museum raises many questions. You might wonder what an avant-garde museum is doing in a Gulf Coast beach town known for its casinos and sunshine. Or how starchitect Frank Gehry got involved in a project dedicated to obscure 19th-century ceramicist George Ohr. Or how this place is even still standing. During construction, Hurricane Katrina slammed an unmoored casino barge directly into the unfinished buildings. Any lack of logic seems appropriate in honoring Ohr, a true eccentric who dubbed himself the Mad Potter of Biloxi and was known for his delightfully misshapen, brightly colored pottery. Opened in 2010 in a thicket of live oaks, the museum encompasses brick-and-steel pavilions, twisted egg-shaped pods and examples of 19th-century vernacular architecture, with galleries on African American art, ceramics and Gulf Coast history. $10; georgeohr.org. The Huntington, San Marino, California . San Marino is named for the tiny republic on the Italian peninsula. And it's an appropriate connection for the Huntington, where the vibe is distinctly European, thanks to 120 manicured acres (reserve ahead for the Tea Room, surrounded by a rose garden) and a collection skewed to Old World classics. The Huntington Art Gallery has the largest collection of 18th- and 19th-century British art outside of London—including works by Thomas Gainsborough and John Constable. Other galleries within this Beaux-Arts estate cover Renaissance paintings and 18th-century sculpture as well as the furniture of Frank Lloyd Wright and paintings by Mary Cassatt and Edward Hopper. A Gutenberg Bible from the 1450s and an illuminated manuscript of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales are among the library's gems. $20. Travel+Leisure: The best apps and websites for travelers . Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, East Lansing, Michigan . College towns offer more than beautiful campuses, tradition-rich bars and football. Many can also brag about world-class art collections. Case in point: Michigan State University's new Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum. It's the first-ever university building designed by Pritzker Prize--winner Zaha Hadid and only her second project in North America. The corrugated stainless steel and glass facade juts sharply like a ship—or perhaps more accurately a spaceship—run aground. While the collection is primarily contemporary, the curators included some classic works to better contextualize the newer acquisitions. So you can expect Old Master paintings, 19th-century American paintings and 20th-century sculpture, along with artifacts from ancient Greece, Rome and the pre-Columbian Americas. Free; broadmuseum.msu.edu. Parrish Art Museum, Water Mill, New York . Low-slung and shedlike, with its corrugated tin roof and parallel 615-foot slabs of poured concrete, Eastern Long Island's newest art museum features a style that might be called Modern Agricultural. Surrounded by a meadow of tall grasses on the long road to Montauk, the museum is a minimalist stunner that's perfectly suited to its surroundings: The long horizontal space speaks both to the uninterrupted horizons of the region's famed beaches and to the unfussy simplicity that first attracted artists like Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner and Willem de Kooning. Inside, under an ever-changing glow from skylights above, the collection honors the generations of artists who called this area home, such as American Impressionist William Merritt Chase and mid-century realist Fairfield Porter. In 2014, it won Swiss firm Herzog & de Meuron a T+L Design Award for best museum. $10; parrishart.org. Shelburne Museum, Shelburne, Vermont . Most art collectors limit purchases to what they can hang on the walls or set on their mantelpieces. But sugar heiress Electra Havemeyer Webb had grander plans. After amassing Hudson River School landscapes, quirky folk art, quilts, decoys, toys and circus posters, Webb decided she needed somewhere to put it all. So she set out doing what she did best: collecting. From across New England and New York, Webb gathered 18th- and 19th-century structures—houses, barns, a schoolhouse, a jail, a general store, a lighthouse and a steamboat—and set them up on 45 acres of farmland near Lake Champlain, where she founded the Shelburne Museum in 1947. More than 150,000 pieces are on display and more accessible than ever; The 2013 opening of the Pizzagalli Center for Art and Education allowed the formerly seasonal Shelburne to stay open year-round. $22. Chinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas . The Chinati Foundation is massive by design. Fed up with the cramped galleries of New York City and the need to constantly rotate exhibits, minimalist sculptor Donald Judd decamped to this tiny former railroad stop in the Chihuahuan Desert in 1971. Nearly 200 miles from an airport and surrounded on all sides by scrub grasslands, Marfa is blessed, above all else, with space. Judd teamed with the Dia Foundation to transform a decommissioned army base into the 340-acre arts compound. Here and in a number of buildings downtown, works are given room to breathe. A hundred of Judd's trademark aluminum boxes fill two old brick artillery sheds; Dan Flavin's light installations occupy six barracks; Richard Long's volcanic stone pieces sit on an old tennis court; and John Chamberlain's painted steel sculptures are in the Marfa Wool and Mohair Building. $25, full collection tour.

Opened in June 2013 in the waterfront town of Bainbridge Island, BIMA is just a five-minute walk from the ferry terminal that brings passengers across Puget Sound from Seattle. But BIMA's curators aren't concerned with any big-city competition. They've honed in with a laser-like focus on contemporary fine arts and crafts from a very small radius: the Kitsap and Olympic peninsulas and the Western Puget Sound region. It's all on view in a dazzling glass building that reflects the region's eco-friendly spirit. With its rooftop garden, recycled-denim insulation, solar panels, geothermal wells and sustainable tigerwood siding, BIMA is on track to become the first LEED Gold--certified museum in the state—and among the first in the nation. Free; biartmuseum.org. Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas . Casting her curatorial net (and considerable wealth) far and wide, Alice Walton gathered centuries of exceptional American art, from the Colonial era up to the present. The works by Gilbert Stuart, John Singer Sargent, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock, to name just a few, would make any big city proud. But Walton set her project in a place critically underserved by cultural institutions, the Ozarks town of Bentonville, where Sam Walton opened his first five and dime. Designed by Israeli-American architect Moshe Safdie with an eye toward connecting with the landscape, the museum is made up of eight interconnected galleries built in and around spring-fed pools, surrounded by forests, ravines and miles of hiking trails. It helped inspire the opening of 21c, a nearby art-filled boutique hotel with a locavore restaurant. Free; crystalbridges.org. Mass MoCA, North Adams, Massachusetts . The repurposed 19th-century brick buildings that make up Mass MoCA's 13-acre campus are forever linked with northwestern Massachusetts' industrial heritage. These buildings housed textile manufacturers, then Sprague Electric Company, which produced parts for the atomic bomb and the Gemini spacecraft. When Sprague left in 1985, the site was historically significant but unwieldy—a superfund contamination site also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The director of the Williams College Museum of Art came looking for a raw space for larger-than-life installations. After more than a decade of renovations, Mass MoCA opened in 1999. Now artist residencies mean that works of art—visual, music, dance, film, theater—are being created on the very same floors where forward-thinking advances have been developed for 150 years. $15.

"A man known as ""Carlos the Jackal"" stood trial in Paris on Monday, accused of fatal bombings in France during the 1980s. The 62-year-old, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, was once among the world's most wanted fugitives. He is on trial for his alleged role in the attacks on two trains, a train station and a newspaper office in France in 1982 and 1983. The bombings killed 11 and injured more than 100. The Venezuelan-born revolutionary has been serving a life sentence in France since 1997, when he was convicted for the shooting deaths of two French secret agents and an informant in 1975. Ramirez, who was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, first made headlines in 1975 when he led an attack on an OPEC meeting in Vienna that took at least 60 hostage, including 11 oil ministers. He was nicknamed ""Carlos the Jackal"" by the press, a reference to the principal character and assassin in Frederick Forsyth's novel ""The Day of the Jackal."" After two decades on the run, Ramirez was captured in 1994 in Sudan and taken to Paris in a sack. Entering court dressed casually in jeans and a navy jacket Monday, Ramirez smiled when asked to identify his profession.  ""I am a professional revolutionary,"" he replied. Ramirez regularly raised his fist in the air to those sitting in the back of the courtroom who had come to support him. Francis Szpiner, lawyer for some civil parties in the case, said he was not put off by Ramirez's theatrics. ""I am concerned that 17 years later, we can see that he hasn't learned or forgotten a thing.  He has not changed a bit, so I expect a difficult trial and the victims will simply have to listen to him with patience and perseverance,"" Szpiner said. Ramirez's lawyer and wife, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre told reporters outside the courtroom that her client was in a ""fighting mood"" and that she was ready to prove his innocence. ""Let's be concrete. Ilich Ramirez Sanchez is not implicated by any evidence,"" she said, adding that ""a lie is being prepared for these victims who in turn will never know who was behind the attacks.""

"The so-called war on women that Democrats love to talk about on the campaign trail may be losing some of its luster. The attack line -- aimed at painting Republicans as out of sync with women on contraception, abortion and other issues -- isn't resonating like in 2012, when Democrats hurled it at the GOP with a devastating effect. Instead, Republicans have improved their standing among women during this election cycle, narrowing the gender gap in key races that could decide control of the Senate. The dynamic reflects the painstaking efforts among Republicans to avoid the mistakes of 2012. This time around, there aren't any candidates talking about ""legitimate rape"" or ""binders full of women."" And the GOP put up strong female candidates in states like Iowa and Michigan, making it harder for Democrats to attack them as opposed to the interests of women. The strategy seems to be paying off. ""The gender gap is smaller when Republicans don't make mistakes,"" said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University. ""Republicans this time have managed to neutralize their deficiencies in this area so the war on women rhetoric does not resonate so much."" Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said Republicans are riding a ""perfect storm"" in Senate races in red states as they enjoy the knock-on effect of national factors like Ebola and ISIS, which have overshadowed social issues. ""They have learned their lessons from 2012,"" she said. Still, Democrats aren't toning down the rhetoric. An attack ad by Democratic Sen. Mark Udall warns that the only place his opponent Cory Gardner will take Colorado women is backwards, and accused him of waging an ""eight year crusade that would ban birth control."" Another Udall spot features a female gynecologist and obstetrician complaining that Gardner sponsored harsh anti-abortion laws. The barrage has prompted Republicans backing Gardner to brand Udall ""Senator Uterus"" — a phrase that was even picked up by a moderator in a Colorado Senate debate this month. Despite the attacks, polls show abortion and contraception are not decisive issues in their tight race — reflecting data that shows the core Democratic constituency of young unmarried women often tune out the mid-terms. In a Quinnipiac University poll last week, women picked Udall by 45% to 41%. But men back Gardner by 51% to 38% giving the Republican a five point lead in the race overall. It's a similar story in Arkansas, where the incumbent Mark Pryor is tied or just behind among women with Republican Tom Cotton, but is down about 15 points or more among men. The Democrat launched a ""Women for Pryor"" tour through the state this month, and has put up YouTube videos slamming Cotton for ""insulting"" views on women. In June, a Pryor ad featured a woman identified as ""Courtney""who asked ""Who is this guy and what has he got against women?"" In Iowa, Republicans are savoring the strong showing of Joni Ernst, who leads Democrat Bruce Braley despite assaults on her position on abortion, which she opposes. Ernst, a Harley-Davidson riding Army veteran has built a tough political persona after turning around her campaign in an ad in which she spoke of castrating hogs on an Iowa farm. Recent polls reveal a ""reverse gender gap"" as the male candidate Braley leads the female Ernst among women but trails further behind among men. Ernst knew what was coming: ""soon we'll be hearing about the war on women,"" she predicted after winning her primary, and warned Democrats she knows what real war is like. Terri Lynn Land, a Republican Senate candidate in Michigan, also went on the offensive. ""As a woman, I might know a little bit more about women than Gary Peters,"" Land said in an ad, as she sat in a living room and sipped from a coffee cup. In Kentucky, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell showcased his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao as he parried claims by Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes that he is anti-women. In a new McConnell ad this week, young women hammer Grimes with the message: ""She thinks I will vote for the candidate who looks like me, rather than the one who represents me."" In the latest Bluegrass Poll for the Courier-Journal, McConnell is in a statistical tie with Grimes among women voters while maintaining a one point lead overall. Republicans have not closed the gender gap everywhere. And where they are struggling, the Democratic focus on women's economic issues may be the reason. WATCH: These nerds can elect anyone . In North Carolina, Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan slammed her Republican foe Thom Tillis for branding federal equal pay legislation a ""gimmick.""  Her lead among women was 11 percent in a margin-of-error race, according to a Survey USA poll last week. Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential contender, hit women's issues hard when she campaigned with Hagan in Charlotte on Saturday, beseeching an 1,800 strong crowd to reach out to ""every single woman."" ""Women's rights are the canary in the coal mine. If you don't protect women's rights here at home and around the world, everybody's rights are lost,"" Clinton said. In Georgia, Democrat Michelle Nunn highlighted workplace fairness to widen her attack on Republican David Perdue's business record.  A new CNN poll released . Friday put her lead among women voters at a gaping 18 percent. In each of these races, the rhetoric aimed at women is often more focused on pocketbook issues as opposed to the more hot-button subjects of abortion and contraception. Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said women voters may simply not be seeing enough from Democrats to get them out to vote. There's a paradox here. Obama's low approval ratings are dragging down vulnerable Democrats. But the fact he's not in the national spotlight drawing a clear choice on women's issues with an opponent like Romney is making it more difficult to crystallize the arguments. ""The bigger challenge that the Democrats are facing this time may or may not be about whether the Republicans are appealing more to women — but the Democrats are not inspiring or turning out the women,"" said Walsh. While Republicans may be doing better— it's too early to say that they are winning back what will be a decisive demographic in 2016. In the 2010 midterms. the gender gap was smaller than usual in many races but the party fell back again when the White House was on the ballot. Republican prospects may also suffer if Democrats nominate Clinton, a candidate with historic possibility even for some women who may otherwise balk at voting for Democrats. ""Her mere presence signifies the women's issue,"" said Lawless. And sometimes, Republican rhetoric towards women still seems a little dated. In a digital ad aimed at young women this month, the College National Republican Committee compared picking out a gubernatorial candidate to choosing a wedding gown. The Democratic Governors Association said that proved Republicans ""still have no idea how to communicate with women voters.""","Democratic rhetoric aimed at women isn't resonating as well as it did in 2012 .

"Editor's note: CNN does not offer medical advice. If you have a serious medical complaint please consult a physician. Long hours sitting in an airport or on a train. Jet lag. Miles of walking. Travel is tough on the body. About eight years ago I started battling pain whenever I traveled. The large muscles up and down my leg and hip would get hard and tight, making sitting, standing or even sleeping painful. Massages, Jacuzzi baths, ibuprofen and yoga alleviated the pain, but temporarily. While all were helpful, no remedy really provided the ""release"" I felt I needed to undo those tight spots. A physical therapist suggested pressure point therapy as a way to help the muscles relax. She used a device called a Thera Cane, a deep-pressure massage device that's shaped like a large candy cane, to press down hard on my tight spots and help them release. Voila! I experienced some relief. However, the bulky Thera Cane isn't really travel friendly. And it requires a second person to use. I wondered what might work while traveling, even alone? The ends of the Thera Cane are studded with hard, little plastic balls -- wandering through the aisles of a sporting goods store one day I stumbled across a possible solution: a Wiffle Ball! For those who aren't familiar with them, the Wiffle Ball (there are a number of imitators) is a perforated, rubbery-plastic ball about the size of a baseball. For kids, especially in the United States, they're used to play baseball in safe and confined areas. I bought a three-pack for about $1.50 and tried one out on my legs -- it worked great. Wiffle Balls are lightweight, durable and inexpensive -- the perfect accessory for on-the-road pressure point relief. Following the exercises my physical therapist showed me with the Thera Cane, I came up with five ""do anywhere"" moves for instant tension relief. 1. Foot relief . Sit in a chair or on the edge of a bed, place the Wiffle Ball under your foot (starting in the arch) and slowly roll your foot back and forth over the ball for about two minutes. The massage motion will increase blood flow and help release tightness in the arch. 2. Back rub . Lay on the floor (better than the bed, which is too soft) and place the ball under your shoulder blade. Slowly rock yourself back and forth over the ball, moving it around the large muscles encasing the blade. 3. Hip and upper leg tension reliever . Still on the floor on your back, move the ball under one side of your bottom -- place the ball right in the center of the largest part of the muscle and roll around on top of it, letting it move around the entire buttock and up toward your lower back then down to where the buttock meets the thigh. You should feel tension release down the hip and into the leg. 4. IT Band/outer leg reliever . Runners know the IT Band well -- it runs along the outside of the leg, down the thigh and over the outer part of the knee. Roll over onto one side, prop yourself up on an elbow and place the ball just below your hip in the large part of your thigh. Slowly move yourself up and down while bracing with your elbow, allowing the ball to roll up and down your leg to relieve tension. 5. Hip flexor release . Sitting for hours can make the muscles at the front of your hip and leg tighten. To release, roll over on your stomach and put the ball right in the spot where your leg meets the hip and lay flat for about a minute, rolling slightly until you find your tightest spots. You'll also access the psoas muscle this way -- the psoas is a rope-like muscle that runs obliquely from spine to the femur -- releasing additional tightness.

"(CNN) -- Of the many ghouls that we associate with Halloween, few reign as supremely in our imaginings as witches. Though these days, our fascination with witchcraft takes on a more benign form (nothing a Netflix all-night Buffy-fest can't cure), there once was a time when the mere mention of sorcery led entire towns to burn, drown, crush and flay those individuals believed in possession of magical powers.

Salem, Massachusetts . The Salem witch trials that ended in 1693 have become firmly embedded in the public imagination. Most notably, the trials were the basis for Arthur Miller's McCarthyism parable, ""The Crucible"", though since they've made the backdrop of fantasy staples, from ""Dr. Who"" to ""The Vampire Diaries."" The trials, which led to the execution of 20 ""witches,"" started after two girls were afflicted with a strange illness that 17th-century doctors could not diagnose. Over 150 individuals were ultimately accused, with several dying while languishing in jail cells. Today, Salem's witchlore has resulted in a booming tourist trade. Over 100,000 visitors pour into town during the month-long Haunted Happenings festival, which takes place every October. ""About 85% of visitors we asked say they're interested in the witch trials, and 80% say they're interested in modern witches,"" explains Kate Fox, the executive director of Destination Salem. The town also boasts a strong Wiccan community, with many setting up spell shops and psychic stalls where visitors can get their palms read. While witch costumes are encouraged, green face paint is not smiled upon. ""The witch community is not a fan of green-faced witches. It's a stereotype they're trying to get away from,"" Fox explains.

Religious fervor played a strong role, as the Protestant King James I was eager to rout out both witches and Catholics -- often associated as one and the same. The impoverished didn't fare much better. ""The poor often sold natural remedies from local plants and herbs, which local authorities often viewed as 'spells', and hence demonic,"" explains Michael Williams, tourism team leader for Pendle Borough Council and Marketing Lancashire. Last year marked the 400th anniversary of the trials, which the town commemorated by instituting the Pendle Sculpture Trail -- a signposted walk that has ten plaques -- one for each victim -- posted on trees throughout the woodland area. The trails are dotted with landmarks from the trials, and culminate at Lancaster Castle, the former prison where he accused were tried. Brocken, Germany . Fans of Faust might recognize the Brocken as the traditional meeting place of witches, who apparently gather yearly April 30 for Walpurgisnacht. The Brocken is the highest peak of the Harz mountain range in North Germany, and was once believe to be the destination for many a goat-riding witch or warlock (brooms came into the equation later). Though locals once hung crosses and herbs on their doors to ward off the supposedly evil-doers, these days celebrants emulate the witches. Thousands channel their inner Hermione and gather on the mountain top clad in black hats and makeup. Read more: World's weirdest food festivals . La Paz, Bolivia . In a mountain clearing known as Cerro Cumbre sits the type of market that doesn't carry your usual tourist fodder (unless you're in the market for a dried llama fetus). The Witches Market, or Mercado de las Brujas is made up of shops that carry everything from medicinal herbs, to heftier spell-making ingredients. For many of the brujas, or witches, magic is a family business, and several store owners sell concoctions that have been passed down through the generations. Though the market used to be the exclusive purview of Bolivians, these days, tourists make up the bulk of its economy. Catemaco, Mexico . Every year, on the first Friday of March, the town of Catemaco hosts the International Congress of Witches. Thousands of believers bus in from all over Mexico to enlist local sorcerers to cast a spell or read a fortune (for a fee). Though witchcraft has a centuries-old history in Mexico -- a mix of pre-Hispanic and Catholic rituals -- the Congress only dates back to the '70s. In recent years, the event has become a tourist attraction, and these days local music acts are as much a part of it as the palm readings and curse removals.","Salem attracts over 100,000 witch-hunting tourists around Halloween.

"The slaughter of dolphins has begun again in a small Japanese village, in a controversial annual hunt that pits Western environmentalist values against what locals say are traditional hunting practices. Taiji, a coastal town of 3,500 people in the Japanese prefecture of Wakayama, has a dolphin hunting season from September to March every year. Local fishermen are permitted by the Wakayama prefectural government to hunt an annual quota of nearly 2,000 dolphins and porpoises from seven different species, in accordance with what the government says is traditional practice. Most of the dolphins are killed for their meat, but many are sold live to aquariums around the world. 'Eerie' killing cove . In recent years, the Taiji dophin hunt has become a focal point for activists, particularly since the release of the Academy Award-winning 2009 film The Cove, which documented the hunt and raised awareness of Taiji's dolphin hunting industry internationally. Conservationist group Sea Shepherd has had a presence in Taiji during hunt season for the past five years, broadcasting tfrom the village via a livefeed, and mobilizing a social media campaign against the hunt. The campaign has drawn celebrity and other high-profile supporters, with comedian Ricky Gervais and U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy tweeting their support in recent years, and former Beverly Hills 90210 and Charmed actress Shannen Doherty visiting Taiji last week to witness the hunt. ""It's eerie,"" Doherty said in a statement. ""You wonder how they (the hunters) are able to go to bed at night... I think being here rocks even the most hardened human being, because it is just atrocious."" Melissa Sehgal, Sea Shepherd's campaign co-ordinator for the Taiji project, which it calls ""Operation Infinite Patience,"" said that after 15 days without the capture or killing of dolphins, the fishermen had begun killing pods of Risso's dolphins last week. Four dolphin pods had been driven into the cove for killing so far this year, the group said. ""These dolphins are a gentle and docile species, but they continued to fight and struggle to stay alive,"" Sehgal told CNN. Japan officials defend dolphin hunting at Taiji Cove . Locals defend practice . The Wakayama prefectural government declined CNN's request for an interview, referring instead to a statement on its website outlining its position on the issue. It said that residents viewed dolphins and whales as a legitimate marine resource, and that the hunt, a local tradition, was integral to the town's economic survival. ""Located far away from the centers of economic activity, the town has a 400-year history as the cradle of whaling, and has flourished over the years thanks to whaling and the dolphin fishery,"" the statement said. ""The dolphin fishery is still an indispensable industry for the local residents to make their living."" 'Barbaric' technique . Sea Shepherd is particularly opposed to the method used to herd and capture the dolphins, a technique known as ""drive hunting"" which Sehgal described as ""barbaric."" ""Using metal banger poles to create a wall of sound to disorient and deafen the pod... forces them to swim away from the boats and into the shallows of the killing cove,"" she said. ""Once netted into the cove, the dolphins are literally wrangled and tethered, often sustaining bloody wounds... The dolphin hunters use large metal rods to penetrate the spinal cord. This is hammered into the dolphins and small whales. The dolphins do not die immediately, but are left to either bleed out from internal injuries or drown in their own blood."" The Taiji fishermen's union has previously told CNN that the spine-severing technique had been introduced as a more humane method of killing the dolphins. Opinion: How hunters slaughter dolphins in Japan . Fishermen harassed? Sea Shepherd's operations in Taiji involve live-streaming activity in the village, including following suspected fishermen they believe to be transporting dolphin meat. A recent live-stream showed men retreating into garages when the Sea Shepherd crew approached. This activism from foreign conservationists is interpreted by some locals as harassment. ""The Taiji dolphin fishery has been a target of repeated psychological harassment and interference by aggressive foreign animal protection organizations,"" reads the Wakayama government's statement. ""Taiji dolphin fishermen are just conducting a legal fishing activity in their traditional way in full accordance with regulations and rules under the supervision of both the national and the prefectural governments. . . Such criticisms are an unfair threat to the fishermen's rights to make a living and offend the history and pride of the town."" The statement also likens the killing of the dolphins to the killing of cows and pigs for food, implying hypocrisy on the part of activists for their criticism of the dolphin hunt. ""Not only dolphins but also other animals including livestock such as cows and pigs display emotion and intelligence,"" it read. ""We, however, cannot help killing livestock to eat their meat. Do people criticize these activities as barbaric?"" 'Terrorized' dolphins . But activists say any comparison between the killing of wild dolphins and domesticated livestock is spurious. ""They're terrorized for hours on end,"" says Ric O'Barry, a former dolphin trainer who trained the animals used in the popular U.S. show Flipper, before undergoing a sea-change in his views about holding dolphins in captivity. He has campaigned against the live dolphin trade with his organization The Dolphin Project, and also featured in The Cove. ""They're self-aware like humans and the great apes. They look in the mirror and they know what they're looking at. They're not domesticated animals,"" he told CNN. Besides, he said, while many of the dolphins were killed and sold for meat, the most attractive specimens were rounded up during the drive hunting were taken alive and sold to aquariums for sums in excess of $100,000 an animal. These captures were the real ""economic underpinning"" of the annual hunt, he said. ""You'd get $400-500 for a dead dolphin's meat, but there's a lot of money for a live one, and that's what keeps this thing going,"" he said. Group: 250 dolphins await slaughter, lifetime of captivity at Japan's Taiji Cove . Live dolphin trade . Sehgal said that local dolphin trainers who ""claim to love dolphins"" were often seen assisting hunters in wrangling the animals to shore. ""Only the young, beautiful and more suitable are selected. These dolphins are then forced to witness their families brutally slaughtered in front of them,"" she said. According to Sea Shepherd estimates, 850 dolphins were killed and 160 taken into captivity last season, 920 killed and 249 caught the previous season, and 820 killed and 54 caught the season before that. Conservationists argue that it is this lucrative trade in captive dolphins that is the real motivation for the hunting season, a practice they say has only existed since the late 1960s. ""The argument that it is (an older) tradition is simply untrue,"" said Lisa Agabian, Sea Shepherd's director of media relations. ""Even if it were, I can say with absolute certainty that at no time would ancient fisherman have gone out with motorized fishing vessels and skiffs and modern technology to aid them in their capture of dolphins. The way they are hunting now, the dolphins don't have a fighting chance. That is certainly not traditional culture at work."" Said Sehgal: ""This is blood money . . . (there's) nothing cultural about kidnapping wild dolphins for profit."" But Japanese defenders of the hunt maintain that the hunting of dolphins and whales has been a traditional industry and economic lifeline since the 17th century. An official at the Taiji town office told CNN it was natural that hunting techniques had evolved with new technologies. Staff at Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Institute of Cetacean Research said they were not available for comment.","Four pods of Risso's dolphins have been killed in annual hunt in Taiji, Japan .

"U.S. drone strikes killed at least nine suspected members of al Qaeda in Yemen, where clashes intensified Tuesday between the terrorist group and Shia Houthi rebels, local security officials said. The three airstrikes in Yemen's Al Baitha province, near Radaa district, targeted al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula vehicles on their way to fight Houthis, the three security officials said. The air component came amid fighting on the ground in the province that, according to the officials, killed at least 36 fighters from both sides. Over the years, the Yemeni military, aided by American drone strikes, has failed to beat back AQAP. Yet the Houthis, a militant group that follows the Zaidi sect of Islam, have managed to defeat al Qaeda on numerous fronts, last week sweeping its militants from a stronghold in Al Baitha province. This push spurred AQAP to threaten to kill Houthi followers wherever they are spotted. More than 400 people have been killed from both sides over the past month in ongoing clashes in Al Baitha and Ibb provinces. While Houthis have been critical of U.S. drone strikes in the past, they have not objected to their use in the last month. The Houthis swept to power in Yemen after signing a ceasefire deal with the government in September, ending a political crisis that had halted life in Sanaa and left more than 300 dead in a month. Surge in fighting threatens Yemen's survival . Soldiers killed . Since 2012, Houthis have exploited Yemen's political vacuum to assert their own regional pull over the country's highlands while expanding their political traction by establishing Ansar Allah, their new political group. On Saturday, the Interior Ministry confirmed that al Qaeda attacked a government military facility and killed 19 soldiers in the port province of Hodeida. One day later, Houthis sent dozens of fighters there and forced al Qaeda to retreat. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for eight attacks against Houthis across Yemen in the past three weeks through its official Twitter account. Al Qaeda resurgent in Yemen amid political turmoil . Guerrilla tactics . After taking control of Sanaa, hundreds of Houthi fighters created checkpoints inside and surrounding the Yemeni capital. They have also expanded their reach into most northern Yemeni provinces. But Houthis are finding it more difficult to crush al Qaeda in Al Baitha, considered one of the network's main strongholds in central Yemen. ""Houthis are used to military clashes, while al Qaeda uses guerrilla tactics against its enemies. They hit and run unexpectedly,"" said AbdulSalam Mohammed, president of the Sanaa-based Abaad Strategic Center. ""Rules of war are different when fighting al Qaeda,"" he said. The Houthis have long complained that they have been marginalized and persecuted by Yemen's Sunni majority, and have been involved in a series of rebellions since 2004, justifying their actions by claiming self-defense. They are organized under the leadership of Abdel Malek al Houthi. Adding to an increasingly volatile situation, a secessionist movement in the south of Yemen, al Hirak, has stepped up protests in Aden, Yemen's chief port and the largest city in the south.","Yemeni officials: U.S. drone strikes kill at least nine suspected al Qaeda militants .

"Thomas Eric Duncan, the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States, is now in critical condition, a Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital spokeswoman said Saturday. The Liberian man had previously been listed as being in serious condition. Hospital spokeswoman Candace White offered no new details other than his condition. Earlier, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Duncan was in intensive care. About 10 people are at ""higher risk"" of catching Ebola after coming into contact with Duncan but have shown no symptoms, health officials said Saturday. The group is among 50 people being monitored daily, but the other 40 are considered ""low risk,"" said Dr. David Lakey, the commissioner of Texas department of state health services. The nine people who had definite contact with the Ebola patient -- including family members and health care professionals -- have been monitored and show no symptoms or fevers, Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Saturday. ""We have already gotten well over 100 inquiries of possible patients,"" Frieden told reporters. ""We've assessed every one of those ... and just this one patient has tested positive ... We expect that we will see more rumors or concerns or possibilities of cases, until there is a positive laboratory test, that is what they are."" Health officials did not provide details on the location of those being monitored or where they interacted with Duncan. Monitoring includes a visit from a public health expert and temperature checks twice a day. None of them has had symptoms of Ebola so far, according to Lakey. The latest figure is a drastic reduction of a number that started at 100 after initial talks with Duncan and hospital officials. Duncan landed in Dallas on September 20, and started feeling sick days later. He made his initial visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25. He was released with antibiotics but went back three days later and was quickly isolated. A blood test Tuesday confirmed he had Ebola, the first case of the deadly virus diagnosed on American soil. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? Relocated to undisclosed location . ""We've been very busy the last 24 hours trying to make sure that everyone who has had potential exposure is identified and they have been evaluated,"" Lakey said. The high-risk list likely includes Duncan's partner, Louise, her 13-year-old son and her two 20-something nephews. The four had been holed up in the apartment Duncan lived in before he was hospitalized. They were relocated to an undisclosed place Friday, and will be required to stay there until October 19. The incubation period -- time between Ebola infection and the onset of symptoms -- ranges between two to 21 days. The Dallas hospital where Duncan is being treated has come under fire for its handling of his first visit there eight days ago. Louise, who does not want her last name used, said Duncan told hospital staff he had a fever and abdominal pain, and had recently arrived from Liberia -- key information that could have been a tipoff for Ebola. Health care workers around the nation ""have to learn from the experience,"" Lakey said Saturday. ""The travel history is very important to take and it has to be communicated,"" he said. The hospital defended its handling of the case. ""As a standard part of the nursing process, the patient's travel history was documented and available to the full care team in the electronic health record, including within the physician's workflow,"" it said in a statement. Your Ebola questions answered . Plans to get married . The church Louise attends said Duncan came to the United States so the two could get married. Louise told the church's senior pastor, George Mason, about their marriage plan, according to Mark Wingfield, a spokesman at the Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas. How the Ebola virus spreads . Other Ebola scares . As nervous Dallas residents watch Duncan's case unfold, more Ebola scares popped up in other parts of the nation. Howard University Hospital in Washington said Friday it had admitted a low-risk patient with symptoms that could be associated with Ebola, but health officials on Saturday said Ebola had been ruled out in that case. The unnamed patient had recently traveled to Nigeria. In Liberia, NBC News freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpo was diagnosed with Ebola on Thursday, and is expected to leave Monrovia for the United States on Sunday aboard a private charter plane. In addition to Guinea and Sierra Leone, Liberia is one of three nations battling the deadly virus that has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa.

"America's drug war in Afghanistan is failing badly, a U.S. government watchdog says in a new report. Afghan farmers are growing bumper crops of opium poppies -- an unprecedented 209,000 hectares in 2013 -- even though U.S. agencies spent $7.6 billion to stop narcotics production in the nation. Afghanistan is the source of 80% of the world's illegal opium, the U.S. government says, yielding $3 billion in sales in 2013, up from $2 billion from the previous year. U.S. authorities say a big chunk of that money funds Afghanistan's insurgency and terrorism. As NATO winds down its war effort in the nation, the trend would appear to bode ill. Since 2002, the chief factors that appear to have caused temporary drops in poppy production were crop disease and high prices for wheat, an alternative crop for farmers, according to the report by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. ""The recent record-high level of poppy cultivation calls into question the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of those prior efforts,"" the report says. ""Given the severity of the opium problem and its potential to undermine U.S. objectives in Afghanistan, I strongly suggest that your departments consider the trends in opium cultivation and the effectiveness of past counternarcotics efforts when planning future initiatives."" The report says last year's 209,000-hectare record surpasses the previous high of 193,000 hectares of opium poppies grown in 2007. The report relies on figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs on Crime. The report says that areas that were once models for successful counterinsurgency and counternarcotics efforts are now booming poppy producers. The report cites Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan, which the United Nations declared ""poppy-free"" in 2008 but saw a fourfold increase in opium poppy production between 2012 and 2013. The inspector general sent the report to the State, Defense and Justice departments, which fund anti-drug efforts in Afghanistan. The State Department called the findings ""disappointing"" and blamed the increase in opium poppy production on shifts in the Afghan government's own security efforts. The Pentagon asked the inspector general to remove Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel from receiving the report because the military plays a secondary role to other U.S. government agencies in thwarting drug production in Afghanistan. ""In our opinion, the failure to reduce poppy cultivation and increase eradication is due to the lack of Afghan government support for the effort,"" Michael Lumpkin, assistant secretary of defense, wrote to the inspector general. ""Poverty, corruption, the terrorism nexus to the narcotics trade, and access to alternative livelihood opportunities that provide an equal or greater profit than poppy cultivation are all contributors to the Afghan drug problem.""","It says Afghan farmers are growing bumper crops of opium poppies .

"Becoming world champions for the fourth time, defeating the illustrious Brazil 7-1 in their own back yard along the way before returning to the adulation of a million people at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin -- 2014 has been just about the perfect year for Germany's football stars. But things didn't quite go to plan on Saturday as Joachim Low's side was defeated 2-0 by a well organized Poland in Euro 2016 qualifying. The result marks the first time Poland has ever defeated Germany -- a fact not lost on the raucous home crowd who seemed to expend as much energy singing and shouting over the course of this pulsating Group D match as their heroes did on the pitch. After a goalless first half, Arkadiusz Milik gave the Poles the lead in the 50th minute, rising to nod beyond Germany goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer. Poland's star-striker Robert Lewandoski then showed great strength to hold-off former Borussia Dortmund teammate Erik Durm late on before squaring to substitute Sebastian Mila who arrowed a fine strike beyond Neuer to make sure of the win. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny saved well from German sharp-shooters Andre Schurle and Mario Gotze in the moments after Poland took the lead while Lukas Podolski crashed a left-footed off the crossbar from eight yards out with 10 minutes remaining. Despite having much of the possession, Germany struggled to break down their hosts who were happy to sit deep and play on the counter-attack. ""Obviously, we're disappointed.""  Low said in quotes carried by the German FA's website after the match. ""I can't blame my team for much, maybe only that we were too careless with our chances. Poland then made it 1-0 with their very first shot."" Low's frustration was echoed by Neuer who admitted to being caught out for Poland's first strike. ""It was an avoidable defeat,"" Neuer said. ""We didn't play badly. If we had scored the first goal, then we would have won."" ""I came out bravely for the first goal, but I was too late -- it was a mistake by me."" Qualification for Euro 2016 in a group that also features Scotland, the Republic of Ireland and Georgia now seems wide open, although the World Champions will still be favorites to qualify. In Saturday's other Group D fixtures, Robbie Keane scored a hat-trick in the first 18 minutes of the Republic of Ireland's 7-0 romp against tournament debutants Gibraltar. Scotland overcame Georgia 1-0 in Glasgow, meanwhile, thanks to an own goal from Akaki Khubutia who turned into his own net after a vicious shot from Shaun Maloney. Poland now top the group with six points, ahead of Ireland on goal difference. Germany and Scotland lie three points back in third and fourth position respectively. The Poles have the chance to stretch their lead when they welcome Scotland on Wednesday while Germany will aim to get back on track by defeating the Irish in Gelsenkirchen. Northern Ireland wins, Greeks and Danes draw . Elsewhere in Euro 2016 qualifying Saturday, Northern Ireland rose to the top of Group F thanks to a 2-0 home victory over minnows the Faroe Islands. In the group's other matches, Finland held Greece 1-1 in Helsinki while a stunning free-kick from Balasz Dzsudzsak earned Hungary a 1-1 draw with Romania in Bucharest. A late goal from substitute Lasse Vibe spared Denmark's blushes against Albania and ensured the Danes remain top of Group I. Armenia held Serbia 1-1 in Hrazdan in Group I's earlier fixture.","Poland defeat Germany in Euro 2016 qualification match-up .

"The National Security Agency program that collects data on nearly every U.S. phone call isn't legal, a privacy review board said Thursday in a newly released report. Moreover, the five-member Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board said it's been largely useless in thwarting terrorism. ""We have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation,"" the board wrote in the report released Thursday. Despite Obama's NSA changes, phone records still collected . The board said it had identified only one instance in which the program helped authorities identify a terrorist in the last seven years. But the board said law enforcement would have found the suspect anyway, even without the NSA program. The board doesn't have any legal teeth, so its recommendations won't change government practices the way a court ruling might. But the findings are a stinging rebuke of President Barack Obama's legal defense of the program, in which the NSA tracks millions of telephone calls each day, harvesting the telephone numbers involved, the time calls are placed and how long they last. The recommendations of the board add to the growing chorus calling for an end to the government's dragnet collection of Americans' phone records, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""The report reaffirms the conclusion of many that the Section 215 bulk phone records program has not been critical to our national security, is not worth the intrusion on Americans' privacy, and should be shut down immediately,"" Leahy said in a statement. ""The report appropriately calls into question the legality and constitutionality of the program, and underscores the need to change the law to rein in the government's overbroad interpretation of Section 215."" A majority of the board -- formed as part of the federal government's response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks -- agreed with critics of the NSA that the program raises constitutional concerns. ""The Board concludes that Section 215 does not provide an adequate legal basis to support the program,"" it wrote its report. CNN reviewed a copy of the report. The board said the law authorizes the FBI to collect records related to a specific investigation, but not bulk collection of data that ""cannot be regarded as 'relevant' to any FBI investigation."" What Obama changed at the NSA: 5 takeaways . The law also ""does not authorize the NSA to collect anything,"" the board said. Last week, after a report by an outside review group appointed by Obama, the President announced changes to the program. Among other things, the NSA must now ask a judge each time an analyst wants to look at the data, and the agency will eventually lose its role as custodian of the information. But Obama said he felt it important to keep the program intact. ""The review group turned up no indication that this database has been intentionally abused,"" he said. ""And I believe it is important that the capability that this program is designed to meet is preserved."" One privacy advocate called the changes ""window dressing."" The government is now studying whether to require telephone companies to hold the data, or to create a new third-party agency to collect the data.","""Report appropriately calls into question"" program's legalitity, Sen. Leahy says .

"During Monday night's foreign-policy focused presidential debate, President Barack Obama made the case that al Qaeda in Pakistan is decimated while former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney argued they are on the rise in other countries: . The claims: . Obama: Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated. Romney: This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism. Fact Check: Romney, Obama and Iraq . The facts: . There's no disputing that al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, was killed in 2011 in a highly successful mission in Pakistan approved by Obama.  Romney has tipped his hat to the military and intelligence professionals who orchestrated that raid. The Obama administration also dramatically upped the operation of armed unmanned aircraft in Pakistan, with nearly 300 strikes so far and greatly increased the number of al Qaeda and other extremists taken off the battlefield. Most of those killed were foot soldiers, but besides bin Laden, some of the key players killed in recent years include: Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, the No. 2 to current leader Ayman al Zawahiri; Sayeed al-Masri, No. 3 in the hierarchy; and Abu Ayyub al Masri, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq. Although Obama at times speaks more broadly about al Qaeda being on the run, his top national security team has consistently zeroed in on al Qaeda's core leadership, which is hiding out in Pakistan. Obama was careful to specify that in this last debate. Fact Check: Comparing costs of Iraq, Libya missions . Just last month, National Counterterrorism Director Matt Olsen said, ""The intelligence picture shows that al Qaeda's core is a shadow of its former self and the overall threat from al Qaeda in Pakistan is diminished."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta predicted last year after the bin Laden strike that if the U.S. keeps up the pressure, ""I'm convinced that we're within reach of strategically defeating al Qaeda,"" again a reference to the Pakistan-based leaders. What's worrisome are al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen, North Africa and elsewhere in the Mideast. ""Even as al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan struggles to remain relevant, the terrorist threat we face has become more diverse,"" Olsen said.  ""Al Qaeda has turned to other groups to carry out attacks and to advance its ideology.  These groups are based in an array of countries, including Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria and in Iraq."" Of particular concern is al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates in Yemen. When Obama took office in 2009, AQAP was a newly formed affiliate, the result of a merger between al Qaeda forces fleeing Saudi Arabia and jihadists in Yemen. A locally focused group quickly became a more powerful al Qaeda franchise soon plotting attacks outside Yemen's borders. First there was the failed attempt by a suicide bomber in the summer of 2009 to kill the Saudi prince who ran the country's counterterrorism campaign. By the end of that year, AQAP was behind the attempt by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit on Christmas Day. Plans by AQAP to blow up cargo planes destined for the United States in 2010 and to put a suicide bomber aboard a passenger aircraft earlier this year were thwarted by U.S. and allied intelligence services. Fact Check: Romney against Afghanistan 2012 deadline? AQAP and al-Shabaab, the affiliated extremist group in Somalia, have been under sustained pressure by government and regional forces with assistance from the United States, but CIA Director David Petraeus said at a congressional hearing earlier this year that although AQAP, al-Shabaab and others have ""sustained important losses ... the threat of terrorism remains significant and we must sustain the campaign, we must maintain the pressure on al Qaeda and its affiliates."" The Arab Spring has resulted in fundamental changes in many parts of the region, but the continued instability and fledgling governments also prevent an opportunity for terrorists. ""Al Qaeda was not part of this change, but the group is seeking to take advantage of the unrest in some areas, seeking to establish safe havens and recruit extremists where security is diminished,"" Olsen said. Of particular concern are large swaths of Libya and Mali where extremists, some associated with al Qaeda, have found refuge. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which operates in northern Africa, is one of the group seen to be taking advantage of the situation. Lt. Gen. Ronald Burgess, recently retired as Defense Intelligence Agency director, told Congress that ""AQIM acquired weapons from Libya this year, kidnapped Westerners and continues its support to Nigerian based Boko Haram.""  Boko Haram is an insurgent group in Nigeria with a goal of creating an Islamic state in the northern part of the country. The unrest in Syria has provided an opportunity for al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) which according to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has extended its reach into the war-torn nation. Although AQI's presense in Syria is considered small, intelligence officials worry it will grow as the chaos continues. Clapper said that while al Qaeda core's in Pakistan will remain mostly a symbolic importance to the global jihadist movement, the regional affiliates ""will drive the global jihad agenda."" Fact Check: Obama's apology tour? The conclusion: . Both claims are true. Al Qaeda's core leadership has been seriously weakened, but the affiliates remain active, particularly in Yemen and North Africa, where the threat to Western interests and plotting against the homeland remain strong. Romney's claim that al Qaeda is in 10 to 12 countries is in the ballpark, and the administration would seem to agree that poses an enormous threat.

Previously, a multilateral campaign against Al-Shabaab undertaken by United Nation's sanctioned African Union forces, including many from the Kenyan military, was being touted as a great counterinsurgency success story, both for the African Union and the United States. Indeed, the Obama administration directly backed the African Union forces, participated in the counterinsurgency with targeted drone and air strikes and recently formally recognized the new Somali government. Beginning in 2011, the counterinsurgents pushed Al-Shabaab out of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, and made it nearly impossible for Al-Shabaab to hold territory even in its former strongholds in southern Somalia. This was a stunning turnaround for parts of Somalia. Despite these major counterinsurgent victories, many analysts interpret the recent attacks as a sign of a resurgent Al-Shabaab. The New York Times, for instance, reports that according to senior American counterterrorism and diplomatic officials the attack shows the Somali militants are as dangerous as ever. If Al-Shabaab, with its increasing ties to global jihadi groups, is capable of such spectacular attacks, the argument goes, it is stronger than we thought. Victory was declared too soon. Nothing could be further from the truth. The goal of Al-Shabaab is to rule Somalia. In order to do so, it must hold territory. By holding territory rebel groups establish political control, build operational capacity and gain recruits. Terrorism is a tactic used to spread fear. It is not a tactic suited to holding territory. So, in analyzing the attack in Kenya, one must ask why Al-Shabaab has resorted to a tactic so ill-suited to its goals. The answer is that terrorist and other unconventional attacks are now all that Al-Shabaab can manage, precisely because of the success of the counterinsurgent campaign against it. Terrorism is a weapon of the weak. Rebel groups turn to terrorism when they lack the human and material resources required to field a fighting force capable of using conventional tactics that might actually take and hold territory. That is, terrorist attacks are a sign that rebels are losing -- not winning. This is a pattern that has been seen repeatedly throughout the history of counterinsurgency. Brutal but effective Russian counterinsurgency efforts in the second Chechen war degraded Chechen rebels' public support and operational capacity. In response, those rebels shifted tactics, resulting in dramatic terrorist attacks in the Moscow Metro in 2010. Those attacks, though deadly, were a sign of a Chechen rebellion no longer able to seriously challenge Russian counterinsurgents. After the Tet offensive during the Vietnam War, when American and South Vietnamese operations rested local control over a village, mobilization for the North Vietnamese declined in those villages and, as a result, conventional attacks by the North Vietnamese decreased and unconventional attacks by the Viet Cong increased. The rise of the Irish Republican Army as a terrorist organization can be largely attributed to similar dynamics. After its defeat in the civil war of the early 1920s, the remaining IRA rebels, unable to field a conventional fighting force capable of conventional operations against British and Free State forces, turned to terrorist tactics and assassinations. Counterinsurgency is a strategically complex business. Rebels shift tactics and strategies in response to changes to their operational environment. Consequently, it is a mistake to expect that every counterinsurgent victory will be followed by a reduction in all forms of violence. We must learn to recognize when an uptick in violence is really a sign of resurgence and when it is a sign of a rebel group on its heels, fighting for survival. Terrorist attacks by groups like Al-Shabaab that used to control large amounts of territory are an instance of the latter phenomenon. No rebel group loses quietly. But governments must show resolve in the face of attacks, which should be understood for what they are—a sign the counterinsurgents are winning.","The Somali group Al-Shabaab attacked a mall and other targets in Kenya, killing many .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Two mentally disabled women were strapped with explosives Friday and sent into busy Baghdad markets, where they were blown up by remote control, a top Iraqi government official said. Iraqi soldiers secure the scene of a bombing Friday at a popular pet market in central Baghdad. The bombs killed at least 98 people and wounded more than 200 at two popular pet markets on the holiest day of the week for Muslims, authorities said. In both bombings, the attackers were mentally disabled women whose explosive belts were remotely detonated, Gen. Qasim Atta, spokesman for Baghdad's security plan, told state television. Atta said the women were strapped with dynamite and ball bearings, citing members of the bomb squad. The explosives were detonated via cell phone, he said. An Atta aide said that people referred to the bomber at central Baghdad's al-Ghazl market as the ""crazy woman"" and that the bomber at a second market had an unspecified birth disability. The aide said authorities believe the women were unaware of plans to detonate the explosives.  Watch how the use of the women represents a new tactic » . The nationalities and identities of the women have not been released. U.S. military officials referred to the two attacks as suicide bombings, saying both women detonated the explosive devices. The U.S. officials also gave a much lower casualty toll, with 27 civilians dead and 53 others wounded. The Pentagon attributed the attacks to al Qaeda in Iraq and made no reference to the mental conditions of the women. ""By targeting innocent Iraqis, they show their true demonic character,"" said Lt. Col. Steve Stover, spokesman for the Multi-National Division-Baghdad. ""They care nothing for the Iraqi people; they want to subjugate them and forcefully create a greater Islamic sharia state,"" he said, referring to Islamic law. The violence marked the bloodiest series of attacks in Baghdad since August, breaking a brief stretch of relative calm as attacks and deaths dropped after the 2007 increase in U.S. troop strength called the surge. In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the attacks show the reality of the continuing struggle against militants, adding that Iraqis have turned against ""these terrible, violent people in their midst who will do anything."" ""It certainly underscores and affirms the decision of the Iraqi people that there is no political program here that is acceptable to a civilized society, and that this is the most brutal and the most bankrupt of movements that would do this kind of thing,"" she said at a press briefing. ""And I think that will underscore for the Iraqis, and it will make them tougher in the fight."" The first bomb blew up at al-Ghazl animal market around 10:30 a.m., killing 69 and wounding more than 140. The second blast happened about a half-hour later in the New Baghdad neighborhood pet market, killing 29 people and wounding 67. Al-Ghazl pet market is a popular destination where people buy and sell cats, dogs, monkeys and other animals. Attackers have struck the market on Fridays -- its busiest day -- several times in the last year or so. A January 2007 bombing killed 15 and wounded 52 at the pet market, and 13 people died and 58 were wounded in a November attack. Other developments .

"It's only going to get worse unless you give us more money, administration officials warned Thursday about the flood of Central American children illegally entering the United States from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told the Senate Appropriations Committee that $3.7 billion in emergency funding requested by President Barack Obama anticipated up to 90,000 of the unaccompanied minors this fiscal year, which ends September 30, and another 145,000 in fiscal year 2015. So far, the 57,000 who crossed the Texas border in the past nine months have overwhelmed the immigration system, causing overcrowded holding facilities and a huge backlog of cases awaiting hearings that can take years to schedule. ""Doing nothing is not an option,"" Johnson said, noting the increased demand for his department's services would cause U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to run out of money next month while Customs and Border Protection would burn through its annual funding by mid-September. Emergency funding . The emergency money sought by the President would hire more border patrol officers, judges and others to deal with the unprecedented influx from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador while providing more detention facilities and other resources -- all designed to speed up the processing of the child immigrants. However, the deep partisan divide over the immigration issue set up a certain congressional battle over the funding. Earlier Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner erupted in anger over what he called Obama's lack of leadership on the issue, telling reporters that ""this is a problem of the President's own making."" ""He's been President for five and a half years,"" the Ohio Republican thundered. ""When is he going to take responsibility for something?"" After Obama's Texas trip, what now for the immigration crisis? While motivated in part by the rolling TV cameras, Boehner's outburst also responded to salvos fired at  him by Obama on a two-day trip to Texas -- the epicenter of the immigration influx -- in the endless effort to gain political advantage. Seeking political advantage . On Wednesday night, Obama told reporters in Dallas that Republicans put party gain over progress in resolving what the White House calls an urgent humanitarian situation -- tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors overwhelming the immigration system after illegally entering the United States in recent months. ""The problem here is not a major disagreement around the actions that could be helpful in dealing with the problem,"" he said, but whether Congress would ""put the resources in place to get this done,"" adding: ""Are folks more interested in politics, or are they more interested in solving the problem?"" Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other Republicans lashed out at Obama, particularly his decision not to tour overcrowded border facilities while in Texas to see for himself the human side of the situation. ""The American people expect to see their President when there is a disaster,"" Perry told CNN's Kate Bolduan in an interview that aired Thursday, citing Obama's trip to the East Coast to tour damage caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. ""He showed up at Sandy. Why not Texas?"" Texas governor lashes out at Obama over immigration crisis . 'Go down there and see what we're facing' Even some Democrats were critical of the decision. Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar told CNN's ""New Day"" that it's important for Obama to see what the children are going through. ""I'm interested in him looking at the kids. The kids that I've talked to, little innocent little boys and girls that have come across and have traveled over 1,000 miles, that a third of the girls have been abused and raped on the way up here,"" he said. ""The last young kid was an 11-year-old little boy from Guatemala that died of dehydration. That is the face that I want him to see. Don't take any cameras, Mr. President, but go down there and see what we're facing."" Obama said Wednesday that visiting facilities where the children are processed and detained would be little more than a photo opportunity. ""There's nothing that is taking place down there that I am not intimately aware of and briefed on. This isn't theater. This is a problem,"" he said. Other Democrats from states bordering Mexico questioned Obama's handling of the problem, indicating major challenges for the emergency funding sought by the President. Immigration limbo . Obama called on Congress to quickly approve the $3.7 billion in additional money this fiscal year to deal with the crisis, which has left tens of thousands of new undocumented immigrants in a kind of immigration limbo. A lot of them surrendered themselves to Customs and Border Protection officers on the belief they will be allowed to stay in the country, and officials have struggled to house the children amid a staggering backlog of immigration cases. To Boehner and other Republicans, Obama gets the blame because of his past decision to halt deportations of some young undocumented immigrants. ""On our southern border, we've got a true humanitarian crisis underway with children caught in the middle,"" Boehner said, adding that Obama's actions ""gave false hope to children and their families (that) if they entered the country illegally, they would be allowed to stay."" Criticized by Obama for preventing a House vote on a Senate-passed immigration reforms that would provide a path to legal status for millions of undocumented people living in  America, Boehner said he wanted the House to take up legislation addressing the current influx before it goes on recessin August. However, he made clear Obama's emergency funding plan would get serious scrutiny, saying: ""We are not giving the President a blank check."" Is the immigration crisis Rick Perry's second act? Process overwhelmed . Obama administration officials blame the influx on dire conditions in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the three countries of origin for most of the new child immigrants. They note that people from other countries don't join the influx, saying that showed it involves those fleeing bad conditions in the three Central American nations. To Boehner, Perry and other Republicans, the administration invited the problem. ""The children are a symptom of policies that have enticed them to come,"" he said. ""The first thing you have to do is stop the flow, because if we don't, then the problem's not going to be the size we have today."" Republicans have called for the repeal of a 2008 law signed by President George W. Bush that requires deportation hearings before sending back children from countries that do not border the United States. ""I don't think we can solve the problem unless we revisit"" the law, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said. ""What's happened is these children are placed with family members in the United States and given a notice to appear for a later court hearing. Some have called this a notice to disappear, not a notice to appear,"" as most don't show up, he said. Another Republican, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said the United States should immediately fly the children back to their home countries. It would cost less and signal U.S. intolerance for those who enter the country illegally, he argued. Cornyn and Cuellar planned to introduce legislation Thursday to alter the 2008 deportation hearing provision. The bill, Cuellar said, will include protections for children who come to the United States because of concerns about drug or sex trafficking. Democrats want to keep the law intact to ensure that children who deserve asylum receive a full hearing. Funding breakdown . Obama's emergency funding request seeks $1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts as well as crack down on smugglers. Another $300 million would go to help Mexico and Central American governments counter claims by smugglers to desperate parents that U.S. officials won't send their children back. ""While we intend to do the right thing by these children, their parents need to know that this is an incredibly dangerous situation and it is unlikely that their children will be able to stay,"" Obama said. The request also includes $1.8 billion to provide care for unaccompanied children crossing the border. Overall, it amounts to about 10% of the $30 billion in proposed border security funding included in the immigration reform bill passed by the Senate but stalled in the Republican-controlled House. 5 things you need to know about the immigration crisis .

"(CNN) -- The Detroit Free Press and Detroit News will become the first major metropolitan newspapers in the U.S. to end daily home delivery, the papers announced Tuesday. The Detroit News will still be available on newsstands daily, newspaper officials said Tuesday. ""We're fighting for our survival,"" said David Hunke, publisher of the Free Press and CEO of the Detroit Media Partnership, a joint operating agreement between the two papers. ""We think its time to take a geometric leap forward in what we've known as newspapers."" Beginning sometime in the first three months of 2009, the two newspapers will provide home delivery on Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays only, Hunke said during a news conference in Detroit, Michigan. Papers will be on newsstands every day, and the papers' online offerings will be expanded, he said. ""The dynamics of delivering information to audiences has changed forever due to technology,"" Hunke said in a statement on the plan. Costs for paper, ink and fuel to deliver papers were forcing the papers into cuts in newsroom talent that would damage their abilities to report the news, Hunke said. Paying for delivery vehicles to cover 300,000 miles nightly, he said, did not make economic sense at a time when 63 percent of readers have broadband Internet access. As for those without computers and broadband access at home, ""this isn't necessarily gonna be the best news for them,"" Hunke said. ""Our economics have become unsustainable,"" said Jonathan Wolman, publisher and editor of the Detroit News. ""We've got to embrace reality, and we've got to embrace innovation,"" said Paul Anger, executive editor of the Free Press, owned by Gannett Corp., the country's largest newspaper publisher. The Free Press, the nation's 20th-largest daily paper, had a daily circulation of 298,243 and 605,000 on Sunday as of the end of September. Those numbers were down almost 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively, from the previous six months, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The Detroit News, the country's 49th largest newspaper, is owned by MediaNews Group and had a daily circulation of 178,280 in September. It does not publish a Sunday edition. The Free Press' circulation is down 19 percent and the News is down 22 percent since 2002, the Free Press reported Tuesday. Hunke said the newspapers would face about a 9 percent reduction in their workforces under the plan. However no layoffs in their newsrooms, which he described as ""fiercely competitive,"" were planned. The Detroit Media Partnership employs more than 2,100 people, CNN affiliate WDIV-TV reported. Personnel cuts would be negotiated with the papers' unions, Hunke said. ""We believe it will break the cycle of buyouts and downsizing"" that has become common in the newspaper industry, Wolman said. Newspaper publishers have had a rough year. Across the industry, daily circulation dropped 4.6 percent in the six months ending in September. Gannett has been in the process of cutting 10 percent of its workforce across its 85 newspapers nationwide. McClatchy Co., the nation's second-largest newspaper company, has been pursuing cuts at its papers, including the Miami Herald. Tribune Co., which owns the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, among others, announced earlier this month it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The East Valley Tribune in Mesa, Arizona, a 100,000-circulation newspaper owned by Freedom Newspapers, announced in October it would move from a daily to a four-day publication beginning in January. The national Christian Science Monitor is moving its daily content online and dropping its daily print edition next year. Anger said Tuesday that Detroit readers have been seeking those kinds of changes in how they get their news. ""Generations of readers are telling us they'd like information delivered in a different way,"" he said, promising ""a fast reading, provocative news report in print as well as online."" The Detroit papers will price their three-day home delivery subscriptions at $12 a month, including a daily edition delivered by e-mail, Hunke said. Wolman said mail subscriptions would be available to home-bound readers.","Detroit Free Press, Detroit News will deliver to homes only three days a week .

"Washington (CNN) -- Keenly conscious of his image, a graying Osama bin Laden no doubt never expected this video -- showing him hunched over, draped in a blanket and using a television clicker -- to hit the world's airwaves as it did Saturday. Filmed by a confidant, the al Qaeda leader contrasts with the younger version of himself on a TV screen a few feet away. That man has a more youthful beard, a hand held up in resolve and a photo of the burning World Trade Center. U.S. officials, who Saturday released five videos, emphasized the recordings and other materials seized at bin Laden's Pakistan compound show the terrorist still had a firm hand at the tiller, managing strategic and tactical control of his organization, even as he stayed out of sight in Abbottabad. The undated videos make clear bin Laden ""remained active in al Qaeda terrorist propaganda operations, especially in shaping his own image,"" said a senior intelligence official granted anonymity under the ground rules of a briefing at the Pentagon. Four of the clips show bin Laden, who was killed along with four others Monday by U.S. commandos, in more formal attire. No audio of the terrorist leader speaking accompanied the images. What bin Laden 'home videos' reveal . The intelligence official said the audio was removed because it would be ""inappropriate to spread the words of terrorists and propaganda messages, especially Osama bin Laden."" Besides the missing audio, the videos, according to the intelligence official, were not altered in any other way. Still, the release of the home movies sends a message to those who doubted bin Laden was killed: Navy SEALs got footage that likely could have been held only by bin Laden at his hideout. It may also have accomplished something else: diminishing the bin Laden mythology of invincibility. Video shows new side of bin Laden . CNN national security contributor Frances Townsend said U.S. officials ""picked these videos pretty deliberately."" Portions are unflattering of bin Laden and reflect his vanity, Townsend said. Some of the videos indicate problems with production value. Bin Laden misses a cue in one and another shows him with a wrinkled backdrop. Phone call tipped off U.S. officials to bin Laden . The candid recording of an aging bin Laden, stroking his beard, reviewing news footage and calling up a DVD menu, portrays him as an ordinary man, not a terror mastermind. Bin Laden wears a dark wool cap, slightly rocking in his seat in the spartan surroundings. Images on the TV screen include U.S. President Barack Obama, bin Laden handling an AK-47 rifle, troops and other scenes. The videos lifted a corner of the tent on materials seized by U.S. commandos, including reams of documents, disks, thumb drives, computers and more. Analysts have pored over them for evidence of further plots or operations. Bin Ladenism withered after 9/11 . ""The materials reviewed over the past several days clearly show that bin Laden remained an active leader in al Qaeda, providing strategic, operational and tactical instructions to the group,"" the intelligence official said. ""Though separated from many al Qaeda members who are located in more remote areas of the region, he was far from a figurehead. He was an active player making the recent operation even more essential for our nation's security."" But U.S. officials would not describe any of that material in detail Saturday. They did say that the intelligence reveals bin Laden and al Qaeda had a driving interest in taking on the United States and that the leader was involved in the details of plotting attacks. Bin Laden's bride, 18, was confident, conservative . One of the videos is a message to the United States officials believe was recorded in October or November and is entitled ""A Message to the American People."" In that video, which had not been broadcast by al Qaeda, bin Laden's beard has been dyed black and he was well-composed as he delivered his message. The three other videos are practice sessions for videos he was planning to release to the world. In one, bin Laden stands in front of an armoire. Preliminary analysis suggests that the armoire matches one at the compound, the senior intelligence official told reporters. The videos were shown amid the Obama administration's decision not to release photos of the slain bin Laden and bury the al Qaeda leader at sea. Watch full videos of bin Laden . The senior intelligence official briefing reporters said Monday's raid by U.S. forces yielded a significant amount of intelligence, and that a special federal task force -- including members of the CIA and FBI -- is combing through the material. The official also said the DNA evidence unquestionably shows that the person shot and killed in the Pakistan compound was bin Laden. The intelligence officials said they are trying to determine what bin Laden's death means to the future of al Qaeda and are trying to get clues to the locations of the other top al Qaeda leaders. The No. 2 man in al Qaeda is Ayman al-Zawahiri; another top militant is Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S. born militant who is a leader in the group's Yemen branch. This week, al-Awlaki eluded a drone attack in southern Yemen as security personnel continue their hunt for him, Yemeni and American officials said. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","One video appears to be a home video of bin Laden .
Another is a message to the United States .
Officials say the DNA evidence is unquestionable -- it's bin Laden ."

"(Mental Floss) -- In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Barack Obama promised his daughters Sasha and Malia that they'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January. President Bush's dog Barney, left, plays in 2001 with Spot, the offspring of George H.W. Bush's dog Millie. It's a good thing Obama said ""Yes, we can"" to the girls' request to getting a dog; for all of his charm, ability, and oratorical flair, he could never be our nation's chief executive without a White House pet. Counting Obama, the country has had 44 Presidents, and only two of them -- Chester A. Arthur and Franklin Pierce -- left no record of having pets. Like Obama himself, the family pooch will have some big shoes to fill. Previous White House pets have set the bar pretty high. iReport.com: What pet would you want if you lived in the White House? Here are a few of our favorites:  Watch Obama on ""mutts like me"" » . 1. Billy: Calvin Coolidge's pygmy hippopotamus . Calvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence, but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets. After taking over the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections. He had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo » . Billy was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age. He came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.) Coolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success. He sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring. Mental Floss: 7 crafty zoo escapes . 2. The White House gators . Herbert Hoover wanted to put a chicken in every pot, a car in every garage, and ... a gator in the Oval Office? It's true. Hoover owned a slew of dogs, but those weren't his only pets. His second son, Allan Henry Hoover, owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds. Sound crazy? Blame John Quincy Adams for setting the precedent. The sixth president also had a pet gator. His was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette; it lived in a bathroom in the East Room of the White House. According to some reports, he enjoyed using the gator to scare his guests. 3. Fala: FDR's traveling companion . What do you get the Depression-conquering president who has everything? A lapdog. In 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend. FDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill, after a Scottish ancestor. For the sake of simplicity, though, he called his new pal Fala. After that, Fala became FDR's inseparable companion and traveled everywhere the President went. The dog ""gave"" $1 a day to the war effort, generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army. Each morning when FDR's breakfast tray came in, it included a bone for Fala. Fala also made a famous appearance in one of his master's speeches. When FDR was decrying personal attacks from his political opponents, he jokingly said that it was okay to mock him, but leave Fala alone. ""You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I had left him behind on the Aleutian Islands and had sent a destroyer back to find him -- at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or 20 million dollars -- his Scotch soul was furious. ""He has not been the same dog since!"" Fala stayed with FDR until the President's death in 1945 and lived in the care of Eleanor Roosevelt until his death in 1952. Mental Floss: 6 utterly loyal dogs . 4. Millie: Literary sensation . When George H.W. Bush took office in 1989, he brought his pet springer spaniel Millie to the White House. The bubbly canine won over the nation's heart so completely that she even collaborated with the First Lady on Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush. Millie brought further joy to the Bush family when she gave birth to a litter of six presidential puppies in 1989. Just as her master helped slip one of his boys into the White House, so did Millie: when George W. Bush moved into the Oval Office, so did his dog, Millie's son Spot Fetcher. 5. Barney, Miss Beazley & India: The current residents . Sadly, Spot Fetcher had to be put down in 2004, but the Bushes aren't pet-deprived now. They have a pair of Scottish Terriers named Barney and Miss Beazley, both of whom have websites and appear in White House-produced web videos. (Your tax dollars adorably at work!) The Bushes also have a black cat named India, who also goes by ""Willie.""  Watch Barney bite a reporter » . The name India rankled some citizens of the country of the same name to the point that many Indians supposedly named their dogs ""Bush."" The name wasn't meant to be controversial, though; the Bushes merely named their cat after Ruben ""El Indio"" Sierra, who played for the Texas Rangers while George W. owned the team. Spot Fetcher was similarly named after former Rangers middle infielder Scott Fletcher. Other first pets of note: . Mr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection -- Benjamin Harrison's two opossums. Harrison's son Russell also had a pet goat named Old Whiskers. Pauline -- The last cow to live at the White House. She made milk for President Taft's consumption. Old Ike -- To save cash during World War I, Woodrow Wilson brought in a flock of sheep to take care of the White House's groundskeeping duties. Old Ike, a ram, supposedly chewed tobacco. Laddie Boy -- Warren G. Harding's beloved Airedale who had his own seat at Cabinet meetings and gave a 1921 ""interview"" with The Washington Post in which he talked about Prohibition and shortening the workday for guard dogs. Liberty -- Gerald Ford's golden retriever hung out in the Oval Office and could supposedly read a sign from Ford that she should go be affectionate to guests -- a cute and cuddly way to gracefully end the President's conversations. Socks and Buddy -- President Clinton's faithful cat and the chocolate lab he acquired while in office. Socks didn't like Buddy's youthful friendliness, so the two pets had to be kept separated at all times. The tensions were so bad that the family couldn't keep both pets at the end of Bill's second term, so Socks went to live with Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie. Gamecocks -- Ulysses S. Grant supposedly kept some gamecocks at the White House. Two tiger cubs -- Martin Van Buren received the cats as a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Congress supposedly made him give the gift to a zoo. Satan -- One of Abigail Adams' unfortunately named dogs. She called the other one Juno.

"Nearly 20 suspected Boko Haram gunmen opened fire on market vendors in Nigeria, killing 15 people in Borno state, witnesses say. They also burned a local traders market, several homes and a church, said residents who survived the Sunday attack on the remote Christian village of Daku in the district of Askira Uba. This is the latest raid in northeast Borno state near Chibok, where militants from the Islamist group shocked the world when they kidnapped nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls two months ago. ""The gunmen looted food items and money left by traders while fleeing the attack,"" eyewitness and resident Andrew Musa said of Sunday's violence. ""They pursued people who attempted to flee into nearby bushes and shot them."" ""We recovered 15 bodies from the bushes after the attack, including that of the village chief,"" he added. In neighboring Yobe state on Sunday, gunmen on motorcycles stormed a mosque in Gumsa village during prayers and abducted the local chief, residents said.

"A Mississippi baby scientists thought was ""functionally cured"" of HIV now has detectable levels of the virus in her blood, her doctors say. The news is disappointing for a case the scientific community hailed just last year as a potential game changer in the fight against AIDS. ""It felt like a punch to the gut,"" Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, said of seeing signs of the virus on test results earlier this month. ""It was extremely disappointing from both the scientific standpoint ... but mainly for the sake of the child who is back on medicine and expected to stay on medicine for a very long time."" Media outlets around the world covered the Mississippi case when it was first made public in March 2013. CNN updated its story again in October when researchers announced the toddler was still HIV free. The child was born to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as HIV-positive herself until just before delivery. ""We didn't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able to do, to prevent transmission to the baby,"" Gay said last year. Doctors administered high doses of three antiretroviral drugs 30 hours after the girl was born in case she was infected. They hoped to control the virus, which was not detectable at the time. The child remained on antiretroviral drugs for approximately 18 months. Her mother then stopped administering the drugs for an unknown reason. A few months later, doctors said the little girl had no evidence of the life-threatening disease in her blood. They announced that the girl was the first child to be ""functionally cured"" of HIV. A ""functional cure"" is when the presence of the virus is so small, lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests cannot detect the virus in the blood. However, during a routine doctor visit early this month, tests detected HIV antibodies in the now 4-year-old child. Her T-cell count was also low, indicating a weakened immune system. More than two years after being taken off the medication, doctors started her again on antiretroviral therapy. She will need to be on these medications for life -- or until scientists find a cure for HIV. ""Certainly, this is a disappointing turn of events for this young child, the medical staff involved in the child's care, and the HIV/AIDS research community,"" NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a statement. ""Scientifically, this development reminds us that we still have much more to learn about the intricacies of HIV infection and where the virus hides in the body."" Despite the setback, researchers are optimistic about using this early treatment method on infants infected with HIV. A clinical trial aimed at studying the effect will be amended to include this new information, they said, before it begins recruiting participants. ""We´ve always known that the search for an HIV cure wasn't going to be easy,"" Françoise Barre-Sinoussi, president of the International AIDS Society, said in a statement. ""Cases like this are hugely important for informing researchers on where to focus their efforts."" Current treatment methods . Researchers have long known that treating HIV-positive mothers while they are pregnant is important for the health of the child because they pass antibodies on to their babies that can protect them from disease. All HIV-positive moms will pass on those antibodies, but only 30% will transmit the actual virus, said Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts who worked closely with Gay. And HIV-positive mothers who are given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than 2% of cases. ""So all babies are born antibody-positive, but only a fraction of babies born to HIV-positive women will actually get the virus, and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis (preventive treatment) or not."" Newborns are considered high-risk if their mothers' HIV infections are not under control or if the mothers are found to be HIV-positive when they're close to delivering. Usually, these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventive doses for six weeks to prevent infection, then start antiretroviral therapy, or ART, if HIV is diagnosed. ART is a combination of at least three drugs used to suppress the virus and stop the progression of the disease. But they do not kill the virus. In March, doctors announced that another child born with HIV appeared to be free of the virus after receiving similar treatment to the Mississippi baby. The case report was presented at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston. The girl was delivered at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, California, last summer to a mother with HIV who had not received antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy. Doctors gave the baby high doses of three drugs -- AZT, 3TC and Nevirapine -- four hours after birth. Eleven days later, the virus was undetectable in her body and remained undetectable eight months later. ""Taking kids off antiretroviral therapy intentionally is not standard of care,"" said Dr. Deborah Persaud at the time, a virologist with Johns Hopkins Children's Center who has been involved in both cases. On Thursday Persaud said the California baby is still on antiretroviral treatment and doing well, said Persaud. ""At this time, there is no plan to stop treatment.""

"U.S. officials have deported a woman believed to be the daughter of Mexico's most wanted drug lord. Alejandrina Gisselle Guzman Salazar was deported on Tuesday, her lawyer said, a day after she pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of a false visa. Shortly after Guzman Salazar's arrest in October, a U.S. federal official told CNN that she was the daughter of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, who authorities have said heads Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. On Wednesday, her lawyers declined to comment on whether she was related to the accused drug lord. ""I don't know the answer to that, and it wasn't part of the case. ... We never asked, because it wasn't relevant, whether it was true or not,"" attorney Guadalupe Valencia said. Read more: Mexican police deny accused drug lord's government corruption claims . Another attorney for Guzman Salazar, Jan Ronis, said he watched her cross into Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday, but he declined to comment on where she headed after that. In October, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents arrested Guzman Salazar at the international crossing in San Ysidro, California. A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment Wednesday on whether she had been deported, citing privacy rules. U.S. District Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo ordered her released on time served after a hearing Monday, according to court documents. In a plea agreement, she admitted to possessing and attempting to use a fraudulent visa to gain entry to the United States. Guzman Salazar is between seven and eight months' pregnant, Valencia said. She entered with a false visa in October because she wanted to give birth in the United States, he said. ""All these facts were part of the public record that she wanted to come and have her baby here,"" he said. ""We live in the greatest country in the world, and people want to come here to live and give their kids an opportunity to be here, so that was it."" Guzman Salazar is a doctor working as a general practitioner, he said. ""When she's back in Mexico, hopefully she can go on living her normal private life,"" Valencia said. ""El Chapo"" Guzman is the boss of the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking operations. His nickname, which means ""shorty,"" matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame, though he has climbed to great heights in the drug smuggling business. Forbes magazine has estimated ""El Chapo"" is worth $1 billion. The U.S. Treasury Department has declared him the most influential trafficker in the world, and Mexican authorities have been on his tail since his 2001 escape from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart. 17 killed in attempted prison break in northern Mexico .

"Roger Rodas' widow is suing Porsche for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of her race car driver husband and actor Paul Walker. Kristine Rodas filed the suit this week against Porsche Cars North America, citing negligence as the cause of death of her husband and the 40-year-old ""Fast and the Furious"" star on November 30 in Santa Clarita, California. Backed by celebrity attorney Mark Geragos, she is also suing for product liability and wrongful death. Roger Rodas, 38 at the time of his death, spent his competitive racing career driving Porsche cars. According to the court documents, he and Walker first met on the race track when Rodas was driving a Porsche owned by the actor. A few years later the two men formed the racing team Always Evolving Racing, where they were both drivers. ""Although Mr. Rodas had a passion for cars, Mr. Rodas was first and foremost dedicated to his family, his wife, Kristine, and their two young children,"" the complaint states. The court documents filed by Kristine Rodas describe the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT that her husband was driving as a an ""ultra-high-performance-super-sports car for the road,"" that goes from zero to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 205 miles per hour. The complaint argues that such a high-powered sports car should have a higher standard of crash protection, and that a mechanical malfunction forced Rodas to veer off the road. Geragos also hired investigators to evaluate wreckage at the scene, who determined that Rodas was driving 55 mph before the vehicle went out of control. This contradicts the Los Angeles County coroner's report that car was speeding at more than 100 mph, and the investigations by the Los Angeles County Sherriff's Office and California Highway Patrol that focused on speed. Porsche pointed to the discrepancy. ""As you know, the crash was subject of a very detailed investigation by the authorities, both the California Highway Patrol and the L.A. County Sheriff's Office,"" said Bernd Harling, Head of Public Relations for Porsche Cars North America. ""The reports showed that driving at a high speed in a negligent manner caused the crash. Both concluded that there was no mechanical defect of the vehicle involved."" ""Their investigation disproves in the allegations in the lawsuit."" Harling added that since the crash is now the subject of litigation, Porsche will not comment on it further. He expressed his sincere condolences for the Rodas and Walker families' losses. Walker's former publicist Ame Van Iden does not have information about whether the Walker family is also considering legal action against Porsche. Walker is survived by his parents, Cheryl Walker and Paul Walker Sr., four siblings and 15-year-old daughter, Meadow.","Porsche is being sued over the fatal crash that killed Paul Walker and race car driver Roger Rodas .

"The Malaysian-registered tanker Zafirah was exactly the kind of ship pirates love. Slow, unguarded and steaming in the waters off Con Son Island near Vietnam as it labored under its cargo of 320 tons of marine gas oil (MGO), its low freeboard -- the distance between its deck and the water -- offered an open target. Most likely operating from a creaky pursuit skiff with an over-powered engine, 11 pirates armed with machetes, long knives and pistols easily boarded the tanker on November 20 last year. The nine crew of the Zafirah -- five Myanmar nationals and four Indonesians -- were forced into two life rafts, lowered into the water and left to their fate. Next the pirates worked feverishly to change the identity of the vessel. The ship's name was painted over on the stern and changed to MT Seahorse and the IMO (International Maritime Organization) number assigned to the hull altered. With a new identity, the Sarawak-bound tanker changed direction; steaming towards what was likely a ready buyer for the tanker and its cargo. Fortunately for the owners and crew of the Zafirah, good regional cooperation and information sharing led to the rescue of the crew and, after a 50-minute stand off with Vietnam's Marine Police, the recovery of the vessel and the arrest of the pirates. While piracy in Somalia in the waters off the Horn of Africa may have grabbed the headlines over the past few years, shipping industry experts say piracy is moving back to its former heartland in South East Asia. And, as fuel becomes one of shipping's biggest expenses, pirates are targeting valuable cargoes of highly saleable and easily transferred MGO - in some cases operating on the high seas as floating pumps for below-cost stolen bunker oil that is transferred from ship to ship. ""The statistics would seem to suggest it's on the rise in Asia,"" said an industry source from a Hong Kong-based ship management company who did not want to be named. ""It's now very dangerous for slow vessels with low freeboards to pass through piracy areas. ""A ship like the Zafirah would only have been doing 12 knots (14 mph), and most probably even slower to save on fuel,"" he said. According to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) -- an information sharing center set up under a regional Asian agreement to combat piracy -- the high price of oil has been behind at least four pirate attacks in 2011 and 2012 where diesel or MGO fuel was siphoned. ""It is a lucrative business believed to involve syndicates who target specific tankers with MGO onboard,"" ReCAAP says in its 2012 annual report on Asian piracy. ""It is believed that the culprits have access to insider information on the route taken by the tanker and possible locations where the siphoning process could be carried out. ""In incidents where the tanker was repainted, renamed and the crew abandoned onto life rafts, it appeared that there is a ready buyer for the tanker together with the cargo onboard, as in the case involving the Zafirah."" In the meantime, ship owners are prepared to pay a premium to protect ship, cargoes and crews in what has become a multi-million dollar industry for security firms and insurers. ""There are many new companies making good money providing 'hardening' equipment for ships,"" the Hong Kong-based source said. ""We need to supply shed loads of equipment for ships transiting high-risk areas in the Indian Ocean."" He said companies often need to provide camera surveillance equipment, razor wire, sandbags, bulletproof vests as well as extra provisions for the guards. ""Ship owners need to pay extra premiums for piracy or war risk areas, so for the insurance companies, it's big money too."" Certainly some of the anti-piracy measures outlined in the shipping industry's Best Management Practices against piracy would not be out of place in the days of Blackbeard -- the buccaneer that terrorised the Caribbean in the 18th century. Counter-piracy tactics include ringing the deck with razor wire, equipping freeboard areas with spiked fences, mesh grills on the bridge to deter RPG attacks, steam-jet nozzles and even strategic placement of dummies to make the ship appear better manned than it is. Above all, the guidelines advise ships' captains to proceed at full speed through pirate waters, noting that no ships have been boarded when the vessel has been sailing at more than 18 knots (20 mph). Some ships operating in Somali waters have even resorted to 'citadels'; safe rooms where the crew can barricade themselves into a ship that has already been boarded by pirates. Nevertheless, committed pirates hell bent on capturing valuable hostages have been known to take plastic explosives onto vessels to breach citadels, drill through bulkheads to pour in petrol or shoot at the doors indiscriminately and the industry is still divided on whether citadels are a safe haven or a death trap. While Asian waters have yet to reach the warzone status of the Horn of Africa, the numbers are showing a worrying return of piracy to the South China Seas and the Indian Ocean. According to statistics from the International Chamber of Commerce International Maritime Bureau, there have been 22 attacks in 2013 of which nine took place in waters around South East Asia. Due to increased policing, Somalia has registered just one incident this year but pirates in the African country still hold a total of seven captured vessels and ransoms for 113 hostages are still being negotiated. While Asian attacks tend to be of a less serious nature -- ranging from petty thefts of engine parts to large-scale thefts of valuable cargoes -- the maritime industry says ship owners, faced with increasing costs and lower revenues due to the global financial crisis, have cut the size of crews and in some cases their wages, a situation that leaves the door open to piracy. ""Sometimes it's suspected that these small robberies are even carried out by the crew who sell the supplies to boost their low salaries and later put the blame on pirates,"" the Hong Kong-based shipper said.","Sea piracy in the waters of South East Asia on the increase .

"(CNN)These are good times for anti-smoking campaigners. But you wouldn't know it from listening to their rhetoric. At the urging of anti-tobacco activists, the Department of Transportation is proposing to ban electronic cigarette use aboard aircraft. This impending regulation not only defies medical evidence but makes a mockery of the law in the process. The use of e-cigarettes among U.S. adults more than doubled between 2010 and 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The tobacco industry predicts e-cigarette sales will surpass traditional cigarettes in the coming decades. This signals great progress from a harm-reduction standpoint, since the best available scientific evidence suggests that while e-cigarettes may bring health risks, they are far smaller than those associated with tobacco smoking. Yet, anti-tobacco campaigners are increasingly agitating for strict rules against e-cigarette use, perversely threatening advances in public health. The risks associated with e-cigarettes are borne exclusively by the users, not the people around them. Unlike tobacco cigarettes, vaporizers do not produce harmful ""sidestream"" emissions -- the smoke released directly into the air from the end of lit cigarettes, which produces 85% of secondhand smoke and virtually all of its associated risks. As for the ""mainstream"" smoke inhaled by smokers, many of its harmful compounds are partially retained within the smoker's body, which acts as a filter before it is exhaled into the surrounding air. There is simply no evidence that secondhand aerosols exhaled by e-cigarette users endanger non-users. As Dr. Joel Nitzkin, a former co-chair of the Tobacco Control Task Force of the American Association of Public Health Physicians, said, ""[T]here is no public health justification for banning e-cigarette use in no-smoking areas."" Anti-tobacco activists who disingenuously equate vapor and tobacco smoke may perversely convince smokers to reject far safer e-cigarette alternatives. Consumers should not be misled to believe e-cigarettes, which do not produce tobacco smoke and its many concentrated toxins, pose the same risks as smoked tobacco. To be sure, airlines should be free to ban e-cigarettes aboard their aircraft if they so choose. But just like the use of cell phones on planes (or a passenger's odoriferous perfume, for that matter), the risks posed by e-cigarettes do not justify federal regulation. In 2011, the Department of Transportation initiated a regulatory proceeding to reinterpret ""smoke"" and ""smoking,"" in order to extend the existing federal ban on in-flight smoking to e-cigarettes. Now years delayed, the department quietly indicated in mid-January that it plans to finally issue a rule by the end of April to prohibit e-cigarette use aboard aircraft. Such an action runs counter to congressional intent and constitutes an illegal expansion of regulatory power. The DOT states that Congress' intent in prohibiting smoking in the skies was to ""improve air quality within the aircraft, reduce the risk of adverse health effects on passengers and crewmembers, and enhance aviation safety and passenger comfort."" The law was intended to address secondhand smoke, and the department concedes ""a vapor, rather than smoke, is produced."" So how does the Department of Transportation justify its proposal? By noting, that e-cigarettes ""require an inhalation and exhalation similar to smoking cigarettes."" So, by DOT's logic, when Congress referred to ""smoke"" and ""smoking,"" it meant anything that might vaguely resemble smoke and smoking, rather than smoke itself and its resulting harms, even though Congress enacted a clear law in which the terms ""smoke"" and ""smoking"" are not ambiguous. The Department of Transportation has no authority to regulate vaping, an area over which it has no jurisdiction. It may claim that it is simply interpreting ""smoking"" to cover the use of e-cigarettes, but as the Supreme Court has made it clear, an ""agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it has no jurisdiction"" by stretching the language of a statute. Regardless of one's views on whether airlines should permit e-cigarette use on their flights or not, the Department of Transportation's attempt to rewrite a law passed by Congress is an unlawful abuse of power. The looming in-flight e-cigarette ban has far more to do with pushing a nanny-state agenda than promoting illusory public health benefits.","Department of Transportation has a proposal to ban e-cigarettes in planes .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The nephew of Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi was buried Wednesday, three days after he was killed in anti-government demonstrations. Seyyed Ali Moussavi's body was delivered to his family early Wednesday and buried at Tehran's Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery around 10:30 a.m. (2 a.m. ET). There were no demonstrations or disturbances during the burial, and several plain-clothed and uniformed security personnel were patrolling the area. A reformist Web site, Parlemannews, had reported Tuesday that Moussavi's body had disappeared, though the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) disputed that account. Moussavi was one of seven people killed in the riots Sunday, according to Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran's chief prosecutor. The toll meant the riots were the bloodiest since June, when protests over the disputed presidential election that gave Ahmadinejad a second term left at least eight dead. The Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone. It is not clear how Moussavi died, though his uncle's political movement said he was shot to death. Are you in Iran? Show us what the scene is like . Dolatabadi said one of those killed was fatally shot and the case is under investigation, but he did not identify the victim. He said most of the seven deaths occurred after the people were struck with ""hard objects or due to similar causes."" Read more about the protests in Iran . Mir Hossein Moussavi's Web site said the nephew was killed in the demonstrations by a shot to the heart. But IRNA said the bullet came from a ""terror team,"" and that other such teams were operating in Tehran. It did not offer further details. The semi-official Mehr news agency quoted security forces Tuesday as explaining that the nephew was standing on a street at midday Sunday when he was ""assassinated by firearm by the occupants of a passing vehicle, and died because of the delay in taking him to the hospital."" ""He died of severe bleeding on the way to the hospital,"" Mehr reported. ""Efforts to identify the culprit or culprits continue."" Parlemannews, which reported the disappearance of Seyyed Ali Moussavi's body, said the government was holding it and four other bodies for autopsies. The delay meant the dead could not be buried within 24 hours, as Islamic custom dictates.

"As hospitals in nations hardest hit by Ebola struggle to keep up, desperate patients are turning to the black market to buy blood from survivors of the virus, the World Health Organization warned. The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history has killed at least 2,400 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the countries most affected by the virus. Blood from survivors, referred to as convalescent serum, is said to have antibodies that can fight the deadly virus. Though the treatment is unproven, it has provided some promise for those fighting a disease that's killing more than half of those it has infected. ""Studies suggest blood transfusions from survivors might prevent or treat Ebola virus infection in others, but the results of the studies are still difficult to interpret,"" the WHO said. ""It is not known whether antibodies in the plasma of survivors are sufficient to treat or prevent the disease. More research is needed."" Convalescent  serum has been used to treat patients, including American aid worker Rick Sacra, who is hospitalized in Omaha, Nebraska. He got blood from Kent Brantly, a fellow American who survived Ebola. Both got infected when they were helping patients in Liberia. But unlike their situation, patients in affected nations are getting blood through improper channels. The illicit trade can lead to the spread of other infections, including HIV and other blood-related ailments. ""We need to work very closely with the affected countries to stem out black market trading of convalescent serum for two reasons,"" Margaret Chan, the WHO's director-general, said this week. ""Because it is in the interest of individuals not to just get convalescent serum without ... going through the proper standard and the proper testing because it is important that there may be other infectious vectors that we need to look at."" 'Just sitting, waiting to die' Heath experts have declared the disease a global emergency and criticized the international community for a lax response. President Barack Obama on Tuesday announced the United States will send troops, material to build field hospitals, additional health care workers and community care kits to affected nations. The United States will also create a facility to help train thousands of health care workers to identify and care for Ebola patients. ""Men and women and children are just sitting, waiting to die right now,"" Obama said. Hospitals in affected nations are overwhelmed, and the WHO has described the outbreak as a ""dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions"" of human suffering. ""If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us,"" Obama said. What you need to know about the Ebola virus . There is also a concern that the virus could mutate into an even more dangerous form. Ebola currently transmits only through contact with bodily fluids; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to people worldwide, experts say. Meanwhile, a French volunteer with Doctors Without Borders contracted Ebola in Liberia and will be taken to France for further treatment, the group said Thursday. A private American plane will be used for the evacuation, according to the organization, which is known by its French acronym, MSF.","The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed at least 2,400 people .

"Paris (CNN) -- Nearly two years after an Air France plane mysteriously fell out of the sky, killing 228 people, the bulk of the wreckage has been found with bodies still aboard, French officials said Monday. The human remains will be brought to the surface and identified, French Ecology and Transportation Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet said at a news conference. Submarines searching for the wreck spotted two engines, the fuselage and landing gear over the weekend, officials said. But the flight data recorders have not been recovered, leaving investigators as puzzled as ever about why the plane crashed in stormy weather on June 1, 2009. ""It's still a jigsaw puzzle,"" said Alain Bouillard, who will be in charge of the recovery operation. ""We do not know where the recorders might be."" Kosciusko-Morizet said she was hopeful the flight data recorder, sometimes called the black box, would be found. ""The fact that we found various pieces, a lot of pieces of the plane in a quite concentrated area is a good hope for finding the black boxes, but we have no assurance,"" she said. It is impossible to tell how many bodies remain in the wreck, he added. Fifty bodies were recovered in previous searches, leaving 178 victims still missing. He would not comment on the condition of the bodies, calling it ""inappropriate"" to discuss. The debris is dispersed over ""quite a compact area"" of about 600 meters by 200 meters (1,960 feet by about 650 feet), he said. All the wreckage will be brought to the surface and sent to France for study, said Jean-Paul Troadec, head of the French air accident investigation agency, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses, or BEA. ""We want to know what happened in this accident, most particularly so it never happens again,"" he said. Three companies bidding to raise the wreck have until Thursday afternoon to submit proposals, he said. The operation should take three weeks to a month, and will be paid for by the French government at an estimated cost of 5 million euros ($7.1 million), he said. Authorities are not revealing the exact location of the wreck to protect the site, officials said. The head of Air France said the discovery was ""good news indeed since it gives hope that information on the causes of the accident, so far unresolved, will be found."" Air France's Pierre-Henri Gourgeon added his thanks to the French authorities ""who employed hitherto unheard of means to pursue searches."" Investigators announced Sunday that they had found pieces of the Airbus A330-200 that disappeared while flying to Paris from Rio de Janeiro. After three unsuccessful searches, investigators discovered the wreckage by using ""a different calculation based on currents of the sea and what might have happened,"" Troadec, the BEA chief, said Monday. The BEA said Sunday that a team led by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution discovered parts during an underwater search operation conducted within the previous 24 hours. Studies of the debris and bodies found after the crash led the BEA to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the agency said in a 2009 report. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed, investigators have said, though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster. The area where the plane went down is far out in the Atlantic -- two to four days for ships to reach from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. The underwater terrain is rough, with underwater mountains and valleys, the BEA has said.","NEW: Submarines spot engines, the fuselage and landing gear .

"President Barack Obama paid tribute Friday to the U.S. service members who ""defied every danger"" to pour onto the beaches of Normandy 70 years ago in defense of liberty. His remarks at the American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, which overlooks Omaha Beach where so many fell, were part of a series of solemn events to commemorate the D-Day landings in northern France. Chief among them is an elaborate international ceremony on the stretch code-named Sword Beach, in Ouistreham, for which world leaders and veterans took places in stands set up on the sand. As the ceremony got under way under brilliant sunshine, military bands marched on a map of the globe laid out across the golden strand in front of French President Francois Hollande. Hollande spoke of the bravery of the young men who waded ashore under a deluge of German fire seven decades earlier, through waters turned red with blood, hailing them all as heroes. ""I want to express my gratitude to all the fighters who are no longer here,"" Hollande said, going on to list the American, British, Canadian, Polish, Belgian and other forces that took part. He paid tribute to the many Russians who died during World War II and to the German victims of the Nazi regime. Secret D-Day training mission cost hundreds of lives . The Allied forces' sacrifice allowed Europe to live in security today, Hollande said in a speech that also highlighted the challenges the world now faces. It was followed by a dance performance depicting the occupation, liberation and post-war reconstruction of Europe. The D-Day landings, in which mainly British, U.S. and Canadian troops invaded Nazi-occupied France, were a turning point in World War II. D-Day: Exploring the myths of the Normandy landings . Obama: 'Democracy's beachhead' Obama, speaking earlier at the American Cemetery, said he was honored to be there ""to pay tribute to the men and women of a generation who defied every danger: among them, our veterans of D-Day."" Lengthy applause rang out as the U.S. President said he was humbled by the presence of some of those veterans at the ceremony. Share your family's D-Day stories . ""Here, we don't just commemorate victory, as proud of that victory as we are; we don't just honor sacrifice, as grateful as the world is; we come to remember why America and our allies gave so much for the survival of liberty at this moment of maximum peril,"" Obama said. Their story should remain ""seared into the memory of a future world,"" he said, describing Normandy as ""democracy's beachhead."" He said, ""It was here, on these shores, that the tide was turned in that common struggle for freedom. ""What more powerful manifestation of America's commitment to human freedom than the sight of wave after wave of young men boarding those boats to liberate people they'd never met?"" After the poignant ceremony, Obama and Hollande moved among the veterans and military officials, shaking hands and thanking them for their service. The cemetery, which sits on a cliff overlooking Omaha Beach and the English Channel, contains the graves of 9,387 U.S. servicemen, most of whom lost their lives in the D-Day landings. Omaha was the deadliest of the landing sites because German forces were able to fire from fortified positions on the cliffs above as the first waves of soldiers reached the shore. 70 years later, D-Day vet jumps again . Putin and Obama meet . A lunch for world leaders and veterans hosted by Hollande before the Sword Beach ceremony was the scene of an impromptu meeting between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The pair spoke on the margins of the lunch in what  Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said was an informal conversation, not a formal bilateral meeting. It lasted 10 to 15 minutes, he said. Obama and Putin have been at loggerheads in recent weeks over Russian actions in Ukraine, and the pair were not seated next to each other for lunch. The run-up to the commemorations has been dominated by the crisis in Ukraine, which has sparked the worst East-West tensions since the end of the Cold War. Putin and Ukrainian  President-elect Petro Poroshenko also talked briefly before the leaders went in to lunch in Benouville, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel standing between the two as they spoke. G7 leaders have urged Putin to engage with Poroshenko, who will be inaugurated Saturday, as Ukraine's legitimate leader and take steps to ease the pro-Russia separatist unrest roiling eastern Ukraine. Putin was excluded from a meeting of G7 leaders held this week in Brussels, Belgium, as part of measures to sanction Moscow over its annexation in March of Ukraine's Crimea region. 'Touching' commemoration . More than 156,000 troops crossed the English Channel during the D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944. Nearly 10,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded. Nicholas Soames, grandson of British wartime leader Winston Churchill, said it was ""very touching"" that so many people had come to take part in what will probably be the last commemoration of the D-Day landings on this scale, since those who survived are now in their 80s and 90s. Nearly 1,000 veterans have traveled to France to take part in the events, according to the French government. Veteran Bernard Jordan, 89, went missing from his nursing home in Hove, a town on the south coast of England, on Thursday, wearing his war medals underneath his jacket, according to CNN affiliate ITV. He was bound for the French shores once more. But the nursing home didn't know and called police, the station said. Jordan was found in France a day later marking the 70th anniversary with his friends. Another veteran called the care home to say he met Jordan on a coach to France and both men were well in a Ouistreham hotel, according to ITV News. The affiliate caught up with Jordan on his return leg, about to board a ferry home. He called the commemorations ""a first-class show."" He attended them last year. ""That was the main reason I came over here,"" he told the affiliate. ""Touch wood ... if I'm still about, I should try it the next few years as well."" When the affiliate asked whether he would be in trouble back home, he laughed: ""I might be, but I hope not."" He was then escorted away. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II is the only living head of state who served in World War II, working as a mechanic and military truck driver in the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service. 'Strength of heart' Earlier, Hollande spoke at a war memorial in the city of Caen at a ceremony to honor civilian victims and paid tribute to all those killed in the conflict. He recalled the ""strength of heart and bravery"" of those who helped to liberate France from Nazi Germany, as well as the many victims in Normandy -- more of them civilians than soldiers. Although the war may be long over in Normandy, Hollande said, ""the war is still here in this tumultuous, uncertain and sometimes threatening world -- and in all wars, it is civilians who pay a heavy price."" The Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles took part in a ceremony at the British War Cemetery in Bayeux, the largest of the Commonwealth cemeteries in France. Further along the French coast in Arromanches, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Kate, attended a tea party for veterans, and each royal spoke separately with the silver-haired and beret-attired honorees. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper was also in Normandy to honor the Canadian forces that stormed Juno Beach 70 years ago. ""It is a source of enormous national pride that Canadians played such a pivotal role in ensuring the success of the D-Day landings,"" he said in a statement. ""We are also deeply humbled by the enormous sacrifices made by our fellow citizens, who with grim determination, stood shoulder to shoulder with like-minded allies to fight evil."" A fireworks display was staged Thursday night along the Normandy coastline where the landings took place. Obama vows to stand with Ukraine as he meets President-elect .

"We leave genetic traces of ourselves wherever we go -- in a strand of hair left on the subway or in saliva on the side of a glass at a cafe. So you may want to think twice the next time you spit out your gum or drop a cigarette butt in public. New York artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg might pick it up, extract the DNA and create a 3-D face that could look like you. Her project, ""Stranger Visions,"" fashions portrait sculptures from bits of genetic material collected in public places. ""The idea for the project came from this fascination with a single hair,"" Dewey-Hagborg told CNN. ""This turned into a research project for me exploring exactly what I could discover about someone from an artifact they left behind."" As it turns out, she could discover a whole lot. Her process starts with finding a sample in a public place -- a strand of hair, a cigarette butt or a chewed piece of gum -- anything that might contain cells from a person's body. ""You want something that is relatively fresh,"" she said. ""Nothing that has been stepped on or that looks like it's been sitting around for ages."" Dewey-Hagborg takes the sample to a community biotechnology lab in Brooklyn called Genspace. There she uses a standard DNA extraction protocol to mine the DNA, purify it and use it in polymerase chain reactions. The technical process is outlined on her blog. ""From a cigarette butt, I can learn where someone's ancestors likely came from, their gender, eye color, hair color, complexion, freckles, their tendency to be overweight and a handful of dimensions of the face as well with a certain likelihood,"" she said. Once she obtains the sequencing information, she takes the traits she's gathered from the individual's DNA and feeds it into a computer program to generate a 3-D model of a face. ""The way that I use code is a lot like how a sketch artist would use a pencil,"" she said. ""I'll take the code, and then I'll generate different versions of a face. I'll use the code to enhance certain facial features or decrease them based on what I find in the DNA."" It takes about eight hours to print one of Dewey-Hagborg's faces in 3-D at NYU's Advanced Media Studio. Once it's printed in what looks like a block of powder, the face is dug out, baked and hardened with a superglue-like substance. But there are limitations. The faces are not exact replicas of the stranger who left the DNA behind. Dewey-Hagborg considers it more of a family resemblance. ""It's important to understand that these portraits are a general likeness. They're not exact reconstructions,"" she said. ""They'll have things in common with the person, but they won't look exactly like the person."" She is also unable to determine ages from the DNA samples. So all of her faces look around 30. Dewey-Hagborg started the ""Stranger Visions"" project with her own self-portrait about two years ago. ""Even though I was the one developing the code and training the system, I wasn't really sure how much it would end up looking like me,"" she said. ""I was particularly impressed with how much the overall facial shape resembled me."" Reaction to the project has been mostly positive, although some observers feel her work raises thorny ethical questions. ""This is very creepy,"" wrote a commenter on a Smithsonian blog post. ""We need to pursue our privacy post haste, if this is what is available to the public."" Dewey-Hagborg said she understands that some people could be put off by the portraits or consider them an intrusion of privacy. But that's also the point. She wants her work to raise questions about genetic surveillance and privacy issues. ""If people find it to be a little creepy, that's OK,"" she said. ""It's meant to make you aware of these issues and make you aware that this is possible."" After all, ""Stranger Visions"" is an art project. And most conceptual art produces more questions than answers. ""It's meant to be an exploration at the intersection of art and technology and science,"" she said. ""And it's meant to be a provocation.""","Heather Dewey-Hagborg extracts DNA from material and turns that into 3-D faces .

"North Korea is facing possibly its worst drought in 50 years, state media reported this week. May is on track to be the driest since 1962, with rainfall of less than a quarter of an inch (2-5 mm) recorded in major cities, including the capital, Pyongyang, the Korean Central News Agency said. The dry conditions are expected to continue into early June, North Korea's Rodong newspaper reported, citing a state weather official. Rain during the last 30 days has been lower than normal in the North, according to Jang Hyun-sik with the South Korean Meteorological Administration. ""On average, it is supposed to rain in the range of 70-90 mm (2.75 to 3.5 inches) during this period,"" Jang said, noting that South Korean forecasters do not directly communicate with their counterparts in the North. Rodong reported that the drought has delayed the planting of corn and has already damaged crops like wheat, barley and potatoes, but said irrigation ""can fight off the damage."" North Korea's food shortages are well documented.  The World Food Program says more than 6 million people in the reclusive nation don't have enough to eat. South Korean Unification Ministry's spokesman Kim Hyung-suk Seoul is open to allowing private organizations to provide humanitarian aid to the North. No food aid is likely to come from the United States.  Washington canceled its plan for food shipments after Pyongyang launched a rocket on April 13. North Korea said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing its ballistic missile technology. The move torpedoed a deal reached in February under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments.","This could be the driest May in North Korea since 1962 .

"A Spanish judge on Tuesday temporarily banned cell phone-based taxi service Uber from operating in Spain after a complaint brought by taxi drivers in the capital, Madrid. The judge issued the ban, the equivalent of a temporary injunction, on the grounds that Uber was deemed to be causing damage to the taxi industry, a court spokesman said. The hearing was in response to a complaint by the Madrid taxi association, which argued that Uber is unfair competition and also lacks the proper municipal licenses to operate a taxi service. The Madrid taxi association is expected now to file a formal lawsuit with the court, after gathering more documents and information, the court spokesman said. Legal arguments for Uber were not heard before the judge because the company is located outside of Spain, in the U.S. state of Delaware, and the taxi industry was seeking immediate relief, he said. The company is expected to have a chance to argue its points before the judge when the formal lawsuit is filed. The Madrid ruling comes on the same day that India's federal government warned states against allowing unlicensed Web-based taxi services after an Uber driver was accused of raping a woman in New Delhi. Transport authorities in New Delhi on Monday announced a ban on Uber services in the Indian capital, saying their investigation revealed the company was violating permit rules.","A judge in Madrid temporarily halts Uber operations in Spain .

"The University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia recently announced that it will no longer hire smokers. A job applicant must be tobacco-free for six months to qualify for a position there. This decision will surely prove popular. Defending the dirty habit of smoking is now left to fat cat lobbyists, highly paid lawyers with no conscience and far-right-wing crackpots. I am not in those ranks. (Full disclosure: I was a former employee of the university.) But, keeping smokers out of the hospital work force unless it protects patients makes me very nervous. Ethically, it is hard to digest. Penn is not the first health care institution to go tobacco-free in hiring. The Cleveland Clinic did so back in 2007. The Geisinger Health System in northern Pennsylvania has had such a policy complete with required nicotine testing for more than a year. Hospitals and health systems in Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, Idaho, Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas have all stopped hiring smokers. Lots of companies outside health care are not hiring smokers either, but the big push is in hospitals and health systems. So what is wrong with not hiring those who engage in (or have engaged in) a gross, sickening, bad habit? In justifying its decision, Penn says smoking and secondhand smoke contribute to 443,000 premature deaths a year and cost $193 billion in health care and lost productivity. So, clearly they want to try and make a dent in that bill by barring tobacco users. In addition, Penn notes on its website that, ""Employees who smoke cost, on average, $3,391 more a year for health care. In addition, smoke breaks during work may be disruptive and subject patients/colleagues to the unpleasant smell of smoke on employees' scrubs and clothing."" So the two big reasons are making a dent in a costly bad lifestyle choice and saving money for the health care system by hiring tobacco-free employees. I am not sure if I buy the smoke break disruption or the smelly clothes arguments. If they are problems, then send the smokers outside to a spot far away from where the patients come in and out, or have them wash their hands and faces, which everyone ought be doing anyway, and only give them the same breaks from work that everyone else gets. It comes down to a matter of fairness. Why can't the hospital work with people who may want to change their behavior but are having a hard time doing so? There's a little hypocrisy when as a place where you bring people back from sickness to health, your policy seems to reflect little concern for getting health care workers to become healthier. I don't doubt smokers cost us all a lot of money. It is also cheaper not to have to hire them and give them insurance or see them miss work. But the obese, the gamblers, rugby players, skiers, the sedentary, the promiscuous who don't practice safe sex, those who won't wear helmets on motorcycles and bikes, horseback riders, pool owners, all-terrain-vehicle operators, small-plane pilots, sunbathers, scuba divers, and surfers -- all of whom cost us money and incur higher than average health care costs -- are still on the job. Picking on the smokers alone is simply not fair. And what message does a no-smokers-are-welcome policy send? We don't want you in our health care system? Shouldn't doctors and nurses learn to work with those who sin and stray from the dictates of good health? As long as those who have bad habits are not compromising the quality of health care being provided on hospital ground, then let's not exclude smoking nurses, fat physical therapists, and scuba diving pharmacists from work. What is the best way to get a doctor or nurse who smokes to stop? Make sure they cannot get a job?  Oh yeah -- that will surely make them kick the habit! Why not hire them, tell them they have to get into anti-smoking programs and pay them a bonus when they stay smoke-free? Not hiring smokers at hospitals does send a message -- but it isn't one that hospitals and health systems ought to be sending.","The University of Pennsylvania Health System said it will no longer hire smokers .

"As I stood in the sweltering heat outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta earlier this week, President Barack Obama whispered in my ear. Okay, he didn't exactly whisper, and his words were intended not just for me. In one of the most significant addresses of his presidency, Obama declared to the world that he would send 3,000 troops to Ebola-stricken West Africa. Obama's speech was being piped into my earpiece, and I was about to go on CNN when I picked up my phone and emailed my friend Jake Tapper, the host of the show. ""World knows how to fight this disease,"" I wrote in the subject line, quoting the words I had just heard Obama speak. In the body of the email, I wrote to Jake, ""Does it?"" And that's why I took an airplane to Liberia. I want to answer my own question. The world knew how to fight Ebola outbreaks of the past, using a tried and true method I learned about in public health school: isolate sick people, trace their close contacts to see if they get sick, and if they do, isolate them and start the whole process over until the disease burns itself out. But does the world know how to stop this Ebola outbreak? Not to compare a deadly outbreak to a shampoo commercial, so please forgive me, but I think it explains the point: . If you're over 40, you might remember that old Faberge shampoo ad -- and they told two friends, and they told two friends, and so on and so on and so on, and the pictures of people replicate so by the end the screen is full of a multitude of little tiny faces who are using Faberge shampoo. That's what Ebola has become. It has spread exponentially, not linearly. There have been nearly 5,000 cases and 2,500 deaths in this outbreak -- that's more than all other outbreaks combined. What you need to know about Ebola . The U.S. response to the current Ebola outbreak is surely impressive: 3,000 troops will build 17 hospitals. They'll try to make sure medical supplies are getting in and out smoothly. A team of commissioned officers from the U.S. Public Health Service will staff a 25-bed hospital for healthcare workers who become ill. But even with these resources, do we know how to stop an outbreak that's gotten so out of hand? That's unlike any other we've ever seen? That's what I'm trying to find out, and I'll let you know what I learn. So what do you pack to cover an Ebola outbreak? Thermometers -- because at CNN it's safety first, and we have to take our temperature twice every day and report it back. Here's what else you pack: tortillas, because they don't get squished and they're slow to grow mold, and peanut butter and jelly tortillas are very handy when you don't have easy access to reliable food. Life inside the Ebola outbreak . To prepare emotionally for this trip, I hugged everyone I knew at CNN (and a few I don't know so well -- sorry). I'm a hugger, and I wanted to get my hugs out, because there are no hugs on what is in public health parlance a ""no-contact deployment."" As we boarded the plane from Brussels to Monrovia, I introduced a public health worker I'd just met to my producer, John Bonifield. As she stretched her hand out to him she said, ""This is our last handshake for this trip. No handshakes. No hugs. No kisses. And certainly no European kisses!"" Who says public health folks don't have a sense of humor? I already knew about the no-contact policy because Sophie-Jane Madden with Doctors without Borders had told me about Pierre Trbovic, a colleague of hers who was in charge of turning away people with Ebola from the hospital because there's no more beds. He was the gatekeeper, and it was his job to say no. As you might imagine, this assignment was traumatizing. When Trbovic had to turn away a woman with her baby and then watch the baby die in front of him, Madden couldn't hug him. She had to console her friend from several feet away. As I start this trip, I pray and hope for the people of West Africa, who have had to suffer so horribly. And I wonder -- if the efforts put forth now had been made even just six months ago, maybe then we truly would have known how to fight this disease.","Ebola has spread exponentially, not linearly .

"The five-minute video opens with a man cruising along in his car, cracking open a bottle of what appears to be Beck's beer and taking a swig. ""We all know drinking and driving is against the law. You're not supposed to do that. But they didn't say anything about driving and then drinking,"" the man says to the camera. ""You just have to be learned enough to understand the symbols of drunkenness."" The man, Richard Godbehere, posted the clip in February under the title ""Let's Go Driving, Drinking!"" to LiveLeak, a video-sharing site where users can vote on and donate to videos they like. Even so, he appeared surprised when police showed up at his house in Kapa'a, Hawaii, to arrest him on charges of consuming alcohol while operating a vehicle and driving without a license. ""It's unbelievable,"" Godbehere told CNN. He says the video was meant as a parody. ""There was no beer in that bottle."" Godbehere is due in court in June, and police in Kaua'i told CNN the case will come down to whether a judge or jury believes him. ""Our traffic laws are in place for a reason, and Mr. Godbehere's blatant disregard for those laws is the type of behavior that won't be tolerated,"" said Kaua'i Police Chief Darryl Perry in a statement. Social networks offer platforms for us to share everything on the Internet, from our relationship statuses to our political leanings and photos of our pets and children. But some people are discovering that what they share on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms constitutes evidence that can be used against them in a court of law. Related: When evidence of sex assault goes viral . One expert told CNN that anything posted online is material the government can use as evidence to arrest and charge a person. ""In criminal cases, almost all evidence is discoverable and police can obtain the evidence,"" said Bradley Shear, a Washington-area lawyer specializing in social media law. ""It's just a matter of what hoops they have to jump through."" The government can subpoena deleted content from social media companies, as a judge did from Twitter for a case involving an Occupy New York protester in July 2012. But sometimes, law enforcement doesn't have to jump through any hoops to collect potentially incriminating evidence -- they just have to click around online. ""It's like that old saying,"" said professor Susan Rozelle, who teaches evidence and criminal law at Stetson University College of Law in Gulfport, Florida. ""Don't put anything on your Facebook page you wouldn't tell your mother, or the local police department."" Steubenville . The most high-profile recent example of this was in Steubenville, Ohio, where social media played a role in the case of two football players who were found guilty last month of raping a drunken 16-year-old girl. The girl didn't remember much of what happened when Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, sexually assaulted her at a party in August of 2012. Her family and law enforcement learned of the assault after cell phone pictures and videos, taken by partygoers, popped up on Facebook and other sites. One key piece of evidence was an Instagram photo of the two boys carrying the girl out of a house. Mays, who shared photos of the girl naked and passed out, was also found guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor. The case caught fire on both conventional media and social media after a crime blogger and former Steubenville resident, Alexandria Goddard, uncovered some of the photos, videos and messages posted online about the incident and accused the town of giving the boys preferential treatment because they played on the football team. Police denied the claim. Just last month, two teenage girls were arrested and charged with intimidating a witness after police said they made threats against the victim on Twitter. Prosecutors have said they are considering additional charges against witnesses who refused to speak up. A grand jury will meet April 30 to hear evidence. '... to whoever's vehicle i hit i am sorry' Early on the morning of January 1 of this year, police in Astoria, Oregon, responded to a call about a hit-and-run on a residential street. There they found two cars had been sideswiped by an unknown driver, leaving behind a bumper cover and pieces of a taillight. Later that day, an officer received a private Facebook message alerting her to a Facebook status update recently posted by Astoria resident Jacob Cox-Brown, 18. It read, ""Drivin drunk... classsic ;) but to whoever's vehicle i hit i am sorry. :P"" Officers went to Cox-Brown's home and arrested him after finding a damaged vehicle missing pieces that matched those left behind at the crime scene. In an interview with ABC affiliate KATU-TV, the owner of one of the damaged vehicles said what everyone watching the case was probably thinking: ""Why would you post that? He basically just turned himself in."" Cox-Brown told KATU that his Facebook status update was ""a big joke"" and that he sideswiped the cars because of icy conditions. He is due in court April 22. Shear, the social media law expert, said he would never allow a client to post anything like that online. But he argued that Cox-Brown's post alone would not be enough for a DUI conviction. Prosecutors would need additional evidence, such as a blood-alcohol-level report, he said. ""You want to focus on charging someone with something you can prove in the court of law,"" he said. That may explain why police said Cox-Brown is charged not with driving under the influence but with two counts of ""failing to perform the duties of a driver."" The Montreal Metro Drinking Marathon . A group of young partiers in Montreal gave authorities plenty of online evidence last month after a binge-drinking journey through the city's subways. The group participated in what they called the Montreal Metro Drinking Marathon, with plans to drink a beer at every station on the 30-stop Orange line. They made it to 18 stations before losing focus, according to a post about it on Mook-life.com, a blog about youth culture in Montreal. ""I guess alcohol got the best of us and we completely forgot what was going on at one point but in my opinion that makes us all winners!"" said the March 25 post, which has since been taken down. The group also posted photos, some with blurred faces, of members chugging beers on the trains and urinating at the subway stations -- both violations of city ordinances. News sites republished some of the photos, and authorities took notice. Montreal police are now investigating the incidents and have asked for help in identifying the participants. A lawyer representing some of the partiers involved is negotiating with investigators, Montreal police said. Canada and the United States have similar protections against suspects incriminating themselves while in custody, but voluntary gloating or confessions online are free game for law enforcement, legal experts said. ""What the Fifth Amendment protects against is compulsory confessions,"" Rozelle said. ""No one compelled them to take photos of themselves drinking and peeing."" ""The problem is that people don't realize that you can't take it back,"" added Shear. ""It's almost impossible to unpost something."" When posting a photo is a crime . It's one thing to be arrested for posting a photo that shows you breaking the law. It's another to be arrested for posting a photo of someone else's handiwork. In another case of social media consequences in Montreal, a woman was arrested earlier this month after she posted a photo on Instagram of graffiti she spotted on a city wall that depicted a high-ranking Montreal police officer with a bullet hole in his head. Jennifer Pawluck, 20, was accused of criminal harassment and intimidation, according to Montreal police. ""I think the person behind the artwork should be in my place ... all I did was take a photo,"" she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Pawluck has not been formally charged but is scheduled to appear in court on May 24. A Montreal police spokesperson said there's more behind her arrest than just the posting of the photo, but declined to offer further details. Legal experts say photos and videos, whether posted publicly online or obtained in a more discreet manner by the police, have to meet the same criteria: They must be authenticated, meaning the prosecutors must prove the images are what they seem and have not been altered or staged. And they can't be shown out of context. ""You can't just show a snippet that makes it seem worse than it is,"" said Rozelle, the Stetson University law professor. When the accused admit to posting the materials themselves, authentication isn't as much of a question. But in the cases of Godbehere, in Hawaii, and Cox-Brown, in Oregon, the incriminating posts put them in the awkward position of having to disavow their own words, experts say. Either way, Rozelle says, criminals' trumpeting their crimes is nothing new. ""People have always said foolish things,"" Rozelle said, ""but now they have the ability to say it louder and to more people.""","Law enforcement can obtain virtually anything posted online and use it against a person .

"Washington (CNN)Barack Obama may be the President of the United States, but for a few minutes on Monday, he was also Stephen Colbert, outgoing host of ""The Colbert Report."" Obama sat down for an interview with Colbert in Washington -- his third appearance on the show -- and surprised the host by taking over the taping for a segment. ""You've been taking a lot of shots at my job, I've decided to take a shot at yours,"" Obama said before taking over for Colbert on ""The Word,"" a segment where Colbert (in this case, Obama) says a line or two before a witty word or phrases flashes to the right. ""How hard can this be? I am just going to say whatever you were about to say."" From there, Obama launched into a monologue about Obamacare, congressional Republicans and his last two years in office. ""Nation,"" Obama said, referring to his audience like Colbert does. ""As you know, I, Stephen Colbert, have never cared for our President. That guy is so arrogant. I bet he talks about himself in the third person."" After talking about Obamacare, the President asked, ""How do you stop something that more and more people are starting to like?"" Next to Obama flashed ""Move it to CBS,"" a nod to the fact that in two weeks Colbert will be stepping down from his Comedy Central show to take over for David Letterman at the ""The Late Show"" on CBS. The President went on to detail how Republicans could stop Obamacare. ""They could pass a bill repealing Obamacare. But the President still has the veto and if I know that guy, he is willing to use it,"" Obama said. ""And let's face it, even if Republicans somehow did repeal it, they would have to replace it with their own health care plan. Once they touch it, they own it, and then if anything goes wrong, suddenly everybody will be complaining about Mitch McConnell-care."" ""Walk It Off.gov"" then flashed next to the President. Near the close of the segment, Obama joked, noting that last year's Obamacare rollout was ""a little bumpy."" ""I think that is where Disney got the idea for Frozen,"" the President said to laughs. Obama stayed in character for the end of the segment, too. ""We will be right back with the leader of the free world,"" the President said, looking at his page like he couldn't remember his own name before adding, ""Barack Obama."" Following a break, Obama and Colbert sat down for a somewhat more traditional interview, where the President defended his decision to issue an executive action on immigration reform and the recent positive jobs report. ""The economy is growing at a faster rate than it has for years,"" Colbert said. ""Why didn't you fix the economy before the midterm elections? I would have done it before the midterms so people were happy when they voted."" ""Actually, the economy has been on a pretty good run,"" Obama said, before listing a number of economic indicators about job creation and growth that his White House regularly pushes. ""I'll give it to you. You've employed a lot of people, mostly as secretary of defense,"" Colbert said, a crack at the fact that Obama recently parted ways with his third, Chuck Hagel, and nominated his fourth, Ash Carter. On immigration, Obama said his decision to issue an executive order is ""scrupulously within the law"" and something that both Democratic and Republican presidents have done. ""You realize you are an emperor now. It has been declared,"" Colbert joked, referring to an attack some Republicans used against the President during his immigration decision. ""You are Barackus Maxamus the First."" Obama seemed to enjoy his time behind ""The Colbert Report"" desk, too. ""I will say, I felt more powerful behind that desk,"" Obama said.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's latest charm offensive with China has generated decidedly mixed reviews. Last week, he hosted a senior Chinese official whose office is responsible for banning Facebook-- along with other popular sites like YouTube and Twitter -- in China. In photos posted on China.com.cn, a government-run web portal, top Internet regulator Lu Wei is seen seated in Zuckerberg's chair at Facebook's California campus while holding a book with Chinese President Xi Jinping's portrait adorning its cover. The accompanying text explains that, when Lu found a copy of ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China"" on Zuckerberg's desk, the young billionaire told the smiling Communist Party cadre in Mandarin: . ""I also bought this book for my colleagues -- I want them to understand socialism with Chinese characteristics."" That quote has quickly gone viral online, along with a propaganda poster-style image that features Zuckerberg in a Chinese soldier's uniform clutching Xi's book to his chest. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kowtowing? Chinese internet users have reacted with as much surprise and amusement as ridicule and disapproval. Some sound sympathetic to Zuckerberg's strong desire to crack China's Internet market, the world's largest and a gaping hole in Facebook's global reach. ""He's a smart guy -- to conquer that market means to cooperate with the Chinese government and make money together,"" wrote one Twitter user. Others, however, feel betrayed by Zuckerberg's apparent kowtowing to Beijing authorities, who have built one of the world's most extensive Internet filtering and censorship systems to restrict speech and crush dissent online. ""Even if you have read all the books by Xi or (late paramount leaders) Deng Xiaoping or Mao Zedong, it's not going to help you in China,"" said another commenter. ""You're already late in the game and then there is censorship -- it would make more sense for you to work with Google to end Internet censorship."" China smitten? China's state media has been smitten with Zuckerberg since his October visit to Beijing, where he wowed students at an elite university by answering their questions in accented but fluent Mandarin. To rousing applause, the 30-year-old Internet entrepreneur said he took on the challenge of studying Mandarin to communicate with his wife's family and to better appreciate the Chinese culture. He also traded his signature hoodie-and-jeans look for a suit and tie when he met Politburo Standing Committee member Wang Qishan -- one of seven men who effectively rule the country -- at a heavily guarded leadership compound just west of Tiananmen Square. ""Wang and Lu should be Zuckerberg's sponsors for joining the Communist Party and Xi can grant his immediate approval for admission,"" tweeted Hu Jia, one of China's most prominent political dissidents, upon learning the Facebook co-founder's remarks to Lu about Xi's book. ""I once held up a sign that said 'regimes that block Facebook won't last long,'"" he added. ""Now I'm afraid Zuckerberg is making a deal or even forming an alliance with the enemy of the Internet."" For Hu and others, no Facebook at all is preferable to a Facebook with Chinese characteristics.","Mark Zuckerberg hosts China's Internet regulator at Facebook's California campus .

"(CNN) -- After a multi-year odyssey marked by almost nonstop partisan bickering, CIA employees hacking into Senate Intelligence Committee computers, and former Bush administration officials launching a pre-emptive public counterattack against the committee's report, we finally have a summary of the CIA's use of torture. So what have we learned? The committee report confirms that six days after the 9/11 attacks, ""President George W. Bush signed a covert action Memorandum of Notification (MON) to authorize the director of central intelligence (DCI) to 'undertake operations designed to capture and detain persons who pose a continuing, serious threat of violence or death to U.S. persons and interest or who are planning terrorist activities.'"" That decision put the CIA on the path to revive and even expand coercive interrogation techniques it had employed during the Cold War. Some key facts we already knew were confirmed, most importantly that agency personnel violated U.S. and international law by repeatedly waterboarding several detainees, including 9/11 attack mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The summary of the report provides lurid details of ""24""-like interrogation techniques, outlawed by international treaties to which the U.S. is a signatory: running power drills next to the heads of detainees, days of forced sleep deprivation and, in the words of the committee summary, ""threats to harm the children of a detainee, threats to sexually abuse the mother of a detainee, and a threat to 'cut (a detainee's) mother's throat.'"" The committee report summary also confirms what many have long believed -- that the torture program produced no actionable intelligence and did not to thwart al Qaeda's global activities. The former chief of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center and torture program participant Jose Rodriguez continues to claim that such intelligence was obtained, and that it did in fact save lives. The available record, as laid out by the committee, amply refutes that assertion. And the committee summary could not be clearer about the actions of agency managers and attorneys in the expansion of the use of techniques that were clear violations of international law. According to the committee summary: . "" ... by the end of November 2001, CIA officers had begun researching potential legal defenses for using interrogation techniques that were considered torture by foreign governments and a non-governmental organization."" CIA Director George Tenet subsequently sent a letter to Bush urging that the CIA program be exempt from Geneva Convention prohibitions on the use of techniques defined by international law as torture. Whether as federal employees or political appointees, CIA personnel took an oath to uphold the laws of the United States. Instead, they chose to engage in acts that clearly violated those laws, including international treaties banning the use of torture to which the United States is not only a signatory, but a putative leader as well. The response of multiple former intelligence community insiders who authorized or supported these programs is perfectly summed up in this quote from an anonymous former official offered to the Daily Beast earlier this week: . ""It goes back to the one basic thing: Whether they did right or they did wrong, they were told to do something, they did it, and they feel like they had the rug pulled out from underneath them."" Indeed, those CIA attorneys and managers who signed off on waterboarding and other tactics had an affirmative obligation to refuse to authorize, much less participate in, a torture program. Now, through de facto surrogates appearing on major media outlets and operating a website attempting to rewrite the history of this dark era, participants in the torture program claim they are the victims for simply following orders. The defense of ""I was just following orders"" is never a winning one. The use of mass surveillance and torture are the hallmarks of totalitarian governments. The United States has employed both since the September 11, 2001, attacks on our nation. While we have yet to renounce the former, the release of this Senate Intelligence Committee torture report summary is a long-overdue first step in renouncing the latter. Let's hope it's not the last step.","Senate Intelligence Committee releases report on CIA torture .

"The Senate Republican's most senior member is ready to support President Barack Obama's attorney general nominee, U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch. Orrin Hatch, a high-ranking member of the upper chamber's judiciary committee, spoke to reporters Tuesday on Capitol Hill about Lynch's credentials and Republican's desire to see Eric Holder, the current attorney general, leave office. ""She appears to be a very top-flight person,"" he said. ""And if conservatives do want to get rid of the attorney general, this is a good option because she would replace him and do a very a good job."" Holder is one of the more controversial members of the Obama cabinet. Seen as overly partisan by Republicans, the House voted to hold him in contempt of Congress in 2012 for refusing to turn over documents linked to Operation Fast and Furious. The announcement of his resignation in September was welcome by those opponents. Lynch, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, was nominated by Obama last month to replace Holder, who has served as head of the Justice Department since the beginning of the Obama administration. She's easily passed through the Senate twice for her nominations as a federal prosecutor. ""I can think of no better public servant to be our next attorney general,"" the President said when he nominated Lynch. ""It's my hope that the Senate will confirm her for a third time without delay."" At 55 years old, she will be the first African-American woman to serve as attorney general if confirmed. Hatch's support is critical to get through the judiciary committee and the entire Senate, both of which will be controlled by Republicans when Congress resumes next year. He did note that he hasn't met with the nominee yet. ""I guess I'm not important enough,"" Hatch, who has chaired the committee multiple times over the past 20 years, joked. Unconcerned she hasn't come by yet, he expects to meet with her before her nomination hearings as traditionally done with most committee members. ""I'm somebody who wants to support the President on these matters,"" Hatch said. ""I think probably she feels like she's had a lot of people she needs to meet with right off the bat. And that's fine with me."" The senior Republican from Utah has a history of supporting Presidents' judicial nominees of both parties. He voted for both Democratic Presidents Clinton and Obama's attorneys general, Janet Reno and Eric Holder. His support for Holder, though, has waned. ""I happen to think the attorney general has not done a great job, but I like him personally a lot,"" Hatch said. Presented with the new option, he noted in his amicable, and perhaps slightly eager, tone that Lynch's nomination ""looks pretty good to me.""","GOP Sen.

"(CNN) -- Carolina Panthers star quarterback Cam Newton has two fractures in his back after a two-vehicle wreck Tuesday, the NFL team said in a statement. He is in fair condition, undergoing tests and will remain in the hospital overnight, the team said. The injury was to Newton's transverse process, a small bone that extends from each vertebra in the back. There were no other internal injuries, the team said. It would be a surprise if he could play Sunday but not out of the question, said Dr. Kenneth Mautner, director of primary care sports medicine at Emory University in Atlanta. ""It's not the kind of injury that affects the spine or the nerves so it's a matter of when the pain settles down enough so he can play,"" said Mautner, who is not involved in Newton's case. Newton was taken to a hospital after the truck he was traveling in crashed in Charlotte, North Carolina, said Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department spokesman Rob Tufano. Newton's truck and a sedan were involved in the wreck. ""It would appear (Newton's vehicle) rolled over. The accident is being investigated,"" he said. There was no word on what caused the wreck in uptown Charlotte, a block from Bank of America Stadium, where the Panthers play, but witnesses told CNN affiliate WSOC they saw Newton's vehicle flip four times. WSOC published an image of a dark-colored truck lying on its side in the roadway. A car with damage to its front end was loaded onto a flatbed, CNN affiliate WBTV reported, and Tufano told the station that the driver of the other vehicle was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The Charlotte Observer tweeted an image of Newton lying on his side smiling. WBTV reported that Newton was placed on a stretcher and loaded onto an ambulance after the crash, which occurred around 12:30 p.m. A Charlotte police source told the station Newton was not injured and was taken to the hospital only as a precaution. The Carolina Panthers tweeted, ""We are closely monitoring the situation of a car wreck involving Cam Newton. We will have more information at an appropriate time."" Mautner said the injury is treated similar to a rib injury and Newton likely will wear extra padding during a game to protect the back. He said Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo had the same injury. Mautner said doctors will advise rest and recuperation and likely will recommend Newton not practice for at least two days, perhaps longer. It can take one to three weeks to for a patient to deal with fractures, Mautner said. Newton shot to fame in 2010, leading the Auburn Tigers to an undefeated national championship season. He went on to win the Heisman Trophy, given to the best player in college football, and was drafted No. 1 by the Panthers in 2011, making him the first player to accomplish all three feats in the same year. After signing a four-year, $22 million deal with the Panthers in 2011, the Atlanta native showed his prowess as both a passer and a rusher, racking up more than 4,000 yards throwing and more than 700 yards running, snaring Rookie of the Year honors. This year, with both Newton and his team beset by injuries, he has put up less impressive numbers, and the Panthers are 4-8-1 going into this weekend's games. He arguably had his best game of the season Sunday against the division rival New Orleans Saints, throwing three touchdown passes and rushing for another. Despite their dismal record, the Panthers are still in the playoff hunt because of the weak competition in the NFC South.

"(CNN) -- Trayvon Martin. Michael Brown. Eric Garner. The list of names of black men killed by white men who have subsequently gone unpunished -- and in the case of Brown and Garner, untried -- continues to grow. In each of these cases, an ugly theme has been raised in defense of the perpetrators: The victims should have known better. Why did Garner resist arrest? Why was Martin wearing a hoodie? Why did Brown not meekly get out of the street when ordered to by a police officer? The reasoning goes that their deaths were triggered by their deeds; they need to be held posthumously accountable for their conduct. When it comes to the actions of their white killers, however, the accountability hawks fall suddenly silent. In their eyes, accountability is apparently only for the dark-skinned (for being ""uppity"" or vulgar), the poor (for failing to bootstrap themselves into success), the recently immigrated (for failing to ""mainstream"" into American society) -- and, as we've also seen, for women for failing to avoid sexual predators and LGBTs for being too blatant about their sexuality. A flagrant new example of this ""accountability for thee, but not for me"" sensibility emerged last week, when New England Cable News reported that actor Mark Wahlberg -- one of Hollywood's most bankable leading men, who scored a staggering $16 million paycheck for his turn as a heroic father and inventor in the most recent ""Transformers"" movie -- has petitioned Massachusetts for pardon of his brutal assaults on a pair of Vietnamese men, Tranh Lam and Hoa Trinh, while a teenager in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The attacks were peppered with racial slurs; he called Lam a ""Vietnam f*cking sh*t"" before smashing him in the head with a large club and knocking him unconscious, and he punched Trinh so hard that he left him blinded in one eye. He repeatedly referred to both men as ""slant-eyed gooks"" while he was being arrested. Wahlberg, who was 17, was tried as an adult and served 45 days in jail for the crime. In the application he filed to the state's Advisory Board of Pardons, Wahlberg states that he has ""dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others"" and that ""receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that I am not the same person that I was."" He claims that, despite his use of racist language, the race of the men was not a motivation for his crime, blaming instead the ""influence of alcohol and narcotics."" (Wahlberg committed the assaults while seeking to steal two cases of beer from Lam's convenience store.) In a stroke of irony, he states that a major reason for seeking a pardon is the desire to expand his own burgeoning restaurant chain, Wahlburgers, whose licensing has been hampered by his record as a felon. So, young Mark Wahlberg, who would just half a decade later rise to fame as a rapper and a crotch-grabbing underwear model under the name ""Marky Mark"" before successfully transitioning to acting, was let off with a trivial 45-day sentence after battering an Asian man until he was permanently handicapped. Three gold records, $200 million in wealth and untold fame and adulation later, he's seeking absolution for his crimes, because, he writes, ""troubled youths will see this as an inspiration and motivation that they, too, can turn their lives around."" The unwritten phrase that should follow Wahlberg's assertion: ""That is to say, so long as they're white and their victims are not."" If a black, Hispanic or Asian youth under the influence of drugs and alcohol had put out a white man's eye while trying to rob his store, it's inconceivable that he would have been let off with such a light sentence; implausible that he'd have gone on to the kind of marquee stardom that Wahlberg has obtained; unlikely that he would have the sense of unvarnished privilege that is driving Wahlberg's desire for a whitewashing of his record, if you'll pardon the pun. According to The Boston Globe, to this day Wahlberg has never apologized or paid restitution to the victims of his crimes. He also hasn't really acknowledged his pattern of bigoted language and racist violence, which included a separate episode in which he threw rocks at African-American schoolchildren while shouting that ""black n*ggers"" were unwelcome in his community. And he has never reached out to the Vietnamese-American community or other communities of color with the kind of targeted charity and philanthropic presence befitting someone who was truly remorseful for the repulsive actions of his youth. And that's the most gut-wrenching aspect of Wahlberg's request, coming as it does in the wake of the repeated, unpunished killings of young black men and teens at the hands of white men. The darkest reactions to the deaths of Martin, Brown and Garner described the victims as hardened, bestial and irredeemably corrupted by casual drug use or records of petty crime. They were, in the coded language of these commenters, ""thugs."" Meanwhile, Wahlberg, a wealthy white man with a more extensive criminal record than any of the black men mentioned above, has been described across mainstream media as a ""troubled"" youth who's since made good. In the wake of the grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo for the choking death of Garner, the hashtag #CrimingWhileWhite trended on Twitter, featuring hundreds of white people sharing how their infractions were dismissed by police, while in many cases black friends were prosecuted for the same offenses. I noted at the time that the hashtag was ""proof that there are two America: One that gets off with a wink. And one that just gets offed."" In that other America, white versions of Martin, Brown and Garner might well have gotten the chance to ""make good"" like Wahlberg; they might be the ones seeking to redeem their youthful indiscretions. Sadly, no amount of pardoning will resurrect the dead.","Mark Wahlberg petitioned Massachusetts for pardon of his brutal assaults of two men .

"ALS has no survivors.  Zero. The disease is an incurable -- let's change that -- progressive degenerative neurological disorder.  For reasons that are still not completely understood, the nerve cells in my brain and spinal cord will gradually deteriorate. I will ultimately lose the ability to move, speak, swallow and finally breathe.  ALS leads to complete paralysis.  The average life expectancy is two to five years.  Shit. This is not fun to talk about! I have what is called familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Only 5% to 10% of ALS patients have this genetic disposition.  My grandmother Marie was diagnosed when I was in middle school.  She passed away six years later.  My mother, Catherine, was diagnosed when I was in high school and has been living with this disease for 13 years.  Although most of my mom's muscles have atrophied away, she's the longest living ALS patient in her clinic.  She is the most beautiful and inspirational person you will ever meet. Four years ago, I graduated from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles and moved back home to help care for my mom.  I started a wedding photography business.  I photographed weddings on the weekends and would help my mom during the weekdays while my stepfather was at work.  I was fulfilling two passions:  photographing 40+ weddings a year and spending much needed quality time with my mom.  I loved it! But then my hands, arms and shoulders started getting weak.  I was carrying camera equipment all day, and it became increasingly more difficult to change settings and hold up my camera.  After a wedding, I felt like I was hit by a bus.  I was so incredibly exhausted, and it took my body a long time to recuperate.  I thought I was just overdoing it, but realized I couldn't ignore the symptoms anymore. On January 27, 2014, at 26 years old, I was diagnosed with ALS. That day, hands down, was the most difficult day of my entire life.  I cried uncontrollably in the doctor's office.  When I saw family in the waiting room, I just remember repeating the phrase, ""it's not fair"" as my sister Vanessa hugged me without saying a word. Somehow, I summed up the courage to tell my mom the same day.  Words can't describe the level of emotional pain she went through.  I really hate thinking about it. The next day, I canceled 30 weddings I had booked for that year as a photographer.  I sold all of my camera gear to refund the deposits.  Since then I've lost the ability to button my clothes and open bottles.  I feel like I have weights strapped to my body.  Taking a shower is a workout in itself. It sucks, but I try to be grateful for the abilities I haven't lost yet.  The muscles in my upper body are constantly twitching and cramping.  It's a constant annoying reminder that my body is breaking down. I believe this is one of the reasons many people didn't really know what ALS was all about before the ice bucket challenge:  No one wanted to talk about a depressing disease with no cure, no hope.  My family included.  We rarely discussed the lack of support surrounding this disease because it brought too much heartache.  ""Be strong and positive for the family"" is what I think most of us had in the back of our minds. But now ALS is finally out of the closet after the ice bucket challenge sensation this summer!  Wahoo!  If there's one thing I've learned from my recent experiences is that we have to share our story, even if it's difficult.  How else can we rally the support we so desperately need?  One voice can and will make a difference. The challenge sparked hope, raised awareness and made a huge impact on launching new research initiatives, but we still need funds to find a cure. My family, including my new wife, Laarne, and I have a sense of empowerment that we've never had before.  Priceless.  My quality of life is amazing right now, but it's so great that I don't want it to stop.  It's bittersweet.  I'm grateful I've found the love of my life. I just want to spend as much time as I can with her. Let's change the course of ALS.  We're stronger together.  Please join me in this fight, and I'd be so incredibly grateful.","Anthony Carbajal was diagnosed with ALS at 26 years old .

"Washington (CNN)Reince Priebus says he has the votes to win another term as chairman of the Republican National Committee, an organization he successfully rebuilt following the 2010 midterm elections. Priebus told RNC members of his plan to seek a third term in an email Monday night and said that 150 of the 168 party officials and political activists who make up the national organization have pledged to support him, according to a copy of the note obtained by CNN. ""With such support it is impossible for me to say no,"" Priebus wrote. ""Therefore, I write to seek your support for another term as RNC chairman. As some of you may have heard me say, thus far we accomplished about 80 percent of what we needed to accomplish with another 80 percent left to go. If we are going to win in 2016, we must build upon what we were able to accomplish over the last 4 years, and I ask for your continued support to make sure we do in fact accomplish that goal."" When Priebus took over the RNC, it was $25 million in debt, which he helped to erase by convincing deep-pocketed Republican donors to start contributing again to the committee after the controversial chairmanship of Michael Steele. After the 2012 election, Priebus focused the RNC's efforts on upgrading the committee's technological infrastructure and voter data as well as outreach to minority communities. He commissioned a report, the ""Growth and Opportunity Project,"" that outlined ways for the GOP to grow its base. Republicans largely embraced the report, but social conservatives opposed a recommendation the party be more tolerant of people who are gay. At this time, Priebus has no opponent in the race to lead the national party. Assuming he wins election to a third term at the RNC Winter Meeting in January, Priebus will be on track to be the longest-serving chairman in committee history.","Reince Priebus says he's running for a third term as Republican National Committee chairman .

"(CNN) -- A Wisconsin judge ruled there is enough evidence for four women to stand trial for their roles in a staged motel tryst that ended with a man tied to a bed, his penis super-glued to his stomach, a lawyer for one of the women said Wednesday. Michelle Belliveau, Wendy Sewell, Therese Ziemann and the man's wife appeared in court Tuesday. A Calumet County Circuit Court Judge issued the ruling Tuesday after hearing from the alleged victim, who spent about 90 minutes on the witness stand describing his ordeal, attorney Rob Bellin said. The 37-year-old man, who is in custody on charges in an unrelated case, delivered his testimony wearing an orange jailhouse jumpsuit. ""I was telling them they couldn't do this, that it's assault. Hello, let me leave,"" the alleged victim said, according to CNN affiliate WBAY. The man's wife and two of his girlfriends hatched a plot to lure him to a Stockbridge motel on July 30 and confront him after learning that he was having ""sexual relations"" with all of them, a criminal complaint states. Therese Ziemann, Wendy Sewell, Michelle Belliveau and the man's wife are accused of felony false imprisonment, which carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison. Ziemann, who is also accused of misdemeanor sexual assault and battery, faces arraignment on October 5. Belliveau pleaded not guilty on Tuesday, and the others have motion hearings scheduled in October. CNN does not name victims of alleged sexual assault and will not name the alleged victim's wife since they use the same last name. Ziemann told investigators that her lover's wife contacted her the day before the incident and revealed that he was married with children and seeing other women for money. Ziemann said she confirmed the information with Sewell, and the three arranged to confront him ""without him knowing,"" the complaint says. Belliveau, Ziemann's sister, was allegedly also present. The man went to the hotel on July 30 to meet Ziemann, who told investigators that she met him on Craigslist and fell in love, paying for their hotel rooms and lending him $3,000, the complaint says. The alleged victim told police that when he arrived, Ziemann told him she wanted to ""tie him up and give him a rub down."" She used bed sheets to tie him to the bed, and blindfolded him with a pillowcase before cutting off his underwear with scissors, according to the complaint. She then texted the other women to let them know ""he's tied up."" After they arrived, they peppered him with questions like, ""which do you love more?"" and ""who do you want to grow old with?"" Ziemann told police she slapped her lover and asked ""can you handle that?"" before using Krazy Glue to stick his penis to his stomach. The man told police that the women took his wallet, cell phone and car and left him tied to the bed. He chewed on the bindings to free himself and eventually called police. The man, who has a criminal record in Wisconsin dating back to 1998, is in custody on unrelated charges of child abuse, theft and harassment. His next court appearance in that case is scheduled for Thursday, September 17.","Wisconsin judge rules there is sufficient evidence for women to stand trial .

"Rapper Gucci Mane is headed to prison. He was sentenced Wednesday to three years and three months in federal prison on firearm charges. The 34-year-old, whose real name is Radric Davis, pleaded guilty in May to a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon after reaching an agreement with prosecutors. ""Davis has a long history of violence and illegally possessing and using guns,"" U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said in a statement. Davis' prison sentence will be followed by three years of supervised release. He was ordered to pay a restitution of $5,000 and give up all firearms listed in the indictment. As part of the plea deal and the court's sentence, Davis will also seek mental health treatment once he is released from prison. In the news release, Atlanta Police Chief George Turner stated, ""I hope this sentence sends a strong message that we simply will not tolerate this type of irresponsible, criminal behavior from anyone, regardless of who they are."" The Atlanta Police Department responded to a call on September 14 from an acquaintance of Davis, who told police that the rapper was acting violently and had a handgun. Police arrived to find Davis smelling strongly of marijuana, waving a loaded Glock .40-caliber handgun, and making threatening comments. Two days prior, police had been called to a different location in DeKalb County, where Davis was in possession of a different firearm, making threatening comments. According to Billboard, Davis' lawyers stated in court that the rapper struggled with addiction to a mixture of cough syrup and soda known as lean and asked that he be sent to a facility with a recovery program and that he would prefer serve his time on the West Coast, away from distractions closer to home. Davis has had numerous brushes with the law. In 2012, the rapper was arrested, accused of hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at an Atlanta nightclub. Before that incident, Davis was arrested and accused of violating a number of traffic laws in Atlanta, but the charges were dismissed. In 2005, Davis was charged with murder in the shooting death of a man, but charges were dropped because of insufficient evidence. Jackie Chan's son held in anti-drugs crackdown in China's capital .

By the time she was 15 years old, Malala had already become an outspoken activist for girls' right to education. But the Taliban, who were trying to push girls out of classrooms, had a formidable grip on northwestern Pakistan's Swat Valley. On October 9, 2012, Taliban gunmen tracked down her school bus. They asked where Malala was. Her classmates, under threat, pointed her out. Malala was shot in the head. She was hospitalized in critical condition, unresponsive for three days. Eventually, doctors put Malala in a medically induced coma so an air ambulance could fly her from Pakistan to Britain for treatment. She recovered and continued her activism for girls' right to education -- despite more death threats from the Taliban. ""They can only shoot my body,"" Malala told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""They cannot shoot my dreams."" While she hasn't returned to Pakistan since her shooting, Malala has doubled down on her efforts to improve education for girls around the world, including writing a memoir and making highly publicized trips to Syria and Nigeria. Malala has said she wants the prime ministers of Pakistan and India to attend the ceremony Wednesday where she and Satyarthi will receive their awards. Peace between the two countries, Yousafzai said, is important for their progress. She said awarding the Peace Prize to a Pakistani Muslim and an Indian Hindu ""gives a message to people of love between Pakistan and India, and between different religions."" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Malala Yousafzai's uniform is part of an exhibit at the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo, Norway .

"(CNN) -- If there's attention to be had, you better believe the Kardashians know how to grab it. On Tuesday night, Instagram was on fire thanks to two posts made by Kim and Khloe Kardashian. One of the images, posted by Khloe, made a joke about the Ku Klux Klan that has unleashed a wave of criticism. And then, just a few hours after Khloe posted (and deleted) the inflammatory photo, Kim decided to unleash her naked, oiled butt onto the world. We're not joking. The 34-year-old posed for the winter issue of Paper magazine, which has the express goal of ""breaking the Internet."" (In that case, Paper can consider its mission accomplished.) The publication chose photographer Jean-Paul Goude to do the honors, asking the artist to recreate his ""Champagne Incident"" photograph. The result is one cover in which Kim poses in a floor-length gown, balancing a glass of champagne on her rear, while the other cover puts the reality star's best known asset front and center in all its glistening glory. If you're curious, husband Kanye West approves. ""And they say I didn't have a talent,"" Kardashian tweeted after sharing the photos. ""Try balancing a champagne glass on your a** LOL."" That doesn't sound easy, but we'd say the Kardashians also have a clear talent for provocation. Before Kim set out to #BreakTheInternet, her younger sister was on the verge of doing so as well. Khloe, 30, posted a picture on Instagram of herself with her sisters Kim and Kourtney that was captioned: ""the only KKK to ever let black men in."" It isn't clear where the image originated, but Khloe shared that along with her own comment, calling the statement ""True."" (Khloe was married to an African-American basketball player, Lamar Odom, and Kim has dated a number of famous African-American men, from singer Ray J to athlete Reggie Bush.) The post has since been removed, but the controversy hasn't been erased as easily. Khloe hasn't explicitly commented on the reaction, but some believe one of her recent Instagram posts is an attempt at an apology. ""We're all equally f****d up,"" says the photo in the post, which was shared Tuesday. ""Some only hide it better."" Over on his own Instagram account, Kourtney Kardashian's partner, Scott Disick, chimed in with his spin on the statement. Posting the same photo, he added one amendment to the image's text: ""the only KKK to ever let black men in. ... and a Jew.""","Kim Kardashian shows her rear view on the cover of Paper magazine .

"Ralph Baer, the inventor of the first home video game console, has died. He was 92. His family confirmed the death, at his home in Manchester, New Hampshire, to the New York Times. Baer was an engineer with a defense contractor in 1966 when he began toying with the concept of playing games on a television. The German native, whose Jewish family moved to the United States before World War II, patented several video game prototypes. The ""Brown Box"" would go on to become the Magnavox Odyssey, the first commercially available home gaming system. The Odyssey was released in 1972 and ran a tennis game that predated, but was similar to Atari's Pong. According to the Times, Baer was waiting for a friend at a bus terminal in New York City when an idea gripped him and he began scribbling on a note pad. The idea was a ""game box"" that would let people to play board, action, sports and other games on most television sets. A boss at his job gave him $2,500 and two staffers to pursue the idea. Baer and his employer, Sanders Associates, would file for the first video-game patent in 1971. While his console launched what would become a multi-billion-dollar industry, his single most popular product was actually ""Simon,"" the memory game that was released in 1978. Simon, with four colored buttons with corresponding audio tones, became an instant best-seller. Versions of it are sold to this day. By the time of his death, Baer had  more than 150 patents. He was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 2006, the same year he donated all of his prototypes and related documents to the Smithsonian Institute. Baer is survived by two sons and a daughter and four grandchildren. His wife, Dena, died in 2006.","Ralph Baer invented the first gaming console in 1966.

"For many women, a Carrie Bradshaw closet would be a dream come true. But without one, dressing for a special occasion can be a girl's nightmare. Smart Business meets Abby and Shan Shan, co-founders of Hong Kong company Yeechoo, who are hoping to solve the age old dilemma of having nothing to wear. CNN: What was the idea behind starting Yeechoo.com? Abby: You know us girls, we are always facing the issue that we have a whole closet of clothes, of dresses, but that we still don't know what to wear. With Yeechoo, this is like your best friend's closet - you dont have to spend thousands of dollars to buy a dress you're only going to wear once or twice. CNN: Yeechoo functions as a shared closet focusing on variety over ownership. How does that work? Shan Shan: What we found is a girl would only wear a dress maximum of five to six times, and on average only twice or three times before they get forgotten. That's why we think the cost per wear is just too high to justify the high price tag for the designer dresses. We always say you can spend $10,000 on one dress, or $10,000 for ten different dresses. CNN: How do you keep up with the variety of women's sartorial tastes worldwide? S:  We always need to expand our styles that fit different bodies because all the girls have different tastes and different needs. CNN: Which markets have been the most receptive to Yeechoo? A: Asia's not very into second hand clothing, it's unlike US or Europe. People are very conservative, and they'd rather chose fast fashion over secondhand clothing, so the challenge is to educate our customers, too. CNN: What kind of effect do you hope the company will have on the fashion industry? A: At the moment, only a very small fraction of people can have access to a luxury good, to designer brands, because of their high price. But Yeechoo made a change, and has made a disruptive entry here. we are democratizing the fashion industry, and making it accessible to the mass market.","In Hong Kong, fashion rental site Yeechoo hopes to transform how we approach evening wear .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The military will phase out its ""stop-loss"" program, the contentious practice of holding troops beyond the end of their enlistments, for all but extraordinary situations, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced Wednesday. Robert Gates said the Pentagon will pay a $500-per-month bonus to troops whose tours have been extended. Gates also announced at a wide-ranging news conference that the Defense Department will pay for families of fallen troops to travel to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present for the return of their deceased family members. The decision to phase out stop loss by 2011 comes in combination with an announcement that soldiers affected by the program will receive a $500-a-month bonus while they are in extended service. Currently, the Army is the only service that uses the stop-loss program. As of January, 13,217 soldiers had tours extended under the stop-loss policy. Gates said the change is one he has wanted to implement since he became secretary of defense. ""While these changes do carry some risk, I believe it is important that we do everything possible to see that soldiers are not unnecessarily forced to stay in the Army beyond their end-of-term-of-service date,"" Gates said. The stop-loss program was put in place to ensure units remained intact during deployment. For those whose enlistment was due to end, tours of duty could be extended in the middle of their unit's deployment. The Army used the stop-loss policy during Operation Desert Shield in 1990 and reinstated it after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Gates cited two factors as contributing to the end of the program. First, he said, ""We will be drawing down in Iraq, over the next 18 or 19 months, significantly more than we are building up in Afghanistan, in terms of the Army."" In addition, the Army has more troops to call on. Retention and enlistment are up, Gates said, and the service has reached its goal of 547,000 personnel sooner than expected. The defense secretary would not talk about details of the White House's review of Afghanistan strategy, being conducted by the Defense Department, State Department and the White House, but he did said it has not been easy coming up with a promising new strategy. ""It's a difficult problem and trying to come up with new approaches and new initiatives that enhance our prospects for success is hard work,"" he explained. He admitted that he has been ""uncertain"" about the proper direction for the Afghanistan strategy. ""I've been very concerned about an open-ended commitment of increasing numbers of troops for a variety of reasons, including the size of our footprint in Afghanistan, and my worry that the Afghans come to see us as not their partners and allies, but as part of their problem,"" Gates told reporters. Gates defended the continued hunt for Osama bin Laden, and suggested the expectation that bin Laden could be easily found is unrealistic. ""I think too many people go to too many movies. Finding these guys is really hard, especially if they have some kind of a support network,"" Gates said. ""We have, I think, done some serious damage to al Qaeda over the last number of months. And everybody continues to look for number one and number two."" Gates also announced he is recommending to the president that he renominate Adm. Michael G. Mullen for a second term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Gen. James Cartwright as vice chairman. The announcement about funding the trips to Dover comes as the Pentagon prepares to allow the media to record the return of fallen troops from overseas, if the families of the troops permit it. The media has been prevented from doing so since 1989. ""We are committed to seeing that America's fallen heroes are received back to their loved ones and their country with the honor, respect and recognition that they and their families have earned,"" Gates said. He briefly talked about his own trip to Dover earlier this week, getting emotional as he described going to the back of the plane carrying the coffins. ""I went to the back of the plane by myself and spent time with each of the transfer cases,"" he said, his voice beginning to choke up. ""I think I'll stop there.""","NEW: Robert Gates says families of fallen soldiers will get travel aid to Dover AFB .

"Machu Picchu. It's on most everybody's bucket list, and for good reasons. It is one of the most transcendentally beautiful spots on earth. But how do you get to the Peruvian Andes, and what do you do to make the trip easy, comfortable and meaningful? It's not the attitude, but the altitude . Cuzco, the gateway to Machu Picchu, is more than 11,000 feet above sea level, a height that can cause altitude sickness, especially for travelers coming from low elevations. Machu Picchu is at 7,874 feet, so the best plan to mitigate altitude sickness is to arrive at Cuzco in the morning (the first flight from Lima departs at 6 a.m.) and then immediately grab the first train down to Machu Picchu. Enjoy Cuzco on the back end after acclimatization. How do you get there? Several airlines have direct service from U.S. gateways to Lima, and from there it is an hour flight to Cuzco, the ancient Inca capital. LAN Airlines has the most direct routing as it serves several major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Miami, with a seamless link to Cuzco. Once in Cuzco the choices are generally foot or train down to Machu Picchu. The Inca Trail is a five-day trek over some high passes. It is a spectacular way to enter the citadel of Machu Picchu, but it requires a measure of fitness. It is easy to take several types of trains the 70 miles from Cuzco to Aguas Calientes, the town at the base of the Lost City. The most deluxe train experience is the one-car Incan Princess. Once at Aguas Calientes it is a bus ride up a steep, severe chevron of a road to the Sacred City of the Inca. The government now limits the number of visitors to 5,000 a day, so it's best to get your ticket in advance, as some folks have been turned away at the entrance gate after making the long trip. You can make your own arrangements or book through a number of veteran outfitters such as Mountain Travel Sobek. They will arrange all tickets, transfers, transport, accommodations and guides. When is the best time to see Machu Picchu? Machu Picchu is open year-round, but October to April is the rainy season, and therefore it has the fewest visitors. The inconvenience of rain is offset by the lack to tourists, and it is worth considering. Avoid holidays if you can, as Machu Picchu and everything surrounding it is packed. Once at Aguas Calientes (hotel tip: check in at The Inkaterra), to avoid the crowds and witness one of the most spectacular sunrises in the world, take the first bus from Aguas Calientes, which leaves at 5:30 a.m. It's worth it. Hints for inside the citadel . There are no bathrooms, restaurants or drinking water once you enter the site, but there are facilities just before the entrance. So hold onto your entrance ticket so you can exit and re-enter. Pack sunscreen, a sun hat and water. Weather in the Andes can also change in an instant, so you should also pack a rain jacket. Sturdy shoes are a must. If you are in reasonable shape, sign up to climb Huayna Picchu, the famous peak within the ruins that appears in most photos. They only allow 400 a day to climb, so sign up the day before and go early for best views. What else can you do in the area? If you have time, sign up for the day raft trip on the Urubamba through the Sacred Valley of the Incas -- one of the most spectacular float trips in the world. And, of course, plan on spending at least two days in Cuzco, a unique blend of European and Inca sensibilities with superb restaurants, hotels and accessible ruins. And try to make a stop at the nearby Pisac market, one of the most colorful bazaars in the world. Most people visit Pisac on Sunday, the main market day, but there are smaller markets on Tuesday and Thursday. Finally, consider extending your trip to other wonders of South America, including the Galapagos, Easter Island and Iguazu, all of which are served by LAN Airlines, with Lima as the hub. What makes Machu Picchu so special? There is a harmony of elements here, the man-made and the natural. It is a stunning integration of architecture, setting, function, space and form. The Inca knew something we seek: When order combines with complexity, when elegance appears effortless and when there is a coherent but unspoken relationship among the parts, then there is enduring beauty. Richard Bangs is the producer for the upcoming public television special, ""South America: Quest for Wonder.""","Going directly to Machu Picchu may help alleviate altitude sickness .

"The suspected leader of Mexico's New Juarez Cartel has been arrested, the state-run Notimex news agency reported Sunday, the latest in a series of high-profile drug arrests. Alberto Carrillo Fuentes, aka ""Ugly Betty,"" was captured in the western state of Nayarit, Notimex said. The report did not describe the circumstances of his arrest, nor did it say when it happened. Last month, Mexican authorities arrested Mario Armando Ramirez Trevino, a suspected leader of the country's Gulf Cartel. Los Zetas known for 'complete absence of scruples,' expert says . They nabbed Zetas leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, one of Mexico's most wanted drug lords, in July -- marking the most significant blow to drug trafficking in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December. Notimex reported that Carrillo Fuentes is the brother of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who died in 1997 as a result of undergoing plastic surgery to alter his appearance in an effort to avoid capture.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S. military called radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's order to suspend his Mehdi Army militia for the next six months ""encouraging."" A Mehdi Army member holds a rocket launcher and the Quran during a parade in Baghdad in 2006. In a statement issued Saturday, the military said al-Sadr's order would enable the U.S.-led coalition and Iraqi security forces to ""intensify their focus on al Qaeda in Iraq...without distraction from [Mehdi Army] attacks."" Al-Sadr's suspension -- which one of his senior aides said would be a period for restructuring -- comes after nearly 60 people were killed and scores were injured during recent street fighting between armed Shiite factions in Karbala and Baghdad. ""Muqtada al-Sadr's declaration holds the potential to reduce criminal activity and help reunite Iraqis separated by ethno-sectarian violence and fear,"" the U.S. military said. The cleric, who emerged as a popular grass-roots Shiite leader after the U.S. toppled Saddam Hussein, has been staunchly opposed to the U.S. occupation. The U.S. military has tangled with his forces in Baghdad's Sadr City and in southern Iraq and, through the years, his political clout across Iraq's Shiite heartland has grown. The military believes rogue members of al-Sadr's group have smuggled weaponry and received training from Iran. An end to Mehdi Army ""would also be an important step in helping Iraqi authorities focus greater attention on achieving the political and economic solutions necessary for progress and less on dealing with criminal activity, sectarian violence, kidnappings, assassinations, and attacks on Iraqi and coalition forces,"" the military said. Al-Sadr has openly opposed violent actions before, and last week he called for calm and urged his followers not to attack rivals' offices. But observers think that many Mehdi Army fighters are breakaway forces who are more radical than al-Sadr himself. Iraq's government hopes the Mehdi Army's hiatus will spur similar moves by other armed groups. ""This initiative is an encouraging step toward consolidating security and stability throughout the country and an opportunity for the suspension of the work of the rest of the militias in various political and ideological affiliations to preserve the unity, independence and sovereignty of Iraq,"" Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's office said Thursday. The number of Iraqi civilians killed in violence across the country rose in August for the third consecutive month, the Iraqi Interior Ministry told CNN Friday. But the number of Iraqi soldiers and police officers killed dropped in August from last month's totals. Using figures collected from Iraqi Interior, Defense and Health ministries' records, the Interior Ministry said 1,773 civilians were killed in August, up from 1,653 in July. In June the number had dipped to 1,227 from May's 1,949. Twenty-one Iraqi soldiers were killed in August, compared with 79 in July and 31 in June. Sixty-six police officers were killed, down from 145 in July and 190 in June. U.S. troop deaths in August matched July's number of 79, the lowest toll since November 2006. According to CNN daily counts, the number of unidentified bodies recovered in Baghdad also dropped in August, to 428 from 612 in July and 563 in June. Those deaths would be part of the overall civilian death figures supplied to CNN by the Interior Ministry. The number of people described as insurgents who died in August was 472; up from 428 in July and 416 in June. E-mail to a friend .

"Let's face it -- it doesn't take much to convince us to do ridiculous things, document them and share them on the Internet. Make it for a good cause, and you get a viral sensation that starts with a single person and rides the wave of social media all the way to Hollywood, the White House and sports stadiums around the world. The Ice Bucket Challenge is a social media campaign that aims to raise awareness and money to fight Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. And it's simple, in the same way that laying stiff as a board in weird places or dancing the ""Harlem Shake"" is simple. Dump a bucket of ice-cold water over your head, then challenge a friend, or friends, to either do the same or donate money to the The ALS Association. Make a video of the whole thing and post it to your social media accounts. Voila! You've completed the #IceBucketChallenge. And while most viral Web trends tend to crop up, then disappear without accomplishing much other than providing a few chuckles, the Ice Bucket Challenge is making a difference. The ALS Association reports that it, and its 38 chapters, received $4 million in donations in just two weeks. Last year during that same time period, July 29-August 12, the association brought in $1.1 million. ""We have never seen anything like this in the history of the disease,"" said Barbara Newhouse, president and CEO of The ALS Association, in a news release. ""We couldn't be more thrilled with the level of compassion, generosity and sense of humor that people are exhibiting as they take part in this impactful viral initiative."" It all started with Pete Frates, a former baseball player at Boston College who has been living with ALS since 2012. He floated the idea and his former teammates, as well as other Boston-area athletes, took him up on it. It was noticed and covered by local media and that attention, along with the social Web's viral nature, launched it onto a much larger stage. Athletes, celebrities and politicians, as well as everyday folks, have gotten in on the act. For example, Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, himself a Boston College alum, took the challenge last week, then challenged his wide receiver corps -- Roddy White, Julio Jones and Harry Douglas -- to do the same. So far, Douglas and White have taken him up on it, with Douglas passing the challenge along to Cleveland Cavaliers star Lebron James and White challenging fellow NFL players Champ Bailey, Larry Fitzgerald and Eric Weems. (Of course for the Falcons, who are currently being profiled on HBO's documentary series ""Hard Knocks,"" a bucket of ice water might not have seemed so bad during training camp in the Georgia heat). And leave it to a hockey player to try to show he's tougher than everybody else. NHL player Paul Bissonnette, most recently of the Phoenix Coyotes, posted a YouTube video of himself in his underwear, having frigid glacier water dumped on him by a helicopter. He, too, called out James, as well as NFL quarterbacks Aaron Murray and Russell Wilson. Jimmy Fallon, Martha Stewart, and Justin Timberlake are among the celebrities who have gotten wet for the cause. Even broadcasting legend and former CNN host Larry King joined in -- well, kind of. King made one of his producers take the icy plunge. In the world of politics, the Boston area's most famous family, the Kennedys, joined in a big way. More than 20 members dumped buckets of ice water on their heads then challenged ""Grandma Ethel"" -- the 86-year-old family matriarch and widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- who did so after challenging President Obama himself. Obama declined the opportunity to dump ice water on himself on camera. But he'll be making a donation to the cause. ""The President appreciates Mrs. Kennedy thinking of him for the challenge -- though his contribution to this effort will be monetary,"" Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz said Tuesday. Of course, many of the folks who take the challenge also donate, which accounts in part for the big numbers for the ALS Association. But the very act of making the cause viral has been hugely important, too. ""While the monetary donations are absolutely incredible,"" said Newhouse, ""the visibility that this disease is getting as a result of the challenge is truly invaluable. People who have never before heard of ALS are now engaged in the fight to find treatments and a cure for ALS."" Currently, there is only one FDA-approved drug for ALS and that one only extends survival by several months, according to the ALSA. People with the disease lose control of muscle movement, eventually losing their ability to eat, speak, walk and, ultimately, breathe.

"Washington (CNN)One day after focusing on lost e-mails at the IRS, the House Oversight Committee learned Wednesday that the Environmental Protection Agency is also having trouble recovering e-mails the committee wants as part of a separate investigation. McCarthy: ""There is a challenge"" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told the Republican-led committee that the agency cannot access some e-mails belonging to a biologist who worked on a controversial mining project assessment. It is a hard drive problem, but McCarthy was careful to not call it a ""hard drive crash"" or destroyed hard drive. ""I don't believe this is a missing hard drive issue,"" McCarthy told the panel, ""There is a challenge getting access to the data on it... I'm still hoping we recover all those e-mails."" ""I heard similar testimony yesterday,"" replied Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, dryly referring to the committee's Tuesday hearing about a critical crashed hard drive at the IRS. Investigation into mine report . With the EPA, the committee is investigating whether the biologist involved, or anyone else at the agency, colluded with environmentalists to produce a negative assessment of a mining proposal in Alaska. A separate investigation by the agency's inspector general is also underway. The environmental assessment concluded that the Pebble Mine project could significantly harm the sockeye salmon fishery in Bristol Bay. As a result, in February, the agency essentially froze the permitting process for the mine as it reviews options for the area. McCarthy insisted the agency is trying to recover the biologists' missing e-mails, but also tried to downplay his role in the mine assessment. ""He's not a decison maker in this process,"" she said. ""He inputed into the science assessment that's been fully peer-reviewed. We have not made any decision on Bristol Bay, we've just taken a first step."" ""But he could have colluded..."" fired back Meadows. ""Which is why it's important the (inspector general) finish his report,"" McCarthy replied. Did the EPA break the law? Meadows pressed McCarthy on whether the agency broke federal records-keeping law.  ""Were all his emails preserved according to the Federal Records Act or was a law violated?"" McCarthy answered that the EPA notified the National Archives and Records Administration about the hard drive problem Tuesday. ""I think we have notified the appropriate authorities that we may have some e-mails that we cannot produce that we should have kept."" Issa (re)threatens contempt charge . During the same hearing, Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, also demanded that the agency turn over documents that the committee subpoenaed last year. ""You have not complied with the subpoena,"" he told McCarthy. ""I am telling you, the time to comply is now. If it is not complied with... this committee will consider and vote on contempt."" Issa has made this threat to McCarthy before, but indicated Wednesday that he expects a response within days or he is ready to act on the contempt charge. By the end of the hearing, McCarthy and Issa agreed to let their staffs work behind the scenes. ""I hope that over the next few days our folks and your folks can resolve this with all the e-mails,"" Issa concluded. E-mails: Ex-IRS official Lois Lerner queried Sen. Chuck Grassley invitation .

"Two of the United States' most recognizable military aircraft -- a pair of B-2 stealth bombers -- caught the eyes of residents as they arrived in Europe this week for training. ""They seem to defy science!"" said one Twitter user in Cirencester, England, who saw one of the stealth bombers in flight. The bombers' unique radar-evading design always draws attention, as does this training mission in particular, which comes at a time of conflict in Ukraine. An Air Force news release about the mission did not mention the Ukraine crisis, but U.S. fighter jets have previously been deployed to Europe on similar training missions to show support for NATO allies. The mission for the pair of stealth bombers, the Air Force said, is to conduct flights in Europe and to become familiar with air bases and operations in the area. ""This deployment of strategic bombers provides an invaluable opportunity to strengthen and improve interoperability with our allies and partners,"" said Adm. Cecil Haney, commander of U.S. Strategic Command. ""The training and integration of strategic forces demonstrates to our nation's leaders and our allies that we have the right mix of aircraft and expertise to respond to a variety of potential threats and situations."" The B-2s are assigned to the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. ""Just saw a Stealth Bomber fly over our house,"" another resident said on Twitter. ""Amazing aircraft.

"A German court has thrown out a case against a former SS member accused of participating in the massacre of 642 residents of a French village during World War II. The 89-year-old had been accused of murdering 25 people and aiding the murder of several hundred others at Oradour-sur-Glane in central France on June 10, 1944. According to the indictment, troops surrounded the village before rounding up all the residents in the town square and separating the men from the women and children. The men were shot in four barns, which were then burned down. The women and children were imprisoned in a church into which explosives and hand grenades were thrown. Troops then set that building alight, killing any survivors of the initial attack. There was no doubt that members of the man's Panzer regiment had killed the Oradour-sur-Glane residents and burned down the village, the Cologne Regional Court said in a statement Tuesday. But the court said it was unlikely the case against the pensioner, named by local media only as Werner C., would have been provable. Demonstrating he had been present in the village on the day of the massacre would not on its own have been enough to prove the charges against him, it said. Oradour-sur-Glane Mayor Philippe Lacroix told CNN the decision would be appealed. ""We need to go through with the lawsuit for the families. Time does not excuse the crime,"" he said. ""Germany has worked hard to ensure that the trial takes place, and we hope it will succeed."" Radio France International quoted prosecutor Andreas Brendel as saying he was ""surprised"" by the Cologne court's decision, despite evidence in such cases being ""extremely thin."" The ruins of Oradour-sur-Glane have been preserved as a monument to those killed there. The village's Centre de la Memoire, or Memory Center, says 300,000 people visit the ""martyr village"" annually.","A court has thrown out a case against a man accused of taking part in a massacre in France .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Conservationists claimed one of their most significant victories of the new administration Monday as President Obama signed sweeping land reform legislation designating 2 million additional acres of public wilderness areas. Lawmakers applaud as  President Obama signs 2009 Omnibus Public Land Management Act . The federal wilderness designation provides the highest level of government protection from logging and other forms of commercial use and development. ""This legislation guarantees that we will not take our forests, rivers, oceans ... monuments, and wilderness areas for granted, but rather we will set them aside and guard their sanctity for everyone to share,"" Obama said at a White House signing ceremony. ""That's something all Americans can support."" The land protected by the 2009 Omnibus Public Land Management Act, a compilation of over 160 separate legislative proposals, extends across nine states. Among other things, the law also establishes 10 new National Heritage sites, authorizes numerous Bureau of Reclamation water projects, and alters several national park boundaries. It specifically creates 21 new wilderness areas and expands 19 existing wilderness areas in 10 national forests. One of the largest swaths of newly protected wilderness is in California, where over 380,000 additional acres are set aside by the law. The covered areas incorporate the eastern Sierra Nevada, Los Angeles County's San Gabriel Mountains, and the desert areas of Riverside County. In the Pacific Northwest, more than 136,000 acres have been designated to protect areas surrounding Mount Hood and the Copper Salmon headwaters, according to the Department of Agriculture.","Obama signs bill designating 2 million additional acres of public wilderness areas .

"Two men were charged Thursday in connection with a terror plot that Australia's prime minister said involved plans  to carry out a public execution. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said authorities obtained intelligence about a ""demonstration killing"" -- a killing, Australian media reported, in which alleged assailants planned to kidnap a member of the public, behead the victim and then drape him or her in an ISIS flag. The foiled plot comes just days after the country raised its terror alert to high and in the midst of Australia committing to helping the United States and a broad international coalition to beat back the Islamic State, or ISIS. The militant group has been slaughtering people and taking over villages in Syria and Iraq. One of its members beheaded two Western journalists and an aid worker -- brutality that was videotaped and broadcast throughout the world. ISIS vows that it will stop at nothing to create a caliphate governed by the intensely strict Sharia law. Suspects arrested, detained . Earlier Thursday, at least one person had been arrested and charged with terrorism offenses and another 14 were detained as police conducted more than two dozen searches in Sydney, acting Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said at a news conference. Hours later, police said nine people who were detained have been released. A 24-year-old man from Merrylands has been charged with possession of ammunition without a license and unauthorized possession of a prohibited weapon, authorities said. Another man has also stood in court, charged with conspiracy to commit acts in preparation of a terrorist act and financing terrorism, police said, and two women were issued notices to appear later in court. Their names have not been released. Authorities declined to give details about the threat, citing an ongoing operation. But Abbott told reporters that intelligence revealed that Islamic militants inside Australia were planning to kill. ""The exhortations, quite direct exhortations, were coming from an Australian who is apparently quite senior in ISIL (Islamic State) to networks of support back in Australia to conduct demonstration killings here in this country,"" he said. Early morning raids . More than 800 law enforcement officials fanned out across Sydney suburbs as part of a coordinated operation to serve 25 search warrants. ""Today's operation reflects the reality of the threat we actually face,"" said Andrew Scipione, commissioner of New South Wales Police. A second series of searches were carried out in Brisbane, Scipione said. Those searches were connected to the arrests earlier this month of two men in Brisbane accused of recruiting and financing foreign fighters to Syria. The commissioner said authorities are looking for links between the Sydney operation and the one in Brisbane. Meanwhile, police presence has been increased at Parliament because of security threats, Abbott told Channel 7 on Friday. Citing an intelligence review carried out in recent days, Abbott said federal police will be taking over security inside and outside of Parliament. Terror alert raised to 'high' Australia last week raised its terror alert level to ""high"" for the first time since the national alert system was introduced in 2003. It's the second-highest alert level. According to the four-level system, a reading of ""high"" means a terrorist attack is likely. The decision to raise the level was foreshadowed by the departing director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) last week. David Irvine said the threat level had been building in Australia over the last year, due to the increasing influence of Australian jihadists who had gone to fight for ISIS in the Middle East and then returned home. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Irvine said more than 20 Australians had returned home after fighting in Iraq or Syria, and about 60 Australians are currently fighting with extremist groups. Australia joins anti-terror coalition . This week, the Australian government was one of 40 nations that agreed to contribute to the fight against ISIS, the terror group that calls itself the Islamic State. The government has agreed to send military advisers to Iraq, and it will deploy a number of aircraft, including fighter jets, to the United Arab Emirates. It also will also help to stem the humanitarian crisis. Australian combat troops will not participate in ground fighting, according to Abbott.","Security ramped up at Parliament, PM Tony Abbott says .

"Heavy rain continued to lash the northern Philippines on Wednesday, a day after flooding put more than half of the Manila region under water. The relentless monsoon rains, intensified by a tropical storm at sea, have so far led to eight deaths. More than 280,000 people have fled from their homes, authorities said. The muddy flood waters have swamped roads and buildings, bringing life in many areas to a standstill. La Mesa Reservoir, in a densely populated area of the Manila region, is overflowing, the national disaster agency reported, prompting the evacuation of thousands of residents from surrounding neighborhoods. The water at several other dams in the region is near critical levels, it said. More than 500 areas across 78 municipalities and cities on the main island of Luzon have been reported as flooded, the disaster agency said Wednesday. A state of calamity has been declared in three provinces, three cities and eight municipalities, it said. Widespread disruption . Brought about by days of fierce rain, floods have disrupted air and land transportation, and caused the closure of schools, businesses and nonemergency government offices. At one point Tuesday, as much as 60% of the Manila metropolitan region was flooded, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report. The region, known as Metro Manila, has about 12 million residents. The waters later subsided, leaving about 20% of Metro Manila under water, the U.N. office said. iReport: Flooding clogs streets of Manila . 'It was raining nonstop' Lorie Pascua, said she and her family had been trapped since Monday in their house in Cavite, one of the hardest hit provinces near Manila. ""The water in our village surrounding our house was over six feet high for three days."" she said. ""It was raining nonstop."" Pascua, 75, said the family's house wasn't flooded but the waters around it prevented them from leaving. Residents living along a creek in the family's area of the city of Bacoor had to be relocated to dry ground, she said. ""It floods here all the time but this is the worst so far,"" Pascua said. Lighter rain . The rainfall across the northern Philippines appeared to be less intense Wednesday compared with previous days. Trami, the tropical storm that exacerbated the monsoon rains over Luzon in recent days, has moved farther away from the Philippines in the past 24 hours. The storm is forecast to brush past northern Taiwan on Wednesday and make landfall in the Chinese province of Fujian on Thursday. But Pagasa, the Philippine national weather agency, still issued a ""Yellow Rainfall Advisory"" on Wednesday that forecast ""moderate to heavy rains"" for Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Flooding remains a risk in low-lying areas, according to the agency. Pascua said it was still raining in Bacoor on Wednesday, but not continuously. The water levels have subsided to knee-level, she said, but the family is still unable to venture out to get supplies. Pascua said her family members had been surviving on the food left in their fridge until they received some rations Wednesday. An annual disaster . The national disaster agency reported that eight people have died as a result of the rain and floods in Luzon, mostly by drowning. Four more people are missing and 41 have been injured, it said. About 281,000 people have had to leave their homes and seek shelter with friends and relatives or in evacuation centers, the council said. Images showed displaced people using the pews in a church in Quezon City, part of Metro Manila, as makeshift beds. The pouring rain and rising water are grimly familiar to Manila residents as August is generally the area's wettest month. Severe flooding in the region a year ago, also caused by monsoon rains, killed scores of people.

"Washington (CNN) -- A college senior studying Arabic says he was wrongly detained for almost five hours last summer after an airport screener found his Arabic-English flash cards and a book critical of U.S. foreign policy. Nicholas George, 22, a senior at Pomona College in California, filed suit in federal court Wednesday against the Transportation Security Administration, the Philadelphia Police Department and the FBI. He says he was handcuffed and ""abusively interrogated"" by authorities at Philadelphia International Airport. The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, alleges officials violated George's Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable seizure and First Amendment rights to free speech. ""Nick doesn't object and we don't object to the fact that he was searched closely, that his belongings were scrutinized,"" ACLU attorney Ben Wizner told CNN. ""But once that's done, there's absolutely no justification for handcuffing him and locking him in a cell for several hours."" All three agencies named in the suit declined to comment. But one official, who could not speak on the record about matters involving pending litigation, said security agents focused on George because of ""erratic"" behavior before he reached the checkpoint. George, of Wyncote, Pennsylvania, said he is studying Arabic because of his interest in Middle East politics. He plans to take a foreign service exam later this year, he said. ""I want to serve my country using my Arabic language,"" George told CNN. ""And it just seems crazy to me that for that I was arrested and treated like a criminal."" He said the incident occurred August 29 after he arrived at the Philadelphia airport for a flight to California to begin his senior year at Pomona College. When he was asked to empty his pockets at the airport checkpoint, he produced a set of handmade flash cards, which piqued the interest of the TSA screener. The flash cards had an English word on one side and the corresponding Arabic word on the other. Of the approximately 200 flash cards, about 10 had words such as ""bomb,"" ""explosion,"" and ""terrorist,"" George said. ""They asked me why I had those words. I told them honestly because I had been trying to read Arabic news media, especially Al-Jazeera, and these are words that come up when you read the news about the Middle East,"" George said. He said he was in the secondary screening area for about a half hour before a TSA supervisor arrived and began questioning him in a ""hostile and aggressive manner."" Noting that George had a book titled ""Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions,"" the supervisor asked him a series of questions, including ""Who did 9/11?"" and ""Do you know what language he spoke?"" The supervisor then held up the flash cards and said, ""Do you see why these cards are suspicious?"" George said. He said he was then turned over to a Philadelphia police officer, who handcuffed him and placed him in an airport jail cell while officers examined his possessions. They ""appeared particularly interested in the flash cards"" and a student ID card issued to George during a study abroad program in Jordan. George later was turned over to the FBI, who questioned him for about 30 minutes before freeing him. ""My attitude during all of this was -- just answer the questions fully and honestly. Don't give any lip. Don't do anything that will arouse suspicion, and they'll just pass it by because I had nothing seditious. ... I had nothing dangerous. I had nothing that would pose any threat to anyone,"" George told CNN. ""I'm absolutely certain that I never raised my voice. I never got smart with them,"" he said. George said he is angered by his treatment. One government official, who spoke on background because of the pending litigation, said TSA behavior detection officers observed George ""exhibiting anomalous behavior"" before he reached the checkpoint. The official did not elaborate. George ""was referred for additional screening, where his behavior escalated further,"" the official said. ""As a result of a number of factors, including the passenger's erratic behavior, local law enforcement was called to the checkpoint to investigate further."" ACLU attorney Wizner called the alleged incident ""an amazing abuse of authority."" ""We need to really make clear that Americans don't give up their constitutional rights when they choose to fly by plane,"" he said. ""When Nick George was handcuffed, arrested and locked in a cell for several hours just for carrying Arabic-English flash cards, that was not only illegal and unconstitutional but absolutely did nothing to make air travel any safer. ""In fact what it does is it diverts resources from the kind of real security efforts that we need more of."" One year ago, JetBlue Airways and two TSA screeners paid $240,000 to an Iraqi man to settle claims that they refused to let him aboard a flight until he had covered up his T-shirt, which read, ""We Will Not be Silent"" in English and Arabic. The man, Raed Jarrar, said one screener told him, ""Coming to an airport while wearing a T-shirt with Arabic letters on it was equivalent to going into a bank while wearing a shirt saying, 'I am a robber.' "" In the settlement, JetBlue and the screeners denied any wrongdoing, and said they were acting only to resolve the 2 1/2-year-old federal lawsuit. CNN's Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Nicholas George, 22, took flash cards used to study Arabic to airport last summer .

"Attorney General Eric Holder announced Monday that members of the Chinese military have engaged in the hacking of American businesses and entities, including U.S. Steel Corp., Westinghouse, Alcoa, Allegheny Technologies, the United Steel Workers Union and SolarWorld. The victims operate in Pennsylvania, and a grand jury there returned a 31-count indictment against members of the Chinese military, accusing them of violating federal law by hacking to spy and steal secrets, Holder said. The indictment alleges that five People's Liberation Army officers ""maintained unauthorized access to victim computers to steal information from these entities that would be useful"" to the victims' competitors in China, the attorney general said. Their names are Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu and Gu Chunhui, according to the indictment. The Chinese government did not immediately confirm or deny the veracity of the names. In some instances, the hackers stole trade secrets that would have been ""particularly beneficial to Chinese companies at the time that they were stolen,"" Holder said. In other cases, they are accused of swiping sensitive internal communications that could provide a competitor or a litigation adversary with insight into the strategy and the vulnerabilities of the victimized companies and entities, he said. The attorney general said that he hopes the Chinese government will work with American officials to bring the offenders to justice and that the United States intends to prosecute. The Chinese Embassy in Washington referred questions to a statement on China's Foreign Ministry site in which spokesman Qin Gang called the charges ""extremely absurd."" He said that the United States ""has fabricated facts"" and that China is a ""staunch defender of cyber security."" The statement said the Chinese government, its military and ""associated personnel never engage in any theft of trade secrets."" The indictment ""severely violates basic norms of international relations, and harms cooperation and mutual trust between China and the United States,"" the statement said. China protested the U.S. action, the Foreign Ministry statement said, and wants it to ""correct its mistake"" and withdraw the charge. China is a ""victim of U.S. cyber surveillance and theft,"" the spokesman asserted, saying that ""certain U.S. agencies have been consistently tapping into China's government agencies, corporates, universities, and private networks for surveillance purposes."" Sensitive subject . A spokeswoman for the State Department told reporters that Washington wants to have more dialogue with Beijing about the issue. ""We remain deeply concerned about Chinese government-sponsored, cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets and other sensitive business information for commercial gain,"" Jen Psaki said. ""And, again, this was specific to the actions of ... of just a few individuals. And we hope that the Chinese government can understand that."" This was a law enforcement case, she added, not a diplomatic one. ""We continue to believe --  and this is relevant to us, our role here at the State Department -- that we can have a constructive and productive relationship with China,"" she said. ""We're ready to work with China to prevent these types of activities from continuing."" Joining Holder, David Hickton, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said the alleged hacking has caused the victimized U.S. companies to lose capital investments in research and technology. He added that the ""important message"" is that cyberespionage ""impacts real people in real and painful ways,"" he said. ""The lifeblood of any organization is the people who work, strive and sweat for it. When these cyberintrusions occur, production slows, plants close, workers get laid off and lose their homes,"" Hickton said. ""Hacking, spying and cybertheft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally even when the defendants are state actors,"" he said. These are the first charges against Chinese state officials for what the U.S. says is a widespread problem, U.S. officials told CNN before Holder's remarks. At a regular news briefing at the White House on Monday, press secretary Jay Carney was asked about the case. ""This is an issue that has been brought up by President Obama with (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping) in their meetings as recently as in March as a general problem that we have seen and reflects the president's overall concern about cybersecurity,"" Carney said. ""We have consistently and candidly raised these concerns with the Chinese government, and today's announcement reflects our growing concern that this Chinese behavior has continued."" He was adamant that the U.S. ""intelligence programs serve a specific national security mission, and that does not include providing a competitive advantage to U.S. companies or U.S. economic interests,"" Carney said. ""In other words, we do not do what those Chinese nationals were indicted for earlier today. Period.""

"(CNN)Oh, that pesky history of ours. Always holding us back. Why not just take a big ole' eraser to it? Smudge out the ugly parts. That's essentially what some Oklahoma lawmakers aimed to do this week. You may have read about it: An education committee in my home state -- a place with plenty of historical blemishes and oodles of modern-day screw-ups -- actually approved a bill that would rewrite advanced placement U.S. History classes, potentially eliminating them. The cause? They paint America in too negative a light. To get a full sense of how ludicrous this proposal is, you need to hear straight from its sponsor, Dan Fisher, a Republican state representative from a suburb of Oklahoma City. ""In essence, we have a new emphasis on what is bad about America,"" Fisher said in a committee hearing, according to a CNN report. ""(The new framework) trades an emphasis on America's founding principles of constitutional government in favor of robust analyses of gender and racial oppression and class ethnicity and the lives of marginalized people, where the emphasis on instruction is of America as a nation of oppressors and exploiters."" Fisher's bill, as it was proposed, bars state money from going to AP U.S. history courses, according to CNN. It also requires the replacement class to cover a number of ""founding documents of the United States that contributed to the foundation or maintenance of the representative form of limited government, the free-market economic system and American exceptionalism."" Oh, and speeches by Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Sense a political slant there? Nah. The proposal is a major sideshow in a state with some serious educational failings. Education Week ranked Oklahoma's educational system 48th out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C., ""with an overall score of 67.6 out of 100 points and a grade of D-plus."" A D-plus! Hoo-rah! Better cut back on those think-y classes. The state's teachers make, on average, about $44,000 per year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, which uses stats from the 2012-2013 school year. The national average is more than $56,000. Fisher could use his time to focus on either of these issues -- poor educational performance or low teacher pay -- instead of distracting all of us with this heap of revisionist, partisan nonsense. The AP history bill itself is being rewritten, The Tulsa World reported on Wednesday. And Fisher apparently has backed off wanting to kill AP U.S. history altogether. But, I'm sorry. That's almost beside the point. What bothers me is that Fisher had the gall to propose something so ludicrous in the first place. Doing so makes my home state -- a place I'm immensely proud of -- look ridiculous. It wastes my time and yours. And, more to the point, it flies arrogantly in the face of history. American history -- despite what Fisher or those Republicans at the National Prayer Breakfast might say -- is anything but crisp, clean and ""exceptional."" This is one of the greatest countries on Earth, to be sure. We have freedoms of speech and religion that are unmatched worldwide. But we are not perfect. We have to acknowledge that. Embrace it. It's the only way we can move forward. The only way we prevent history from repeating itself. Oklahoma -- Fisher and his fringe cohorts aside -- has proven to be good at this. Oklahoma City was the site of one of the worst terror attacks in this country's history, the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. An American, Timothy McVeigh, was executed for that crime. Now, the city has a beautiful memorial in tribute to the victims of that tragedy. It has a museum decrying hate. It cherishes the ""survivor tree,"" a beautiful American Elm, which withstood that 1995 blast and now serves as a symbol of the city's and the state's resilience in the face of hardship. You can't erase those memories, and Oklahomans wouldn't want to. You learn from them. The same goes for the ""robust analyses of gender and racial oppression and class ethnicity and the lives of marginalized people"" that the Oklahoma rep seems so bothered by. This is a country that remains ensnared by all those things. We can't close our eyes and plug our ears. We're still tangled in the awful legacy of slavery and the racism that's followed. The Trail of Tears marched American Indians into present day Oklahoma, and it's not such a distant cultural memory, especially there. Nationwide, women still aren't paid as much as men for the same work. And there are still 13 states where gay and lesbian people aren't allowed to be married -- and 29, including Oklahoma, according to the Human Rights Campaign, where they can be fired because of their sexual orientation. These injustices are historic -- and they're now. You'd think we'd get that. But apparently it bears repeating. So, I guess, does this: We have to learn from these mistakes in order to move forward. Sweeping them aside in favor of preaching ""exceptionalism"" in the classroom isn't just ignorant -- it's dangerous. Instead of rewriting history we should learn from it. And write a better future.","Oklahoma lawmaker proposes rewrite of U.S. history class .

"Tea party groups describe an arduous IRS application process for tax-exempt status with probing questions and long delays. In addition to standard questions that organizations face when applying for tax-exempt status, a handful of tea party organizations told CNN they were asked probing questions about the websites they maintained, literature they use for research and future activities the groups had planned. Acting commissioner of IRS resigns . The IRS scandal over how it processed tax-exempt applications from tea party and conservative groups has already cost the acting director his job and caused lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to call for an extensive investigation about how the prejudicial screening was allowed to happen. Many of the tea party groups opted to seek tax-exempt status as social welfare organizations under Section 501 (c) (4) of the federal tax code after the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case. That exemption allows groups to fundraise without disclosing donors, but requires that any participation in campaigns of elections must be for the promotion of social welfare. Larry Norvig, executive director of the Richmond Tea Party, said he first sought 501 (c) (4) tax-exempt status for his group in December 2009.  The tea party group didn't hear from the IRS until September of 2010, when the taxing body had 17 more questions for the group, which Norvig answered. More than a year went by when the IRS had another 12 questions for the Norvig's group in January 2012. While he shrugged off the first set as benign, he said he was shocked by the second round. In the second set of questions, the IRS asked the Richmond Tea Party to provide ""the time, location and detailed description of each event or program"" in which the group had ""conducted or participated"" since October 2010. The IRS also asked for ""copies of handouts"" provided to the audience at all of the group's events since that date. Norvig was most strartled when the IRS asked for ""copies of your current web pages and your presentations on other web pages such as social networking sites and blog sites."" The IRS also asked to see private pages that were ""accessible only to your members."" ""We were quite alarmed,"" Norvig said. Although he admits he only answered part of the questions, Norvig said his group received its tax-exempt status in July 2012. CNN reached out to the IRS for this story but received no response. Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller resigned over the controversy on Wednesday night. In a statement, President Barack Obama vowed new safeguards to ensure that such targeting is not repeated at the IRS. ""Americans have a right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it,"" he said. According to a Treasury Department inspector general's report this week, the IRS used keywords that generally applied to conservative and tea party groups in determining whether an application deserved more scrutiny. The Indiana TEA Party is another conservative group that says it received scrutiny similar to that given to other tea party organizations. 'Angry' Obama announces IRS leader's ouster after conservatives targeted . Documents from March 2012 provided to CNN by Ken Johnson of the Indiana group shows the IRS asked for copies of ""the pages"" of its website -- including social networking sites -- and a ""list"" of the group's ""activities to date,"" including a description of each event. The IRS also asked the group to ""provide a list of your communication to your members or others,"" including speeches, e-mails, flyers, billboards and ""other literature."" ""We didn't know what was going on,"" Johnson said. Johnson said he was so frustrated by the process that he just gave up on the tax application. ""We took a look at the requested information and basically said there is no possible way that we can reproduce, for example, hard copies of every web page on our site that we had,"" Johnson said. ""They wanted a hard copy of every piece of literature that we had distributed at a street fair or at a meeting or at an event and quite honestly, we couldn't do it."" So Johnson and the Indiana TEA Party just didn't respond to the inquiry. ""We just said fine, we will file as a different organization,"" Johnson said. Even though the group failed to respond to the questions, the Indiana TEA Party received a letter from the IRS office in Cincinnati that its tax-exempt status was approved on February 22, 2012. ""Do I have confidence in this organization. The answer is no,"" Johnson said, confused as to how he was approved after he didn't answer their questions. Read IRS watchdog's report . A number of other tea party organizations tell similar stories. ""They wanted us to predict the future, like asking us in the future what kind of events we would hold, taking part of and how much money we would spend on those events in the future,"" Toby Marie Walker, president of the Waco Tea Party told CNN. Walker said the questions she was asked were similar to those asked of the other tea party groups -- the IRS asked about her website, events she had participated in and any connections she had with elected officials in her area. ""We called the IRS and we asked them, 'OK, can you tell us what, first of all, 'close relationships' means,'"" Walker said about her call with the IRS. ""My state rep is also my dogs' veterinarian. Is that something that you want?"" Like other groups, Walker said she did her best to answer all the questions but eventually just sent incomplete responses to the IRS. ""These questions are impossible to answer,"" Walker said. ""We felt that they were trying to bury us in paperwork so that it would be more difficult to comply and get our status."" Like other groups, Walker eventually sent incomplete answers to the IRS. If we had done everything they wanted, ""it would have taken a U-Haul truck,"" Walker joked. The Waco Tea Party received its tax-exempt status in March, 2013. The IRS has identified two ""rogue"" employees in the agency's Cincinnati office as being principally responsible for the ""overly aggressive"" handling of requests by conservative groups for tax-exempt status, a congressional source told CNN. Tim Curtis, co-founder and chairman of the Tampa 9/12 project, a conservative group that applied to tax-exempt status in 2010, said his organization also experienced similar scrutiny. In August of 2010, Curtis said the IRS sent him a similar letter to other groups and asked for ""screen shots of website pages"" and ""what research material we have used to develop our materials when we were conducting our meetings."" ""Our only concern was that we comply with the law, we had no reason to suspect anything was amiss at that point,"" Curtis said. ""Obviously in hindsight, we know that not to be the case."" For a group of people that was already deeply skeptical of government, his encounter with the IRS validated his mistrust of the government. ""At this point now, the question for us is now we know you have been lying about everything else,"" Curtis said. ""What else has been going on that we didn't know of?""

"(CNN) -- Before there was a ""Man of Steel,"" there was the story of his ancestors and his home planet. Syfy is developing ""Krypton,"" a prequel origin series that will tell the story of Superman's grandfather. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the drama will focus on his grandfather's fight to bring equality to the planet. The network is said to be working with David S. Goyer, the scribe behind the ""Man of Steel"" film as well as Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. It's just the latest comic book-to-television project, joining Fox's ""Gotham,"" CW's ""The Flash"" and ""Arrow,"" and the upcoming ""Titans"" from TNT and ""Supergirl"" from CBS. (TNT is owned by the parent company of CNN.) The news was met with mixed reaction on the Web. ""A prequel. From the writer of MAN OF STEEL. On Syfy. Wow. #Krypton manages all three strikes with just its announcement,"" tweeted one fan, while another noted, ""Rather than do a full series, SyFy should do a TV movie or miniseries version of #Krypton first. Then see if it's worth doing more stories."" Though fans may be skeptical, The Hollywood Reporter points out that Goyer, who conceived the ""Krypton"" story with ""Once Upon a Time's"" Ian Goldberg, is force behind plenty of projects fanboys and girls are familiar with. ""For Goyer, 'Krypton' will mark his third series on the air joining 'Constantine' and Starz's 'Da Vinci's Demons,' "" the publication notes.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Thursday made official the long-held but rarely stated U.S. support for a future Palestinian state based on borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war. In the past, the United States has unofficially backed a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict based on the borders in place prior to the war 44 years ago in which Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights and Sinai Peninsula. In a major speech Thursday, Obama became the first president to formally endorse the policy, but he also acknowledged the need for modifications through the negotiating process due to conditions on the ground. ""The United States believes that negotiations should result in two states, with permanent Palestinian borders with Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, and permanent Israeli borders with Palestine,"" Obama said in the concluding section of his 45-minute address that looked at political and social change sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa. ""We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states,"" Obama continued. His position agreed with the Palestinian negotiating stance on border issues in the staggering peace process, now stalled again by disputes over Israel settlements in the West Bank and the role of Hamas -- a terrorist group in the eyes of the United States and Israel -- in the Palestinian leadership. At the same time, Obama reiterated unwavering U.S. support for Israel's security, and he endorsed major negotiating positions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, including an incremental handover of security responsibilities by Israel when conditions on the ground allow it. Obama declared the U.S. commitment to Israel's security ""unshakable,"" and said ""every state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able to defend itself -- by itself -- against any threat."" ""Provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism; to stop the infiltration of weapons; and to provide effective border security,"" Obama continued, touching on the major concerns of Israel in facing a new Palestinian neighbor. ""The full and phased withdrawal of Israeli military forces should be coordinated with the assumption of Palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign, non-militarized state. And the duration of this transition period must be agreed, and the effectiveness of security arrangements must be demonstrated."" In a later interview with the BBC, Obama said that ""the basis for negotiations will involve looking at that 1967 border, recognizing that conditions on the ground have changed and there are going to need to be swaps to accommodate the interests of both sides."" ""That's on the one hand and on the other hand, and this was an equally important part of the speech, Israel is going to have to feel confident about its security on the West Bank and that security element is going to be important to the Israelis."" Obama said in the interview. Tony Blair, the former British prime minister now working as part of international efforts to secure an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, said the security assurances and provisions are essential to the territorial issue. ""I think it's saying in essence, that the Palestinians have got to be sure that their state is viable in terms of territory,"" Blair told CNN shortly after Obama spoke. ""Obviously, there are going to be deviations or changes (from the exact 1967 borders) that are mutually agreeable."" On the other hand, Blair said, Israel has the right to protect itself. As expected, initial reaction was mostly negative. A statement from Netanyahu's office rejected what it called a withdrawal to the 1967 borders, calling them ""indefensible"" and noting it would leave major Israeli population centers in Palestinian territory. Hamas also rejected the speech. Political opponents also criticized Obama, with possible Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney saying the president had ""thrown Israel under the bus."" ""He has disrespected Israel and undermined its ability to negotiate peace,"" Romney said in a statement. ""He has also violated a first principle of American foreign policy, which is to stand firm by our friends."" The president used his speech to speak directly to both Israel and Palestinians, declaring that both sides must yield on some deeply entrenched positions in order to bring peace that is desired and needed by both the region and the world. He criticized both sides for ""unmet"" expectations despite decades of efforts by U.S. administrations, including his own, to facilitate an agreement. In particular, Obama cited Israel's insistence on building new housing settlements on the West Bank and other areas beyond its 1967 borders. On Thursday, Israel announced the approval of projects to build 1,500 housing units in Har Homa and Pisgat Zeev, which are outside the 1967 borders. Roye Lackmanovich, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said the projects had previously received initial approval. ""The status quo is unsustainable, and Israel too must act boldly to advance a lasting peace,"" Obama said, adding that ""the dream of a Jewish and democratic state cannot be fulfilled with permanent occupation."" Obama also rejected any Palestinian effort to challenge Israel's right to exist, saying they would ""end in failure."" He noted an expected push for a symbolic U.N. General Assembly resolution in September ""won't create an independent state."" While calling for positive steps by both sides on territory and security issues, Obama said he recognized two ""wrenching and emotional issues"" remain unresolved -- the future status of Jerusalem, which is claimed by both sides, and the fate of Palestinian refugees who claim Israel as their homeland. Obama also repeated the strong U.S. opposition to Hamas playing a leadership role unless it recognizes Israel's right to exist and renounces terrorism. ""The recent announcement of an agreement between Fatah and Hamas raises profound and legitimate questions for Israel -- how can one negotiate with a party that has shown itself unwilling to recognize your right to exist,"" Obama said. ""In the weeks and months to come, Palestinian leaders will have to provide a credible answer to that question."" Netanyahu's statement cited the refugee and Hamas issues as major obstacles to renewed peace talks sought by Obama. ""Without a solution to the Palestinian refugee problem outside the borders of Israel, no territorial concession will bring peace,"" said the statement, adding that Netanyahu -- who will meet with Obama on Friday in Washington -- ""will also express his disappointment over the Palestinian Authority's decision to embrace Hamas, a terror organization committed to Israel's destruction."" Obama acknowledged the ""suspicion and hostility"" that impeded the peace process, but added he was ""convinced that the majority of Israelis and Palestinians would rather look to the future than be trapped in the past.""

"Elections in Tunisia on Sunday are about much more than one country. They could mark a big step toward democracy. If the country's transition toward democracy ""continues to move forward, it would be a powerful signal that democracy can take root in the Arab world,"" said Anthony Dworkin of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""At a time when hopes of moving towards political reform and accountable governments elsewhere in the Arab world have been dashed, Tunisia is the only country where the aspirations of the Arab uprisings may yet be fulfilled in the near future,"" Dworkin wrote in an analysis. ""Even if Tunisia's example does not inspire any immediate followers in the region, the consolidation of a successful democracy in the country would be a powerful signal that reform and political pluralism are not doomed to fail in the Arab world."" Tunisians headed to the polls to vote for their first post-revolution parliament, marking the end of three years of transitional governance that has been marred by rising extremism and economic failure. The atmosphere was tense in the country labeled the cradle of the 2011 Arab Spring: Over 70,000 members of security forces and heavily armored trucks patrolled the main streets, amid threat of attack from terror groups. More than 5 million people, about half the population, registered to vote. They are set to choose among thousands of candidates vying for 217 seats in the People's Assembly, the country's first permanent legislature since the  2011 popular uprising which ousted President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali. More than 100 political parties are running. The two front-runners are the Islamist Ennahda party, which headed up a transitional coalition government before being forced to give up power earlier this year, and Nidaa Tounes, a secular group led by a former Ben Ali parliament speaker. The two offer widely different visions of Tunisia. Their respective popularity highlights the political polarization that has slowed down real change in the country. Despite the security fears, by mid-morning long lines of people queued to cast their ballots in downtown Tunis' Lafayette district, home to one of the capital's main voting centers. Tunisia's rising unemployment and trend of jihadism were the main topics being enthusiastically discussed by voters as they waited. ""Today is vital so that we do not witness what we just went through in the last three years. Everything got worse after the revolution: security, economy, social problems,"" said Fathy Baklouti, who was voting for Nidaa Tounes. He criticized by the Islamists for being ""old regime"" because of their leader's Ben Ali-era political appointments. The 61-year-old mechanic said the last three years had hit the youth the hardest and he had struggled to help his children find work. The youth unemployment rate here is over 40%. Since the revolution, the number of people under the poverty line has doubled while the corrupt practices that marked the old regime are still prevalent, crushing the economy. ""I pushed my kids into odd jobs like construction work just to protect them from any Salafi brainwashing, which is worryingly prevalent here. The youngsters are particularly vulnerable as they are seduced by money and the promise of having a greater 'purpose,'"" he said, adding that a strong secular leadership -- headed up by Nidaa Tounes -- will help combat radical Islamism. (The Salafists are ultra-conservative Sunni Muslims who are becoming an increasingly strident political force across the Arab world in the wake of the Arab Spring.) Tunisia is lauded as the sole success story of the Arab Spring but in recent years has been struggling to fight a rising insurgency anchored in its rural and border areas. Over 3,000 Tunisians have travelled to Syria to fight with extremist groups like ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, and al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra -- making Tunisia the single largest contributor of foreign fighters. There are whole neighborhoods in Tunis where heads of the more extreme Salafi mosques have persuaded young people to become extremist militants both in Tunisia and abroad. On Friday, the run-up to the elections was marred by a deadly standoff between police and suspected militants in Oued Ellil, a northern suburb of Tunis. Seven people were killed, including five women and a police officer, after a special forces unit raided a home housing ""terrorists,"" according to the Ministry of Interior. At polling stations, people said they hoped the country's political leadership could rally together to stabilize Tunisia and stop it from descending into chaos like neighboring Arab Spring country Libya. ""All must come together, not one person or party can lead Tunisia in its next journey,"" said Mahouba Ettiss, 44, a civil servant voting in downtown Tunis. ""We must have consensus, we must be united or face the consequences.""","Tunisia could offer ""powerful signal"" that democracy can work in the Arab world, analyst says .

"My Dad is the bravest man I've ever known. The first time I remember thinking this was around the age of 4 when I found myself suddenly trapped in the middle of a horrific dog fight. My Dad charged right into the center of the gnashing teeth, grabbed me and lifted me to safety on the hood of a nearby car. When you're 4, that's a heroic act worthy of some kind of medal. I think I probably drew him a picture of one. It was only later that I learned my Dad didn't need a picture. He had the real thing. I was reminded of this as I watched, with quite a bit of emotion, the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of D-Day on Friday. Remember the heroes, one of the commentators said. Remember them, for there are so few left. And soon they will all be gone. Milton Bass volunteered for the Army at 19 and landed in France three months after D-Day with the 104th Infantry Division, known as the Timberwolves. Though he had the skills of a certified sharpshooter, he had decided to become a medic and wore a helmet with a red cross on it. Shortly after arrival in France, his unit was ushered to the front lines. As some members of his group were attempting to clear a large enemy minefield, one misstep set off an explosion that left several lying, badly injured, in the middle of the deadly devices. The sergeant asked for volunteers to go and rescue them. My Dad raised his hand. He's never given us a detailed play-by-play of how he and a couple of his fellow soldiers maneuvered around those mines and picked up those men and got them safely out of there. But it's all spelled out on the certificate that accompanied his Silver Star, the third highest U.S. military decoration for valor. The official description of it notes that the Silver Star is awarded for ""gallantry in action."" It describes my Dad's life to a T. Seventy years ago this fall, as the 104th moved toward Germany, my Dad was witness to all the atrocities of war. But nothing like what he saw once he got there in the spring of 1945. Our generation knows the Holocaust only from pictures and film. But my Dad and his company experienced it firsthand. They were the liberators of the Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp at Nordhausen. It's not the most famous, but it's certainly among the most ghastly. Here's a description from the website JewishGen.org: . ""Nordhausen was liberated by the 104th U.S. Infantry Division on April 12th, 1945. When the first American G.I.'s arrived in the camp, they discovered a gruesome scene. More than 3,000 corpses were scattered, helter-skelter on the grounds. In several hangars there were no survivors and in others they found only 2 or 3 living inmates lying amongst dozens of corpses. The situation was so calamitous that the medic unit of the 104th Infantry Division had to request urgent medical reinforcements and supplies. More than 400 German civilians living in the direct vicinity of the camp were forced by the G.I.'s to evacuate the corpses. The medic units of the 104th Division did the best they could to save as many prisoners as possible, but even with the excellent care they received, numerous inmates died in the hours and days following the liberation of the camps."" My Dad never talked much about this experience when we were younger, though we've learned more about it as my children and my sisters' children have done school projects and interviewed their grandfather about World War II. Still, as he spared us, he also protected them from the most horrific details. He did do an interview once where he described some of what he saw and felt on that terrible day. Two things from it jumped out at me then and stick with me now. First, his recollection of the ""smell of death"" all around him. And second, his still hearing in his head the voices of the local German guards and residents, sickly pleading for mercy with their constant cries of ""Nicht wissen! Nicht wissen!"" -- ""We didn't know!"" ""They knew,"" my Dad said. ""They knew."" My father turned 91 in January. He tends to doze a lot, but he can still be the funniest guy in the room when he wants to be. His grandchildren and pretty much everyone else refer to him affectionately as ""Miltie."" In the wake of the D-Day celebrations and in advance of this Sunday's festivities for fathers everywhere, I'd like to call him ""hero."" Happy Father's Day, Dad.

"Here's a look at some of the techniques the CIA used to interrogate detainees that were included in a Senate Intelligence Committee report released Tuesday. 1. The CIA conducted at least two mock executions -- among other techniques that went unreported in the agency's cables. Others included ""nudity, dietary manipulation, exposure to cold temperatures, cold showers,"" and rough takedowns. In another passage, the mock executions are included in a section that also mentions techniques like ""placing pressure on a detainee's artery ... blowing cigarette or cigar smoke into a detainee's face, using cold water to interrogate detainees, and subjecting a detainee to a 'hard takedown.'"" 2. Those ""rough"" or ""hard"" takedowns involved CIA officers rushing into a detainee's cell, stripping him naked and running him up and down a long hall while slapping and punching him. ""As they ran him along the corridor, a couple of times he fell and they dragged him through the dirt,"" the report says. 3. The CIA often used sleep deprivation, which ""involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours, usually standing or in stress positions, at times with their hands shackled above their heads."" 4. The CIA decided that interrogating Abu Zubaydah would take precedence over his medical care. He almost died as a result of waterboarding. In at least one waterboarding session, Abu Zubaydah ""became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth."" He remained unresponsive until medical intervention, when he regained consciousness and expelled ""copious amounts of liquid."" 5. The first prisoner at the COBALT detention facility, Redha al-Najar, was kept in ""isolation in total darkness."" The CIA gave him increasingly worse food, kept him in uncomfortably cold temperatures, kept him shackled and hooded and played music 24 hours a day. He wore a diaper and had no access to toilets. And he was described as being left hanging -- with one or both wrists handcuffed to an overhead bar so he couldn't lower his arms -- for 22 hours a day for two straight days in an attempt to ""'break' his resistance."" 6. The CIA threatened the families of detainees. It used that prisoner's ""fear for the well-being of his family to our benefit,"" according to the report, by ""using 'vague threats' to create a 'mind virus.'"" In another section, the report says ""CIA officers also threatened at least three detainees with harm to their families -- to include threats to harm the children of a detainee, threats to sexually abuse the mother of a detainee and a threat to 'cut [a detainee's] mother's throat.'"" 7. One detainee faced particularly rough treatment in late 2005. Per the report: ""According to CIA records, Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi was subjected to nudity, dietary manipulation, insult slaps, abdominal slaps, attention grasps, facial holds, walling, stress positions and water dousing with 44 degree Fahrenheit water for 18 minutes. He was shackled in the standing position for 54 hours as part of sleep deprivation, and experienced swelling in his lower legs requiring blood thinner and spiral ace bandages. ""He was moved to a sitting position, and his sleep deprivation was extended to 78 hours. After the swelling subsided, he was provided with more blood thinner and was returned to the standing position. The sleep deprivation was extended to 102 hours. After four hours of sleep, Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi was subjected to an additional 52 hours of sleep deprivation, after which CIA Headquarters informed interrogators that eight hours was the minimum rest period between sleep deprivation sessions exceeding 48 hours. In addition to the swelling, Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi also experienced an edema on his head due to walling, abrasions on his neck and blisters on his ankles from shackles."" 8. ""At least five CIA detainees were subjected to 'rectal rehydration' or rectal feeding without documented medical necessity,"" the report said. More specifically, ""Majid Khan's 'lunch tray' of hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts and raisins was 'pureed' and rectally infused."" 9. The CIA officers involved in the detention and interrogation program weren't the most savory bunch. The group ""included individuals who, among other issues, had engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations, had workplace anger management issues and had reportedly admitted to sexual assault,"" the report said. 10. Some of those who were interrogated didn't have the best thought-out plans. After reading a satirical web story called ""How to Make an H-bomb,"" U.S. citizen Jose Padilla and his associate, Binyam Mohammed, conceived the ""Dirty Bomb Plot."" The report says: ""The article instructed would-be bomb makers to enrich uranium by placing it ""in a bucket, attaching it to a six-foot rope, and swinging it around your head as fast as possible for 45 minutes. Padilla and Mohammed approached Abu Zubaydah in early 2002, and later [Khalid Sheikh Mohammed], with their idea to build and use this device in the United States. ""Neither Abu Zubaydah nor KSM believed the plan was viable, but KSM provided funding for, and tasked Padilla to conduct, an operation using natural gas to create explosions in tall buildings in the United States, later known as the 'Tall Buildings Plot.'""","The Senate Intelligence Committee released its report on torture Tuesday .

"London (CNN) -- The release of a massive report on torture Tuesday by the Senate Intelligence Committee has been accompanied by a strong statement by President Obama, who notes that it describes in detail ""a troubling program involving enhanced interrogation techniques in secret facilities outside the United States"" by operatives working for the CIA. This report -- we're talking about nearly 500 pages summarizing more than 6,000 pages of data and analysis -- will certainly refocus the world's attention on this sordid phase in recent American history. Obama acknowledged that his predecessors in the White House faced ""agonizing choices"" after 9/11, and they acted in ways meant to protect against future attacks by al Qaeda. Still, this new accounting of that period has raised protests from politicians on both sides of the aisle, but especially Republicans, who don't want to drag up painful memories of the Bush administration -- not in this, their finest hour. But it has also raised many questions demanding answers. I'm in London as I write this, and there is already a great deal of talk about this report in the press. Indeed, for many, troubling questions arise: . How could Americans have allowed their government to fly prisoners suspected of terrorist connections to ""black sites"" in Thailand, Morocco, and Poland, where, as the report describes, they were hideously tortured in the hopes of extracting information from them about future plots against the homeland? (And people did know that something like this could be going on, as reporters often described the existence of shadowy rendition programs without knowing the specific details.) Is this how tax dollars were best spent to protect Americans against future threats? Other questions swirl, but one seems especially relevant as we continue our necessary efforts to combat terrorism: Is torture an effective technique for getting reliable information? The report reviews 20 prominent cases that had been brought forth -- by intelligence officials and even alluded to by former President George W. Bush -- as examples of torture that worked, It concludes that none of this brutality resulted in useful information. This corresponds to what experts have suggested all along: Torture simply doesn't work and may actually be counterproductive in the fight against terrorism. The problem isn't with those who actually possess relevant information, it's with those who don't. Men being tortured will saying anything to stop the interrogator from drowning him or abusing him -- and some of the methods detailed in this report are truly horrific. Top intelligence and military officials clearly warned the government as early as 2002 that this brutality doesn't work. In fact, torture generates ""unreliable information,"" as this report affirms; it produces information that requires fact-checking that soon produces more misinformation. As Lou Dimarco observed in 2006, in a useful book about the practice of torture during the Algerian War (1954-1962): ""History offers no modern examples of the strategic effectiveness of harsh interrogation techniques, but it is replete with examples of the negative strategic effects such techniques have on the counterinsurgency force."" There is the additional problem that American enemies can use the fact that we have tortured prisoners as an excuse to torture American captives. Indeed, one can't help but wonder if the fury unleashed by ISIS in Syria and Iraq has its origins at least partially in the dark history of American torture. As the poet W.H. Auden so memorably wrote: ""Those to whom evil is done / Do evil in return."" A truly democratic society depends on the rule of law and respect for human rights; it is the most important baseline we have. When a nation gives in to illegality and brutality -- and torture is both -- it is degrading itself, opening doors and windows that will never be easily closed. Hitler and Stalin were famous for their methods. The United States must set a better example. In one of his first acts as chief executive in 2009, President Obama outlawed secret renditions and torture. This bold declaration was widely seen as a move that helped to restore the moral authority of the United States, which had badly suffered under the presidency of George W. Bush. Unfortunately, the Senate report is not the sort of thing most Americans will ever read, and already there has been a backlash by those who regard its publication as a partisan political move. No doubt they would rather spend their time and money on investigating what happened in 2012 in Benghazi, Libya, and how it came to be that Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was given some erroneous ""talking points"" before she went on Sunday morning talk shows to discuss the attack, that killed four Americans. I wish both Republican and Democrats could see that information like the Senate report is the lifeblood of American democracy. Transparency is all. This admission of torture will surely rile many in the Middle East and elsewhere. But isn't it ultimately a good thing for other countries to see that we hold ourselves to high standards of self-examination? We make mistakes, as all countries do. But we admit our mistakes. One last thing to consider: The new report confirms that President Bush was not directly briefed about the harshest techniques of torture before 2006, although Vice President Dick Cheney apparently attended meetings where these were discussed. So the question remains about whether we should actually try to punish those in the U.S. government who authorized or committed these repulsive and unlawful acts of torture. I would tend to agree with Anthony D. Romero of the American Civil Liberties Union, who wrote an article in The New York Times suggesting that however much the idea of torture turns his stomach, it's better for President Obama to pardon Bush and Cheney for these (my words) crimes against humanity. They will, of course, never be prosecuted anyway. But by granting them pardons, Obama would -- symbolically -- show the world that we recognize that torture is illegal as well as reprehensible, and those who authorized it ""were indeed criminals.""","Jay Parini: Senate report on torture raises troubling questions and controversy .

"The D-E-F-I-N-I-T-I-O-N of a good spelling bee may have forever changed in Missouri. It took seventh grader Kush Sharma more than 90 rounds and two days -- separated by about two weeks -- to finally get the winning word. He beat fifth grader Sophia Hoffman, who went out on the word ""stifling,"" earning a spot in the Scripps National Spelling Bee. The two met February 22 at the Kansas City Public Library for the regularly scheduled competition, where they exhausted all the words on a list provided to the judges. After more than 60 rounds, the match was halted without a winner. ""We didn't want to just go through the dictionary and give them more words,"" Mary Olive Thompson, outreach coordinator for Kansas City Public Library, said at the time. ""We feared that someone would get a word that was too easy while the other would get an extremely difficult word. We wanted to be a bit more calculated and neutral, and we wanted to give each an equal opportunity."" But soon, Kush and Sophia were more than two young, ace spellers from Kansas City. They were national celebrities, appearing on CNN and ABC's ""Good Morning America."" That made Saturday's rematch all that much bigger. The library couldn't contain those who came to watch and ended up setting up a live video stream so that about 100 spectators could watch from the lobby, Thompson said. And this might not be the last time Kush and Sophia duel in the spelling arena. As Thompson noted, ""both students are young enough -- they could face each other again"" next year. Until then, the event's organizers are celebrating what was a riveting, historic and -- in the end -- emotional edition of this year's bee. ""We got to know the kids; they are both great kids,"" Thompson said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Protesting members of the controversial Westboro Baptist Church were met with an unlikely group of counter-protesters Monday at Arlington National Cemetery. Hours before President Barack Obama led the nation's Memorial Day observances at the Tomb of the Unknowns, three members of the Westboro Baptist Church were challenged by others who disagreed with them -- including members claiming to be from the Ku Klux Klan. The Kansas-based church has attracted nationwide attention for its angry, anti-gay protests at the funerals of U.S. military members. Among those counter-protesting at the cemetery's main entrance: About 10 members of a group that claims to be a branch of the Ku Klux Klan from Virginia called the Knights of the Southern Cross. They were cordoned off separately in a nearby area, but drew little attention as they gave out small American flags behind a banner that read ""POW-MIA."" They said they were there to object to the Westboro Baptist Church's anti-troop message. ""It's the soldier that fought and died and gave them that right to free speech,"" said Dennis LaBonte, the self-described ""Imperial Wizard"" of the KKK group that he said he formed several years ago. ""That's fine,"" said Abigail Phelps, the daughter of Westboro Baptist Church founder Fred Phelps. ""They have no moral authority on anything. ""People like them say it's white power ... white supremacy,"" Phelps said. ""The Bible doesn't say anywhere that it's an abomination to be born of a certain gender or race."" LaBonte insisted he is not a racist nor a ""hate-monger,"" but said he believes the white race is ""slowly and most assuredly being denigrated."" Members of the group declined to say whether they were armed. A larger group of about 70 protesters -- separate from the KKK -- located across the street waved pro-USA signs and took turns shouting down the Westboro Baptist Church group. Some of the counter-protesters, including Malaika Elias, stood in front of the Westboro participants in an attempt to block them from street view. ""I think they're twisted and confused, and we're just here to show them there are people who think they're completely wrong,"" Elias said. Many passersby shouted their thanks to the counter-protesters as they entered the cemetery on foot and in vehicles. Several police officers, some on horseback, observed the proceedings. Phelps said her trio was there to tell people they should not ""idolize"" the dead, especially those who died for an ""unrighteous cause.""","Kansas group has 3 people at cemetery, saying dead should not be idolized .

"(CNN)A Korean Air executive has resigned from some of her duties after she ordered a flight to be turned around to the gate and a flight attendant off the plane because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate. Heather Cho, whose Korean name is Cho Hyun-ah, resigned Tuesday from the airline's catering and in-flight sales business, and its cabin service and hotel business divisions, an airline spokesman said. But she is keeping her title as a vice president of the national carrier, he said. As for the next steps, the spokesman told CNN there is an investigation going on, so ""we will have to see."" The incident occurred Friday at New York's JFK airport on a flight due to take off for the South Korean city of Incheon. Cho reportedly demanded that the plane go back to the gate so the crew member who served her macadamia nuts out of a bag rather than on a plate in First Class could be kicked off the flight. Although her role put her in charge of in-flight service, she was only a passenger on this flight and was not flying in an official capacity. According to South Korean news agency Yonhap, Cho is the eldest daughter of Korean Air's chairman, Cho Yang-ho. He apologized Tuesday for any inconvenience caused to passengers and said the incident would be investigated, the news agency reported. Korean Air also issued an apology on Heather Cho's behalf, Yonhap reported, in which she asked for forgiveness. ""I will take full responsibility for the incident and step down from my post,"" she is quoted as saying. Korean Air apologized for any discomfort to those on the flight and said there had been no safety issues involved. The plane arrived at its destination only 11 minutes behind schedule, according to Yonhap. ""Even though it was not an emergency situation, backing up the plane to order an employee to deplane was an excessive act,"" the airline said in a statement. ""We will re-educate all our employees to make sure service within the plane meets high standards."" According to her biography on the website of Nanyang Technological University, Heather Cho joined the airline in 1999 and has since been ""actively involved in establishing a new corporate identity for Korean Air."" She studied at Cornell University and the University of Southern California. CNN's June-eun in Seoul, Elizabeth Joseph in Hong Kong and Larry Register in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Heather Cho asks for forgiveness, says she takes full responsibility, airline says .

"An Indonesian maid has told a Hong Kong court that she was tortured for six months by her former employer, who shoved a vacuum cleaner tube into her mouth, tearing her mouth. In two days of disturbing testimony, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, a 23-year-old domestic helper, said through an interpreter she endured all sorts of abuse, including being punched, slapped, kicked and beaten unconscious. The case sparked international outrage when gruesome images of her injuries surfaced earlier this year and she was admitted to a hospital in Indonesia in critical condition. Erwiana's former employer Law Wan-tung, a 44-year-old housewife, faces 21 charges, including inflicting grievous bodily harm, assault and criminal intimidation. Law pleaded not guilty to all charges, except one, for failing to take out an insurance policy for an employee. Stripped naked . Speaking calmly, Erwiana described an incident when she said she was punished for dozing off during work. ""I was taken to the bathroom and she took off all my clothes and she sprayed cold water on me,"" she said. She said she was not allowed to put her clothes back on, and her employer switched on an electric fan and pointed it at her for hours before she was allowed to dress herself. Prosecutors accused Law, a mother of two, of using a mop, ruler, and coat hangers to beat Erwiana and also pulled her down from a ladder while she was cleaning. Erwiana said on one occasion she was beaten unconscious, and after she came to, her employer forced her back to work. ""She often punched my eyes and I was shocked. And she kept on punching and punching me,"" says Erwiana. Erwiana said she was forced to work for 20 hours a day, and was only allowed to sleep between 1 p.m to 5 p.m. ""I had to sleep on the floor,"" says Erwiana. All she was given to eat was three to six pieces of bread and a bowl of rice each day. Call for justice . Several migrant rights activist groups rallied outside the Wanchai District Court on Monday, calling for justice for Erwiana. The case also involves charges of assault on two other Indonesian domestic helpers, Tutik Lestari Ningsih and Nurhasanah, who were under Law's previous employ. She could face up to seven years of imprisonment for the charges of causing grievous bodily harm, the maximum term the District Court can sentence. In January, thousands of people marched to the streets in support of the allegedly abused young Indonesian worker.Amnesty International issued a public statement in June urging the Hong Kong government to take immediate action to ""end the widespread abuse and exploitation of migrant domestic workers."" According to a report released last year, Indonesian migrant workers are at risk of serious human rights violations in Hong Kong.Hong Kong employs some 320,000 foreign domestic workers mainly from Indonesia, Philippines and from other parts of Asia.READ MORE: Indonesian migrant worker tells of abuse as thousands protest in Hong Kong .","Indonesian domestic helper testifies before a Hong Kong court .

"The joint industrial park, one of the key symbols of cooperation between North and South Korea, re-opened Monday after a five-month hiatus. South Korean vehicles and freight trucks waited in traffic as they prepared to cross through customs and immigration into the North Korean city of Kaesong, where the industrial park sits. Activity at the Kaesong Industrial Complex ground to a halt in April amid mounting tensions between the two neighbors. As tensions eased, intense negotiations to re-open the complex resumed after several false starts. Choi Dong-jin, a South Korean who operates a jeans factory at Kaesong, expressed his relief as the shutters were finally lifted. ""Words cannot describe how happy we were after we heard the news,"" Choi said. All 123 companies operating in the zone experienced heavy losses after Kaesong's closure, and in Choi's case, the figure amounted to US$3 million. ""I've invested all of my capital in Kaesong. After the shutdown, we couldn't do any business,"" he told CNN from the small office in Seoul he'd been forced to operate from since April. The Kaesong Industrial Complex, which is considered to be an important source of hard currency for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime, sits just a few kilometers north of the DMZ, which divides the two Koreas. Its closure followed a sustained escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula, set off by North Korea's long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test in February. The subsequent tightening of sanctions announced by the U.N. Security Council resulted in increasingly menacing rhetoric from the North, who threatened to attack the South with a pre-emptive nuclear strike. With South Korean workers and supplies barred from entering the region, the last remaining workers left Kaesong in May. ""The unexpected event happened and we couldn't keep our promises to our clients,"" Choi recalled. ""We had our own losses, but the clients had their losses too. There was no contingency plan."" After several offers from Seoul to end the impasse, the two Koreas finally agreed to reopen Kaesong last week with an agreement that the industrial zone's operations would no longer be ""affected by political situations under any circumstances."" But for some of the affected businesses, the damage may be difficult to reverse. ""Yes it is going to re-open, but the question is 'how long will it take to recover our company's credibility from the client?' Until we gain back their trust again, they won't request a large order,"" Choi said. After it was opened in 2005, about US$2 billion worth of goods have been produced at Kaesong, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry, making it important to the North's ailing economy in particular. North Korean workers there earn an average of $134 per month, 45% of which are taken by North Korean authorities for various taxes.","Kaesong Industrial Complex reopens Monday after five-month closure .

"Washington (CNN)Sen. Elizabeth Warren may repeatedly say she isn't running for president in 2016, but don't tell that to the nation's largest liberal grassroots organization. MoveOn.org, an 8-million member liberal grassroots organization, is poised to kick off a $1 million campaign to draft Warren for president in 2016. The plan will be put to MoveOn members Tuesday morning, but because of the Massachusetts senator's popularity with the liberals, the plan is expected to easily pass. The campaign includes MoveOn.org opening offices and hiring staff in Iowa and New Hampshire, two states that are critically important in the presidential nomination process, and ""the assembly of a national volunteer army ready to go to work if Sen. Warren enters the race."" If passed, MoveOn will also begin producing ""ads and media products that call attention to how Sen. Warren has stood up and fought for the middle class and her powerful vision for our country's future."" ""There is too much at stake to have anything other than our best candidates in the debate,"" Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action, said in a statement. ""We are prepared to show Senator Warren she has the support she needs to enter—and win—the presidential race."" Warren has said a number of times that she is not running for president, despite all the liberal excitement around her possible candidacy. Through her lawyer, Warren even disavowed Ready for Warren, a super PAC hoping to draft the liberal senator. ""As Senator Warren has said many times, she is not running for president,"" Lacey J. Rose, Warren's press secretary, said on Tuesday. That said, should she decide to run, Warren would be far from the first presidential hopeful to backtrack on a pledge not to do so. ""This is a huge opportunity for MoveOn members, if they choose, to inspire Senator Warren as she has inspired so many of us,"" said Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org Civic Action. MoveOn's campaign is as much a boost to Warren as it is a slight to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner for the 2016 nomination and someone who has failed to connect with some liberal activists. MoveOn organizers won't fault Clinton directly, but they regularly talk about finding a nominee that fits the moment for Democrats, not someone associated with what they see as a longtime rigged political system. Polling, however, has shown that self-identified liberals overwhelmingly back the former secretary of state. In a July CNN/ORC International Poll, 66% of liberals said they would back Clinton over people like Warren, Vice President Joe Biden and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. In the same poll, only 13% of liberal backed Warren. But in polls of strictly members of liberal groups, Warren fares much better. In a November poll of Democracy for America's one million members, Warren garnered 42% support, compared to 24% for Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders and 23% for Clinton. MoveOn is not the only liberal political group pushing for a Warren run. Democracy for America said Tuesday it would poll its members about joining the ""Draft Warren"" effort. ""Washington consultants can spout off a dozen reasons why Elizabeth Warren shouldn't run, but none of that beltway blather means a thing next to this one, simple truth: The Democratic Party and our country desperately need Warren's voice in the 2016 presidential debate,"" DFA Executive Director Charles Chamberlain said in a statement out Tuesday.","MoveOn.org is a liberal grassroots advocacy group with 8 million members .
There's a vote Tuesday on whether to back a campaign to draft Elizabeth Warren for 2016 .

"Johannesburg (CNN)The wife of slain South African hostage Pierre Korkie has said she chooses to forgive those who caused his death during a botched rescue attempt in Yemen. ""Today we are here to choose,"" Yolande Korkie said Tuesday. ""To choose to forgive those that caused Pierre's death. What will it help to accuse? What will it help to find out what happened? Will it bring Pierre back? We choose to let it go,"" she said. Pierre Korkie was killed Friday in Yemen when the U.S. military launched a failed raid to rescue another hostage,  American photojournalist Luke Somers, who also was killed. Yolande Korkie said ""all is God's will"" as she discussed the failed U.S. military mission. She expressed her gratitude to the United States for bringing her husband's remains home and was philosophical when asked about regrets. ""We have lost, but one can never regret when you have lived with people that have nothing,"" she said. She also thanked South Africans for the ""voice of prayer"" that went up for her husband's safe release, even if those prayers were not answered in the way they and the family wanted. Growing emotional, she said: ""I had visualized something different, we had visualized him holding us in his arms, and hearing his soft voice. ""But this morning, when we arrived, there was immense relief that this suffering for him was finished. ... We may not have him physically, but in our hearts, he will never die."" He has been an amazing husband and an amazing father to his two children, she said. Yolande and Pierre Korkie were kidnapped in Yemen's Taiz province in May of last year, the nongovernmental organization Gift of the Givers said. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula freed Yolande Korkie in January, after negotiations with Gift of the Givers, and was to release her husband Sunday, the group said on its site. CNN's Brent Swails reported from Johannesburg, and Richard Allen Green wrote from London.","Yolande Korkie says she feels immense relief now that her husband's suffering is over .

"(CNN)It should have been a peaceful, contemplative night for Levi Rosenblat, studying the Torah inside a Brooklyn synagogue. But that peace was shattered when an intruder came into the Chabad-Lubavitch World Headquarters, stabbing Rosenblat on the left side of his head. There would be no other victims, however. New York police officers quickly arrived at the scene and -- after a verbal back-and-forth captured on video -- shot and killed the attacker. Hours later, Rosenblat -- the 22-year-old student from Israel -- was in stable condition at Brooklyn's Kings County Hospital. And authorities were trying to piece together what happened and why. At a brief news conference Tuesday, the NYPD's John Miller described what happened as an ""isolated incident"" carried out by a 49-year-old man well known to police. ""At this point, (this) appears to involve an individual who ... has a history of being an emotionally disturbed person and acting out in other places,"" Miller said. Jews in the United States and elsewhere -- including Israel, the site of several recent stabbings -- have been targeted before. Noting that at least one witness heard an ""anti-Jewish comment,"" New York police Commissioner William Bratton said that his department's hate crimes unit is investigating. Rabbi Motti Seligson, a spokesman for the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, said that, ""According to witnesses, (the attacker) was overheard saying repeatedly, 'Kill the Jews' or something to that effect."" Yet that wasn't the only thing the suspect said, nor is it the only thing that authorities are factoring in during their investigation. One witness said the attacker ""sounded really high or on drugs"" or mentally unstable. As Bratton said, ""The motive at this time time: We don't know."" Studying at prominent Jewish center . Describing itself as ""a philosophy, a movement and an organization,"" Chabad-Lubavitch dates back 250 years to Russia. It has since evolved into one of the most high-profile educational, outreach and community arms of Orthodox Judaism, operating hundreds of centers worldwide, including more than 1,000 in the United States alone. Its headquarters in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood lies at the center of it all. That's where Rosenblat was around 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, studying the Torah in a synagogue that's part of Chabad-Lubavitch World Headquarters. ""This ... is a place where everybody is welcome,"" said a man who happened to walk into the synagogue at the same time as the attacker. The man, who was delivering food, asked to be identified only as Israel. ""Nobody would even look at you no matter how you look, how you sound, how act."" Israel said the attacker came in with his hands in his pockets, but was soon waving a knife and saying various things such as ""he wants his Bible, (then) another minute he was saying that he wants to kill people."" These words and antics set most at the still-busy center on guard, but Rosenblat didn't seem to notice. ""Unfortunately, (Rosenblat) wasn't aware of what (the attacker) was doing,"" Israel said. ""He was busy with a (holy book)."" Israel described the scene as very chaotic, right up until a New York police officer stationed at a nearby command post learned what was happening and came to the scene. He found the suspect holding a 9-inch knife with a 4½-inch blade. Yelling, then a single gunshot . A cell phone video -- taken by Israel -- showed what happened next. ""Throw it, just throw it,"" an officer is heard saying about the knife. He then urges the attacker to step away from the tossed knife and put his hands up. The man initially complies, then slowly walks back toward the weapon. ""Whoa, whoa, whoa!"" someone yells out. An officer yells out again, ""Stay away from me"" -- but it doesn't stop the man from lunging for, and picking up, the knife he'd briefly dropped. The man then starts running toward police, saying, ""Are you going to arrest me?"" Police officers -- as, by then, there were three at the scene -- can be heard yelling as well. ""Drop the (expletive) knife! Drop the (expletive) knife!"" Then comes a gunshot. Police keep up, pointing guns toward the now-downed man and telling him to drop the knife and not to move. ""Stay down! Stay down!"" one officer yells. Increased police presence at 'houses of worship' The 49-year-old was shot in the torso, according to police. Officers continued to tell him not to move as they handcuffed him in between the synagogue's books and desks. An ambulance took him to Kings County Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The officer who shot him and two other officers were sent to Brooklyn's Methodist Hospital for treatment of tinnitus, which is a noise or ringing in the ears. This officer-involved death comes at a time of emotional protests over a grand jury's decision not to indict New York police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner. That incident got a lot of attention in part because it was captured on video. Israel said he recorded what happened at the synagogue, and made it public, to document it and leave no doubt about what transpired. ""People should at least see this is happening for a reason,"" Israel said of police shooting the suspect. ""People actually do crime."" No one is saying this attack is part of any larger plot, and Bratton said police aren't calling it a terrorist attack. Still, given that the news may cause concerns at ""houses of worship around the city, our critical incident response vehicles ... will focus on religious institutions in part today,"" the NYPD's Miller said. ""So you will see some enhanced coverage in terms of police presence at locations,"" Miller added. ""But I want to underline that is to really address those concerns while we sort through the details here, not to suggest that ... this had any connection to anything other than this individual and his problems at this time."" CNN's Tina Burnside in Atlanta and Amir Tal in Jerusalem contributed to this report.","Witness says most were on guard for an attack, but the victim didn't seem aware .

"(CNN) -- When Rachel Frederickson won season 15 of ""The Biggest Loser"" in February, her new look was met with more criticism than praise. After shedding 155 pounds, the 24-year-old voiceover artist received backlash from fans who thought she looked unhealthy. Now heavier, Frederickson has penned an essay for Today's ""2014 Voices"" section to address the controversy. Frederickson explains that she moved to Germany at a young age after falling in love with a foreign exchange student. That relationship turned unhealthy, she said, and ""It didn't take long before the voice of a boy I loved started diminishing my self-esteem. His voice told me I wasn't enough and I believed it. I started listening to a louder voice than my own, and in turn, I lost the person I loved being."" Appearing on the show, she said, was where she ""learned that my voice had to be stronger than everyone else's."" ""From the beginning, no one thought I would make it to the final three and dismissed me as a finalist that could actually win,"" Frederickson said. ""But I was there to get my life back."" Some deemed her dramatic transformation from 260 pounds to 105 pounds too drastic, and Frederickson felt the pressure of the disapproval. ""Comments during the controversial storm following my weight loss were hurtful. My self-esteem once again was affected by other people's voices -- this time, the kind that live forever in Facebook posts or written in the pages of magazines,"" she wrote. ""People tried to bring me down and (privately) succeeded."" Frederickson, who has revealed that she gained 20 pounds after the finale, said she is now happy, healthy and in a good place.

"Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who survived an attack by the Taliban, on Monday appealed to Boko Haram militants in Nigeria to lay down their weapons and ""stop misusing the name of Islam."" Malala is visiting Nigeria in support of an estimated 276 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram from their school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria on April 14. Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as ""Western education is a sin"" in the local Hausa language, is trying to impose Sharia law across Nigeria and especially opposes the education of women. Malala has been an outspoken supporter of girls' education. In 2012, her views made her the target of the Pakistan Taliban, which tried to assassinate the then-15-year-old as she traveled home from school. She survived and a year later launched the nonprofit Malala Fund, aimed at empowering girls through education. In 2013, the United Nations declared Malala's birthday, July 12, Malala Day as she addressed the U.N. General Assembly in New York. This year she is in Nigeria for Malala Day, which is being celebrated Monday, two days after her 17th birthday. Over the weekend, Malala met some of the schoolgirls who managed to escape Boko Haram and the families of the more than 200 girls still missing. Outrage at the  mass abduction inspired the social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls, with Malala among the global faces photographed holding a sign with the hashtag. She met with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan on Monday in the capital, Abuja. Nigerians and others have accused the government of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect the girls who were abducted from Chibok. But the military has defended its response saying its soldiers have to enforce a state of emergency across Borno state, where Chibok is situated -- an area of more than 90,000 square kilometers (34,750 square miles). After her meeting with Jonathan, CNN asked Malala if he had said whether any progress had been made in finding the girls. ""As you all know, in politics nothing is clear. In the circumstances nothing is clear really, but the President did make promises, and the President said that he feels that these girls are his daughters,"" Malala said. She  added that Jonathan had said he would meet the parents of kidnapped girls and provide support to those who had escaped Boko Haram. Jonathan told Malala that the government ""was definitely doing everything possible to ensure that the girls were rescued alive and safely returned to their parents,"" his office said in a statement. ""Terror is relatively new here and dealing with it has its challenges. The great challenge in rescuing the Chibok girls is the need to ensure that they are rescued alive,"" he said. ""We have had teams from the United States, Britain, France, Israel and other friendly nations working with us here on the rescue effort and they all appreciate the challenges and the need to thread carefully to achieve our purpose."" Jonathan also thanked Malala for ""your efforts to change the world positively through your powerful advocacy for girl-child education,"" the statement said. Malala later gave a speech to mark Malala Day to an audience that included advocates from the #BringBackOurGirls campaign and some of the schoolgirls who had escaped Boko Haram. Malala said she had told the President: ""You need to fulfill your responsibilities."" She also issued an appeal to the militants. ""I ask Boko Haram to stop misusing the name of Islam,"" she said. ""Lay down your weapons, release your sisters, release my sisters and release the daughters of this nation."" A country ""becomes powerful when its people become educated,"" she said. ""Let us not forget that one book, one pen, one child and one teacher can change the world."" In May, Malala told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that women were targeted by those who feared a society in which women are empowered. Malala's activism started after the Taliban banned girls from schools in Pakistan's Swat Valley in 2009. She anonymously blogged for the BBC in opposition to that order and became an open advocate for girls' education. In 2011, Malala told CNN, ""I have the right of education. I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk."" A year later, she was riding the bus home from school when a Taliban gunman climbed aboard and shot her in the head, nearly killing her. Since then, Malala has continued advocating for girls' education despite ongoing death threats from the Taliban.","Malala Yousafzai is in Nigeria in support of more than 200 girls abducted by Boko Haram .

"In a country where bleaching creams are frequently used to chemically lighten skin tone, one savvy entrepreneur is fighting against the disfiguring practice. After 19 years of driving taxis, Alhaji Mustapha Oti Boateng was looking for a change. His journey for a new profession led him to Britain, Japan and ultimately back home to Ghana, where he stumbled into his calling after producing a line of herbal cosmetics. In Ghana, the practice of using creams and other cosmetic products to chemically lighten skin tone is fairly common, as it is in many African countries -- but the practice is known to have detrimental health effects, according to the World Health Organization. Using his deep-rooted knowlege of herbs, Boateng had an idea to help his fellow Ghanaians. Now a household name in the West African region, his Chocho cosmetics has become a popular staple in beauty bags throughout the area. Boateng, who won the Overall Entrepreneur of the Year award bestowed by the Entrepreneurs Foundation of Ghana earlier this year, sat down with CNN to explain how he went from a humble taxi driver to a cosmetics king. CNN: What was your breakout product? Alhaji Mustapha Oti Boateng: I started with Chocho cream -- the natural skin restorer and beauty soap. It is a local soap produced by our forefathers... It's not all types of a disease that a cream can cure, but most of the skin ailments the cream can cure. That is why it's written as a ""natural skin restorer"" -- it doesn't bleach but rather enhances your color. CNN: Where has this knowledge of organic cosmetics come from? AB: My father was a herbalist and my grandfather was a herbalist I tried to recall all those things that when I was young they sent me to the bush to collect. The herbs that we have here have a real potency of curing... and when I started using them too I have realized that I didn't choose the wrong way of curing people. CNN: You had been working as a taxi driver since you dropped out of school. Why the sudden need to mix things up? AB: When I found that my children were growing up, I told [one of my taxi clients] that I had to find something to do so that I would be able to look after my children very well. And he himself told me they needed to send someone to Britain, to go and learn how to operate printing a press. He sent me there, I learned and came back and they opened a printing press for me in Accra. CNN: Then after the printing press, came a stint in Japan... AB: They gave me the opportunity to go and I traveled to Japan where I started odd jobs... I came back with about five buses and started a transport business, but unfortunately for me it was all accidents, one after the other. CNN: After all these accidents, you didn't give up though. You transformed one of the buses into a mobile grocery delivery service, right? AB: What I was doing was going to the villages, buying food stuffs, buying everything needed in the kitchen and coming to the residential areas and announcing the things that I had to sell.  It was a very lucrative job.  I did it for some time and I saw that the work was so tedious because sometimes I had to go to the bush myself, carry the load, uproot the coco yam, cassava, and that stuff by myself and age was catching up with me. So I decided that this work, I can't do it for long because if age caught up with me I can't go to the bush to carry those food stuffs, so I decided to try another thing. CNN: So where did the name ""Chocho"" come from? AB: This name ""Chocho"" is in the memory of a dear friend, who has passed on. That name ""Chocho"" was a nickname between us. CNN: And how did you know organic skin care products would take off the way they did? AB: I went to the market and bought creams that are manufactured and produced by foreign countries, powders and perfumes, and went around announcing those things for sale and it was really doing very well. CNN: So you decided to start producing locally and it's been quite the success. Has it been an easy ride? AB: The economy is always fluctuating. You know we haven't got a permanent exchange rate for our currency. I'm an herbalist, I produce other products but some things, fragrance and petroleum jelly and that sort of stuff.

CNN: You seem to face these obstacles head on and industry leaders have noticed. How did it feel to be honored as the ""Overall Entrepreneur of the Year"" in April? AB: [As] somebody who started from nowhere,  if I am in this area and being recognized that I am the entrepreneur of the year, obviously, I cherish this the most ... it means they are appreciating what I am doing, so I was very happy. CNN: And after receiving these honors, you're also trying the ""pay it forward"" mentality by helping build schools and provide computers in classrooms?

"On Wednesday, three senior U.S. senators sent Michael Lynton, the CEO of Sony Pictures, a letter about ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" the much-discussed new movie about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, which described the film as ""grossly inaccurate and misleading."" In the letter, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, and Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, expressed their ""deep disappointment"" in the movie's depiction of CIA officers torturing prisoners, which ""credits these detainees with providing critical lead information"" about the courier who led the CIA to bin Laden's hiding place in northern Pakistan. The senators point out that the filmmakers of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" open the movie with the words that it is ""based on first-hand accounts of actual events."" The film then goes on, the senators say, to give the clear implication ""that the CIA's coercive interrogation techniques were effective in eliciting important information related to a courier for Usama Bin Laden."" Review: 'Zero Dark Thirty' is utterly gripping . The senators write that this is not supported by the facts: ""We have reviewed CIA records and know that this is incorrect."" Last week, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to sign off on the findings of its three-year study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, during the course of which the committee's staff reviewed more than 6 million pages of records about the program. Based on the findings of that review, Sens. Feinstein and Levin had released a statement eight months ago that said, ""The CIA did not first learn about the existence of the Usama Bin Laden courier from CIA detainees subjected to coercive interrogation techniques. Nor did the CIA discover the courier's identity from detainees subjected to coercive techniques. ... Instead, the CIA learned of the existence of the courier, his true name and location through means unrelated to the CIA detention and interrogation program."" In their letter to Sony, the three senators write, ""(W)ith the release of Zero Dark Thirty, the filmmakers and your production studio are perpetuating the myth that torture is effective. ... We believe that you have an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Usama Bin Laden is not based on the facts."" Requests from Sony Pictures for comment on the senators' letter yielded a response referring to a statement that the film's director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal had released last week: . ""This was a 10-year intelligence operation brought to the screen in a two-and-a-half-hour film. We depicted a variety of controversial practices and intelligence methods that were used in the name of finding bin Laden. The film shows that no single method was necessarily responsible for solving the manhunt, nor can any single scene taken in isolation fairly capture the totality of efforts the film dramatizes. One thing is clear: the single greatest factor in finding the world's most dangerous man was the hard work and dedication of the intelligence professionals who spent years working on this global effort. We encourage people to see the film before characterizing it."" 'Zero Dark Thirty' puts U.S. interrogation back in the spotlight . ""Zero Dark Thirty"" does indeed show many scenes of the various forms of sleuthing at the CIA that were necessary to track down al Qaeda's leader. But the statement from the filmmakers does not address the fact that eight months ago, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee had publicly said that based on an exhaustive investigation, there was no evidence that coercive interrogations helped lead to bin Laden's courier -- which is clearly what the film suggests, no matter what retrospective gloss the filmmakers now wish to apply to the issue. Nor does the statement indicate if Sony plans to put a disclaimer at the beginning of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" explaining that the role of coercive interrogations in tracking down bin Laden that is shown in the film is not supported by the facts. As I outlined in a piece on CNN.com 10 days ago assessing the role that coercive interrogations might have played in the hunt for bin Laden, about half an hour of the start of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" consists of scenes of a bloodied al Qaeda detainee strung to the ceiling with ropes who is beaten; forced to wear a dog collar while crawling around attached to a leash; stripped naked in the presence of a female CIA officer; blasted with heavy metal music so he is deprived of sleep; forced to endure multiple crude waterboardings; and locked into a coffin-like wooden crate. These are the scenes that will linger with filmgoers, far more than the scene in the movie where two CIA analysts discuss what will prove to be a key lead to bin Laden that surfaces in an old file. Brutal interrogations, of course, make for a better movie than a discussion at the office. It is only after systematic abuse by his CIA interrogators in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" that the al Qaeda detainee is tricked into believing that he has already given up key information, and he starts cooperating and tells them about a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, who ultimately proves to be bin Laden's courier. Acting CIA director Michael Morell, in a letter to CIA employees on Friday, took strong exception to this portrayal of how bin Laden was found: . ""The film creates the strong impression that the enhanced interrogation techniques that were part of our former detention and interrogation program were the key to finding Bin Ladin.  That impression is false.  As we have said before, the truth is that multiple streams of intelligence led CIA analysts to conclude that Bin Ladin was hiding in Abbottabad.  Some came from detainees subjected to enhanced techniques, but there were many other sources as well. "" ""Zero Dark Thirty"" opened Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles and will open nationwide in the second week in January. Let's hope that the attention that ""Zero Dark Thirty"" has directed to the issue of what kind of intelligence was derived from the CIA's coercive interrogations will help to put pressure on the White House and the CIA to release to the public as much as possible of the presently classified 6,000-page report by the Senate Intelligence Committee that examines this issue. _____________ . Full disclosure: Along with other national security experts, as an unpaid adviser I screened an early cut of ""Zero Dark Thirty."" We advised that al Qaeda detainees held at secret CIA prison sites overseas were certainly abused, but they were not beaten to a pulp, as was presented in this early cut. Screenwriter Mark Boal told CNN as a result of this critique, some of the bloodier scenes were ""toned down"" in the final cut. I also saw this final cut of the film. Finally, HBO is making a theatrical release documentary which will be out in 2013 based on my book about the hunt for bin Laden entitled ""Manhunt."" Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.","Sens.

"Listening to the White House, it sounds like an adventure movie -- the secret swapping of detained terror suspects for an ailing American soldier captured in Afghanistan. To Congress, it sounds like the same old same old -- the White House ignoring an obligation to let legislators know about the deal ahead of time. In the aftermath of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's weekend release in exchange for five Taliban figures held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, some in Congress allege President Barack Obama broke the law by failing to inform them about the move 30 days in advance -- as called for under the National Defense Authorization Act. ""The law says they are to give us 30 days' notice. If the President thought that was unconstitutional or an invalid law, than he shouldn't have signed the bill,"" said Georgia's Saxby Chambliss, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""He knew very well that he was required by law to give us 30 days' notice and he didn't do it."" Obama told reporters in Poland on Tuesday that the circumstances required an immediate decision within his authority as commander in chief. ""We saw an opportunity"" ""We have consulted with Congress for quite some time about the possibility we may have to execute a prisoner exchange,"" Obama said of past talks involving Bergdahl. ""We saw an opportunity and we were concerned about his health and had cooperation from the Qataris and we seized that. It was truncated to make sure we didn't miss that opportunity."" The issue touches on flashpoints old and new between the administration and its critics, especially conservative Republicans seeking to depict Obama as a weak leader driven by political concerns for his legacy. Foremost is whether the Obama administration actually broke the law by not telling Congress beforehand about the weekend exchange in which Bergdahl got handed over to U.S. military commandos near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border while the five alleged senior terrorism figures were flown to Qatar. Under the National Defense Authorization Act signed into law by Obama late last year, the administration gained some added flexibility in transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay, but was required to notify Congress 30 days in advance. However, legislators had no power to block such a transfer. Writing about the law last year, Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institution said it put the administration ""in a position to move detainees out of Guantanamo as long as it is willing to be politically accountable for the problems they create and as long as they don't bring them to the United States."" ""It was lawful,"" White House says . That is exactly what happened, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden argued Tuesday in a statement. ""Given the credible reports regarding the risk of grave harm to Sergeant Bergdahl and the rapidly unfolding events surrounding his recovery, it was lawful for the administration to proceed with the transfer notwithstanding the notice requirement"" in the NDAA, Hayden said in a statement. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin disagreed, saying Obama ""clearly broke the law"" even if he can provide a legal justification for what he did. The bottom line, to Toobin, was that the law calls for 30 days' notice and Obama didn't do it. Under the law, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel can authorize such a transfer if he ""determines that actions have or will be taken that substantially mitigate the risk that the individual will engage in activity that threatens the United States or U.S. persons or interests,"" or if the transfer ""is in the national security interest of the United States,"" Hayden said. In Poland, Obama noted Tuesday that Qatar provided assurances it would monitor the activities of the five Guantanamo detainees, described as senior terrorist figures. Under the terms of the exchange, the five released Taliban figures can't leave Qatar for a year. ""We will be keeping eyes on them,"" Obama said, noting the possibility existed the freed detainees would continue with terrorist activities but adding ""I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security."" Even more, he contended, the move adhered to a bedrock U.S. value of protecting its own. ""Regardless of the circumstances, whatever those circumstances may turn out to be, we still get an American soldier back if he's held in captivity. Period. Full stop,"" Obama said. ""We don't condition that, and that's what every mom and dad who sees a son or daughter sent over to a war theater should expect from not just their commander in chief but the United States of America."" On the 30-day notification period for Congress, Hayden said the Obama administration determined that such a wait could scuttle the swap and perhaps cost Bergdahl his life. Conflicting responsibilities . She provided a legal explanation, saying the Constitution requires Obama as President and commander in chief to protect the lives of Americans abroad and protect U.S. soldiers, responsibilities that in this case conflicted with the 30-day notification period for Congress. ""We believe it is fair to conclude that Congress did not intend that the administration would be barred from taking the action it did in these circumstances,"" she wrote. Hayden also noted that in signing the NDAA, Obama said the law ""in certain circumstances would violate constitutional separation of powers principles."" ""The executive branch must have the flexibility, among other things, to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers,"" Hayden quoted from Obama's signing statement. Toobin said the signing statement amounts to the President's opinion ""of what the law should mean,"" rather than a legal ruling. ""This is an example of a signing statement where the President is taking power for himself that the law didn't give him,"" Toobin said. ""That may be constitutional, but it is still a violation of what the law says."" To Congress, the exchange irritated an already raw nerve over the never-ending power struggle between the White House and legislators, who accuse every administration of trying to run roughshod over congressional authority. Even an Obama ally like Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California told CNN that as the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, she should have received some advance notice of the swap involving Guantanamo detainees. On Tuesday, Feinstein told reporters that the White House deputy national security adviser, Tony Blinken, called her to apologize for the lack of advance notice. However, it was unclear from Feinstein's comments if Blinken referred to a courtesy call or the 30-day notification under the law. Meanwhile, both Feinstein and House Speaker John Boehner said the White House encountered opposition from top Democrats and Republicans on congressional intelligence committees when it previously discussed the possibility of exchanging Bergdahl for Guantanamo detainees as far back as 2011. ""Given the past briefings and concerns we had addressed -- and these were from both committees and the leadership of both committees; the concerns were bipartisan -- and I strongly believe that we should have been consulted, that the law should have been followed and I very much regret that that was not the case,"" Feinstein said. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, also argued that the past discussions meant legislators expected the Obama administration to brief them again before any exchange took place, adding: ""The only reason it did not is because the administration knew it faced serious and sober bipartisan concern and opposition."" However, another veteran Democrat said the administration took all the proper steps under the circumstances. ""We received a detailed classified notification from the Secretary of Defense that satisfies the many substantive certification requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act,"" said a statement by Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. Noting that Obama ""put Congress on notice"" last December that he intended to act quickly in such cases, ""members of Congress should not be surprised that he acted as he did in the circumstances that existed."" GOP attack strategy . Republicans piled on as part of their strategy to tarnish both the Obama and Democratic brands ahead of November's congressional elections and the 2016 presidential vote. Some GOP committee chairmen in the House already plan for hearings on the legality of the swap, a move backed by Boehner. Chambliss, who is retiring when his current term expires at the end of the year, challenged the administration's explanation that Berhdahl's ill health necessitated moving swiftly to complete the weekend exchange. ""There is no indication of that other than what this President said and I don't believe a thing this President says now,"" he said. Veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona took broader aim on Tuesday, telling Fox News that the Bergdahl swap was part of what he called a misguided policy to get all American troops out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016 -- a timetable Obama announced last week. ""The president may be ending the war in Afghanistan, but the Taliban and al Qaeda are not ending the war in Afghanistan,"" said McCain, a constant critic of any effort by Obama to limit U.S. military presence abroad. Obama, who defeated McCain in the 2008 presidential election, ""is carrying out a foreign policy of unreliability and weakness"" that will cost the nation ""for years to come,"" said the senator, himself a former prisoner of war. Toobin said he expected the controversy to remain in the political arena, noting that the courts rarely if ever get involved in power squabble between the executive and legislative branches. ""This just shows that members of Congress, even Democrats, are very jealous of institutional power,"" he said, ""and that Congress doesn't want to be treated like a doormat, even by a President of the same party.""

"Do you hate your cable company? Is that same company your Internet provider? Or do you pay an outrageous sum for super slow Web access over your phone line? The announcement of yet another megamerger in the telecommunications industry -- this time Comcast is proposing to buy Time Warner Cable in a plan that would merge the country's two largest cable providers -- highlights just how broken and misguided the United States is when it comes to its vital Internet infrastructure. Americans are divided on many issues, but resentment against these telecom giants is so pervasive that it may just be the most heartwarming symbol of national unity. And that's as it should be. Except that the resentment should extend to politicians who have made this disastrous system possible and allow political contributions to prevent them from fixing it. The problem is not just one of dismal customer service. Instead, it is a growing threat to the country's economic and strategic position. If you travel overseas, you will quickly notice that Web access in much of the developed world is light years ahead of America's. You may also be irritated to discover that far better Internet is much, much cheaper in other countries. The average American spends thousands of dollars each year for Internet, phone and cable services. If you live in, say, Lafayette, Louisiana, your best ""triple play"" deal -- cable, Internet and phone -- comes courtesy of Comcast at $121 per month, according to a study by the New America Foundation. That service limps into your house at a rate of 5 Megabits per second (Mbps). If you lived in Seoul, South Korea, you could buy the same three-service bundle blazing at 100 Mbps -- 20 times faster -- for just $35. Or you could pay just $15 a month for a modest 8 Mbps, still a huge improvement in speed at a small fraction of the cost. How much do you pay? Does it feel like you're being robbed? The problem is that telecommunications services are coming from an ever-smaller number of companies with very little genuine competition. And the way the system is structured, those companies have practically no incentive to build a fast Internet. Why would Comcast invest in fast fiber networks when it already controls most of the market? In fact, if Comcast provided faster Internet service, it might jeopardize its own cable business by making alternatives such as Netflix and Hulu more appealing. Already there are reports that Comcast is trying to keep its competitor Netflix in check. Verizon, incidentally, started building a fiber optic network, FiOS. But it decided to stop expanding and focus on improving the profitability of the existing FiOS ecosystem. Why invest on fast Internet when you can mint money on mobile service, and when fast Internet makes services such as Skype more of threat? What is good for the phone, cable and Internet companies is not good for America. To open the country to the future, Internet providers would need to build a network of fibers reaching into all our homes. Fiber optic cables will make the Internet so fast we can barely imagine it. To show us what we're missing, and probably to prod us into action, Google decided to build those networks in a handful of cities. Google Fiber, growing in Kansas City, Austin and Provo, Utah, will clock at an astounding 1,000 Mbps. That's an incredible 200 times faster than the Lafayette example, and 100 times faster than the U.S. average. In the past few years, I have experienced Internet service that is cheaper and much faster in Paris, Tokyo, London, Amsterdam, Jerusalem and other cities. America's Internet is awful and awfully expensive. That means Americans waste precious time waiting for downloads to limp onto their screens. It also means American businesses are less efficient than they could be, and it means America's brilliant, creative technological minds and its entrepreneurs, who already gave the world the Internet and much of its wonders, are falling behind and will continue to fall even further. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report, the U.S. ranks 35th in world Internet bandwidth per user despite being ranked No. 1 in gross domestic product. Countless reports have documented the embarrassing state of the country's crawling Internet network. Adding insult to this electronic injury are the larcenous rates extracted by providers from America's mostly helpless consumers. Check out Akamai's quarterly State of the Internet report, and you will discover that as bad as the situation is, it is only getting worse, particularly when it comes to top quality connection speeds. The world's fastest average peak connection speeds, which requires bringing the Internet over fiber lines, are found in Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Israel, with peak speeds in the range of 47.7 Mbps to 65 Mbps. The U.S. did not even make it into the top ten for the category. Meanwhile, the U.S. average connection speed was just 9.8 Mbps, less than half that of South Korea. There are a number of possible solutions. In places where the Web signal flies like an Olympic luge over the ice, the government may have developed the infrastructure, but they can rent those fiber lines to private telecom firms that package the service for consumers. The fees can even bring profit to municipal coffers. Some American cities are experimenting with the idea. But the telecom firms are generous and powerful lobbyists, poised to block competition and regulations. At this time of national political polarization, this is a ripe issue for new politicians hoping to bring change. My humble proposal is that brave new candidates tackle the problem loudly, embracing the common purpose of helping consumers while responding to an urgent national imperative. It is a problem that unites Americans across party lines, and those fed up with party lines, in their disdain for the companies that give them an inferior service at a ridiculous price. Politicians who campaign -- and later govern -- with a clear plan to improve America's Internet infrastructure will incur the wrath of wealthy corporations, but they will earn the admiration of voters.","Comcast proposed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion .

"Every time I hear about another case of a woman breastfeeding her baby in a restaurant, department store or on a plane who is asked to cover up, head to the bathroom or leave altogether, I wonder why in 2014 we remain so incredibly uncomfortable with breastfeeding in public. In one of the most recent examples that garnered national attention, a mom in Beverly Hills says she was escorted to the bathroom at an Anthropologie store when she was breastfeeding her six-week-old baby. Outraged, she took to social media and less than a day later more than 100 women staged a ""nurse-in"" at the store to protest. Beaverton, Oregon, was the site of another recent ""nurse-in"" after a breastfeeding mom was asked to cover up in a restaurant. In both cases, reaction was decidedly mixed. There were plenty who were as furious as the breastfeeding mothers and pointed to California and Oregon laws, which allow women to breastfeed in any public or private location with the exception of someone else's private home. But there were also plenty of voices in the anti-breastfeeding-in-public camp. ""It's not about what's 'legal,'"" wrote one reader on the Oregon Live website. ""It's more about what's 'right.' And the effects our choices have on the people around us. A simple burp rag over the child and the problem goes away."" Why at a time when celebrities bare nearly all and are celebrated for it (for example, consider Kim Kardashian leaving little to the imagination at the recent MTV Video Music Awards) do we as a society still seem so put off by a woman using her breasts for what they were made for? ""Many times you will see more 'cleavage' in the name of fashion than you ever would from a mom feeding her child,"" said Raivon Lee, a breastfeeding mom of a 19-month-old. Let me just say right here that this is not a piece on the benefits of breastfeeding or a push to make the case that ""breast is best"" and encourage women to breastfeed. This is strictly about why the sight of public breastfeeding still makes so many people squeamish and what it will take to make breastfeeding in public as welcome as giving a baby a bottle. Lee, who lives in Atlanta and hosts a blog called Vain Mommy, believes people's ""uneasiness"" with breastfeeding in public stems from the perception of women as sexual objects. ""Women buy into that idea,"" she said. ""If we use our breasts for anything other than 'play' it's not okay."" Earlier this month, in connection with Breastfeeding Awareness Month, Lee joined 50 other nursing moms, members of a group called the ""Badass Breastfeeders of Atlanta,"" for a ""Big Latch On"" event where they nursed together in public and were joined by their families and other bystanders. Part of the goal, says Lee, was to help communities support breastfeeding in public places. ""The message is simply: Nursing is normal anytime, anywhere . . . any way."" Lee says she's never been asked to leave a restaurant or store while she was breastfeeding but says it's probably because she's a ""shy"" nurser, who has been self-conscious because of people's discomfort with breastfeeding in public. ""Sadly, it has affected me, and I'm sure other moms have been (affected) too."" Years of experience have certainly made some mothers, like Stephanie Dulli of Washington much more comfortable breastfeeding in public. On Facebook, Dulli shared how with her first baby, she nursed privately in the back room of her home when company was over. With her second, she nursed publicly but covered up. With her third baby, who is 2 months old, she says she ""answered the door for the UPS guy while nursing, uncovered and didn't even notice."" ""Nursing is just something I do now,"" said Dulli, who blogs about parenting at Stephanie Says. ""I'm not embarrassed or ashamed. When I'm in public I do try to be thoughtful to others but I nurse whenever (the) baby is hungry."" Dulli says she has never been asked by anyone to leave a public place while breastfeeding. ""I'd love to see them try!"" she told me. ""I've nursed everywhere from the South Lawn of the White House to the National Cathedral to airplanes and Little League dug outs and no one has said anything!"" When I asked Dulli what she thinks it will take for us to be as comfortable with a woman breastfeeding in public as we are with a mom giving her baby a bottle in public, she said ""time."" ""I think by the time my daughter is nursing ... it won't be a big deal,"" she said. Lee, the Atlanta mom of one, says the way to make public breastfeeding more acceptable is to make ""working breasts more visible."" ""We as moms, myself included, need to be bold and comfortable with nursing in public,"" says Lee. ""We aren't doing anything wrong. If our child is hungry, we should pull our breast out just as we would a bottle. The breast was the first bottle."" Lee said more education is also needed. ""As silly as it sounds, we need to educate the community on the fact that breastfeeding is indeed normal, natural and okay"". Judgment of any mother's feeding choice needs to stop, say moms. Because some people's discomfort with public breastfeeding may stem from their own insecurities about breastfeeding or a feeling that the ""breast is best"" crowd is passing judgment on those who choose not to breastfeed or those who can't. Michelle Noehren, founder of CTWorkingMoms.com, is not uncomfortable when she sees women breastfeeding in public but believes we need to do more to support all women's choices. Noehren said she had every intention of breastfeeding but after her daughter's birth, which was traumatic, she needed to stop breastfeeding to take medication to cope with the trauma. ""Through my personal experience I learned to be less judgmental of other parents' feeding choices because I realized that sometimes not breastfeeding isn't even a choice; it's simply not possible,"" said Noehren, who has a 3-year-old daughter.  ""I also think that women who choose formula from the start, for whatever reason, should not be made to feel guilty."" It's a matter of respect. ""Women deserve the right to be in control of what we do with our bodies,"" Noehren said. Do you think people are still squeamish about breastfeeding?

"London (CNN)Can anybody stop Real Madrid, on the football pitch and off it? For the 10th year running, European champion Real Madrid is the world's richest club in the annual Football Money League published by accountants Deloitte, with a revenue of $639 million. Money clearly talks in European football with the combined revenues of the top 20 clubs in the rich list rising by a staggering 14% over the last year to $7 billion. All of the top five clubs for the 2013-14 financial year saw their revenue surpass the $500-million mark for the first time on a list dominated by the English Premier League, home to five of this year's top 10 and eight of the 20-strong list. As a result of the latest Premier League broadcast rights deal, all of its teams have made it into the world's top 40 highest-earning clubs. This year is the 18th running of Deloitte's Money League, which has been dominated by Real for a decade, although Manchester United catapulted past both Barcelona ($563.5 million) and Bayern Munich ($566.8 million) to move into second place with revenues of $602.3 million, a hike in revenue of some $110 million. United has been below par on the pitch in recent times, under former manager David Moyes and his successor Louis van Gaal, but figures show an 83% growth in commercial revenue over the last three years. That said, United is expected to slide in next year's Money League having missed out on Champions League revenues in this current season. Of the clubs on the list only United's ""noisy neighbors"" Manchester City -- as Alex Ferguson once described them -- enjoyed a greater spike in year-on-year revenue, with a $114 million rise from 2012-13 to cement their place in sixth on the list. ""The growth experienced within the top 20 has been remarkable,"" said Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. ""Commercial and broadcast revenues are now more important than ever to clubs to enable them to compete financially and put the best talent on the pitch. ""This has led to further dominance from the 'big five' European leagues  -- England, Germany, Spain, Italy and France -- this year, with just Turkey's Galatasaray making it in from outside of those countries. ""Winning the Champions League for an unprecedented 10th time and staying at the top of the Money League made 2013-14 the year of the 'Doble Décima' for Real Madrid. ""The club's continued success on the field is complemented by its financial strength and their accomplishment emphasizes their position as the most successful European club side of all time. However, their commercial supremacy is being challenged by Manchester United among others."" Barcelona's revenue plateaued last year, seeing them drop from second spot behind arch-rival Real to fourth below Manchester United and Bayern.

"(CNN) -- It's become a nightly ritual. When dusk descends, so do they -- by the hundreds, in cities coast to coast. And the protests over police brutality after recent deaths of unarmed black men might only intensify. Organizers are calling this week a ""Week of Outrage,"" culminating in large demonstrations planned for Saturday in New York and Washington. Eric Garner Jr., the son of the man who died after a New York police officer held him in a chokehold, said he was proud of how protesters are carrying on. ""It made me feel proud because I don't have to share this moment by myself and my family,"" the son told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""It's amazing how everybody (is) doing this. My father and I appreciate it."" But already this week, peaceful protests across the country have been marred by bouts of violence and crowds that disrupted thousands by shutting down freeways. Here's the latest on the unrest across the country: . Protesters 'die in' At New York City's Grand Central Station, protesters Tuesday night re-enacted the chokehold that killed Eric Garner, laid on the ground and chanted. Demonstrator Dariel Ali, who's participated in New York protests for days, held a sign that said, ""My only crime is being black."" ""There's a lot of racial profiling going on within the system,"" he said as protesters chanted behind him. It's been encouraging to see the ranks of protesters grow in recent days, he said. What's next? ""We gain numbers,"" Ali said, ""and we take the streets, like we always do."" NBA players speak out . Before the Brooklyn Nets and Cleveland Cavaliers faced off on the basketball court Monday night, several players were already scoring points with protesters outside the arena. As they warmed up for the game, Cleveland Cavaliers LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were among the players wearing T-shirts that said ""I can't breathe"" -- Eric Garner's last words, which have become a rallying cry for protesters after last week's grand jury decision not to indict an officer in his death. The crowd erupted in cheers after an organizer told them about the players' T-shirts. After the game, James explained why he wore the ""I can't breathe"" shirt. ""It was a message to the family. I'm sorry for their loss,"" the four-time league MVP said. ""Obviously, we know that our society needs to get better. But like I said before ... violence is not the answer, and retaliation isn't the solution. As a society, we know we need to get better, but it's not going to be done in one day. Rome wasn't built in a day."" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told CNN Tuesday that he supports players who want to voice their opinions. ""I have a tremendous respect for our players and the fact that they want to speak out on an issue, and we support them doing that,"" he said. ""Of course, there are the four corners of the court, and in terms of the game itself it is my job to enforce our rules. Having said that, I recognize that there needs to be some flexibility and I think, to me, that was a spontaneous reaction from our players ... and my sense is that, to respect it."" California interstate shut down . For the second night in a row, protesters spilled onto a Northern California freeway Monday night, this time shutting down Interstate 80 in Berkeley. Many snaked through the hundreds of cars that were trapped for an hour and a half. ""We are out here because the system has made it obvious that black lives do not matter, and us as a people are not OK with that,"" a protester in Berkeley told CNN. ""We're here to demand justice, and we're here to demand peace."" The California Highway Patrol arrested 150 people for illegally blocking the freeway, the agency said. Some protesters also sat on a train track in Berkeley, blocking a train from moving, the San Francisco Bay Guardian reported. But unlike Sunday night, when some protesters looted businesses and damaged several police cars in the Oakland and Berkeley areas, there were no reports of major destruction in Northern California. Obama weighs in . After weeks of racial protests across the country, President Barack Obama spoke about the future of race relations in America to a network that reaches a predominantly young African-American audience. ""What I told the young people who I met with -- we're going to have more conversations over the coming months -- is, 'This isn't something that is going to be solved overnight,' Obama said in an interview with BET. "" 'This is something that is deeply rooted in our society. It's deeply rooted in our history.' "" Once criticized for shying away from the topic of race early on in his presidency, Obama has more recently been forced to lead a discussion on the issue. In his interview, the President said African-American youths need to be both persistent and patient in order to make progress on the issue of racial tensions in America. ""It's important to recognize as painful as these incidents are, we can't equate what is happening now to what happened 50 years ago,"" he said. ""If you talk to your parents, grandparents, uncles, they'll tell you that things are better -- not good, in some cases, but better."" CNN's Dan Simon in Berkeley, California; Nick Valencia, Julian Cummings and Lawrence Crook in New York; Sara Fischer in Washington; and Emily Smith and Tina Burnside in Atlanta contributed to this report.","NEW: ""My only crime is being black,"" one sign says at a New York protest .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Two of Moammar Gadhafi's sons, who had been reported captured over the weekend, were free early Tuesday as forces loyal to the embattled Libyan leader battled rebels trying to consolidate their hold on Tripoli. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi showed up at the Rixos Hotel, one of the remaining strongholds of pro-Gadhafi forces, in a convoy of armored Land Cruisers. In a brief interview with CNN's Matthew Chance, he said his father and several of his sisters were safe in Tripoli, and that loyal troops had ""broken the back"" of the rebels who moved into the capital over the weekend. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, who is wanted on war crimes charges by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, had been reported captured on Sunday along with two of his brothers. Another of those siblings, Mohammed Gadhafi, was reported to have escaped Monday, according to the Libyan ambassador to the United States. There was no immediate explanation from the National Transitional Council, the rebel leadership that had announced their capture Sunday. The younger Gadhafi said news of his arrest had been a trick by the rebels, and that he had been traveling around Tripoli in his armored convoy the entire time. He said that government forces had lured the rebels into a trap in the capital, and that Gadhafi loyalists ""have broken the spines of those rats and those gangsters."" Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the ICC's chief prosecutor, had said Sunday that he would seek Saif al-Islam Gadhafi's extradition following his capture. Asked about the warrant for his arrest, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi told reporters, ""To hell with the ICC."" The rebels had most of Tripoli under their control late Monday, but pitched battles continued at various points around the city and Moammar Gadhafi's whereabouts remained unknown. Gun battles in the area around the longtime Libyan strongman's former Bab al-Aziziya compound echoed until after nightfall Monday. ""The real moment of victory is when Gadhafi is captured,"" NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil told reporters in Benghazi. Gadhafi has held power in Libya since a September 1969 coup. The rebellion against him began in February and has been aided by NATO airstrikes that began in March, under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians. The revolt gained momentum rapidly in the past two weeks, with rebel forces launching their push on Tripoli over the weekend. In a statement to reporters from his vacation on the Massachusetts resort island of Martha's Vineyard, U.S. President Barack Obama said that while situation remained fluid, it was clear that ""Gadhafi's rule is over."" ""The pursuit of human dignity is stronger than any dictator,"" he said. On Sunday, Gadhafi took to the airwaves several times urging citizens, including women, to fight the rebels -- whom he called ""very small groups of people who are collaborators with the imperialists."" ""Get out and lead, lead, lead the people to paradise,"" he said. Under Gadhafi, Libyans lived ""as slaves,"" a 23-year-old Tripoli woman, who agreed to be identified only as Noura, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Though Gadhafi is the only Libyan leader she has ever known, his ouster ""will be the best thing that ever happened to me,"" Noura said. ""I will thank Allah for every moment I will live without him, without his control and without his sons' control as well,"" she said. If the Gadhafi regime falls, it would follow revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt this year in what is known as the Arab Spring. A spate of other countries in the region -- including Bahrain, Yemen and Syria -- have also seen protests by citizens demanding more freedom and a change in regime. In many cases, these demonstrations have been met with brute force. But pro-Gadhafi forces were still fighting into the early hours of Tuesday. Tracer fire, anti-aircraft guns and artillery could be seen and heard around Zawiya, about 30 miles west of the capital, which was a strategic steppingstone for the rebel advance into Tripoli over the weekend. NATO warplanes flew overhead at times, and ambulances raced through the town after the fighting erupted. Gadhafi's forces also fired at least three missiles at the rebel-held city of Misrata, east of Tripoli, on Monday evening, the NATO alliance reported. NATO said it had no reports of damage or injuries, but called the launches a ""direct threat to innocent people."" ""Although the surface-to-surface missiles in Gadhafi's arsenal are highly inaccurate, and are not designed to hit a specific target, they are a weapon of terror,"" NATO said. ""Their use against an urban or industrial area is utterly irresponsible."" At least one missile was a Soviet-era Scud, launched from near Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte, said a U.S. military official who spoke on condition of anonymity Monday evening. NATO forces destroyed another of the missiles on the ground over the weekend, and another of the short- to medium-range missiles was fired at rebel forces last week but exploded harmlessly in the desert, a senior NATO official said. U.S. and NATO officials said they were concerned forces loyal to Gadhafi might stage a last-ditch attack against civilians. Senior levels of NATO were watching closely for any sign of a massing of Libyan government forces or the movement of weapons such as rockets or artillery, said a senior allied official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of sensitive intelligence matters. Former U.S. diplomat Nicholas Burns told CNN that it was ""imperative"" that Gadhafi be found quickly and the fighting brought to an end. ""The danger here is that this insurgency could continue, the fighting could continue, as long as Gadhafi believes he's still in power,"" Burns said. The rebels on Monday also arrested Hala Misrati, an anchor from Libya's state-run television. Misrati had brandished a gun on air over the weekend and said that staffers at the television station were prepared to become martyrs. ""With this weapon, I either kill or die today,"" she said Sunday. Rebels said they found her in her car near a coffee shop Monday, and pandemonium ensued when word got out that Misrati had been arrested. Witnesses said Misrati was unharmed but would not be speaking to reporters. A cordon of soldiers quickly formed to isolate her from media representatives, other rebels and gawkers. CNN's Sara Sidner, Jomana Karadsheh, Kareem Khadder, Raja Razek, Christine Theodorou, Kamal Ghattas, Roba Alhenawi, Holly Yan, Chelsea J. Carter, Josh Levs and Barbara Starr and journalist Mike Mount contributed to this report.","NEW: Saif al-Islam Gadhafi appears at Tripoli hotel after report of capture .

"As we leave our bus, we can barely hear a sound. We have stopped near a public square in the center of Pyongyang. Our government minders whisked us here with just a moment's notice. In a country obsessed with secrecy, we are told where we will be taken only at the last minute. Our schedule can change even while we are mid-trip. We'd started our day at the birthplace of the man North Koreans call the ""Great Leader"" and the father of the country, Kim Il Sung. This is the centenary of his birth, and North Koreans are flocking here to pay homage. To these people, Kim is more than a leader; he is akin to a god. According to the constitution, he will be president for eternity. I ask our government minder if we can speak to some people. In North Korea, it is forbidden for us to simply approach someone unannounced. He selects a group for us and then asks me to choose. They are young women, probably only in their 20s, and all from the same Pyongyang factory. They are nervous, wary of our intentions. ""President Kim Il Sung is our father,"" one lady says. ""We are one family, and because of his birth, he has given us a powerful socialist state."" Others here are mourning the death of the Great Leader's son, the man they call the ""Dear Leader,"" Kim Jong Il. His sudden death in December sparked public displays of grief. For one woman we met this day, the tears have not stopped. ""We used to come here with happiness, but not anymore,"" she says. ""My heart is breaking. This is why I can't stop crying."" This is the power of the Kim cult. These men are dead, but in every other respect, they are still alive. Here in an atheist communist country, it is no exaggeration to say they are god-like. The drab concrete skyline is brightened only by the splashes of color of the countless thousands of portraits, paintings and statues of the leaders. ""Quickly, on the bus,"" our minder orders. We are being rushed from our birthplace pilgrimage to what we are being told is a great surprise. And this is where we leave our bus. We are ushered up a hill, and there before us is a sea of people. Everyone stands in rows, silent, not even moving. Then a thunderous roar; before them are two massive mosaics, the smiling faces of the Great Leader and his son. The people arise as one, holding flowers and chanting. This is the adulation the regime demands. Human rights groups and defectors claim that people can be sent to brutal gulags for not showing enough deference or the crime of having dust on one of the leader's portraits. In this way, the personality cult continues. And now the power is passed to a new generation: The youthful Kim Jong Un is now the ""Supreme Leader.""

"(CNN) -- Seeing the first set of images from the typhoon zone in the Philippines is like experiencing a dreadful sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu: Flooded roads, fallen huts, small buildings with the rooftops ripped off, and dead animals littering the streets. If this devastation appears eerily familiar, it is because we also saw the same horrific spectacle last year when Typhoon Haiyan struck. Sadly, both the Philippines and the rest of the world are proving slow in learning the most important lessons of these disasters. Hagupit, which means ""smash"" or ""lash"" in Filipino, is a fitting name for the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year (it is actually known as Ruby by locals). When it was first spotted by satellites several days ago, it was immediately likened to Haiyan, the super typhoon that killed more than 6,000 people last year. And while Hagupit didn't create a more-than-20-foot storm surge like Haiyan did, it has still left a trail of destruction in a region that was still recovering from the latest of what seems like an unending series of calamities. This time around, the country was a little better prepared. Haiyan was a huge embarrassment to the Philippine government, with many survivors complaining about the slow delivery of relief and medical assistance in the aftermath of the disaster. Indeed, one of the positive things to come emerge of the Haiyan catastrophe is that disaster preparation has become much more of a focus for the bureaucracy. This was evident over the past week as agencies and local authorities worked diligently to prepare for Hagupit's onslaught -- more than 650,000 Filipinos were already sheltered in evacuation centers as the storm hit, and relief goods were in place for quick distribution. Meanwhile, government offices were used as disaster monitoring centers as politicians worked with disaster experts, news stations acted as weather channels, churches and other civic institutions readied relief operations, businesses offered discounts, and even communist rebels vowed to assist the victims. All this meant that the Philippines was already on a disaster footing when the storm arrived, as disaster preparation became the catchphrase not just of good governance, but also citizen responsibility. For better or worse, this preparation and post-impact operations also became more militarized as civilian officials took a leaf out of the military handbook in implementing their plans. But while this certainly made agencies more efficient in coordinating their efforts, some residents have complained about the intense militarization in their communities created by what they see as the unnecessary troop deployments. Unfortunately, while the additional manpower might have been welcome in some areas, in others, certain state agencies used the deployments to impose stricter control of communities. For example, some residents said they felt insulted about the reported military presence at the large shopping malls in Tacloban, apparently to prevent a repeat of the supposed looting that took place in the city last year, when desperate Haiyan survivors clamored for emergency supplies at supermarkets. The protection for big business contrasted with orders issued by local officials to clear the stalls of small vendors. But while a state understandably must be decisive when disaster is imminent, the focus on the immediate danger should not be allowed to distract from some of the underlying issues. For example, in the lead-up to Hagupit hitting, there was little mention of the fact that it took the President 11 months to approve the comprehensive rehabilitation plan for Haiyan-hit provinces, or that Filipino governments for years have allowed large-scale logging operations. Officials respond that it is a distraction to quibble over these issues when lives are at stake. Now is not the time, they argue. In fact, quite the opposite is true -- now is exactly the time to discuss these issues, while Philippine and international attention is focused on them. After all, the point of noting these issues is not to criticize the government for the sake of doing so, but to try to encourage debate on how to address the roots of the extreme weather disturbances that are wreaking havoc in developing countries like the Philippines. But this debate on the impact of storms like Haiyan and Hagupit should be taking place not just in the Philippines, but overseas. While Filipinos have been preparing for some of the worst effects of our changing climate, global climate talks have been continuing in Peru. And yet even though a year has passed since yet another disaster has claimed thousands of lives, global leaders appear to be making little concrete progress towards a deal that will require them to make greater commitment -- and invest more resources -- toward tackling climate change. As Hagupit crawled toward the Philippines, the World Meteorological Organization announced that 2014 is ""on track to be one of the hottest, if not the hottest"" years on record. ""The provisional information for 2014 means that 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all occurred in the 21st century,"" WMO Secretary General Michel Jarraud said last week. ""There is no standstill in global warming."" Such realities should be all the reason the international community needs to push forward towards a substantive climate pact. Too many governments -- in the Philippines and beyond -- act as if disaster preparation only involves a few days of monitoring typhoons and deploying troops to disaster zones. It is this sort of narrow thinking that will leave more and more nations, developing and developed alike, to face the lashing of the next Hagupit.","Typhoon Hagupit is the strongest storm to hit Philippines this year .

"Steve Jobs, the visionary in the black turtleneck who co-founded Apple in a Silicon Valley garage, built it into the world's leading tech company and led a mobile-computing revolution with wildly popular devices such as the iPhone, died Wednesday. He was 56. The hard-driving executive pioneered the concept of the personal computer and of navigating them by clicking onscreen images with a mouse. In more recent years, he introduced the iPod portable music player, the iPhone and the iPad tablet -- all of which changed how we consume content in the digital age. Fortune: Ten ways Steve Jobs changed the world . His friends and Apple fans on Wednesday night mourned the passing of a tech titan. ""Steve's brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives,"" Apple said in a statement. ""The world is immeasurably better because of Steve."" See reactions from Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and many others . More than one pundit, praising Jobs' ability to transform entire industries with his inventions, called him a modern-day Leonardo Da Vinci. ""Steve Jobs is one of the great innovators in the history of modern capitalism,"" New York Times columnist Joe Nocera said in August. ""His intuition has been phenomenal over the years."" Jobs' death, while dreaded by Apple's legions of fans, was not unexpected. He had battled cancer for years, took a medical leave from Apple in January and stepped down as chief executive in August because he could ""no longer meet (his) duties and expectations."" Born February 24, 1955, and then adopted, Jobs grew up in Cupertino, California -- which would become home to Apple's headquarters -- and showed an early interest in electronics. As a teenager, he phoned William Hewlett, president of Hewlett-Packard, to request parts for a school project. He got them, along with an offer of a summer job at HP. Jobs dropped out of Oregon's Reed College after one semester, although he returned to audit a class in calligraphy, which he says influenced Apple's graceful, minimalist aesthetic. He quit one of his first jobs, designing video games for Atari, to backpack across India and take psychedelic drugs. Those experiences, Jobs said later, shaped his creative vision. ""You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future,"" he told Stanford University graduates during a commencement speech in 2005. ""You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."" View a time line of Steve Jobs' work . While at HP, Jobs befriended Steve Wozniak, who impressed him with his skill at assembling electronic components. The two later joined a Silicon Valley computer hobbyists club, and when he was 21, Jobs teamed with Wozniak and two other men to launch Apple Computer Inc. It's long been Silicon Valley legend: Jobs and Wozniak built their first commercial product, the Apple 1, in Jobs' parents' garage in 1976. Jobs sold his Volkswagen van to help finance the venture. The primitive computer, priced at $666.66, had no keyboard or display, and customers had to assemble it themselves. The following year, Apple unveiled the Apple II computer at the inaugural West Coast Computer Faire. The machine was a hit, and the personal computing revolution was under way. Jobs was among the first computer engineers to recognize the appeal of the mouse and the graphical interface, which let users operate computers by clicking on images instead of writing text. Apple's pioneering Macintosh computer launched in early 1984 with a now-iconic, Orwellian-themed Super Bowl ad. The boxy beige Macintosh sold well, but the demanding Jobs clashed frequently with colleagues, and in 1986, he was ousted from Apple after a power struggle. Then came a 10-year hiatus during which he founded NeXT Computer, whose pricey, cube-shaped computer workstations never caught on with consumers. Jobs had more success when he bought Pixar Animation Studios from George Lucas before the company made it big with ""Toy Story."" Jobs brought the same marketing skill to Pixar that he became known for at Apple. His brief but emotional pitch for ""Finding Nemo,"" for example, was a masterful bit of succinct storytelling. Share your memories and images of Steve Jobs . In 1996, Apple bought NeXT, returning Jobs to the then-struggling company he had co-founded. Within a year, he was running Apple again -- older and perhaps wiser but no less of a perfectionist. And in 2001, he took the stage to introduce the original iPod, the little white device that transformed portable music and kick-started Apple's furious comeback. Thus began one of the most remarkable second acts in the history of business. Over the next decade, Jobs wowed launch-event audiences, and consumers, with one game-changing hit after another: iTunes (2003), the iPhone (2007), the App Store (2008), and the iPad (2010). Review Jobs' top moments as a showman . Observers marveled at Jobs' skills as a pitchman, his ability to inspire godlike devotion among Apple ""fanboys"" (and scorn from PC fans) and his ""one more thing"" surprise announcements. Time after time, he sold people on a product they didn't know they needed until he invented it. And all this on an official annual salary of $1. He also built a reputation as a hard-driving, mercurial and sometimes difficult boss who oversaw almost every detail of Apple's products and rejected prototypes that didn't meet his exacting standards. By the late 2000s, his once-renegade tech company, the David to Microsoft's Goliath, was entrenched at the uppermost tier of American business. Apple now operates more than 300 retail stores in 11 countries. The company has sold more than 275 million iPods, 100 million iPhones and 25 million iPads worldwide. Jobs' climb to the top was complete in summer 2011, when Apple listed more cash reserves than the U.S. Treasury and even briefly surpassed Exxon Mobil as the world's most valuable company. CNNMoney.com: Apple stock under Jobs . But Jobs' health problems sometimes cast a shadow over his company's success. In 2004, he announced to his employees that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. He lost weight and appeared unusually gaunt at keynote speeches to Apple developers, spurring concerns about his health and fluctuations in the company's stock price. One wire service accidentally published Jobs' obituary. Jobs had a secret liver transplant in 2009 in Tennessee during a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple. He took another medical leave in January this year. Perhaps mindful of his legacy, he cooperated on his first authorized biography, scheduled to be published by Simon & Schuster in November. Jobs is survived by his wife of 20 years, Laurene, and four children, including one from a prior relationship. He always spoke with immense pride about what he and his engineers accomplished at Apple. ""Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do,"" he told the Stanford grads in 2005. ""If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.""","Jobs had battled cancer for years .

"Surely, not. Sometimes things happen that propel a palm to your head. You just ask aloud, ""Really?"" With the brightest of spotlights on the NFL -- and its handling of domestic violence issues threatening to tarnish the shield that represents the most profitable and popular sports league in the country -- you'd think the nation's pro football players would be on their best behavior. So, it sparks a little incredulity when -- on the heels of five players' arrests, the indefinite suspension of a premier running back and the deactivation of two of the NFL's biggest stars -- yet another NFL player is alleged to have exacted violence against loved ones. As women's groups demand change from the top down -- and one group is demanding the ouster of Commissioner Roger Goodell and flying banners over stadiums that say, ""#GoodellMustGo"" -- the bad news kept piling on the National Football League on Wednesday. Jonathan Dwyer walked off the Arizona Cardinals' practice field and into the backseat of a Phoenix police cruiser after multiple allegations of felony assault. It was the latest public relations debacle for the NFL, as Dwyer brought the total number of players facing domestic violence or child abuse charges to six, after July incidents in which police say he broke his wife's nose with a head butt and punched her in the face. Here is a quick look at those players and their travails. Adrian Peterson . One of the top players in the NFL, he left the Minnesota Vikings on Wednesday to deal with child abuse accusations in Texas. Peterson had been deactivated by the Vikings and missed Sunday's game, then reactivated Monday. But the team said it needed to correct its mistake and deactivated him again. Peterson then took a leave of absence and Goodell placed him on the exempt list, which gives the team the opportunity to continue to pay him while he deals with his legal issues. At no point has Peterson been suspended. Greg Hardy . The Carolina Panthers' defensive star also took a leave of absence because of legal troubles. As with Peterson, Hardy will be paid while he is away from the team. Hardy was convicted by a judge in July on misdemeanor assault charges. He asked for a new trial in front of a jury, which is scheduled for mid-November. Hardy played one game then was deactivated as the outrage against the NFL grew over how it was dealing with domestic violence issues. He has proclaimed his innocence of the charges, which were filed after police said he assaulted his then-girlfriend and threatened to kill her. He was sentenced to 18 months of probation and received a 60-day suspended sentence. Jonathan Dwyer . The most recent player to be arrested, the running back is alleged to have assaulted a 27-year-old woman and an 18-month-old child. Sgt. Trent Crump, a Phoenix police spokesman, said it would be reckless to identify the victims. Dwyer, 25, spent Wednesday night in the Maricopa County Jail, and the Arizona Cardinals deactivated him. Crump said neighbors reported two incidents in July. Dwyer posted bond and was released from jail Thursday after a judge set a $25,000 ""cash-only"" bond and required him to wear an electronic monitoring device and abide by a curfew. He won't be able to take part in any team activities after his release. The woman didn't allege any violence until last week, when she called from another state, where she had moved with the child. The most serious of six charges were three counts of assault, one of which caused a fracture. CNN's attempt to reach his agent was unsuccessful. Ray Rice . The running back without a team is appealing his indefinite suspension by the league. While Rice has called punching his future wife in the head and knocking her out ""inexcusable,"" he is seeking to have the opportunity to play in the NFL again. The players' union has complained that Rice didn't receive due process from Goodell, who suspended him in June to a two-game ban, then increased the penalty to an indefinite suspension. That came earlier this month after TMZ Sports posted a video that showed the punch. Rice was three days away from completing the original suspension when the indefinite ban was handed down and when the Baltimore Ravens terminated his contract. Ray McDonald . On August 31, three days after Goodell created an NFL policy against domestic violence, San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle Ray McDonald was arrested on an accusation of felony domestic violence. The new policy imposes a minimum six-game unpaid ban for first-time offenders and up to a lifetime ban for second-time offenders. No charges have been filed in the incident involving McDonald. Neither the team nor the league has levied any discipline in the case, and the starter at left defensive tackle played the first two games of the season. Quincy Enunwa . The Jets practice squad player's arrest went practically overlooked outside of the New York area. According to USA Today's ""NFL Players Arrests"" tracker, he was arrested on September 4. Enunwa was charged with simple assault after a woman told police he pulled her off a bed at a hotel, causing a head injury, ESPNNewYork.com reported. He pleaded not guilty, ESPN said, adding that the player was still practicing with the team.

"(CNN) -- The five Taliban figures who got out of Guantanamo in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release would be taking an ""enormous risk"" if they return to the battlefield, Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN in an interview that aired Sunday. ""I'm not telling you that they don't have some ability at some point to go back and get involved (in fighting). But they also have an ability to get killed doing that. "" Kerry said in his first public comments on the controversial prisoner exchange. Kerry defended the swap and told CNN the former detainees will be monitored closely -- and not just by officials in Qatar, where they were flown after being released. He wouldn't say who else will be watching, but he said the United States is confident the conditions of their release will be honored. ""And if they're violated, then we have the ability to be able to do things,"" he said, warning that the United States would do whatever is necessary to protect Americans ""if these guys pick a fight with us in the future, or now, or at any time."" Bergdahl was released May 31 near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in an exchange for five Taliban detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Republican critics in Washington have complained that the exchange for Bergdahl gave up hardened terrorists capable of attacking U.S. troops and interests. In addition, legislators from both parties accuse the Obama administration of violating the National Defense Authorization Act by failing to provide 30 days' advance notice to Congress of a transfer of Guantanamo detainees. Administration officials have given several reasons for the lack of notification -- a need to move quickly due to Bergdahl's poor health and the overall threat to his safety, and the likelihood that even a small leak of the plan could have led to his death. How did six soldiers die after Bergdahl's disappearance? U.S. official: Bergdahl wants to be called private first class . New reports about Bergdahl's time in captivity . Bergdahl is recovering at a U.S. military hospital in Germany as details slowly emerge about his condition after five years of captivity. Citing an American official, The New York Times reported Sunday that Bergdahl told medical staff that the box he was kept in for weeks at a time was pitch black and like a shark cage. CNN reported Friday that Bergdahl has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape, according to a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified. The official also told CNN that Bergdahl suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse. A Taliban source with knowledge of Bergdahl's captivity told CNN's Nic Robertson Sunday that Bergdahl was kept in a house owned by an old man, then escaped and was on the run for three days. When he was recaptured after that escape attempt, according to the Taliban source, he was not punished with a cage or cell, but was taken to a more secure location where he had no chance to escape. A U.S. official told CNN last week that Bergdahl may have tried to escape his Taliban captors on at least two occasions. The Taliban source said Bergdahl was given books to read that included Islamic books, but he was not forced to convert and remained true to his Christian upbringing. He was allowed to celebrate Christmas and Easter, the source said. Bergdahl learned to speak the local language of Pashto, was able to exercise and sometimes played soccer with the Taliban, the source said. Hospital: Bergdahl is improving, but isn't ready to travel . Doctors at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, where Bergdahl was taken after his handover, said Friday that he was in stable condition and continued to improve but wasn't ready to travel to the United States. ""There is no predetermined timeline for Sgt. Bergdahl's recovery process,"" a hospital statement said. ""The duration will continue to be based on the pace of his healing and reintegration process."" The Times report added that Bergdahl has taken walks outside his hospital room while wearing his Army uniform, according to the American official. Bergdahl, who was promoted twice on schedule while in captivity, objects to being called sergeant, the Times reported. Bergdahl was a private first class when he went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. When he is ready, Bergdahl will be flown to the San Antonio Military Medical Center in Texas, where he may be able to reunite with his parents. Bergdahl has not spoken with them since his release. Taliban celebrates . Nine songs celebrating the release of the five Taliban detainees were posted to a Taliban website Saturday. On one tune, a singer calls the men ""grand champions"" and praises their Islamic faith. According to a CNN translation, a man sings in Pashto: . Welcome a hundred times, welcome grand champions . Congratulations your new life, O freed men . Welcome a hundred times, welcome grand champions . Congratulations your new life, O freed men . Threats against parents . The FBI is investigating threats against Bergdahl's parents, who have not been seen publicly since sending their son messages of love through a news conference days after his release. ""We are working jointly with our state and local partners and taking each threat seriously,"" FBI Special Agent William Facer told CNN in an e-mail Saturday. Facer declined to detail the nature and severity of the threats, and a military representative for the Bergdahls declined to comment. Bergdahl's father received threats in three messages via e-mail at his home, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the contents of the e-mail. The first threat came on Wednesday, the official said, adding that FBI investigators will be tracing the messages to pinpoint who sent them. Since Bergdahl's release, critics, including a former member of his unit, have contended that Bergdahl deserted. The Army concluded in a 2009 report that he left his post deliberately. But the Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials can't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN.

"Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe on Tuesday fired his deputy Joice Mujuru, a few hours after she dismissed allegations that she'd plotted to assassinate the 90-year-old Zimbabwean leader as ""ridiculous."" Mugabe also fired eight Cabinet ministers, Zimbabwe's Chief Secretary to the Cabinet Misheck Sibanda said in a statement. Sibanda said Mugabe had dismissed his vice president ""because her conduct had become inconsistent with her official duties."" The firing of Mujuru -- long expected to replace Mugabe -- came after she issued a statement dismissing claims by Mugabe that she plotted with the opposition and the West to kill him as not having ""one iota of evidence."" Of the eight sacked ministers, including a junior minister, Sibanda said: ""It had become apparent that their conduct and performance were below the expected conduct."" 'Plotting to kill' The political upheaval erupted last week when Mugabe accused Mujuru of trying to topple him and of being a ""thief"" of minerals. ""Wanting a post should not lead someone into plotting to kill,"" he said in reference to Mujuru, while opening his ruling Zanu PF party's congress in the capital, Harare. A day earlier, he told his party's central committee that Mujuru, a Zanu PF member, was working with the West to oust or assassinate him. Mujuru was seen as the likely successor to Mugabe until recently, when first lady Grace Mugabe accused her of being ""too dull"" and ""too corrupt"" to lead. Analysts now say the first lady is being groomed to succeed her husband, the only leader Zimbabweans have known since the country gained independence from Britain in 1980. On Saturday, she was confirmed as the leader of the powerful women's wing of Zanu PF. Mugabe: 'I still have the will' At the same time, Mugabe has ruled out leaving politics, despite his advanced age. ""I still have a bright mind, I still have the will,"" Mugabe said as he officially closed his party's five-day congress late Saturday, in a speech that lasted about an hour. He said he would announce a new lineup of Zanu PF leaders by this Thursday. ""We will do a reshuffle. There will be disappointments. Those who are not here have said goodbye to us,"" he said, referring to Mujuru and her allies, who have been snubbing most party leadership meetings since the public attacks against her. Under the new constitution of Zanu PF, Mugabe handpicks the entire leadership of his party.","Robert Mugabe fires his deputy, days after accusing her of plotting to kill him .

"More than 150 people were arrested in a four-month nationwide roundup of alleged sellers and makers of synthetic drugs, substances that authorities say can be more dangerous than the drugs they mimic, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said Wednesday. Federal, state and local agencies collaborated on the arrests, targeting drugs such as synthetic marijuana -- often sold online and labeled as incense to hide its purpose -- and hallucinogens and stimulants sold under the guise of ""bath salts"" or ""plant food,"" the DEA said. Authorities seized hundreds of thousands of synthetic drug packages and more than $20 million in cash and assets in the 29-state, January-to-May roundup, which the DEA said was the second phase of an operation called Project Synergy. ""Many who manufacture, distribute and sell these dangerous synthetic drugs found out first hand today that DEA will target, find and prosecute those who have committed these crimes,"" DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said, adding the agency was targeting those ""who are all too willing to experiment on our children and young adults."" Synthetic drugs are a wide range of chemical products with ever-changing -- and often dangerous -- ingredients. Synthetic marijuana, for example, can be plant material treated with psychoactive compounds that mimic marijuana's active ingredient. Authorities and researchers have said synthetic drugs are particularly dangerous because their ingredients can be particularly potent and haven't been tested for safety. Users of bath salts  sometimes have violent episodes, extreme paranoia and disorientation, the DEA says. In the roundup's first phase, authorities arrested more than 227 people from December 2012 to June 2013, the DEA said.

"On the Sunday after the Newtown massacre, President Barack Obama traveled to Connecticut to comfort the grieving community. As the president offered what he could to the town, other American communities, in less visible ways, were grappling with their own menace of violence. In Camden, New Jersey -- a city that has already suffered 65 violent deaths in 2012 , surpassing the previous record of 58 violent deaths set in 1995  -- 50 people turned out, some bearing white crosses, to mourn a homeless woman known affectionately as the ""cat lady""  who was stabbed to death (50 of the deaths so far this year resulted from gunshot wounds.) In Philadelphia, on the same Sunday, city leaders came together at a roundtable to discuss their own epidemic of gun violence; the year-to-date total of homicides is 322.  Last year, 324 were killed. Of those victims, 154 were 25 or younger. A councilman at the roundtable asked, ""How come as a city we're not in an outrage? How come we're not approaching this from a crisis standpoint?"" The concerns go beyond Philadelphia. In the week following the Newtown massacre, there were at least a dozen gun homicides in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and St. Louis alone. In a year of highly publicized mass shootings, inner-city neighborhoods that are plagued by gun violence have continued to be neglected and ignored. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, large metropolitan areas account for more than two-thirds of deaths by gun violence each year, with inner cities most affected. The majority of the victims are young, ranging in age from their early teens to mid-20s, and black. To track these violent deaths, many communities and media organizations have set up agonizing online trackers -- homicide watches or interactive maps -- that show each subsequent victim as just another data point. These maps are representative of a set of issues far larger than the nameless dots suggest. In the immediate aftermath of Newtown, as politicians and public figures across America grapple with the horrible truths of gun violence, far less visible from the national spotlight is the steady stream of inner-city victims. The media is fixated, and with justification, on the string of high-profile massacres that have rocked the nation in Aurora, Colorado; Tucson, Arizona; Virginia Tech; and now in Newtown. Yet in many of America's neighborhoods most affected by the calamity of gun violence, there is a warranted exasperation -- residents are tired, tired of the ubiquity of guns, tired of fearing for their children's safety, tired of being forgotten. Critiquing a narrow media focus doesn't deny the horrible, tragic nature of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School; mass shootings, however, make up only a small fraction of America's shockingly high level of gun crime. In his study ""American Homicide,"" Randolph Roth showed that while the overall risk of being murdered is higher in America than it is in any other first-world democracy, homicide rates vary drastically among groups. According to Roth, if current trends are maintained, one out of every 158 white males born today will be murdered, but for nonwhite males it is likely one of every 27 born today will be murdered. The stark difference in these racial trends can be traced to the high levels of racial segregation in America's cities, which have created a spatial barrier between poor inner-city youths of color and more mainstream America -- a barrier that is often responsible for the lack of media and political attention paid to inner-city problems. Many experts claim that actually it is the spectacular nature of mass shootings that naturally magnifies media coverage and explains the resonance of these tragedies to the broader public. Inner-city violence on its own, however, does not suffer from a lack of awful, spectacular violence and calamity. In fact, the gruesome nature of violence in inner cities has contributed to widespread social desensitization to gun violence. How then do we explain the differing public responses? An indicator of the difference of attention levels lies in the tone of the public rhetoric in the wake of mass shootings: ""This was supposed to be a safe community,"" and ""This kind of thing wasn't supposed to happen here."" These statements imply that in America's leafy-green small towns and suburbs, gun violence is a shocking travesty; it strikes against America's perception of what is acceptable. In contrast, gun violence in the American metropolis has been normalized, and the public and media display a passive indifference toward the lives of inner-city youths. This normalization of inner-city violence is due in part, to the isolation and segregation of America's ghettos from wider America, but it is also due to a sense that the victims of inner-city violence are responsible for their own condition. As Robert Sampson, a professor at Harvard University, has highlighted, the gun violence in American cities is born out of neighborhood characteristics such as poverty, racial segregation and lack of economic opportunity.  This shortened explanation for the high levels of inner-city violence has often been mistaken to imply that it is the direct choice of inner-city residents to remain either in poverty or in their segregated community that leads to their victimization. In reality, the victims of inner-city gun violence are the victims of a dual tragedy. The first is that the poverty and segregation, which play a crucial role in spurring the downward cycle of crime, are the result of social arrangements predicated on longstanding oppression and prejudice. Through a complex mix of violence, institutional arrangements and exploitation, black Americans were pressured into ghettos, which are the hotbeds of contemporary gun violence. Their inability to escape their conditions is not a choice but rather the byproduct of continued structural discrimination. Slowing the tide of inner-city deaths through gun control is therefore a modern-day civil rights issue. If the refusal of America's national politicians to move on gun control before Newtown represents a political failure and a paucity of American will, then the disregard for the lives of inner-city youths stricken by gun violence on a daily basis is an illustration of the limits of American compassion. The slaughter of young children en masse should be a moment of reckoning for any society, but there is a day-by-day, child-by-child slaughter occurring in America that has gone on too long and is yet to be reckoned with. If Newtown should teach us anything, it is that all of us in America share this same short moment of life, and that we all seek to ensure safety, security and prosperity for our children. As Vice President Joe Biden and the presidential task force meet to negotiate about what new gun laws to recommend, they must look to Sandy Hook Elementary and beyond. We need to protect the children of Newtown from the threat of future gun violence, but the children of Chicago and Camden and Detroit deserve the same long-term security. We may not be able to ensure absolute security for America's children, but through smarter policy America can surely save more of its children from gun violence.

"A bipartisan group of women senators waded into the ongoing drama over the NFL, Ray Rice and domestic violence. They sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell calling on the football league to institute a ""real zero-tolerance policy"" in such cases. The 16 signatories wrote that they were ""shocked and disgusted"" by the in-elevator video that surfaced of Ray Rice punching his then-fianceé in an elevator, and they pointed to the allegation that the NFL had possession of the video, which became public Monday, when it handed down its original lenient two-game suspension. ""The NFL's current policy sends a terrible message to players, fans and all Americans that even after committing a horrific act of violence, you can quickly be back on the field,"" the senators wrote. The NFL recently changed its domestic violence punishment to a minimum suspension of six games for a first offense and a lifetime time ban for a second offense. ""If you violently assault a woman, you shouldn't get a second chance to play football in the NFL,"" the senators wrote. Sen.

"George Zimmerman can now add ""painter"" to his resume after the former neighborhood watchman purportedly listed an original painting on eBay. The 18-by-24-inch canvas features a blue, waving American flag with the words, ""God, one nation, with liberty and justice for all"" emblazoned across it. The auction was posted Monday at a starting bid of 99 cents and is scheduled to end Saturday. As of Tuesday night, 108 bids were logged for the painting, ratcheting the price up to $110,100. The next bid would top $110,200. Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., confirmed that George painted the piece. ""Everyone has been asking what I have been doing with myself. I found a creative, way to express myself, my emotions and the symbols that represent my experiences,"" the item description reads. ""My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors."" Zimmerman appears to respond directly to questions sent about the item. ""Just wanted to tell you we all love you and stand behind you. You have so many people on your side I hope you know that!"" a commenter wrote on the eBay page. ""Thank you so much for the words of kindness and support,"" reads the answer. ""I do know how many great Americans are still here, I run into at least 3-5 a day that go out of their way to tell me the same. Your Friend, GZ."" Photos were added to the auction, including one of a grinning, flannel-clad George Zimmerman holding the painting. The listing states the piece will be sent via expedited shipping from Sanford, Florida. No returns or exchanges are allowed, it says. One individual appears to have retracted a bid of $99,666 on Monday. Zimmerman has been in and out of the spotlight since his July acquittal in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012. Last week, Florida prosecutors said they would not charge Zimmerman after a domestic dispute with his girlfriend in November resulted in his arrest. Previously, he was stopped several times for speeding.

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's central bank says it will soon introduce a 100 trillion dollar note as the once prosperous country battles to keep pace with hyperinflation that has caused many to abandon the country's currency. A boy examines the new $50 billion dollar note issued by Zimbabwe's central bank on January 13, 2009. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said the new notes that includes 50 trillion, 20 trillion and 10 trillion would be released for the ""convenience of the public,"" according to statement released Thursday. ""In a move meant to ensure that the public has access to their money from banks, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has introduced a new family of bank notes which will gradually come into circulation, starting with the 10 trillion Zimbabwe dollar,"" the bank said in its announcement. The new 100 trillion dollar bill would be worth about $300 in U.S. currency. A loaf of bread in Zimbabwe now costs about 300 billion Zimbabwean dollars -- and like most commodities, the price increases every day. Earlier this month, Zimbabwe introduced a 50 billion dollar bill as the country battles to fight cash shortages stemming from the world's highest inflation rate. The official rate was 231 million percent as of July. The currency is in free fall, forcing traders to peg their prices to international currency to hedge against losses. The Zimbabwean dollar is facing extinction, with most traders now accepting other countries' notes, claiming that they import their products. Even vegetable vendors prefer the U.S. dollar, South African rand or Botswanan pula, and most workers now demand their salaries in foreign currency. Doctors and nurses have been on strike since last September, demanding salaries in U.S. dollars. The strike coincided with a cholera epidemic that now has claimed more than 2,000 lives. Last week, the state media reported that most teachers had left their jobs. As a result, the end-of-year examinations taken in November are yet to be graded after the markers demanded their wages in foreign currency. Schools are yet to re-open this year awaiting the examination results.","New 100 trillion dollar bill would be worth about $300 in U.S. currency .

"Beyonce broke some ground with her straight-to-iTunes surprise album, and now she is also reaping the benefits of her strategy. According to Billboard, the self-titled album ""is all but guaranteed a No. 1 debut."" On Monday, iTunes announced the album has become the fast-selling worldwide on its site ""with an unprecedented 828,773 albums sold in just its first three days."" ""Beyoncé,"" which is the superstar's fifth studio album, also broke iTunes' first-week sales record in the United States, with more than 600,000 copies sold. Billboard's Keith Caulfield notes such sales are a huge achievement given that the album has only been available for a few days. ""All of (Beyonce's) previous albums were released on a Tuesday, the traditional day when albums are released each week,"" he writes. ""Thus, a Tuesday release would receive six days of sales in their debut week. But, since 'Beyonce' dropped at midnight on a Friday, its sales are more staggering, since they are just from a little more than three days."" The release may be the singer's biggest debut to date. Her most successful first week performance so far was her second album, ""B'Day,"" which debuted at No. 1 with 541,000 sold in 2006, according to SoundScan. ""Game changer"" has been a much used term with both Beyonce's ""visual album"" and the way in which it was released. With 14 songs and 17 music videos, ""Beyonce"" was released on iTunes with no fanfare or marketing push -- just a social media announcement that it had arrived. The way Beyonce was able to leverage social media while also keeping the digital project a secret means that the singer's latest is garnering even more buzz than it would have if it were a traditional label release. ""Firstly, the fact that she recorded and then released it completely unbeknownst to everyone means that the reception it'll receive is going to be even more jubilant, more outrageous than it would've been, which is actually hard to imagine given the veracity and enthusiasm of Beyonce fans to begin with,"" writes Dale Neuringer of the site Bustle. ""However, because there's been no lead up marketing plan, you can bet your sweet Beyonce that everyone and their mother will be buying the album as soon as possible to see what the hype is about."" Claire Suddath from Bloomberg Businessweek wrote, ""The mechanics and philosophy behind the star's album release aren't groundbreaking"" given that acts such as Radiohead have released albums with only a few days' notice while David Bowie quietly released his first album in a decade via his website. The difference in this case, however, is that Beyonce is a megastar who could easily have the full machine of a record label backing her if she so chose. ""For a long time, the music industry was breaking down at the edges -- an indie band's album leak here, a free hip-hop mixtape there, not to mention the small but consistent drop in sales every quarter,"" Suddath writes.""

"As the opening of next month's Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, approaches, the controversies surrounding the games seem to accumulate by the day. These have included criticism of Russia's human rights record, particularly its treatment of homosexuals, its environmental policies and, with the recent suicide bombings in Volgograd, its anti-terrorism actions and strategy in the Caucasus. Calls to boycott the games and other international pressure have led Russia to release high-profile dissidents including Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the ex-oil tycoon, and members of the punk band Pussy Riot. Yet for all the heat generated in these controversies, one of the most significant issues of all surrounding the Olympics has been nearly ignored: Recognition of the indigenous people of Sochi, the Circassians. The Circassians, who are mostly Muslim, resided in Sochi for millennia. In the 19th century, an expanding Russian Empire coveted their territory -- which is south and east of Russia proper -- and used overwhelming force to defeat them. Russia killed around 1.5 million Circassians and expelled a similar number, mostly to the Ottoman Empire, with many dying of famine and disease. Entire tribes were decimated; for example, the Shapsugh tribe was reduced from 300,000 to 3,000 people. The bloodiest battle of all, which Circassians refer to as their ""last stand,"" occurred in the vicinity of Sochi, the Circassian capital, in 1864. The Circassians describe the catastrophe that befell their people as the first modern genocide. The few Circassians able to remain in the Caucasus found themselves a minority in their own land, which was quickly settled by Russians. Those who were expelled or escaped were forced to migrate from country to country in search of safety and stability. Diaspora Circassians have faced huge challenges in attempting to preserve their identity and traditions and keep the memory of their homeland alive. When it was announced that Sochi would host the 2014 Winter Olympics, there was an outcry among Circassians, who were profoundly insulted that the games would be staged on the graves of their ancestors, almost exactly 150 years after the Sochi ""last stand."" Circassians launched global campaigns of protest amidst reports of human remains being discovered at Olympic construction sites. The Circassians complained of intimidation by the Russians, who, for example, last month arrested eight prominent Circassian activists in the Caucasus, all of whom were respected public figures. The Circassians found it intolerable not only that Sochi was selected to host the Olympics, but also that Russia did not seem to acknowledge that Circassians even lived there. When President Vladimir Putin delivered his bid for the games in a speech to the International Olympic Committee in 2007, he said that the Sochi area used to be inhabited by ancient Greeks and did not mention the Circassians. This is noteworthy because not only did the Circassians live in the region at the time of the Greeks and maintain close ties with them, but they actually participated in the original Olympic games. Russia's indifference towards its indigenous people sharply contrasts with Canada's policy at the last Winter Olympics in Vancouver in 2010. Then, for the first time in history, the native peoples of the area were made official hosts of the Olympics and were involved in every aspect of the games. A depiction of an inukshuk, an indigenous landmark and symbol, was featured as the official logo of the Olympics. The governments of Canada and British Columbia contributed millions of dollars to centers that educated visitors about indigenous culture and history. Other recent Olympics, for example in Salt Lake City in 2002, also prominently featured the native peoples of that area. Despite Russia's failures on the Circassian issue, Putin still has time to act. He has already taken the crucial step of allowing protests at the Olympics, and protesters, Circassian and otherwise, must be allowed to freely express themselves to the world's media. Putin can also push for an acknowledgement of the Circassians at the opening ceremony and speak on the issue. A serious and sincere acknowledgment of the Circassians would help demonstrate to the world that Putin is serious about his vision of a modern and multiethnic ""new Russia."" The United States and Australia have officially apologized for the horrors they inflicted on indigenous peoples, and by taking positive action at the Sochi Olympics, Russia can move in a similar direction. Perhaps such a gesture of respect could help the nation find a solution to the festering problem of the Caucasus, where areas to the east of Sochi, such as Dagestan and Chechnya, remain in a state of war and hopelessness. It is impossible to bring back the mass numbers of Circassians killed at Sochi and the surrounding region in the 19th century. What Russia, and all of us, can do is remember and honor them. By doing so, we affirm the important role that indigenous peoples must play in the 21st century, and also help ensure that the destruction of an entire people never happens again.","Frankie Martin: Sochi's indigenous people largely ignored in run-up to Olympics .

"Dozens of armed men seized the regional government administration buildings in Ukraine's southern Crimean region Thursday and raised the Russian flag in a challenge to the Eastern European country's new leaders. Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula with an ethnic Russian majority, is the last big bastion of opposition to the new political leadership in the capital, Kiev, after President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster Saturday. The seizure, coming a day after Russia ordered surprise military exercises on Ukraine's doorstep, has raised fears about the push and pull of opposing allegiances in a country sandwiched between Russia and the European Union. There's a broad divide between those who support developments in Kiev -- where parliament was voting on an interim West-leaning, national unity government Thursday -- and those who back Russia's continued influence in Crimea and across Ukraine. Yanukovych issued a defiant statement to Russian news agencies condemning the interim government in Kiev and calling everything happening now in the Ukrainian parliament illegitimate, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported Thursday. According to RIA Novosti, anonymous government sources said Thursday that Yanukovych was in Russia and that Russian authorities have accepted his request for security. A warrant has been issued for his arrest in Ukraine. Yanukovych will give a news conference Friday in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, Russian state media reported. If so, it would be the first time he's been seen in public since fleeing Kiev. CNN has not independently confirmed Yanukovych's whereabouts. Secession fears about Crimea . Concerns are building that the tensions in the autonomous Crimean region might escalate into a bid for separation by its Russian majority. Pro-Russian members of the Crimean parliament dismissed the government of Crimean Premier Anatolii Mohyliov in a vote of no confidence Thursday, his spokesman Andrey Demartino told CNN. He said Mohyliov would respect the parliament's decision, despite many procedural irregularities. The lawmakers also voted for a referendum on May 25 on greater autonomy for the region within Ukrainian territory, he said. Only pro-Russian lawmakers were present in the parliament building, still occupied by apparently pro-Russian gunmen. Demartino quoted Mohyliov as saying the responsibility for Crimea's future stability rests with parliament. Crimea was handed to Ukraine by the Soviet Union in 1954. Just over half its population is ethnic Russian, while about a quarter are Ukrainians and a little more than 10% are Crimean Tatars, a group oppressed under former Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Many are struggling to come to grips with the rapid political upheaval, and scuffles have broken out between rival groups -- one pro-Russian and the other supporting the new authorities in Kiev -- in the Crimean capital of Simferopol. New Ukraine Prime Minister's appointment . Back in Kiev, lawmakers approved opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the Batkivshchyna, or Fatherland, party as Prime Minister. Yatsenyuk, who has been both economic and foreign minister in past governments, told reporters that Yanukovych ""is no longer the President, he is the person under investigation and accused of crimes against humanity,"" state news agency Ukrinform reported. The new Prime Minister told parliament that he cannot promise to turn things around quickly and that there is likely to be pain in the short term as the cash-strapped country seeks to get back on track. He also made clear that he believes the country's future rests in closer ties to Europe, not Russia. ""The key task for the Ukrainian government is European integration,"" he said. ""It means a visa-free regime for the Ukrainian citizens, and it means an agreement with the European Union on political and economic integration; agreement on a fully fledged free trade zone. The future of Ukraine is in Europe, and Ukraine will become a member of the European Union."" Yanukovych's decision to scrap a European Union trade deal in favor of one with Russia prompted the protests, which began in November. Those protests devolved last week into bloody street clashes between demonstrators and security forces that left more than 80 people dead. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said Thursday her organization was ready to respond to a request for assistance from Ukrainian authorities and would send a fact-finding team to Ukraine to assess the situation and discuss potential reforms. ""We are also discussing with all our international partners -- bilateral and multilateral -- how best to help Ukraine at this critical moment in its history,"" she said. Ukrainian authorities anticipate the country will need about $35 billion in foreign assistance by the end of 2015. U.S. concerns about Russian military exercises . As Ukraine's interim leaders work to restore stability, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, speaking at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Belgium, urged all parties to avoid ""provocative actions"" in Ukraine. And he warned that the United States was keeping a sharp eye on Russia in light of its recent moves. ""I'm closely watching Russia's military exercises along the Ukrainian border,"" he said. ""I expect Russia to be transparent about these activities, and I urge them not to take any steps that could be misinterpreted or lead to miscalculations."" This, he said, ""is a time for very calm, wise leadership on the Russian side, on everyone's side here."" U.S. officials earlier told CNN that the Russian military exercises were making U.S. military and intelligence agencies concerned that Russia may be positioning ground forces to be able to move across the border into Ukraine if Moscow issued such orders. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has said the exercises are being conducted to check ""combat readiness."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, offered reassurances Thursday that military exercises were previously scheduled and not related to Ukraine. ""We believe that everybody now needs to step back and avoid any kind of provocations, and we want to see in the next days ahead obviously that the choices Russia makes conform to this affirmation that we received today,"" he said after a phone conversation with Lavrov. ""We are also making the same point about reducing tensions in the Crimea to the Ukrainians.  It is very important that the process continue in a thoughtful and respectful way."" Opinion: Will Ukraine's Crimean region be Europe's next 'frozen' conflict? No negotiations . In Simferopol, it was not immediately known who was occupying the government buildings. Mohyliov, the Crimean Prime Minister, told CNN earlier Thursday that the gunmen had refused to speak with him, telling him he had no authority. The men, who stormed the building early Thursday, had made no demands, and it was not clear what they wanted, he said. He added that government security forces, which were outside the buildings, would not use force or weapons to take over the buildings. ""All police in Ukraine have been ordered to be prepared,"" acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov wrote on his Facebook page. ""Orders have been issued to create a cordon around the Parliament in Crimea and to avoid shooting and violence."" A witness, who gave his name only as Maxim, said he saw the armed men run into the building and kick out police. ""Nobody knows what is going on inside at the moment. We only saw the building being taken over,"" he said. He said the men took bags containing antitank weapons, sniper rifles, assault rifles and handguns from buses into the building.

"(CNN) -- Computer applications can drive cars, fly planes, play chess and even make music. But can an app tell a story? Chicago-based company Narrative Science has set out to prove that computers can tell stories good enough for a fickle human audience. It has created a program that takes raw data and turns it into a story, a system that's worked well enough for the company to earn its own byline on Forbes.com. Kristian Hammond, Narrative Science's chief technology officer, said his team started the program by taking baseball box scores and turning them into game summaries. ""We did college baseball,"" Hammond recalled. ""And we built out a system that would take box scores and historical information, and we would write a game recap after a game. And we really liked it."" Narrative Science then began branching out into finance and other topics that are driven heavily by data. Soon, Hammond says, large companies came looking for help sorting huge amounts of data themselves. ""I think the place where this technology is absolutely essential is the area that's loosely referred to as big data,"" Hammond said. ""So almost every company in the world has decided at one point that in order to do a really good job, they need to meter and monitor everything."" Narrative Science hasn't disclosed how much money is being made or whether a profit is being turned with the app. The firm employs about 30 people. At least one other company, based in North Carolina, is working on similar technology. Meanwhile, Hammond says Narrative Science is looking to eventually expand into long form news stories. That's an idea that's unsettling to some journalism experts. Kevin Smith, head of the Society of Professional Journalists Ethics Committee, says he laughed when he heard about the program. ""I can remember sitting there doing high school football games on a Friday night and using three-paragraph formulas,"" Smith said. ""So it made me laugh, thinking they have made a computer that can do that work."" Smith says that, ultimately, it's going to be hard for people to share the uniquely human custom of story telling with a machine. ""I can't imagine that a machine is going to tell a story and present it in a way that other human beings are going to accept it,"" he said. ""At least not at this time. I don't see that happening. And the fact that we're even attempting to do it -- we shouldn't be doing it."" Other experts are not as concerned. Greg Bowers, who teaches at the Missouri School of Journalism, says computers don't have the same capacity for pitch, emotion and story structure. ""I'm not alarmed about it as some people are,"" Bowers said. ""If you're writing briefs that can be easily replicated by a computer, then you're not trying hard enough.""","Tech company created program that turns data into stories .

"In a dramatic turn during her murder trial, newlywed Jordan Linn Graham pleaded guilty Thursday to second-degree murder in a plea deal and recounted how she pushed her new husband over a Montana cliff last summer. ""It was a reckless act,"" she told the judge who demanded the truth of what happened to Cody Johnson, her husband of eight days, in Glacier National Park in July. ""I just pushed,"" she stated. The newlywed couple was arguing when he grabbed her and she told him, ""Let go."" She thought he was going to hold her down. She put one hand on his back and another on his shoulder and then pushed him face-first to his death, she told the court. When Graham declared her guilt, the victim's mother in the gallery crumpled in her seat. Another relative of Johnson, who was 25, threw her head back and cried, whispering ""she said guilty."" His friends held hands and appeared satisfied. Graham, 22, now faces a sentence of up to life in prison, U.S. District Judge Donald W. Molloy said. Her minimum sentence could be 235 months, or 19 1/2 years, though sentencing guidelines are flexible, the judge said. In exchange for her guilty plea, prosecutors dropped a first-degree murder charge and a lying to investigators charge. The deal was announced after the prosecution and defense rested their cases  and took a courtroom break. They hadn't yet begun their closing arguments to the jury. When the trial resumed, the judge said there were new developments, and the prosecution announced a deal had been made. The jury was not in the room when the deal was announced. Lead defense attorney Michael Donahoe said prosecutors offered the deal in the late morning before the lunch break. Graham accepted the deal, he said. When everyone returned to the courtroom, the judge asked Graham if she was sure she wanted to plead guilty, because she could end up spending the rest of her life in a federal prison. Graham consented to the proceeding, though she appeared overwhelmed. She didn't cry, however. When the judge first asked what happened the day her husband was killed, Graham responded, ""I wasn't thinking of where we were."" Then she spoke of the deadly argument and how she had misgivings about the marriage. ""I wasn't really happy,"" she said. She wasn't feeling like one should when first married, she said. When the judge asked her why she left the murder scene, she said she was scared of what had happened. She had the car keys in her pocket. The judge accepted her guilty plea. Graham, a resident of Kalispell, was then handcuffed in the courtroom and taken into custody. Her sentencing is scheduled for March 27, 2014. Another of her attorneys, Andrew Nelson, summed up the trial and its surprise outcome: ""For us, it's been emotional from the drop of the gavel."" A close friend of the victim, Brad Blasdel, was terse about justice in the case as he left the courthouse: ""God'll take care of it."" 'A little creepy': Bride's custom wedding song talks of falling . During the U.S. District Court trial this week, prosecutors contended that Graham was having serious second thoughts about her marriage before her husband's death and willfully lied to police after it. But her defense lawyers argued that the death plunge was an accident resulting from an argument. Graham initially lied to police, they said, because she was afraid she wouldn't be allowed to explain what happened on the cliff's edge. The defense presented to the jury an emotional, heartbreaking review of the couple's wedding video and showed the couple as a normal pair preparing for marriage. Graham's husband disappeared July 7. Four days later, the FBI said, Graham led friends and relatives to a popular spot in the park, where they found Johnson's body. Graham at first maintained that she had simply speculated Johnson might have gone there. But an FBI agent said that she changed her story when she was shown a surveillance photo of the couple entering the park together.

"If you're planning to donate sperm in Kansas, you may want to do it through a doctor. That's one message from the case of William Marotta of Topeka. In 2009, he noticed a Craig's List advertisement from a lesbian couple, also in Topeka, seeking donated sperm. ""Intrigued"" by the ad, he agreed to donate and says he delivered three cupfuls of his sperm -- gratis -- to the women, one of whom gave birth to a daughter. ""I donated genetic material, and that was it for me,"" he told CNN affiliate WIBW. Or so he thought. That changed when the parents separated and one of the women stopped working because of illness and applied to the state for help, he said. The state contacted Marotta for child support. Kansas officials were not persuaded by what Marotta says were agreements he signed before making his donations that he would assume no financial responsibility for the child, who is now 3 years old. The Kansas Department for Children and Families said any agreement would not apply because a physician did not perform the insemination, which Marotta said was news to him. ""I didn't know that there was no doctor involved,"" Marotta said Friday. His lawyer, Ben Swinnen, accused the state, where same-sex marriage is not legal, of being politically motivated in its pursuit of $6,000 from his client. ""The cost to the state to bring this case far outweighs any benefit the state would get,"" he said. Marotta said he met the child once -- a few months ago -- when he and his wife by chance crossed paths with one of the girl's parents at an area carnival. He said he had no intention of assuming a paternal role if he loses the case. ""I'm not her parent,"" he said. But under Kansas law, he is her father. Had a physician carried out the insemination, that would not be the case, because Marotta would be able to document that he was a sperm donor and not the lover of the girl's mother, said CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. ""For all they know, they were lovers,"" she said. ""They need that documentation. He's the dad; he ought to be paying up."" Though a physician would have tested the sperm for sexually transmitted diseases and certain genetic disorders, there are disincentives associated with going through a physician. A single attempt at artificial insemination costs about $3,000, and sometimes several tries are needed. ""It's a lot cheaper to get someone to come on over with their donation, and then do it yourself at home,"" Cohen said. Meanwhile, Marotta owes legal fees and has taken his story to the news media. ""If enough noise gets made about it, at this point, maybe things will change for the better,"" he said. Asked whether, knowing what he now knows, he would answer the advertisement again, Marotta said, ""Probably not.""

"(CNN) -- The tragedy of Ebola is not just its staggering toll. It's also the implicit racism that the deadly virus has spawned. The anecdotes are sickening, particularly a Reuters report this week that children of African immigrants in Dallas -- little ones with no connection to Thomas Duncan, the Liberian Ebola patient who died Wednesday in a local hospital -- have been branded ""Ebola kids"" simply because of their heritage or skin color. In both the United States and Europe, Ebola is increasing racial profiling and reviving imagery of the ""Dark Continent."" The disease is persistently portrayed as West African, or African, or from countries in a part of the world that is racially black, even though nothing medically differentiates the vulnerability of any race to Ebola. A Newsweek cover last month showed a picture of a chimpanzee with the headline: ""A Back Door for Ebola: Smuggled Bushmeat Could Spark a U.S. Epidemic."" Whatever the intent, the picture was wrong. Turns out the story was probably wrong, too, as a Washington Post investigation revealed. The new Ebola outbreak ""likely had nothing to do with bushmeat consumption,"" the Post reported, and there is no conclusive evidence that Ebola has been passed from animals to humans. A theory on animal-to-human transmission with some limited traction centers on dead fruit bats, not chimps. ""There is virtually no chance that 'bushmeat' smuggling could bring Ebola to America,"" the Post concluded. But the damage has been done. And as panic deepens, the danger is that racism -- on planes and public transportation, in lines, on streets, in glances -- deepens further, too. Ebola is a human tragedy, just like enterovirus D68, which causes sudden muscle weakness and severe respiratory problems, particularly among children. It has shown up in almost all the 50 states, with about 500 Americans infected so far, far more than ever. And it has begun to kill, beginning with a 4-year-old boy in New Jersey. Five new cases were reported in New Jersey alone on Tuesday. And there are no antiviral vaccines or cures. Yet enterovirus D68 is known by a scientific name and number. (Unfortunately for Africans, the Ebola virus was named after the Congolese river where the first outbreak was detected). The saga of Thomas Duncan reflects racial perceptions. His girlfriend, Louise, whom he had reportedly been visiting in Dallas, had publicly begged for him to be given the same experimental ZMapp medication given to two (white) American missionaries who were infected in Africa and recently flown back to the United States. ""I'm just asking God and asking the American government for the same medicine they're giving people that come from Liberia,"" she said during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""Please, please, please, please, help me save his life. ...Talk to doctors. They'll find means to get a medicine to cure him. He's so young."" Louise refused to allow her last name to be used for fear of repercussions. Unfortunately, doctors and the pharmaceutical developer said there was no longer any ZMapp left for Duncan or any other victim. But the imagery that accompanied his plight lingers: Whites can be flown to the United States or Europe at any expense, while Africans are left to die unattended on the streets of Liberia or Sierra Leone. Or now, without ZMapp, in Dallas. ""It's easy for the world -- the powerful world, who are largely non-African, non-people of color -- to ignore the suffering of poor, black people,"" Harvard Medical School professor Joia Mukherjee said on PRI's ""The World"" last month. It's easy, she said, to ""other-ize"" the Ebola crisis. Fear too often contorts morality and humanity. Complete coverage on Ebola .","Ebola is increasing racial profiling, says Robin Wright .

"Former Taliban prisoner Bowe Bergdahl will meet Wednesday with an Army general leading the investigation into the sergeant's disappearance five years ago, his lawyer said. Attorney Eugene Fidell wouldn't characterize the upcoming session as an interrogation. He called it an interview and said he assumed it would be ""people sitting around a conference table."" Bergdahl's team spent Tuesday meeting and reviewing documents, some classified. ""I think tomorrow will be an interesting and productive day,"" Fidell said. Bergdahl has met once before, briefly, with Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, the point person for the Army's investigation. After he disappeared in Afghanistan in June 2009, the now 28-year-old soldier spent five years in the hands of Taliban militants. After he was released in May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military, Bergdahl underwent counseling and medical care at a hospital in San Antonio, where he is back on regular duty at Fort Sam Houston. The news of Bergdahl's freedom initially was met with jubilation, but the mood quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity. Some critics accused the soldier of deserting his comrades in war. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent, something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official recently told CNN. Bergdahl works at the headquarters of U.S. Army North in Texas. He is with a unit responsible for homeland defense, civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas. He will eventually be given a position commensurate with his rank of sergeant, the Army said last month. Bergdahl was a private first class when he was captured, and the Army extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while he was in captivity. A grateful Bergdahl 'understands that his life has been saved,' lawyer says .","Bergdahl and Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl have met once before, briefly .
