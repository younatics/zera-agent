Deborah Burlingame, whose father Charles was the pilot of the jet which crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11, said the advert was ‘cruel and truly tasteless’. She said: ‘I find it impossible to believe that any advertiser could be so stupid as to think you can put up a billboard in New York City which shows a human being tumbling down in space and not imagine that this will evoke the tragic memory of those poor souls on 9/11. ‘I think this advertiser has decided that creating a controversy, at the expense of the thousands of people who will be hurt by this image of man falling to his certain death, is worth it.’ Memorable image: The fifth season of Mad Men is currently being filmed although it has already won four Emmy awards and inspired a wave of 1960s fashion .

Celebrity gangster Dave Courtney was punched to the ground and repeatedly hit by his stepson until he said 'let's call it a draw,' a court heard today. Mr Courtney had fallen out with Genson Courtney, 23, over plans to build a 'shack' in his back garden in case his home was repossessed. They went to Plumstead Common, south-east London, to settle their differences but Mr Courtney came off worse, the Old Bailey was told. Less than two weeks later Genson was shot though the eye and killed outside his girlfriend's flat. Fight: Celebrity gangster Dave Courtney, right,  was punched to the ground and repeatedly hit by his stepson Genson Courtney, left, until he said: 'Let's call it a draw,' a court heard today . Prosecutors . claim he was murdered by his uncle David Pinto, 33, who had been . threatened by Genson and wanted him 'eliminated.' The court has heard several people had problems with the victim, who was selling drugs and robbing other dealers. He used steroids as part of his body building routine and suffered from bouts of 'roid rage'. Mr Courtney claimed Genson told him of his plans to rob drug dealers when they were sharing a cell in Belmarsh. 'I . know that Genson had access to firearms and he has asked me if I could . get shotgun cartridges him,' said Mr Courtney in a statement read to the . court. 'He was robbing drug . dealers of the money or drugs or both. If he robbed anyone he would not . wear a mask or cover his face. I heard he was robbing drug dealers on a . regular basis.' Jennifer Courtney, the victim's mother and sister of Pinto, the man accused of murdering his nephew . He said two weeks before Genson was shot, there was a meeting at Mr Courtney's home to discuss his financial problems. Mr Courtney . had written books and appeared in films but his after-dinner speaking . work was drying up and he was having difficulties paying the mortgage. 'Genson . was shouting about the house and our difficulties and I told him I was . going to build a property to the rear of the house,' said Mr Courtney. 'We had purchased some land to the rear of our garden so if things got bad and the house was repossessed then at least we would have somewhere to live. 'Genson may have believed that due to my building skills that it would be something better than a shack and not suitable to live in. 'Genson told me to get my knuckle duster. I think now because I had told him I did not need my duster he might have thought that I was standing up to him and that I was hard enough to take him on without my knuckle duster.' The pair went to the common at the top of the road in Genson's hired car. Mr Courtney said: 'He came out the car and was bouncing around. I said: ""You look like you want to hit me."" Location: Jonathan Rees, QC, prosecuting, said Mr Courtney was shot as he was getting into his car outside his girlfriend's flat in Banning Street, Greenwich . 'I didn't think he would hit me. He was still bouncing around when he punched me in the chin. 'I went down to the ground. I said: 'F** it' and tried to get up and he hit me again. He might have hit me in total about three times. I said to Genson: 'Hold it."" 'I put both my hands up and said: ""Let's call it a draw."" Mr Courtney said a few days later his son set up a meeting with Genson and they made up with a 'man hug.' He said he saw Genson the day before he died. 'He was just himself and didn't appear to be any different and seemed to behave like nothing had happened between us,' said Mr Courtney. The victim was getting into his car in Banning Street, Greenwich, on July 3, 2011 when the gunman shot him dead. Pinto, of Greenwich, and his alleged accomplice Robert Bleach, 45 of Halstow Road, Greenwich, both deny murder. The trial continues.

Paralympian, not in court for hearing, ordered to return passport to court within 24 hours of return . Lawyers say he has no immediate plans to compete . Pistorius no longer has to be supervised by a probation officer as ban on drinking alcohol is lifted . By . Ellen Branagh, Press Association Chief Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:13 EST, 28 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:28 EST, 28 March 2013 . Oscar Pistorius could make a sensational return to the track at this summer's World Championships after a judge today changed his bail conditions as he awaits trial for killing his girlfriend. But UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner said it was ‘very unlikely’ Pistorius would be invited to take part in the London Anniversary Games at the end of July. Lawyers for the 'Blade Runner', who was not in court for the hearing, applied for the conditions to be changed to allow Pistorius to travel abroad to compete. The 26-year-old is on bail after being charged with the premeditated murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot dead at his home in Pretoria last month. Verdict: Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius successfully appealed against some of his bail restrictions on Thursday . Pistorius is likely to stand trial before . the end of the year, the High Court in Pretoria heard today, and his . next court appearance is on June 4. Meanwhile, . Pistorius' agent, Peet van Zyl, said soon after the ruling that his . client could even run at the world championships in Moscow in August and . the IAAF later confirmed he would be allowed to compete. 'Based on this (judge's decision), and if he is up for it and qualifies, . the world championships will definitely be on the radar,' Van Zyl said. 'He's going to be the one that determines running and training. It's his call. He's the one under all the pressure for the . court case and grieving for Reeva.' But speaking to Sky News, Pistorius' uncle Arnold Pistorius indicated that thoughts of a comeback were far from uppermost in the mind of his nephew, who is likely to stand trial before the end of the year and is next due in court on June 4. 'We know Oscar cannot go anywhere in the world because everybody will recognise him. He doesn't want to go anywhere and he doesn't want to go into public life because he's not ready - he's absolutely not ready to do that,' he said. 'Oscar's got no intention to travel overseas now - he needs his family. I can't see him getting along without the support of his family.' Pressed further on whether his nephew could return to the track soon, he replied: 'Not in the near future. Not realistic. I don't think so.' Winner: Pistorius celebrates his victory in the men's 400m - T44 during last year's Paralympic Games . Golden boy: Pistorius (centre) after winning the men's 400m T44 final at the Paralympics . Arnold Pistorius admitted, however, . that it was only a matter of time before Oscar would have to return to . the track if he is to retain any chance of competing on the global . stage. 'In the future, perhaps yes. I would like to say that,' he said. 'Knowledgeable people tell me that if . a super athlete doesn't train for a year, he'll never get back to what . he was, so we tried to convince him to get back into training. 'He knows that he'll have to do that. If he ever wants to run again he'll have to get back to training, . otherwise he will just not be able to get back on track.' The judge also ruled in favor . of Pistorius on three other conditions. He no longer has to be regularly . supervised by a probation official and a ban against him drinking . alcohol was lifted. Bam also slammed one of the bail conditions imposed by another judge, saying that a condition that he would be in breach of his bail if he was accused of another crime against women was 'fraud.' It went against Pistorius' constitutional right to be innocent until proven guilty, and being accused of a crime should not count against him, Bam said in a ruling that came three hours after the hearing began. Pistorius, a double amputee and . six-time Paralympic sprint champion, claims he shot 30-year-old Ms . Steenkamp after mistaking her for an intruder. Change: Pistorius's defence team led by Barry Roux (left) successfully appeal against bail conditions imposed on their client. The Paralympian (below) was not in court on Thursday . May 25: Manchester Great City Games (against British sensation Jonnie Peacock) July 20: IPC World Championships, Lyon . July 28: Anniversary Games, Olympic Stadium . He was released on bail by magistrate . Desmond Nair last month on a number of conditions, including having to . surrender his passport and to report to police twice a week. His lawyer Barry Roux today asked . for several conditions to be relaxed, saying Pistorius - who has been . staying with relatives - was effectively under 'house arrest'. Judge Bert Bam granted the appeal, . saying there was no reason Pistorius should not be allowed to leave the . country if he was invited to compete abroad. But the star must provide a copy of his itinerary to officials before he plans to travel, the judge ruled. Earlier this week Ms Steenkamp's parents June and Barry spoke of their grief over her death. Murder charge: Pistorius says he killed Reeva Steenkamp accidentally when he fired shots through a door in his bathroom . Mrs Steenkamp told Grazia magazine: . 'He (Pistorius) still has his thoughts. He still has to answer for this. I don't want anything from him. What could he say to me? My daughter is . dead and nothing is going to change that. I don't ever want to see him. 'My biggest regret is that Reeva will never have a wedding day. She'll never have a child. This is for ever. It's the end.' Pistorius's brother Carl yesterday . appeared in court in a separate case, in which he is charged with the . culpable homicide of a female motorcyclist in a 2008 road crash. He pleaded not guilty and is due to appear in court again next week.

Outdoor warmth: Despite the unpredictable British climate, one in ten households have a heated hot tub in their garden (file picture) At one time the only accessories you needed for a back garden were a few tools, a lawnmower and a shed to store them in. But nowadays more and more Britons are digging up their flower beds to make way for luxury hot tubs and outdoor spas. Despite the unpredictable British climate, one in ten households have a heated hot tub in their garden - and the British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association says sales actually increase in years of cold weather. The craze for outdoor bathing is highlighted in a survey of 2,000 homeowners carried out by OnePoll for Lloyds TSB Insurance, which found that 10 per cent of respondents now owns a hot tub. The report found that people are furnishing their outdoor spaces with increasingly expensive equipment - and the average UK garden is now worth £1,928. Some 57 per cent of householders said they use the garden as a place to relax, rather than to cultivate plants. Other luxury purchases include summer houses, outdoor dining areas and children's play areas. Meanwhile sales of outdoor plants are declining, with the Garden Centre Association Barometer of Trade recording a 15 per drop between January and June 2012. Hot tubs have been in the UK since the 1970s, the craze for outdoor bathing having made its way to Britain from Scandinavia via America, but sales have taken off in the last decade. On the fall: Sales of outdoor plants are declining, with the Garden Centre Association Barometer of Trade recording a 15 per drop between January and June 2012 (file picture) Paula Tanner, 47, a nurse who lives with her husband in Brighton, converted part of her garden into a leisure area with a spa after her children left home two years ago. 'Time-poor homeowners': Frances Tophill, presenter of ITV's Love Your Garden, said she hopes 'the traditional image of the flower-filled Great British garden is not beginning to wilt' 'I'm always outside,' she said. 'The hot . tub is always a talking point when friends come round and is great for . parties!' Not everyone, however, is thrilled at the new penchant for an . outdoor soak. Neighbours' hot tubs and noisy late-night spa parties were listed among the top 10 most common causes of 'garden rage' by BBC Gardeners' World magazine last year. The magazine cited complaints about 'students acting like three-year-olds' and 'groups of middle-aged women shrieking'. The OnePoll survey found that 20 per cent of respondents in the West Midlands owned a hot tub, compared to 12 per cent in London, 7 per cent in the North East, 4 per cent in Scotland and 2 per cent in Northern Ireland. Prices range from around £3,000 for a basic hot tub, to over £17,500 for a 14-foot model, with running costs starting at £1 a day. Frances Tophill, presenter of ITV's Love Your Garden, said: 'We don't often get a chance to peek over the garden fence of the nation. 'But as homeowners become too time-poor for gardening, features like decking, summer houses and leisure items have moved into prime position in our back gardens. 'Whilst it is positive that we are valuing our outdoor spaces more, I hope the traditional image of the flower-filled Great British garden is not beginning to wilt.'","People furnishing outdoor spaces with increasingly expensive equipment .

He joined them at a club, they chatted all night and she soon phoned a childhood friend in a ‘smitten’ state, reported the Los Angeles Times. She went back in October 2009, he proposed over the phone in November and they held the wedding while he had a pending visa application. ‘It's not like I was trying to marry an American,’ Mr Messam said. ‘It could be anybody else - as long as someone came around just like Jenny.’ Sadness: Jenny Messam's child Asher Ronen Messam is now aged six months and is yet to meet his father, who is still back in Jamaica .

But India's athletes had the limelight stolen from them as they filed through the Olympic stadium during the opening ceremony - by an imposter who slipped through one of the tightest security operations Britain has ever seen. The woman looked conspicuous in a red top and turquoise trousers as she walked with the team, who were all wearing yellow turbans or saris. London 2012 chairman Lord Coe today confirmed that she was an 'over-excited' volunteer cast member who had already taken part in the ceremony.

India's acting chef-de-mission Muralidharan Raja said: 'She had no business being there. It was a clear case of intrusion. 'We are taking up the issue with the organisers. 'We don't know who she is and why she was allowed to walk in. It is a shame that she was walking with our athletes.' Asked . whether it was a security breach, Mr Raja said: 'I can't say that as . she was in a sanitised zone, but this was bizarre. We will ask for an . apology. Stealing the limelight: The woman walked at the front of the Indian contingent, just to the left of flag-bearer Sushil Kumar . 'She embarrassed us in front of the world. The Indian contingent was shown (on television) for just 10 seconds, and to think this lady hogged all the limelight.' Mr Raja, asked if he believed the woman was an Indian, said: 'She could be Asian, Latin American, I don't know.' India has fielded its largest Olympic contingent of 81 athletes with hopes of bettering its Beijing Games tally of one gold and two bronze medals.

Eva Schloss was 23 years old when her mother Fritzi married Otto Frank, making her the posthumous stepsister to Anne Frank, who had died eight years earlier in a concentration camp. Like the Frank family, Eva and her family were discovered hiding in Amsterdam, arrested by Nazi soldiers and sent to a concentration camp when Eva was just 15. Eva and her mother survived the notorious Auschwitz camp in Poland, her father and brother didn't. On their return to Amsterdam Fritzi fell in love with Otto Frank, the only member of the Frank family to survive the Holocaust, and they married in 1953. Scroll down for video . Eva Schloss, stepsister of Anne Frank, appeared on This Morning to discuss her biography, After Auschwitz . Anne and her sister Margot both died of Typhus while prisoners in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. And once the diary was discovered in the Amsterdam house that the family spent two years hiding in, Anne became one of the most discussed victims of the Holocaust. While the rest of the world paid tribute to the teenage storyteller years and even decades later, Eva found living in her dead stepsister's shadow incredibly difficult. This week Eva released her second biography, After Auschwitz, which describes the good and bad influence Anne's legacy has had on her own life. Today the 83-year-old, who now lives in London, appeared on This Morning to talk about a life spent living with a ghost. Eva said: 'I used to know her when we . were 11 years old. She was quite different from me. I was a tomboy and . she was already quite a sophisticated little girl. 'She liked to tell stories and she liked to be the centre of attention and have people around her. 'At . school she was called ""Mrs Quack Quack"" because she talked so much, . she even got given lines to write: ""I must not talk in class.""' 'There were a few families that went into hiding and fortunately quite a few survived. 'Both . of our families were betrayed. In our case we knew who betrayed us. It was a Dutch nurse. it will never be known who betrayed the Franks.' Anne Frank, pictured here with her family, became one of the most discussed victims of the Holocaust after her diary was discovered hidden in a house in Amsterdam . Because of coverage on . the war by the BBC teenager Eva had heard about the 'work camps' and . what they represented before she and her family were arrested. But . she told This Morning hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield that . she wasn't actually very scared when she was captured. She . said: 'When we were arrested we still had hope that we might be sent to . a real work camp, because the Germans still needed workers. We were . scared but we didn't know yet ... but once we arrived in Auschwitz, we . knew.' 'In Auschwitz there was starvation, . filth, illness, hard work and selection. We knew selection was happening . all of the time. When the camp doctor appeared we knew it was bad news. 'Life was so frightening, you had to be alert all the time, try to go unnoticed ... you always knew that the chance was there.'

It's not a sight you would expect to see in the Vatican but these photographs show members of the tiny city state's police undergoing riot training. Dressed in protective overalls with the logo of the Vatican police known as the Gendarmeria, the officers are seen wearing helmets and carrying shields as they are put through their paces by Italian colleagues. The drill took place in the parade square of the police HQ just behind St Peter's and just hours after emeritus Pope Benedict XVI returned to the Vatican and moved into his new 'retirement home' - a converted convent, after spending more than two months at the papal summer residence outside Rome Castelgandolfo. God squad: Vatican police undergo riot training with helmets and shields . A Vatican source who witnessed the . drill from an overlooking window and who asked not to be named, said: . 'It's not something I have ever seen before and I would't really expect . to see the Gendarmeria involving in public disorder situations in St . Peter's.' The . exercise lasted several hours and involved the Vatican police force . moving forward against trainers who acted as rioters throwing bottles, . stones and petrol bombs.

Memoirs: Jenna Miscavige Hill, 28, daughter of David's older brother Ron, has been a frequent critic of the Church of Scientology since publicly breaking with it in 2005 . A niece of controversial Scientology leader David Miscavige is planning a tell-all memoir about her life in the church and how she escaped its clutches. Jenna Miscavige Hill, 28, daughter of David's older brother Ron, has been a frequent critic of the Church of Scientology since publicly breaking with it in 2005. In 'Beyond Belief: My Secret Life inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape', she will reveal 'strange and disturbing' details about growing up in the church and will provide a firsthand . account of Scientology's 'upper ranks', its publishers William Morrow say. In 2000, when she was 16 years old, . Ms Miscavige's parents left Scientology, disillusioned with its . practices. In the five years that followed, she has claimed that - because of the church's . policy of 'disconnection' with relatives and friends who do not support . the cult - all letters between them were intercepted and she was not . allowed to answer the telephone for over a year. 'If you flunked your uniform inspection, sometimes if you were late . . . . you would be dumped with a five-gallon bucket of ice water,' she told investigative journalist Philip Recchia in 2008. 'We were also required . to write down all transgressions . . . similar to a sin in the Catholic . religion. 'After writing them all down, we would receive a meter check on . the Electropsychometer to make sure we weren't hiding anything, and you . would have to keep writing until you came up clean. This is from the . age of 5 until I was 12.' After leaving the church, Ms . Miscavige Hill, with Kendra Wiseman and Astra Woodcraft - both also . raised in Scientology - founded the website exscientologykids.com. Tell all memoir: 'Beyond Belief, left, will reveal 'strange and disturbing' details about growing up in the church.  Ms Miscavige Hill, right has set up a support group to help other Scientologists, current and former . The site was launched as support . group offering 'non-judgmental support for those who are still in . Scientology, discussion and debate for those who've already left, and a . plethora of easy-to-understand references for the curious'. Following . the public split between the cult's most famous member, Tom Cruise, and . wife Katie Holmes, Ms Miscavige Hill spoke out in support of Holmes and . the couple's daughter Suri. 'My . experience in growing up in Scientology is that it is both mentally and . at times physically abusive,' she said in a statement released through . the Ex-Scientology Kids website. 'I was allowed to see my parents only once a week at best – . sometimes not for years. Powerful people: Ms Miscavige Hill's uncle and Scientology leader David .

'We got a lousy education from unqualified . Teachers, forced labor, long hours, forced confessions, being held in . rooms not to mention the mental anguish of trying to figure out all of . the conflicting information they force upon you as a young child. 'While it is very unlikely that Suri Cruise would have the same . upbringing as me (due to her parent's celebrity status), any . organization that is capable of mistreating and neglecting the needs of . children, regardless of their social status, and which has a long . history of breaking up families is no place for an innocent child. Happier times: Following the public split between the organization's most famous member, Tom Cruise, and wife Katie Holmes, Ms Miscavige Hill spoke out in support of Holmes and the couple's daughter Suri (pictured in 2007) 'The people in Scientology who are responsible for ""PR"" are experts at twisting the truth and intimidation tactics. 'As a mother myself, I offer my support to Katie and wish for her . all of the strength she will need to do what is best for her and her . daughter.' She says, since leaving the church, she has been branded a 'suppressive person', which the church’s website defines as someone 'who seeks to suppress other people in their vicinity'. The Scientology website reads: 'A suppressive person will goof up or vilify any effort to help anybody and particularly knife with violence anything calculated to make human beings more powerful or more intelligent. 'The ""suppressive person"" is also known as the ""anti-social personality"". Within this category you would find ‘Napoleon, Hitler, the unrepentant killer and the drug lord,' according to the website. 'Beyond Belief: My Secret Life inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape' will be published by HarperCollins Publishers imprint William Morrow, due out in January. Scientology has been dogged by controversy almost since the day it was created. The belief was founded in 1952 by L Ron Hubbard who until then had been known for writing pulp and science fiction novels. Followers believe that inside them are ancient alien beings known as thetans which have lived for thousands of years on other planets and were brought to Earth on a space ship that looks like a Douglas DC-8 plane. Through a process called Dianetics they make themselves far better people, and even massively boost their IQ. Such claims however have never been proved and instead Scientology has faced allegations it charges outrageous fees for its services and abuses its followers. Among the most controversial aspects are 'audits' in which followers have to explain their inner secrets to a superior, including their sex lives. There have also been reports of bizarre punishments and questions have been raised over what happened to the wife of its current leader David Miscavige, who has reportedly not been seen since 2007. Those who join the higher order of Scientology, known as Sea Org, pledge their allegiance for one billion years - a vow supposedly made by children as young as 10. Scientology courts Hollywood stars and famous followers include Tom Cruise and John Travolta but it is very rare that they speak about their beliefs. Cruise's marriage to Katie Holmes was said to have ended over her refusal to allow their six-year-old daughter Suri to be indoctrinated. She was also said to be concerned about the child being sent to the Scientology Gold Base in California where members are banned from having children, are paid just $50 a week and can be punished for simply looking at somebody the wrong way. Scientology was also the basis of the current cinema hit The Master in which a drifter is taken in by the leader of a cult-like group.","Jenna Miscavige Hill, 28, is the daughter of Scientology leader David Miscavige's older brother Ron .

Veteran BBC football commentator Stuart Hall has admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls, the youngest aged nine. Hall, 83, entered the guilty pleas last month at Preston Crown Court but they can only be revealed today after reporting restrictions were lifted. The sex offences took place between 1967 and 1986. On BBC 5 Live he was a regular football commentator and summariser and provided colourful analysis of matches, often including literary references and allusions. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Stuart Hall arrives at Preston Crown Court today, with solicitor Maurice Watkins, where he has admitted historic sex allegations . Guilty: Hall, pictured arriving at court today, has admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls aged as young as 9 . Despite previous vociferous public . denials of any wrongdoing, Hall calmly and repeatedly answered 'guilty' when the charges were put to him at the hearing on April 16. Sat in front of the dock with his . legal representatives, he confirmed his full name of James Stuart Hall . to the clerk in the plea hearing. He then stood up as he uttered the single damning word which has now ruined his reputation. The Recorder of Preston, Judge . Anthony Russell QC, told him he would be required to sign the Sex . Offenders Register. He was told a notice which he needed to fill in . would be sent to his home in Cheshire within days. An additional charge of rape and three more of indecent assault will lie on file after prosecutors decided not to pursue them following the other guilty pleas. Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for the North West, described the broadcaster as an 'opportunistic predator'. A brief outline of the abuse suffered . by three of his victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was . outlined at an earlier hearing at Preston Magistrates' Court. In the 1980s Hall molested a nine-year-old girl by putting his hand up her clothing. He also kissed a 13-year-old girl on the lips after he said to her: 'People need to show thanks in other ways.' On another occasion in the 1970s he fondled the breast of a girl aged 16 or 17. Hall was charged with those three offences on the same day as was arrested by Lancashire Constabulary on December 5 last year. The BBC said at the time that the . former It's A Knockout presenter would not work for the corporation until the matter was . resolved. He was subsequently charged with historic sex offences against 10 more girls and the rape of a 22-year-old woman. Following those allegations, Hall . read out a strident condemnation to reporters in which he labelled the . claims as 'pernicious, callous, cruel and above all spurious'. He said he had endured 'a living nightmare' and but for his 'very loving family' may have considered taking his own life. BBC Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Stuart Hall pleads guilty to sex abuse of  girls as young as 9. Utterly nauseating! 'Always admired Hall as a broadcaster. Worked with him on occasions. This is just too ghastly!' Sports voice: Hall's commentaries and analysis were famed for featuring literary references and allusions . Presenter: Hall, pictured with his wife Hazel (in the picture right) worked on television as well as radio . 'This is ghastly': Gary Lineker was dismayed at the revelations about Hall (pictured) Hall has been a familiar face and . voice in British broadcasting for half a century and was awarded an OBE . in the 2012 New Year Honours. As well as his work on 5 Live and It's A Knockout, he also wrote a weekly sport column for the Radio Times magazine up until his arrest. Hall was granted bail until his sentencing date on June 17. Judge Russell told him that all sentencing options remain open including immediate custody. Hall's barrister, Crispin Aylett QC, said: 'The defendant is, of course, sorry for what he has done. Through me he wishes to apologise to his victims. 'He is not a man easily moved to self pity but he is only too aware his disgrace is complete.'

Clinch to death with a pair of scissors after flying into a rage . when he refused to help her tidy the house . A woman has been jailed for nine years for killing her fourth husband after fatally wounding him with a pair of scissors when he ignored her command to tidy the house. Sandra Clinch looked to the floor as the jury returned their verdict, dismissing her suggestion that American car enthusiast Alan Clinch’s death was 'a tragic accident'. The jury of six men and six women found Clinch guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and not guilty of Mr Clinch’s murder. The 49-year-old was said to have . flown into a rage after her 'quiet' husband did not immediately stop . tending to the garden and return inside their cottage in the village of . Darite, Liskeard, in Cornwall to tidy up. The . couple were expecting guests for Sunday lunch and Clinch had asked her . husband for help, but he had apparently told her to 'shut up'. Truro . Crown Court heard the fatal wound was caused by dress-making scissors, . which were embedded up to 4in (12cm) into Mr Clinch’s chest, having . first pierced two layers of clothing before puncturing his heart and a . lung. The mother-of-five . told police she had thrown the scissors at her husband, but later . changed her account, saying he had walked into the line of fire. Finally, she told the jury she was unable to recall whether or not she let the scissors go from her hand. Clinch had a history of violence . against her former partners and children, and her eldest son told the . court she would go into a 'rage' when the 'red mist' descended. She . had hysterically begged medics to save her 48-year-old husband, but he . was pronounced dead upon arrival at hospital, around midday on May 13 . this year. 'Purely fanciful': The mother-of-five told police she had thrown the scissors at her husband, but later changed her account, saying he had walked into them by accident . Clinch had . denied murder, and Judge Graham Cottle asked the jury to consider a . second charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished . responsibility or lack of control. Sentencing Clinch, he said: 'You have been convicted by the jury of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. 'Your principal defence of an accident was nothing more than purely fanciful. 'The . jury were satisfied that you were suffering from a personality disorder . at the time you killed and it was that personality disorder that . affected your ability to exercise self-control. 'It . has been a regular feature during your life. The evidence established . beyond doubt you have been aggressive, abusive and violent towards . previous partners as well as your children. 'You stabbed a previous partner with a carving knife and assaulted your children on a regular basis. 'He (Mr Clinch) was a meek, mild-mannered and gentle man, who simply took what you handed out. 'This time, when your temper exploded, you killed somebody: your husband. 'I . have no doubt on that evidence that you intended to hurt him badly and . you embedded scissors in his heart and immediately after you regretted . your actions. 'The sentence I will pass upon you is that of nine years’ imprisonment.' Judge . Cottle told Clinch that while in prison she would have to undertake . work to deal with her violence and lack of self-control. Prosecutor . Paul Dunkels QC said Clinch had not thrown the scissors, but had . stabbed her husband of nearly three years as she lost her temper. After . Clinch showed the jury how she thought she had thrown the shears on . that fatal morning six months ago, Mr Dunkels said: 'You’re searching . for the acceptable demonstration of a throw. 'But . as you didn’t throw the scissors, you have no set picture in your head. That’s why your demonstration (to police and in court) wobbles and . varies so much.' Lethal: Truro Crown Court heard the fatal wound was caused by dress-making scissors (not pictured), which were embedded up to 4in (12cm) into Mr Clinch's chest . Giving evidence, Clinch replied: 'I’m just not 100% sure how I picked them (the scissors) up. It happened in a split-second.' She . said she stopped herself from picking up the sewing machine - a recent . gift from her husband - but just 'grabbed the scissors' instead. Experts . told the jury that severe force would have been required for the blades . to pierce two layers of Mr Clinch’s clothing before imbedding so deeply . into his chest. But Clinch . said she had never intended to seriously injure the 'kind, gentle' Mr . Clinch, described by friends as a quiet man who was known locally for . his charity work. Asked by defence counsel Andrew Langdon QC about how she treated her late husband, Clinch replied: 'Not that well.' She . broke down upon recalling how Mr Clinch - who the defendant’s children . said would often simply walk away from confrontation - would aim to . defuse arguments by putting his arms around hers. She . said: 'If I was shouting at him, he would put his arms around both my . arms. He would usually give me a kiss and I would calm down.' Guilty: Clinch was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but cleared of murder at Truro Crown Court (above) Clinch’s temper frequently got the better of her throughout her life, the court heard. Put into care as a teenager, she became pregnant aged 15 to then-19-year-old Andrew Fazekas. The pair went on to have a second child and a tumultuous four-year marriage. Mr Fazekas read extracts from diaries he said he kept while living with his then-wife, which included accounts of Clinch attacking him with a bread knife, a screwdriver and a dart. The court was told Clinch had also stabbed her second husband, Peter Knibbs, with a kitchen knife, requiring him to undergo major surgery and spend three weeks in hospital, following a spat in 1989. Other witnesses recalled how Clinch had bit a neighbour’s hand during an argument, while Clinch herself admitted driving her car at a teenage man she suspected was a bad influence on one of her children. It prompted one young neighbour in Cornwall to refer to Clinch as 'the Incredible Hulk'. The court also heard Clinch would regularly lose her temper with her own offspring, eventually leading to all five leaving home by the time they were 18. On one occasion, she told her then-13-year-old son Adrian Knibbs to lie to his school about the injuries she inflicted upon him, and also left scarring to his temple when she hit him with a porcelain bowl. And Andrew Lee Fazekas, now 32, said of his mother: '(She) was often a violent person, a red mist would come down and she would suddenly go into a rage that would be over the smallest of things. 'Her rage would then stop like nothing had happened. It was like a light switch.' Clinch’s eldest daughter, 24-year-old Zoe Knibbs, told the jury she called the police on her mother nearly a decade ago after her mother hit her, but did not press charges because she did not want to be taken into care. Her youngest child, 19-year-old Chelsea Lewis, added that her mother had once tried to push her down the stairs, and, on another occasion, threw a glass picture at her head. Speaking of her mother’s arguments with Mr Clinch, Miss Lewis said: 'He (Mr Clinch) would try his hardest to defend himself, but he was weak compared with my mum.'","Sandra Clinch snapped when Alan Clinch did not immediately stop tending the garden .

Terrance Allen faces a sentence of between three and 11 years over the devastating incident that happened during the school run in Akron on January 23. Allen, who was found cradling his son Jamarcus by the side of the road by police officers, also faces charges for not having a license for the firearm. Inconsolable: Tears stream down Terrance Allen's face as he pleads guilty to manslaughter after his four-year-old son shot himself after finding a handgun in the family's car . No details of the shooting were revealed . in court, but police said Jamarcus found a gun in the back seat of his father's car and accidentally . shot himself, according to Ohio.com. Relatives from both sides of the . boy's family were in court for Allen's appearance. As part of his plea . deal the court will hear impact statements from the family. At the time of the shooting it was revealed that Jarmarcus had been told off by his mother only a week before, after being found playing with the gun, which was supposedly hidden in the bathroom wall. Jamella Allen told Ohio.com she had ordered her husband to get rid of the pistol. Although the couple were going through a divorce, they still shared a house with Ms Allen's 18-year-old son Tyree Rugs. Trial: Terrance Allen with his attorney, Rufus Sims, left, faces a judge after his son killed himself . Tragic: Four-year-old Jamarcus Allen was told off for playing with the gun a week before the shooting . According to witnesses, after the . shooting Allen pulled over and flagged down a police car. By the time . the deputy arrived, Allen was cradling his son outside the car. A single bullet hole was allegedly visible in the car's roof, and witnesses said they saw a pool of blood in the foot well. Jamarcus was rushed to Akron Children’s Hospital where he was declared dead. Shortly afterwards, Ms Allen paid tribute to her son, who loved comic book heroes and was always on the move. 'Jamarcus wouldn’t stop. He was so full of life. The only way he would stop was when he would fall asleep. That’s the only thing that would slow him down,' she said. When Allen appeared in court this week, his jaw muscles were tightly clenched and he kept his head bowed. As Summit County Judge Judy Hunter accepted the plea, the father broke down and had to be consoled by his lawyer. Emergency: Terrance Allen flagged police down and cradled his son in his arms after the shooting . Assistant Summit County Prosecutor . Jonathan Baumoel said no . promises had been made about the sentence. Because Allen had a previous burglary charge from 1996 he had been barred from owning a gun. He faces a possible sentence of between nine months to three years for breaking that condition. Because he cannot afford his $350,000 bond, Allen will remain in custody until his sentencing, which is due to take place on July 16.","Terrance Allen was doing the school run when his son found gun in car .

Prince Harry's tour of the US begins in Washington this afternoon before moving on to Colorado Springs, New Jersey and New York before culminating in a charity polo match in Greenwich, Connecticut. He is pictured above playing a game on a visit to a technology institute in Nottingham last month . Prince Charles told the troops: 'I think we owe the families here an enormous debt of gratitude' On a pre-deployment ‘lads’ holiday’ to Las Vegas, the third in line to the throne was photographed playing a game of ’strip billiards’ with a group of women in his £5,000-a-night hotel suite. Harry has always refused to publicly apologise for his antics, which caused huge embarrassment to the Royal Family, but admits he ‘let his family down’. Today he will be hoping to put the incident behind him as he focuses on some of the other great passions in his life – his charitable initiatives. His trip begins on the world-famous Capitol Hill this afternoon where he will view an exhibition staged by the HALO Trust, an anti-landmine charity once championed by his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. Diana sparked an international outcry . 16 years ago when she walked through a live minefield in Angola to . highlight the shocking legacy of anti-personnel landmines in January . 1997, just months before her tragic death. But her subsequent calls for a worldwide ban on landmines sparked a global row over the impartiality of the Royal Family. The senior royal presented Major Simon Beattie with a trophy as the Air Corps' Best Aircraft Commander of the Year . Government ministers reacted with fury, with the then Junior Defence Minister, Earl Howe, describing the princess as ‘ill informed’ and a ‘loose cannon’. The shocked royal rejected their criticism, insisting she was not a political figure but simply wanted to highlight the scale of the humanitarian disaster. ‘I’m only trying to help,’ she said as she cuddled landmine victim Sandra Txijica. The image went round the world, forever linked to the princess and a powerful symbol of the horrors of war. Harry has long been keen to take up his mother’s mantle and in 2010 visited Mozambique to learn more about HALO’s work. During that trip, he meet dozens of people who had lost limbs to landmines and was given the chance to detonate several mines himself, wearing the same protective visor and body armour as his mother. According to aides, he has been looking for a way to support the charity – which is based in Scotland and has cleared more than 1.4 million landmines since 1988 - more formally ever since. Earlier this year, he became patron of their 25th anniversary appeal. During his speech, Charles said: 'If it is any consolation, I understand very well just how many demands are faced by service families when you find yourselves required to go here, there and everywhere at short notice' This evening, the prince will be the guest of honour at a glitzy reception in the gardens of the UK Ambassador’s residence, where he will be introduced to the cream of British society in Washington as well as charity representatives. The ambassador, Sir Peter Westmacott, will be a familiar face as he served as Prince Charles’s deputy Private Secretary between 1990 and 1993. Harry will take time to address the 170 guests, his first speech of the tour, before attending a dinner also thrown by the Ambassador for just 30 guests. Tomorrow, the prince will visit the Arlington National Cemetery, where he will lay a wreath on the graves of those who have recently lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. He will also lay a bouquet of flowers at the grave of legendary murdered former President, JFK. The main focus of his trip, however, will be the 2013 warrior Games in Colorado Springs this weekend which will see more than 200 wounded servicemen – including a 35-strong British team – compete in seven sports including archery, cycling and shooting. The prince will formally open the games and may even take part in them himself. The final leg of his trip will take him to New Jersey, where he will visit an area affected by last year’s Hurricane Sandy, and undertake several engagements in New York including an event on behalf of the British Government. He will be seen boarding an iconic double decker bus to publicise the GREAT campaign, which is promoting Britain as one of the best places in the world in which to visit, study and invest in. Harry will also take part in a baseball game  before moving on to Connecticut where he will take part in a celebrity-studded polo match on behalf of his own charity, Sentebale, which he set up to help AIDS orphans in the impoverished African kingdom of Lesotho. Unlike other members of the Royal Family, the prince will be taking commercial flights to and from the US as well as within it, and has a minimal five-strong entourage plus his security detail. The cost of his trip will be met largely by his charities but in part by taxpayers as he will be conducting some official business. Fortunately for his security team, there will be little chance for time off – and certainly no return visit to Vegas – as he will return to the UK as soon as the trip finishes to resume his military duties.","Charles visited Harry's unit, 662 Squadron, at his son's airbase in Wattisham, Suffolk, to honour troops .

A mother pleaded for help finding her 9-month-old baby who has been missing over two weeks as his father failed to report him missing. Amy Warney called for the public's assistance in locating her son Levon Wameling, who was last seen May 29 by his father in Utica, N.Y. Though police say Levon's father is still not being treated as a suspect, Jevon Wameling, 27, waited nearly two weeks to report his son missing, according to the The Utica Observer-Dispatch. 'I would like to ask anybody that's out there if you know where he is, or if he's alive or dead, just please call the Utica police Station so I can just put him to rest,' Warney said through tears at a news conference Thursday. 'Just please, don't be scared. Just if you know anything, just please contact somebody.' Missing: Police in Utica, N.Y., are searching for missing 9-month-old Levon Wameling . Grief: Amy Warney, left, asked the public to help find her baby, right, 'dead or alive' Delayed: Levon Wameling was reported missing by his grandparents on Tuesday, two weeks after anyone last saw him . Levon's grandparents reported him missing Tuesday to the Oneida County District Attorney Scott McNamara, who immediately notified police, according to WKTV. After his son was reported missing, Wameling told police Levon disappeared two weeks earlier when Wameling left the baby unattended on the front porch wearing nothing but a diaper. Wameling said he left the baby alone while was trying to get back into his home after locking himself. Police said Wameling came forward only after Levon's mother asked where her child was. 'Here’s the thing, we have a problem with what he says,' Utica Chief Mark Williams said at a news conference Thursday. 'Here’s a guy that waited two weeks to come forward. He doesn’t bring it forward to the police, but brings it forward to his parents. Instead he goes to an attorney's office. I think actions speak louder than words.' On Friday, a state police helicopter hovered over the neighborhood where Levon was last seen, according to WKTV. State police K-9 units continued to search the neighborhood, walked to sniff streets and other wooded areas, but the dogs' efforts were hampered by bad weather, The Observer-Dispatch reported. Happy: Jevon Wameling, seen here with his son Levon, was the last person to see him before the baby went missing in May . In addition to state and local authorities, the FBI, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Oneida County District Attorney’s Office have assisted in the search effort. Williams told CNN that the father's delay is only making it harder for them to find the child. 'When you have a missing child, there's all these difficult cases,' he said. 'But when you're two weeks behind, it's nearly impossible.' Despite the father's 'suspicious' behavior, authorities' focus has been to find Levon. 'We obviously have very grave concerns about the child. First and foremost, is where this child?' Utica Police Sgt. Steve Hauck told YNN. 'We need to know what happened. Wherever the evidence leads us is where we're going to go. If we find a crime was committed, then we're going to take appropriate steps to bring that person to justice. But right now, our biggest concern is finding this child.' Though he is not a suspect, police said they are are treating Wameling as a 'person of interest'. 'The last we left it with the father he asked for an attorney and no longer wanted to speak with us,' Williams told CNN Friday. Manhunt: Along with the public's help, investigators with six agencies have contributed to the search for Levon Wameling . Tragedy: Amy Warney, seen with Levon right, was in drug rehab while her baby was staying with his father . Levon was staying with his father while Warney was at a drug rehabilitation facility, police said Friday. 'As far as she knew, the child was being cared for by Jevon and was doing fine,' Hauck told The Observer-Dispatch. Levon's father has a criminal history. Wameling was charged with resisting arrest, escaping police custody and harassment in May 2010 after being arrested for allegedly possessing metal knuckles, according to WKTV. In 2009, he was convicted of marijuana possession. Neighbors told the station the cops were called to Wameling's home on a 'weekly basis' because of screaming. Search: K-9 units and helicopters have been used to try to find Levon Wameling . Police are asking residents in the neighborhood where Levon went missing to search their backyards. 'I think that, more than anything, it’s a starting point,' Hauck told The Observer-Dispatch. 'It makes no sense to start out broad and make the search smaller. It makes the most sense to start small and go bigger.' Police say that they have a lot of leads. Levon has brown eyes, black hair and he is bi-racial, according to his missing poster from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Anyone with any information is asked to call Utica Police at 315-735-3301.","Levon, 9 months old, was last seen by his father Jevon Wameling in May .

Leaping through the air seemingly into an abyss below, freerunner Thomas Couetdic looks certain to fall to his death in the breathtaking landscape of Hampi in India. But Thomas, 28, lands safely on another boulder as he performs death defying jumps from rock to rock - wearing little more than a pair of trousers with no safety harness and no shoes. While most freerunners chose to master their art in urban landscapes, the intrepid parkour expert prefers to hop from rock to rock in the Unesco World Heritage Site. Scroll down for video . Death defying: Thomas Couetdic leaping off a boulder in India without wearing so much as a pair of trainers to cushion his fall . Giant leap: The freerunner looks tiny in comparison to the rocky landscape of Hampi, India . Located within the ruins of Vijayanagara some of the rocks from which Thomas jumps are as big as the average house. Thomas, from Arpajon, France was . travelling around India in search of adventure with friend and London . photographer Andy Day, 32 when they stumbled across the unique . landscape, a hotspot for rock climbers. He said: 'I had been wanting to visit . India for a while. parkour was and always is a good way to meet the . locals and discover the hidden sides of a country. 'Hampi is a paradise. The boulders seem to have been put there for the sole purpose of being climbed and jumped. 'I seized the opportunity to challenge . myself in the way that I like best, by facing obstacles that are as . mental as they are physical. 'Technically, it's not a really hard . jump, if you've trained a bit.

Preparation: The parkour expert is seen climbing up the side of some ruins sizing up his crucial jump before taking the leap . Acrobatic: The summit of rocks in India's Hampi area offered stunning views while the pair were exploring . Don't look down: Photographer Andy captured some stunning shots of Thomas performing his death defying stunt . 'With stress, you tend to push harder, so I had to resist that urge and stay focused on my landing spot. 'The height was the biggest danger of this jump. Falling and dying is usually frowned upon. He added: 'When you train parkour, . you're constantly playing with your fear, and little by little you learn . to control it, to channel it so that it serves you but doesn't paralyse . you. You never get rid of it entirely, nor should you. It's a self . preservation mechanism. 'After some days, people in town start . speaking about the parkour guy who jumps from a boulder to another and I . even end up teaching a class, at the request of some of the foreigners . there, it's a really cool place.' Photographer Andy said that the pair had already explored Italy and met with a variety of parkour enthusiasts and that they wanted to do something similar in India. He said: 'We went simply in search of adventure and experiences.

'While visiting the temple, Thomas spotted a jump that he wanted to do and we decided to return the next day when the light was good. 'With this sort of jump there is of course the chance of injury and potentially, death, but this is incredibly unlikely given the level of training. 'We have a developed understanding of danger and risk. With ten years of experience, the risks are still present but the danger is negated through judgement and physical skill. Talented: Thomas trained extensively with the originators of parkour to learn his trade . 'Sometimes the jump is easy but looks amazing, other times you only get one chance and you have to get it right first time. 'On this occasion, Thomas jumped twice. I'm not sure why he felt the need to repeat it. Possibly because he is a perfectionist and felt that there was something about his first attempt that needed improvement. 'The scale of the location made the photographs that we came back with feel even more satisfying, It was definitely the most rewarding location I've ever photographed.'","Parkour expert Thomas Couetdic rock hopped in the breathtaking landscape of Hampi, India .

Warning: Billionaire Warren Buffett, left, pictured today at a Wall Street mogul conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, said congressional Republicans were being reckless by refusing to raise the debt ceiling . Legendary investor Warren Buffett has accused Republican congressmen of playing ‘Russian roulette’ and trying to ‘blow America’s brains out’ with their defiance on debt. The self-made billionaire accused the GOP-controlled House of Representatives of being reckless by refusing to raise the government borrowing limit beyond $14.3trillion. The Treasury has warned it will run out of money to pay all of the country's bills if the ceiling is not increased by August 2, risking the first-ever U.S. debt default and a second recession. And once against last night, talks . fell apart between President Barack Obama and Republican congressmen led . by House Speaker John Boehner. Today . Mr Buffett, 80, hit out by claiming the GOP strategy was like a deadly game . of chance involving passing around a six-chamber revolver loaded with a . single bullet. ‘Five times . out of six to raise the debt limit might not be dangerous, but the sixth . time could have catastrophic consequences,’ he said at a Wall Street . mogul conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. He . added that Republican were ‘trying to use the incentive now that we're . going to blow your brains out, America, in terms of your debt worthiness . over time.’ ‘You're . playing with fire when you don't need to play with fire,’ he also said, . adding: ‘We raised the debt ceiling seven times during the Bush . Administration,’ The U.S. ran into its $14.29 trillion debt ceiling on May 16, but has since used spending and accounting adjustments, as well as higher-than-expected tax receipts, to continue operating without impact on government obligations. But by August 2, the government will have to begin withholding payments - to bond holders, civil servants, pensioners or contractors - if lawmakers do not raise the ceiling. Mr Obama yesterday admitted that Democrats and Republicans are still far apart on breaking a budget deadlock and said negotiators will work through the weekend for a deal to avoid a default. Stalemate: President Barack Obama with House Speaker John Boehner (centre) and House Democrat Leader nancy Pelosi at a meeting in the White House last night which once again failed to solve the budget crisis . Hostile: The President meets with a hots of congressional Republicans . The president and congressional leaders are aiming for at least $3trillion and possibly more than $4trillion in budget savings. The meeting dwelt only with the size of a deal, not policy specifics. A Sunday meeting is to tackle the more difficult question of how those savings can be achieved. Warren Buffett has donated nearly $2billion more to charity as part of his plans to steadily donate 99 per cent of his wealth. The billionaire has so far given away $11billion but, incredibly, that still leaves him as the world's third richest man. The most recent Forbes Rich List in March put his wealth at $50billion, well ahead of Bernard Arnault, the Frenchman behind Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy and worth $41bn. His latest giveaway was via 23.31million class B shares of his insurance and investment company Berkshire Hathaway worth $1.79billion. Of these, the vast majority - around 19million - went to the Gates Foundation. Mr Buffett also donated smaller sums to four family charities, including the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for Buffett's late first wife, and foundations for their children Howard, Peter and Susan. Buffett, who in 2006 married his second wife Astrid, pictured above, has previously said that he is applying his successful investment philosophy of through research to his charity giving and has picked out Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft. He believes Gates, the world's second richest man, has developed the most cost effective ways of making a difference. Gates, a Berkshire director, created the Gates Foundation with his wife Melinda to address education, health and poverty problems. The foundation employs 927 people, spent $2.6billion last year, and has a $37.1billion endowment. Buffett's donations stand at $9.5billion so far to Gates' organisation. Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of his era. He has built his fortune with a long-term strategy of buy-and-hold, backing sure but steady businesses such as Coca-Cola and Gillette and ignoring investment fades such as the dotcom boom. He also has a knack for that cliche of buy low-sell high, piling into the stock market at the lowest ebb during the banking crisis in October 2008. ‘He has been famously quoted as saying investors should 'be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.' The U.S. deficit is expected to be $1.4 trillion this year. But . as Obama strives for a deficit reduction deal that would clear the way . for Congress to increase the $14.3trillion cap on government borrowing . by the deadline of August 2 he faces a possible rebellion on the Left of . his party. The top . Democrat in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, expressed . concerns that cuts would be made to popular entitlement programs like . Social Security and Medicare . Pelosi, who was speaker of the House until Democrats lost control last November, said she feared the poor and elderly would bear the brunt of budget-cutting. ‘Do not consider Social Security a piggy bank for giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country,’ she said. ‘We are not going to balance the budget on the backs of seniors, women and people with disabilities.’ Mr Obama and U.S. lawmakers are aiming for an agreement that will cut government spending, possibly raise taxes, and restore some semblance of order to U.S. fiscal policy. Briefing reporters after 90 minutes of talks with congressional leaders, Obama said both sides still were far apart and that staff negotiators will work through the weekend to find each side's bottom line. He said he will have another round of talks with top Democrats and Republicans on Sunday, hoping to begin ‘the hard bargaining that's necessary to get a deal done.’ ‘Everybody acknowledged that there's going to be pain involved politically on all sides but our biggest obligation is to make sure that we are doing the right thing,’ he said. Mr Boehner told Republicans before meeting Obama that they should know by the end of the week whether a big agreement is possible. ‘He said it was maybe 50-50,’ a Republican Party aide said. ‘Whether or not it happens is really dependent on whether they (Democrats) continue to insist on tax hikes.’ Normally a routine vote, the debt ceiling has been embroiled in partisan politics, with Republicans seeking to impose deep spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit, which opinion polls show is a major worry for many Americans. Mr Obama, seeking to avoid angering his liberal base ahead of his 2012 re-election bid, wants tax increases on the wealthy to lessen the pain of spending cuts. ‘I want to emphasize that nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to and the parties are still far apart on a wide range of issues,’ Obama said. Mr Boehner said comprehensive tax reform is on the table and that changes are needed in benefit programs for the poor and elderly to ensure their long-term viability. ‘We believe that comprehensive tax reform, both on the corporate side and the personal side, will make America more competitive, help create jobs in our country, and is something that is under discussion,’ Boehner said. Both sides have long sought a tax overhaul but have never agreed on how to carry it out. Democrats want to eliminate many tax breaks while Republicans generally want lower tax rates. Boehner's top deputy in the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, signalled the possibility of a compromise on Wednesday by saying Republicans could support ending some of the tax breaks that Democrats have proposed in return for tax cuts elsewhere. America’s trade deficit narrowed slightly over the past year – but the gap between imports and exports remains by far the biggest in the world, new figures revealed today. CIA research showed the U.S. continued to rank last among all nations in the world when it comes to what economists call its current account balance. The study showed that last year Americans bought $561billion more worth of goods from abroad than overseas buyers paid for American-made products.

"By . David Wilkes . PUBLISHED: . 08:31 EST, 25 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:54 EST, 25 April 2013 . We’ve had a pickled cow, that unmade bed and a shed which turned into a boat. But, doggone it, in the roll call of  barking mad contenders for the Turner Prize, this stuffed Jack Russell surely takes the biscuit. Standing on its hind legs, holding a placard in its paws declaring ‘I’M DEAD’, the expertly preserved terrier is the work of David Shrigley. Award: I'm Dead (2010) by David Shrigley, who was today nominated for the Turner Prize . Light-hearted: Mr Shrigley is known for his whimsical cartoons, such as Headless Drummer (2010) It was among the exhibits for which he was yesterday shortlisted for the prestigious £25,000 art prize. The jury said his canine creation highlights ‘the farcicalities of life’ and typifies how he is ‘a master at blending humour and cynicism with the macabre’. It added: ‘He leaves the audience with what he calls a “moral conundrum” – to laugh or not to at someone’s dead pet?’ Shrigley, 44, the doting owner of a  miniature schnauzer, did not stuff the terrier but gave a taxidermist precise instructions. Ladbrokes have now made ‘I’m Dead’ the 2/1 favourite to win. Favourite: Mr Shrigley, whose work includes Untitled (2012), pictured, is considered most likely to win . Morbid: Much of Mr Shrigley's work deals with the topic of death, including Gravestone (2008) Although better known for his cartoons and drawings, Shrigley has created other stuffed artworks, including a headless squirrel entitled Nutless. His interest in taxidermy stems from its ‘perversity’. He said: ‘These animals represent a memorial of a living thing. It’s not like a gravestone, but a naturalistic sculpture using parts of themselves.’ A gravestone is, however, featured in the Brain Activity exhibition which earned his place on the shortlist. The granite block is engraved with a gold leaf shopping list: ‘Bread, Milk, Cornflakes, Baked Beans, Tomatoes, Aspirin, Biscuits.’ The jury saw it as ‘a comment on the mundane practices of consumption and organisation that we rely on to make our way through life’. Art? One controversial nominee is Tino Seghal, centre, whose works involve setting up conversations between strangers . Installation: Wantee (2013) is an artwork by Laure Prouvost, another contender for the prize . In a varied career, Shrigley has been on the ‘Young British Artists’ scene for more than a decade. Announcing the shortlist at Tate Britain, central London, the gallery’s director Penelope Curtis said: ‘We felt he’d been overlooked for a long time because it was felt his work was just funny. ‘But it is more than that – just because it’s funny doesn’t mean it’s not good.’ Sensual: Farfromwords (2013) by Ms Prouvost features erotic shapes with an intimate soundtrack of whispers . Unusual: Another section of Ms Prouvost's Wantee, part of her portfolio nominated for the award . Also on the shortlist is Tino Sehgal, 36, a British-German artist nominated for his ‘live encounters’, such as dancers singing in a blackened room. Juror and art critic Declan Long admitted some might struggle to accept it as art. He added: ‘But it’s exciting people will be able to see something other than what they might be familiar with as art.’ Traditional: But the subjects of Complication (2013) by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye are imaginary people . Painter: Ms Yiadom-Boakye, whose work Midnight, Cadiz (2013) is pictured, is the first black woman ever to be shortlisted for the Turner Prize . Also vying for the prize are the first black woman to be shortlisted, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who paints ‘imaginary’ portraits, and installation artist Laure Prouvost. For the first time, the winner will be announced outside England.

Under current police rules they are treated as adults, meaning their parents are not automatically told if they have been detained. But two High Court judges said the policy was unlawful and breached their human rights. The legal victory was secured by Hughes Cousins-Chang, pictured today outside the High Court with Ann Thornber (right), the mother of Edward Thornber who committed suicide after a run-in with police . They ordered ministers to give the older teenagers the same rights as those aged 16 and under. The ruling follows the deaths of two . 17-year-olds, Joe Lawton and Edward Thornber, who killed themselves . after getting into trouble with police. Their parents were at court to . hear the ruling yesterday. Joe, from Stockport, Greater . Manchester, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and kept . overnight at a police station without his parents’ knowledge. Two days . later he shot himself on the family farm. Ann Thornber, from Didsbury, Greater . Manchester, said her son, Edward, had been sent a court summons ‘in . error’ rather than a final warning for possessing 50p worth of cannabis. The lacrosse star was found hanged in September 2011. The ruling marks a defeat for Home Secretary Theresa May who had opposed a change in the law . Mrs Thornber said: ‘If we had been . informed we would have been able to support Edward going through that . crisis.’ The High Court ruled that 17-year-olds should be given the same protections as younger children, and not be treated as adults in custody . In their ruling yesterday, Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice . Kenneth Parker said the current version of the code failed to . distinguish between 17-year-olds and adults. The flawed code ‘fails to treat children’s best interests as a primary consideration’, they said. The ruling came in a case brought by . sixth-form student Hughes Cousins-Chang who was arrested with a friend . by the Metropolitan Police last year when he was 17. Both were pulled off a bus and accused . of mobile phone robbery, then handcuffed, cautioned and taken to . Battersea police station, but were innocent of the crimes. He was put in a cell and strip-searched and an officer refused to tell his mother what had happened. Lord Justice Moses said: ‘The need to . include 17-year-olds within the scope of those afforded special . protection in custody seems  almost unanswerable. ‘This case demonstrates how vulnerable . a 17-year-old may be. Treated as an adult, he receives no explanation . as to how important it is to obtain the assistance of a lawyer.’ The Home Office said: ‘The Government . believes the welfare and protection of all those held in police custody, . especially young people, is extremely important. We accept the court’s . judgment and will consider the next steps to implement the changes.’","High Court rules that 17-year-olds must have the same protections as children in custody .

Armed police were involved in a tense stand-off after cornering a rampaging bullock that smashed its way into a house. Firearms officers dashed to the scene to tackle a herd of cattle that went on the run after escaping from a field in Heacham, Norfolk. During the mayhem, one of the animals crashed through the glass patio doors of a house and caused serious damage to the lounge. Steak out: Firearms officers get their weapons ready after being called to a rampaging bullock that smashed into a house in Heacham, Norfolk . Stand-off: Police make final adjustments to their weapons as they make their way towards the house where the bull had crashed through patio doors and run amok in the lounge . At one point, police with automatic weapons looked like they were preparing to shoot the intruder, but the bull eventually surrendered peacefully. Police said four bullocks were still at large last night and warned the public not to approach them. The startled homeowner, who was still clearing up, was too shocked to comment on the bizarre break-in. But neighbour Ron Clark, 63, said: 'I was in the kitchen making breakfast when I saw a cow coming up to where my fence is. 'I thought I was seeing things. It then shot across into someone's patio and into their living room. I feel lucky that it didn't cause any damage to us. 'I care for my mum, who is 93, and my brother, who's got emphysema. It frightened me because something could have happened to them. How do you stop a half-tonne cow?' Crime scene: Farmer Terry Sanderson speaks to officers outside the house as they try to recapture the anima . Suspect: This is the bull which allegedly broke into the house by smashing through the patio doors (right) After the animal had calmed down, he was coaxed onto a trailer by Heacham farmer Terry Sanderson, 65, before being driven away. Another escaped bullock was earlier shot by a farm worker after it attacked Mr Sanderson, leaving him with heavy cuts to his arm. Mr Sanderson, who farms at Heacham South Beach, said: 'I can only apologise. I don't want that to happen to anyone. I didn't want it to go in the house.' He added: 'It was the last thing in the world that I wanted. All I can say is that I am very sorry and I will sort it out with the insurance company.' In custody: The bull eventually calmed down and was coaxed onto a trailer by Heacham farmer Terry Sanderson before being driven away . Startled: The homeowner, who was still clearing up, was too shocked to comment on the break-in . The drama began just before 11am yesterday. A parish council workman had earlier tried to head off the bullock with the help of passersby. 'They all came running up the street,' said one woman who witnessed the stand-off. The man who drives the little parish council van around here tried to use it as a barrier. 'There were six big blokes with him. They got across the road, but it just ran right through them. 'It got down the end of the road by the bakery and then it skedaddled off. Police and the parish council truck have been driving around looking for it.' Council maintenance worker Robert Bradley said: 'I tried to stop the animal running down into Station Road but it scuttled across the front of my van. 'I just happened to be there and I thought I might be able to stop it charging down the road.' A Norfolk Police spokeswoman said: 'We heard that a bull had got into a property in Station Road.

Customers around the world who pre-ordered Samsung's Galaxy S4 handset so they could have one on the day it is released face delays of up to a week. UK operators were today forced to send messages to customers after Samsung blamed 'unprecedented demand' for the Android handset. US customers were also being warned of delays. The Galaxy S4 goes on sale around the world this weekend - but Samsung has admitted it has not been able to keep up with demand, leaving customers who ordered weeks ago facing delays . Customers around the world who pre-ordered Samsung's Galaxy S4 handset so they could have one on the day it is released face delays of up to a week, the firm revealed today . The firm told MailOnline it was unable to meet demand in the UK - even though customers had ordered weeks ago. 'There has been unprecedented demand for the Galaxy S4 in . the UK,' the firm said. 'Samsung is working hard to ensure that pre-orders and sales across all . channels are fulfilled as soon as possible.' Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S4 in a glitzy New York event in mid-March and planned the worldwide launch for 27 April. Many thousands are believed to have pre-ordered the phone so it would arrive on launch day may now get their handset later. The firm has undertaken a big budget 'world tour' to launch the handset. Here, a photograph is projected onto the sails of the Opera House as Samsung Electronics Australia transformed the iconic sails of the Opera House into a visual display showcasing hundreds of photographs submitted by ordinary Australians on Facebook . UK operator 3 told the BBC that Samsung was 'experiencing stock constraints' and said it regretted the frustration this would cause customers. The UK's other major operators also said they were having stock problems but were looking to prioritise customers who pre-ordered over those that walk into shops to buy the gadget. Similar delays were being reported in the US with operator Sprint delaying the opening of its online S4 store by a week to cope with demand. Experts expect the handset to be a smash hit. 'I believe the Samsung Galaxy S4 could be an important milestone for the Korean company, as it could be the first smartphone to outsell an iPhone,' said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst with IDC.'The Samsung Galaxy S4 can be a game changer for Samsung, and I believe for the first time that this device has the potential to outsell the next generation of iPhone - assuming that Apple will incrementally improve the next version of the iPhone.' The highly anticipated Samsung Galaxy S4 goes on sale in the UK tomorrow - but the firm has warned customers, even those who pre-ordered, that they may face delays because of demand . It comes as Samsung revealed strong smartphone sales have driven its income up 42 per cent to a record high despite a typically slow season for the electronics market. The world's largest smartphone maker said its first quarter net income reached 7.2 trillion won (£4.2billion) in the first three months of 2013, compared with 5 trillion won a year earlier. The figure was a surprising two per cent increase from the previous quarter. Analysts expected Samsung to report lower profit than the fourth quarter because demand typically slows. But sales of Samsung's flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S III, and the oversized handset device called the Galaxy Note remained strong and shored up profit, Samsung said. AllThingsD: 'Galaxy S 4 Is a Good, but Not a Great, Step Up' 'If . you’re a nut for lists of new features, love Samsung or crave an even . bigger display, the Galaxy S 4 may be for you. It’s a good phone, just . not a great one.' T3: 'A Real Beauty' (5/5)'It . feels good, looks smart and does more than previous smartphones have. On the other hand, just as most people only scratch the surface of the . capabilities of their home computers, settling for email, word . processing and a little light gaming, there are going to be a lot of . customers who barely dig into the features here.'The Verge: Great To Use, Unpleasant To Hold (4/5)'I . don't like holding this phone, and I can't overstate how much that . informs the experience of using it. It makes an awful first impression, . slippery and slimy and simply unpleasant in your hand.' Engadget: 'Predictable Excellence' 'If you're considering a move from an older Samsung device, the GS 4 is absolutely the handset you want.' Techcrunch: 'The S Stands For Super, Not Simple' 'It’d . be foolish to think that the Galaxy S4 isn’t a top-notch phone. But in . playing with this phone for a while, adjusting to the new features, . trying to make the most of them, and sometimes failing miserably, I keep . returning to the idea of 'Keep it simple, stupid.' It also spent less on marketing its mobile devices than it did in the previous quarter when competition heated up with rivals. Sales rose 17 per cent to 52.9 trillion won. Operating profit was up 54 per cent to 8.8 trillion won, in line with its preliminary results released earlier this month. Analysts expect Samsung to report another record-high profit during the April-June quarter as the Galaxy S4, the latest iteration of the Galaxy S smartphone, goes on sales worldwide, months before Apple introduces a new version of the iPhone. Samsung said initial orders for the Galaxy S4 were higher than expected, making it difficult to meet demand. Lee Don-Joo, head of sales and marketing at Samsung's mobile division, said sales of the S4 will be higher than its predecessor.

Furious villagers in eastern China are demanding the closure of a new stone quarry after it turned their river completely white. Residents in Aodi, Zhejiang province, say the river is now so heavily . polluted that they can't use it for drinking water for their livestock, . nor are they able to water their crops. They say that since the quarry opened a few years ago, the water regularly turns white, as the quarry bosses use the river to drain away . residue caused by blast-cleaning white stones, which are cut from pits beside the river. One local resident told reporters:  'Our animals can't drink it, it poisons the fields and we can't even . wash our clothes in it. We want this quarry closed now.' It is just one of a number of rising concerns about water in China - it is not the first time rivers have taken on different hues - and there are regularly reports of everything from pollutants to dead bodies found in waters used for cleaning and drinking. Villagers wash their clothes in the milk white water: The quarry pollution in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province has scared the local population . The river in Aodi village has been turning white regularly over several years and locals are forced to wash their clothes in the dirty water . White waters: At the upper reach of the village there is a quarry that dispels its rock washing water directly into the river, which turns it the milky colour . Last month a milky white river in Jiangsu city turned white, and included a bad smell. The reasons for the colour change is still not known - but researchers discovered that there are now no living animals reported to be found in the 10 meter wide body of water. There were reports in July of how a natural latex polluted more than a mile of the Quxi River in China’s Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province. The river also turned into a 'river of milk', which is blamed on a local latex company in the region. Resident Xiao Wu said: 'Only yesterday, I was doing my laundry in the river, and yet this morning it’s turned completely white, as though somebody poured milk into it.' This also follows a case of an orange river in Jiaxing city created by excessive iron ions in the water last March. Last month, the residents of Chongqing woke up to find the Yangtze river, which runs through the city in south-western China, coloured a bright shade of orange-red.

Bobby Hughes, now six, has been silent since he began suffering seizures. The youngster, who is also autistic, may never be able to talk and his mother Cheryl communicates with him by recognising his noises. Ms Hughes, 42, from . Droylsden, Greater Manchester, said: 'Bobby could say a few words - . mum, dad, Woody from Toy Story, no - and then he developed epilepsy. Silent: Six-year-old Bobby Hughes was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of three and hasn't spoken a single word since . Bobby, who is also autistic, may never be able to talk and his mother Cheryl communicates with him by recognising his noises . 'He had about five or six seizures and then his speech just disappeared. 'He was about three then and that's been it since. He has not said a word. It could be his autism or his seizures, we just don't know. 'Bobby and I can communicate. I recognise his noises like you do with a baby, but he can't communicate with other people at all. 'He doesn't like going out and meeting other people because he knows they can't understand him.' Both of the conditions Bobby suffers from may affect speech development. People with autism may have major problems with both speech and nonverbal communication. Speech problems include not talking at all, uttering grunts, cries, shrieks, or throaty, harsh sounds or humming or talking in a musical way. The person may also babble with word-like sounds  or use foreign-sounding 'words' or robotic-like speech. Epileptic activity in the brain may affect the development of language in children, the results of a new study indicate. Bobby's mother Cheryl (with daughter Kyna) said he could say a few words before he suffered epileptic fits, but hasn't spoken a word since . Research from the University of Gothenburg has found that epilepsy is more common in children with speech and language difficulties. There is also a condition called Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) -  an age-related epilepsy syndrome of childhood. The condition usually starts before the age of six  and affects twice as many boys as girls. Its main features are a loss of speech and language skills with seizures. The speech and language skills may improve over time. In an attempt to raise money for an iPad - in the hope it would help Bobby communicate - his late grandmother Pat launched the 'Give Bobby a Voice' appeal to collect more than 1,000 old mobile phones. They . hope to trade them in for iPads with communication software, through . the Hearts and Minds Challenge - a charity set up to improve the lives . of people with autism. Bobby's family are now trying to raise money for an iPad - in the hope it will help him communicate . His grandmother died last month before she could see her wish fulfilled but Cheryl has pledged to make it come true. Mother-of-four Ms Hughes, who volunteers for the RSPCA, wants to get iPads for Bobby and the five other children in his class at Dukinfield's Oakdale Special School, and will need 185 phones for each device. She said: 'The iPad would help him develop, help him lose some of the frustrations he has got and it would help him to be able to integrate into the outside world.' Ms Hughes needs to collect 185 mobile phones for each iPad. These phones will be given to the charity Hearts and Minds and then sent on for recycling. The money the charity is paid by the recycling company will then be used to purchase the iPads.

Adam Whelehan, 23, stabbed his former girlfriend 20 times in the neck and left her to die on the road . A man who butchered his ex-girlfriend to death after she told him she was pregnant had planned the attack for months even taking to Twitter to boast of his plans. Adam Whelehan, 23, exchanged disturbing messages with friends in the months leading up to the death of his former partner Natalie Jarvis, including a tweet saying he 'might kill', days before the brutal murder. The BT apprentice stabbed Miss Jarvis, 23, more than 20 times in the neck before  leaving her to die by the side of a country lane in Swanley, Kent in October last year. Whelehan also tormented Miss Jarvis during her final moments by breaking her mobile phone in front of her as she cried 'I am dying, please call my mum,' a court heard. Days before carrying out the brutal murder on October 3, Whelehan tweeted: ‘It’s alright to kill someone these days, isn’t it? Think I might do that.’ Whelehan, who used the multi tool given to him by BT to inflict stab wounds up to 11cm deep in Natalie’s throat, later wrote on the blogging site: 'How to do it #murderousmind.' Whelehan, described by police as ‘a cold, calculated killer’ showed no remorse during a three-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court. The court heard the pair had been a couple for four months and had continued to have a sexual relationship after the breakup. Whelehan lured McDonald’s worker Natalie to her death by promising that the pair were going to discuss their relationship and 'have sex in his car'. Whelehan, from Sidcup, Kent, who denied murder, claimed he attacked Natalie in self-defence after she lunged at him with the knife and that she had been using her false pregnancy claim to harass him in the weeks before her death. Members of Natalie’s family were reduced to tears when his friend Stephen Hughes told the jury Whelehan had boasted Natalie pleaded with him to call her mother as she lay dying on the road. Whelehan taunted Natalie, who was dressed in her pyjamas and slippers, by breaking her mobile phone in front of her as she cried ‘I’m dying, please call my mum.’ Sentencing Whelehan to a minimum of 26 . years, judge Philip Statman said: ‘This was premeditation being . nurtured over a period of many weeks. ‘You had with you in your vehicle a weapon with you with the express purpose of stabbing Natalie to death.' Callous: As his ex-girlfriend Natalie Jarvis lay bleeding in the road, begging for Whelehan to call her mother, he taunted her by breaking her phone in front of her before leaving her to die by the roadside . ‘You proceeded to inflicting 20 stab wounds to her neck and left her dead in the country lane. ‘Your . actions were callous, savage and premeditated and in giving evidence to . this court you showed no sign or indicated a flicker of emotion. Natalie’s distraught mum Adele Jarvis, 50, said: ‘Our family has been horrifically ripped apart by the loss of the most loving sister and daughter anyone could ask for. ‘Our home and lives are now a void of crushing silence without Natalie’s insatiable lust for life. ‘Our hearts have been shattered and can never be mended. Our lives will never be the same again without our sweet beautiful Natalie.’ ‘She was just so lovely, she was loveable, she was loud, she was everything to us, she was my baby. ‘I just can’t see my life without her. She loved her family and we loved her. What Whelehan has done is horrific. He has not shown an ounce of remorse.’ Jurors were shown graphic photographs of the scene showing blood splatterings stretching 100yards where Whelehan continued to attack Natalie as she tried to run away from him. Detective Inspector Gavin Moss, of Kent and Essex police, said after the verdict: ‘What immediately struck me was the distance from where we saw the first spot of blood to where Natalie ended up. ‘That was over a distance of about 150 metres, and it beggars belief what that poor girl must have gone through in that time. ‘This was a cold, calculated, brutal murder of a young female who had her whole life in front of her.’ A second man Thomas Fuller who the . prosecution claimed was the getaway driver was cleared of murder despite . admitting hiding in the boot of Whelehan’s car as Natalie was being . slaughtered.","Adam Whelehan, 23, stabbed ex Natalie Jarvis 20 times in the neck .

In its latest economic outlook report, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the UK had no room to ease up on its austerity programme. But it added that the British economy looked set to recover this year from  the recession that began at the end  of 2011. Warning: OECD Chief Economist Pier Carlo Padoan said the eurozone risks falling into a 'severe recession' Help: The European Central Bank should consider renewing the 'unconventional measures' it used last year such as buying up government bonds, the OECD said . The group kept its growth forecast unchanged at 0.5 per cent for 2012 while raising its 2013 prediction a notch to 1.9 per cent. It said: ‘The ambitious government plan to restore fiscal sustainability remains on track and appropriate despite disappointing economic growth.’ The Government has come under huge pressure to soften its austerity drive in recent weeks.

The final bill for the ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral was around a third of the £10million which opponents on the left had claimed it would be. Downing Street said confirmed that Lady Thatcher's family would be making a contribution to the overall cost - including covering the costs of the undertakers and the flowers. Personnel from the three branches of the military made up the Bearer Party which carried Lady Thatcher's coffin . The spectacular ceremony took place at St Paul's Cathedral . Lady Thatcher's family led the mourners. Pictured left to right are Carol Thatcher and partner Marco Grass, Lady Sarah Thatcher and husband Sir Mark Thatcher and his two children Michael and Amanda . The £3.6million total includes £2million for policing by 4,000 officers who would have been on duty anyway. The Cabinet Office said the estimated costs for the funeral ceremony was around £500,000. This figure includes costs incurred by St Paul’s Cathedral, the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office, the invitation printers, and staff overtime. Additional policing and security costs came to around £1.1 million. On the morning of the funeral, Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott complained about the bill. 'There is just no precedent, it’s a breach of protocol and it’s going to cost £10million,' she claimed, in what now appears to be a vast overestimate. Full details of all public money spent on Lady Thatcher’s funeral will be published before the end of July, . More than 2,300 mourners joined Lady Thatcher's daughter Carol and son Mark at the ceremony. The Queen and Prince Philip broke with tradition to attend the funeral of a former Prime Minister for the first time since Winston Churchill. All 32 members of the Cabinet attended the ceremony, along with Labour leader Ed Miliband and former Prime Ministers Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and Sir John Major . Thousands of people lined the streets of central London to watch the procession, including a horse-drawn gun carriage, pass . Lady Thatcher had requested a strong military element to her funeral, in recognition of her victory in the Falklands War . Baroness Thatcher was honoured with a sombre but spectacular funeral ceremony that paid tribute to the ‘courage and perseverance’ of Britain's greatest peacetime prime minister. Under the great dome of St Paul's Cathedral, the Queen joined dignitaries from 170 countries worldwide, friends, political foes and Lady Thatcher's closest family members to celebrate the life of the UK's first and only female premier. London's streets were also packed with mourners who broke into spontaneous applause and gave cheers and whistles of support as the coffin passed by on Wednesday last week. The emotional crowds threw white roses in the path of the gun carriage that carried Lady Thatcher through the capital, while many of the 2,300 inside St Paul's openly sobbed with Chancellor George Osborne 'overwhelmed'. The Queen broke with protocol to attend the first funeral for a former Prime Minister since Winston Churchill . Friends of the Iron Lady said the ceremony was a fitting tribute to Britain's first female Prime Minister . Outside on the streets, the predicted protests and disorder failed to materialise, with the few boos drowned out by supporters' applause. As Big Ben once again started to chime after the 11am service, the procession started its final journey. Lady Thatcher's twins Sir Mark and Carol looked moved throughout and her grandchildren Michael and Amanda were waiting at the cathedral door holding cushions bearing the insignia of the Order of the Garter and the Order of Merit, which they then placed on the Dome Altar as the coffin arrived. Margaret Thatcher's only granddaughter also paid a heartfelt tribute to the former Prime Minister with a perfectly-delivered reading. Speaking with a pronounced American accent, Amanda Thatcher, 19, read from the book of Ephesians to mourners. The teenager showed how she takes after her grandmother as she spoke with self-assurance and confidence during the service in front of the Queen, former Prime Ministers and foreign dignitaries . Amanda's reading called for the righteous to put 'on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil'.","Downing Street reveals St Paul's Cathedral ceremony cost £500,000 .

Committed to the cause: A Tibetan mother has died after setting herself on fire in protest over China's occupation of the country in the same spot in Barma where two people self-immolated last month (above) A Tibetan mother has died after setting fire to herself outside a monastery in the latest protest against China's occupation of the country. Rechok, a nomad in her 30s who has three children, died outside the Jonang Dzamthang monastery in Barma Township this afternoon. Her body is currently in the monastery and Tibetans have been gathering for her cremation, which is expected to be held this evening. Rechok spent the last few days in the mountains tending to the family’s animals before travelling into the town ready to give her life. She has two daughters aged nine and 15, and a 17-year-old son. There have now been four self-immolations in Barma in 2012 and Rechok is one of more than 30 Tibetans who have engulfed themselves in flames over the last year. In January, state security forces shot dead a young man who had been trying to prevent a friend being arrested for posting leaflets in the town claiming that self-immolations will continue until Tibet is free. Reports say the death may have been the catalyst for the fatal protests in Barma. Symbolic: The two men set fire to themselves on Sunday outside the Jokhang Temple (pictured) in Lhasa, one of Tibet's holiest buildings . Stephanie Brigden, director of . campaign group Free Tibet, said: 'Barma Township is like many other . places in Tibet - people from all walks of life are rejecting Chinese . rule and going to extraordinary lengths to make their calls for freedom . heard. 'Tibetan calls for freedom continue to spread. The international community must break their silence on Tibet.' Rechok's . death comes three days after one man was killed and another badly . injured when they set themselves alight outside a temple in the Tibetan . capital Lhasa on Sunday. It was the first time the tiny country's tightly guarded capital had been targeted. Vigorous campaign: There have been at least 34 self-immolations in the last year to highlight China's restrictions on Buddhism and to call for the return from exile of the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama (pictured) Chinese authorities identified the dead . man as 19-year-old Tobgye Tseten  and the other man as Dargye, while . American sources claim the two men were both waiters at a nearby . restaurant. There have been at least 34 such protests since March of last year to draw attention to China's restrictions on Buddhism and to call for the return from exile of the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. Most have taken place in heavily Tibetan areas of China, but only one had occurred in Tibet itself and none in the capital. Protests have become rare in remote Tibet and Lhasa in particular because of tight police security that has blanketed the area since anti-government riots erupted in Lhasa in 2008. Radio Free Asia reported on Monday that Lhasa was under heavy police and paramilitary guard following the immolations and that the situation was very tense. China's official news agency Xinhua blamed the protests on separatists and said the incidents were handled quickly and order restored. Two months ago, a Tibetan protester set himself on fire in India during a demo against a visit by the Chinese president. Jamphel Yeshi sustained burns to 98 per cent of his body when he sprinted for 50m outside the Indian Parliament building engulfed in flames. He later died. A Tibetan man self-immolates at a protest in India in March . China says Tibet has always been part of its territory, but many Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries until Chinese troops invaded in the 1950s. Beijing blames the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, for fanning anti-government sentiment and routinely purges monasteries and nunneries, where support for the Dalai Lama and Tibetan independence runs high. Angry and desperate Tibetans have taken to self-immolation in protest, as many as 34 since last March. Last November a 35-year-old nun was captured in a horrifying video after setting herself alight on a Chinese street. And in March a Tibetan man self-immolated in New Delhi, India, to protest a visit by the Chinese president. The centuries-long tradition has become a type of radical political protest and more than 500 have been reported in Western media since the 1960s. But debate rages over the controversial method of protest. Some Buddhists say suicide is violence, and therefore unacceptable, while others see self-sacrifice for a greater cause as legitimate.","Woman died outside a monastery in Barma Township .

A five-year-old autistic boy was left behind on a school bus for two hours after falling asleep during the journey. Muhamheed Umayeer Chowdhury, who attends a special needs primary school at Woolgrove School in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, was abandoned after the bus assistant failed to ensure he was escorted safely to the school with the other children. His parents were furious when they found out what had happened, as their son could have been in danger had he not been discovered in time. Five-year-old Muhamheed Umayeer Chowdhury, who has learning disabilities, was left behind on the school bus . The bizarre incident happened after the . minibus picked him up at home as usual and took him to Woolgrove School . in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, arriving at 8.30am. The driver then drove off to a friend's house unaware that the youngster, who has learning difficulties and finds it hard to communicate, was still on board asleep. It was not until 10.30am, when the driver sounded the horn of the bus to say goodbye to his friend, that Umayeer woke up and was finally discovered. Five-year-old Umayeer Chowdhury attends a special needs primary school at Woolgrove School in Hertfordshire . His mother, Shammi Chowdhury, 34, and her husband Nahid Ahmed, 35, did not know about the drama until 11am, when the school called to tell them. Mrs Chowdhury, of Stevenage, said: 'We were extremely upset that this had happened to a child with a disability who finds it hard to communicate. 'We appreciate that Umayeer has had time off school due to illness many times, but I want to make sure that this does not happen to any child again, whether disabled or not.' Umayeer's uncle, Rohim Ali, 33, who has been liaising with the school on behalf of his parents, said: 'The school apologised but we felt they did not appreciate the seriousness of the situation and blamed the council transport service. 'My belief is that if there had been the right procedures in place it would not have happened.' Mr Ali added: 'It could have been more serious - it's not what happened but what could have happened.' The assistant employed by the taxi firm has since been dismissed and the driver reprimanded. Woolgrove School headteacher Susan Selley said: 'Transport is provided by the local authority. They organise contracts with different taxi firms. 'The escorts, who are employed by the taxi firms, are responsible for ensuring all children are delivered to the school by handing them over to school staff. 'Unfortunately this child was left on the bus unbeknown to the members of staff attending to arrivals. The bus door was closed and it was assumed all children had been released.' She added: 'The child in question has been ill previously with a severe ear infection and a message has always been relayed to the teacher about his absence during the morning. So it was not entirely unusual for him not to be on the bus. 'It is school policy to contact parents mid-morning if a child does not attend and there is no telephone message from home to explain their absence. 'To prevent this from ever happening again, the new escort is being provided with a tick sheet to record who has been collected each day.' A Hertfordshire County Council spokesman said: 'The safety and well being of all children using home-to-school transport is a top priority. We therefore took this incident extremely seriously as the situation clearly was not acceptable. 'We are working with the school to ensure there is a robust procedure in place which would avoid any similar incident happening in the future.'","Five-year-old Umayeer Chowdhury was travelling to a special needs school .

A mother of three has described the heartbreaking last moment she saw her children before her husband murdered them and threw himself off a cliff. Ruth Fuller, 34, told husband Ceri, 35, she was leaving him because of a ‘schoolgirl crush’ on a university lecturer. She asked him to give her space while she packed by taking their children Sam, 12, Rebecca, eight, and Charlotte, seven, on a drive away from their home in Milkwall in Gloucestershire, an inquest heard. Ceri Fuller, pictured on his wedding day to Ruth, was found dead at the foot of the 60ft cliff and his children (l - r) Rebecca, eight, Charlotte, seven and Sam, 12, suffered stab wounds to their necks, an inquest heard . She heard a car door slam but it was . only much later, when she saw her son’s treasured mobile was left . behind, that she knew ‘something horrible had happened’, she said. In fact, her husband had taken the . children to a secluded beauty spot in Shropshire, where he stabbed them . to death with a 6.5inch hunting knife before killing himself. Fuller's fingerprint was found on a hunting knife near the children's bodies . ‘I was up early on the Thursday and I . was telling him I was going soon,’ Mrs Fuller said. ‘I was trying to . pack a bag. I said, “take the kids for a drive and I will tidy up the . house”. ‘That was the last time I saw Ceri. All I remember is hearing the car door shut.’ Unaware of the impending tragedy, Mrs . Fuller left the house and continued to send ‘flirty’ texts to tutor Mark . Lindley-Highfield, 38. She told the hearing the first sign something . was wrong came when the children’s school called. ‘School rang to ask . where the kids were and I said they were sick. They had been sick . recently.’ Mrs Fuller became increasingly worried about where her husband had gone. ‘By this point I was with mum and I was panicking. I realised I didn’t know if the children were at home or at school. ‘I had walked around and looked in their duvets before I left and not seen them. ‘I went home with my dad and there was Ceri’s phone and there was also Sam’s phone, which was unusual,’ she said. ‘At this point, I knew something horrible had happened but I couldn’t admit [it] to myself or mum or dad.’ Distraught, Mrs Fuller attempted to . kill herself with a kitchen knife, but was held back by her father, the . inquest heard. She said: ‘My head was completely broken. I didn’t know . where the children were and I didn’t know what that meant. ‘I just panicked and ended up having a mental breakdown.

Jose Matada, from Mozambique, fell to his death from the undercarriage of an aeroplane ten miles from Heathrow . A man who died after plummeting from the undercarriage of a plane flying over London had a 'desire to travel to Europe for a better life', an inquest heard today. Jose Matada, 26, from Mozambique, suffered massive injuries after falling from the Heathrow-bound flight from Angola on September 9 last year. His body was found on the pavement of Portman Avenue, Mortlake, in south-west London. West London Coroner’s Court heard the stowaway may have been dead before he hit the ground either because he had been crushed by the retracting landing gear shortly after the plane took off, or because of the extreme cold at high altitude. Detectives analysed a sim card found in his jeans and contacted the phone numbers that were stored on it in a bid to identify him. Detective sergeant Jeremy Allsup, from the Metropolitan Police, told the inquest that officers contacted a woman in Switzerland who had exchanged text messages with Mr Matada. The woman, referred to during the hearing as Ms Hunt, told police Mr Matada had worked for her family as a housekeeper and gardener in South Africa and had spoken to her about travelling to Europe. She told officers that although she had done nothing to facilitate his trip, she knew Mr Matada had 'desired to travel to Europe for a better life', Mr Allsup said. Police had originally thought Mr Matada, also known as Youssouf Matada, was Angolan because of currency found in his pockets. A post-mortem gave the cause of death as multiple injuries. Coroner Dr Sean Cummings recorded a verdict of accidental death. Detectives initially believed Mr Matada was from Angola as he had the country's currency on him when he was found in the street in Mortlake, pictured . Mr Matada turned 26 on the day he fell, the inquest heard. He was wearing light clothing and had . a tattoo on his left arm with the letters 'Z' and 'G' clearly visible, . the hearing was told. Residents in Portman Avenue described . hearing a 'thud' shortly before the British Airways flight was due to . land at 7.45am, DS Allsup said. 'The spread of body matter suggested the body had fallen from some height,' he added. The incident was initially treated as a possible violent assault due to the nature of the man’s injuries, the hearing was told. Aviation experts say Mr Matada was probably dead before he hit the ground either from cold or from being crushed by the wheels after take off (file picture) Forensic pathologist Dr Robert . Chapman told the inquest that Mr Matada had suffered 'very severe . injuries', particularly to his head. There was damage to his skull and . brain, fractures to his spine, pelvis, left arm and right shin and . various other marks and injuries, he added. Dr Chapman said the extremely low . temperatures of between minus 50C (minus 58F) and minus 60C (minus 76F), . the lack of oxygen at high altitude and the dangers of the plane’s . retracting landing gear may have caused Mr Matada’s death before his . body hit the ground. 'The man was either very close to the point of death or dead before the time he struck the ground,' he said. Dr Chapman said he had only dealt with two previous incidents of stowaways falling from planes in his career. Returning his verdict, Dr Cummings said: 'My conclusion is that Jose Matada died as a result of an accident.'","Jose Matada, 26, found on pavement in Mortlake, London, in September .

"By . Steve Doughty . UPDATED: . 18:53 EST, 16 November 2011 . MPs are to vote next week on moves to bring in a ban on smoking in cars. If passed, a Private Member’s Bill put forward by Labour MP Alex  Cunningham will outlaw smoking in private vehicles carrying children. It could be the first step on a total ban on smoking in cars. Last safe haven for the smoker? The BMA campaign is based on the premise that cigarette toxin levels are 23 times higher in a closed car . The British Medical Association wants such an outright ban because smoke in a closed car is much thicker in the air than in a smoky bar – and smoking in pubs was made illegal four years ago. BMA spokesman Dr Vivienne Nathanson said: ‘Doctors see the individual  cases of ill-health and premature death caused by smoking and second-hand smoke. ‘For this reason, doctors are committed to reducing the harm caused by tobacco.’ The pressure for a new smoking law has won support from health pressure groups but provoked anger among Conservative backbenchers who claim it would be ‘a triumph for the nanny state’. The Prime Minister has made clear his own reluctance over such a ban. Reluctant: While David Cameron was behind the 2007 smoking ban, he is 'nervous' about moving the policy inside people's vehicles . Scathing: Tory MPs Philip Davies (left) and Julian Brazier (right) criticised the campaign for a ban, branding it 'ridiculous' Very few Private Member’s Bills become law, but they stimulate debate on an issue, and this can lead to more powerful legislative efforts. The BMA campaign is based on the premise that toxin levels produced by  smoking in a closed vehicle are 23 times higher than those found in a smoky bar, and that children and the elderly are  particularly at risk. The response from ministers yesterday was cautious. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We do not believe legislation is the most effective way to encourage people to change their behaviour.’ Instead Whitehall will launch a publicity campaign next spring warning of the dangers of smoking in cars and at home. David Cameron told MPs that while he supported the ban on smoking in public places which has been in force since 2007, ‘I am much more nervous about going into what people do inside a vehicle’. Backbench Tory MPs were scathing about the campaign for a ban. Philip Davies, MP for Shipley, said: ‘It is a ridiculous idea, and typical of the health zealots of the BMA. ‘Why don’t they say what they really want, which is for smoking to be banned altogether? They don’t have the courage to say that, so they try to do it in small steps.’ Mr Davies added: ‘Banning smoking in cars would be a triumph for the nanny state. What people do in their own cars is their own business and the BMA should keep their noses out.’ Julian Brazier, MP for Canterbury, said: ‘The ban the BMA recommend would be both an intrusion into privacy and would waste a great deal of police time. ‘It would be one more example of the diversion of police away from their  essential business of stopping real crime into a politically correct dead end.’ Mr Brazier added: ‘Where you smoke or not in your private car must be a personal choice.’ Civil liberties pressure groups were also critical. Sean Gabb of the Libertarian Alliance claimed that warnings of the risks of passive smoking were based on ‘junk statistics’. 'Junk statistics': Civil liberties groups have also been critical of the proposals . He added: ‘The demand for a smoking ban in cars is an instance of the “saving the kiddies” argument. ‘This proceeds by hiding the agenda of control behind a cloud of hot air about the need to protect children.’ However Mr Cunningham’s bill – to be presented in the Commons on Wednesday – is attracting support from MPs who believe publicity campaigns are not enough to curb smoking. Liberal Democrat Stephen Williams, who chairs the all-party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health, said: ‘While welcoming the Department of Health’s commitment to launch a  marketing campaign to encourage  people to make their homes and cars smoke-free, having listened to the experts, I believe this will not be sufficient. ‘The killer fact for me was that just one cigarette smoked in a car during a  30-minute journey with the windows closed leads to levels of second-hand smoke about seven times that of the smoky bars that existed in this country before 2007. ‘This is clearly intolerable and it is time to turn the debate to how best to protect children from second-hand smoke.’","BMA says smoke is 23 times more toxic in a closed car .

Inquest: Lucy Boughton died aged 20 in a car crash on the A21 in Kent in October 2011, on a road which the Highways Agency had neglected . A former grammar school girl died on a notoriously treacherous bend with such a bad road surface it sent her car skidding into some trees, an inquest heard today. A coroner today blasted the Highways Agency after hearing 'systemic failures' led to the death of 20-year-old Lucy Boughton. The former Weald of Kent Grammar School pupil was at the wheel when her . car crashed on October 24, 2011, skidding on the dual carriageway between Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge in Kent. Coroner Roger Hatch ruled said the reason the student's car left the A21 in Kent was the failure of the Highways Agency to maintain the road, despite evidence of a worsening safety record. Mr Hatch heard how the Highways Agency had been repeatedly warned the road was unsafe. But the inquest heard the authority failed to take action in the three years before Lucy’s death. Her family, including dad Richard, mum Charlotte, sisters Amy, 22, Katie, 18, and brother Jack, 16, were at the inquest to hear the verdict that Lucy was not at fault for the accident. Amy was a passenger in the car, a mint green Volkswagen Polo, driven by Lucy at the time of the accident. Reliving the tragic day, she explained the pair were driving home to Sevenoaks from dinner in Tunbridge Wells in heavy rain. She said: 'Halfway round the bend I felt the back of the car slip out and we started going towards the other side of the road. 'I called out to Lucy and she replied in panic ""Oh my God"". She tried to correct the car but it swung towards the trees. 'The next thing I recall is coming to and seeing headlights lighting up the tree trunks.' Crash: The former grammar school girl died on the A21 (pictured) - on a bend in the road the Highways Agency appear to have not maintained properly . Upset: The coroner blasted the Highways Agency for not spending money on resurfacing the road despite warnings it was dangerous . Tesco delivery van driver Matthew Elston, who was travelling in the opposite direction, described how the car swung left and veered off the road. 'It hit the trees and flipped over before landing on its wheels again,' he said. Battle: Lucy's family revealed she had suffered from an eating disorder but had beaten it . Mr Elston and other witnesses described hearing other vehicles skidding on the bend after the accident. Simon Phipps, an estate agent from Tonbridge, sent two e-mails to Kent County Council warning the road was unsafe before the tragedy. In November 2010, Mr Phipps wrote: 'Please put down a skid-resistant surface before someone gets killed.' Alexandra Luck, an independent consultant employed by Kent Police to investigate the accident, had similar concerns. 'I believe that there have been significant systemic failures to maintain the highway, despite a worsening safety record.' Elio Rapa, a manager for the engineering consultants Balfour Beatty Mott MacDonald, explained that four investigations were carried out between May 2009 and 2011, but the route did not score high enough to receive funding. He said: 'After the fatality we couldn’t wait for another to happen and the HA (Highways Agency) authorised funding for high-friction surfacing.' Coroner Mr Hatch said: 'So it’s a question of money - the bend wasn’t a national priority but, when an accident like this happens, funds can suddenly be found?' A Highways Agency spokesperson said today: 'Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Lucy Boughton following the tragic incident on the A21. We will give very careful consideration to any written recommendations from the Coroner.' Meanwhile, Lucy’s family revealed how she had fought anorexia when she was a teenager and beat it. On a website set up in memory of her, called Tributes to Lucy, the family said: 'When Lucy was a teenager this was one of the hardest times of her life. She developed an eating disorder called anorexia, and battled this until she was about 19. 'But she came through it and grew into the person she wanted to be and that we all knew she could be. 'All in all, she was an amazing person, she had been through so much, and come (sic) out a better person for it. 'Lucy - We’ll love you forever, we’ll remember you always, and you will live on in us for eternity. Sleep well our beautiful butterfly.'","Lucy Boughton, 20, died after her car slipped off the A21 in Kent .

He said: 'It's evocative and moving. A beautiful scene that makes you want to dive into the image. I find it surprisingly moving and breathtakingly beautiful. Canoeing is accessible to everyone. It requires no expertise. And, just like the National Parks, it's for everyone.' Kathryn Cook, UK Director of the UK Association of National Park Authorities, who helped pick the final shortlist, added: 'We were really taken with the quality of this year's entries and there were some lively discussions among the judges about who should go through. 'Each of the photos so wonderfully represented what is special about the UK's National Parks - that they are free and open to all of us.' This image by James Grant of a walker standing on the edges of Kinder Scout in the Peak District - Derbyshire's highest point - was one of the finalists in the competition . Another finalist was this photograph, taken by Sarah Caird, showing her daughter enjoying her first paddle in Loch an Eilein, in the Cairngorms . Chris Mole took this image - one of the finalists - of walkers in silhouette on the cliffs near the lighthouse at Beachy Head, in the South Downs . Andy Curtis' photograph of a walker on Bamford Edge in the Peak District - overlooking Ladybower Reservoir - was a finalist in the competition . Another of the finalists in the competition was Steve Glover's picture of a man climbing Kilnsey Crag - a limescale cliff in the Yorkshire Dales . Amateur photographer Fraser is originally from Tasmania in Australia, but moved to Norwich in 2007 to be with his girlfriend who he met whilst she was on holiday in Tasmania. He said: 'At the time I didn't even know Norfolk existed. It's much different to Tasmania where there is barely a flat piece of ground anywhere. However I learned to love the landscape especially after we bought an old hand-made canoe. This panoramic image called Miners' Path up Snowdon - taken in Snowdonia by Mark Wheeler - was another finalist in the compeition . 'About this time I took up photography and we started exploring the Broads, putting a tent and some warm clothes in our leaky old canoe and setting off from Norwich, headed down river for the weekend.' The competition, entitled Actively Yours, promotes this year's National Parks Week, from July 29 to August 4, where people are encouraged to get out and about, be it walking, horse riding, canoeing, rock climbing or cycling in one of the UK's 15 national parks.

Britain should be ready to accept more immigrants from the rest of Europe because it has a lower level of unemployment, Brussels said today. The European Commission claimed there was no evidence that migrant workers take jobs from British nationals, and vowed to make it easier for jobseekers to move around the continent. The move was held up as proof that the government has ‘lost control of our borders’. The European Commission said it wanted to make it easier for workers to move around the continent, arguing there is no evidence that migrants take jobs from locals . The Commission said ‘labour mobility’ benefits both the workers and the countries they arrive in. It suggested migrants help to ‘fill vacancies that would otherwise not be filled’ European Commissioner László Andor wants Britain to be more open to migrant workers . In a statement the Commission added: ‘There is no evidence that migrant workers take jobs away from host country workers.’ Employment and Social Affairs Commissioner Laszlo Andor said: ‘The free movement of workers is a key principle of the EU’s single market. ‘With much higher levels of unemployment in some member states than others at the moment, it is all the more important to make it easier for those who want to work in another EU country to be able to do so.’ The unemployment rate in Spain and Greece stands at 27 per cent, Portugal 15 per cent and France 10 per cent. Latest figures show in the Britain the rate is 7.8 per cent. The Commission claims employers are often ignorant of migrant workers’ rights under EU law, including non-discrimination and equal pay. It wants to make it easier for firms to hire foreign staff. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the policy would be funny if it were not so sinister . The new proposal, if backed by MEPs and EU ministers, will beef up current rules by forcing national authorities to set up dedicated contact points for migrant workers’ information and advice about their rights. UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The timing of this is of course not an accident and this statement has been put out specifically to stick two fingers up at Mr Cameron. ‘It shows clearly that he and this government are entirely impatient despite all their protestations. Membership of the European Union means you have lost control of your borders, ‘It is that simple. ‘To rub salt into the wounds of course they expect the British taxpayer to pick up the tab for training foreign nationals on how to access our welfare system. It would be laughable if it were not so sinister.’ In the UK 4.8 per cent of the labour force is made up of nationals from other member states - 1.4m migrant workers. Only 1.1 per cent of working age Britons - 330,000 workers - are currently employed in other EU countries.","European Commission says there is no evidence migrant workers take jobs from locals .

Francois Hollande’s former partner has demanded ‘respect’ from his current girlfriend in an increasingly bitter war of words. The French media have likened the spat between Segolene Royal, the mother of the president’s four children, and first lady Valerie Trierweiler, who is nicknamed The Rottweiler, to ‘Dallas at the Elysee Palace’. Miss Royal, a former presidential candidate who lived with Mr Hollande for 30 years before he left her for Miss Trierweiler, is standing for parliament in the western town of La Rochelle against Left-winger Olivier Falorni.

The comment was swiftly condemned as ‘like Dallas at the Elysee Palace’ by French news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur. Telling off: Following Valerie Trierweiler's (pictured right) Twitter comments, Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said 'everyone should know their place' The L’Alsace newspaper wrote: 'It’s a slap in the face.

The Journal de la Haute Marne called the Tweet: 'A venomous personal . spat between two women being carried out within the cauldron of . politics.'

A Russian motorist has been branded 'the world's worst father' after he forced his eight-year-old daughter to drive his car at more than 60mph on an icy road. Dmitry Mihulchik, 28, filmed his daughter Karina taking the family Audi for a spin and uploaded the shocking footage online. He urged the schoolgirl to keep speeding up, even though the car appeared to be drifted into the middle of the road. Scroll down to watch the shocking video . Terror: Eight-year-old Karina driving her father's Audi on a rural snow-covered road . Investigation: The girl's parents Dmitry Mihulchik, left, and Lena, right, are the subjects of a police probe . While most Russian web users were highly critical of Mihulchik's behaviour, others praised him and said that they too had been taught to drive from a very early age. The video shows the father sitting next to Karina, telling her: 'Come on, speed up. Yeah, go go. 'Is it at least 70kph? Don't look at the speedometer, look at the road.' Then he hands the camera to his 29-year-old wife, who is sitting in the back, saying: 'There you go Lena, have a look.' Danger: Karina looks nervous as her father tells her to carry on accelerating despite her high speed . Quick: The eight-year-old ended up going as fast as 100kph, which is more than 60mph . As the speed increases, with the father occasionally clutching the wheel to control the car, he tells his daughter: 'Push it to at least 100kph.' As she tops 90kph (56mph), he tells her insistently: 'Come on, you stop looking at the speed, just press the gas, don't be scared.' The couple from St Petersburg are facing a police probe over the hair raising drive. 'An investigation has been opened,' said a spokesman. Neither the eight-year-old driver nor her parents were wearing seatbelts during the drive lasting more than six minutes. Karina appears nervous at times but finally exclaims after reaching 100kph: 'A child who is only eight years old and already she can drive a car.' Reckless: Neither Karina not her parents appeared to be wearing a seatbelt during the journey . Help: Mihulchik sometimes put his hand on the wheel to stop the car weaving across the road . Comments from Russians who watched the video included 'brainless', 'complete idiots' and, 'The poor child is not guilty, it is all her parents' fault.' One site branded Dmitry 'the worst father in the world for this grotesque child abuse'. Another said: 'How can any parents do this? They should be deprived of their rights to raise the child.' But others praised the parents for allowing their child to drive. Success: Karina appeared unharmed after driving the car and boasted of her motoring prowess . 'You don't need a lot of experience to hold the steering wheel and press the gas, so there is nothing particularly wrong with that,' Vladimir Revyakin wrote. 'I also learned to drive at about the same age on a deserted highway, though my parents didn't allow me to go more than 80 kph.' Someone else posted: 'I'm glad that there are still people in this country who teach children how to make the right choice. My dad taught me to drive a car when I was seven years old.' It is unclear what punishment the parents might face, but some have suggested it could be a fine as low as 2,500 roubles (£55) for allowing their daughter to drive without a licence.","Dmitry Mihulchik blasted by web users after posting shocking video online .

So he was stunned to arrive at a Women’s Institute meeting and find the members wearing eye patches, wigs and fake wooden legs while brandishing plastic cutlasses. They had been told their 75-year-old guest would be talking to them about piracy – so several turned up in fancy dress. Blunder: Members of the Parkham Women's Institute with pirates' kidnapping victim Colin Darch, centre . The horrified women then discovered he . was there to discuss how he was savagely beaten and held at gunpoint . during a 47-day ordeal in the Indian Ocean in 2008. But Captain Darch reacted with good humour to the blunder and carried on his talk as planned. ‘They seemed to be a little . embarrassed but it didn’t offend me in the slightest,’ he said yesterday . at home in Appledore, Devon. ‘It’s been five years now and . sometimes I have to remind myself just how terrifying and frightening it . was. In any event, the ladies didn’t look the slightest bit like Somali . pirates – more like the Pirates of Penzance. Speaker: Mr Darch, 75, was held hostage by armed rebels for 47 days in 2008 . ‘In the end they asked me to select the best costume. I gave them all marks out of ten. It was just a bit of fun.’ Captain Darch was held hostage by 20 . gun-toting pirates after they leapt aboard his Danish ship, the Svitzer . Korsakov, in the Gulf  of Aden. Four Russian crew members were ordered . to lie down on the deck but the captain and his Irish engineer, Fred . Parle, 68, were needed to sail the 115ft vessel. His haunting account describes how he was struck over the head and warned he would be shot if his crew disobeyed their captors. He and his fellow hostages were accompanied everywhere they went, even to the lavatory. Six weeks later a rumoured £350,000 ransom was agreed and the crew were freed. Captain Darch returned to Devon where . he was reunited with wife Barbara, 70, and began writing about the . terrifying episode for a book, Capture By Somali Pirates And Other . Events At Sea.

A Chinese gangster who said being forced to leave his Christian retreat centre would 'devastate' him and a convicted Somalian sex attacker cannot be kicked out of Britain because of human rights laws. Tsai Wang Chen, 39, has settled in a church community where he grows vegetables and looks after hens after being released from prison and argued it would breach his right to a private life if he was sent back. And asylum seeker Ahmed Hersi, 26, cannot be deported because of civil war in his native Somalia - despite carrying out a sex attack after human rights rules stopped his deportation. Staying here: Chinese gangster Tsai Wang Chen, 39, left, cannot be deported because he has settled in a Christian community while war in Ahmed Hersi's native Somalia means he can't be put on a flight back . Chen won the right to stay in the UK after the Home Office blew thousands of pounds in an attempt to have him sent back to China. The convicted criminal lives for free in Ministeracres, near Consett, in Northumberland and spends his looking after the hens and helping with the cleaning. Chen was a 'snakehead' gangster - a group who are paid to smuggle people into the country - who was convicted of kidnap, false imprisonment and blackmail, the Daily Mirror reported. The gangster and his three accomplices seized a man and demanded a ransom of £29,000 before they later released him. He was locked up for six years by Judge Paul Clark at Oxford Crown Court in 1997 for the violent crime. But after his release he has created a new life for himself at the sheltered Christian retreat centre. Ministeracres is an 18th century Grade II mansion house set in idyllic countryside and is used by Christians as a place to escape and 'find healing and wholeness in their relationship with God, themselves, others and creation'. Retreat centre: Chen has forged a new life for himself with the community at Minsteracres (pictured) Home Office officials negotiated with the Chinese to send Chen back but they were 'extremely reluctant' to have him. A note in their newsletter recently confirmed that Chen was free to stay in Britain. It . said: 'During the past number of years Tsai Wang has been part of the . community whilst attempts were made to persuade the Home Office to allow . him to stay in Britain. 'Recently these efforts were rewarded and Tsai received the good news that he has permission to stay here and make a new start.' Immigration Judge Peter Lane ruled that kicking Chen out of the country would be in breach of Article 8 of human rights laws and the right to respect for private and family life. 'He has been out of detention for seven and a half years, forging the unusual but strong private life,' Judge Lane said, the Daily Mirror reported. Chen told the hearing 'Since I came to Minsteracres, I have contributed to the life and work of the community. Ministeracres has given me a new life.' The Chinese man won his battle in February and is staying at the retreat centre. However, he still has to report to police regularly. New life: St Margaret's Church near the Ministeracres Centre in Northumberland where Chen has lived since his release from prison . Chen is the latest in a long line of convicted criminals to successfully use Human Rights laws to argue that deportation would breach their right to a private and family life. Somalian sex offender Hersi has also been allowed to stay because of the risk to his safety if he is returned to his war torn homeland. Still here: Ahmed Hersi who was told in 2007 that he would be deported to Somalia . The 26-year-old was placed on the sex offenders register for an assault . committed after the European Court of Human Rights stopped his . deportation from Britain . It . ruled the asylum seeker, who wears a Home Office tag on his ankle, . cannot be sent back to his native country while civil war rages. He has asked for a 'second chance' - and said he shouldn't be deported for making a mistake. He . was jailed for three years in 2007 after being found guilty of a street . robbery but after a six-year legal battle he is still here. He . has dubbed his treatment as inhuman and maintains our government will . deliver a death sentence by deporting him to lawless Mogadishu. Hersi, . from Small Heath, Birmingham said: 'I have been here since I was eight, . I can hardly speak Somalian. I don't remember my motherland. They'll . see me as ""this rich kid from England"". 'I . have been placed in a box by the immigration department, a box that is . on fire. I am being treated like a pet dog. If you tell a pet dog to . stay in that room, it will stay in that room.' Yet Hersi, who has a 20 strong family in Birmingham, has hardly been a model citizen. As . a juvenile, he was twice placed on probation for shoplifting before . receiving three years for street robbery. 'It was a stupid, irrational . thing to do,' he said. 'It does not shine a good light on me, but I was high on cannabis.' He was informed he was being kicked out of the UK while in prison - and has lost two appeals against the decision. Hersi was told he must leave in 2007 but has appealed. He was convicted of criminal damage in 2009 and jailed for 12 weeks in 2011 for a sexual assault. But Hersi believes he is the victim. 'I am not trying to deny I have a criminal past,' he said. 'My . argument is, had I been given some form of access to do something . productive when I was released things would have been different. I can't . even do voluntary work. 'There . were two co-defendants in the robbery case and they now have jobs, cars . and homes. I was not given that opportunity. I am 26 and my life is on . hold. Yes, I made a mistake. Why was I not given the opportunity to . repent? 'There are rapists and paedophiles being released and they are re-offending. How can I be deported for one mistake?' Ahmed Hersi boasted about how he drunkenly begged a teenage girl on a bus for sex. Hersi, who has never worked, said: 'All I did was ask a girl if she wanted sex. 'I was paralytic after a house party and was on the bus sitting near a really fit girl. 'She was 17, maybe 18. I touched her on the shoulder and said something like ""hey why don't you come round to my house for sexual intercourse?"" 'It was harmless fun. I shouldn't have done it and I pleaded guilty to sexual assault. 'What man doesn't want to have sex with a pretty girl when they're drunk?' In 2011 Hersi was jailed for his part in a vicious street robbery. He added: 'I was on a bus with friends when we got abused by a man for no reason. The argument escalated into a fight which ended up being a robbery. 'I had no intention of taking part in the robbery but it just happened.I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.' Hersi was born in Somalia but left when he was four years old and eventually arrived in Britain when he was aged eight. He said: 'I consider myself British, I deserve to be allowed to stay here. 'My life was over after I came out of the young offender's institute because I wanted to be a youth worker but my conviction put me in breach of my immigration agreement.' The Home Office are believed to still be making efforts to have him sent back to his homeland. A . Home Office spokesperson said: 'We take all necessary steps to deport . people who break our laws and in 2012 we removed 4,500 foreign national . offenders. 'However, . deportation can be delayed when offenders seek to frustrate the process . or challenge us on human rights grounds.

She's OK with it now, but it's been a couple of years,' she told Advocate. 'My dad at first was very, very, very furious. I think it took him a good three weeks to finally accept the fact that I was just going to be who I was and be proud of it.' She started dating her girlfriend, Tamyra Bell, in 2010 and took her to her high school prom. Bell, 20, has been involved in the pageants and helps Valencia pick outfits for the shows. Confident: She came out in the ninth grade and said that she received great support from family and school . Strong: She is pictured with her girlfriend of almost three years, 20-year-old Tamyra Bell . Valencia explained that teachers and the community have shown them real support. 'In Spartanburg, I think we’re one of the most well-known couples,' she told Advocate. 'Everybody loves us, we don't know why.' Yet she knows she still has a long way to go: They reside in a state which bans same-sex marriage and does not give employment, housing or hate-crime protections for LGBT people. Valencia is not only fighting for equality for racial minorities and LBGT teens, but also for people with special needs, as she coaches Special Olympics gymnasts.

She currently takes classes at Spartanburg Community College and eventually wants to earn a business degree at the University of South Carolina before setting up a gymnastics school.

'I think it takes a lot of courage for any young person to live openly and authentically. We are extremely proud of Analouisa,' he told CNN. 'She can be a role model for LGBT youth.' But she is aware that just because she is a lesbian, it is not that alone which should win her the title.

"By . Paul Revoir . UPDATED: . 06:21 EST, 23 December 2011 . A song by an Australian comedian which refers to Jesus Christ as a ‘zombie’ and a ‘telepathic vampire’ has been pulled from Jonathan Ross’s Christmas show for fear of upsetting Christians. Tim Minchin penned the song for his appearance on the chat show, which airs tonight, with lyrics which compare the Virgin Mary to a ’lizard’ and say that Jesus ‘does what Derren Brown does’. But a furious Minchin claims the song, which draws parallels between Woody Allen and Jesus, had been approved by the programme’s producers and lawyers before ITV’s director of television Peter Fincham ruled it should be cut. Scroll down for video . Axed: Tim Minchin performing the song on the show, which was recorded on Tuesday . Minchin - who is behind West End . hit Matilda - has written an angry blog suggesting Mr Fincham was . nervous about a backlash. Mr . Fincham lost his job at the BBC over a programme trailer which . misleadingly suggested the Queen had stormed out of a photo shoot. The . comedian complained he had taken on the commission at a particularly . busy period because of the exposure of such a high-profile show, . spending three ‘stressed’ days on it. He said the humorous song was pulled when Mr Fincham watched the show. However ITV said it had axed the song because ‘editorially’ it had not worked with the rest of the show. In the performance Minchin sang to the studio audience, and . guests including Tom Cruise and cast members from Downton Abbey: ‘Jesus . lives forever, which is pretty odd, but not as odd as his fetish for . drinking blood.’ He compares the resurrection with the late 70s horror film Dawn of the Dead. He sings: ‘Try that these days you’d be in trouble, geeks would try and smack you with a shovel.’ He lampoons the idea of the virgin birth, singing: ‘Jesus’s mother gave birth to him without having sex with a dude, no she would never be that rude, never even been nude with a dude.’ Disappointed: The comedian claims ITV bosses are pandering to Christians who are 'afraid of anything that challenges their beliefs' The . performer goes on: ‘Breeding without the opposite gender is, commonly . known as parthenogenesis, other animals that don’t need males include a . lot of lizards and various snails.’ In his blog Minchin - who had to rush from filming straight to his own show at London’s Hammersmith Apollo after last week’s recording - said: ‘Peter Fincham demanded that I be cut from the show.’ The song was due to be aired on the show tonight . Ross himself, who famously came under fire for his part in the Andrew Sachs phone message scandal, also expressed disappointment the song had been dropped. He wrote on Twitter: ‘Really gutted that the brilliant Tim Minchin song has been cut from my show. Decision was out of my hands.’ However an ITV source said the decision was less about religious sensitivity and more that ‘tonally, it wasn’t right for the show’. Ross had introduced the song by saying Minchin was here to ‘given an alternative view of Christmas’. During the song Minchin had described Jesus as ‘short, Jewish and quite political’. In his blog Minchin said Tom Cruise had thought the song was ‘great’ and claimed the producers had edited the show and were happy with it. The comedian uploaded a recording of the song as performed on Ross's show on YouTube . But he claims ‘someone got nervous’ and sent the tape to ITV’s Mr Fincham. He claimed the ITV boss was scared of the Right-wing press and of the ‘small minority of Brits who believe they have a right to go through life protected from anything that challenges them in any way.’ An ITV spokesman said: ‘We often make changes to programmes before transmission and on this occasion we felt that the song didn’t quite work editorially.’ Minchin has now posted the pulled footage on his own website to allow fans to hear the track, saying: ‘I hope you enjoy my silly, harmless, accurate song of praise, Woody Allen Jesus.’ The Ross programme is to be screened tonight on ITV1 at 9pm. Almost seven years ago BBC executives received threats after the broadcast of Jerry Springer: The Opera, which upset some right-wing Christian groups. The broadcast was said to have generated more than 50,000 complaints.","Tim Minchin lashes out as his performance is axed from show .

With his floppy fringe and sweet, angelic face it is plain to see why his teachers described him as looking like Justin Bieber's cute younger brother. But while most children his age spend their days laughing with friends with nothing more serious to consider than their latest homework assignment, Paul Henry Gingerich is enduring an entirely different reality. In 2010, at the age of 12, Paul, from Enchanted Hills, Indiana,  was sentenced to 25-years in prison for his part in shooting dead a friend's stepfather. Scroll down for video . Childhood behind bars: Paul Henry Gingerich, now 15, sits in his cramped cell in juvenile detention . Killer:  Gingerich was sentenced to 25 years in . prison for helping kill a friend's stepfather after being tried in an . adult court at the age of 12 . While his crime was undoubtedly terrible, what is perhaps equally shocking is that despite his age, Paul was tried as an adult and is now not due to be released until he is 37. In Indiana, under extreme circumstances, children as young as 10 can be tried and sentenced in adult courts. However it is rare and Paul remains one of the youngest ever to be tried in this fashion. Paul's life was turned upside down on a fateful day in April, 2010, when he went from an ordinary kid, who had never been in trouble for anything more serious than talking in class and not finishing his homework, to a killer. Prison life: Paul Gingerich, now 15, is due to spend three more years in juvenile detention before being moved to Indiana's notoriously tough adult prison system . Killers: Gingerich (left) was sentenced to 25 . years for conspiracy to commit murder. With Colt Lundy (right), then 15, . he shot dead Lundy's stepfather who they feared would not let them run . away to Arizona . Paul, an older boy called Colt Lundy and another 12-year-old called Chase Williams, had planned to run away together. But . the then 15-year-old Lundy had told the other boys that his stepfather Phil . Danner, would never allow it, so they would have to kill him first. Lundy . handed Paul a loaded gun and the pair crept through a window into . Danner's house where they sat in armchairs waiting for him to walk into . the room. Victim: Paul Gingerich was found guilty of conspiring to fatally shoot 49-year-old Phillip Danner (pictured) The other younger boy Chase Williams had refused to go in and had remained outside the house. In his original police confession Paul . described what happened next: 'Phil turned the corner and then he . (Colt) shot him. I freaked out and closed my eyes and turned around and . shot', the Sunday Mirror reports. The court documents . say Paul told police he simply went along with his older friend and . didn't believe his friend was serious about killing his stepfather. But in 2010 Paul was sentenced to 25 years in prison, for conspiring to fatally shoot 49-year-old Danner. In December last year, the Indiana Court of Appeals threw out Paul's guilty plea and sentence, saying a juvenile court judge rushed when he waived the case to adult court. The appellate court ordered a new hearing to determine if Paul should be retried in a juvenile court. However it is a massive gamble because if the court decides that Paul should be retried as an adult, for the more serious crime of murder, he could be sentenced to 65 years and remain incarcerated until the age of 77. As things stand, Paul is due to spend the next three years in a juvenile facility before being transferred to Indiana's notoriously tough Adult prison system. His attorney, Monica Foster, said: 'You really can't appreciate just how horrific the adult prison system is unless you've been there. 'For the last 30 years I've been in and out of the adult prison system in the State of Indiana and I wouldn't let my dog go there for a week, much less a 12-year-old kid.' Tough life: Gingerich now 15, has been described as a role model at Pendleton Juvenile Correction Facility where he is currently incarcerated . His harrowing story is the subject of a new documentary by filmmaker Zara Hayes which is due to be aired on Channel 4 later this week. Paul's mother Nicole said: 'I'm in disbelief with the whole thing. 'Surely if you had an adult male or female who had the brain capacity of a 12-year-old, they would not be tried as an adult.' By all reports Paul has been a model prisoner. He attends school inside the juvenile prison five days a week, where he works hard in the hope that achieving good grades will mean the chance of a good job when he is released. His teachers describe him as a role model and one of the best behaved children in the institution. His father Paul Senior, said: 'I never wanted him to get off scot free. He did commit a crime and I don't want people to see him as a victim because Phil Danner was the victim in this case. 'But you can't throw a child in with adults and expect him not to get screwed up.' Carefree: Gingerich, who will be sent to an . adult prison before he turns 21, said he wishes he had just gone home . the day he discussed killing the man with two friends in a park . Paul is now a long way from the floppy-haired 12-year-old who made that terrible decision three years ago. Now sporting a crew cut, his grey eyes appear to have lost much of their innocence. Prison has  hardened him. But incredibly he says he is grateful for what he has,. He says: 'I believe I have matured faster than other kids my age. 'I'm starting to think before I act more and not be so impulsive. Now I'm more grateful for what I have.'","Paul Gingerich sentenced to 25-years for shooting a friend's stepfather .

"By . Rebecca Camber, Jaya Narain and Colin Fernandez . UPDATED: . 02:11 EST, 26 July 2011 . An arrogant smile on his lips, mass murderer Anders Breivik shows not a shred of remorse as he leaves court. Dressed in a red polo shirt and sweater, the 32-year-old assassin sat calmly in a police vehicle yesterday after admitting killing at least 76 people – but denying criminal responsibility. A prosecutor said he seemed ‘completely unaffected’ by what he had done. Arrogant: Anders Breivik leaves court in an armoured car yesterday, showing not a shred of remorse for his actions that left at least 76 people dead . Police presence: Breivik was escorted by a number of officers as he was driven to the courthouse . Justification: Breivik told the court he had carried out mass slaughter to send a 'strong signal' to people . The Norwegian fanatic has been in close contact with hundreds of British right-wing extremists for two years, it emerged last night. He chatted about ‘tactics’ on social networking sites with hundreds of members of the English Defence League (EDL) and the British National Party (BNP) and attended demonstrations and meetings here. The revelations came as: . Senior MPs demanded an inquiry into the killer’s links with Britain after it was claimed that he met extremists in London as recently as last year, as well as attending EDL rallies in London and Newcastle. Anti-extremist campaign groups and think tanks called on the Government to classify EDL as a far-Right organisation. Escort: A pair of armoured cars carrying Breivik drives through Oslo on the way to yesterday's court hearing . Outriders: Breivik arrived at the court without incident despite fears of a possible revenge attack . No entry: The doors of the courthouse in Oslo stand closed as journalists and members of the public crowd outside . The Prime Minister, who discussed the massacre with security chiefs at a National Security Council meeting, said the killer’s links to groups in Britain were being taken ‘extremely seriously’. He said: ‘We are still investigating these claims, so I don’t want to give out partial information. We want to get to the bottom of this before making public announcements. But we take these things extremely seriously.’ Mr Cameron, who was at the Norwegian Embassy in London to sign a book of condolence, went on: ‘Everyone in Britain shares in the sorrow and the anger at the despicable killing that took place on Friday. Britain and Norway have been good allies and neighbours in very dark days before. ‘We know that the resilience and the courage and the decency of our Norwegian friends will overcome this evil.’ David Cameron signed a book of condolence for the victims of the attacks at the Norwegian Embassy yesterday, before confirming the the killer's links to groups in Britain were being taken 'extremely seriously' He added: ‘After such a dreadful event the British Government must of course review our own security at home.’ Thousands gathered in the centre of Oslo at noon to observe a minute’s silence for those who lost their lives in Friday’s massacre. Statements: Judge Kim Heger said Breivik had told him at the hearing there were two more cells in his organisation and that he wanted to save Europe from a Muslim takeover . Immediately afterwards many made their way to the city’s court to await Breivik’s arrival. While a few jeered as the heavily armed police convoy arrived, most simply stood and stared at the building housing the country’s most vilified individual. The hearing was closed, denying Breivik the opportunity to make a public statement in front of the world’s media. Later the judge said that Breivik had alluded to ‘two other cells’ in his network – a claim he also made in a ‘manifesto’ published hours before the twin assaults. But he also maintained he had been acting alone. Police in Oslo said they would now probe the ‘two cells’ claims by Breivik. Judge Kim Heger said that Breivik had told him that he wanted to save Europe from a Muslim takeover. He said his bombing and shooting rampage was intended to send a ‘strong signal to the people’ and deter future recruitment to the Norwegian Labour Party, which he blamed for allowing ‘mass imports of Muslims’. The judge said: ‘Even though the accused has acknowledged the facts of the case, he has not pleaded criminal responsibility. ‘The accused has made statements that require further investigation, including that “there are two more cells in our organisation”.’ Breivik was remanded in solitary confinement for eight weeks with a ban on letters, access to media and visitors. The Foreign Secretary William Hague confirmed that a senior officer from Scotland Yard’s Counter Terrorism Command is liaising with police in Norway. United in grief: Thousands of people hold aloft flowers as they take part in this 'rose march' in honour of the victims in Oslo . Solemn affair: (from left) Princess Martha Louise, crownprince Haakon, crownprincess Mette-Marit, former Norway's Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and the chairman of the Labour Youth Movement (AUF), Eskil Pedersen, take part in the march . Growing tributes: Thousands of flowers have been left outside in cathedral square in Oslo to mark the deaths . Breivik has claimed he was recruited by two English Right-wing extremists at a UK meeting in 2002 attended by seven others. In a rambling 1,500-page manifesto posted on the internet shortly before his attacks, Breivik praised the EDL. He wrote: ‘I used to have more than 600 EDL members as Facebook friends and have spoken with tens of EDL members and leaders. ‘In fact I was one of the individuals who supplied them with processed ideological material (including rhetorical strategies) in the very beginning.’ Victims: Trond Berntsen (left), the step-brother of the Crown Princess of Norway, was a security guard at the event. Tore Eikeland, 21, was described as one of Norway's most promising young politicians . Missing: (left to right) Hanne Kristine Fridtun, Jamil Rafal Yasin and Tarald Mjelde have not been seen since the shooting on Friday. A source within the EDL said last . night: ‘I know people within the English Defence League who claim Anders . Breivik was at some of those meetings. ‘Also, . people who he knows have been over to the UK many times and are very . active within the EDL circles in London. There are definite connections . between this man and the UK.’ Matthew . Collins, spokesman for the anti-fascist organisation Searchlight, told . the Daily Mail: ‘EDL was his inspiration, ideologically and . politically.’ Breivik also referred to the BNP 23 times in his 1,500-page manifesto. The . English Defence League, which has risen to prominence over the last two . years with its anti-Islamic protests, has denied ‘any official contact’ with the killer. Nothing suspicious: The purchase of fertiliser by Breivik was flagged by security services but considered not relevant as they believed it was for use on his farm . Conservative . Patrick Mercer, former chairman of the Commons counter-terrorism . subcommittee, said authorities should investigate the risk of a plot in . Britain. It emerged that . Breivik had been on a Norwegian security watchlist since March after his . name was linked to the purchase of chemicals from a Polish supplier. However, . the head of Norway’s police intelligence agency said this was a . ‘superfluous archive’ and they had not followed it up because he had . only bought £11 worth of the chemicals.","Anders Breivik admits killing 76 - but denies criminal responsibility .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:28 EST, 20 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:13 EST, 21 November 2012 . Abe Lincoln was born in a log cabin but his son built himself a mansion. Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's only child to survive to adulthood, built the Georgian Revival home, called Hildene, as a seasonal dream home for his wife Mary Harlan Lincoln and their children. But Hildene is no dusty museum. Located on 412 acres (167 hectares) between two spectacular mountain ranges, the homestead offers a feeling of warmth, family and hospitality along with the history lessons. Scroll down to watch trailer . Grand: Although Abraham Lincoln was born in a modest cabin, his son Robert Todd Lincoln built the mansion Hildene in Manchester, Vermont . Elegant: The dining room at Hildene which is built in the Georgian Revival style . Traditional: Lincoln descendants lived at the home until 1975 and used it as a getaway from Washington . The site is expecting a boost in . interest thanks to the new Steven Spielberg movie Lincoln, which stars . Daniel Day-Lewis as the former president and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as his . son. The Hildene . staff is looking forward to welcoming more visitors and teaching them . about the place where Lincoln descendants lived until 1975, said Paula . Maynard, press director and group tour leader. 'I've been telling people for eight years, which is when I first got here, that this movie was coming, and we'd get to tell this part of the story,' Maynard says. 'I think people stopped believing me. ... But we expect visitation to grow from it, and it's been growing anyway between 8 and 10 per cent annually.' One frequently asked question is what Hildene means. Maynard says the word combines phrases that mean 'hill and valley with a stream,' and that Robert Todd Lincoln apparently had the name in mind from the start of construction in 1903. History on the silver screen: Daniel Day Lewis as Abraham Lincoln and Joseph Gordon Levitt as his son Robert Todd in the Spielberg movie Lincoln . Glory: A bust of president Abraham Lincoln at the Robert Todd Lincoln mansion in Vermont . Ascent to greatness: The front stairway at the home which was built in 1905 by Robert Todd, Lincoln's only son to survive into adulthood . Full steam ahead: The Pullman car which sits in the driveway of the elegant Georgian getaway of the Lincoln family . Visitors also are curious about the relationship between Robert Todd Lincoln and his mother, Mary Todd Lincoln, whom he had committed to a hospital for mental illness. Decades later, in a bedroom that served as his quarters in later years when he suffered from arthritis, papers were found in a closet safe with medical documentation that validated his decision to hospitalize her. Before she died, the two were reconciled. Before building Hildene, Robert Todd Lincoln had served in Washington as secretary of war for President James Garfield and overseas as the United States' ambassador to Great Britain for President Benjamin Harrison. But Robert Todd Lincoln apparently had wanted to live in Vermont for many years. His law partner Edward Isham was born in Bennington and bought a home in Manchester 15 years before Hildene was completed. After Lincoln became chairman of Pullman Company in 1897, at the time one of the country's biggest companies, he could afford to build the house of his dreams. Maynard says, however, that the Lincolns 'were not lavish and always wanted simple elegance. The Lincolns' main social life was in Chicago. 'They lived there half the year and here half the year. When they came to Vermont, it was for the same reasons we do – for a getaway'. Classic: Historians say that the family were not lavish and wanted simple elegance at the home . Sweeping: A view out the window of the Robert Todd Lincoln mansion Hildene which is located between two mountain ranges . Music from the home's 1,000-pipe organ draws visitors in at the first step into the entry foyer. The parlor, which looks out onto a beautiful east-facing patio and garden with vistas of the Taconic and Green Mountains, could easily be the gathering spot for a modern martini party, book club meeting or holiday meal. Like much of the 8,000-square-foot home (almost 750 square meters), the room's traditional yet tasteful decor seems grand but not showy – very New England. The walls, for example, were made to look like mahogany but were really made of poplar. 'Robert was like his dad, he counted his pennies,' Maynard said. The kitchen includes the latest in 20th-century gadgetry and is next to a lovely dining room with a table that could sit about 12 but no more for a formal meal. Across the hall was the servants' dining room, another comfortable room that would probably be the hub of the house if it were lived in now. Part of history: The stove pipe hat and mirror used by Abraham Lincoln is seen at the Robert Todd Lincoln mansion Hildene . Well-stocked: The kitchen at the Georgian Revival home which is popular with visitors to the Vermont area . The tour also includes a look at the Victorian-style master suite, the guest room where President William Howard Taft stayed and an office with an early predecessor to the copying machine. A luxury Pullman Sunbeam travel train car sits along the winding driveway. Also located on the estate is an observatory with telescope, an agricultural center and many trails that can be used by day hikers, picnickers and, in the winter, snowshoers and cross-country skiers. Throughout the year there are programs on topics such as composting and butterfly gardens. During the holiday season, the home is decorated as if it were Christmas Eve 1912. That was a year Robert Todd Lincoln was being heavily courted to run for president, said Maynard. He chose to stay home.","Renewed interest in Vermont estate Hildene thanks to  Steven Spielberg movie Lincoln, starring .

Five family members were murdered by a neighbour who set fire to their baby’s pushchair because she was fed up with it being left outside her front door, a court heard yesterday. It caused a ‘devastating’ inferno which trapped Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her partner Liam Timbrell, 23, their baby son Charlie, 15 months, Miss Shiers’s nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two, in their first-floor flat. As the fire took hold, Mr Timbrell was heard in the background of a 999 call played to the jury screaming: ‘Oh my God, oh my God, we’re going to die.’ Victims: Skye Allen, aged two years, and Bailey Allen, four, who were killed in the fire in the first-floor flat in Prestatyn, North Wales . Fire deaths: Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, and her 15-month-old son Charlie were both killed following the blaze . He and Charlie were brought out alive . by firefighters. Despite being badly burned Mr Timbrell managed to tell . police that, moments earlier, he heard his neighbour Melanie Smith, 43, . shouting through the letterbox: ‘I’m going to burn your house down.’ Mr Timbrell and Charlie died in . hospital. Miss Shiers, Bailey and Skye, who were the children of Miss . Shiers’s brother Steve Allen and were sleeping over for the night, . perished in a loft bedroom. Mold Crown Court heard that the fire was . deliberately started by jobless Smith, a mother of two who lived in a . flat below. She had allegedly repeatedly rowed . with Miss Shiers over Charlie’s pushchair being left in a communal . hallway, as well as the couple making noise upstairs. Jealous Smith had also accused Miss . Shiers of having a sexual relationship with her partner Steven Clarkson, . 45, an allegation, said Ian Murphy QC, prosecuting, for which there was . ‘no basis at all’. Blaze victims: Liam Timbrell with Lee-Anna Shiers and their baby Charlie shortly after his birth. All three of them died in the fire . Accused: Melanie Smith, centre, sits in the dock as she listens to evidence on the first day of her trial yesterday in this court drawing . On one occasion Smith, a heavy drinker, is alleged . to have told Miss Shiers: ‘I will set your house on fire with you and . your kids in.’ Seven weeks later, it is alleged, she carried out the . threat. The jury was told that Miss Shiers . habitually kept the pushchair in the downstairs hallway, pushed up . against the door which gave access to a staircase leading to the . upstairs flat in a block in Prestatyn, North Wales. 'I will set your house on fire with you and your kids in' What Melanie Smith allegedly told neighbour Lee-Anna Shiers . Mr Murphy said that on October 19 last . year ‘this pushchair and items left on top of it were deliberately . ignited with a naked flame... and a devastating fire developed rushing . up the stairs to the flat above and killing all of those inside’. In the months leading up to the . tragedy, it is alleged, Smith made repeated threats of arson, beginning . in August last year when she threatened to burn down the house of . another local woman, Samantha Schofield, who she also believed was . having an affair with Mr Clarkson. Then, on September 1 last year, Smith . got into a drunken argument with Miss Shiers, saying: ‘I am going to . set your house on fire with you and your kids in it.’ She was later overheard accusing Mr . Clarkson of sleeping with Miss Shiers, adding: ‘I will burn the house . down with her and the kids in it.’ Defendant: Melanie Smith arrives at Mold Crown Court yesterday underneath a blanket. She is accused of the murder of five people who died in the fire . Fire: The smoke-damaged property in Prestatyn after the blaze which killed five people last year . On the day of the fire Smith told a . friend she was going to ‘torch or bomb’ her flat so the landlord . wouldn’t get any money for rent. Mr Murphy said that Smith also repeated . three times that she was going to ‘kill,’ although she was not specific . about who or when. On the same day Smith also admitted to . her hairdresser that she didn’t like her neighbours and hoped ‘they’d . burn to the ground’ because then the council would have to find her a . new home. Later, she was visited by her landlord . and began ‘ranting aggressively’ about Miss Shiers, calling her a . ‘scruffy, dirty bitch’. Smith then went out drinking before returning . home shortly before 9pm. Fifty minutes later a neighbour, Joe Shelley, spotted flames inside the porch of the flats and made the 999 call. Smith, of Prestatyn, denies five . counts of murder and one count of making a threat to destroy or damage . property. The trial continues.

Many of them did not know this meant the site then uploaded their entire address book and stored it afterwards. Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner said it would now offer users the option to ‘upload your address book’ or ‘import your contacts’ to make it clearer. She said: ‘We want to be clear and transparent in our communications with users. Along those lines, in our next app updates, which are coming soon, we are updating the language associated with Find Friends – to be more explicit.’ The practice by a giant such as Twitter raises more concerns about the privacy implications posed by social networking sites which are used by an estimated 37million Britons. There is no suggestion the San Francisco-based firm was using the data – which it said was securely encrypted – for anything other than finding contacts for its customers. But critics say the lack of ‘informed consent’ raises questions about other less reputable sites which could harvest details to sell on, or potentially leave customers open to identity fraud. Jack Dorsey, executive chairman of Twitter: The company has said that it will change its apps so they make it clearer when they are transmitting and using private information . Apple iPhone 4S: The company moved to stem controversy over how apps from networks such as Twitter access, transmit and store the highly private information in users' address books . The admission also raises difficult . questions for Apple, makers of the iPhone, as to why it had been allowed . to happen, after the firm said such harvesting was a violation of its . policy. Two American congressman wrote to Apple about the practice, prompting it to toughen measures to make sure . applications did not harvest data without ‘explicit  user approval’. In a letter addressed to Apple Chief . Executive Tim Cook, Representatives Henry Waxman of California and G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, both Democrats on the House Energy and . Commerce Committee, asked Apple to clarify its developer guidelines and . the measures taken by the company to screen apps sold on its App . Store. Apple CEO Tim Cook: Two U.S. legislators wrote to the CEO to request information on Apple's privacy policies relating to apps which upload and transmit the information in users' address books . So far, Twitter has not changed the way it uses data, only amended its policy so that new versions of the app will offer a clear warning that data will be transmitted and used. Twitter's app will still read your address book and transmit and store your data, even now. Sites such as Twitter process data remotely on their own servers, so it's become common practice for sites to build apps which send data back to their own computers. The data is often used to 'link' people to other friends using the service. What has shocked users is that this highly private data is being harvested without their permission. It's also raised issues about how companies use such private data. None of the networks involved has come clean about why they might need to store data for periods alleged to be up to 18 months - or whether they gain a commercial advantage from storing and using this information. Instagram and Foursquare have not issued an apology, but have quietly changed their applications. None of the companies involved has issued a full apology. Apple's move should at least ensure more transparency for consumers about how data is used - although it's clear that social sites will continue to copy, transmit and store this data, just as Twitter has done. The letter came . after Path, a San Francisco start-up that makes a Facebook-like social . networking app, attracted widespread criticism last week after a . Singaporean developer discovered that Path’s iPhone app had been quietly . uploading his contacts’ names and phone numbers onto Path’s servers. The Path incident 'raises questions about whether Apple’s iOS app developer policies and practices may fall short when it comes to protecting the information of iPhone users and their contacts,' the letter said. The legislators’ request for information cast the spotlight squarely onto Apple for the first time since an independent blogger, Dustin Curtis, wrote in a widely distributed post last week that 'there’s a quiet understanding among many iOS app developers that it is acceptable to send a user’s entire address book, without their permission to remote servers and then store it for future reference.' Curtis blamed Apple, writing that he could not 'think of a rational reason for why Apple has not placed any protections on Address Book in iOS.' In their letter to Apple, Waxman and Butterfield, referenced Curtis’ blog post, adding: 'There could be some truth to these claims.' The legislators had asked Apple to submit its response by February 29. Apple yesterday announced it would now require iPhone and iPad apps to seek 'explicit approval'  before accessing users’ address book data, in a bid to stem the growing storm. Twitter is the latest social . networking site to face a scandal over harvesting contact details, after . Facebook came under fire for ‘synchronising’ users’ email address books . to its site. This has since been changed.","Highly private contact information is taken from smartphones and sent to remote computer .

Although he belongs to one of the most endangered primate species in the world, this sifaka lemur scampers across a track looking totally carefree. The black and white lemur shows its dexterity on two legs as it is pictured running along the ground. The trick shot, which makes it appear as if there are five lemurs, was taken by Dale Morris using time-lapse photography. Trick shot: A rare sifaka lemur is captured using time lapse photography as it skips across a path in Madagascar . Up close: British photographer Dale Morris spent time with the charismatic primates during a visit to the African island and captured the curious creatures in action . The British photographer travelled to Madagascar to get close to the charismatic primates. There are more than 100 species of lemur living on the African island and all sifkaka are endangered and are classed as between vulnerable and critically endangered. Mr Morris, 40, was able to capture a vast array of species on camera and his . intimate collection includes multiple shots of a bright-white lemur . scampering across a path and newborn babies clutching onto their . mother's tail. However, the expedition was not without drama. Mr Morris said lemurs, such as the ring-tailed, that are thriving on the island are so used to humans that they can cause trouble. A troop even raided his hotel room when he left the window open. Give it to me: A lemur reaches out as if to grab the camera. Photographer Dale Morris said many lemurs live in nature reserves and are used to tourists . Not camera shy: Most lemurs take no notice of tourists snapping away but these individuals certainly took an interest in the cameras . Happy families: A pair of lemurs cling to a tree in Madagascar, left, while two babies stay close to their mother among the leaves, right .

Prickly situation: A lemur perches among the thorns in a tree, left, while another poses for the camera as it shows off its climbing skills . He said: 'Many of the daytime lemur species live in nature reserves and are quite accustomed to tourists taking their photos. 'They seem to get on with their daily business regardless of who is watching or taking photos of them. 'Some . of them are so used to people that they will raid your hotel room . looking for food if you leave the window open and will even beg at . open-air restaurants. 'A . Lemur did a poo down my shirt during one photo shoot. I also woke up in . my hotel room in Berenty reserve to find a troop of ring tailed lemurs . bouncing around on the bed with me.

Mr Morris, a freelance nature . photographer from north London, also travelled to the spiky forests to . the south of the island to see species of lemur. It can be risky business as the trees are heavily spiked and branches easily break and fall when disturbed by the animals. Mr Morris added: 'I was surprised by how many beautiful lemur species there are - over 100 - and how many of them are close to extinction. ''I learned that once upon a time there were lemur species as large as a man. Now that would have been something to see.'","The image was taken by British photographer Dale Morris who travelled to the African island to observe the lemurs .

A pioneering brain doctor who was unfairly sacked for following his conscience is staging a hunger strike in protest at the 'unfair' treatment of whistleblowers by the NHS. Dr Narinder Kapur, 62, a world authority on brain behaviour, lost his job at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, in 2010. The former president of the British Neuropsychological Society claimed he was kicked out for blowing the whistle over underqualified and unsupervised staff treating patients at the hospital - a practice he claimed was endangering patients. Protest: Dr Narinder Kapur is confronted by security staff outside the Department of Health in London. An employment tribunal went on to rule he had been unfairly dismissed, but he was not reinstated. The doctor today staged the second day of a five day hunger strike outside the Department of Health head office, to protest his and other colleague's treatment for raising concerns about the health service. Dr Kapur believes the NHS is rife with 'failures' and feels staff are not treated or managed correctly, which has lead to the mistreatment of patients. He is calling on the government to impose a complete change to the health service and get rid of a 'dictatorial and secretive' management structure. Dr Kapur will camp outside the building in Westminster, London, for the whole week and if he gets moved on he will decamp to the statue of Gandhi, who has inspired him, in Tavistock square. Dr Kapur said: 'I undertake this five-day hunger-strike with reluctance but with resolve. 'It pains my heart to see how failures in the NHS have contributed directly or indirectly to harming patient care, to a waste of public funds and to distress for NHS staff and their families. 'Over the past two years, I have repeatedly raised my concerns in a wide range of settings - NHS, legal and political - but with no tangible outcome to fix these failures in the NHS. 'I am fortunate that God has given me the strength, knowledge, experience, determination, resources and good health to be able to make a protest in this way. Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where Dr Kapur was dismissed in 2010. Vocal: The doctor next to the sign outlining his grievances with the NHS . 'I regard it as a moral and ethical responsibility to do what I can to bring about changes in the NHS that will benefit a large number of people. 'I take my inspiration from the actions and words of Mahatma Gandhi, whose birthday is this week on October 2, and who also engaged in peaceful protests that included fasting.' During Dr Kapur’s tribunal in July the panel ruled the hospital attempted to fast-track his dismissal by rehearsing witnesses after an investigation was launched into his conduct. The judgement read: 'The principal reason for Dr Kapur’s dismissal was the fact there had been an irredeemable breakdown in trust, confidence and communication between himself on the one hand and a variety of management individuals within the trust organisation.' However, the tribunal found Dr Kapur, who had clashed with staff over how neuropsychology clinics should be run, was 75 per cent responsible for his own downfall. As a result, the panel said he would only receive 25 per cent of any compensation and would not return to work at the hospital. A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'We have taken action to support NHS whistleblowers, including strengthening the NHS constitution and setting up a new helpline to advise staff and help them understand their rights. 'Staff on the frontline know when patient care needs to improve - better support for whistleblowers will help create a culture where staff will be able to raise genuine concerns in good faith, without fear of reprisal.'","Dr Narinder Kapur says NHS whistleblowers are treated unfairly .

Rick Perry today became the biggest Republican name to back an Israeli air strike on Iran, as fears mount about the country's nuclear capabilities. The Texas Governor said he would support Israel on the matter if there is proof Tehran is moving closer to having a nuclear weapon. His comments come as it was claimed Britain and the U.S. are drawing up plans to attack Iran amid growing tensions in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Republican candidate: Rick Perry said he would support an Israeli air strike on Iran if there is proof Tehran is moving closer to having a nuclear weapon . ‘We will support Israel in every way that we can,’ Republican presidential candidate Governor Perry told CNN. ‘Whether it's diplomatic, whether it's economic sanctions, whether it's overt or covert operations - up to and including military action.’ Iran ratcheted up Middle East tensions when its foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi declared the country was ‘ready for war’ with Israel and the West. Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron are said to be preparing for war after reports Iran is stepping up its nuclear capabilities. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s hard-line regime in Tehran has been linked to three assassination plots on foreign soil. 'Madman': President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's hard-line regime in Tehran has been linked to three assassination plots on foreign soil . ‘We cannot afford to allow that madman in Iran to get his hands on a nuclear weapon - period,’ Governor Perry added. A U.N. report on Iran’s . nuclear programme is expected to provide a 'compelling case' that it is secretly building an arsenal of warheads. Iran plans to complain to the United Nations about alleged U.S. ‘terror’ operations, including assassination of its nuclear scientists. Nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said the Swiss ambassador to Iran will be summoned to the Foreign Ministry to be handed ‘documents of U.S. terror plots against Iran’. Copies will be presented by Iran's U.N. envoy to the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York later on Friday, Mr Jalili said. ‘The U.S. is employing terrorism to promote its objectives - we will sue the United States,’ he said. ‘The U.N. needs to take the necessary measures to prosecute and punish the U.S. government for directing terrorist activities (against Iran).’ As speculation mounts that Israel or the U.S. could lead a military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities, the U.N. report made clear it does not believe Tehran’s claims that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. The report by the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency - to be published next week - will stop short of explicitly saying that Iran is making its own N-bombs. But in the technical annex it will give plenty of new details and also add to areas of concern it has briefly mentioned previously. Iran insists its program is for generating electricity. Meanwhile, Governor Perry's campaign has been slipping after swiftly rising to the top of opinion polls when he entered the race for the president in August. In a wide-ranging interview with CNN, Governor Perry defended his moderate stance on illegal immigration, including an in-state tuition program. Graphic: This map of Iran locates the nuclear facilities within the country . ‘I put that in the category of being very wise economically,’ he said. ‘I mean, when you judge are you going to have taxpayers or tax wasters?’ 'We cannot afford to allow that madman in Iran to get his hands on a nuclear weapon - period' Rick Perry . Illegal immigration is a hot-button issue in the GOP. Governor Perry, who was campaigning in Johnston, Iowa, downplayed his slide in the polls. ‘I know how to run an election, I know how to take the message to the people and that's what we going to keep doing,’ Governor Perry said. ‘So, we will stay focused, we will stay on message, and the end of the day, it will all turn out just right.’ February, 2009: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei said Iran was not allowing U.N. inspectors to determine if it was working developing nuclear weapons. June, 2009: . IAEA reveals it was blocked from inspecting nuclear facilities, but Mr . ElBaradei voices opposition to Israel support for military strike, . saying it would turn region into 'ball of fire'. Concerns: The Bushehr nuclear plant . July, 2009: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had agreed with President Barack Obama to engage with Iran until the end of the year, but the country would be free to take on the 'existential threat' with military force after the deadline passed. Mr Obama also gave Iran until September to adhere to IAEA proposals or 'face consequences'. Iran threatens to strike back at Israel if its nuclear facilities were targeted. September, 2009: Second enrichment facility is revealed 20 miles north of Qom, Iran. January, 2010: Masoul Ali Mohammadi - a particle physicist - is killed by a remote-control bomb as he left for work.

October, 2010: Stuxnet computer worm infects systems at Natanz enrichment plant, causing centrifuges to crash and suspending work.

Marie Claire has launched the Take A Good Look campaign to ensure that women are informed, empowered and protected when it comes to cosmetic surgery . As the editor of one of the UK’s leading glossy magazines, and a forty-something woman who wants to look good, I consider myself to be well informed about the beauty industry and the world of cosmetic surgery. Marie Claire has always prided itself on investigative journalism, in the past we’ve dug into the murky world of cosmetic surgery tourism, and we’ve also reported on the shocking PIP scandal, when it came to light that 45,000 women had given faulty breast implants containing industrial fluid. But PIP aside, like most people I had assumed that any surgical procedure that takes place in this country would surely have to be safe, and that if you can walk down your high street and get a shot of botox or some crows feet filled while on the way to do the weekly shop, then surely those products must be licensed or have undergone rigorous testing too? Yet when I was invited onto Sir Bruce Keogh’s committee to review the regulation of cosmetic interventions, I was truly shocked at how little protection UK consumers have in an industry that’s now worth nearly £3bn a year to our economy. This is why Marie Claire has launched the ‘Take A Good Look’ campaign to urge the government to implement the recommendations of the committee as soon as possible to ensure that women are informed, empowered and protected. And we also want to encourage our readers to take responsibility too: to ask the right questions, do the research and be realistic about the outcomes of any of these procedures, because the truth is, very often they don’t live up to the expectation. Thanks in part to the glut of real-life makeover shows extolling the virtues of liposuction, fillers and teeth whitening, as well as our bizarre national obsession with programmes like TOWIE, there has been an explosion in the number of cosmetic procedures taking place in the UK over the last five years. With nine out of ten of those being Botox and dermal fillers, it seems that women as young as 20 are happily incorporating them into their beauty regimes alongside regular manicures and blowdrys. This huge increase in demand, coupled with a lack of regulation, has encouraged far too many unqualified, dubious characters, looking to make a fast buck to set up in business. It seems that women as young as 20 are happily incorporating Botox and fillers into their beauty regimes alongside regular manicures and blowdrys . I’ve heard shocking stories about pop-up Botox clinics in places like hairdressers and nightclubs, where young women queue up to sign a consent form, pen in one hand, drink in the other, and then have fillers injected into their lips. When it goes wrong, as it very easily can do, there is nowhere to turn to for help, and often these women feel too ashamed or embarrassed to take any action. Frequently, it is the good old NHS that has to pick up the tab for putting it right. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. When editor Trish Halpin invited onto Sir Bruce Keogh's committee to review the regulation of cosmetic interventions, she was shocked at how little protection UK consumers have . During my time on the review committee, we delved much further, looking in detail at products used for surgical and non-surgical procedures, the people who administer them, the way they are advertised and the advice and support patients and consumers are given before, during and after their treatments. Our final recommendations, published . this week, include establishing an implant register with fillers falling . under the same controls as other implants (it was extremely difficult . to trace the 45,000 women given PIP implants as there was no register, . many of the companies who used them had gone out of business and a lot . of the women didn’t even know which implants they’d been given). There . are currently nearly 200 fillers available in the UK, yet only 14 are . licensed for use in the US, so from now on, fillers will also have to . pass vigorous safety appraisals, be prescription only and only those . with appropriate skills can administer them. Other . recommendations include a register of qualified and assessed surgeons . who practice in the UK to prevent fly in fly out doctors and, very . importantly an independent ombudsman for women to go to when something . does go wrong. So . after everything I’ve learned during my eight months on the review . committee, would I have cosmetic surgery? Having been under the knife . for two back operations, I would never want to subject my body to a . surgical procedure if it wasn’t absolutely necessary. But Botox? I wouldn’t be averse to a shot or two of that. I’ll definitely be doing my research beforehand though.

A man and his 'totally devoted' mother killed themselves by jumping off a cliff at a renowned suicide spot just days after he was arrested on suspicion of possessing child abuse pictures. The bodies of Elizabeth Gosling, 81, and 58-year-old Christopher Gosling were retrieved from the base of Beachy Head, near Eastbourne, East Sussex, on March 21. Two days before they died, Mr Gosling had been arrested on suspicion of possessing child abuse pictures. He had been freed on police bail pending further inquiries. Close: Christopher Gosling, left, and his 'totally devoted' mother Elizabeth Gosling, right, killed themselves by jumping off a cliff at a renowned suicide spot just days after Mr Gosling was arrested on suspicion of possessing child abuse pictures . Josephine Carroll, the niece of Mrs Gosling, who was known as Betty, told an inquest at Eastbourne that the mother and son were very close. She said that in recent years, Mr Gosling had been suffering personal problems which she believed had led to him suffering from depression. She said: 'All was not well with Christopher, he may have been suffering from some sort of depression. 'He was out of work for a bit because of sickness and he’d been having problems with one particular person at work, Betty indicated he may have been bullied.' The inquest heard that Mr Gosling, who worked as an information change manager for NHS Wales had been in discussion about a possible change in his position in the days before his death. But he had sent a hand-written letter of resignation to his employer dated March 20. Grim: The bodies of Elizabeth Gosling, 81, and 58-year-old Christopher Gosling were retrieved from the base of Beachy Head, near Eastbourne, East Sussex, on March 21 . HR officer Vicki Harris said that management had been 'surprised' to receive the letter and the inquest also heard that Mr Gosling was financially 'comfortable'. Mrs Carroll continued: 'He never married, had no children. 'He was an only child, his mother idolised him, they were very happy living together. 'He was a very polite and politically-correct type of person. They were totally devoted to each other.' She said that Mrs Gosling, a retired secretary who was born in Cobh, Ireland, had been a healthy, happy person who had a close group of friends in Cardiff. The inquest heard that her husband, Herbert, a retired administrator, died in 2010. Mrs Carroll added: 'I couldn’t see Betty doing anything like suicide unless something catastrophic had happened and something catastrophic had happened. 'I could see Betty taking this course of action if she thought her son was likely to be punished, she had no-one else apart from him.' She said that she believed her aunt had acted voluntarily because her cousin was a non-violent person and they had driven together from Cardiff to Beachy Head. She added: 'I would have thought for her there was no life without Christopher or if he had been imprisoned there would be no life for her. Evidence: Mrs Josephine Carroll, niece of Elizabeth Gosling, second from right, leaves the inquest, with family members . 'It’s very tragic.' She added that following her son’s arrest: 'The whole world crashed around her in a couple of hours.' The inquest heard that the pair, from Cardiff, arrived at the Courtlands Hotel on the evening before and took rooms for the night. Owner Sandeed Bawa described how they came down together in the morning and Mrs Gosling stopped to talk to her while Mr Gosling left to go straight to his Vauxhall Vectra car which was later found parked at the cliff-top. Ms Bawa said: 'He was very edgy, he just walked straight out, it was the mother who was talking to me most of the time.' The inquest heard that Coastguard officer Stuart McNab spotted the two bodies at the foot of the cliffs and initiated their recovery by a cliff rescue team. Post mortem examinations showed that both mother and son died of multiple injuries and neither had alcohol or drugs in their bodies. The inquest heard the Mr Gosling’s police bail notice following his arrest was found in his car following his death. Detective Sergeant David Tye, of Sussex Police, said that Mr Gosling had made 'substantial admissions' during his interview with South Wales Police. Mr Tye said that a risk assessment was carried out when Mr Gosling was released on bail and he was not considered to be a danger to himself. Notorious: Signs advertising the phone number for the Samaritans are posted yards from the cliff edge and members of the Beachy Head Chaplaincy Team have carried out regular patrols since 2004 . He said that there was no evidence that Mrs Gosling had been coerced into joining her son. He said: 'She would have felt life was unbearable, there’s also the inter-dependence they had.' Alan Craze, coroner for East Sussex, ruled that both mother and son committed suicide. He said: 'I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that Christopher took his own life.'If that’s the case I can have no doubt that his mother took her own life. 'She was an entirely willing participant, it’s dreadful to think about but that’s what I think it was.' The case was referred by South Wales Police to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Mr Craze asked for South Wales Police to be made aware of his concerns of how suspects are assessed when released on bail. The 530ft (161.5m) chalk cliffs at Beachy Head, at the eastern end of the South Downs National Park, have long been a magnet for people wishing to end their lives.

But now as many as one in 20 couples to chose to live apart. And according to Sarah Essig, it may just be the secret of a happy union. This year she and husband Tom will celebrate their second wedding anniversary and both say they have never been happier. Miles apart: Sarah and Tom Essig may live 3677 miles apart with her living in the USA and he in Dorset in the UK but they believe that's the secret to a happy marriage . But Sarah and Tom don’t just live in separate homes. They live in separate countries. Tom lives 3677 miles from Sarah’s Dorset home in Virginia, USA. The happy couple have not ruled out living together in the future, but have no immediate plans to do so. Sarah, 53, says: ‘ Yes it’s unconventional but it works for us and we are incredibly happy. ‘We love each other deeply and we are married and plan to spend the rest of our lives as a couple. Living in separate countries doesn’t make our relationship any less important. In fact it has benefits. ‘People can me quick to make assumptions about my marriage because my husband and I chose to live in separate counties, but I want people to know it can work.’ According to research the number of men and women living apart as couples has increased by 40 per cent in the last decade. It is estimated that one million couples now keep a separate property. Long-distance love: The couple met on a cruise in 2008 and wed in summer 2011 . Happy together: The happy couple have not ruled out living together in the future, but have no immediate plans to do so because of commitments they have to their children with ex partners . But for Sarah, it wasn’t a lifestyle choice to live apart from the man she loves, more a matter of practicalities. The couple met on cruise in 2008 shortly after Sarah’s marriage had ended. Mother-of-two Sarah was holidaying with a friend while American widow Tom, now 59, was on aboard with his daughter when they got chatting at dinner. Sarah says: ‘I certainly was not looking for a relationship and neither was Tom. I’d been through a divorce and he had recently lost his wife of 24 years to cancer. ‘But the more we talked, the more we connected and we ended up spending the whole holiday together talking. Love at first sight: The couple met on cruise in 2008. Sarah was holidaying with a friend while American widow Tom was on aboard with his daughter when they got chatting at dinner . ‘We really understood each other and knew before the cruise ended that somehow or other we would remain in each others lives.’ In fact the couple met up again in London just a few weeks later. ‘It just affirmed what we already knew, that we wanted to be a couple. But we already knew that our situation – both of us having children that needed us in different countries – meant living together was not an option so we went into it with our eyes open.’ After meeting again the couple spoke constantly on skype – which Sarah describes as a ‘best friend’ for couples living or working in separate countries. In the months that followed they planned more trips to see each other. Technology: After meeting, the couple spoke constantly on skype which they describe as a 'best friend' ‘It meant the time we spent together was always quality time and we were always very excited about meeting up. ‘In the past my relationships have all been about stability and security but by the time I met Tom I already had that in my life and instead our relationship was more about fun, excitement and passion. Sarah’s family situation made it impossible for her to consider moving to the USA with Tom. Her marriage ended after ten years and her children now aged 12 and 16 remained in the home with their father while Sarah moved into a place nearby so she could still see them everyday. ‘I didn’t want to be selfish and cause any more disruption by insisting they leave their home to move into a new house with me. Reunited: Tom wanted to remain close to support his children through college after their mother sadly passed away but he and Sarah take lots of holidays together when they can . ‘But even though my children don’t live with me full time they are still my life and my priority.  Even when it became obvious my relationship with Tom was serious it never entered my head to move. Similarly, Tom, a former Homelands security officer who now works as a security consultant, also felt he could not leave his two children. Though older, they found it hard to cope with their mother’s death from cancer and Tom wanted to remain close to support them through college. But that didn’t stop the couple getting married on July 11 2011. ‘We wanted to marry to show our commitment and also because it would make our trips to see each other easier when we went through customs – which was a lot, ‘ laughs Sarah. United: The couple married on July 11 2011 to prove their commitment to each other . ‘We decided on a Vegas wedding with just the two of us present so our families could watch online without spending on expensive flights.’ Their honeymoon was their eighth cruise together after which they returned home alone. ‘Yes there are times when it is hard, but it’s no different for couples in the Armed Forces. You get used to it. ‘I’m sure some people thought we were barmy getting married while living in different countries with no intention of sharing a home, but so what? It must be love: Sarah took redundancy from her job as a graphic designer to be free to visit Tom more often . Cruising: The couple are currently planning their 13th cruise together . ‘He is the man of my dreams and we’re happy so who can judge that.’ Sarah took redundancy from her job as a graphic designer to be free to visit Tom more often. The couple say they make their marriage work by spending at least half an hour a day ‘ together’ talking on their webcams. ‘The time zone can be tricky to manage because when it’s evening here Tom is just waking up so we might be in different moods but we are used to that now. At the moment they are planning their 13th cruise together over two weeks in April. ‘I can’t wait to see Tom and I know we will have a fantastic time. ‘I’m sure one day we might live together, but that doesn’t man we are not a genuine and very happy couple in the meantime.’ One day: They hope to live together one day but are happy in the meantime.

A typical rambunctious college get-together grew into a massive block party Saturday that 15 police officers and a SWAT vehicle were forced to break up using tear gas and pepper spray. Known as a something of a party school, Colorado State University is likely no stranger to tamer soirees of 50 or so beer-swilling students. So nothing seemed out of the ordinary when, at around 8:30pm on April 27, Fort Collins, Colorado police showed up to a party of that size to address a noise complaint. Scroll down for video . Dangerous: A party at Colorado State University, pictured, that began with 50 students soon swelled to 800 before police stepped in with tear gas . Police left, but when they came back things had taken a turn. Though only two hours had passed, when cops came back at 11pm, the group had swelled to a full-on block party with anywhere from 300 to 800 wild students. Revelers representing a row of six or seven condominiums, just a few blocks from CSU’s campus, yelled ‘F*** the police!’ and ‘Go CSU.’ Eyewitnesses told the CSU college . paper the Rocky Mountain Collegian that people were hanging from streetlights, climbing onto house . roofs and even the roof of one car that they caused to collapse. ‘I’d . call that a riot,’ Ft. Collins police Lt. Russell Reed told the . Collegian. ‘When our officers have to use gas to get . themselves out of a situation because of the immaturity of the crowd… . yeah, that’s a riot. As police tried to break up what had become dangerous situation, some students’ verbal assaults became physical. Wild: One student took to Twitter to document the wild party that cops ended with riot gear after it swelled to 800 with the help of social media . Officers were hit by beer bottles hurled through the air and that’s when they decided to fire cans of tear gas into the crowd. ‘I got gassed so bad,’ said senior Max Firth. ‘I couldn’t see, I couldn’t breathe. I just started running away.’ One student sporting a head wound even reported getting hit directly by a tear gas canister. Ft. Collins police spokeswoman Rita Davis said in a release that three officers incurred minor injuries and were transported to a hospital for treatment. Students said the party got so unwieldy after news of it spread through social media sites like Facebook. Lt. Reed said not enough officers were on hand to make any arrests from the huge crowd, but that some of his men recorded the unfortunate incident and plan to use footage to make arrests in the future. Reed said charges could include inciting destruction of life or property, a class six felony with a minimum sentence of a year in jail, and inciting a riot.

Beached: A 28-foot-long dead basking shark which was found washed ashore on a Rhode Island beach . Gigantic: The basking shark is the second largest creature to roam the seas . Police contacted the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management which then asked Mystic Aquarium to investigate. The aquarium sent a staff member to the beach who took photos of the shark. Biologists with the Northeast Fisheries Science Center are expected to perform a necropsy to determine the cause of death. Basking Shark: Although it's the second largest living fish and looks menacing, they are slow-moving and generally harmless, feeding on plankton rather than people . Unusual sight: The shark washed ashore on Misquamicut State Beach, a state park in Westerly Rhode Island . The strong currents that run along the eastern seaboard of the United States lead all manner of wildlife to be washed ashore: . According to Mystic Aquarium, which . sent staff members to the scene, basking sharks are giant migratory fish . that feed on nothing but plankton. They are common in New England . waters. While their body shape and size resemble that of great white sharks, basking sharks can be differentiated by their massive jaws and gill slits. Basking sharks are filter feeders that sieve small animals from the water. As the basking shark swims with its mouth open, masses of water filled with prey flow through its mouth. The prey includes plankton, invertebrates, baby fish, and fish eggs. After closing its mouth, the shark uses gill rakers that filter the nourishment from the water. The basking shark is also called the sunfish, the bone shark, the elephant shark, the sailfish shark, and the big mouth shark. This particular shark is believed to have died from natural causes before washing ashore. The migratory species – a filter feeder not harmful to humans - is common from Canada from Florida. According to BBC Nature, only the whale shark is larger than the basking shark. Female basking sharks are up to 33 feet; males are up to 45 feet and weighs up to 4 tons. Despite a superficial similarity to the fearsome great white shark and a massive jaw one metre wide, basking sharks are actually harmless filter feeders. They use more than 5,000 gill rakers to strain plankton from around 1.5 million litres of water per hour. Basking sharks are born travelers, covering large distances in search of food, at the very leisurely pace of only three miles per hour.","Shark washed ashore and was reported to police on Sunday morning .

Instagram has abandoned wording in its new terms-of-service agreement that sparked outcry from users who feared it meant their photos could appear in advertisements. In a blog post published late last night, the popular mobile photo-sharing service says it has changed back the advertising section of its terms of service to the original wording. There was outrage this week after the app published new terms on Monday which appeared to give it rights over all its users' photos and data to promote 'sponsored content'. Anyone who did not agree with the new terms were invited to delete their accounts. U-turn: Instagram has announced it will abandon controversial sections of its new terms of service after a celebrity-led user backlash against wording that appeared to give it rights over uploaded photos . But the aggressive strategy failed when a string of high-profile celebrities users, including reality TV star Kim Kardashian and actor Seth Green, took to Twitter to say they would delete their Instagram accounts. The service's celebrity users were among the many to join a chorus of criticism as a widespread media and public backlash gathered pace. Instagram, which allows people to add filters and effects to photos and share them easily on the Internet, was acquired by Facebook earlier this year for $715million (£440million). In a blog post last night, Instagram . co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom apologised for a failure to . 'communicate our intentions clearly.' The . terms of service changes pertaining to advertising have been reversed, . he said, and restored to what they had been before the changes announced . on Monday. The updated . terms also appear to omit a controversial provision which had stated . that if a child under the age of 18 used the service, it implied his or . her parent had tacitly agreed to Instagram's terms. Apology: Instagram co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom published a blog late last night where he announced the policy reversal . However, the new terms still contain a mandatory arbitration clause, which is not included in terms of service for other leading social media companies like Twitter, Google, YouTube or even Facebook itself. That immunises Instagram from many forms of liability, according to legal experts. Internet experts said Instagram had been very aggressive in asserting its rights to user information and inviting anyone who did not agree to delete their accounts within a few weeks. The updated terms still say that anyone who accesses Instagram agrees to be bound by the new terms which are slated to go into effect on January 19. Also, Instagram kept language which gave it the ability to place ads in conjunction with user content, and 'that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.' Outrage boiled over after Instagram adopted several sections from Facebook's terms of service which seemed to reveal how it hoped to operate as a profitable business in the future. Foremost among them was the company allowing itself to put users' names, likenesses, photos and actions online next to any product it is paid to promote. Instagram's home page describes the service as 'free', however the new terms made clear that users effectively hand over the rights to their pictures and personal information as a quid pro quo in exchange for access. Clause two of updated the Rights section of Instagram's new terms of service said: 'You agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.' What this seemed to mean was that Instagram can now takes its users' identities and data and put them next to any business partner who pays for the privilege of advertising on the site. Angry: Amongst those threatening to leave Instagram are Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Khloe Kardashian . Kim and Khloe Kardashian, Natasha Bedingfield and Jordin Sparks were among the string of celebrities who lined up to criticise the move on Twitter. 'YIKES! Bye instagram,' Sparks tweeted, while Bedingfield added: 'Bummer.' Reality superstar Kim tweeted: 'I really loved Instagram :-( I need to review this new policy. I don't think its fair.' Her sister wrote: 'Wow…I just read over Instagram’s new policy…so sad, looks like I might be deleting my Instagram after Jan 16. I hope something changes.' 'I really loved Instagram': Kim uses the photo ap to take and share countless photos from her life . Following the outcry at the new terms, the photo-sharing app immediately moved to water down the new terms, with Mr Systrom writing a blog post addressing the issue entitled 'Thank you, and we're listening', where he said the company had heard 'loud and clear' from 'confused and upset' users. Yesterday the language that had appeared to allow Instagram advertisers to display user photos without compensation have been removed from updated terms of service. Instagram representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. Mr Systrom stressed in his latest blog post that the company had no intention of selling the photos that users post on the service. 'Going forward, rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed, we are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work,' he said.","Controversial sections of new policy reverted to their original form after massive backlash among users .

Did your weekend trip to the beach leave you feeling relaxed and refreshed?  Well now there's science that proves exactly why you got that feeling. A new study conducted at the University of Exeter found that there were numerous health benefits to spending time near the ocean. The study was presented last Wednesday at a science policy conference hosted by the American Geophysical Union. Good for you: A study presented on Wednesday by University of Exeter researchers found that living at the beach improves your health . The multi-faceted study conducted several experiments to determine whether being near a beach setting affected health. When a person goes to the beach, 'It's not going to be any great surprise to you that people relax,' said study researcher Michael White. The more complex question was how being near the beach impacted people's health. The researchers studied census data in England and found that those who lived near the coast reported better health. Better at the beach: By looking at census data, researchers found that coastal dwellers were generally healthier than inland natives - especially the lower socioeconomic groups . While one could argue that this may have something to do with wealthier people being able to afford living on the coast, the researchers actually found that it was the lower socioeconomic communities that reported the greatest health benefits. Just moving closer to the beach had an effect on people. The researchers found that moving closer to the sea 'significantly improves people's well being,' about as tenth as much as getting a new job. Moving to the sea may also reduce stress and encourage physical activity, White said. In one experiment the researchers gave study participants a set of pictures with hypothetical hotel room views, then asked how much they were willing to pay for the room. Get well: The researchers believe their results may help start a therapy program based on ocean exposure . Subjects had an option of an ocean view, green fields or cities. The results showed that the majority of the subjects would pay the most for the ocean view. The researchers are continuing to study the health benefits of seaside living. One of their ongoing studies involves putting people in stressful situations like dental surgeries and then placing them virtually in a beach setting or dental room for comparison. Early signs show that people reported feeling less pain when immersed in the seaside setting. One of the study's organizers, Lora Fleming, said their results could help create a form of therapy based on ocean exposure.","A study conducted at the University of Exeter found several piece of evidence which suggested living near the ocean is good for your health .

According to an aide, the 86-year-old Pope Emeritus has suffered from the same sense of deflation many busy people feel when they suddenly stop work. His low mood is compounded by failing health, according to Whispers in the Loggia, the Catholic gossip blog written by Vatican observer Rocco Palmo. Benedict returned to Rome yesterday to take up residence in a former convent in the Vatican gardens.

Vatican gardens. All eyes will be on Benedict's . physical state as he is welcomed by Pope Francis at his new retirement . home, a converted monastery tucked behind St. Peter's Basilica. The last time he was seen by the public - March 23 - Benedict appeared . remarkably more frail and thin than when he left the Vatican on his . final day as pope three weeks earlier. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, has acknowledged Benedict's post-retirement decline but insists the 86-year-old German isn't suffering from any ailment and is just old. 'He is a man who is not young: He is old and his strength is slowly ebbing,' Lombardi said this week. 'However, there is no special illness. He is an old man who is healthy.' Since his Febuary 28 resignation, Benedict has been 'hidden to the world' as he himself predicted, living at the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, in the hills south of Rome. Brothers arms: Pope emeritus Benedict XVI, left, is embraced by Pope Francis amid reports he is 'depressed' following his retirement from the Vatican . Sucessor: Benedict embraces his successor Pope Francis as he arrives at the Castel Gandolfo summer residence last month . Benedict's new retirement home is a converted monastery tucked behind St. Peter's Basilica. The monastery, called Mater Ecclesiae, is 4,300 square feet and lies just west of St. Peter’s Basilica. One of the nuns that lived in the . monastery told the Catholic News Agency his choice shows his 'great . simplicity' because it 'is not a work of art or comparable with other . Vatican buildings.' In the small building, with a chapel attached, Benedict will live with his personal secretary, Monsignor Georg Gaenswein. He will also live with the four consecrated women who look after him, preparing his meals and tending to the household. Inside the small building, Benedict has at his disposal a small library and a study. A guest room is available for when his brother, Monsignor Georg Ratzinger, comes to visit. According to the Spanish nun the building had not been refurbished in 18 years and needed minor repairs. 'We had humidity in the basement, the windows needed changing, and the terrace on top needed fixing and painting because of past snow,' she explained. 'But the building is very small, so they had to wait for us to leave to begin working on it.' He chose to leave the Vatican immediately after his resignation to physically remove himself from the process of electing his successor and from Pope Francis' first weeks as pontiff. His absence also gave workers time to finish up renovations on the monastery on the edge of the Vatican gardens that until last year housed groups of cloistered nuns who were invited for a few years at a time to live inside the Vatican to pray for the pontiff and church at large.

'It is certainly small but well-equipped,' Lombardi said. When Benedict announced his intention . to resign - the first pontiff to do so in 600 years - questions . immediately swirled about the implications of having two popes living . alongside one another inside the Vatican. Benedict . fueled those concerns when he chose to be called 'emeritus pope' and . 'Your Holiness' rather than 'emeritus bishop of Rome.' He also raised eyebrows when he chose to continue wearing the white cassock of the papacy. Given the political intrigues that . plague the Vatican, it wasn't much of a stretch of the imagination to . wonder if some cardinals, bishops and monsignors - not to mention . ordinary Catholics - might continue making Benedict their point of . reference rather than the new pope. However, Benedict made clear on his . final day as pope that he was renouncing the job and pledged his . 'unconditional reverence and obedience' to his then-unknown successor. It was a pledge he repeated in person on March 23 when Francis went to have lunch with him at Castel Gandolfo. It . was during that visit that the world saw how frail Benedict had become . in the three weeks since his emotional departure from the Apostolic . Palace: Always a man with a purposeful walk, he shuffled tentatively . that day, using his cane. Francis, for his part, seems utterly unfazed by the novel situation unfolding. Hidden: Since his Febuary 28 resignation, Benedict has been 'hidden to the world' as he himself predicted, living at the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, in the hills south of Rome, pictured . He has frequently invoked Benedict's name and work and has called him on a half-dozen occasions, making clear he has no intention of ignoring the fact that there's another pope still very much alive and now living on the other side of the garden from the Vatican hotel where he lives. Francis' gestures to Benedict during that March 23 visit were also remarkable: He refused to pray on the special papal kneeler in the small chapel of Castel Gandolfo, preferring to join Benedict on a kneeler in the pews, and referring to his predecessor as his 'brother.' Now that they're neighbors, they might bump into one another on walks in the Vatican gardens or at the shrine to the Madonna on the top of the hill, just a stone's throw from Benedict's new home.","Has been living at the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo since resignation .

House Speaker John Boehner issued a furious call for unity to Republicans today, telling his fractious rank and file to 'get your ass in line' behind his debt crisis plan. As public outrage continues to build over the inability of politicians to solve the nation’s debt crisis, Boehner called a closed-door meeting of the entire House Republican conference yesterday morning. 'Get your ass in line,' he told them ahead of today's vote on the bill, which was hastily rewritten to show deeper spending . cuts than 24 hours earlier. 'I can't do this job unless you're behind me.' Scroll down for video . Get in line: House Speaker John Boehner made the comments during a closed-door meeting with the entire House Republican conference . Debate: Democrat President Barack Obama, left, and Republican House Speaker John Boehner, right, have been at the forefront of negotiations to avoid the U.S. government slipping into a first-ever default next week . The House Speaker made his impassioned plea as Wall . Street suffered its worst day in eight weeks yesterday - a likely . consequence of growing anger at politicians' inability to come to any . conclusive agreement over the debt crisis. The . markets were hit again as no movement was forthcoming in talks with the . deadline for a default looming. Weak earnings and poor industrial and . technological economic data added to the concern. The . switchboard at Congress almost went down, the websites of several . Congressmen and Senators have crashed and a #F**kYouWashington Twitter . campaign has been launched. Worry: The public concern at politicians' inability to solve the debt critics so far seemed to be mirrored on Wall Street on Wednesday as stock markets begin to fall faster than earlier on in the week . The anger has mounted since President . Obama urged Americans on Monday to ask representatives to compromise on a . deal to raise the federal debt level and avoid a first-ever government . default. The Capitol switchboard sent out an alert on Tuesday and warned that the huge number of calls was putting the system ‘near capacity’, suggesting politicians start using alternative lines as a backup. The websites of Republicans House Speaker John Boehner, of Ohio, and Representative Michele Bachmann, of Minnesota, were shut down due to heavy traffic after a huge amount of emails. The #F**kYouWashington hashtag on Twitter saw up to 20,000 tweets in one hour and more than 36,000 over the course of the day, reported the New York Post. Not impressed: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, centre, who has told his fellow politicians to stop 'whining', is surrounded by Republican staffers as he walks to a meeting in Washington D.C.

Today the Dow Jones fell 199 points, or 1.6 per cent, to 12,303, the Standard & Poor's . 500 dropped 27 points, or 2 per cent, to 1,305, and the Nasdaq . composite fell 75 points, or 2.7 per cent, to 2,765. And . it’s not just the public and investors who are angry. Majority Leader . Eric Cantor urged fellow Republicans to stop ‘whining’ and back Mr . Boehner’s latest plan. ‘The debt-limit vote sucks,’ he said. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, of California, began a talk to House Republicans on Tuesday by showing a clip from 2010 Boston bank heist film 'The Town'. In the clip, Doug MacRay (played by Ben Affleck, left) tells James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner, right): 'I need your help. I can’t tell you what it is. You can never ask me about it later.' Mr Coughlin then replies: 'Whose car are we gonna take?' After the clip, Representative Allen West, of Florida, stood up and reportedly said: 'I’m ready to drive the car.' Mr Affleck has heard the news, and said in a statement: 'I don't know if this is a compliment or the ultimate repudiation. But if they're going to be watching movies, I think ""The Company Men"" is more appropriate.' But a deal still seems some way off . despite the U.S. Treasury saying without an agreement by next Tuesday it . will be unable to pay all of its bills - including debt interest . payments. The International Monetary Fund has already urged U.S. politicians to solve the crisis, and the group’s head Christine Lagarde said an ‘adverse shock’ would have knock-on effects worldwide. It seemed the fear is also spreading to the markets, as Wall Street indexes have begun to fall at a faster rate today than earlier this week. The Dow Jones industrial average opened down . 73 points, or 0.6 per cent, at 12,428 today. The Standard & Poor's 500 . Index was off 9 points, or 0.7 per cent, at 1,323, and the Nasdaq dropped 19 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 2,821. By afternoon trading, the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies had fallen 16 points, or 2 per cent, to 809. The Dow Jones lost 115 points, falling 0.9 per cent to 12,385. Standard & Poor's 500 fell 19 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,312, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 59 points, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,781. Investors are concerned that America's triple-A credit rating could be downgraded or there may be a debt default, which would raise interest rates across the board and slow down an already-stuttering U.S. economy. But many experts believe a solution will . be found before the deadline. ‘The view is that Congress will get its . act together,’ Priya Misra, of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told the . Daily Telegraph. But this calmness could be because some analysts on Wall Street actually think the deadline will be later than next Tuesday. Barclays Capital has suggested the deadline is actually on August 10. Open hands: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, accompanied by Senator Charles Schumer, of New York, takes questions as he talks about the conflicting plans to deal with the debt crisis on Wednesday . Sort it out: The International Monetary Fund has already urged U.S. politicians to solve the crisis, and the group's head Christine Lagarde said an 'adverse shock' would have knock-on effects worldwide . Democrats and Republicans have been . continuing along with their two competing plans to solve the debt crisis . with only days to come up with a compromise for raising the . $14.3trillion debt limit. The White House warned Republicans . yesterday that Mr Obama would veto Mr Boehner's debt plan which includes . a short-term debt increase of $1trillion and $1.2trillion in spending . cuts. The vote on Mr Boehner's plan was . pushed back to Thursday from Wednesday amid opposition by fellow . Republicans as well as Democrats. Republican Representative Jason . Chaffetz, of Utah, said Mr Boehner’s legislation will ‘need more drastic . cuts’ and Bill Huizenga, of Michigan, stated he is having trouble . finding ‘a path toward yes’. A separate plan crafted by Democrat Senate . Majority Leader Harry Reid also faced a setback when the non-partisan . Congressional Budget Office said the proposal would cut $2.2 trillion . from deficits. Awkward moment: President Barack Obama, right, sits next to House Speaker John Boehner, left, in the Cabinet Room of the White House last Saturday in Washington D.C. as they met to discuss the debt . This was about $500billion less than Democrats had claimed. But it wasn't the only plan criticised. Mr Boehner rushed to revise his own proposal after separate CBO analysis found it would cut spending by $350 billion less than the $1.2trillion over 10 years he had claimed. Amid the political brinkmanship, congressional leaders including Mr Boehner, Mr Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell were holding conversations on how to break the impasse. U.S. stock futures were mixed today as lawmakers remained at odds over how to avoid a default. Ahead of the opening bell, Dow Jones industrial average futures were up six, or 0.1 per cent, at 12,438.

Nuisance neighbours in Amsterdam will be exiled from the city and rehoused in 'scum villages' made up of caravans or containers under constant police supervision. Holland's capital already has a special hit squad of municipal officials to identify the worst offenders for a compulsory six month course in how to behave. Social housing problem families or tenants who do not show an improvement or refuse to go to the special units face eviction and homelessness. Problem neighbours: The mayor of Amsterdam plans to exile nuisance neighbours from the city and rehouse them in 'scum villages' Eberhard van der Laan, Amsterdam's Labour mayor, has tabled the £810,000 plan to tackle 13,000 complaints of anti-social behaviour every year. He complained that long-term harassment often leads to law abiding tenants, rather than their nuisance neighbours, being driven out, The Daily Telegraph reported. The project also involves setting up a special hotline and system for victims to report their problems to the authorities. The new punishment housing camps have been dubbed 'scum villages' because the plan echoes a proposal from Geert Wilders, the leader of a populist Dutch Right-wing party, for special units to deal with persistent troublemakers. 'Repeat offenders should be forcibly removed from their neighbourhood and sent to a village for scum,' he suggested last year. 'Put all the trash together.' Whilst denying that the new projects would be punishment camps for 'scum', a spokesman for the city mayor stressed that the special residential units would aim to enforce good behaviour. Controversial Dutch politician Geert Wilders, right, called for special units to deal with persistent troublemakers . 'The aim is not to reward people who behave badly with a new five-room home with a south-facing garden. This is supposed to be a deterrent,' he said. The tough approach taken by Mr van der Laan appears to jar with Amsterdam's famous tolerance for prostitution and soft drugs but reflects hardening attitudes to routine anti-social behaviour that falls short of criminality. Shipping container homes are already in use across Holland. Ten have been set aside for the anti-social behaviour project. Others are already used for student housing (pictured) There are already several small-scale trial projects in the Netherlands, including in Amsterdam, where 10 shipping container homes have been set aside for persistent offenders, living under 24-hour supervision from social workers and police. Under the new policy, from January next year, victims will no longer have to move to escape their tormentors, who will be moved to the new units. A team of district 'harassment directors' have already been appointed to spot signals of problems and to gather reports of nuisance tenants.","Plan echoes proposal from controversial right-wing Dutch politician Geert .

Appealing: Research has found eating salmon can reduce women's chance of breast cancer by up to 14 per cent . Women eating two helpings a week of oily fish such as salmon may gain protection against breast cancer, claim researchers. A major review of studies found adding this amount of fish to the diet cuts the breast cancer risk by up to 14 per cent. Fish supplies omega-3 fatty acids which are essential for brain development and also thought to reduce inflammation of the brain, cardiovascular system and other cells. But surveys suggest nine out of 10 children and two-thirds of adults in Britain never bother to eat it. The best dietary source of omega-3 fatty acids is oily fish because the human body cannot produce them. Almost 50,000 women in the UK develop breast cancer each year, and the rate is rising. Previous research has suggested that omega-3 is the most promising type of fat to cut cancer risk, but results have been inconsistent. A team of researchers based in China set out to investigate the link between fish and omega-3 intake and the risk of breast cancer. They measured intake from both dietary sources and blood tests, according to a report in the British Medical Journal. They reviewed and analysed the results of 26 studies from the United States, Europe and Asia involving over 800,000 participants and over 20,000 cases of breast cancer. The latest study found an extra 0.1 g or 0.1 per cent of energy per day derived from omega-3 fatty acids in fish was linked with a five per cent reduction in risk. Overall, omega-3 fatty acids from fish sources was linked with a 14 per cent cut in breast cancer between the highest and lowest levels of intake. The risk was lowest in Asian populations, probably because fish intake is much higher in Asia than in western countries, say the authors. Further analysis suggested that more protection came from eating more oily fish - an extra 0.1 g or 0.1 per cent of energy per day derived from omega-3 fatty acids in fish was linked with a five per cent reduction in risk. To achieve this level of risk reduction, women should eat one to two portions a week of oily fish such as salmon, tuna or sardines. Reduced risk: Almost 50,000 women develop breast cancer each year - but new research suggests more omega-3 in their diet can help . The authors say their analysis, together with previous publications, supports a ‘protective role’ of omega-3 fatty acids from fish on the incidence of breast cancer. They say the study provides ‘solid and robust evidence’ which could be enhanced by additional research comparing women’s omega-3 dietary intake and breast cancer incidence, it says. Britons are currently advised to eat fish at least twice a week, including one portion of oily fish. A portion is 140g or six ounces. The human body cannot produce omega-3 fatty acids and the best dietary source is oily fish. Types of fish that contain high levels include tuna, salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, and anchovies. White fish is also a healthy food including cod, haddock and plaice although it contains lower levels of essential fatty acids. Katherine Woods, Research Information Manager at Breast Cancer Campaign said the research may have failed to account for women with healthier diets being leaner. She said ‘While this research reported a reduction in breast cancer risk of 14 per cent for women consuming the highest levels of a particular type of fatty acid, it is important to note that body mass index (BMI) was not factored into the findings which could go some way to explaining this link. ‘Further research is needed in order to understand any links between BMI, fatty acids found in fish and breast cancer risk. ‘Maintaining a healthy weight, exercise and reducing alcohol intake can help reduce the risk of breast cancer and other diseases.’ Sally Greenbrook, Breakthrough Breast Cancer’s Senior Policy Officer said ‘It’s difficult to say with any certainty which foods or dietary factors have an impact on breast cancer risk, since we all eat a variety of different foods, and our diet changes over our lifetime. ‘The study found that fatty acids found in fish could be associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, but there’s not enough evidence yet to suggest eating fish will reduce a person’s individual risk. However, we do recommend that all people eat a healthy balanced diet for their general health and wellbeing, of which fish can certainly form a part.’","Omega-3 fatty acids can cut breast cancer risk by up to 14 per cent .

And it seems that men are now so desperate to emulate David Beckham's groomed look that they are even resorting to stealing their partner's beauty products to do so. Britain’s metrosexual males are using £234 worth of their girlfriends’ and wives’ designer skin-care products every year in a bid to be like Becks. The Becks effect: 46.4 per cent of British women said their men are pampering themselves pretty much on a daily basis with their beauty products to look like David Beckham . Nearly half of British women revealed that the man in their life is sneakily using their beauty products on a weekly basis – and they estimated that it costs them £19.50 a month on average. In the past few years famous metrosexual men like David have changed perceptions on male grooming and now it’s much more acceptable for men to cleanse, tone and moisturise. But in the new survey, 46.4 per cent of British women said their men are pampering themselves pretty much on a daily basis with their beauty products. Groomed guys: In the past few years metrosexual men like David have changed perceptions on male grooming and now it's much more acceptable for men to moisturise . Most women (67.9 per cent) said their boyfriend or husband would regularly use day and night moisturiser– and over one in five said he would try to use their products sneakily when they weren’t looking. By far the biggest gripe for women was that the metrosexual man in their life would turn his nose up at their cheaper products - 42.9 per cent of women said their man would always choose to use their most expensive skincare products. And when they used the expensive lotions, 25 per cent said their man would be far too liberal with it. This choice of designer skincare products was beginning to cost them around half of their monthly beauty spend of £39 because, in many cases, their boyfriend was using just as much of the skincare products as they were. A spokesman for CEO of Escentual.com, who carried out the research, said: 'Twenty years ago most men wouldn’t have dreamed of using a moisturiser but nowadays it is much more common-place thanks to role models like David Beckham. 'But it’s clear that many men still haven’t got into the habit of actually buying their own beauty products and tend to use their partner’s moisturiser instead. 'What is especially cheeky is that the men generally turned their nose up at cheaper high-street moisturisers and only want to use their girlfriend’s more expensive premium brands like Clarins and Avene.' Of the British wives and girlfriends questioned, they said the main reason that men weren’t buying their own products was because they hated shopping. Pampered: Men also love the most expensive lotions and 25 per cent of women said their man would use far too much on their face . Nearly 40 per cent said their boyfriend couldn’t be bothered to look around the shops to get their own skincare products, and a further 21 per cent said that he would be too embarrassed to buy moisturiser in a high-street shop and would hate his male friends to know that he buys beauty products. The spokesman added: 'Clearly there is still some stigma attached for men to buy beauty products in public, but mainly it’s because guys hate going shopping. 'This is why we have seen a marked increase for men buying skin-care products online because that way they can avoid feeling awkward in a shop.' 1. Clarins Extra Firming Day Cream2.

Wrongly accused: José García has been extradited from Texas to Miami twice for crimes he did not commit 30 years ago because he shares the same name and birth date as the accused . A Texas truck driver has been arrested and tried TWICE for a crime he did not commit because he shares the same name and birth date as the wanted man. José García has been extradited on both occasions from his home in the southern state to a jail cell in Miami, where he has been locked up before eventually facing a judge. Mr García, who lost his job in both incidences, is now trying to recover his losses and is outraged that the police and the judiciary could make the same mistake twice. Speaking to the Miami Herald, he said: 'It shouldn't happen twice; it shouldn't even happen at all - never, ever.' While Mr García's criminal record is not exactly spotless, it was his previous conviction for a rape charge which was evidence that he did  not commit an armed robbery and kidnapping 30 years ago. At the time of the alleged crime, which took place in Kendall, Florida on Christmas Day in 1983, Mr García was serving a six-year jail term for his sex crime. But in 2008, the truck driver was picked up by police at his Texas home, and flown to South Florida, where he spent two months in jail. He eventually proved his innocence with his previous prison record, and the courts let Mr García walk free. Having lost his job once for a crime he did not commit, Mr García was shocked to be arrested and extradited a second time for the same crime. Local police in Texas, in southern Cameron County, found an old arrest warrant for Mr García from before his 2008 case, and contacted Miami-Dade Police Department. Since back then they thought this was the man they were looking for, the mug-shot, finger prints as well as name and date of birth all matched the old warrant. Texas police looked into Mr García's file while he was serving a five-day sentence for drink driving. After he finished serving his driving while intoxicated (DWI) jail term, he was sent back to his prison cell - for another month - to await extradition back to Florida. Flabbergasted he was being arrested again for the same kidnapping case, Mr García told them: 'You're the ones kidnapping me.' After . showing the Texas police officers his court order from 2008 proving his . innocence, he told the US paper: 'They just looked at each other. They . told me there was nothing they could do.' Evidence: Footage from the court video shows how Mr Garcia, holding out his court order letter, explained to the Miami judge that his was not the man they were looking for. The judge appeared baffled . After a month being held in the Texas cell, officers from Miami came to fly him handcuffed to Florida, to face another judge the next day. When he was brought before the court, Mr García once again presented his court order as evidence of his innocence. A baffled judge questioned the situation with Mr García's attorney before ordering his release. The police in Florida claimed the truck driver 'failed to inform anyone that this was a case of mistaken identity' - something refuted by Mr García. Law enforcement authorities in Texas said he presented them with the evidence, but Miami-Dade Police Department said they still wanted him arrested. Katherine Fernandez Rundle, Miami-Dade State Attorney told the paper: 'If an innocent person is charged with a crime, a guilty person walks free. Neither situation should ever happen.' Hopefully, now, however, Mr García will never again face the courts for the same crime, after the police placed an alert against his name, locally and nationally, indicating that he is not the man wanted for the 1983 kidnapping.","José García, from Texas, cleared his name of the kidnapping in 2008 after being wrongly accused of the 1983 attack .

High fashion to high street: Kate Moss, pictured in Versace's F/W campaign, has a less glamorous business deal in the pipeline . She has landed campaigns with some of the world’s most glamorous brands. But Kate Moss’s latest career move is a bit more down to earth – the supermodel is now the face of high street phone-seller Carphone Warehouse. Miss Moss, who has posed for exclusive designers including Chanel and Burberry, is working on a range of smartphone cases for an undisclosed fee. The collection, due to launch later in the summer, will ‘apply Kate’s sensibility to the latest handsets’, the retailer said last night. The company recruited the 39-year-old model in a bid to cash in on what it calls ‘fashion tech’ – or phone accessories aimed at customers who ‘are crying out’ for something more stylish than cheap plastic cases. For Moss, it may lack the glamour of strutting the catwalks in Paris or Milan, but Carphone believes adding her touch to the humble phone case will tempt female customers who see her as a style icon. The company has recruited the 39-year-old Croydon born model in a bid to cash in on what it calls ‘fashion tech’, or phone accessories aimed at customers who ‘are crying out for something different’ from cheap plastic cases. Carphone added that the cases will be ‘unique designs’ made out of leather and with charms attached, in her ‘personal style’, . Moss and husband Jamie Hince both sported gold charm necklaces at Glastonbury this weekend, along with his-and-hers black jeans and wellies. Julian Diment, marketing director, said Moss’s designs are inspired by her ‘favourite things’, adding: ‘She has been integral to the design process, raiding her jewellery box for inspiration on the charms.’ The company declined to disclose any details on how much the cases will cost, or on Moss’s fee. The collaboration with Carphone Warehouse is more down-to-earth than  the glossy campaigns once associated with Moss. She  has seen several upmarket contracts go to younger women in recent years, including  perfume advertising for YSL Parisienne and Dior Addict. New venture: Kate Moss will be designing smartphone cases for high street dealers Carphone Warehouse . A lucrative four year partnership with Sir Philip Green at Topshop, reported to have earned her more than £3million, ended in 2010. She no longer acts as the face of Mango, the Spanish clothing chain, with Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr, a decade younger, starring in its latest campaign. Although still a very high earner, Moss’s income appears to have been falling. According to an estimate of her wealth in American business magazine in Forbes last summer, she earned £6.3million in the previous 12 months, compared with £8.9m in 2010/11. Moss said: ‘My phone’s as much a part of my look as my bag or shoes, and yet there’s so little choice out there.’",Kate is designing smartphone cases for Carphone Warehouse .

The family of a terrified motorist who called police to say he was being followed by a gunman and was then found shot dead by the side of a road is calling for answers to his tragic killing. Police dispatchers were on the phone with Fred William Turner Jr, pictured for the first time today, when he was shot dead on Saturday afternoon. The 47-year-old Orlando man's body was found slumped over the wheel of his car on I-4 outside of Tampa, Florida. One theory is that he was the victim of a violent road rage attack. Fred Turner's ex-wife, . who is among his closest family, says he was a reserved, quiet man and . says she cannot imagine anyone wanting to hurt him. She told 10 News off-camera she hopes someone will come forward with information leading to his killer. One of Turner's neighbours in Orlando, who wished to remain anonymous, says he did not know why anyone would want to kill him. 'He was a nice guy. I don't see him having any enemies.' Followed: 47-year-old Fred William Turner Jr of Orlando called 911 to report someone following him after leaving a store . Unprovoked: He told dispatchers he was on the interstate heading towards Orlando. While on the phone with police, Turner said the car following him pulled up beside him, and someone inside displayed what appeared to be a semi-automatic weapon . 'He stayed to himself. He was a quiet guy. I just can't believe that someone would just openly, randomly shoot him on I-4. That's horrible.' Investigators are piecing together 911 calls, but a missing piece of the puzzle is tips from drivers who may have been in the area around 3pm on Saturday. His death bears a chilling similarity to that of David Neel, who was shot dead in 2005 in the same area. Neel was shot and killed on March 6, 2005 on Interstate 75, while he was heading to the Strawberry Festival in Plant City. He was killed after someone shot through the driver's side door of his Ford F-250. Busy route: The shooting happened on the eastbound lanes I-4 heading towards Orlando . Fatal: As Tuner approached the I-75 overpass, shots rang out and he was hit, authorities said . Neel's killing remains unsolved. Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee said the latest killing took place within a few hundred yards of the 2005 attack. Police and state troopers have launched a manhunt for the man who shot Turner Jr and searched the murder scene for clues. The killing about 3pm on Saturday shut down the eastbound section of I-4 for almost eight hours. Police said Turner called a 911 dispatcher that a man pulled up alongside his car, rolled down a window and brandished a semi-automatic handgun. Turner told the dispatcher he did not recognise the man or why he was following him. Police said Turner stayed on the phone with the 911 dispatcher, but as he drove on to the I-4 heading towards Orlando, shots rang out. Turner pulled his car off the road and died at the scene. Possible road rage attack: Law enforcement officials in the area are looking for a gray, newer model Ford Taurus with tinted windows . 'While on the phone, the caller stated that the vehicle following him had earlier pulled up next to his vehicle and someone displayed what appeared to be a semiautomatic weapon to him,' said Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Debbie Carter said. 'At some point, for unknown reasons, the occupant, or occupants, of one vehicle fired multiple shots at the other vehicle.' Law enforcement officials in the area are looking for a gray, newer model Ford Taurus with tinted windows. 'The caller stated that he had done nothing to cause someone to follow him,' Carter said. Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee said the case looks to be road rage, but added that witnesses are still being interviewed and detectives are working to determine exactly what happened leading up the shooting. 'We're going to have to reconstruct that from the 911 tapes,' Gee said, 'but we know that we have the shooting apparently on the tape.'","Fred William Turner Jr was killed in his car while driving on the 1-4 outside of Tampa, Florida .

Still rocking: Mick Jagger, seen performing in Los Angeles in April, mused about what could have been . He drove teenage girls wild, sold millions of albums and fronts one of the world's most popular bands. But it would seem that Sir Mick Jagger can't get no Satisfaction - and wishes he could have had a 'gratifying' tole as a teacher, instead of the 'intellectually undemanding' life of a rocker. The Rolling Stone frontman, who has earned millions from his singing career, says that the life of a teacher, journalist or politician would have been a worthy way of earning a living. In an interview on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, the veteran rocker said he had considered a career as a dancer but was put off by the prospect of 'so many injuries'. Jagger, who was still a student at the London School of Economics when the Stones were starting out in the Sixties, told John Humphrys: 'A schoolteacher would have been very gratifying, I'm sure. 'Everyone wants to have done more things in their lives. 'It is a slightly intellectually undemanding thing to do, being a rock singer, but, you know, you make the best of it.' The 69-year-old OBE mused about his lengthy career as he and his band prepared to perform at Glastonbury this weekend. Life could have been very different for . the father-of-seven if he had pursued a more academic career. He began playing gigs in London in 1962 and is . estimated to have sold more than 200million albums. The rocker said he had considered a career as a dancer but was put off by the prospect of 'so many injuries' The musician, from Dartford, Kent, attended grammar school and said there were a 'million things' he would have liked to have pursued. Jagger was still a student at the London School of Economics when the Stones were starting out . He said in the interview: 'All these things you think of when you're a teenager, you can think, well, I would have liked to have done that but that's completely pointless but I don't feel frustrated for a lack of control at all and I'm very pleased with what I've done,' The Telegraph reported. But despite sacrificing a more challenging role in life, it would appear that the rocker is still studious when it comes to his art. The Rolling Stones may be one of the biggest acts in the world but Jagger still took his preparations for the Glastonbury festival extremely seriously. The singer studied DVDs of performances of the festival going back over the last four years to prepare for the band’s much-awaited headlining slot this weekend.

PR firm, has written a guide on how to win people over in disputes called 'What to Say When Things Get Tough' Greenberger told WBAL that hostile conversations are unique in that the 'normal rules of communication got out the window.' If you want to get your point heard and accepted in these situations you need to prove that you are trustworthy and credible. Greenberger says you have to demonstrate four things: that your caring, open, honest and an expert. What to say when things get tough: The new book by Leonard Greenberger explains how to get your voice heard in hostile converations . Expert: Greenberger has had to deal with a lot of uncomfortable situations as a partner at a Washington, D.C. PR firm . A good way of going about this is by telling stories that people can relate to. Greenberger uses the example of David Axelrod, President Obama's former senior adviser. One morning, Greenberger heard Axelrod talking about healthcare reform on a Sunday talk show. Axelroad shared a personal story about how his own daughter was born with epilepsy and how he and his wife always worried about how they were going to be able to afford her healthcare. With the Obamacare, that's not something they would have to worry about as much anymore. That personal story was something that Greenberger could relate to since he has a daughter of his own. 'He made me a fan of his and also a bigger fan of the healthcare legislation,' Greenberger said. Get your point across: In order to prove that you are trustworthy and credible you must demonstrate that you are caring, open, honest and an expert . But more important than what you say is what you do. Physical actions are three times more important in terms of establishing trust and credibility, Greenberger says. Pay attention to everything you're doing, make good eye contact, and keep your hands out. Don't  put them behind your back or in your pockets or cross your arms. 'All of those send negative signals to people who are worried, angry or suspicious of what you're saying - you are a dishonest person,' he said. And like most situations, it's good to keep a positive attitude. Greenberger says that people will often go into hostile situation with a defensive crouch because they're worried. 'People might be angry or upset, but you need to be positive,' he says. 'You have a good story to tell and that's your job.' Keep calm: Whatever you do, don't fidget. Movements like breaking eye contact and folding your arms send negative signs to the person you're trying to communicate with and will have them writing you off .","A Washington, D.C.

A privately-owned sightseeing helicopter went down in the Hudson River on Sunday but the young pilot's skilled emergency landing left no one injured. Michael Campbell, 22, had only been on the job for a year when he made the miraculous emergency landing, The New York Daily News reported. None of the copter's four passengers, including two children, were hurt. 'I was just doing my job. I did what I had to do,' Campbell said. Rescue: A helicopter rests on a pontoon at the 79th Street Boat Basin after an emergency landing over the Hudson river in New York on June 30 . Pilot: The helicopter's pilot, Michael Campbell, 22, left, made a 'skilled' emergency landing into the Hudson River . Massive operation: As it descended, Campbell released the helicopter's yellow floaters . Campbell took off just before noon Sunday with four Swedish tourists on board. The helicopter's engine lost power, forcing Campbell to act quickly. 'The pilot did a terrific job, considering he lost his engine power,' FDNY Deputy Fire Chief Thomas McKavanagh told reporters. Campbell brought the copter down near the 79th Street Boat basin. 'He had some kind of control—a very skilled pilot,' McKavanagh said. Stefan Capan, who was riding his bike along the river path at the time, told the Gothamist: 'We were sitting north of the Boat Basin . Marina when I saw the helicopter approaching north, going very fast and . losing altitude very quickly.' Close to disaster: The helicopter made the emergency landing around noon on Sunday . Omar Vidal, 22, a waiter at the Boat Basin Cafe near where the emergency landing occurred, told the Daily News he heard the copter 'going down really fast'. He said the pilot 'popped out the floaters' as before crashing into the river with a huge splash. 'We couldn’t see it for two seconds because of the splash. Everybody was looking, like, ""What just happened?""' he said.  'The helicopter vanished into the splash.' After the copter popped back up, several bystanders assisted in the rescue. Luck escape: All five people who were in the helicopter managed to survive the crash uninjured . Hero: Sebastien Berthelet, from Montreal, right, helped bring to shore the pilot who made an emergency landing of his helicopter, as well as four passengers . Sebastian Berthelet 38, and stepson Lambert De Monte, 16, or Montreal, took a dingy from their nearby sailboat to help. 'In the beginning we thought it was an exercise, just a helicopter trying to land in the water,' Berthelet told the New York Post. 'When we saw the floaters we thought maybe that's just practice. But when it hit the water, it hit hard.' 'Let's go, let's go, let's see if we can help,' Berthelet said his stepson said. They brought the pilot into their dingy and Berthelet said Campbell was 'in shock'. After complimenting Campbell on his landing, the pilot responded: 'It could have been smoother.' Berthelet said the pilot was the real hero. 'We are not,'he said. 'He's the guy who saved the lives.' Dramatic landing: The privately-owned helicopter was pulled into a marina following its emergency landing in the Hudson on Sunday . There were no injuries reported but all of those on board were being checked out at the 79th Street Boat Basin. The helicopter was towed in and removed by authorities. 'I would say it sustained some kind of impact onto the water,' McKavanagh told the Daily News. 'They would have to look at it to see if the helicopter needs any kind of repairs. I'm sure it needs at least an engine.' Campbell's uncle told the Daily News he has always wanted to be a helicopter pilot and that he 'loves' flying. His grandmother said was 'proud' of his landing. 'Somebody was watching over him to keep him safe and the tourists with him safe,' Mary Ann Campbell, 68, told the Daily News.

The festival's organiser Michael Eavis said today he had chatted with the prince last night and recommended he stayed to sample the nightlife. Harry's on-off girlfriend Cressida Bonas was pictured enjoying the sunshine at the Worthy Farm site in Somerset yesterday, but the prince managed to evade photographers as he partied the night away. Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas was spotted buying food at the festival before he joined her backstage . Harry, pictured at a wedding last weekend, met up with girlfriend Cressida (right) at the festival . The Prince watched the Rolling Stones headline the Pyramid Stage from behind the scenese . The Stones went down well with the 100,000-strong crowd at Glastonbury Festival . The festival is notorious for poor weather and seas of mud but the sun beamed down on the Somerset site yesterday . Mr Eavis said Harry had watched the Rolling Stones headline the Pyramid Stage last night and also enjoyed music at the Park and John Peel stages. The 77-year-old farmer said: 'Prince Harry was great actually. I recommended that he should go on into the night, because the nightlife is what Glastonbury is all about. At three o'clock in the afternoon, you don't get it. 'I . told him to get his taxi driver to come back at five o'clock in the . morning and do you know what? He lasted until four in the morning. Organiser Michael Eavis said Prince Harry was 'great' and stayed out until 4am . 'His friends were all having a great time. He didn't want to make a formal thing of being here.' The UK's biggest music festival has . attracted celebrities including Kate Moss, Wayne and Colleen Rooney and . Katherine Jenkins over the weekend. Backstage today, actress Sienna Miller, singer Florence Welch and presenter Dermot O'Leary were spotted. Mr Eavis said he did not join Harry for a pint of cider as he abstains from drinking from two months before the festival until after everyone has left the site. He added that the Rolling Stones had been the festival's best-ever headline set and that their two-hour performance - complete with fireworks and a burning phoenix on top of the stage - was worth the wait. He had tried to secure the band, celebrating their 50th anniversary, for years and said he was not sure how next year's headliners, who have already been booked, would live up to the Stones. 'It was 43 years in the making, 50 years for them, and we've finally come together. We're on the same page at last,' Eavis said, on the third day of music at the festival. He said: 'It's the whole razzmatazz of the occasion - the two of us finally getting together at long last. 'I had to prove myself to them. We were a bunch of hippies; it's hardly a Rolling Stones set up, is it?' The capacity of the Pyramid area was expanded for the first time for the Stones, meaning a festival record of 100,000 people saw Sir Mick Jagger strutting his stuff. He led the band through their classics, starting with an energetic Jumpin' Jack Flash and ending with a soulful You Can't Always Get What You Want, before crowd-pleaser Satisfaction. Jagger was said to have been concerned about sound quality ahead of the gig, but his fears were unfounded. 'Musically, they were absolutely brilliant,' said Eavis, who claimed the band were number one in his top 10 of headliners, above Radiohead, U2 and Oasis. 'Mick Jagger's energy leading that band with such a passion and so much style - he was absolutely amazing. The crowds at Worthy Farm, in Somerset, made the most of the good weather . Although Harry was able to sneak in to the festival unnoticed these Royal fans made sure the 'Queen' was easily spotted . Festival-goers soaked up the sunshine at the Pyramid stage yesterday . 'I've never seen anything like it. It's quite remarkable to think he can go like that, at his age. 'I'm a bit older and I couldn't keep going. His legs and his arms and his movement - he was going for it like his life depended on it.' The mechanical phoenix created by Joe Rush, which came to life during Sympathy For The Devil, was a labour of love, with health and safety officials voicing concerns, Eavis said. He laughed as he claimed the ornate moving sculpture had cost almost the same as the Stones' fee for their set. Bands have already been booked for next year's key Pyramid stage headline slots. Asked if there were any veteran rockers on a par with the Stones, Eavis smiled and said: 'Ever so slightly, yeah.' He joked that there were now very few acts left on his wish list, and pondering how many more festivals he will organise, said: 'Another 10, do you think?'. He said the ticket holders, of which there were 135,000 this year, were what kept him going. A BBC Two spokesman said its coverage of The Rolling Stones peaked at 2.5 million viewers, compared to the peak of 2.1 million for U2 who headlined on the Saturday night at the last Glastonbury festival in 2011. Revellers stayed up until dawn to watch the sun rise over the stone circle at the festival . The party atmosphere continued right through the night until dawn. Festival organiser Michael Eavis said the nightlife was the best part . One group huddled together for a nap as they waited for the sun to rise . Other highlights of the weekend have . included Friday night's headline set from the Arctic Monkeys, Portishead . on the Other Stage and an early morning performance from Liam .

'It . fills me with so much confidence because people love it so much,' he . said. 'The people are so thrilled to be here. So that's my energy, . really.' Police said crime at this year's Glastonbury Festival has dropped dramatically from the last time the event was staged. Huge amounts of litter left over from the previous night's entertainment at the Other Stage awaits cleaners . A group of festival-goers, including one dressed as superman, makes their way through the rubbish back to their tents as dawn breaks .

Those crimes included 61 drug offences and 106 thefts from tents. There were no major incidents on site and a total of 154 arrests have been made. Inspector Shirley Eden said: 'We are very pleased with how the festival has gone. It's been a fantastic event, the atmosphere has been brilliant and crime is low.

Following on from the discovery of the remains of King Richard III buried deep under a car park in the city, the team which worked on that astonishing find has discovered another gem - under another car park. Experts from the University of Leicester archaeological unit that unearthed the last Plantagenet king, spearheaded another dig and discovered a 1,700-year-old Roman cemetery with remains thought to date back to 300AD. Archaeologists have found 13 burials, belt buckles, a ring bearing a possible Christian symbol and people with different beliefs were buried alongside each other . A ring bearing a possible early Christian symbol, found by archaeologists at the site. Experts believe it may show an IX (Iota-Chi) monogram taken from the initials of Jesus Christ in Greek . Researchers found 13 sets of remains of mixed age and sex, and discovered the unusual practice of Christian burials alongside pagan burials. Personal items such as hairpins and belt buckles, remains of shoes, and a ring bearing a possible early Christian symbol were also found at the Oxford Street site in Leicester’s historic city centre. In addition, the team has found a jet ring with a 'curious' symbol etched on it, apparently showing the letters IX overlain. Opinion as to its meaning is divided; researchers said it may just be an attractive design but it is also reminiscent of an early Christian symbol known as an IX (Iota-Chi) monogram taken from the initials of Jesus Christ in Greek. Archaeological project officer John Thomas said: 'We have discovered new evidence about a known cemetery that existed outside the walled town of Roman Leicester during the 3rd to 4th Centuries AD. 'The excavation, at the junction of Oxford Street and Newarke Street, lay approximately 130m outside the south gate of Roman Leicester, adjacent to one of the main routes into the town from the south (Oxford Street). The site of newly-discovered Roman burials under excavation below a car park in Leicester . 'Roman law forbade burial within the town limits so cemeteries developed outside the walls, close to well-used roads. 'Previous excavations on Newarke Street had discovered numerous burials to the immediate east and north of the present site, all of which appeared to have been buried according to Christian traditions - buried in a supine position, facing east with little or no grave goods. 'Unusually, the 13 burials found during the recent excavations, of mixed age and sex, displayed a variety of burial traditions including east to west and north to south-oriented graves, many with personal items such as finger rings, hairpins, buckles and hob-nailed shoes.' Researchers have so far found 13 burials, belt buckles, a ring bearing a possible Christian symbol, and found people with different beliefs were buried alongside each other . Mr Thomas said the jet ring was found on a set of remains that were buried in a Christian tradition - facing east - and nearby was a grave that showed a possible Pagan burial. This grave had a north-south orientation, he said, with the body laid on its side in a semi-foetal position, with the head removed and placed near the feet alongside two complete pottery jars that would have held offerings for the journey to the afterlife. He added: 'This would seem to be a very pagan burial, so it is possible from the variety of burials found that the cemetery catered for a range of beliefs that would have been important to people living in Leicester at this time.' Researchers said the excavations also added information to the increasingly well documented medieval southern suburb of the town, revealing remains of 12th to 13th century quarries, cesspits and rubbish pits that would have been dug in the backyards of properties fronting onto Oxford Street. Mr Thomas added: 'All of these pits contained a wealth of information from pottery, bone and environmental remains to help build a picture of medieval life in this part of the town. A large 17th century defensive ditch running alongside Newarke Street was also discovered which was part of the town’s defences during the English Civil War.' The site is earmarked for development. To great fanfare and cheers, scientists earlier this year announced to the world that the skeleton found under a council car park in Leicester is that of Richard III. It was, they said, a historic moment, finally ending the centuries-old mystery of what happened to the body of the last Plantagenet king. But the best was to come. Academics were also able to reveal details of how one of the nation’s most controversial monarchs met his end – and how appallingly he was treated in death after defeat at the hands of Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Stripped naked with his hands tied, and scarred by multiple ‘humiliation wounds’ inflicted as his body was paraded through Leicester, Richard III was dumped in a shallow grave with no coffin or shroud. There his body remained until his skeleton was discovered last year following a campaign led by Phillipa Langley, of the Richard III Society.

Criminal charges against a man whose homemade wristwatch triggered a full-on terror scare at a California airport last week will not be pressed prosecutors have announced. The watch described having a toggle switch, fuses, and wires while running on a timer led to Geoffrey McGann's arrest on Thursday after he presented it to security at the Oakland International Airport. The 49-year-old artist from outside Los Angeles, defended the unique timepiece as having been a harmless work of art. Not a threat: Charges against a California man arrested for wearing this homemade wristwatch mistaken for a bomb will not be pursued according to prosecutors . Motive: Geoffrey McGann, who was arrested at the Oakland International Airport on Thursday, told officers he's an artist and the watch was a part of his art . McGann was instead charged of possessing materials to make an explosive device. He was released on Saturday after posting $150,000 bail . 'The watch had on it a toggle switch, a series of fuses, a series of wires protruding from it, a circuit board and the watch itself was on a direct timer,' Alameda County Sheriff's Sergeant J.D. Nelson said at the time of his arrest on Thursday. TSA agents said they became suspicious of McGann when he tried to get the object through airport security by putting it in a bin covered by his jacked. Sgt Nelson said that was just one of many irregularities which led officers to be disturbed by his demeanour and attire. 'He was wearing a military style shirt that has a built-in tourniquet in the sleeves,' he said. McGannwas also wearing shoes two sizes too big and packed with layers of insoles - an eery similarity to the explosive device worn by the 2001 shoe bomber, Richard Reid. Suspicious: TSA agents reported McGann placing the wrist watch in a security bin before suspiciously covering it with a jacket that revealed his military-style shirt with a built-in tourniquet in the sleeves . Eerie similarities: In addition to his suspicious watch McGann was found wearing shoes two-sizes too big that were stuffed with shoe insoles, much like the 2001 shoe bomber Richard Reid . Free to go: McGann, a managing creative director according to his Facebook profile, was released after posting $150,000 bail on Saturday . 'They also had what appeared to be a homemade cavity in them and he was very evasive on everything that he was doing,'  Nelson said. The official said the bomb squad arrived within five minutes and determined there were no explosive materials in the watch. 'Obviously he was missing a couple of things along the way,' Nelson admitted, while insisting police regarded the watch as a possible 'triggering device.' According to McGann's Facebook page he is managing creative director of a media, marketing and advertising group, having studied visual communication design in college. He is also a father to a little girl. Asked at the time if the sheriff's department had any idea of a possible motive for smuggling the device onboard, Nelson suggested it was possible McGann was testing out airport security systems in preparation for a full-blown attack at a later date. 'That's always a concern that someone is making a dry run,' he said.","Police say homemade watch was on direct timer with fuses, wires and circuit board .

Wendy Davis responded to Gov. Rick Perry's personal criticism of her action, saying the Republican governor 'demeaned' his office with the comments. 'I didn't have an angry response to it on behalf of myself, I think it just demonstrated the typical attitude that governor Perry has expressed toward this issue,' Davis said on CNN Friday. Earlier last week, Davis filibustered a legislation that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks and establish new regulations on providers of abortions, limiting the amount to just five. Standing her ground: Texas state Senator Wendy Davis responds to comments Gov. Rick Perry made about her filibuster of a severe abortion bill . Conference: At an anti-abortion conference after Davis' filibuster, Texas Gov. Rick Perry questioned if the state senator had learned the right lesson about the issue from her own background . After the successful action, Perry spoke at a national 'Right to Life' conference noting Davis' personal history did not affect her stance on abortion. 'The fact is, who are we to say that children born into the worst of circumstances can't grow to live successful lives?' Perry had said. 'In fact, even the woman who filibustered the Senate the other day was born into difficult circumstances. 'She was the daughter of a single woman. She was a teenage mother herself. She managed to eventually graduate from Harvard Law School and serve in the Texas senate,' Perry continued. 'It's just unfortunate that she hasn't learned from her own example that every life must be given a chance to realize its full potential and that every life matters.' 'Right to Life': Speaking at the conference, Perry asked, 'who are we to say that children born into the worst of circumstances can't grow to live successful lives?', noting Davis' background . Marathon: Perry made the comments after Davis filibustered an abortion bill for 11 hours, ultimately causing its demise until a special session . Davis told Wolf Blitzer said that the comments were 'symptomatic' of Perry's perspective on women's rights. She said the governor has desire to 'see big government intrude upon those very private matters'. Blitzer noted Perry was invited to join Davis on the program but did not come on. He asked Davis what she would say directly to Perry about his remarks. 'Governor Perry, if you truly care about women's health, let's do something to make sure that we're protecting them,' Davis said. 'Let's make sure we're preventing unplanned pregnancies and that we're committing resources to make that happen.' She asked Perry to work for 'age appropriate' sex education in the Texas school system. Criticism: In response to Perry's comments, Davis, right, said the governor, left, has 'demeaned' his office and represented his 'typical attitude' 'And let's stop demonizing women who face very difficult choices in their life,' Davis said. 'Let's make sure we don't close down 37 of the 42 clinics in Texas and leave women with no where to go and put them in a situation where their health will be at risk.' Davis cited the American College of Gynecology and Obstetrics' qualms with the bill, which was also opposed by The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, according to Salon. 'They believe it endangers women's health because it's putting us back in an era that we've been before,' Davis said.'And we know what happens when women in impoverished settings who can't access care turn to.' Counter: In her response to Perry, Davis, pictured at center voting 'no' to the bill, asked for the governor and other politicians to 'stop demonizing women' Davis also said that Perry—and other lawmakers—'do know' closing abortion clinics doesn't stop them from occurring. In explaining his actions, Perry's office told CNN he was 'praising Sen. Davis for her success despite coming from difficult circumstances, and that should be an inspiration to others'.After her filibuster of the bill, Davis come into the national spotlight this week. She was praised by pro-abortion advocates and hundreds of protestors filled the Capitol building during her filibuster Tuesday. Protest: Hundreds of abortion rights activists came to the Capitol building to cheer on Davis during the filibuster . While Davis meant to monopolize the final 13 hours of the Texas legislature's session, she was interrupted after 10 hours and 45 minutes by Republican colleagues who said she violated the rules by going off-topic and using a back brace to keep her standing. Republicans tried to finish the vote before midnight—seemingly attempting to edit records when they were unable to do so—but the bill was eventually deemed dead.Perry called for a special session Monday in order to pass the bill, but Davis told The Huffington Post she still has hope it won't pass in the Republican-dominated legislature.'I think that there are certainly some members across the aisle that are giving this a second thought,' Davis said. 'And I wouldn't attribute that necessarily to anything I said or did. But the reaction that they're seeing—the very organic reaction that they're seeing from across the state of Texas, I think it's giving some people pause, as it should.'","Texas state Sen.

Curious pooch: Just as the leading cyclists neared the finish in the second stage of the Tour de France, a tiny white dog got free from his owner . Gap: The dog went into the middle of the course in between the leading riders and the chasing pack . The dog remained on the road for a few seconds before, seemingly satisfied, he started to return to the sidelines. But when its owner rushed to get him, the petite pooch jumped back, startled. Rescue attempt: Just as the dog's owner, top middle in blue, tried to retrieve him, the pooch was startled back into the course . Abandon: To avoid getting hit himself, the canine's owner retreated when a group of 100 riders approached . But that's when a huge group of cyclists came round the bend.

Princess Alexandra, the Queen’s cousin, has cancelled all her public appointments indefinitely due to ill-health. The 76-year-old sister of the Duke of Kent, who carried out 110 engagements in 2012, has not been seen in public this year, including being absent from the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s Coronation. The Princess is suffering from a form of arthritis that leads to stiffness in the joints and in some cases blindness, raising concerns about her ability to perform her Royal duties. She is understood to be taking steroids to control the condition, but they can cause side effects including thinning of the bones and causing sufferers to develop a puffy or ‘moon’ face. Buckingham Palace announced in April that the Princess, who is 42nd in line to the Throne, was being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica, and now a Palace spokeswoman has told The Mail on Sunday there are no plans for the Princess to carry out duties ‘for the foreseeable future’. Her last engagement was  on December 20 when she attended a service to mark the 600th anniversary of the University of St Andrews at St Paul’s Cathedral. The Princess, a granddaughter of King George V who lives in a Royal residence in Richmond Park, South-West London, is said to be ‘in good spirits’ but doctors have ordered her to rest. She trained at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and is patron of various charities. The Princess is said to be  keen to return to work, but her office staff have not yet been told when they can start organising her diary again.

A Palace spokeswoman said last night: ‘Her Royal Highness had a viral infection at the end of last year and was advised to rest. We do not know when she will next appear in public.’ In 1989, the Princess had a public row with her rebellious daughter Marina, who, when pregnant, claimed her parents insisted that she either had an abortion or a shotgun wedding. Marina subsequently married fashion photographer Paul Mowatt before the birth of their daughter. But there was a reconciliation after 2003 reports that Marina was living on benefits after her marriage collapsed. Princess Alexandra’s husband, Sir Angus Ogilvy, died in 2004.

But instead there were just police checking for motorists' reactions . An Ohio police department have come under fire for setting up fake checkpoints to search drivers and their cars for drugs. Police in the city of Cleveland recently posted large yellow signs along Interstate 271 that warned drivers that there was a drug checkpoint ahead, to be prepared to stop and that there was a drug-sniffing police dog in use. There was no such checkpoint, just police officers waiting to see if any drivers would react suspiciously after seeing the signs. Authorities say that four people were stopped, with some arrests and drugs seized. They declined to be more specific. The . Plain Dealer in Cleveland reports that some civil rights leaders and at . least one person pulled over by police are questioning the tactic, . wondering if it could violate the Fourth Amendment against unlawful . searches and seizures. 'I . don’t think it accomplishes any public safety goals,' said Terry . Gilbert, a prominent Cleveland civil rights attorney. 'I don’t think . it’s good to mislead the population for any reason if you’re a . government agency.' Nick . Worner, a spokesman for the Cleveland office of the American Civil . Liberties Union, said his office will be looking further into the fake . checkpoints to determine whether anyone’s rights may be being violated. Dominic . Vitantonio, a Mayfield Heights assistant prosecutor, said the fake . checkpoints are legal and a legitimate effort in the war on drugs. 'We should be applauded for doing this,' Dominic Vitantonio said. 'It’s a good thing.' A 2000 U.S. Supreme Court ruling said actual drug checkpoints are not legal and that police can randomly stop cars for just two reasons: to prevent immigrants without legal permission to be in the U.S. and contraband from entering the country and to get drunk drivers off the road. No checkpoint: Police in Cleveland posted signs along Interstate 271 that warned drivers that there was a drug checkpoint ahead, to be prepared to stop and that there was a drug-sniffing police dog in use. There wasn't . It’s unclear how that ruling would apply to a fake drug checkpoint or whether any other police department in the nation has used similar tactics . Bill Peters, one of the four drivers pulled over as a result of the fake checkpoint, said he wonders if he was targeted because he has long, unkempt hair. Peters, of Medina, said he was driving on the interstate when he missed his exit. He pulled over to check his phone for directions, then pulled back onto the freeway when his phone disconnected from the charger, causing him to pull over again to reconnect it, he said. Soon after returning to the freeway, police pulled him over. Peters said the officer asked him what kind of drugs he had in the car, saying it would be much easier to confess before other officers and a drug-sniffing dog arrived. Peters insisted he had no drugs. As promised, other officers and the dog were summoned, and Peters agreed to allow his car to be searched. No drugs were found. 'The last time I checked, it is not against the law to pull over to the side of the road to check directions,' said Peters, who added that the officer who stopped him commended him for being safety conscious. 'I see what they’re doing, but I think it’s kind of dangerous,' Peters said. 'It’s one thing to do this on a 25 mph road; it’s another on a busy interstate. I think it’s a violation to just be pulled over and searched.'","Police in Cleveland posted large signs on I-271 warning of checkpoint ahead .

'The birth of the Duke and Duchess’s baby should be a . joyous occasion, and we recognise there is a long and happy history of . people producing souvenirs to mark Royal occasions,' a spokesman from the palace told the Daily Telegraph.

Cashing in? A 'royal' potty from Fisher Price and a dummy and clip by Elodie Details featuring crowns . Since Kate's pregnancy was announced last year, there has already been a plethora of products on the market marking the occasion from mugs and tea towels to baby grows and books. And once the baby is born this month and the sex and name is announced, even more related souvenirs will go on sale. The most desirable pieces are likely to be the ceramic cups, dishes and bowls which will vary from the cheap and cheerful to gold leaf-covered fine bone china creations costing hundreds of pounds. Stoke-on-Trent, the home of England's pottery industry, is a hive of activity as companies gear up for the big day, expected in mid-July. Drink to the royal birth: Commemorative mugs, from left, from Harrods, JoJo Maman Bébé and borngifted.co.uk .

Targetting tourists: London souvenir shops are full of gifts celebrating the Duke and Duchess and their new arrival . Designs have been drawn up and potters are waiting for the moment William and Kate's baby is born and named. Dr Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, highlighted how foreign collectors, especially from countries such as America and Japan, prize items from the UK. She said: 'This will be a welcome boost for UK tableware and giftware manufacturers, generating significant sales for many companies in the UK and overseas. 'UK manufacturers are uniquely placed to commence manufacturing as soon as the baby's name is announced and so respond rapidly to orders. 'Many customers value the 'Made in England' backstamp on cherished family items such as these marking royal occasions. Fit for a prince or princess: Royal Crown Derby have created a special collection of china to mark the occasion . Children's stores including Mothercare and Jo Jo Maman Bébé are also getting in on the act with their own 'royal collection' of clothing from maternity wear with the slogan 'future princess' to baby grows covered in crowns. Simon Calver, Mothercare chief executive, said they were not trying to 'cash in' with their range of prince and princess clothing. 'We're looking to commerate, celebrate, to . have a bit of fun. Babies are going to be the thing people talk about . this year,' he told the Telegraph. Meanwhile Fisher Price have released a 'royal' potty to help toddlers toilet train on a 'throne' of their own.

The memorabilia to mark the royal birth will be led by the official range produced by the Royal Collection Trust. In recent years, the organisation has produced high-quality bone china items to mark historic moments for the monarchy. A spokeswoman for the trust said: 'Royal Collection Trust has produced a number of commemorative china ranges to celebrate royal anniversaries and events, most recently for the royal wedding, the Diamond Jubilee, and the anniversary of the coronation in 2013. 'An official range to celebrate the birth of a future monarch would be made, but not until after the event.' Patriotic: LittlePunkLondon.com have launched a range in celebration featuring crowns and union flags . If the trust follows its past ranges, it will probably produce a collection of items to commemorate the baby, who will be third in line to the throne. These could include a coffee mug, tankard, pillbox and plate decorated with a floral pattern or even heraldic creatures. The pieces are likely to feature the individual cyphers of the Duke and Duchess - their initials, W or C, below a coronet - the baby's name and date it was born. In past years, members of the monarchy have approved designs before they have gone into production, so William and Kate are likely to have already cast an eye over the plans. If you don't have a baby to dress up like a prince or princess nor want to have your next cup of tea from a mug celebrating the royal birth, you can still join in the fun when you enjoy a treat thanks to Krispy Kreme. They are selling special editions doughnuts with pink and blue centres. The Duchess is said to have bought a Bugaboo Buggy Cameleon pram . From the name they choose to whether they give their baby a dummy, the Duke and Duchess' parenting choices are set to be followed by new parents around the country. Claire Irvin, editor-in-chief of Bauer Media's parenting portfolio which includes Mother & Baby magazine, predicts any baby product Kate is seen using - that is likely to be from the British High Street - will quickly sell out. She also believes the couple could spark new interest in eco-parenting. She said: 'Kate's really supported the British high street. They'll carry on what they started. They do seem to like to give the impression of being very grounded. 'We think she could spearhead a return to eco buys given Prince Charles' stance on the environment. Eco products took a bit of a hit with the recession when people wanted cost-effectiveness.' She added: 'If they use a dummy, it will send sales of dummies through the roof and vice-versa if they don't.' The buggy Kate is seen pushing will also become a must-have with new mothers. It is thought she has bought a trendy Bugaboo pram, priced at around £869.","Variety of products hitting shelves .

With a young leader trying to assert his authority, mounting international tension and a growing army trying to establish itself as a military force to be reckoned with, life in Korea at the end of the 19th century would probably not sound all that alien to the inhabitants of at least one half of the former empire today. But far from the acrimoniously divided pair of states we know now, Korea was still a vast single sovereignty. And instead of threatening global powers with aggressive threats of martial action - as in North Korea's case today - the nation, known until 1897 as Joseon, was desperately trying not to be bullied in a power struggle between China and Japan. This fascinating set of pictures gives a rare glimpse into life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Korea - a time of great change for the state. Defences: Namdaemun, pictured, is one of the Eight Gates in the Fortress Wall of Seoul which surrounded the city in the Joseon Dynasty. The image is one of a series which give a fascinating insight into Korean life more than a century ago .

Resting place of the kings: A Korean man strolls in the sunshine at one of the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty . Traditional dress: A young child, left, and a woman, right, show what traditional Korean dress looked like at the turn of the 20th Century . The pictures show iconic palaces and fortresses of the soon to be ousted Joseon dynasty, including the Gyeongbokgung Palace - first constructed in 1395, later burned and abandoned for almost three centuries, and then reconstructed in 1867 - the main and largest palace of the Five Grand Palaces built by the dynasty. Koreans are pictured walking among the final resting place of the kings, the Royal Tombs of Joseon - Korea's answer to the Pyramids of Giza - and peddler merchants trying to sell their wares. Of particular note, are early pictures of several of a series of eight gates which were part of a fortress wall which surrounded the city of Seoul during the Joseon rule, including the stunning Namdaemun gate - which is undergoing resotration work following an arson in 2008 - pictured complete with its historic 24-hour market. In one picture, the Korean class system is illustrated - at one stage during Joseon rule, a third of the population were said to be slaves. Grand: The Gyeongbokgung royal palace in Seoul was first constructed in 1395, later burned and abandoned for almost three centuries, and then reconstructed in 1867, it was the main and largest palace of the Five Grand Palaces built by the Joseon Dynasty . Trading place: The historic 24-hour Namdaemun market is located next to this 14th century gate, one of eight surrounding Seoul .

The palanquin is carried by the two men in the background. A lady's . personal maidservant follows the palanquin on foot. The class system was banned in 1894 . The pictures illustrate a great turning point in Korean history. At the tail end of the 19th century, . Korea had been in the grip of the Joseon dynasty for 500 years - . formed following a largely bloodless coup by general Yi Seong-Gye in 1392. The dynasty had survived intact a . bloody invasion by the Japanese in the late 16th century, which saw . invading warriors take around 200,000 noses cut from Korean's faces back . to their homeland as souvenirs following defeat, and numerous attempts . at a coup by the Manchu of China. The Joseon dynasty ruled Korea for just over five centuries. It was founded when the Goryeo Dynasty was overthrown in what is now the city of Kaesong. The dynasty was the last of Korean history and the longest-ruling Confucian reign. During its long reign, the dynasty encouraged the inclusion of Confucian ideals and doctrines in everyday society and imported and adapted much Chinese culture. It oversaw the height of classical Korean science, literature and technological advances. Cultural legacy: South Koreans wearing traditional costumes perform a ritual for the deceased Kings of the Joseon Dynasty at the royal shrine of Jongmyo during an annual royal memorial service in Seoul . But the dynasty was weakened in the 16th and 17th centuries when both Japan and China invaded - leading to the country adopting an isolationist attitude to its politics. It thus became known as the Hermit Kingdom. After a 200 year period of peace, its power waned however through the 18th and 19th centuries with international pressure and numerous rebellions taking their toll. The dynasty has left a substantial legacy to today's Korea including much of Korean etiquette, culture and dialect.

Korea had . long been a tributary nation to China and its Qing dynasty, but the two . countries association was to end when Japan and China went to war . primarily over Korean control and Japan was victorious. With the Chinese influence over Korea defeated, the 26th Joseon king, Gojong, proclaimed the Korean Empire and King Gojong became Emperor Gojong. The imperial government aimed to become a strong and independent nation by implementing domestic reforms; strengthening military forces, developing commerce and industry, and surveying land ownership. Organisations like the Independence Club also rallied to assert the rights of the Joseon people, but clashed with the government which proclaimed absolute monarchy and power.

Sun shades: Two men in traditional dress attempt to hide from the glare of the Korean sun, left, while an elderly man with a stick smiles for the camera while Korean peddler merchants work in the background . But the Empire was short lived - it lasted 13 years in all. Russia became increasingly influential in the country, much to the irritation of the Japanese and the two nations went to war over the sovereignty in 1904. Korea effectively became a protectorate of Japan in 1905 after the Japanese and Russians signed a treaty without the knowledge of Gojong at the end of the war. Gojong was forced to abdicate in 1907 and the Empire finally fell as the nation became an annexe of Japan in 1910. After the annexation, Japan set out to repress Korean traditions and culture, develop and implement policies primarily for the Japanese benefit.

Happy: Elderly Korean peddlars pictured smiling for the camera as they smoke pipes at a market stall . European-style transport and communication networks were established across the nation in order to extract the resources and labour; these networks were mostly destroyed later during the Korean War. The banking system was consolidated and the Korean currency abolished. The Japanese removed the Joseon hierarchy, destroyed much of the Gyeongbokgung palace and replaced it with the Government office building. Despite various anti-Japanese uprisings in the years that followed, the nation remained under Japanese rule until the aftermath of World War Two. The division of Korea into North and South came following the Japanese surrender to the Allied forces at the end of World War Two in 1945. Japan had occupied Korea before the end of the war and it became divided into two areas of influence once the fighting stopped - North Korea under Soviet influence and South Korea under US influence. With Cold War tensions building, the US and Soviet Union were unable to come to an agreement over a joint trusteeship over Korea and in 1948 the two Koreas formally separated, with each following a separate ideology - communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Republic of Korea (ROK) soldiers move in single file toward Korea's east-central front near Lookout Mountain, east of the Pukhan River, on June 28, 1953 during the Korean War . But the Southern state came under attack from the North just two years later when the North Korean People's Army tried to invade the South and reunite the two states under a communist ideology. The Korean Civil War saw some 1.2million people killed including more than 36,000 US soldiers, 500,000 South Koreans and 215,000 from the Korean People's Army. Civil war raged until July 1953 when, under the supervision of the United Nations, the two parties signed the Korean War Armistice agreement. Since then a Demilitarised Zone has separated the two nations, and technically they are still at war because only an armistice was signed and not a peace treaty. While North Korea has gone on to become a totalitarian state which is thought to be in the grip of poverty, South Korea has gone from strength to strength and is now one of Asia's most affluent countries.","The pictures give a glimpse of what life was like in Korea at the end of the turn of the 20th century .

Cleared: Aggro Santos was today found not guilty of raping two girls by a jury at Chichester Crown Court . Former I’m A Celebrity contestant Aggro Santos was today found not guilty of raping two girls he had taken back to his hotel rooms after performing at gigs. The jury at Chichester Crown Court acquitted the 24-year-old Brazilian-born rapper of both charges in less than two hours. His friend and co-defendant Tyrelle Ritchie, 22, was also found not guilty of oral rape. Both men broke down in tears as the jury foreman gave the verdicts. The public gallery, filled with the men’s families, erupted, and had to be cleared. The pair had consistently denied the allegations and said the sex with the two women was consensual. During the seven-day trial the jury heard Santos strenuously deny he had raped anyone. When he was questioned by detectives over the alleged sex assault in Chichester, the musician told officers: 'I would never have done that. 'It goes against everything I have been brought up with, my morals and my pride.' The prosecution had alleged Santos forced a woman aged in her 20s to have sex with him after he performed at the opening of Club Soho in Yeovil, Somerset, on September 25, 2010. He was accused of raping a then 16-year-old girl in 2011 after the University of Chichester summer ball while Ritchie, 22, was alleged to have forced her to perform oral sex on him. Santos, who stood trial under his real name Yuri Santos, of Tooting, south west London, denied two counts of rape. Ritchie, of Lambeth, south-east London, denied one count of oral rape. Santos’s debut single, Candy, featuring former Pussycat Dolls singer Kimberly Wyatt, shot to number five in the UK charts in 2010. But he became more popularly known by his appearance in the 2010 series of ITV’s reality game show I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, in which he reached the final six. The trial was a retrial after a jury last year failed to reach a verdict on the counts for both men.

'I'm an animal lover': Barry Rogerson with his dog who says he panicked when the 'charged' towards him . The man filmed punching a police horse during a football riot claimed yesterday he was acting in self-defence. Barry Rogerson, 45, who calls himself an animal lover, says he panicked as the horse ‘charged’ towards him. He says the medication he takes and the fact he had been drinking heavily may have prompted his actions. With a football scarf over his face, Rogerson was caught on camera throwing a punch at the horse, called Bud, before being tackled by officers and wrestled to the ground during violence after Newcastle United’s match against Sunderland on Sunday. Despite claiming he is too sick to hold down a job, Rogerson, who is on disability benefits, went to the match – which his team Newcastle lost 3-0 – and drank five pints of beer before becoming involved in clashes with police. He confessed yesterday that he was the fan who attacked the horse after a picture of him throwing the punch was plastered over the national media. Speaking from his home in Morpeth, Northumberland, Rogerson said he wanted to apologise to the public – and to Bud – for his rampage. ‘I’m an animal lover. I’ve got three dogs, a fishpond out the back and I feed foxes across the road,’ he said as he posed for pictures with one of his pets, a 15-year-old alsatian cross called Candy. Rogerson, who was arrested and has been bailed until next month, claims that he threw the punch in ‘panic’ and is now afraid to go out after animal rights activists put comments about him on social media. The former factory worker has not worked for eight years and claims £5,460 a year in disability living allowance and incapacity benefit. He says he suffers from sarcoidosis, an inflammation of the lungs. ‘I can’t even walk up the stairs. Doing . anything physical is hard,’ he said – but he was not able to explain why . that did not stop him attending the game and getting involved in the . violence. Caught: Barry Rogerson was captured on camera punching Bud the horse in the face . Rogerson claimed he was ‘not aware’ of the riots outside the ground in which three police officers were . injured and 29 fans arrested. He said he had his scarf covering his face to keep the cold off a broken filling in a tooth. He said: ‘We just came out of the Terrace Bar in St James’ Park, we turned right and I was right in the middle of it. ‘This . one particular horse was spooked by a firecracker and charged at me. That’s when I panicked and threw a punch at the horse. Recovered: Bud the police horse with groom Abigail Collins back at home in the Carr Gate police stables in Yorkshire after he was punched in the face . ‘I tried to get him away from me with my left hand and then punched him with my right. It was sheer panic. ‘It was an instant reaction. I did not actually go out to attack a horse. I’d like to apologise to the horse, to the mounted section and to the people of the North East.’ Rogerson claimed his reaction may have been down to the 15 tablets a day he takes for his illness. He lives in a £120,000 semi with his Portuguese wife Teresa, 47, and attended Sunday’s game with nine friends. His wife, a school supervisor, said: ‘It’s not in his character to do anything like that. ‘I let him out by himself once and look what happens. People on the internet who are writing things about him don’t know him. He wouldn’t hurt a fly.’ Rogerson says he is now living in fear after discovering he had been identified on Facebook and says up to 700 animal rights activists on Twitter are asking for his address. One Twitter user wrote yesterday: ‘Still can’t get over the fact that some Newcastle scumbag punched a police horse.’ Another raged: ‘Newcastle fan punches horse ******* nasty person!’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Barry Rogerson drank five pints before clashes with police .

A four-year-old girl who suffered a massive stroke in the womb has stunned doctors by using the healthy side of her brain to walk and talk. Parents Lisa and Lee Farrell, from Liverpool, Merseyside, were left devastated when a scan revealed their newborn daughter Maddie had suffered a stroke ten days earlier. They were told that the stroke had caused catastrophic damage to her brain she would never walk or speak. But although it has taken Maddie longer than normal to reach certain milestones she is all set to go to start her first day at school with her peers. Lisa (left) was devastated when she was told her daughter Maddie had suffered brain damage due to a stroke in the womb. But the plucky youngster, now four, has made amazing progress (right) Lisa, 39, said: 'After she was born we were told that, if she did survive, not to expect her to ever walk, talk or communicate. 'Now, she’ll be able to run through those schools gates. Thinking about everything she has overcome fills me with pride.' Professor Andy Shennan, Consultant . Obstetrician for the baby charity Tommy's said: 'A stroke in the womb . is basically a brain injury that results in disability and is . caused by  bleeding or a lack of oxygen. 'Around three in 1,000 babies will . have some form of brain damage leading to stillbirth while a further one . of two per 1,000 will have brain damage but survive. 'A baby has more potential to recover . from a stroke than an adult as they are better able to adapt to using . other parts of their brain. 'That said surviving such a major brain injury before birth is unusual, and it's remarkable Maddie is recovering so well.' As soon as Maddie was born, Lisa and Lee, 35, they say they knew there was a problem with their daughter and and when she was just a day old, their worst fears were confirmed. An ultrasound at Liverpool Women’s Hospital revealed she had suffered a massive brain injury in the womb. Mrs Farrell said: 'When Maddie was born I expected to hear crying but there was none of that. 'She was rushed off by the nurses and I didn’t see her till she was 12 hours old and she was on a ventilator. 'We didn’t know what to expect or what was going to happen. 'Then she was taken to the Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, where they told us she had the stoke ten days earlier - when she was still in the womb. 'When the doctor told us I couldn’t believe it, I though a stroke was something that only happened to older people. 'She had all these wires coming out of her and stuck to her head and she’d also shown some signs of seizures.' Maddie is treated using a bright blue fluorescent light to treat jaundice . Lisa and Lee with Maddie: She's one-in-a-million Lisa said of her daughter . Maddie remained in hospital for five and a half weeks and when she returned home, her parents were faced with the prospect of buying a wheelchair and looking into full-time care for their daughter. Medics warned the couple, who also have three older children, Aaron, 20, Georgia, 11 and Rhys, 10, that their little girl would never reach the usual milestones. But they were left stunned as Maddie used the other side of her brain to learn to walk and talk. Ready to start: Maddie is going to a mainstream school in Liverpool . Mrs Farrell said: 'She was seven months old when she sat up on her own for the first time. 'Up until then she had never given an indication of hope - she had never babbled like other babies or shown an interest in toys. 'We were crying and telling everyone about it. It might be something most people take for granted but for us it was so special.' At ten months old, she learnt to walk and said her first word at two-years-old. Maddie, who still suffers from anxiety, is due to start at Primary School in Liverpool today. It will be a proud day for her parents who only found out she would enter mainstream school in May. Mrs Farrell said: 'When we got the news, we were were made up. It was a massive weight off our shoulders. 'We’ve been told it’s so rare for a child to come on so far after everything she’s been through. She’s one-in-a-million.' Sonia Mundy, founder of the Childhood Strokes support group, has helped Maddie and her family over the past few years and watched Maddie’s amazing recovery. She said: 'Maddie’s story and family are amazing, and her recovery is so encouraging. Having to learn to accept that your baby or child has now got an acquired brain injury is so traumatic and so very isolating, and Maddie and her family have been very brave. 'Strokes effect babies in different ways and some babies don’t get recognised till some time down the line - even months - when the baby doesn’t seem to be developing as normal. 'There are no exact figures for the number of childhood strokes as there is no registry. 'A stroke is for life and the hurdles children face are huge. Stroke is an invisable condition sometimes as it’s the brain injury people can’t see. 'For mums and dads it so hard to explain the behaviour and problems that are hidden within our children.'

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 10:33 EST, 9 February 2012 . A species of mosquito capable of transmitting the deadly West Nile virus to humans has been discovered breeding in Britain for the first time since 1945. West Nile virus mostly infects birds but can be transmitted from birds to humans by the bites of mosquitoes. While symptoms usually include fever, skin rash or swollen lymph glands in can prove fatal if it enters the brain. Blood sucker: The species has been found breeding in the marshes of north Kent and south Essex over the past two years . 'It's not clear how long this species of mosquito (Culex modestus) has been in the UK,' said Nick Golding of Britain's Oxford University and the Center for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), who conducted the research. He added that although the mosquitoes have been found at sites in the marshes of north Kent and south Essex in 2010 and 2011. 'It's something to watch,' he said. The disease first appeared in the U.S in 1999 after circulating in Israel and Tunisia. There were 663 cases of the virus in America in 2009. Mr Golding suggested the new population had arrived fairly recently, possibly via international shipping. This is because other insects such as the Asian tiger mosquito have spread in this manner. 'The records are patchy but we have evidence that the furthest north this mosquito lives is the Netherlands, which has strong shipping links with the UK,' he told Mail Online. 'However, this is all speculation at this time.' He added that the West Nile virus could only spread if the mosquitoes came into contact with infected birds. Although humans can be infected the disease is not transmitted between them. Disease surveillance experts suspect the Culex modestus species may be behind recent sporadic epidemics outbreaks of West Nile virus in southern Europe. The virus, which survives in nature in a cycle involving transmission between birds and mosquitoes, is commonly found in Africa, the Middle East, North America and West Asia and can cause neurological disease and death in people. West Nile virus can cause encephalitis or meningitis if it enters the brain . Miles Nunn, a molecular parasitologist at CEH who reviewed the findings, said that in continental Europe Culex modestus mosquitoes are able to transmit West Nile virus because the virus can reproduce inside them, and then gets passed on when the mosquito feeds on both humans and birds. 'However, in the UK the mosquitoes biting habits and ability to transmit West Nile virus have yet to be investigated,' he said.A team from Oxford University and the Health Protection Agency are now conducting more studies to see how widespread the mosquitoes are and whether there is any risk to human health. The Stockholm-based European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which monitors disease in the European Union, said that as of January 13, 96 confirmed human cases of West Nile virus had been reported in the EU. More than two-thirds of them were in Greece with others in Hungary, Italy and Romania. A handful of Culex modestus were . collected on the southern coast of Britain and recorded more than 60 . years ago, but didn't appear then to be an established population.","Mosquito species may have arrived via international shipping .

But a leading doctor has revealed a catalogue of weird and wonderful items removed from people's ear canals. As well as pebbles, hearing aid parts, and buttons from mobile phones, other items have included a clove of garlic - because the patient suffering from earache had read that garlic has antibiotic properties. Then there was the tooth, because the little girl whose ear it was recovered from 'wanted to keep it somewhere safe for the tooth fairy'. Pebbles, buttons from mobile phones and even garlic cloves are amongst the catalogue of weird and wonderful items removed from people's ear canals by one doctor . The inventory of items was disclosed by experts from the Clear Ear Clinic, a London-based clinic dedicated to removing ear wax. 'Although the vast majority of our patients simply have a build-up of wax which can be quickly removed, other more unusual things can sometimes be found lurking,' said Dr Simon Gane, one of the clinic's founders. Dr Gane and his team remove more than 100 litres of ear wax annually – enough to fill a bath tub. Ear wax is a mixture of sebum, sweat and dried skin. The skin inside the ear canal is the only part of the body which grows horizontally towards the outer ear, acting as a natural escalator to clean itself. Most people naturally have some levels of ear wax and don’t notice any problems even if the canal is 95 per cent full. But if it exceeds this volume, it can cause itching, ear ache or mild deafness – which is when people try to remove it themselves. 'One of the biggest mistakes people is to try and remove wax with ear buds,' said Dr Gane. 'Patients have also admitted to us using hair grips, hair clips, paper clips, pens and pen tips, which is very dangerous' 'One of the biggest mistakes people make is . to try and remove wax with ear buds,' said Dr Gane. 'This simply . compacts the wax further into the ear canal, especially after a bath or . shower when it will be sticky. 'Patients have also admitted to us using hair grips, hair clips, paper clips, pens and pen tips,' said Dr Gane. He added: 'We can often tell what’s been used to clean ears as it leaves tell-tale indentations on the inside of the ear canal, or even abrasions and little cuts. 'People take their ears for granted. But they are very sensitive organs, and however much you’re tempted, you should not stick things right inside them. 'This can lead to ear infections or worse, perforated ear drums,' said Dr Gane. He advises using the corner of a warm, damp towel, which can reach the outer area of the ear canal where most of the wax is, or seeing a specialist. Most people naturally have some levels of ear wax and don¿t notice any problems even if the canal is 95 per cent full . One option is to have the ear wax syringed or alternatively, have the wax removed using microsuction. Unlike ear syringing, the microscope . allows them to peer right inside the ear, meaning they can spot what . else might be causing a blockage. 'Compared to the traditional “blind” forms of wax removal – such as ear drops or “syringing” – microsuction . allows clinicians to see where they are cleaning, making it safer, . quicker and more effective,' said Dr Gane. He uses binocular operating microscopes - . originally designed for ear surgery - and gentle suction, to remove ear . wax from more than 5,000 patients every year. As it does not use water to flush the wax out, the procedure is also better tolerated, and does not require pre-treatment with ear drops.","Ear doctor Simon Gane has also found bugs, cloves of garlic and pebbles .

High profile: Hacked Off, which has the backing of Hugh Grant, will not reveal who its top donors are . Pressure group Hacked Off is refusing to reveal who is bankrolling them despite campaigning for more transparency in the press. Senior members would not comment on claims that rich benefactors keen on greater media regulation were covering the costs of the group, which is supported by celebrities including Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan. Blogger Guido Fawkes claims he has a list that shows key donors include Lady Annabel Goldsmith, mother of Jemima Khan and Zac Goldsmith and billionaire Lord Sainsbury, who was one of Labour's biggest financial backers under Tony Blair. Another four high-profile donors were claimed to be philosopher Alain de Botton, tycoon Arpad Busson, hairdresser John Frieda and BBC star Jeremy Clarkson. Mr Clarkson, who is alleged to have made a £1,000 payment to Hacked Off, denied this on Twitter yesterday. The net worth of these rich and powerful men and women is far in excess of £1billion, and they may have helped support the parents of Milly Dowler and Madeleine McCann from press intrusion. Members were in front of the the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee today, but were criticised for their performance.

Unlawful burial: Angela Owen, 47, wrapped the body in a binliner before dumping it in a makeshift grave . A woman gave birth to a stillborn baby boy and secretly buried it in the grounds of the historic house she was living in after being kicked in the stomach by her partner, a court heard. Angela Owen, 47, wrapped the body in a binliner before dumping it in the makeshift grave in Halifax, West Yorkshire, 12 years ago. After keeping the crime secret for more than a decade, she handed herself in to police last year when a BBC Crimewatch appeal was launched. She has was given a 12 month community order at Bradford Crown Court yesterday after she admitted preventing the lawful burial of the child. Owen was living with her then boyfriend Paul Beaumont in the servant quarters of the 370-year-old Howroyd Hall when she gave birth prematurely while more than seven months pregnant. The remains were discovered in the grounds of the mansion once owned by Emmerdale actor Richard Thorpe when it was being renovated in 2006. Owen, now of Glastonbury, Somerset, gave birth to her stillborn child on her way to the toilet the night after being attacked by Mr Beaumont, the judge was told. She had been in a 'volatile' relationship with him and hadn't told him she was pregnant, the court heard. Owen said she saw her GP and told him she didn't want any more children, arranged for an abortion but never went through with it. Beaumont, who has served time for . fraud and driving offences, allegedly assaulted Owen around Christmas . 2001, when he 'kicked her repeatedly in the stomach'. Tests on the remains showed that it was the child of Owen and Mr Beaumont. Christopher Tehrani, prosecuting, said that Own explained: 'The baby just fell out with a whoosh'. 'She went on to say the baby was . stillborn, she put the baby in a bag and buried it under a Christmas . tree in the garden,' he added. Mr Tehrani said that bakery worker Owen didn't know she had to register the death of a child. A few months later they moved out of the property with their young daughter. Last year she admitted concealing the . birth of the boy and preventing his lawful burial, as well as six . unconnected offences of fraud between 2001 to 2004. Sentencing Owen, Judge Robert Bartfield said: 'The known facts are you gave birth to the child somewhere beyond seven months into your pregnancy. It having been born in the house you buried the child in the garden of the premises you were living. 'The circumstances of which this event took place can never to a finite degree ever be established.' Body find: The remains of the stillborn baby boy were unearthed in 2006 when Howroyd Hall, near Halifax, was being renovated . Kirstie Watson, mitigating, said Owen discovered she was pregnant in early 2001 but concealed the pregnancy. 'She maintains she was assaulted by him quite viciously on the night before she went into labour in and gave birth to a stillborn child,' she added. 'She was not thinking straight. The body was buried in the garden because she wanted it to be near her.' As well as completing her supervised community order, Owen must pay £400 towards prosecution costs. After the hearing, she said: 'I would like to thank my family and friends for support.' Howroyd Hall was owned by Emmerdale actor Richard Thorpe, who played pub landlord Alan Turner in Emmerdale, for 11 years until 1998. The house, with a grade one listing, was built in 1642 by William Horton, one of the area's largest landowners, for his bride Elizabeth Gledhill and had links with the Horton family for more than 300 years. Guy Fawkes, Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton are all believed to have stayed there. It also has many associations with the music world. Composer Ivor Novello was a frequent visitor and it was while staying at The Howroyd in the 1940s that he was inspired to write 'Perchance to Dream' and the music and lyrics of his best-known song 'We'll Gather Lilacs in the Spring Again.'","Angela Owen, 47, gave birth to the baby boy prematurely in 2001 .

You might view your weekly commute as nothing more than a routine part of your day, but new research suggests it is actually fraught with danger. The study has revealed that Britons typically risk serious injury 32 times during their weekly commute and 1.7 million have had to take time off work after getting hurt. Accidents most commonly occur due to crossing roads without looking properly, running down escalators and eating on the move. Britons typically risk serious injury 32 times during their weekly commute and 1.7 million have had to take time off work after getting hurt . Other hazards include jumping . onto a bus or train as the doors close, which 40 per cent of commuters admit . to doing - and nipping into the road to overtake slow walkers, . which 39 per cent do. Commuters also confess to waiting in the middle of the road for traffic to clear and 35 per cent say they duck and weave through crowds. The average commuter takes more than 1,600 risks which could result in serious injury a year, the report reveals. Train commuters are most at risk at 8.29am because this is when major stations are at their busiest. Women take more risks commuting than men - 35 per week - and workers in Manchester top the list of biggest risk takers – they take 48 risks per week, according to the research by insurance company LV. Mark Jones, of the insurer LV, which carried out the research, said: ‘The average urban British commuter taking so many risks, and so frequently, is concerning. ‘Everyone knows freak accidents can happen, but here we're talking about hazards that can be avoided. ‘It's about slowing down and being more mindful, and thinking more carefully about the consequences of our actions.‘Physical wellbeing is important to everyone, but an accident can also have serious consequences on people's finances. Train commuters are most at risk at 8.29am, when major stations are at their busiest, and women take more risks commuting than men . ‘Whether you're single or have a family, are renting or own your property, if you are no longer able to work and earn an income each month many people would struggle to make ends meet for long.’ Statistics show that people who have an accident crossing the road without looking are laid up for an average of 3.5 months. Those who are injured standing over the yellow line at a train platform tend to be off sick for 3.4 months, and people who slip when rushing through crowds, for 3.2 months.

Rowan Atkinson has claimed the BBC should have been allowed to axe Miriam O’Reilly from Countryfile without facing claims of age discrimination. The Blackadder and Mr Bean star criticised the presenter’s landmark ageism tribunal victory last year, saying it was an ‘attack on creative free expression’. The 57-year-old said ‘creative industries’ were ‘completely inappropriate environments’ for anti-discrimination legislation – and the ‘legal tools’ she used to win her case ‘should never have been available to her’. Wading into the row: Rowan Atkinson (left) said the BBC should have been allowed to axe Miriam O'Reilly (right) without facing discrimination claims . He said her complaint that she was axed from Countryfile due to her age – she was then 51 – was ‘no more sensible’ than Pierce Brosnan complaining he was dropped as James Bond for being too old, ‘which he was and which he is’. In a letter to Radio 4’s The Media Show, Mr Atkinson said if programme-makers wanted to replace an ‘old person with a young person’ or ‘a white person with a black person’ or a ‘disabled straight with an able-bodied gay’ they should have the ‘creative freedom to do so’.

"By . Neil Sears . PUBLISHED: . 08:56 EST, 27 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:01 EST, 28 May 2012 . One of the country’s leading jockeys has had 20 of his horses die during or after races in the past five years, it emerged yesterday. Two other top jockeys have suffered the deaths of 17 and 16 horses respectively over the same period. The figures, produced by an animal rights group, fuel claims that horse racing is cruel, and should be restricted. Fatalities: AP McCoy riding Synchronised at the 2012 Grand National, shortly before their fatal fall . Animal Aid say that the jockeys’ death rates are broadly reflective of those across the entire sport, with the top riders having more deaths just because they have more races. The figure of 20 was for champion jockey Tony McCoy, whose mount Synchronised died in last month’s Grand National. In the same race, According To Pete also died, leading to a wave of concern about welfare. At the time, McCoy, one of Britain’s most successful jockeys and BBC Sports Personality of the Year two years ago, said: ‘It is one of those terrible things you wish would never happen.’ He described Synchronised, on which he had won the Gold Cup at Cheltenham in March, as ‘a horse I won’t ever forget’. Last year alone, McCoy’s mount Kerensa died in a race at Towcester in December, A Stones Throw died after a race at Market Rasen in July, Zarinski also died at Market Rasen in January, and Lethal Glaze died after the races at Cheltenham on New Year’s Day. With the figures suggesting McCoy has ridden in 3,987 races over the past five years, he has lost a horse every 199 races. Fellow jockeys with high death counts since 2007 include Richard Johnson, with 17 lost horses, and Tom Scudamore, with 16. Animal Aid says Scudamore has lost one horse every 167 races. The group’s director Andrew Tyler said 180 horses died in British race meetings in the past year. He added: ‘Most people would be shocked that so many horses die after being raced by these top jockeys. However, these jockeys are actually no worse than the average. Synchronised was the 20th mount ridden by AP McCoy to die during or after a race since 2007 . ‘They have accumulated the highest death tallies because they ride a lot of races. The real point is that this kind of attrition rate is typical of all jump racing. The sport is inherently lethal to horses.’ The British Horseracing Authority and the Professional Jockeys’ Association accepted the figures, but defended racing. Robin Mounsey, of the BHA, said: ‘British racing is among the world’s most regulated of animal activities and we are very open about injuries and fatalities.’ A BHA spokesman said there were 95,000 races run by individual horses in Britain last year. He added: ‘In 2011, the overall equine fatality rate was 0.19 per cent of these 95,000 runners.’ Jockeys’ Association spokesman Paul Struthers said: ‘Leading jockeys will ride far more horses per year than others, so, simply by the law of averages, they are more likely to see some of their mounts suffer fatal injuries.'","AP McCoy tops ominous chart, losing one horse for every 199 he has ridden since 2007 .

The White House admitted today it was 'self-evident' that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya was a terrorist act - but the President himself refused to use this phrase or confirm al-Qaeda involvement. U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens and three others were killed in the deadly assault on the Benghazi compound on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. President Obama said on Thursday that extremists used an anti-Islam video as an excuse to assault U.S. interests overseas, including the attack on the consulate. Speaking at a candidate forum on the Spanish-language network Univision, Obama said: 'What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.' Scroll down for video . Quizzed: Obama said on Thursday during a town hall that extremists used the anti-Islam video to assault U.S. interests overseas including the attack on the consulate in Libya . 'Not at risk': Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said today that there was no information ambassador to Libya Chris Steven (right) was on an al Qaeda hit list . Asked if that meant al-Qaeda, Obama said: 'We don't know yet.' He added: 'We will focus narrowly and forcefully on groups like al Qaeda, the ones that carried out the 9/11 attacks. Those forces have not gone away.' Republicans have accused the Obama administration of misreading the assault as the outgrowth of widespread demonstrations in the Middle East over the video. They insisted it was a terrorist attack, a term White House spokesman Jay Carney used on Thursday. Obama did not use the phrase. Earlier in the week, senior State department officials had refused to call the raid an act of terrorism. However nine days after the attacks, Carney said: 'It is, I think, self evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. 'Our embassy was attacked violently and the result was four deaths of American officials. That is self evident.' Under the spotlight: Obama was questioned by Univision news anchors Jorge Ramos, left and Maria Elena Salinas, center, at the University of Miami in Florida . 'Self-evident': White House spokesman Jay Carney said today the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Libya were acts of terror . Carney's admission came after director of the U.S. National Counter-terrorism Center, Matthew Olsen, told the Senate on Wednesday that the attack was planned . and not merely the result of protesters demonstrating against an . anti-Islamic film. 'I would say yes, they were killed in . the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy,' Olsen said at a Senate . Homeland Security Committee hearing. The new revelations were after Hillary Clinton said today there was 'no information' that the U.S. Ambassador to Libya was on an al-Qaeda hit list despite his alleged fears of an attack. Chris Stevens had worried about what . he called the 'never-ending' security threats in the Libyan city and was . concerned about the increasing threats of Islamic extremism and al-Qaeda, CNN reported. However . the Secretary of State said she had 'no reason to believe that there's . any basis for that', referring to a report where a source . close to Stevens relayed his concerns. The . revelations raise yet more questions . about why the ambassador and the three other U.S. citizens killed in the attack were . at the consulate with scant security. Clinton faced questions from members of . the House and Senate about the September 11 attack on the consulate in . Benghazi in a series of closed-door classified briefings on Capitol . Hill. Concerns: Chris Stevens, pictured speaking to Council member for Misrata Dr. Suleiman Fortia, said he was on an al Qaeda hit list before he was killed in an attack on the Benghazi consulate . Leader: Sufyan Ben Qumu, who has known extremist ties, became one of the top commanders of rebel forces in Benghazi . Clinton also announced that, in line with federal law, she will appoint an independent panel to look at circumstances of the attack in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Stevens and three other employees. The so-called Accountability Review Board will be chaired by retired diplomat Thomas Pickering, she said. Democrats and Republicans emerging from the briefings provided some details about what the administration is still piecing together - who was responsible, how much of it was planned and what was the security. Joining Clinton at the briefings were Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said it was 'clearly a terrorist attack,' but mortars weren't used until six, seven hours into the fight. Smith added: 'So it seemed like an armed gang that seized an opportunity.' Both Smith and Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersburger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said there was no evidence to suggest that the local Libyans at the consulate colluded with the attackers. Some reports have suggested that Sufyan bin Qumu, a former detainee at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who was transferred to Libya in 2007, was involved. Lawmakers asked about Qumu at the briefing. 'But not directly related to the attack, but as someone who's in that region,' Smith said. 'They're attempting to establish whether or not he was connected to the people who made the attack. He's certainly a person of interest.' Investigators have found no evidence or intelligence to suggest Qumu was at the conflict, leading it or organizing it, according to a U.S. official. Attack: The US embassy in Benghazi was raided on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks . Deadly: Four people died, including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens, during an assault on the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya . The former al-Qaeda terrorist released from Guantanamo Bay had been named . as the apparent leader of the attack on the U.S. consulate. Sufyan Ben Qumu, who was reportedly . once Osama bin Laden's driver, was let out of the U.S. military detention . center in Cuba in 2007 and turned over to the government of Muammar . Gaddafi on the condition he be kept behind bars. The . US military characterized him as a 'medium to high' risk to national . security while he was in U.S. custody and he refused to cooperate with . authorities and explain his past associations with Islamic extremists. Qumu, 53, is a Libyan army veteran . who was jailed by Qaddafi and later escaped and moved to Sudan, where he worked . for one of Osama bin Laden's holding companies. According to some reports, he was bin Laden's driver during his time at the company. However, he denies this. He . also fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan with the Mujaheddin. Later he took up arms against the Northern Alliance and fought alongside . the Tabliban. Later, . he moved to Pakistan and slipped across the border into Afghanistan, . where he began working at a charity that was a front for al-Qaeda in the . summer of 2001. He was arrested in Pakistan by local . authorities shortly after the US invasion of Afghanistan. He was taken . to the Guantanamo Bay detention center and held there for six years. Tragic: John Christopher Stevens is the first US Ambassador to be killed by violence overseas since 1979. He apparently died of smoke inhalation after the attack on the consulate in Benghazi . Victims: Sean Smith (left), 34, was a foreign service computer expert who had previously been posted to Baghdad. Glen Doherty, 42, was a former US Navy SEAL who was working as a private security contractor . Despite his lengthy association with . extremists, including the 9/11 mastermind and al-Qaeda leader himself, . the military recommended in a 2005 report sending him back to his home . country of Libya. In 2007, Qumu was released from Gitmo and turned over to Gaddafi on the condition that he be kept in prison. But, in 2010 Gaddafi freed him from . the notorious Abu Salim prison in Tripoli, along with 37 other . prisoners, to celebrate the dictator's 41st year in power. During the uprising, Qumu emerged as a leader of the rebels. He was a tank driver during his time in the Libyan army, though he had been arrested several times on drug and alcohol offenses. In . addition to Mr Stevens, who friends said devoted his life to promoting . peace and cultural understanding, three other Americans were killed when . a mob attacked and burned the consulate in former rebel stronghold . city. Wrecked: The consulate was badly damaged in the attack that forced US personnel to flee . Extremists: The Libyan government blamed the attack on Islamic extremists angry over the release of a trailer for an American anti-Islam movie . Sean Smith, a foreign service officer, was a 34-year-old father of two. Glen Doherty, 42, was a former US Navy SEAL who was working at the consulate as a private security contractor. The attack on the consulate came after the release of a trailer for the controversial movie 'The Innocence of Muslims,' which paints a portrait of Islam that many in the Muslim world find deeply offensive. Senate Republicans expressed . frustration with the information provided at the sessions and disputed . the administration's assessment. 'There's increasing amount of . evidence that this was a coordinated attack by terrorists,' said Senator . Marco Rubio, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. 'The movie wasn't the catalyst for . this, the catalyst was radical Islamic extremists that wanted to attack . the United States and saw an opportunity to do it in Benghazi.' One of the harshest critics of the . administration, Senator John McCain, scoffed at the administration's . argument that the video set off the assault. 'I'm stunned that they thought this was some kind of spontaneous demonstration,' McCain told reporters. Destruction: The White House has now named the attack an act of terrorism .

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 15:33 EST, 10 August 2011 . The New York policeman acquitted of acting as a lookout while his partner raped a woman in her apartment was jailed today for two months. Franklin Mata, 29, will spend 60 days in prison after a judge labelled him ‘forever disgraced’ and rapped him for lying during the sensational ‘rape cops’ trial in Manhattan earlier this year. He will remain free until an appeal hearing over the jailing for official misconduct on September 12 and it comes just two days after Mata’s partner Kenneth Moreno, 43, was sent to prison for one year. Also jailed: Franklin Mata, 29, will spend 60 days in prison after a judge labelled him 'forever disgraced' and rapped him for lying during the sensational 'rape cops' trial in Manhattan earlier this year . Moreno and Mata were both acquitted of rape and burglary charges after they returned to a drunk woman’s flat in Manhattan three times after helping her out of a taxi in December 2008. ‘I didn't think that one night would end up costing me two-and-a-half years of my life and my career,’ he told Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Gregory Carro. ‘I never meant for anyone to get hurt that night,’ Mata said, pleading that he would avoid jail over the incident involving the young fashion executive, who now lives in San Francisco, California. ‘I loved my job and worked hard to get where I was, and now it's all gone.’ But Judge Carro slammed the former cop. ‘For some reason you continued to carry your partner's bags throughout the trial,’ he said. ‘Your testimony - clearly (it) wasn't wholly truthful.’ ‘Maybe (Moreno's lawyer Joseph Tacopina) was referring to you when he said “simpleton”. Maybe you are the simpleton following the fox. I don't hold you in the same light as your co-defendant.’ Other sentencing: Kenneth Moreno arrives at court on Monday with defence lawyer Joseph Tacopina . Judge Carro told him: ‘Forever you will be a disgraced police officer’. He added that Mata ‘drew the short straw’ when he was partnered with Moreno, reported the New York Post. ‘I didn't think that one night would end up costing me two-and-a-half years of my life and my career. I never meant for anyone to get hurt that night. I loved my job and worked hard to get where I was, and now it's all gone' Franklin Mata . The judge said his reasoning for the lower sentence than Moreno was because Mata is a young man whose future was ruined by his partner and he had received strong letters of support. Meanwhile Moreno has also been allowed to remain free pending appeal - even though he was already on his way to Rikers Island prison by the time he heard, reported the New York Post. Defence lawyer Chad Seigel, who was told off by the judge earlier in the case for comparing a woman’s genitals to a ‘Venus fly trap’, said of Moreno: ‘He’s not going anywhere’. Moreno will also return to court on September 12 so a trial can be set out for when a small amount of seized heroin was allegedly found in his police locker shared with another officer. Convicted: Kenneth Moreno, left, pictured with defence lawyer Chad Seigel, and his colleague Franklin Mata had been summoned to help the drunken woman get out of a taxi in December 2008 . On Monday Moreno was labelled a corrupt liar who thought he was 'above the law' by prosecutors as he was sentenced. ‘For some reason you continued to carry your partner's bags throughout the trial. Your testimony - clearly (it) wasn't wholly truthful. Maybe (Moreno's lawyer Joseph Tacopina) was referring to you when he said “simpleton”. Maybe you are the simpleton following the fox. I don't hold you in the same light as your co-defendant' Judge Gregory Carro . 'You're a trained police officer,' Judge Carro told him. 'It's not too far a stretch to believe that you couldn't avoid being in that bed with a naked female. 'Your testimony was classic for admitting what you couldn’t deny, denying what you couldn’t admit and classic tailoring of your testimony to the witnesses who testified before you.' 'You were in bed with an intoxicated naked young woman - that is official misconduct.’ The woman wanted to make a victim statement during proceedings, but the judge refused as she is now not legally a victim after Moreno and Mata were acquitted of rape. Both Moreno and Mata were fired from the police department within hours of their convictions for official misconduct in May. Caught on camera: CCTV footage shows the two police men outside the woman's apartment . Some jurors said later that they had too much doubt to convict in a rape case with an accuser who acknowledged her memories were spotty - and without DNA evidence implicating the officers. Mata and Moreno met the woman after a taxi driver called for help getting her out of his cab. She told authorities she passed out and awoke to being raped in her bed, saying she acutely remembered being violated despite being unclear on significant parts of the night. She secretly recorded a conversation days later in which Moreno alternately denied they had sex but said 'yes' twice when she asked whether he had used a condom. He said he was trying to mollify her. The former officers acknowledged returning to her apartment three times without telling dispatchers or supervisors what they were doing - the genesis of their misconduct convictions. Evidence: The woman described in court how she remembered being raped on the night in December 2008 . In fact, Moreno admitted he even placed a phony 911 call about a sleeping vagrant to provide a pretext for one of the visits. The officers said she had asked them to come back and check on her, and Moreno said he felt impelled to give her advice about drinking and to comfort her. He said she made advances and he ultimately ended up cuddling with the barely dressed woman in her bed, but that they didn't have sex. Mata said he was sleeping on her sofa while the others were in the bedroom. She said after the verdict her 'world was turned upside-down by the actions of two police officers who were sent there to protect but instead took advantage of their authority and broke the law.' The case ignited protests from women's advocates, who saw it as a discouraging example of the difficulty women face in coming forward with a sexual assault complaint.","Franklin Mata, 29, sent to prison for 60 days by Judge Gregory Carro today .

Many of the GPs handed control over NHS budgets from today have financial interests in private health companies. Some have already ‘awarded themselves’ contracts worth tens of thousands of pounds. Lay members of the newly-formed Clinical Commissioning Groups, including Arthur Scargill’s son-in-law, could also profit. Many GPs who have been given control of NHS budgets have financial interests in private health companies (file picture) In one of the biggest ever NHS shake-ups, these groups have been given responsibility for more than two-thirds of the health service’s annual budget. Every GP’s practice is affiliated to one of 211 commissioning groups, whose boards of GPs, nurses, hospital doctors and lay members will decide how to spend the local health budget. The reforms are intended to cut bureaucracy, reduce costs and foster competition, encouraging private firms and charities to take on health service contracts. The CCGs stress board members do not take part in decisions about their companies but fears over conflicts of interest remain. Labour warns giving family doctors control of local budgets has created a ‘colossal conflict of interest at the heart of the NHS’. Examples of potential conflicts include NHS Bury’s CCG in Greater Manchester, where chairman Dr Kiran Patel is founder of a weight management company and a shareholder in a cosmetic laser treatment firm. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said there is a risk public trust in the NHS will be 'lost' Bury CCG awarded a contract of around £130,000 to his company, ABL Health. Dr Patel told the Sunday Times that an independent audit committee will ensure all contracts are fairly awarded. He added that he is reducing his involvement with ABL Health and had not taken part in discussions around the contract. The boards also have lay members. For instance, Jim Logan, son-in-law of militant miners’ leader Arthur Scargill, is on the board of NHS Barnsley CCG. Mr Logan, a mining engineer turned NHS business manager, is the founder of Pain Management Solutions, a ‘national service providing pain management services in the community on behalf of the NHS’. As a member of the CCG, he will help to distribute the £350million local health budget and award contacts to healthcare firms. Recent . research by the British Medical Journal found more than a third of GPs . on the boards of CCGs have financial links to firms which could profit . from the shake-up. Andy . Burnham, the shadow health  secretary, said: ‘There is now a real risk . that the doctor-patient relationship will be  corroded and public trust . in the NHS lost.

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 15:59 EST, 3 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:02 EST, 3 May 2013 . The new NHS 111 system faces meltdown this weekend, doctors fear. The warning came as it emerged that at least three patients may have died because of failings in the helpline. As well as the deaths, a further 19 cases involving poor care are being investigated – even though 111 has been running for only a few weeks. The figures emerged as A&E departments braced themselves for a surge of patients over the bank holiday weekend as a result of flaws in 111. A&E departments are braced for a surge of patients over the bank holiday as a result of flaws with 111 . Hospitals have already been inundated with patients with non-urgent conditions sent by unqualified call centre staff manning the new line. This weekend is the first bank holiday since the helpline was launched last month and there are concerns it will not be able to cope with the extra demand brought about by GP surgeries being closed for three days. Many hospitals have drafted in extra doctors and nurses to deal with a surge in admissions expected this weekend and back-up plans are in place to set up temporary wards. The 111 system has replaced NHS Direct and local GP out-of-hours numbers. But the lines are manned by call centre staff with no medical training using a computer system which is liable to crash. Some critically-ill patients have waited 11 hours to be called back by a nurse and the British Medical Association has warned that lives are being put at risk. Figures obtained by Pulse magazine confirmed that at least three patients are feared to have died due to failings in the helpline. But the true number is likely to be higher because many organisations contracted to run 111 refused to provide data. One 83-year-old patient died in the East Midlands after their friend called 111 and said they had collapsed with severe abdominal pain. It is feared that the call centre employee failed to summon an ambulance quickly enough and when paramedics eventually arrived the patient was dead. At least three people have died as a result of flaws in the system, while the real figures are thought to be higher . Another patient died in the West Midlands after they dialled 111 and were told to go to their nearest GP clinic. NHS Direct, which runs the helpline in that area, would not provide details but said it was being investigated along with six other non-fatal incidents. A third death involving a suspected overdose is being looked at in the East Midlands. The family called 111 and requested mental health assistance but the patient was found dead at their house. A total of 22 ‘serious untoward incidents’ – including the three deaths – are being investigated although the true number is likely to be higher as most organisations refused to provide figures. Dr Peter Holden, a senior GP at the British Medical Association said: ‘We don’t know how serious these incidents have been. More to the point, we don’t know how many calls have been abandoned. East Kent NHS Trust said extra doctors and nurses would be working this weekend at all three of its A&E units – at William Harvey in Ashford, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate and Kent & Canterbury Hospital. Managers have drawn up contingency . plans in case there is a surge of patients. These include providing . extra beds and temporary wards. Norfolk and Norwich Hospital and Leeds Teaching Hospitals have hired extra nurses. Dr Taj Hassaan, vice president of the College of Emergency Medicine, who works at Leeds said: ‘We’re worried that this is the first bank holiday following the launch of 111. At a time where 111 in parts of the country is fragile, we need to plan as well as we can.’ The concerns come as the Government is considering making GPs take back responsibility for out-of-hours treatment. A controversial contract negotiated under Labour in 2004 enabled them to opt-out of working evenings and weekends even though their salaries soared. NHS England, the new body running the health service which earlier this week announced an urgent review of the 111 helpline, said fines would be handed out to organisations responsible for ‘seriously poor performance’. Dr Peter Carter, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing said: ‘It has collapsed. What’s happening is that because people are not able to get through they are giving up and self-referring to A&E. ‘Waits of between 12 and 24 hours [in A&E] are now commonplace.’","Doctors fear that the NHS 111 system faces meltdown this weekend .

The micro-housing boom taking the U.S. by storm has come under attack from residents who believe they will make cities too overcrowded. Residents in Seattle are among those fighting back against thousands of tiny apartment homes being built in response to demand for affordable housing. The 10ft by 10ft 'Apodments', around the same size as a generous parking space, have become increasingly popular in the city in recent years. Judy Green, 67 says she enjoys living in her 10ft by 10ft micro-apartment in Seattle . Kris King spreads his arms as he shows off his Seattle flat: Even Mr King was initially shocked by the size of the apartment he rented near downtown, which is roughly the size of a large parking space . Not great for dinner parties... King, 36, works as a counselor at a downtown Seattle homeless service centre and pays $750 for his unit, roughly 120 square feet, which includes utilities and Internet . Compact: Mr King stands in the kitchen, which is adjacent to the bed which is next to an open closet . For as little as $500 (£320) a month renters can get a one-bedroom apartment and access to a shared kitchen, often with utilities, furnishings and Internet included. Most are occupied by young urban singles, retirees who prefer city living, students and others looking to downsize. Judy Green, 67, lives in an $850 a month apodment which features a sleeping loft, a private toilet and shower, a kitchenette with a sink, fridge and granite countertop, a skylight, two windows and a sliding-glass door to a small private deck. She is also across the hall from the shared rooftop with a view of the Space Needle.'I think this is a wonderful thing,' she said. Campaigners say apodment blocks like this are overpopulating and driving out established families . Micro-housing projects are proliferating in many of America's biggest cities including New York, Seattle and San Francisco. But many established residents are unhappy at the pace of expansion. Since 2006, Seattle has permitted 48 micro-housing projects. If all are built, they would provide living quarters for about 2,300 people. Neighborhood . activists estimate that 19 of the developments already are renting or . are being built within just one square-mile area. Campaigners say the micro-apartments crowd too many people together, are not compatible with some neighbourhoods, do not encourage people to put down roots, and circumvent planning laws. 'They’re maxing out what they can do under the land use code,' said Patrick Tompkins, who lives in the Capitol Hill, where some projects have replaced family homes, sometimes without much warning. The tiny units has been around for at least three decades, but micro-apartments have taken off in the last three years, said Bryan Stevens with Seattle’s planning department. 'It’s really coincided with the recession. Apparently there’s pent-up demand,' he said. Opponent Carl Winter said the projects are seeing older homes torn down to make way for people who may only stay for a few months. 'We’re not concerned with who these people are, but . with how many there are. This is a massive increase in density,' he told the Seattle Times. Smallest of them all? Eddie Rabon, 24, in his 'micro' apartment at West 47th Street, New York City, which he claims is just 55 square feet. New York is one of the cities where such micro-habitations are most popular . If they can make it there, they can make it anywhere: Zaarath and Christopher Prokop - and their two cats - live in what they believe the smallest apartment in the city, a 175-square-foot 'microstudio' in Morningside Heights . Mr Winter, is among those lobbying . Seattle City Council for a moratorium. He believes the city is providing . an incentive for builders by not enforcing the normal regulations. Builders are claiming they have only . six or eight kitchens, the definition of a dwelling unit, to bypass the . need for a full design and environmental review usually required for a . large-scale development. But . conversely, they are using the total number of sleeping units, 56 or 64 . for example, to take advantage of a tax exemption scheme by reserving . some for low-income workers. Council member Tim Burgess said the city is missing out on a substantial amount of money in lost tax revenue. 'What’s . troubling is the city looks like it’s twisting the rules to favour . developers, and that’s not appropriate,' he told the Seattle Times.

'We believe Twitter is valuable to everybody on the planet': Twitter boss Dick Costolo has revealed his plans for global social network domination . The chief executive of Twitter has revealed he wants the microblogging site to be as big as Facebook - with one billion users. Dick Costolo reignited the row with his company's most bitter rival by taking aim at the milestone Facebook only reached in October after nine years of operation. Twitter only has 500million users and has been running for seven years. Mr Costolo, 49, said: ‘I don't think about our goals in terms of other companies. ‘Where we want to get to is human scale, global scale. That's a billion users, not where we are today. 'We're the size that 99.9 per cent of the other companies would like to be, but we believe Twitter is valuable to everybody on the planet.’ Twitter and Facebook are bitter rivals and last year came to blows over photo sharing service Instagram. Facebook eventually bought the site for $1billion but only after talks with Twitter for a $525million plus Twitter stocks deal fell through. According to the New York Times, Instagram chief executive Kevin Systrom had agreed a verbal deal with Twitter before Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg intervened. Mr Costolo said that once people become core users Twitter is ‘indispensable'. But he admitted: ‘You have to invest, frankly, too much to get that ""aha"" moment. ‘One of the things that we're spending a great deal of time on are weekly digest emails for casual users. It's a great way for people to start realizing, ""that's amazing and I need to be checking in more frequently."" On the up: Twitter only has 500million users - half as many as Facebook - and has been running for seven years . The new video-sharing service on Twitter has already been inundated with pornographic footage. One hardcore clip appeared as the editor’s pick at the top of the home page of Vine. Word spread and the footage soon received a ‘popular now’ ranking. The risqué video was posted by a user called NSFWVine – a reference to the ‘not safe for work’ warning some users deploy when posting sexually explicit content. It is just one of the hundreds of short porn videos which have appeared on the site since it launched last Thursday. The social networking service apologised for what it said had been a mistake with the editor’s pick but refused to automatically take down explicit clips – saying that would be censorship. The Twitter boss did discuss the tit-for-tat scraps with Facebook that have made their feud bitter and very public. In one such conflict, Instagram shut off an option that let Twitter users show Instagram pictures, prompting Twitter to introduce its own photo filters to encourage users to switch away from Instagram. Commentators have dubbed the row ‘The Photo Wars’ as they are over photo sharing applications for smartphones and computers. In the interview with the Wall Street Journal Mr Costolo also told of his excitement at buying video startup Vine, and said it was ‘not necessarily inevitable’ that Twitter would follow Facebook and go public. Facebook’s stock market floatation was the most disastrous in living memory and sparked a £1.8billionn lawsuit against the company and Zuckerberg himself . Mr Costolo said: ‘There are lots of different choices companies can make now. ‘A couple of years ago (Twitter) had a large private financing, and you're seeing other companies do that now. I think that's great. ‘It affords companies a lot of different ways to think about financing growth.’","Dick Costolo believes 'Twitter is valuable to everyone on the planet'

Not tolerated: Police have staged a crackdown on 'offensive clothing' worn by revellers in the seaside town . Long known as a place where teenagers booze and rowdy stag and hen parties flock to, Newquay has battled with its reputation as a raucous destination. Now the seaside town is taking drastic to wipe its streets of drunken louts - by banning the mankini. Police say a decision to ban the revealing one piece and other 'inappropriate clothing' from their town has helped significantly reduce anti-social behaviour and recorded crime. Officers in Newquay say the Cornish resort is shedding its reputation as a haven for drunken revellers and stag parties as a result of the zero-tolerance approach to risque fancy dress. The news comes as a delight for locals who regularly see men squeezing themselves into the skimpy suit in their home town. Some visitors to Newquay, including . children as young as 15, have been sent home as a result of anti-social . behaviour, while older fun-seekers have had skimpy costumes seized by . police - including mankinis, a thong-like male bathing costume . popularised by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen’s spoof documentary character . Borat. In an interview marking the end of a . successful summer season, Devon and Cornwall Police Superintendent Julie . Whitmarsh said the town had come a long way in the last three years, . thanks to concerted efforts to help clean up the town’s reputation. 'We have had this consistency of . seizing inappropriate items of clothing, sending people home to get . changed, and that has worked, it has made a real difference, this . ‘no-nonsense attitude’,' said the 47-year-old. 'Mankini is what we term ‘offensive clothing’, so we won’t accept people wearing them. They are just hideous. Party time: Revellers on stag and hen dos are warned to tone down their fancy dress if they want to stay in the town, pictured . Police have reported a reduction in 'hideous' costumes and subsequently a drop in crime in the Cornish resort . 'Is it just me, but if you were living . in Bath for example, or Bournemouth, is that something you would wear . to walk into town on a Saturday afternoon? No. 'They are just revolting, there is . nothing pleasant about seeing anybody in a mankini. We have had a real . crackdown on the fake penises. 'And people are getting that message. You look at the images you see of Newquay now, 2009 is three years ago . and we are in a very different place.' The . tough stance has been part of the award-winning Newquay Safe campaign, . which was launched in the summer of 2009 following the deaths of two . teenagers who died following separate, drink-fuelled nights out in the . town. Residents - many of whom were angry at . Newquay’s apparent descent from a family-friendly holiday destination in . the 1970s to its image as a modern-day Mecca for drinkers - marched on . the council buildings in an impassioned plea to 'take our town back' from the clutches of anti-social tourists. A group of angry parents at Truro County Hall protest over the number of rowdy drunk revellers who fill the streets and bars of Newquay during the summer months . Local residents are delighted that the Cornish resort is shedding its reputation as a haven for drunken revellers as a result of the zero tolerance to risque fancy dress . 'There was a lot of anger, that for us was a real turning point and threw it into sharp focus,' said Supt Whitmarsh. 'It was just the constancy of what was happening, the ongoing situation. I’ve always been shocked at the number of families that come on holiday but don’t all go home as a family. 'To have that number of incidents was a shock for all of those involved. It was a real catalyst for change.' Newquay . Safe drew praise from Home Office ministers for its involvement of . residents, businesses and local authorities, and gave birth to a number . of initiatives designed to cut crime. Police . regularly called parents across Britain to collect their drunken . children in the middle of the night, seizing alcohol and, in some cases, . banning stag and hen parties from going into the resort. Long regarded as a destination for raucous stag and hen parties, Newquay was infamous for groups of boozing teenagers running around the town . 'I remember one of our PCSOs said a 16-year-old boy had 64 cans of super-strength lager at 2pm,' said Supt Whitmarsh. 'But the mother had a real go at the police saying they had ruined the boy’s fun. 'But . it isn’t fun if you see the immediate harm a can of super-strength . lager can cause a 16-year-old, let alone 64 between five of them. 'There is an attitude of ‘what goes on tour, stays on tour’, that that’s ok, but it is not.' And . Superintendent Whitmarsh, the mother of boys aged 14 and 11, said some . parents’ attitudes have contributed to the problems associated with . anti-social behaviour among drunken teenagers. 'You . get adults dropping their children off with, literally, a boot full of . alcohol, and they say: ‘I’d rather know what they are drinking’,' she . said. Save the seaside resort! Newquay was a very difficult place a few years ago but now 'the town is on the cusp of real change' according to Superintendent Whitmarsh . 'Wait - you think they are going to spread that out over the course of a week? It will be gone in the first 36 hours. It is that whole change in culture with parents that I think has been one of the issues.' Superintendent Whitmarsh said some parents have contacted police on the assumption that 'we are providing a baby-sitting service', while others have asked for advice on whether their child is staying in a 'decent' area of town. But officers say the message is finally getting through to many. Reported crime during the summer season fell by one-fifth this year compared with 2009, while reports of anti-social behaviour dropped from 685 in the summer of 2009 to 286 this season. This was partly attributed to additional police officers to work nights in Newquay this summer, as well as long-term schemes bearing fruit. 'Crime is considerably down and the town is on the cusp of real change,' said Supt Whitmarsh. 'You hope that message is getting through. 'It was a very difficult place in 2009. I can understand the fear of crime and anti-social behaviour that the residents had, that is why we have worked very closely with them. 'I think the challenges are to maintain that work and focus to take it forward. We all have a sense of pride in Newquay and the town it wants to become. We won’t shy away from dealing with what needs to be dealt with.'","'Revolting' fancy dress is banned as Newquay police order revelers to cover up .

Residents angry after a 12-year-old boy was charged with setting a fire that leveled three buildings and left 75 people homeless Thursday. Now in custody, the young boy stands accused of intentionally setting a Lewiston, Maine fire April 29 that left no one injured but killed several pets and destroyed two occupied apartment buildings, leaving dozens to try and make sense of it all. One of those confused and displaced tenants is Jessica Marie Foster. Though only just informed of the suspect’s age, Foster wasn’t shy about venting her frustrations. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Blaze: A 12-year-old is charged with arson in the massive fire that destroyed three apartment buildings, one pictured, April 29 in Lewiston, Maine . ‘I was in the middle of packing to move to Boston to start a new life with my husband and make some positive changes and get away from this place I call hell,’ she told the Sun Journal. ‘That too will be put on hold. This little child has taken so much from all of us and I hope he gets the maximum punishment possible!’ And she had even more reason to be angry. Foster also lost her livelihood. ‘This destroyed me, not because the flat-screen TV I [lost], or the computer, or even the clothes and shoes I loved, but drawings and cards my husband had done for me. Not the fact I even lost all my hair tools I had. I graduated from cosmetology school and recently received my temporary cosmetology license, allowing me to work in a salon...that will be on hold now, for I have nothing!’ Blame game: Firefighters put out the flames despite fears they might not contain the massive blaze. Now those who lost everything wonder who to blame when the suspect is a child . Young: Lewiston, Maine Police Chief Michael Bussiere stressed the need to protect the accused due to his age . Some weren’t as quick to place the blame. ‘I am just sad,’ said Katie Hunnefield, another among the displaced. ‘I feel bad for the choices that he chose to make. I think he is old enough to know right from wrong. And I'm sorry but I also have to wonder about the guidance and discipline he has been brought up with. Children should know that there are consequences for one's actions.’ And though it causes shock in some, the boy’s age is also a reason to protect him. Officials will not release his name. Angry: Some affected by the fire felt no remorse from pointing fingers. 'This little child has taken so much from all of us,' said one displaced woman . Which is likely for the best, since previous rumors had swirled that the blaze began after a methamphetamine lab exploded, or due to some other drug activity. ‘I am shocked it would be a 12-year-old boy,’ said Blanche Terjelian, who has friends who lived in the affected buildings. ‘I was informed it was a drug deal gone bad.’ The boy set a fire on a porch behind a condemned apartment building Monday evening, where it spread to that building and two others, authorities said. Victims: 75 were left displaced from the fire and several house pets were killed . Two of the buildings have already been razed, and the third is due to be torn down next week. Police declined to comment on the boy's motives or say whether he lived in the condemned building, also to protect his identity. People were still living in six units even though the building had been condemned a month earlier. The flames were first seen engulfing a back porch. The blaze grew so large that firefighters worried about having enough water pressure, and the plume of smoke could be seen on weather radar 35 miles away in Portland. Totaled: Officials say the boy started the fire on a back porch of a condemned building and it spread. All three buildings will be leveled .","The Lewiston, Maine fire destroyed three apartment buildings, leaving 75 homeless after police say a young boy intentionally started it April 29 ."

Kenneth McKeon, from Plymouth, who has been dubbed 'King Con', was paid the money by Krisis Kids to see if volunteers had a history of sex offences or violence. He gained their confidence by pretending he had a disabled child and that he was suffering cancer. Kenneth Mckeon, pictured, walked free from court today despite a Bebo campaign to warn victims of his cons . But the 43-year-old had no access to the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) and simply pocketed the cash. McKeon has a string of convictions for swindling dozens of victims and charities out of money, Plymouth Crown Court heard. He pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud and was given 200 hours community service. Sentencing him, Judge Paul Darlow said: 'The order I give you is one of unpaid work, 200 on each of these guilty pleas to be completed in 12 months.' McKeon (left arriving at court, and right a picture taken from Bebo) conned Krisis Kids out of £14,000 and raised a total of £47,000 . McKeon was jailed in 2009 after setting up a bogus children's charity that promised to send underprivileged kids on holiday. After raising £47,500 in a series of scams he was labelled a 'persistent and dishonest menace' and jailed for three and a half years. His other scams included a Cardiff-based company called Nationwide Associates that billed homeowners £1,000 for a non-existent speedy sale service. Judge Paul Darlow at Plymouth Crown Court sentenced McKeon to 200 hours of community service . A Bebo page set up in 2010 begged potential victims not to fall for the conman's patter once he was released. It warned: 'This man is a fraudster don't be his next victim.

Romany Blythe called Lady Thatcher a despot and said: ‘They danced in the streets when Hitler died, too’. The 45-year-old – who was given breast implants on the NHS because she complained of low self-esteem – had sparked outrage by creating an internet page called: ‘The witch is dead.’ On it she urged more than 5,000 people to attend a death party in central London on Monday. Miss Blythe, who specialises in teaching troubled children, wrote of Lady Thatcher: ‘Who wants to p*** on her grave?’ Despite the furore caused by her actions, the teacher from Worthing in East Sussex was unrepentant yesterday. ‘People say you shouldn’t speak ill of the dead – but it depends who the dead person is,’ she said. ‘We just don’t want to whitewash what happened when she was prime minister. ‘In normal circumstances celebrating someone’s death would be reprehensible. But we are Generation X, upset people that left school to find hopelessness and despair. ‘She was a despot. They danced in the streets when Hitler died too. Mrs Thatcher was friends with Pinochet. She chose her friends very wisely.’ Miss Blythe attempted to defend her behaviour by claiming she was ‘the voice of reason’. ‘I didn’t do the rioting – I just organised a Facebook page. I’m actually the voice of reason. I didn’t fan the flames. It was a way for us to come together and create unity and solidarity. Breast implants: Teacher Miss Blythe is a member of a workshop company which visits secondary schools . 'There was no other time we could come together as a group and recognise what had happened to us. It was about politics, not about hatred.’ Miss Blythe is a member of a workshop company which visits secondary schools. Yesterday morning, after a risqué picture of her appeared in the Daily Mail, she appeared to be revelling in her notoriety, claiming: ‘The more publicity the bigger the party. I look good in a corset. I know I make Katie Price look like a saint.’ But by the afternoon, amid a growing public backlash over her behaviour, she appeared to have had a change of heart. She closed her Twitter account and increased the privacy settings on her Facebook page. Miss Blythe was given the now-banned PIP breast implants on the NHS in 2000 after suffering from low esteem for years. She has told her local paper that the chemicals in the implants may have caused her to have a miscarriage. Protests: Miss Blythe, who specialises in teaching troubled children, wrote: 'Who wants to p*** on her grave?'

State-run Rossiya-24 television showed footage of the Proton-M booster rocket veering off course seconds after lift-off at the Russian-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan on Tuesday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Russian rocket carrying three navigation satellites worth around $200 million and 600 tonnes of highly toxic fuel exploded into a fireball moments after take-off . It fell apart in flames mid-air and crashed in a ball of fire near the launch pad. 'It seems something is going wrong,' said a television commentator during the live coverage of the launch. 'Something is wrong. It seems it will be a catastrophe'. Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source as saying launch-pad personnel were in bunkers when the rocket lifted off. Explosive: The rocket fell apart in flames mid-air and crashed in a ball of fire near the launch pad . State-run Rossiya-24 television showed footage of the Proton-M booster rocket exploding mid-air . The explosion led to a large spill of heptyl, a highly toxic rocket propellant, but there were no reports of casualties . Russia's space agency Roscosmos said the accident had been caused by the emergency switch-off of the rocket's engines 17 seconds into the flight. Russia's state-run RIA news agency said the switch-off could have been caused by a problem with the engine or the guidance system. The rocket contained 172 tonnes of highly toxic heptyl propellant, Kazakh Emergencies Minister Vladimir Bozhko told an emergency government meeting.

State-run Rossiya-24 television showed footage of the Proton-M booster rocket veering off course . Russia's space agency Roscosmos said the accident had been caused by the emergency switch-off of the rocket's engines 17 seconds into the flight . The Proton-M booster veered off course seconds after lift-off and exploded crashing into a ball of fire . Talgat Musabayev, head of Kazakhstan's space agency Kazcosmos, said nitric oxide - a product of burning heptyl - was much less toxic for humans. It was raining in the area at the time so toxic clouds would probably not reach the town of Baikonur some 38 miles away. A file picture taken on May 15 shows one of the Russia's built unmanned Russian Proton-M carrier rockets rising at a launch pad before its launch . However, the authorities instructed locals to stay at home and not to open windows. They also ordered shops to close, said Kazakh Interior Minister Kalmukhambet Kasymov. The estimated loss from the three satellites, meant for Russia's troubled Glonass satellite navigation system, was about $200 million, Rossiya-24 reported. Russia plans to spend more than 300 billion roubles ($9.1 billion) by 2020 on Glonass, its answer to the U.S. GPS system. The system, first conceived by the Soviet Union more than 40 years ago, has been plagued by failed launches, including one in 2010 in which three satellites were also lost, and by suspicions of corruption and embezzlement. Its chief designer was dismissed last year during a fraud investigation. The Proton rocket, known at the time under its UR-500 code, made its first test flights in the mid-1960s. It was originally designed as an intercontinental ballistic missile to carry a nuclear warhead targeting the Soviet Union's Cold War foe the United States. But it was never deployed as a nuclear weapon. Several crashes of Proton rockets accompanied by spills of heptyl have led to temporary strains in relations between Russia and Kazakhstan. Russia is increasing spending on space and plans to send a probe to the moon in 2015, but the pioneering programme that put the first man in space in 1961 has been plagued in recent years by setbacks, including botched satellite launches and a failed attempt to send a probe to a moon of Mars.","Television footage showed the Proton-M booster rocket veering off-course .

These are the incredible birds eye view photos of Iceland’s extreme landscape - taken from up to 9,000ft in the air. The stunning shots were captured by husband and wife duo Erlend Haarberg, 46, and Orsolya Haarberg, 35, as they soared above the beautiful Nordic nation. The pair scaled mountains, trekked over some of the world’s most rugged terrain and took to the skies in a light aircraft to snap some of the world’s most spectacular scenery. Incredible: The hot spring in Iceland's Fjallabak Nature Reserve which is part of a series of pictures taken from up to 9,000ft in the air . And the beautiful results reveal the drastically contrasting landscapes of Iceland - from explosive volcanoes to Europe’s largest icecap. In one photograph, a fork of sideways lightening sparks out from the Eyjafjallajvkull volcano - which caused travel chaos when it erupted in 2010 - as it explodes into action. Another shot appears to show a tree, but is actually a river delta running into several different streams. Orsolya, from Jakobsli in Norway, who wed . Erlend in 2005 before embarking on the epic photography project, said: . 'Normally I get sick when flying, so I was thankful for the calm . conditions, otherwise I would have been in trouble.

'We had been forced to wait for two months for a day that wasn’t cloudy or raining. So when we woke up and it was sunny we knew we had to get in the air as quick as possible before it changed. 'But it was definitely worth being patient. Iceland’s landscape is so extreme and varied - it makes for such amazing viewing. The colours of the flat landscape really only become visible once you are in the air.' Husband Erlend was charged with taking the extraordinary aerial images while his wife guided the pilot from the back of the light aircraft.

Incredibly, thanks to the poor weather, they covered the whole nation in just one five-hour flight before being forced to return as the fuel ran low. Professional snapper Orsolya, who quit her studies to become a full-time photographer, added: 'It was a tight schedule. One minute we were photographing the erupting Eyjafjallajokull volcano and the next we were over Europe’s largest ice cap, the Vatnajvkull.

The solid gold engagement ring which Napoleon gave to his first wife Josephine has sold at auction for £660,000 - nearly 50 times its list price. The historic jewellery went under the hammer at Osenat’s in central Paris yesterday and was bought by a mystery businessman. The 18th Century ring contains two pear-shaped stones, a blue sapphire and a diamond, and each gem weights one carat. Bonaparte's bling: The engagement ring given to Josephine by Napoleon fetched £660,000 at auction . Amour: Napoleon, left, married Josephine, right, in 1796 but divorced her because she could not have children . Historic jewellery: The ring attracted international interest and was sold for nearly 50 times the list price . The auction was held in honour of the 250th anniversary of the birth of Joséphine de Beauharnais, who become the Empress of France after marrying Napoleon Bonaparte. Auction house spokeswoman Emily . Villane said: 'Not in my wildest dreams did I think we would outsell the . estimate by more than 47 times. 'We based the estimates in our catalogue on the actual market value of the ring, minus the connection with Napoleon and Josephine.' Around 300 people were at the auction house when the ring was sold, with approximately 50 bidders from around the world taking part over the phone. The auctioneers set up additional phone lines and hired an extra 10 staff to cope with the demand. It also received more than 40 written bids, sent by email to the auctioneers from the United States. Ms Villane said the bidding was 'relentless', having opened at 10,000 euros and then being raised to 50,000 euros. She added: 'From then on it was going up by 10,000. When the hammer went down at 730,000 euros there was huge applause.' Under the hammer: A sword given by Henry IV to Jean d'Harambure was also sold at the auction in Paris yesterday . Landmark occasion: The auction marked the 250th anniversary of the birth of Joséphine de Beauharnais . Unusually . for the time, Josephine was a widow with a son and a daughter when she . married history’s most famous Frenchman on March 9, 1796. Her . first husband, Alexandre, had been beheaded following the French . Revolution and within a few years had become Napoleon's mistress. She had been known as Rose until meeting the general, but adopted Josephine, the name Napoleon preferred to call her. Napoleon left just days after the wedding to fight in Italy and wrote a series of love letters to his wife. In one of the letters he said . Josephine 'alone can move and rule' his heart, but such affection turned . to anger when news reached him of his wife's affair with Hussar . lieutenant Hippolyte Charles. Napoleon went on to have numerous . affairs of his own and divorced Josephine in 1810 because she was unable . to have anymore children and the Emperor was determined to have an . heir.

Two young women found dead in mysterious circumstances are feared to have fallen victim to a deadly batch of party drugs nicknamed 'Dr Death', police revealed today. Oil rig worker Rachel Clayton and her partner Emma Speed were discovered at their home in Macclesfield earlier this month after a friend went to check up on them. It was initially believed that the women, who had been carrying out renovation work, may have succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning, but that possibility was soon ruled out. Now toxicology tests have revealed that the victims had PMA, a drug similar to ecstasy, in their system at the time of their death. Casualties: Rachel Clayton, left, and Emma Speed, right, died after taking a dangerous party drug . The discovery has prompted urgent warnings over the dangers of the drugs, as a 34-year-old men found dead in a caravan in Macclesfield in February also had traces of PMA in his body. 'While we would always urge people not to take any illegal substances, I am particularly keen to emphasise the dangers and potentially life threatening consequences of PMA,' said Ruth Purdie of Cheshire Police. 'We have now had three deaths in Cheshire which appear to be linked to the drug and therefore I feel I have a duty to warn people about the potentially fatal consequences taking this drug can have. 'It is our duty to join up with our colleagues in the health service and make as many people as possible aware of the risk this drug poses and to do all we can to ensure no one dies and prevent further heartache for any more families. 'If anyone has any information about who is supplying this drug across Cheshire I would urge them to contact police or Crimestoppers anonymously so we can respond to this potential risk and take them off the streets.' Killer: PMA, known as 'Dr Death', has been linked to a number of deaths of young people in recent months . Earlier this year, the sudden deaths of 20-year-old Charlotte Woodiwiss and four young men were also linked to a deadly batch of PMA. The drug is often shaped like a Love Heart, and is known as 'Dr Death, 'Pink Ecstasy', 'Mitsubishi Turbos' or 'Pink McDonalds', although its scientific name is para-Methoxyamphetamine. The pills are the same size and shape as an ecstasy tablet, are usually pink or white and often have the letter 'M' printed on them. It is sold to clubbers for as little as £3 a pill - dealers claim it offers a similar high to ecstasy, but it is five times as strong and can cause the body temperature to rise dangerously. In addition, because it takes effect relatively slowly, revellers sometimes take multiple pills to speed up its effect. Investigation: Police outside the house in Macclesfield where the couple were discovered on April 7 . Janet Clowes, who sits on Cheshire Council, said: 'The risks from taking potentially contaminated and unregulated drugs are very high. 'If you are concerned about someone you know who may be at risk or want help for yourself there are a number of services in Cheshire East which can help. 'You can access free confidential advice and information as well as the different types of treatment options that are available to you.' Ms Clayton, 34, and Ms Speed, 30, were found inside their terraced house on April 7 by a friend who had a key to the home. The former was on a short break from her job working on an oil rig in the North Sea, and had been proudly showing off her new Volkswagen Scirocco. She had recently posted on Facebook: 'Home tomoz thank didily I'm becoming a recluse after 3 weeks in the North Sea' [sic]. In a statement Ms Clayton's parents Malcolm and Sue said: 'Rachel enjoyed life to the full. She was a special daughter and was very family orientated. We will miss her greatly.' Ms Speed's family said: 'She had a good heart and would do anything for anyone.'","Rachel Clayton, 34, and Emma Speed, 30, found dead earlier this month .

Controversial prime minister Silvio Berlusconi today insisted he was a religious man and that his infamous 'bunga bunga' parties were a figment of 'porn obsessed judges'. Berlusconi, 75, also said that 'bunga bunga' was 'nothing more than a dance' and added that 'he had never taken part' in parties held at his house where prosecutors say dozens of women were recruited and were paid for sex. The politician is accused of having sex with an underage prostitute at one of the parties where women were also said to have dressed as nuns, before performing raunchy stripteases and pole dances - allegedly rubbing crucifixes between their breasts. However media tycoon Berlusconi insisted the parties at his home in Arcore near Milan were nothing more than elegant dinners and he was a victim of left leaning prosecutors who were out to get him and oust him from power. He said: 'There was no sacrilegious behaviour at my house. This has all been invented by porn-obsessed prosecutors. 'It's all the work of the fevered imagination of prosecutors and journalists. 'My religious life is not just a . church in my home at Arcore where my family has celebrated baptisms, . marriages and funerals and the prayers of eight aunts who are nuns. Nightclub dancer Karima El Mahroug (left) and escort girl Patrizia D'Addario have been named in connection with sex parties allegedly held by Berlusconi . 'My . roots are strengthened by my Christian and human values that have been . with me since I grew up with my family and attended a school run by .

'These are precious values which for me are not negotiable. 'Can you imagine if I would allow any sort of blasphemous behaviour in my house ?' Berlusconi also insisted the words 'bunga bunga' which have entered global phraseology, refer to dancing that took place at his parties. He said: 'When one of my guests said ""Are we going to have some bunga bunga after dinner?"" they were just talking about dancing. I never took part because I have vowed never to dance. Sabina Began, said to the 'queen bee' of Berlusconi's girls, allegedly recruited three women for a party he hosted in Rome . 'I have not smoked since I managed to . save my first business adventure from an inglorious ending and I don't . gamble since I risked making a fool of myself with a professional card . player and I don't dance since I promised a friend who was dying, that . if they lived I would not dance again'. Berlusconi spoke out just hours ahead of the resumption of his corruption trial in Milan in which he is accused of paying David Mills, the estranged husband of former Labour Cabinet Minister Tessa Jowell, $600,000 in return for giving favourable evidence in previous trials. Company lawyer Mr Mills will give his evidence via video link in London . and Berlusconi has already confirmed he will attend the hearing and may . even speak out insisting that he has 'never met Mills in my life'.

A young graduate whose brothers are serving prison sentences for planning a terrorist attack on the London Stock Exchanged, has been jailed for downloading Al-Qaeda terrorist material in her mobile phone. Ruksana Begum, 22, who has a first-class degree in accountancy, had two editions of Al-Qaeda's Inspire magazine on her phone, including articles such as 'Targeting the populations of countries that are at war with the Muslims'. Ms Begum's brothers, Gurukanth Desai, 30, and Abdul Miah, 25, were sentenced to 12 and 16 years respectively for their part in a plot to attack the London Stock Exchange, The Old Bailey heard today. Brothers: Ms Begum claimed to have downloaded the editions of Al-Qaeda's 'Inspire' magazine to understand the convictions of her brothers Gurukanth Desai, 30, left, and Abdul Malik Miah, 25, right . Ms Begum had just married when she moved to the capital in June, a mere month before anti-terrorist officers raided an address where she was staying in east London. Ms Begum, who lived in Cardiff with her family prior to her marriage, was sentenced to one year in prison today, having plead guilty last month to possessing material which was likely to be useful to someone committing or preparing an act of terrorism. Ms Begum, of north London, appeared with only her eyes visible beneath a black veil to be sentenced after being remanded in Holloway prison. Kate Wilkinson, prosecuting, said: 'These items contained both instructional and ideological material. The magazines are in English and are targeted at Muslims living in the West. ‘They contain two types of material: firstly, material which is designed to make the reader support, fund, or join the Jihad, and particularly to encourage the Western reader to attack the nation where he lives. ‘Secondly, the magazines provide practical guidance on how to commit acts of terrorism.’ So badly decomposed: Judge Gerald Gordon told Beddoe at Old Bailey (pictured) that because Mr Corey's body was found 11 days after his death, the cause of death could not be established causing 'further distress to the family... the concealment of a murder demands a significant sentence' A paper copy of the South Wales Echo . newspaper, whose front page on February 2 this year announced the . conviction of her brothers of terrorist offences, was also found when police raided the London address. Forensic experts analysed the contents of the memory card on Ms Begum's mobile phone and found it contained two copies of Al-Qaeda propaganda magazine ‘Inspire’, along with traces of other literature that had been deleted. Abdul Miah, 25, was jailed for 16 years and 10 months and Gurukanth Desai, 30, for 12 years after they pleaded guilty to the plot at Woolwich Crown Court in February this year. They were part of a group of nine al-Qaeda inspired terrorists who planned to blow up the London Stock Exchange during a Christmas bomb blitz. Other potential targets for 'Mumbai style' attacks included the London Eye, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, The Palace of Westminster, and the home address of Mayor Boris Johnson.Cardiff brothers Desai and Miah had previously tested a pipe bomb after reading Inspire which contained a recipe 'Make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom'. Issue 8 included an article entitled: ‘Targeting the populations of countries that are at war with the Muslims’, alongside interviews of Al-Qaeda recruits. It also showed readers how to use handguns, along with a guide on how to convert motorbike alarms into remote control detonators for explosives. The following issue lists ‘important enemy targets’ in the US and other Western countries, including stock exchanges, airports, famous people, and ‘anywhere where Jews gather’. Included in the magazine are instructions on how to start wildfires by using a timer from a washing machine to help build an ‘ember bomb’. The court heard the Forensic Explosives Laboratory, a division of the Ministry of Defence, had analysed the instructions and concluded they were ‘accurate and relatively easy to follow.’ Burkha clad Begum was jailed at the . Old Bailey today but has been on remand for 141 days and could be free . in just under six weeks. Hossein Zahir, defending, said Begum . downloaded the material a few weeks before the raid because she wanted to . understand why her brothers had taken the path they had. He said: 'She was confident that her brothers were innocent and they would be acquitted. Then they pleaded guilty. 'She accessed this material, which is . easily accessible, before coming to London to understand the background . and ideology which led to her brothers' incarceration. 'She is an intelligent and articulate young woman who does not share the views of others who do not care.' Terrorist plot: Ms Begum's two brothers were jailed in February this year after pleading guilty to part-taking in planning a terrorist bomb attack on the London Stock Exchange . Judge Mr Justice Fulford called Ms Begum a 'good Muslim' and said there was nothing to suggest that Begum was herself involved in terrorist activity. He added: 'Instead, this defendant with other members of her family, was devastated by the arrest and later imprisonment of her brothers for serious terrorist offences. 'The family, which was previously respected in the community where they lived in Cardiff, were ostracised. Mr Justice Fulford said he accepted that Ms Begum had downloaded the magazines in order to explore and understand the charges which her brothers faced, but that material which can aid a terrorist and serious offences will always carry a prison sentence.

An American student who was leading friends up Mount Snowdon slipped and plunged 500ft to his death off an icy ridge. Jared Maillet, 21, volunteered to go first across the ridge in an endurance challenge but his fellow climbers could only watch in horror as he fell. The exchange student was taking part in a race to climb all of the peaks above 3,000ft in 24 hours in Snowdonia, North Wales. A Sea King search and rescue helicopter . was called from RAF Valley in Anglesey - where Prince William works as a . rescue pilot - but it was too late. Jarred, from Maine, US, was studying sustainability and urban planning at Arizona State University. He was an exchange student studying at . Manchester University when he started exploring the peaks in nearby . Snowdonia and the Yorkshire Dales. His heartbroken sister Christie, 23, said: 'He was with his hiking group, and decided to take the lead - because that is what he does. He slipped on a patch of ice and he fell off of a cliff. 'I don't like thinking about how he died, so I am thinking of it this way - he took the lead because he is a leader. 'He potentially saved someone else from slipping off that cliff. I'd like to think he passed out immediately and felt no pain or fear. 'The only comforting thing is that he was not cold and alone. He was loved by so many people, and no one will forget him. I hope we all can live like he did. 'He was such a goddamn good and happy person.' Jared's body was found on Saturday by other walkers on a ridge at 2,500ft near a precarious route known as Parson's Nose. Adventurer: The student, 21, from Arizona State University was an exchange student at Manchester University . His Facebook page shows Jared as a fun-loving young man who loved being out in the elements. Alongside a picture of him sitting in front of a snowy mountain landscape he wrote: 'I sat there for a few minutes at the edge of that drop off and was getting blasted by winds. 'I was seriously just dumbstruck by the scale, beauty, and rawness of the landscape.' Another striking image shows the young student balancing on the top of a peak with the comment: 'Pretty wicked winds up there.' To complete the Welsh 3000 challenge people have to reach the top of all 15 mountains over 3000ft in Wales within the space of 24 hours, without using any form of transport. Accident spot: Parson's Nose on Mount Snowdon which is near where the accident happened. The student fell from a ridge which was covered in ice . Explorer: Jared Maillet, 21, from Maine, US, was trying to complete the Welsh 3000 challenge where people have to reach the top of all 15 mountains over 3000ft in Wales within the space of 24 hours . Tragedy: The student fell to his death while climbing Snowdon in North Wales . The 30-mile hike is described on the challenge website as 'extremely tough' and 'only suitable for very fit and experienced mountain walkers'. The Welsh 3000 website warns walkers: 'Navigation can also be problematic without previous knowledge of this area of Snowdonia. 'Additionally, one mountain, Crib Goch, is very exposed - several people have died on it. 'This challenge is often underestimated - you need to be very fit to walk it in 24 hours.' Arizona State University is today helping return Jared's body to the USA for a family funeral. His sister Christie said: 'Jared and I had actually discussed not too long ago that both of us wanted to be 'turned into trees' when we passed away. 'There are biodegradable urns that contain tree seeds which you can plant and have eventually grow into a tree. 'Jared was completely into this idea. He didn't want to be buried in a coffin, he wanted to be a tree, and a tree he will be.'

The young lover of France's under-fire Socialist finance minister has leapt to his defence as his government's tax dodging scandal intensifies. In an often hilarious interview with her local paper, Marie-Charline Pacquot, 25, describes herself as 57-year-old Pierre Moscovici's 'lighthouse in a storm'. She not only lashes out at his critics, but - in an attempt to prove how modest they are - describes quiet nights in 'watching westerns' with their cat, 'Hamlet'. Marie-Charline Pacquot, 25, describes herself as 57-year-old Pierre Moscovici's 'lighthouse in a storm' in an interview with Le Pays . Miss Pacquot's words provide a fascinating insight into the influence France's notoriously amorous male politicians have with their frequently much younger girlfriends. Many have accused Mr Moscovici's left-wing government of utter hypocrisy, especially since budget minister, Jerome Cahuzac, was charged with tax evasion last week. Mr Moscovici is now accused of having known about Cahuzac's secret Swiss account since December - a claim he denies. Miss Pacquot, who was a philosophy student when she first started going out with the minister around five years ago and is now a researcher, told Le Pays (The Country) that attacks on politicians like Mr Moscovici were unwarranted. 'It is hard that he becomes a victim when there is a crisis like this,' she said. 'I see how he suffers by proxy. 'I am also terribly surprised by the number of lies that are told about him, and it breaks my heart. 'But at times like this it is important to be together. He has often told me that I am a lighthouse in the storm.' Miss Pacquot says she has 'always liked being surrounded by older people' adding that she 'pays no attention' to the age gap, unless he mentions attending a rock concert by The Who 'in 1972'. She says the couple lead a 'normal . life' - 'going to a restaurant or watching old westerns on DVD with our . cat Hamlet on our knees'. Francois . Hollande, France's president, has a live-in lover, Valerie Trierweiler, . who is more than a decade younger than him, while his predecessor, . Nicolas Sarkozy, married his lover, former supermodel Carla Bruni, while . in office. The interview gives an insight into the influence of younger women on France's male politicians.

Many high-profile business leaders have left France since Mr Hollande's government came to power last year, and the economy is in crisis, with both unemployment and the cost of living spiralling.","Marie-Charline Pacquot gave interview to Le Pays newspaper .

Operators of Japan's stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant lost the ability to cool radioactive fuel rods in one of its reactors for three hours today after workers tripped the power supply while trying to ward off rats. It was the second failure of the system to circulate seawater to cool spent fuel rods at the plant in the past three weeks. Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) said it was alerted by an alarm that the cooling system for the No 3 reactor had shut down at around 2.27pm (5.27am GMT) after a power board failed. Safety alert: Workers at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant lost the ability to cool fuel rods in reactor 3 (seen here after the earthquake in 2011) after tripping the power supply while setting up a rat trap . Crippled: The plant was the site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in March 2011 when a magnitude-9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed back-up generators at Fukushima . Technicians fixed the problem by about 5.20pm, the utility said. Tepco said workers appeared to have had inadvertently caused the power outage when they were trying to install a net to keep small animals from crawling into the reactor building. A rat caused a power outage at Fukushima last month when it triggered a circuit breaker by bumping into exposed wires. In that case, the cooling system was shut down for almost a day. Workers appeared to have had inadvertently caused the power outage when they were trying to install a net to keep small animals from crawling into the reactor building .

Pledge: Business Minster Michael Fallon said the share handout will be ¿as attractive as possible¿ . Every postal worker in Britain will be given around £1,500 of shares in Royal Mail when it floats on the stock market, the Business Minister will say today. It will be the largest employee share scheme for 25 years with around 140,000 workers from postmen to local delivery office managers expected to scoop a windfall. In his first speech on the controversial privatisation of the country’s postal service, Michael Fallon will today pledge to make the share handout ‘as attractive as possible.’ He is keen the share handout is structured in a way that all postal workers benefit, rather than just allowing the executives to walk away with millions. But he will warn the militant postal union, the Communication Workers Union, that they must ‘engage’ with the Government - or the deal could be scuppered. The CWU is bitterly opposed to the privatisation of Royal Mail, a deal which it fears will lead to price rises, pay cuts and the destruction of the service. In a protest against the privatisation plans, the union is currently plotting to boycott the handling of any mail which has not been sent through Royal Mail, but one of its rivals, such as TNT. Speaking at think-tank Policy Exchange today, Mr Fallon will call on the CWU to ‘put ideology aside’ so that their members ‘do not lose out.’  He will say: ‘I am determined to do the right deal for them. ‘Royal Mail employees spend their working lives making the post run on time, delivering to far flung parts of the country from Lands End to John O’Groats. They are absolutely central to the future success of the company.’ Under the proposals, the Government has promised to give ten per cent of the company to its workers when it is privatised. A stock market flotation is Mr Fallon’s preferred option, and a deal valuing the company at between £2billion and £3billion is expected to take place before April 2014. Workers' windfall: The Communication Workers Union are opposed to the whole privitisation but Mr Fallon has told the union it must engage with the deal . But a major sticking point for the union surrounds whether the shares are given to postmen for free, or are sold at a discounted price. In today’s speech, Mr Fallon is not expected to make clear which option is on the table. They should also get extra cash from the shares, known as a dividend, every six months. He will say: ‘People should be in no doubt, whether the shares are discounted, or free, it is a hugely significant commitment from the Government to Royal Mail’s workers.’ Union bosses have already made clear their trenchant opposition to a deal which would require postmen to pay even a penny for the shares. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the CWU, said: ‘The idea that postal workers are going to sell their soul for a ten per cent stake in the company is not going to work. Union trouble: Frances O'Grady the General Secretary of the TUC has warned that privatising the Royal Mail would be a 'disaster' ‘Even less so if the Government expects postal workers to put up their own cash in order to buy shares. ‘Postal workers know that . privatisation would mean the break-up of the company, more job losses, . worse terms and conditions and attacks on their pensions. ‘It . would be a wrecking ball to the industry they work in. Why would they . sign up to that for a one-off share-scheme when their pay, conditions . and job security for their rest of their career could be badly affected . by the consequences?’ Anybody from families to pensioners will be allowed to subscribe for shares in the Royal Mail flotation. It . is too early to say how much they will cost or how many shares people . will be able to buy in the company which has throughout its history had . just one shareholder - the Government. Royal Mail has been gearing up for . privatisation for months, a deal which Margaret Thatcher refused to do . saying she was ‘not prepared to have the Queen’s head privatised.’ Its . £12billion pension black hole has been dumped on the taxpayer, and a . first-class stamp has jumped from 46p to 60p after the regulator . scrapped the limited on how much it can be increased each year.","140,000 workers from postmen to managers expected to scoop a windfall .

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 12:52 EST, 30 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:53 EST, 30 April 2013 . Body dysmorphic disorder is caused by ‘bad wiring’ in the brain, according to new research. Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles have discovered that people with the psychiatric disorder have abnormal network wiring patterns across their entire brain. They also possess abnormal connections between regions of the brain involved in visual and emotional processing. Body dysmorphic disorder is characterised by an obsession with bodily flaws, and researchers think brain abnormalities may be to blame . This is thought to explain why they perceive themselves as disfigured and ugly, even though they look normal to others. ‘We found a strong [link] between low efficiency of connections across the whole brain and the severity of body dysmorphic disorder,’ Dr Jamie Feusner said. ‘The less efficient the patients' brain connections, the worse the symptoms, particularly for compulsive behaviours, such as checking mirrors,’ he added. People suffering from the condition tend to fixate on minutest details, such as a single blemish on their face, rather than viewing themselves in their entirety. Patients can become so distressed with their appearance that they are unable to lead normal lives. The condition is thought to affect over 120,000 British people. In the study, Dr Feusner and his colleagues performed brain scans on 14 adults diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and on 16 healthy adults. BDD is an anxiety disorder related to a person's physical appearance. Sufferers spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and have a distorted view of how they look. It is thought to affect over 120,000 people in the UK. It is more common in those with a history of depression and is often teamed with  OCD, generalised anxiety disorder or an eating disorder such as anorexia. The cause of BDD is not clear, but it may be genetic or caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, such as this new study suggests. Treatment usually involves a combination of antidepressants and talking therapy. The goal of the study was to map the brain's connections and examine how the white matter networks are organised. To do this, they used a sensitive form of brain imaging that can measure the quality of the brain's white matter. From these scans, they were able to create whole brain ‘maps’ . Next, they used advanced technology to characterise the patterns of connections throughout the brains of people with BDD and then compared them with those of the healthy people. The researchers found that those with BDD had abnormally high network ‘clustering’ across the entire brain. This suggests that sufferers may not process information correctly. The researchers also discovered specific abnormal connections between areas involved in processing visual input - what they see -  and those involved in recognising emotions. ‘How their brain regions are connected in order to communicate about what they see and how they feel is disturbed,’ explained Dr Feusner. Another recent study has suggested eating disorders such as anorexia are linked to brain function . ‘This could affect how they perceive their physical appearance and may also result in them getting caught up in the details of other thoughts and cognitive processes.’ The news comes after another study revealed that people with anorexia have a ‘connection error’ in their brain which makes them think they are overweight when they are not. Researchers at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany studied the brain regions that become active when people see pictures of bodies. They asked ten anorexic and 15 healthy women of a similar age to judge which of several different silhouettes corresponded best to their own body shape. Ten control subjects who did not participate in the MRI scan answered the same question by matching a photo of the test subject to the right silhouette. Scientists found that while healthy subjects rated themselves as thinner than the control subjects, those with the eating disorder perceived themselves to be fatter than the control subjects did. The team then recorded the brain activity of the 25 participants using MRI scanners, while they observed photos of bodies. They analysed the activity in the 'fusiform body area' and the 'extrastriate body area' in the left hemisphere of the brain. Previous studies have shown that these regions are critical for how people process images of bodies. They found the connection between the two regions, which process body images, was weaker among anorexic women than in healthy women. The more prominent this 'connection error' was, the more overweight the respondents considered themselves to be.","Study linked Body Dysmorphic Disorder to 'abnormal brain connections'

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 10:10 EST, 6 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:25 EST, 6 December 2012 . Women who are pregnant with their first child or mothers planning to have another baby are among the biggest losers in the mini-Budget. Labour yesterday accused the Chancellor of slapping a £180 ‘Mummy Tax’ on women. In his Autumn Statement, George Osborne revealed plans to limit the annual increase in most benefits to just one per cent per year for the next three years. Losing out: Nicola Marshall, pictured with daughter Lily-May, 8 . Nicola Marshall, 35, will lose out when child benefits and child tax credits are increased by a maximum of just 1 per cent. The single mother, pictured with . daughter Lily-May, eight, claims £83 a month in child benefit and £131 . in working and child tax credits. She earns £589 working 16 hours a . week as an office manager in Ightham, Kent, but cannot work more hours . or else she would lose her housing benefit of £586. She can hardly afford her utility . bills of £100 a month, her rent is £825 a month and she still has to . find £100 for council tax and £240 for food. Miss Marshall said: ‘It’s . becoming impossible to survive. I have no spare money. I am £12 . overdrawn in my account. For the past month I have not been able to do a . proper food shop. ‘If they’re not moving things in line with inflation it’s going to be impossible.’ While giving the impression the move . would largely affect the jobless, he failed to mention it will also hit . statutory maternity pay. At present, a mother is paid 90 per . cent of her salary for the first six weeks of her maternity leave . followed by £135.45 per week for the following 33 weeks. Typically, the weekly amount is increased every April by the previous September’s consumer prices index measure of inflation. This would have led to a 2.2 per cent rise, equal to around £3 a week. But under the new system, it will rise by only £1.35. Yvette Cooper, Labour’s spokesman on . women, said: ‘New mums are paying a heavy price for George Osborne’s . economic failure. This real terms cut in maternity pay is effectively a . £180 Mummy Tax on working women – and it’s bad for the whole family.’ A lower rate of maternity pay is likely to push some women back to work when they would prefer to be bonding with their infant. Labour predict maternity pay will be £180 lower for the 33-week period in 2015 than it would have been. Fathers will also be hit because the . smaller annual rise will affect statutory paternity pay, which is paid . for two consecutive weeks at the same rate as the mother receives. Parents will also see a rise of just one per cent in their child benefit when the three-year freeze ends in 2014. Since April 2011, child benefit has . been stuck at a rate of £20.30 per week for the first child and £13.40 . per week for each subsequent child. VIDEO: Chancellor introduces controversial 'mummy tax' in Autumn Statement . For parents with one child, this is the equivalent of an extra 20p a week – the average price of a nappy. Alison Garnham, chief executive of . Child Poverty Action Group, said: ‘Despite all the talk, working . families are once again at the front of the queue for spending cuts.’ Overall, Labour says women are . picking up the bill for £867million of the £1billion of new direct tax, . tax credit and benefit changes in the Autumn Statement. Other cuts to hit families since the . Coalition came to power in 2010 include the loss of the £250 child trust . fund voucher, which used to be paid to all babies, and a £190 health in . pregnancy grant designed to help women keep fit and eat well. Mr Osborne used his Autumn Statement . yesterday to announce he was scrapping the link between working age . benefits and inflation, after welfare handouts rose by twice the rate of . average wages. In the . Commons he emphasised the need to target the jobless, saying he had to . be 'fair to the person who leaves home every morning to go out to work . and sees their neighbour still asleep, living a life on benefits'. But the one per cent rise will also hit several benefits received by people in work, including income support and housing benefit. Both maternity and paternity pay will be subject to a below inflation rise for three years from next April. Some of the 232,000 women who claim maternity pay every year will be hit, along with 59,000 who claim Maternity Allowance instead. Tough cuts: Child benefit, maternity and paternity pay will rise below inflation for the next three years, Chancellor George Osborne announced . Details of the effective cut were sneaked out in the small print of the Autumn Statement. Statutory Maternity Pay is paid by employers when women take time off to have a baby. It is paid for 39 weeks, with the . first six weeks at 90 per cent of usual salary and then 33 weeks at . £135.45 a week. From April, the amount will increase by just £1.35 a . week rather than the index-linked rate of around £3. The same rate is paid under Maternity . Allowance, which is awarded to those who do not qualify for statutory . maternity pay – often nannies and those who are pregnant when they take a . new job. Expectant mothers can claim the allowance as soon as they have been pregnant for 26 weeks. Labour Treasury spokesman Catherine . McKinnell said: ‘In the Budget the small print was the granny tax and in . the Autumn Statement the hidden detail was George Osborne’s mummy tax. ‘They are hitting millions of working families and mums taking a break from their job to look after their newborn baby. And all on the same day that millionaires get an average tax cut of over £100,000.’ Yesterday the Chancellor said the long freeze will end in two years’ time, but he will reward families with a rise of only 1 per cent for the following two years. Autumn Statement: Mr Osborne admitted higher government borrowing and lower-than-expected economic growth meant spending cuts and tax rises designed to balance the books would have to be extended by an extra year, to 2018 . For the second child, the rise is equal to just 13p a week. George Osborne’s decision was criticised by experts who said the paltry increase will hurt families at a time when millions are struggling to make ends meet. Child benefit, typically paid to the mother, is relied upon by families to balance their stretched budget, from helping to pay for their weekly food shop to buying a child’s new shoes. Until the Coalition came to power in May 2010, it used to increased generously each year, with the rise linked to the retail prices index measure of inflation. But the three-year freeze followed by two years of tiny rises has wiped out the spending power of child benefit, leaving a black hole in the family budget. Some elements of the complicated child tax credit payments will also rise by only 1 per cent for three years from April 2013. A spokesman for the StepChange Debt Charity said: ‘Family budgets have been put under extreme strain in recent years. Stagnant wages and rising living costs are pushing more families towards financial breaking point. ‘The changes to child benefit will hit many families at a point when they are already struggling to make ends meet.’ Child benefit, which used to be paid to every family with young children in Britain, has already become embroiled in controversy. From January 7, families with at least one parent earning more than £50,000 will lose some of the benefit. It is being axed completely for those with at least one earner on more than £60,000. Around 1.2million families will be affected by the move, but yesterday’s announcement by the Chancellor means those families who still get child benefit are now under attack as well. Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘This Chancellor has presided over one of the biggest ever squeezes on the budgets of working families. ‘Small gains on fuel and the personal allowance are dwarfed by the swingeing cuts to child benefit and tax credits that many millions of families rely on to get by. For all the Westminster talk of fiscal rules and  structural deficits, it is money at home that matters to  families, and that’s where they’ve been hit harder than anyone else.’ Robin Williamson, technical director of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, described the rise as ‘not generous’.","George Osborne revealed plans to limit increase in benefits to just 1pc .

Taser shootings will soon be captured on camera in a bid to quell growing concern about the potentially deadly weapons. Police chiefs believe the footage will provide vital evidence after controversial incidents such as the death of ‘human fireball’ Andrew Pimlott in Plymouth. They are preparing to trial the high-tech digital cameras which can be worn on glasses, body armour or the Taser itself. This video from the New South Wales Ombudsman shows a man with his hands on his head before apparently being Tasered by Australian police officers . But In Australia, an independent . watchdog discovered police simply ignored damning material captured . during a string of shootings. Government scientists have already visited several overseas forces where they found they provide compelling footage. But critics questioned whether police . will try and cover-up video evidence that illustrates abuse of the . 50,000-volt weapons. In . Australia, the cameras caught officers as they repeatedly Tasered a . disabled man who refused to get out of bed and a suicidal man in a . police cell who fell heavily on to concrete. The Australian Taser footage, filmed in New South Wales, provides disturbing evidence of how the weapons can be misused . After apparently being Tasered the topless man collapses on the floor. Simon Chesterman, the most senior officer responsible for Tasers and firearms in the UK, said he is 'keen' to investigate the use of cameras . Simon Chesterman, the most senior officer responsible for Tasers and firearms nationwide, said he is ‘keen’ to investigate the use of cameras. The West Mercia deputy chief constable said advances in technology could make them a useful tool to protect officers and the public. He said: ‘The technology has moved on and there are now products that officers can wear that appear to work much better. ‘It is as much about public accountability as protecting the officers themselves and supporting them. ‘I am interested in offering frontline officers better protection. By that I do not just mean physically but in terms of the law as well. ‘We have a duty to explore this. We did it before and it came to nothing because of the poor quality. ‘But we have moved on as far as technology is concerned and it is certainly worth exploring again.’ Andrew Pimlott burned to death outside his home in Plymouth when officers used a Taser on him after he doused himself in petrol . The death of Andrew Pimlott, 32, has thrown the use of Tasers, by police officers with just three days of training, back to the top of the agenda. He died from horrific burns last week, several days after one was fired at him after he doused himself in fuel in his back garden. The Met is one of the first forces likely to trial the cameras as 1,200 extra officers are being trained to wield stun guns. The move reflects a national trend in which many forces are increasing the number of Taser officers amid fears for their safety. The Police Federation wants every officer to be armed with a Taser by increasing the number to around 32,000 - enough for every officer on duty. Police prefer body-worn cameras because gun-mounted versions would mean the weapon is pointed constantly at the subject. But some frontline representatives are worried the cameras will present a ‘one sided’ version of events that does not catch the build-up to any violent encounters. The Australian Taser footage, filmed in New South Wales, provides disturbing evidence of how the weapons can be misused. The police ombudsman found that Tasers were not used appropriately during one in seven confrontations, including when suspects were already handcuffed. In one, a disabled man is Tasered three times after he refused to get out of bed to be arrested and cowers behind a pillow crying: ‘Stop it please.’ In another, a suspected thief is zapped as he knelt on the floor with his hands behind his head as he calmly told police: ‘I’ve done nothing wrong.’ And dramatic footage shows a drink driving suspect being brought down and then shocked repeatedly as he attempted to run up a flight of stairs. London politician Caroline Pidgeon, who oversees the work of the Met, welcomed the forthcoming camera trials. She said: ‘As Tasers can be used inappropriately with horrifying consequences it is vital that basic checks are in place to ensure their use is constantly monitored. ‘A good start would be the routine provision of cameras connected to every Taser so ensuring that recorded video footage is always available for every incident when they are used.’ WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . The Met is one of the first forces likely to trial the cameras as 1,200 extra officers are being trained to wield stun guns . Nick Pickles, director of the Big Brother . Watch campaign group, said he would be concerned about the release of . more cameras on the streets. He said: ‘This is a one-sided tool. How would police officers react if members of the public routinely filmed them?’ One of the most popular cameras, which clips on to glasses, helmets or hats, is already used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies across the US. The device, which is made by the same company as the Taser, constantly captures the last 30 seconds which can be saved by pressing a button. An overdue report on Taser use to be published within weeks is expected to reveal a huge rise in their use. According to research by the Daily Mail, Tasers were fired at suspects at least 1,081 times in 2011, compared with just 744 in 2010. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .","Police believe footage will .

Ravinder Kaur, 34, is charged with administering a 'poison or noxious substance with intent' after she allegedly put mercury amalgam - a substance used in dental fillings - into a cup of coffee . The boss of a dental nurse was admitted to hospital and suffered from seizures three days after she tried to poison her with mercury intended for fillings, a court heard today. Ravinder Kaur, 34, is charged with administering a 'poison or noxious substance with intent' after she allegedly put mercury amalgam - a substance used in dental fillings - into a cup of coffee she made for Laura Knowles. Assistant dental nurse Kaur, who denies the charge, is accused of slipping the substance into Ms Knowles’ cup of coffee at a dental practice in Shefford, Bedfordshire, on Friday March 16 last year. Ms Knowles, 36, the practice manager at the Shams Moopen Dental Practice, suffered with what she described as 'severe period pains' initially. But her symptoms worsened, and Ms Knowles told the jury that over the weekend she had bouts of dizziness, diarrhoea and vomiting. On her return to work on Monday, Ms Knowles had to be hospitalised due to having a seizure - 'the type people suffer when they have an epileptic fit', according to Rupert Bowers, defending. She also lost consciousness. Ms Knowles told the jury she attributes all of her symptoms to the mercury, but admitted that to this day she has 'no knowledge whatsoever' regarding the consequences of ingesting the substance. Despite the pains and sickness, Ms Knowles said it was the hurt she felt which affected her most in the wake of the alleged incident. 'I was distraught for the whole day and beyond,' she said. Ms Knowles told the court the surgery was 'less than harmonious', and spoke about a dentist in the surgery requesting not to work with Kaur and in turn Kaur refusing to work with another dentist. On Kaur’s refusal to work with one of the dentists, Ms Knowles said: 'They had a clash of personality. Both had come to me with separate issues.' Laura Knowles claims she was hospitalised after drinking the 'mercury laced tea' Ms . Knowles told the jury about how Kaur’s relationship with a fellow . dental nurse had 'deteriorated so badly it was affecting patients coming . into the surgery'. She . said there was a culture of complaining about fellow staff members, . describing the extent as 'certainly week on week', and acknowledged that . 'general sniping' was commonplace. Ms Knowles herself was spoken to by Dr Shams Moopen - the practice owner - about a letter he had received from a dental nurse complaining about Knowles’ 'preferential treatment' of Kaur, the woman accused of putting mercury in her coffee. Kaur denies poisoning the drink, saying she was framed by colleagues . Ms Knowles said he spoke to her about the 'disharmony within the practice' and said staff would have to 'behave more appropriately'. Despite the discontent in the surgery, she believed she was on good terms with Kaur, telling the jury: 'I considered myself to be Ravi’s friend and mentor.' Mr Bowers told the jury that a letter sent to Kaur by Dr Moopen following a disciplinary meeting on March 13 - described as a final warning - was withdrawn by him on March 29 and he also apologised. The letter said Kaur had 'serious disagreements' with colleagues which 'disrupted the smooth running of the surgery'. It suggested that she had left patients in the dentist’s chair because she believed it was time for her to have her lunch. The letter warned her that any future misconduct could result in her dismissal. Kaur denies poisoning the drink, saying she was framed by colleagues.The nurse of Bedford, enies administering a noxious substance with intent to annoy, injure or aggrieve. The trial continues.

Some of the world's earliest colour movies have finally been shown to the public 120 years after they were shot having been painstakingly restored by film archivists. The obscure film segments, which give a never seen before glimpse of the Edwardian age,  were long considered to be failed prototypes and had been consigned to an archive. But after recording the footage digitally, workers at the National Media Museum in Bradford were able to unlock remarkably modern-looking images created more than a century ago. Scroll down to see some of the colour footage . The way we were: One of the earliest known colour films in existence shows horse-drawn carriages near Hyde Park Corner, in London in 1902. The footage was painstakingly restored by archivists at National Media Museum in the Bradford . The scenes, screened at the Science Museum, ranged from roughly 5 to 40 seconds and showed a parrot, a London street scene, and three smiling children sitting around a table covered with a burgundy cloth batting at a goldfish bowl with large sunflowers. 'No one really has seen it until more or less today,' said Michael Harvey, the Media Museum's curator of cinematography. 'Look at the age of it. Here you've actually got color film from the early Edwardian period.' He said he hoped the movies would change people's perceptions of 'what was possible back then.' Playtime: Three Edwardian children gather round a table entranced by two goldfish in this astounding colour shot from the turn of the century . A scarlet Macaw on a perch. After transferring the footage to digital workers at the National Media Museum in Bradford were able to unlock remarkably modern-looking images created more than a century ago . The film is slightly jerky but of decent quality. With the exception of the kids' frilly turn-of-the-century clothes and some mild discoloration, the sun-drenched clip of children playing might have been something shot by a baby boomer in his or her back yard with a 1970s Minolta camera. Experts have dated the movie segments back to 1901 or 1902, when cinema was still in its infancy and inventors on both sides of the Atlantic were racing to produce ever-more realistic films. American inventor Thomas Edison led the way with peep-show-like Kinetoscope; the Lumiere brothers had wowed French audiences with moving images projected onto screens in 1895. The next challenge was to shoot a film in color. That was no mean feat. Working in London, inventor-photographer Edward Turner devised a complex, three-color process which would shoot black-and-white negatives through red, green and blue filters alternating in rapid succession. Showtime: Negative scans from two reels of the early film. Archivists were able to restore the footage after transferring it to digital storage . The idea was to project three differently filtered frames at a time on to a screen to create the illusion of a single, colorful movie.In theory, anyway. In practice the timing of the filters and distance from the screen had to be perfectly calibrated or the movie became 'a horrible mess,' according to Bryony Dixon, the curator of silent film at the British Film Institute's National Archive. Turner never quite got the hang of the process, and when he died of a heart attack in 1903 his footage was passed on to American film entrepreneur, Charles Urban, who partnered with film pioneer George Albert Smith to develop a modified (and much more successful) system, dubbed Kinemacolor, in 1906. Harvey said that Urban donated . Turner's footage to the London Science Museum in 1937, where it stayed . until about four years ago, when it was sent to the National Media . Museum. Experts digitized the footage, finally allowing it to be shown.

Dixon noted that earlier films had been colored artificially - sometimes by painting right onto the black-and-white film - but said that the movies displayed Wednesday were 'the first natural working color film in the world.' Film historian Mark Cousins said in an email that he was excited not by the technology or what he described as the 'firstism issue,' but by what he said might be called 'the drive to beauty in the early inventors of cinema.' 'They saw from the start that cinema could make you gasp at the beauty of a fish or a sunflower,' he said.","Obscure film segments are believed to date from around 1901 or 1902 .

Lord Justice Leveson is facing fresh questions over his refusal to investigate an affair between a member of his legal team and a lawyer representing phone hacking victims. A Conservative MP has written to the judge, who was in charge of last year’s public inquiry into Press standards, querying his insistence that Carine Patry Hoskins had no input into its key conclusions. Rob Wilson, a parliamentary aide to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is calling for a full investigation by the Bar Standards Board into revelations that Miss Patry Hoskins and celebrities’ barrister David Sherborne are lovers. No probe: Lord Justice Leveson is refusing to investigate the affair between Carine Patry Hoskins, a member of his legal team, and David Sherborne, a lawyer representing phone hacking victims . The Standards Board’s code of conduct suggests affairs between opposing lawyers should be avoided in case the perception be created of ‘a danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. Twice-married Mr Sherborne, 44, represented Hugh Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking. The father-of-three and Miss Patry Hoskins, 40, a married mother-of-two, admit going on holiday to the romantic Greek island of Santorini in August last year, days after the inquiry’s public hearings ended in July. But they claim their affair did not begin until after the Leveson report was published in November. The couple did not tell Lord Justice Leveson or his senior counsel, Robert Jay QC, about the relationship. The judge only learnt of their trip to the Greek island – during which the couple say they discussed ‘the possibility of a future relationship’ – when the Daily Mail asked him to comment on it after revealing the affair. No effect: Leveson has dismissed the idea that his report on media standards could have been tainted by the alleged relationship between Carine Patry Hoskins and David Sherborne . Lord Justice Leveson has dismissed . criticism that the revelations have undermined his inquiry, saying there . was ‘simply no room’ for a ‘breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. He insisted Miss Patry Hoskins had ‘absolutely no input into any conclusion’ and was ‘simply not involved in any aspect’ of his proposals for Press regulation. In his letter to the judge, Mr Wilson . queried why he had cited August 3 of last year, shortly before draft . criticisms were sent to key players for comment, as the crucial ‘cut . off’ date in the case. As controversy continues over a new system of Press regulation in the wake of the Leveson report, a senior figure said yesterday that the newspaper industry’s proposals for a Royal Charter on the issue deserve ‘equal consideration’ alongside plans drawn up by the Government. Lord Wakeham, a former Conservative Cabinet minister and ex-chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, said the proposals could meet Lord Justice Leveson’s call  for independent voluntary self-regulation. Last week the newspaper industry rejected the Government’s plans for Press regulation. It submitted a rival proposal for a Royal Charter to enshrine a new watchdog with the power to levy £1million fines on errant publishers and require prominent corrections of errors. He wrote: ‘In your letter you suggest . that Ms Patry Hoskins had “no input into any conclusion as to the past . treatment of those affected by Press abuses (or, indeed, the . relationship between the Press and the public as considered by module . one of the inquiry) or any aspect of the proposals made for future Press . regulation” between August 3 and publication of your report in November . 2012. ‘Is it possible that she may have had an input into the inquiry’s conclusions before August 3, 2012? ‘If the answer … is yes, I would be grateful if you would confirm what work did Ms Patry Hoskins in fact did prior to August 3 (aside from questioning witnesses).’ Mr Wilson, MP for Reading East, also asked how much of the cost of the four counsel to the inquiry–  £1,353,900 between them as of October 2012 – went to Miss Patry Hoskins. MPs have demanded that Lord Justice Leveson launch a full investigation, and a series of questions about who knew what and when remain to be answered. Miss Patry Hoskins, dubbed the ‘thinking man’s Pippa Middleton’, was required to be totally independent when testing evidence given to the inquiry on behalf of the public. She questioned witnesses, including Mr Sherborne’s clients, with grievances against the Press. At one point she trended on Twitter as #womanontheleft after being spotted by viewers who suggested she was making eyes at Mr Grant. She is understood to be divorcing her 45-year-old husband, QC Mark Hoskins.","Lord Justice Leveson is refusing to investigate alleged affair .

Britons travelling to former French colonies in Africa are at risk of being targeted for hostage-taking by Al Qaeda fighters. The brother of a former deputy leader of Al Qaeda warned that revenge will be sought for those countries which assisted the French in their crackdown of terrorism in the region. Mohammed al-Zawahiri, the brother of Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, told French weekly Le Point: 'France is playing with fire... By . attacking Mali, France lit the fuse and will suffer the consequences. Revenge: Britons travelling to former French colonies in Africa are at risk of being targeted for hostage-taking by Al Qaeda fighters, they have today been warned. Armoured French vehicles are pictured in northern Mali . 'The reaction of jihadi fighters is likely to be strong, be it in Mali or on French territory. 'We have neither bombs nor planes, but our resources allow us to take hostages to defend ourselves,' said the Egyptian Islamist. In January, 330 UK troops were sent to the region to help the French army, push back Islamic extremists who had taken hold of the north, which has now begun a phased withdrawal of its 4,500-strong force. The Guardian, at the time, reported a 'number of British special forces' troops on the ground in Mali when the country began its stand-off with Al Qaeda terror groups. But now, Al Qaeda are seeking payback and have western tourists in the region in their sights. Although the threat has been reported in the French press as primarily against French citizens, it is feared that Al Qaeda in the Magreb (AQIM) terror cells will take all westerners in the region as hostages and will also consider British travellers as fair game, due to Britain’s role in the recent French-led operation there. Worrying: French troops are pictured with Malian soldiers in the historic city of Timbuktu, Mali. Al Qaeda are seeking payback for the action of western forces in the region and have western tourists in sights . AQIM recently made a press statement warning that all countries which helped France would be considered an enemy. 'No one who participated in this . ferocious attack on our people in north Mali will be safe,' it said in a . recent statement for the press. Al Qaeda terror cells there are planning on revenge for what they see as attacks which 'killed' their children and are organising themselves to step up kidnapping of holiday makers in the region of west Africa - where Al Qaeda in the Magreb (AQIM) has control, in part, of Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Libya, Burkina Faso and Chad. France’s military intervention in Mali saw French-led troops recapture key towns in northern Mali that had been occupied for months by Islamist groups linked to Al-Qaeda. AQIM operates a terrorist network of fighters 4,300-mile-long strip across the Sahel region, including not only Mali but also portions of Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Libya, Burkina Faso and Chad. The al-Qaida affiliate, which became part of the terror network in 2006, is one of three Islamist groups in northern Mali. AQIM is still believed to be holding five French hostages after announcing earlier this year it had killed one of them. Lat week, the group said the fate of the remaining captives 'is in the hands of French President Francois Hollande and the door is still open to find a just solution.' Ayman al-Zawahiri, who succeeded Osama bin Laden as Al-Qaeda chief in 2011, had already warned France at the beginning of April that it would meet in Mali 'the same fate as America in Iraq and Afghanistan.' It is his brother though, Mohammed, who was jailed in 1999 for acts of terrorism in Egypt – who walked free when Hosni Mubarak fell in 2011, who made the warnings in Paris.","Al Qaeda warned of revenge on countries which assisted the French .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 07:58 EST, 13 January 2012 . Two years after a devastating earthquake, Haiti is struggling to rebuild its ravaged buildings and hundreds of thousands of victims remain homeless. The 7.0 magnitude quake on January 12, 2010, lasted only a few seconds but killed around 300,000 people and left more than 1.5million without homes. Since then, however, reconstruction has been painfully slow, with squalid tent camps housing more than a half a million people in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. Rubble: The National Palace in Port au Prince, Haiti, remains in ruins, two years after the 7.0 magnitude earthquake, and below, the palace in the immediate aftermath of the quake in January 2010 . As it was: The stunning structure before the disaster . As the country holds solemn . ceremonies at massive grave sites to remember the dead from Haiti's . worst-ever natural disaster, President Michel Martelly has vowed to . redouble government efforts to help people rebuild their lives. 'This . year is a year when we will really start rebuilding physically but also . rebuilding the hope and the future of the Haitian people,' he said. He . also announced new efforts backed by the Canadian government to . relocate some 20,000 people from tent encampments only blocks from the . still crumpled presidential palace. Canada said it was contributing $20million to the relocation effort in one of the world's poorest countries. In . the first event of Thursday's remembrance, Martelly plans to inaugurate . a new university donated by Haiti's neighbour, the Dominican . Republic. Located . near the two countries' shared border, the Roi Henri Christophe . University will be one of Haiti's biggest buildings and Martelly hopes . the event will send a signal the country is taking steps forward.  He is attending Thursday's opening with former U.S. President Bill Clinton, a UN Special Envoy to Haiti. Tent city: Only yards from the grandeur of the palace, the refugee camp at the Square Champs Mars, taken on 11 January 2012, top; and on 16 January 2010, below . Then and now: Desallines, a neighbourhood in Port au Prince, shown on 11 January 2012, top, and on 16 January 2010, below . Clean up: While this street has been partially cleared of debris, only half of the roads on Port au Prince have been cleared of concrete, steel and other debris . Services throughout the deeply religious country saw women in white dresses and men in dark suits walking to church through streets which were unusually quiet on what is a national holiday of remembrance. Memorial services were planned at a UN base and the site north of the capital where thousands of quake victims are buried. Despite billions of dollars of international donations and aid pledges, many Haitians say they see few tangible results of the recovery and reconstruction effort. Just over half of the piles of concrete, steel and other debris littering the capital of Port-au-Prince and its surrounding areas has been cleared. This is in stark contrast to the regions of Japan struck by last year's devastating tsunami. Just six months after the huge wave struck, many areas had been totally cleared of all debris and were ready for rebuilding of homes and shops. Bedlam: A huge crowd flock onto the Desallines Avenue in Port au Prince on January 16 2010 in the bottom image. The street is much quieter in the top picture, but the damaged buildings still remain . Open to the heavens: The damaged Cathedral in Port-au-Prince shows the devastation caused by the earthquake two years previously . Cinema: While some of the rubble has been cleared from the Triomphe in Port au Prince - seen here on 11 January 2012, top, and 13 January 2010, below - construction appears to be still ongoing . Haitians, meanwhile, also complain about a lack of housing and jobs two years after the quake. Overseas disability charity CBM  says that for hundreds of thousands of Haitians the earthquake still dictates their lives: living in temporary shelters, they are 'unemployed and, above all, are marked by the . physical and psychological consequences of the disaster'. Government officials point to post-quake projects such as a $257million industrial park being built on Haiti's northwest coast and a program to stimulate agriculture production as evidence some progress is being made. Contrast: The town of Onagawa, in the Japanese region of Miyagi, was devastated by the tsunami which struck in March 2011 (top picture).  Yet six months later the entire area had been cleared of rubble and was ready for rebuilding .","Despite billions of dollars in donations and aid, many Haitians say they see few tangible results of the recovery and reconstruction effort ."

Two friends died while cooking a pie in a killer oven which is still being used in 7,000 British kitchens, an inquest heard. Housemates Richard Smith, 30, and Kevin Branton, 34, were killed by lethal carbon monoxide within minutes of turning on the grill made by manufacturer Beko,  who have previously been criticised for selling fridges freezers which catch fire. Mr Smith's father Brian said the tragedy had left a 'huge gaps in our hearts' and he hoped the pair would be the last victims of faulty equipment. Kevin Branton, pictured left, and Richard Smith, right, were killed almost instantly by lethal gases as they cooked a pie in their Beko oven at their home in Cornwall . Beko recalled the product as the cooker has a complete seal around the oven which means if the grill is used with the door shut it can be deadly. The  Flavel Milano 50 grill begins to produce lethal carbon monoxide because the seal doesn't allow any oxygen to get inside. The pair were cooking a pie when the oven began releasing the odourless fumes which filled the house in minutes and killed them both. At least six other people in the UK  have fallen victim to several faulty models of Beko ovens, the inquest in Truro, Cornwall, heard. The Beko oven, pictured, which killed Mr Smith and Mr Branton has been recalled by the company but it is believed that 7,000 are still in use in the UK . Beko recalled the ovens, 21,000 of which were sold, but only managed to contact 80 per cent of customers, it was said. Trading standards officers and Beko admit there are still around 7,000 being used in the UK. Mr Smith, an administrative officer for the Child Support Agency, and Mr Branton, a ground worker, were found dead in their home in Saltash, Cornwall, in December 2010. The inquest heard the cooker was purchased by Mr Branton's parents from Derry's Cooperative in Plymouth, Devon, in 2008. Floral tributes were left for the friends outside their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after they were killed by the lethal gases in 2010 . Mr Smith's father, Brian, told the inquest: 'Richard and Kevin had the rest of their lives ahead of them. 'But their lives were tragically ended by something as simple as a grill door on a cooker. 'Kevin and Richard have left huge gaps in our hearts and for everyone who knew them we will miss them for everyday of our lives. 'Testing of household appliances is not adequate. More time and money must be spent on making sure they are safe. 'Richard and Kevin are not the first to lose their lives in this way but hopefully they will be the last.' In the two months before their Beko oven was installed five others had died using its grill in the same way. Health and Safety Executive engineer Steve Critchlow, who investigated the accident, told the inquest the grill became dangerous if used with the door closed. The oven, pictured, started leaking carbon monoxide - a colourless, odourless gas - as the two men tried to cook a pie . He said cooker grills should not be operated with the door shut as this limits oxygen and can cause carbon monoxide to be produced. Some ovens have a safety cut-out to stop that happening and others have an air gap around the door, he explained. But the Flavel Milano 50 grill had a door fitted with a complete seal which was a manufacturer's defect. Mr Critchlow said it was possible there 'could still be people out there with cookers in a dangerous condition'. The tragedy takes to eight the number of UK deaths linked to defective Beko, Leisure and Flavel cookers all made in the companies Turkish factory. Trading Standards officer Gary Webster told the inquest that British oven testing standards have been modified to include tests on grills with the door closed. He said the Beko appliance could be made safe by a simple modification which involves removing part of the seal. Beko have also recently been criticised after a faulty brand of its fridge freezer was linked to a series of house fires leaving 15 people injured and one person dead. A spokesman for Beko said: 'This is a great tragedy and our deepest condolences go to the family and friends of Mr. Branton and Mr Smith. 'In November 2008, Beko became aware of a safety risk pertaining to certain models of the Beko, Leisure and Flavel gas cookers. This risk can be eliminated by a simple modification, carried out by our service engineers free of charge. 'Since we became aware of the issue in November 2008, we immediately launched a corrective action program.' That included sending letters to all customers on its database, door-knocking campaigns and advertising in the national and local press. They claim that the oven met all testing standards when it was first released. He added: 'Beko have successfully lobbied to change the testing standards at the EU level to make the testing regime more rigorous. 'As a result of this extensive activity, a majority of affected models have been located and modified. However, 6998 affected units remain untraced in the UK.' A verdict of accidental death for both men was recorded by a jury at Truro County Hall. Mr Branton's mother Denise Wray said: 'Kevin was a person who loved life. He loved working and loved to spend his money socialising with his friends. He will be missed every day.' Carbon monoxide gas is colourless, odourless, tasteless, very poisonous and can kill in minutes.","Richard Smith, 30, and Kevin Branton, 34, were killed almost instatly as lethal carbon monoxide filled their home in Saltash, Cornwall .

Serial sex attacker: Antoni Imiela was jailed for 12 years for raping Sheila Jankowitz in the early hours of Christmas Day 1987 . One of Britain’s most notorious sex attackers was convicted yesterday of raping a woman on Christmas Day a quarter of a century ago. Antoni Imiela, 57, attacked his victim in a London street as she searched for her husband after a row.The violent rapist and armed robber was told he is unlikely to be released from prison until he is too frail to pose a threat to women. He is already serving seven life  sentences for a string of horrific sex attacks that led to him being dubbed the M25 rapist. Advances in forensic technology enabled cold-case detectives to identify a minute trace of DNA that Imiela left at the scene of the 1987 attack. Police were shocked that the sex predator could theoretically have applied for parole earlier this month, just eight years after he was jailed. The case revealed that his appalling history of sexual violence began 14 years earlier than they originally suspected. Detectives believe he could be responsible for dozens more offences and appealed for other victims to break their silence. Judge John Bevan QC said the minimum sentence for Imiela’s other crimes would never have been set so low if the 1987 rape had been known. Rapist: Antoni Imiela appears in court accused of attacking Sheila Jankowitz. As he was jailed today, the judge says he is 'wholly unrepentant' Jailing him for 12 years at the Old . Bailey, he said the rapist had never expressed remorse and treated his . victim with ‘contempt and violence’. The judge said: ‘I disagree with the suggestion you hate women. You seem to me to have a dislike of humanity in general. ‘Despite . you serving eight years of your life sentence you have not expressed . one jot of remorse or repentance. You remain as dangerous as you clearly . were in 2004. ‘In my . judgment you will, unless you show a change of attitude that would . require courage you do not possess, remain a danger to the public until . you are infirm.’ 'M25 rapist': Antoni Imiela (centre) is arrested over a series of rapes he carried out in the 1990s - ten years after he attacked Sheila Jankowitz . 'Dislike of humanity': Serial rapist Antoni Imiela who was locked up for a further 12 years . Imiela, of . Ashford, Kent, was convicted of raping 29-year-old mother-of-two Sheila . Jankowitz as she left her flat in Sydenham, South East London, in the . early hours of Christmas Day in 1987. The . case was unusual because Mrs Jankowitz was murdered in South Africa in . 2006 and her only evidence came from a written statement. Instead . her husband and daughter, who remain deeply traumatised by the attack, . were forced to relive the ordeal in the witness box. Mrs . Jankowitz was dragged on to waste ground behind the block of flats . where she lived with her family, punched, threatened with a brick and . subjected to an appalling attack. Forensic . tests revealed the likelihood of a sample of bodily fluids found on the . victim coming from someone other than Imiela was ‘one in a billion’. Imiela . was labelled the M25 rapist after snatching women and girls off the . street in several Home Counties before using the motorway as a  getaway . route. Sex attacker: Imiela tried to rebuild his life after being released from prison in the 1990s . Antoni Imiela’s merciless attack on Sheila Jankowitz was the precursor to a series of violent stranger rapes that he committed more than a decade later. The Old Bailey heard that he knew he was facing a lengthy jail sentence for armed robbery when he pounced on Mrs Jankowitz in the early hours of Christmas Day 1987. Two weeks later he handed himself in to police for the robbery spree and was eventually jailed for 14 years. He was released in 1996, and five years later began a terrifying campaign of rapes across the south of England on victims as young as 10. Imiela was dubbed 'the M25 rapist'. He would snatch his victims where they were walking, drag them into a secluded area and rape them - exactly what he had done to Mrs Jankowitz more than a decade before. Born in Lubeck, West Germany, in 1954 to a Polish father, a soldier, and German mother, Imiela spent part of his early childhood in a displaced people’s camp as his parents were both refugees. The family moved to the UK in 1961 and spent time in Worthing, West Sussex, before eventually settling in the north east. But his life spiralled out of control and he was first sent to Borstal at the age of 15 when he was locked up for robbery. He had a child but his relationship with his partner came to a turbulent end in the mid 1980s. In February 1987, after Imiela lost his job as a plasterer, he began his series of armed robberies across the country before he raped Sheila Jankowitz. After his release from prison in 1996, he tried to build a new life in the south of England with another woman. Christine, who was just recovering from a turbulent relationship with another man, married Imiela in 1997 and the couple moved into an old council house in the village of Appledore in Kent. Imiela tried a string of odd jobs, including running a 'bric-a-brac' stall in nearby Rye, East Sussex, before finding work on the railways. Colleagues recalled that he would brag to them about his use of prostitutes - although it later emerged that some of the stories might actually have been about rape victims. One colleague said that shortly before Imiela’s arrest for the seven rapes, he saw him at St Pancras railway station in London, where he boasted that he 'went with this young girl and she looked only about 12'. A few days earlier, Imiela had driven to Birmingham and kidnapped a 10-year-old girl at knifepoint before putting her through a five-hour sex ordeal in his car. He also suggested to another colleague - who had no idea his fellow railway worker was the rapist - that the little girl might have 'deserved it'.","Antoni Imiela raped Sheila Jankowitz in 1987 .

The weeklong search for a Las Vegas girl ended Friday afternoon when officials confirmed that a small body found in an undeveloped housing tract belonged to the missing child. The Clark County coroner's office said a body discovered Thursday belongs to 10-year-old Jade Morris, who police had been searching for since Christmas Day. She died of multiple stab wounds, the coroner's office said. Blood was found inside a car borrowed by a Las Vegas card dealer last seen with a missing 10-year-old girl and later arrested in the razor blade slashing of a co-worker, a prosecutor said Friday. Brenda Stokes Wilson was identified in court Friday as the prime suspect in the slaying, although prosecutor Robert Daskas told a judge that authorities haven't positively identified the girl found dead Thursday in an undeveloped housing tract in North Las Vegas. ‘It's no secret the defendant is the suspect in the murder of 10-year-old Jade Morris,’ Daskas said as he convinced Senior Clark County District Court Judge Joseph Bonaventure to increase Wilson's bail from $60,000 to $600,000 pending the filing of kidnapping and murder charges.

Wilson, . 50, was arrested later that night after she was wrestled to the ground . with razors in each hand following a face-slashing attack on a female . co-worker, Joyce Rhone, at the Bellagio resort. Wilson . has been jailed on felony battery with a weapon, burglary and mayhem . charges that could get her decades in prison. Police said she has . offered no help in the search for the missing girl. Murder and kidnapping charges could get her life in prison without parole or the death penalty.Wilson . stood in court flanked by eight police officers as her lawyer, Tony . Liker, clutching a Bible and a copy of the charging documents, asked the . judge to postpone arraignment until Wednesday to give him time to meet . with Wilson. Police went . public with the search for Jade Morris on Christmas Day, and the case . received increasing attention after the relationship between the girl . and Wilson became known. Clark . County District Attorney Steve Wolfson watched the proceedings in court . Friday and called the case important for the community. Justice: A judge agreed to increase Wilson's bail from $60,000 to $600,000 pending the filing of kidnapping and murder charges . Wilson, who had been identified by police and prosecutors as Brenda Stokes, told the judge Friday that her full name was Brenda Stokes Wilson. She used to date the missing girl's father, Philip Morris, and had a long and trusted relationship with Jade Morris, according to the missing girl's grandfather, Philip Tucker. Philip Morris was removed from court Wednesday by armed court officers after shouting questions about his daughter's whereabouts to Wilson. He did not attend Friday's hearing. Tucker said Philip Morris lived in Billings, Montana, and worked at a Flying J truck stop for more than a year. He would stay with Wilson when he visited Las Vegas, Tucker said. Tucker said Rhone was Wilson's best friend and also knew Philip Morris. Heartbroken: Claudette Flanagan-Jones, left, Jade Morris' grandmother, Tejuana Reeves-Morris, Jade's mother, and Andres Mack, Jade's grandfather, sit while Brenda Stokes Wilson appears at court . Authorities have not disclosed a motive for the slaying. But Tucker said Wilson appeared to believe that Rhone and Philip Morris had become romantically involved. Tucker said he didn't know if Wilson's jealousy was well-founded. 'But whatever was going on with them didn't concern Jade,' Tucker said. 'How do you take a kid who loves you so much and hurt her?' Jade Morris has been missing for a week after family friend Brenda Stokes offered to take her Christmas shopping. The pair never returned. That night Stokes allegedly slashed a co-worker in the face with razor blade at the famed Bellagio resort on the Las Vegas strip. Emotional scene: Brenda Morris, center, 10-year-old Jade Morris' grandmother, cries and hugs Jade's other grandmother, Claudette Flanagan-Jones, left, outside the courtroom . Jade's family last saw her at about 5pm on December 21, when Stokes picked her up for a shopping outing, police said. Police said Stokes was a trusted friend of the girl's father, and family members have told reporters that the two dated for several years. Stokes was arrested later that night after she was accused of slashing her co-worker. Stokes, 50, is now in jail, and Capt. Jones said she has not cooperated in the investigation of the girl's whereabouts. She even denied collecting the girl from her home. A passer-by called 911 about noon Thursday, and North Las Vegas police found a girl's body in brush near palm trees in a small traffic circle near Dorrell Lane and North Fifth Street. Blackjack dealer Brenda Stokes, 50, was arrested for allegedly slashing a colleagues the same night Jade went missing . The location is a short distance from the northern 215 Beltway and about 10 miles from the downtown Las Vegas outlet mall off Interstate 15 where Stokes was to have taken the girl shopping. Attempts to reach family members have been unsuccessful. Stokes had picked up the girl to take her shopping and two hours later returned to another friend the red 2007 Saab sedan that she borrowed for the trip, Capt Jones said. Daskas said police have the vehicle and are testing blood found on the driver's door and steering wheel to see if it matches Jade Morris. Stokes later got a ride with a friend to the Bellagio, police said. Later, Stokes got a lift with a friend to the luxury hotel famed for its elaborate fountain displays, where she was arrested after authorities say she attacked a female co-worker, Joyce Rhone, with a razor in each hand as Rhone dealt blackjack about 9:30 p.m. Rhone, 44, was hospitalized with deep cuts on her face, including one from her ear to the edge of her mouth. A police arrest report said Rhone also had several smaller cuts around her right eye. The arrest report says casino video shows Stokes attacking Rhone before a casino patron and security officers intervene. Officer Marcus Martin said the video is evidence that may be shown by prosecutors in court but will not be made public by police. Police said Stokes later told investigators that she attacked Rhone over harassing phone calls and an unspecified betrayal that ended their seven-year friendship. The slashing attack is said to have happened at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas strip. The luxury hotel is famed for its elaborate fountain displays, pictured . Stokes also told police she visited her doctor last week, seeking to be admitted to a hospital 'due to feeling like she wanted to hurt someone'. When the family heard that Stokes had been arrested in a vicious knife attack on a fellow card dealer on the casino floor of the Bellagio, they grew concerned for their daughter's well-being. The girl's father, Philip Morris, who is reportedly engaged to Stokes, had said just days ago he was sure Jade was still alive. It is unknown how many of the Bellagio's 4,000 guests saw the fight, which occurred in the crowded casino at around 9.45pm, but it came just a week after many witnessed a murder-suicide in a busy hotel lobby on the Las Vegas strip.","Coroner confirms DNA evidence found in suspects car .

In matters of the heart, it appears Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's ruthless streak got the better of his chivalrous side . He is viewed as Hitler’s finest general, respected even by the Allies as a professional and honourable soldier. But Erwin Rommel was also capable of great cunning, as his opponents learned when they were outmanoeuvred on the battlefields of North Africa. In matters of the heart, it appears that this ruthless streak got the better of his chivalrous side. In fact, his grandson says the man nicknamed the Desert Fox was a love rat. Josef Pan, 72, is to publish the story of his grandmother Walburga’s love affair with Rommel – an affair which he says Rommel covered up for the sake of his career. Mr Pan, from Bavaria, owns the 150 letters Rommel sent to Walburga, who committed suicide 15 years after she bore his child. He also has a photo of the couple shortly before the First World War. ‘Walburga gave birth to my mother Gertrud Stemmer, on December 8, 1913, but he turned away from her and married Lucie Mollin in 1916,’ said Mr Pan. ‘My grandmother died in 1928, a few months before Rommel had his son, Manfred, with Lucie.’ Rommel had delighted in the birth of Gertrud and wrote to her calling her his ‘little mouse’. He once said he would like to set up home with Walburga and Gertrud. ‘It’s got to be perfect, this little nest of ours,’ he said. However, he returned to Lucie, with whom he had had an  affair, and married her in 1916. Walburga never recovered from  her rejection. Mr Pan said: ‘Rommel was Walburga’s only love. As long as Rommel and Lucie never had children, she held on to the conviction that he would return to her.’ Josef Pan, 72, is to publish the story of his grandmother Walburga's love affair with Rommel. He said the Desert Fox spurned her and married Lucie Mollin in 1916. Above, Lucie with Rommel and their son Manfred . When Walburga knew Lucie was pregnant, she took an overdose, said Mr Pan. Above, Rommel (seen here in the African desert) in France in 1944 . But when she knew Lucie was pregnant she took an overdose, said Mr Pan, adding: ‘The explanation given was that she had died of pneumonia. 'Later the family doctor told my mother she had taken her own life.’ 'Rommel was Walburga's only love. As long as Rommel and Lucie (above) never had children, she held on to the conviction that he would return to her,' said Mr Pan . Gertrud exchanged hundreds of letters with her father and his wife knew about her. She even knitted him a scarf, which he wore frequently at the battlefront. Rommel, a decorated officer in the First World War, distinguished himself during the invasion of France in 1940 and later in North Africa where he earned his reputation as a skilful but honourable general prior to his defeat at El Alamein by Britain’s Eighth Army – the Desert Rats. Despite failure in Africa, Rommel was . still immensely popular in Germany. In 1943, Hitler gave him command . over the sea defences of occupied France. In June 4, 1944, he left for Germany to celebrate Lucie’s 50th birthday. On the same day, the Allied invasion of France began. Once again, Rommel had to rush back to the battlefield. Wounded in an air attack on his car, he returned home to convalesce. Gertrud . stayed close to the family, even after her father was forced to commit . suicide in 1944 after he was implicated in the plot by senior army . officers to kill Hitler. He took his own life after being assured by the Nazis that if he did so his family would be unharmed.","Josef Pan's grandmother Walburga had love affair with Rommel .

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 19:01 EST, 12 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:26 EST, 12 March 2013 . Town and country: Sir Simon Jenkins, chairman of the National Trust, says the children of families in rural areas don't have a God-given right to live near their parents . Children raised in the countryside have no automatic right to live near their parents’ homes when they grow up, the chairman of the National Trust declared yesterday. Sir Simon Jenkins said the majority of new homes should be built in towns and cities, rather than in unspoilt rural areas. His comments are at odds with existing policies that encourage affordable housing to be built in villages for local families. Sir Simon said: ‘Somehow it is considered the right of people in the country to have their children living next door at public expense. I don’t understand it. ‘Are you going to say that people who have lived in the Windrush Valley [in the Cotswolds] for 100 years have a right to go on living there? No, I’m afraid they don’t. Sorry.’ Last night, some countryside groups attacked his comments, warning that villages without young families risked being turned into ‘little more than retirement ghettoes’. But Sir Simon, who owns homes in west London and rural Wales, even called for areas of the countryside to be listed to protect the most beautiful parts. He suggested introducing four different listed ‘grades’ of countryside – one of which could include a ‘presumption against development’. He said: ‘We should list the countryside as we list the town by virtue of its beauty.What it is that people want to retain. ‘We don’t want to pull down Belgravia. We don’t want to build housing estates in Hyde Park. We should adopt the same approach to the countryside.’ Picturesque: Sheepscome in the Cotswolds. Families who have lived in villages like this do not have a right to go on living there, says Sir Simon. He says the majority of new homes should be built in towns and cities . Idyll: The village of Snowshill in the Cotswolds. Many countryside groups say there is an urgent need for affordable homes in rural areas . But opponents warned that house prices will rise even higher in rural areas if new homes are not built there. The row comes at a time when the average home in the countryside costs around £200,000 – around £30,000 more than a town house. Under threat? Castle Combe in Wiltshire. A minister said Britain faces a situation where home ownership is the right of a privileged few unless more homes are built . The . Windrush is a river in the Cotswolds, which flows through the famously . picturesque village of Bourton-on-the-Water as well as the Prime . Minister’s constituency town of Witney. Prices of homes near the Windrush can be eye-watering, with bungalows in Bourton-on-the-Water selling for up to £645,000 in recent months. But Sir Simon, who was speaking in a . personal capacity, told the Home Builders’ Federation conference in . central London: ‘I want building to take place in towns on the whole. I . want there to be massive incentives to build in towns because it makes . more sense.’ He said there . will be many parts of the countryside – ‘on the whole, rather lovely . parts of the countryside’ – that ‘just don’t want to take large numbers . of more people.’ He singled . out the Cotswolds village of Stow-on-the-Wold, where he said many . residents are ‘seriously angry’ at proposals to build a large number of . new homes. Last night his comments were attacked by those who said more affordable rural homes were needed. Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders’ Federation, said: ‘We need to be providing homes across the country in places where people want to live. We should not be trying to just pigeon-hole people into living in towns where they might not want to live.’ Kate Houghton, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘We do agree that the bulk of new housing should be built in or near to urban areas, so people have more easy access to public transport, community facilities and essential services. Sir Simon said protecting villages like Bisley from major housing developments and concentrating new homes in towns and cities 'makes sense' ‘However, if we don’t make provision . for at least some affordable houses in rural areas, where it is clear . that there is need and people do want to stay, then our villages could . become little more than retirement ghettoes or commuter dormitories.’ At the conference, Malcolm Harris, chairman of house builders Bovis, accused Sir Simon of being ‘quite naïve’. He . said: ‘These are your children. These are people who already live in . the community. We have failed for year after year after year to provide . the housing. That is a real issue in Great Britain.’ In England, around 110,000 new homes are . built ever year, but this is way behind the rate at which new . households are being formed, estimated to be around 230,000 a year. A spokesman for Priced Out, the first-time buyers’ campaign group, accused Sir Simon of being ‘out of touch with the aspirations of hard-working young adults who have been priced out of a home in their local area.’ Housing Minister Mark Prisk, who spoke at the same conference, said home ownership remains the dream of the vast majority of Britons. He told builders that the quality of the homes they build is just as important as the quantity, calling on them to reject the stereotype of the ‘rabbit hutch’. Sir Simon’s intervention comes weeks after Planning Minister Nick Boles warned Britain will be dragged back to the 19th century when home-ownership was the preserve of the wealthiest unless more homes are built. He said: ‘We can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends. We can shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th century: a privilege, the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents. ‘Or we can accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land and resolve that we will make these decisions locally.’","Sir Simon Jenkins rails against more homes being built in the countryside .

Campaign: Paul Lamb has launched a legal battle for the right to ask a doctor to end his life . A paralysed man is fighting for the right to die with the help of a doctor, taking up the case begun by Tony Nicklinson. Paul Lamb, 58, only has slight movement in his right hand after a car accident in 1990. Next month, he will tell the Appeal Court that a doctor who acted to kill him would be carrying out a necessary procedure to end his suffering. Mr Nicklinson died last year at the age of 58 just days after he lost his legal bid to end his life with a doctor's help, but his family won permission to continue his campaign. Mr Lamb said his life is so pointless that he often goes to bed at 5pm. But he is not physically able to kill himself and any doctor who helped him would be guilty of murder. Mr . Lamb, from Leeds, told the BBC: 'I just badly would like to see this . law changed and then have that choice to just say, as and when I choose, call it a day.' He . was severely injured in a car accident in 1990, which he does not remember, and has no function in . any of his limbs apart from a little movement in his right hand. In . a statement to the courts, the father-of two said: 'I . am in pain every single hour of every single day. I have lived with . these conditions for a lot of years and have given it my best shot . 'Now I feel worn out and I am genuinely fed up with my life. I feel I cannot and do not want to keep living. I feel trapped by the situation and have no way out. 'I spend my day sitting in my wheelchair. My daily routine is tedious, monotonous and pointless. I often go to bed at 5pm - such is the pointlessness of it all. 'I am fed up of going through the motions of life rather than living it. I feel enough is enough.' Case: Mr Lamb is continuing the campaign started by Tony Nicklinson, pictured shortly before his death when he was told his High Court appeal had failed on August 16 . He is seeking a formal statement that . any doctor who helped him to end his life would be doing so out of . 'necessity' and would therefore be immune from prosecution. Mr Nicklinson's widow Jane, who has continued the right-to-die campaign following her husband's death in August, expressed her gratitude to Mr Lamb for bringing his case to public attention. 'He is in constant pain,' she told BBC Breakfast. 'He's had this for 23 years and nothing they do will alleviate the pain and he's had enough. He's just tired of living like this.' Mrs Nicklinson said there was a 'huge amount of support' for a move to change the law, adding: 'In my mind, the severely disabled are being blatantly discriminated against. Why shouldn't they have the same rights as everyone else? 'There would obviously be huge safeguards put in place so that people are protected. I know for a fact that there are many, many severely disabled people or people that have degenerative illnesses that know that one day, they will be severely disabled, that want a change in the law.' Support: Mr Nicklinson's widow Jane, pictured with her daughters Beth and Lauren, is sympathetic to Mr Lamb . Mr Nicklinson was a keen sportsman until he was paralysed by a stroke while on a business trip to Athens in 2005. He was left crestfallen by a High Court decision ruling against his wish to end his life last year, and died a few days later after he began refusing food. Mrs Nicklinson later vowed to continue the legal battle because it was 'part of Tony's legacy'. Mr Lamb said if he won a change in the 'cruel' law to secure protection from prosecution for a doctor who helped him take his life, he would die a 'very proud man'. In an interview broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: 'The quality of life is not there and I just think I have done everything I can, I've tried everything.' He said he was in 'horrendous' pain, adding: 'My will has gone. I think I'm worn down, worn out. I'm not getting any younger and I just badly want to see this law changed.' Mr Lamb said he wanted to be able to die 'with all my loved ones around me that I care about, in my bed, to have the ability to feel comfortable'. Disability charity Scope today strongly opposed any changes to the law and said Mr Lamb's views are not shared by many disabled people. Scope's chief executive, Richard Hawkes, said: 'It is important that the views of Paul Lamb, who has taken up the legal challenge begun by the late Tony Nicklinson, are set in context. 'Although many people will sympathise with these cases, we must remember that the current law on assisted suicide protects the lives of disabled people in Britain. 'Many disabled people tell us that without this legal protection, they would live under the assumption that they are a burden on society more widely and their loved ones. 'We must avoid any temptation to change assisted suicide laws based on a couple of undeniably heart-wrenching and tragic cases. Many disabled people are against any weakening of the law, and their voices need to be heard in this debate.' Nikki Kenward, a disabled former victim of locked-in syndrome who runs the Distant Voices group, said: ‘Just when we thought we might have a place in society, along comes another “my life isn’t worth living” campaign. ‘I’m insulted, alienated and tired of the sense of being on a list of people who qualify for assisted death.’","Paul Lamb, 58, launches case to allow doctor to end his life .

Survivor: After becoming free of a violent relationship, Nikki Howes has trained to be a counsellor so she can help others . When Nikki Howes attended art college when she was 18 with a black eye, her alarmed friends asked her what had happened. 'I was mugged,' she told them - one of the many lies she told during a terrifying two-and-a-half-year period when she was in fact being attacked by her boyfriend. Nikki had met her abusive ex, David, when she started at university in Brighton and had no idea how violent he would become. She told MailOnline: 'He was charming and fun and completely swept me off my feet. He could be intense at times but I had no idea how aggressive he could be. He was my first serious boyfriend and I had low self-esteem at the time, I was flattered by his attention.' Nikki said their relationship moved quickly and after meeting in September 1998, she moved in with him just before Christmas. While she had seen David drinking on nights out, she hadn't been aware just how much he was also consuming at home. 'Sometimes he would down a bottle of wine a night and more than that at weekends,' she said. It was while he was under the influence of alcohol that he would often become violent. Nikki revealed the first time he attacked her was after they had been to his brother's birthday party. He had been wound up by something as simply as her choice of outfit. 'Before we left David had complained about the cardigan I was wearing saying it was 'ugly' and he was embarrassed to be seen with me in it,' she recalls. 'I didn't understand why it upset him so much. After his brother's party ended he also became fixated on the idea that I had flirted with one of his brother's friends. 'When we got home things got much worse. He shouted and screamed at me and was so abusive, the night ended with him punching me in the ear and throwing a mirror at me. 'The next day my ear was ringing and David was in tears, saying he was sorry and it would never happen again.' This began to become a pattern in their relationship with David getting abusive over the slightest thing Nikki did and then begging her for forgiveness the next day. Nikki said: 'He hated it if I wore clothes he didn't like or if he thought I was dressing provocatively. He'd also get mad if I did well at university and would destroy some of my artwork so I'd have to do it again.' 'He pushed me to the floor and pounded my . head against it over and over. When I came free of him I locked myself . in the bathroom the rest of the night, I was terrified' She added: 'He didn't like me having friends - male or female. It got to the point where I couldn't even mention another man's name. 'Once I made the mistake of mentioning an ex when we were in the midst of boiling the kettle and he threw the water over me. Another time, he chased me with a meat cleaver when I talked about a man in my class at college. 'Then he became fixated with my female friends, he became convinced they were lesbians who wanted to sleep with me.' It was 'crazy' Nikki admits now but she succumbed to his wishes and isolated herself more from her friends. Terrifying: Nikki said her boyfriend abused her for more than two years, she once ended up in hospital (posed by models) She also didn't turn to her family as her sister was struggling with bipolar disorder, and she didn't want to worry her parents further. Nikki said David often went for her head and neck when he attacked her. She passed off her black eyes and bruises when people quizzed her at university as clumsiness, falling off her bike or even being mugged. After one particularly violent episode where he repeatedly bashed her head against the floor, Nikki ended up in hospital. She said David showered her with gifts on her release and promised he would never hurt her again. Her vulnerability and feelings for him meant she forgave him again. 'It took me some time in counselling to understand that what had happened was not my fault' 'I was confused and frightened,' Nikki said. 'He would always be so sorry and so charming afterwards. He said he needed me and couldn't live without me. 'As I had few friends and I didn't feel like I could turn to my family, I felt like he was all I had. I had lost all my confidence and didn't feel sure of myself.' Nikki eventually told her father what was happening after a horrific night with David in which she feared he would kill her. She said: 'It was New Years Eve 2001 and the first time David became abusive in public when he was drunk. He was abusive to a friend of mine in a taxi, then when we were chucked out of the cab, he shouted at me the whole way home. When we got to the house, he threw me up against a wall and held my neck trying to strangle me. 'Then he pushed me to the floor and pounded my head against it over and over. When I came free of him I locked myself in the bathroom the rest of the night, I was terrified. 'In the morning I told him what he had done and told him to leave, he then picked up a knife and threatened to kill himself. I ran upstairs and locked myself in the bathroom again, not knowing what to do. I thought he would kill me. I rang my father who came and threw David and all his belongings out.' Nikki, now 34, said it took time to get over the relationship and she lived in fear of David pursuing her for a time. He did turn up once to one of her art exhibitions and tried to friend her on Facebook but Nikki ignored him on both occasions. She said: 'It took me some time in counselling to understand that what had happened was not my fault. I learnt about the wheel of power and control and how perpetrators use emotional as well as sometimes physical abuse to keep their victim scared. 'It took me a long time to admit to others that I was a survivor of domestic violence as I was so full of shame that it had happened to me. The truth is it can happen to anyone.' Control: Nikki said her ex made her feel confused and frightened, she doubted her own mind and had no confidence (posed by models) Nikki, now 34, has since rebuilt her life in London. She has trained to be a counsellor and found love again with a man who she said makes her 'very happy.' They have been together seven years and live with their pet cats. Through the website www.hope2heal.co.uk, she now helps other people deal with their problems - whether that's surviving domestic abuse, beating addiction or coping with bereavement. For anyone who is trapped in a cycle of abuse like she once was, she recommends they seek support as soon as possible. 'You might think it, but you are never alone,' she said. 'If you don't have friends or family you can turn to there are local services like refuges available. They can help you leave an abusive partner and help you explore your legal position. 'You can take out a restraining order or even prosecute. I wish at the time I had more knowledge about the legal system and domestic violence, as now it is too late to prosecute David. 'I can also understand why women suffering domestic violence may be afraid to leave but there are people out there who can support and empower you.'","Nikki Howes started a relationship with 'charming' David when she was 18 and had no idea of the monster he would become .

To her fans she is the archetypal working-class heroine. Geordie accent? Check. Coal-miner father? Check. Cramped terrace home in a down-at-heel but close-knit community? Once upon a time . . . but not any more. Times are changing for stand-up comedian Sarah Millican and as she wakes up this morning in her gated mansion in Cheshire’s stockbroker belt, she will not be worrying about the mortgage repayments. With five bedrooms, a library, conservatory and enough garage space for four cars, there is no shortage of space either. Especially considering her only housemates are Gary Delaney, her fellow comedian and partner of seven years, and a pair of cats (the younger of whom is named Lieutenant Ripley after the heroine of the Alien movies). Millican may still have the common touch on stage, but accounts revealed this week that the company through which she runs her affairs had nearly £2.5million in the bank this time last year — £2million more than in 2011. Her luxurious home, nestled in the leafy fringes of Mere in Cheshire, cost her £1.3million when she bought it in 2012. This is a woman who in five years has gone from a virtual unknown to one of the best-paid comedians on the planet. More to the point, she has done so by staying true to herself and her working-class roots. Only a few months ago, she was living in the rented flat in the heart of Manchester she had called home for six years. It was on one of the busiest roads and not far from some of the toughest estates. Her boyfriend lived 80 miles away in Birmingham — an endless source of gags for her stage routine. But the time had come to start living according to her means. And as she does so, her former husband Andrew — the man whose walk-out devastated and inspired her — will be looking on with envy. Where precisely that will be, no one knows, for he has disappeared since his former wife hit the big time. While Sarah, 37, has spoken at length about her divorce — indeed, her first stand-up routine was based on it — until now very little has been known about the man who propelled her to success by tearing her life apart. In interviews and on stage she has refused to identify him, while going into forensic detail in her act about the day he calmly informed her he didn’t love her and was leaving. This week, however, I spoke to Andrew’s sister at her semi-detached home in Jarrow, Tyne & Wear. Michelle Millican, 38, who was a full-time carer for her mother until she died earlier this year, told me: ‘Andrew broke Sarah’s heart, but that’s what my brother is like. Everyone knows he’s a bit of an a***hole. Sarah, 37, has spoken at length about her divorce - but very little is known about the man who propelled her to success by tearing her life apart . ‘We lost our mother a few months ago and I couldn’t even get hold of him to tell him. He would always do that — he goes off for a couple of years at a time and comes back as if nothing has happened. But not this time. The last time I saw him was at our dad’s funeral ten years ago. ‘None of his friends know where he is now, no one in the family. I spoke to Sarah recently to see if she knows where he is and she doesn’t have a clue. She doesn’t want to know. She prefers to cut all ties and I don’t blame her. For all we know he might have changed his name.’ Sarah has made no secret of the fact her divorce, which came out of the blue ten years ago, prompted her to take the plunge as a stand-up comedian. She had met Andrew at the age of 21 when they worked in a cinema on the outskirts of Newcastle. Within a year they had caught a flight to Las Vegas to get married. They settled into a workaday life, with Sarah taking a job as a civil servant, while home was a series of cramped maisonettes. It was a humdrum, but — to Sarah’s mind at least — happy existence. That illusion was shattered overnight when Andrew dumped her. At 29, stripped of all optimism and self-belief, she moved back in with her parents. By her own account, she would spend hours lying face down on her sister’s bed, sobbing. But on other days she felt strangely energised and started attending evening classes to develop her stagecraft. Within a year she was performing stand-up in comedy clubs and became runner-up in the BBC New Comedy Awards. While still playing small venues, she took great encouragement from the crowd reactions and spent the next three years honing her craft until she was ready to make her Edinburgh Festival debut. The show, Sarah Millican’s Not Nice (based on her divorce), took the Newcomer Award. She has not looked back. Since then she has become a regular on panel shows, played sell-out tours across the country, had her own Radio 4 show, released two smash-hit live DVDs and last year was given her own series on BBC2, The Sarah Millican  Television Programme. One critic described her as ‘the most rapidly evolved national treasure in British light entertainment, basking in ubiquity’. Sarah has become a regular on panel shows and last year was given her own series . That was two years ago and she has not slowed down since then. ‘The person you see on stage is totally her,’ says Michelle. ‘All the little stories she tells about her dad, they’re all just real life. It reminds me of when we used to have a glass of wine together, sit and tell family stories. That’s just the way she tells them on stage. ‘Her dad’s the same. They don’t mean to be especially funny — that’s the way they are. They’re a family of comedians. ‘I’m so pleased Sarah is moving in with her new lad. I love her. ‘Some people have been surprised by how well she’s done, but I’m not. Most comedians do the circuit for years and years before they’re even heard of, but she’s so amazing she just pinged into it straight away.’ All this success has brought material rewards, though such is the nature of showbusiness that it is only in the past couple of years that Sarah has been pulling in bigger pay cheques. Accounts for her company, SM Comedy, show that in 2011 she had an income of £590,000. Last year the company’s earnings leapt by £2 million and continue to grow. Nevertheless, with another successful DVD released since then, a record-breaking tour called Chatterbox under her belt and another 130 dates lined up over the next year, those earnings are only going to go up. Accounts for Sarah's company, SM Comedy show an income of £2.5million in 2012 . Her website is full of merchandising offers, including signed DVDs at £15 each (which, given the DVD normally costs £6, means that her signature is valued at £9). Small wonder she has moved into more salubrious surroundings, with her new neighbours including the solicitor Nick ‘Mr Loophole’ Freeman and Coronation Street legend Barbara Knox, who plays Rita Tanner. The houses are hidden away behind high walls, hedges and electronic gates, and are just a short distance from the picturesque 1,000-acre Tatton Park. The nearest town is Knutsford, where the car salesrooms are Rolls-Royce and McLaren (one of only three garages in the country to sell the super- expensive sports cars). She has come a long way from South Shields, yet it is telling that through it all she has kept her former husband’s name (she was born Sarah King). Her normality (she professes to prefer ‘watching telly’ to reading books) masks an extraordinary dedication to the job. She does not drink and drives 50,000 miles a year to performances. One of the main reasons she chose her new mansion was its proximity to the M6. Success has also bred a degree of suspicion and she can be extremely guarded in interviews. While her act consists of cheerfully spilling intimate tales (such as the occasion when she lost control of her bladder in a car and blamed it on a friend’s dog), off-stage she goes to great lengths to keep her private life private. This penchant for mystery may well be the last thing she has in common with her former husband. He marked his 40th birthday last month without making any attempt to contact family or friends from home. But his sister feels confident he would be ‘torn apart’ by his former wife’s success. ‘One thing I can tell you for sure is that he’ll be absolutely raging about Sarah because he was very money-orientated,’ says Michelle. ‘That used to be the only time Mum and Dad would see him: if he wanted cash. ‘So I think the green-eyed monster will be there, which, to be honest, I think is quite good because after what he did he deserves it. ‘Sarah knows that as well. She was devastated by what he did to her. But she now knows she’s definitely got the better of the deal.’ Loose Women .","Comedian was dumped by former husband Andrew aged 29 .

A knifeman is facing jail after stabbing another man with such force that the the weapon got stuck nearly three inches in his skull. James Johnson, 21, spent 10 days in a coma, had to undergo lifesaving surgery and has a metal plate in his skull after the brutal attack in Harwich, Essex, by Kyle Ogilvie, 22. Ogilvie was today told at Chelmsford Crown Court that he faces a lengthy prison sentence after being found guilty of attempted murder. James Johnson, pictured left, has been left scarred by the attack of Kyle Ogilvie, pictured right posing with a sword, who had bragged about sticking the knife in . The jury heard the Ogilvie had bragged of the attack after a party in Harwich, Essex, and told a group of women: 'That guy, that's hurt. I just stuck a knife in the side of his head.' Ogilvie, from Harwich, showed no emotion as the unanimous guilty verdict was read out by the jury after eight hours deliberation. Judge Charles Gratwicke, remanded Ogilvie in custody telling him: 'Prepare yourself for a lengthy prison sentence.' After the verdicts Mr Johnson's mother, June Rawlinson, praised the community for coming forward to help . convict the attempted murderer. Mrs Rawlinson, James's adoptive mother, said: 'I am over the moon. In May Kyle . tried to take my son's life but on Thursday the jury took his. 'I was sitting in court on Wednesday for the closing statements reading . what the judge was reading and I had a little thing in the back of my . mind that Kyle might not be found guilty. 'But . everyone has been so supportive to keep me going, I am taken aback. James seems over the moon. I don't think it has sunk in for him yet . though.' Victim James Johnson and his mum June Rawlinson, pictured, are said to be 'over the moon' at the verdicts . The court heard that Ogilvie struck on Mill Lane, Harwich on May 6, lashing out with such force that that blade penetrated Mr Johnson's head by almost three inches. It took a delicate operation to remove the knife and Mr Johnson was in a coma for ten days but made a miraculous recovery. Kyle Ogilvie, pictured, denied attempted murder but was found guilty by a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court after they heard how he bragged about the attack . Ogilvie denied trying to kill Mr Johnson but refused to go into the witness box during his trial. But he was convicted after the three week trial heard how he bragged about what he had done to friends and others at the scene. Ogilvie had been thrown out of a house in Mill Lane, Harwich after he got involved in a fight with another man and had picked up a kitchen knife before he left. At the same time Mr Johnson was one his way home after watching DVD at his adoptive parents' house when Ogilvie attacked him. Witnesses saw Mr Johnson staggering around with the knife sticking out of his head. As he walked off, Ogilvie was heard telling a group of women: 'It's okay girls, I'm not going to hurt you. That guy, that's hurt. I just stuck a knife in the side of his head.' He made a panicked early morning phone call to a friend the next day and said he had stabbed someone but did not mean it. He was interviewed at least five times by police probing the incident but declined to answer questions. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Parkes said: 'Just carrying a weapon is idiotic. Taking one to a fight is pure madness. 'Ogilvie said that he had consumed . so much alcohol he cannot remember the incident. The drink and the . knife made a toxic combination. 'The speed with which he was . arrested, with the assistance from the local community, means he will . now be imprisoned for some time to reflect on his actions.' Gareth Hughes, defending, blamed another man for the attack, but the jury rejected the excuses. The attack took place in Mill Lane in Harwich, Essex, pictured. Police say being drunk and armed proved a 'toxic combination' for Kyle Ogilvie . Mrs Rawlinson, who lives in Harwich, travelled to the court twice to hear evidence and closing statements during the trial. She said: 'It was choking hearing what I heard in court, witnesses saying what Kyle had said to them afterwards. 'The community raised up to speak out. It shows people have consciences and they did the right thing and came forward. 'It could have been anyone's brother, uncle or son but it happened to be my boy.' She said she is looking forward to a quiet family Christmas and she said she was thankful her family could be together.","Witnesses saw victim staggering with the kitchen knife in his cheek .

"By . Christopher Leake . UPDATED: . 11:24 EST, 29 January 2012 . The wife of disgraced British-born tycoon Alan Bond has been found dead at the couple’s luxury beachside mansion. It is understood the body of former airline stewardess Diana Bliss, 57, was found by her husband floating in the swimming pool and that he tried desperately to resuscitate her. Flamboyant Bond – who was jailed for fraud, lost a fortune and bounced back to make another – may have raised the alarm himself. Tragedy: Millionaire Alan Bond (right) discovered his wife Diana Bliss (left) dead in the swimming pool at their home in Perth, Western Australia . Luxury: Miss Bliss, 57, is believed to have been found by Mr Bond floating in the pool of their home (pictured) Neighbours in Cottesloe, a suburb of Perth in Western Australia, said Ms Bliss had been struggling with personal problems. Residents said she had lost a lot  of . weight recently and had been  battling anxiety and depression for . several years. One said she had received treatment for depression in a . London clinic last year. Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I saw her a week ago and she looked terrible.’ Police said last night that there were . no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Australian-born Ms . Bliss, the daughter of a Methodist minister. A police spokesman said: ‘About . 11.30am local time, Western Australian Police were notified by St John . Ambulance of a deceased woman at Hawkstone Street, Cottesloe.’ The spokesman said a report would be sent to the coroner. The tragedy comes 12 years after . Bond’s daughter Susanne Edwards – the second of his four children – died . at her Perth home aged 41 after apparently overdosing on prescription . drugs. Aerial view: The swimming pool in the back garden of the couple's mansion is circled in red . Ms Bliss, who had worked as a Qantas . flight attendant, in public relations and later as a successful theatre . producer, married Bond in 1995 after he had been discharged as a . bankrupt. He was divorced from his first wife, Eileen, three years earlier. Bond, 73, who emigrated with his . parents from London to Australia in 1950, began as a signwriter but went . on to become a multi-millionaire whose investments in airships, . property, breweries and diamond mines enabled him to bankroll challenges . for the America’s Cup, the premier international yacht race. In 1983, his Australia II Syndicate won the trophy, which had been  held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851. Death: Miss Bliss was Mr Bond's second wife and had stood by him despite his time in jail and bankruptcy . In 1987, Bond controversially bought . Vincent van Gogh’s Irises for £36 million – at the time the highest . price paid for a single painting. But the purchase was subsidised by a . substantial loan from auctioneer Sotheby’s, which Bond failed to repay. Art experts suggested it may have been a manipulated sale designed to . artificially inflate the value. After his empire collapsed, Bond was . declared bankrupt in 1992 with personal debts of £1.2 billion. He was . jailed for seven years in 1997 after pleading guilty to using his . controlling interest in the Bell Resources company to siphon off more . than £800 million into the  coffers of his Bond Corporation. He served . four years in jail and since then he has worked with his son, Craig, to . build up a new fortune in oil and diamonds. By 2008, Bond was said to be worth about £170 million.

A 'possessive' mechanic launched a bloody attack on his lover as her two children screamed in fear because he thought she was cheating on him, a court heard today. Lee Birks, 27, was jailed for 18 months for launching the frenzied assault on Natalie Ranson as she tried to keep him away from her children who were just feet away in the bath. He had head-butted her twice in the face before pummeling her with his fists  when they argued about her ex-lover and a  man she was in contact with on Facebook. The beating left her needing surgery to repair her nose. Horrific: Natalie Ranson said Lee Birks made her life 'absolute hell' on the night he beat her unconscious as her children screamed in the bath. Her injuries, picture, left her needing surgery . During the attack at her home in Werrington, Staffordshire, on May 17 this year, Birks initially threw Miss Ranson's laptop against a wall and stamped on it before hurling a glass against the kitchen wall. He then punched a television in the bedroom before head-butting helpless Miss Ranson twice in the face and thumping her in the right eye causing her to lose consciousness. The attack, which left Miss Ranson with horrific facial injuries, happened just feet away from her children, aged four and 18 months. Jailing Birks, Judge Paul Glenn told him: 'You had been in a relationship from 2008. 'She described you as jealous and possessive during that relationship. Jealous: Despite being left bloodied Natalie Ranson, pictured right, was most concerned for her children who were in the bath when Lee Birks, left, flew into a rage . 'On May 17 you argued, it was about one of her ex-partners and Facebook contact she allegedly had with someone you knew. 'You had drunk alcohol and became increasingly angry and ignored a request to leave. 'This young lady was a vulnerable victim, a single mother. Her injuries were unpleasant. It was a repeated assault. 'When you head-butt people, that equates to using a weapon. The aggravating features are a conviction for a previous assault on the same victim and the presence of two young children.' After battering his lover, Birks fled the house before being arrested later that day when she came round and dialled 999. Speaking after the case, Miss Ranson, who had to undergo surgery on her nose, described a sense of relief after her 'terrifying ordeal' came to an end. The full-time mum said: 'Lee started going off on one. I just asked him to leave. I could see the anger in his eyes. Guilty: Lee Birks, pictured outside Hanley Crown Court, Stoke-On-Trent, smashed up his lovers home before head-butting her and punching her in the face . 'I was checking on the children who were in the bath. I heard a loud noise. My laptop had been slung on one side of the room. 'Lee was in a rage. I went up to the children. I came downstairs. Lee threw the glass at the kitchen wall. 'I was just asking him to leave. He then went upstairs, the children were still in the bath. I went upstairs because I did not want him anywhere near my children. 'Lee was in my bedroom. I told him to get out the house. He swung around and punched my television. It was in pieces. 'He came towards me and head-butted me. I think I lost consciousness. He head-butted me twice. My nose was pouring with blood. 'I was in a complete and utter daze. I did not know what had gone on.

'I am still suffering because I need surgery on my nose to replace the cartilage that was damaged.

The International Space Station will receive a historic package tomorrow - a parcel delivered by the first private company to successfully launch a module in to space. The Dragon space capsule, launched on Tuesday, signals the dawn of a new 'space race', but one founded on profit and competition rather than nationalistic pride. Today the unmanned module will fly-by the ISS, passing by at a 1.5 miles, a tiny distance considering the distances involved. Scroll down for video of Tuesday's launch: . Off we go: The Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket is seen during a time exposure as it lifts off Cape Canaveral this morning, flying off to the ISS . Today, SpaceX and NASE will remotely test the Dragon capsule's sensors and flight systems to check the module can berth with the ISS, which includes the 1.5 mile fly-by. If NASA gives the green light, the Dragon will then approach the ISS on Friday. The planned docking will be the first time a private ship has docked with the ISS. The crew onboard the ISS will then use the station's robotic arm to capture the capsule as it drifts by, and then attach it to the orbiting research outpost. The hatch of the Dragon will then open on Saturday to give the ISS a gift - 521 kilograms of cargo for the space lab. On the last day of the month, Dragon will then depart back for Earth, hopefully splashing safely down in the Pacific. The test flight of SpaceX's capsule, launched on the company's Falcon 9 rocket, will hopefully help America re-establish access to the ISS, after NASA retired its space shuttle fleet last year. NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries told AFP: 'So far everything is going as planned', and said there was a 'sense of optimism' among the mission control team. He added the capsule has completed the first part of its demonstration flight, including navigating via GPS, testing its reaction to an 'abort' demonstration, and a demonstration of 'free drift', a mode often used when interacting with the ISS. The private space cargo firm's historic launch to the International Space Station blasted off at 8.44BST on Tuesday, carrying with it a capsule loaded with 1,000lbs of space station provisions. Also on-board are the ashes of Star Trek legend James 'Scotty' Doohan, fulfilling his final wish to spend eternity resting in space. Up, up and away! Sparks fly as the rocket leaves the launch pad and heads to the horizons . While in space today, Dragon will go through a series of tests and will pass around one and a half miles below the station to see if its controls are testing properly. If that checks out OK, the ISS will allow the Dragon capsule to within 10 feet and pull it in for docking all the while traveling at 17,500 mph. Staying on board the space station for a week and a half, it will then be re-loaded and sent back to Earth where it will land in the Pacific and be retrieved. The mission is the first by a private company to the $100billion orbital outpost, a project of 15 countries. NASA is investing in SpaceX, as well as four other companies, to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles last summer. The first attempt on Saturday stalled, as the countdown reached all the way to practically zero before there was an automatic shutdown by on-board computers. So instead of blasting off from Cape Canaveral on a delivery mission to the International Space Station, the rocket remained on its launch pad amid a cloud of engine exhaust. The rocket is lost against the inky-black sky during the pre-dawn launch at Cape Canaveral, but the flames light up the surroundings . Standing tall: Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft, pictured a day before its first launch, are in the final stages of preparation for their historic flightute safely (left) and to splash down in the Pacific (right) Only governments have completed such a feat to date, with the SpaceX voyage the first time such a voyage has been completed by a private firm. Ferrying the Dragon capsule into space, the mission to the ISS will be to deliver 1,000 pounds of non-essential cargo after passing a series of test maneuvers over the course of three days. If successful in its first-of-a kind mission, the company behind the venture SpaceX would collect the remaining payments on the $396 million contract it has with NASA and then enter into a $1.6 billion agreement for 11 more flights to the ISS. The first step in the commercialisation of space to non-governmental firms, SpaceX is hoping one day to deliver up to seven passengers to the ISS and other destinations in low-Earth orbit.",Module will pass the ISS from a distance of just 1.5 miles while tests are carried out .

She often seems happier in scruffy jeans and trainers than a posh frock. But it seems Kristen Stewart still has a few fashion lessons for her British contemporaries. The tomboy American actress has been declared the world’s best-dressed woman, ahead of Harry Potter star Emma Watson and the Duchess of Cambridge. It is the second year in a row Miss Stewart has topped the annual fashion list compiled by Glamour magazine. The 23-year-old Twilight star was praised for her ‘personal rock-chick style’. Although she sometimes embraces high fashion on the red carpet, she often dresses down in her free time. She once admitted she can sometimes be found wanting in the fashion stakes, saying: ‘I go outside, and I’m wearing a funky T-shirt and my hair is dirty, and people say, ‘‘What’s wrong with her? She needs to invest in a hairbrush’’. Miss Watson, also 23, remained in second place. In recent years she has ditched her innocent image as a child star with a series of sultry photoshoots and risqué film roles. However, she has admitted struggling to look sexy in the past, saying: . ‘I find the whole concept of being ‘sexy’ embarrassing and confusing. 'If . I do a photo-shoot people desperately want to change me - dye my hair . blonder, pluck my eyebrows, give me a fringe. ‘Then there’s the . choice of clothes. 'I know everyone wants a picture of me in a . mini-skirt. 'But that’s not me. I feel uncomfortable. I’d never go out in . a mini-skirt. 'It’s nothing to do with protecting the Hermione image. I . wouldn’t do that. ‘Personally, I don’t actually think it’s even that . sexy. Runners-up: The Twilight star came ahead of Harry Potter star Emma Watson, left, and the Duchess of Cambridge, right . What’s sexy about saying, ‘I’m here with my boobs out and a short . skirt...have a look at everything I’ve got’? My idea of sexy is that . less is more. The less you reveal the more people can wonder.’ The Duchess of Cambridge moved up one place to third. The 31-year-old royal has been praised for her demure outfits during her pregnancy. Her sister Pippa Middleton jumped 32 places to 15. Also in the top five were Spider-Man star Emma Stone and singer Taylor Swift. Other names in the top 50 include Kate Moss, Keira Knightley and actress Lily Collins, daughter of Phil.

The 32-year-old, who vanished in 2002, was found at a Cleveland home on Monday with two other women and a six-year-old girl - but she has not yet contacted her mother for a reunion. The first details about Michelle are emerging as images of her have finally been released. They show her as a teenager before she was kidnapped - at a time when she endured an often troubled relationship with her family. She had given birth to a son who was later taken into the custody of child services, and authorities suggested to her mother that she may have fled following the upset from the ordeal. Scroll down for video . First pictures: Michelle Knight, who is now 32, is pictured as a teenager before her disappearance in 2002 . Barbara Knight left her home in Naples, Florida, on Tuesday to head to Cleveland to see Michelle but the mother and daughter have not yet been reunited, she told the Today show. Barbara, 50, said she never gave up . hope and will . now be able to introduce Michelle to the half sister she has never met, . 10-year-old Katie, who was born after she disappeared. Katie was with her mother as they left for the airport on Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday, Barbara spoke to the Today show about how she had never given up hope that her daughter was alive - but that she was led to believe the woman, then in her 20s, had fled. 'Certain people said she didn't want . nothing to do with me but still in my heart I thought no, because I knew . my Michelle,' she said. 'They figured she just left because of . the baby and everything. No contact: Michelle's mother Barbara, pictured, said she has not yet been reunited with her daughter . Troubled: She told Savannah Guthrie some people told her Michelle had wanted nothing to do with her . '[Police] told me if she breaks the law or they spot her, they'll let me know - but nothing happened.' Barbara, who said she filed a missing persons report after Michelle vanished and continued to search for her, said her sons have been reunited with Michelle but she has not yet seen her. 'I just wish that my daughter would reach out and let me know that she's there... She's probably angry at the world because she thought she would never be found but thank God that somebody did,' she said. 'I don't want her to think that I forgot about her... Hopefully whatever happened between us, if something did - I hope it heals because I really want to take her back to Florida with me.' Sources told Fox 8 that Michelle appears to have facial bone damage from her horrific treatment. But Barbara said that she knew little about what had happened to Michelle since she last saw her as she has not spoken with detectives, she said. 'There was a detective who called me but he just said it was my daughter,' she said, adding that she missed his call and that he had left work when she called back. 'I didn't get a hold of anyone.' Family: Barbara Knight's 10-year-old daughter is seen outside their home in Florida before they leave for Ohio . En route to Ohio: None of the Knight family spoke to reporters before they were driven off at speed in a white car with New York license plates . Instead, she only knows the details from watching news reports. While . the stories of missing Cleveland girls Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry, who were also found on Monday, . have remained high-profile cases over the last decade, little is known . of Michelle. While . family appeals for Gina and Amanda have been frequent and . well-publicized over the past ten years, her case appears to have been . long forgotten. Now believed to be aged around 32, Michelle was in her early twenties when she . was last seen on August 23, 2002, at her cousin's house near West 106th . Street and Lorain Avenue. Mrs . Knight said she would often put up fliers around Cleveland's West Side . and even after moving away she would return to continue the search on . her own as police were little help. Michelle Knight's grandmother, Deborah Knight, said the family, after speaking with police and social workers, had accepted that she likely left on her own free will. They believed she was angry that her son had been taken into custody. High-profile: The missing person cases of Amanda Berry, left, and Gina DeJesus, right, were well-known to people in Cleveland - but the disappearance of Michelle Knight drew little attention . Found: The women were found at this home in Cleveland on Monday after Berry managed to escape . Barbara Knight previously told The . Plain Dealer that Michelle vanished shortly after she was scheduled for a . court appearance in the custody case of her son. The mother told the paper that she had become involved with an abusive man whom she thinks injured her toddler grandson, eventually leading Michelle to lose the boy. Michelle had him as a teenager; . her mother said that she had been assaulted at school but it was never . taken seriously by police. She then fell pregnant soon after and dropped . out of school. Michelle was never registered as missing on the Ohio Missing Persons website. Mrs Knight told The Plain Dealer she . believes she once saw her daughter walking with an older man at a . shopping mall several years ago. When the woman trailed behind her companion, he would grab her by the arm and pull her along, she said. Brothers: From left, Ariel, Onil and Pedro have all been arrested in connection with the abduction of Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight almost ten years ago . Barbara was 'calmly' looking forward . to the reunion according to neighbors in Naples, where she lives with . her second husband Tom Hudson and members of his family. 'It's an emotional time for them,' said Sheldon Gofberg who lives across the street from the family's house . in the southwest Florida town. 'They didn’t get any sleep last night.' Mr . Gofberg said neighbours had no idea that Barbara was the mother of a . missing girl and that she appeared to have her hands full looking after . Katie and helping with Tom's two children, Julian, 16, and his sister . Alex, 8. 'They're a friendly family, Tom would do anything to help you, give you the shirt off his back,' Mr Gofberg said. Despite the turmoil, Tom kept a commitment with Mr Gofberg to take him to a Home Depot. 'We . were in the car driving and Tom said, ""You know those three girls they . found in the house in Cleveland? One of them was Barbara’s daughter."" I was astounded,' he said. Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were found at this house in Cleveland, Ohio . Hero: Neighbour Charles Ramsey tells reporters of the moment he rescued the three women from the house . 'I said, ""She's got to be pretty emotional?"" and he said, ""Not really because we’ve been waiting to hear back from the FBI"".' The . family had refused to talk to reporters and TV crews waiting outside their home, . sending the teenage boy Julian, who was wearing an ankle monitoring . bracelet, outside to ask them to leave. After 10 years being held against their will, the three women were finally freed after neighbor Charles Ramsey, heard screaming from the house and helped them escape through a door. When Amanda fled the home and ran across the street to call police, she was holding the hand of a young girl. 'Help me I'm Amanda Berry...I've been . kidnapped and I've been missing for ten years and I'm here. I'm free . now,' Berry is heard saying in the call to police that has been publicly . released.","Michelle vanished on August 23, 2002 near her cousin's Cleveland home .

A judge has condemned the Church of England and social services for a cover-up that allowed a vicar who sexually abused a teenage orphan to escape justice for 26 years. John Yallop, a married father of four, had been offering bereavement counselling to the 16-year-old girl just months after she lost her entire family. He admitted the abuse, which took place over two months, when confronted by a social worker. But instead of reporting him to police, the Bishop of Sheffield and social services chiefs hushed up the scandal and Yallop, then 40, was allowed to leave his job and move away from the area to restart his life. The victim, now aged 42, has suffered depression and suicidal thoughts ever since. She eventually reported Yallop, now 65, to police in January last year after discovering he was again carrying out religious  services and wanted to become a foster parent with his new wife. He initially claimed to be innocent, forcing his victim to relive her ordeal by giving evidence at his trial in February. But the case was cut short for legal reasons and Yallop decided to plead guilty to six counts of indecent assault. As Judge Simon Lawler QC jailed him for three years at Sheffield Crown Court, he hit out at the authorities responsible for the cover-up and said those still alive ‘should reproach themselves’. The matter had been ‘swept under the carpet – the church elders were not concerned about her, but more the damage that publicity would do to the church’. Attack: He abused his position and sexually assaulted his victim in the vicarage when his wife was downstairs, in his car and even in the foyer of St Peter's Church (pictured) in Ellesmere, Sheffield, where he worked . The court heard the teenage girl was an only child from Sheffield orphaned when her father, mother and grandmother all died over eight months in 1987. She was referred to Yallop, who conducted her mother’s funeral, for bereavement counselling. But he abused his position and sexually assaulted her in the vicarage when his wife was downstairs, in his car and even in the foyer of St Peter’s Church in Ellesmere, Sheffield, where he worked. The girl eventually confided in her social worker Charlotte Swain, who interviewed Yallop. Sarah Wright, prosecuting, said the original notes of the interview still exist and Yallop gave a full admission of his sexual abuse. At a meeting with church elders ‘it was decided to not involve the police’. The judge said the social worker’s concerns were overruled. 'I have got what I wanted, which is to protect other children and for the truth to come out' Victim of John Yallop . He added the decision by church officials, the Bishop of Sheffield at the time, David Lunn, and social services chiefs had ‘devastating effects’ on the victim. Yallop moved 40 miles to Blackburn, Lancashire, where his victim - now married and living in South Yorkshire - discovered that he was managing the St Barnabas Church and Community Centre. After the case, she said: ‘I have got what I wanted, which is to protect other children and for the truth to come out.’ The current Bishop of Sheffield, Dr Steven Croft, apologised to her and agreed that church authorities mishandled the case. Last night Mr Lunn, 82, insisted he was not involved in any cover-up. He added: ‘The issue was not a problem with an underage person but an inappropriate relationship with an adult member of the congregation. This caused his instant resignation and retirement from the parish.’","John Yallop was offering counselling to girl months after she lost family .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:05 EST, 8 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:13 EST, 8 May 2013 . Captivated jurors in a Cincinnati murder trial watched video Tuesday that prosecutors say shows a dying, paralyzed shooting victim who couldn't speak identifying a photo of his killer by blinking his eyes. Over the unsuccessful and repeated objections of defense attorneys, prosecutors showed the jury a 17-minute video of shooting victim David Chandler, 35, in which he answers detectives' questions by blinking twice to say ‘no’ and three times for ‘yes.’ Ricardo Woods, 35, is charged with Chandler's October 2010 murder and has pleaded not guilty. Scroll down to watch blinking video . Eye contact: Shooting victim David Chandler blinked his eyes hard three times, opening them wide in between each blink, after he was shown a picture of Ricardo Woods and asked if he was his attacker . Impassive: Woods (second left) sat quietly next to his attorneys as the video of Chandler blinking was shown to the jury . Prosecutors say that in the video, Chandler clearly identifies Woods as his attacker, while Woods' attorneys argue that his blinks were inconsistent and unreliable. The video is considered the key piece of evidence in the trial. Jurors will have to determine whether Chandler appears alert and knew what he was doing when he said ‘yes’ to Woods' photo. In the video, police have to repeat some questions when Chandler fails to respond or when the number of times he blinks is unclear. But when police show Chandler a picture of Woods and ask him if he was the man who shot him, Chandler looks at it for a couple seconds before blinking his eyes hard three times, opening them wide in between each blink. When police ask him whether he's sure that's the person who shot him, he again blinks three times. All the jurors watched the video closely, some silently moving their lips as they appeared to count the blinks and some taking notes. One woman appeared upset by the video, which shows a clearly struggling Chandler lying in a hospital bed, his face and body connected to tubes and machines, his vital signs on display in the background. Woods, dressed in a brown suit, sat quietly watching the video. Cincinnati police Detective Howard Grant testified earlier in the day that he had ‘no concern at all’ that Chandler understood what he was being asked and pointed out that he'd answered many questions by blinking before being asked to identify the shooter. Incident: David Chandler, left, identified, 34-year-old Ricardo Woods (right), who has now been charged with murder, felonious assault and weapons counts and faces up to life in prison if convicted . Also Tuesday, a jailhouse informant . testified that Woods told him that he killed Chandler because he caught . him buying drugs from someone else while still owing Woods money. The informant, Jermaine Beard, is facing four counts of armed robbery that could carry a prison term of up to 56 years. Defense . attorneys questioned Beard's motives, pointing out that he testified in . two other murder cases and getting him to acknowledge that he was . trying to get a light sentence for himself by helping prosecutors. In . opening statements last week, defense attorney Wendy Calaway told . jurors that Woods did not shoot Chandler, calling him ‘an innocent man . who found himself in a perfect storm of misinformation and . misidentification.’ She said that Chandler had stolen drugs from dealers, was considered a police ‘snitch’ and had many enemies. Paralyzed and hooked up to a . ventilator, David Chandler was two weeks from death when police arrived . at his hospital room to question him about the person who shot him. They . wanted to know if he could identify a suspect, and they had a photo to . show him. Suspect: Ricardo Woods is led out of the courtroom last year after the murder trial was postponed . Chandler was unable to communicate . except with his eyes as he lay in bed attached to myriad tubes and with a . brace around his neck. His eyes opened barely more than a slit at . times; he was instructed to blink three times for yes and twice for no. One detective quizzed him, and another videotaped his responses. Chandler . didn't respond with blinks to every question in the 17-minute video, . and there were solo blinks. But triple blinks came in response to . repeated questions asking if he knew the shooter and whether the person . in the photo was the culprit. Legal . experts say such cases - while not unheard of - are unusual, and dying . identifications relying on gestures rather than words are often not used . in trials because of concern over reliability or differing . interpretations. But some have been used in murder cases around the . country that have ended in convictions. Police . asked Chandler to blink three times for yes and twice for no to a . series of questions in the interview, said Assistant Hamilton County . Prosecutor David Prem. Chandler also blinked yes to indicate . that he knew the gunman and that his name began with the letter O, Prem . said. O was a street name that Woods sometimes used, the prosecutor . said. Familiar: Woods reportedly knew the victim through drug deals . The motive for the shooting, the prosecutor said, was that Chandler owed Woods money for drugs. Chandler was a drug user who had . bought drugs many times from Woods but had gone to an area near Woods' home the night of the shooting with two friends to buy drugs from . someone else. Chandler was shot about 20 yards from Woods' home and in an area known for drug deals, he said. Prem said that while neither of the . men in the car with Chandler could clearly identify the man who shot . him, one heard a voice yelling Chandler's name. Defense attorney Wendy Calaway . insisted that Woods did not shoot Chandler. She also focused on the blinking . identification, saying that while doctors were able to establish a 'rudimentary' communication system with Chandler, 'his blinks were . inconsistent and sporadic'. Law: Judge Beth Myers of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court ruled at an earlier hearing that jurors could see the videotape, saying she found the blinks reliable . He only blinked in response to doctors' commands about 50 percent of the time, she said. Both sides are expected to call . medical experts to testify about the ability of someone in Woods' condition to understand and respond to questions. Other witnesses expected to be called . include a priest who was a friend to Chandler and gave him money before . the shooting, Prem said. The judge has said that the trial could take up to three weeks.","David Chandler, 35, was left paralyzed after he was shot and could only communicate by blinking .

But Mrs Rausing's father Tom Kemeny is refusing to blame his son-in-law. In a statement he has paid tribute to 'a beautiful, . generous, and fun daughter, wife, mother, sister and aunt' and described Mr Rausing as his 'son'.

Investigators believe American-born Eva may have been lying dead in an upstairs bedroom for . days when her body was found on July 9 . Mr Rausing, who has been recovering . in a secure hospital after being stopped by police driving erratically . in Wandsworth last week, will now appear before magistrates today. Eva and Hans were married in London¿s Swedish Church by the Archbishop of Sweden in 1992 . Last night a spokesman for the . Metropolitan Police said: 'Hans Kristian Rausing, of Cadogan Place, SW1, . was today charged with preventing the lawful and decent burial of the . body of Eva Rausing on or before 9 July 2012. 'He will appear in custody at West . London Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 18 July.' Police are treating the . death of Mrs Rausing as 'unexplained' and a post-mortem examination . held last week failed to establish a formal cause of death. An inquest into the mother-of-four's death opened at Westminster Coroner's Court on Friday. Mrs Rausing's body was only . discovered after officers stopped her husband on suspicion of driving . under the influence of drugs or alcohol and after finding drugs in his . car, they searched the couple's home . Yesterday Mrs Rausing's devastated . father, Tom Kemeny, said his daughter had interrupted her own drug . treatment to help her husband, who is heir to a £5.4 billion fortune. He wrote: 'At the time of her death . her overriding concern was for the safety of her beloved husband, for . whom she interrupted her own treatment to return to London in an attempt . to take him back with her to California, but tragically to no avail.

Family event: Eva's family said they hoped her death would raise awareness of drug addiction and financial support for those blighted by it. 'Eva and Hans Kristian adored each . other and their four beautiful children. When not in London they would . have family holidays with their cousins and extended family, without any . glitz or glamour. 'Eva and Hans Kristian were a devoted and loving couple for the 21 years they spent together. 'They benefited thousands of lives through their personal involvement and philanthropic activities. 'They bravely battled their demons . and supported each other and Eva will be a devastating loss to our . beloved 'son' Hans Kristian, whom we love unconditionally with all our . hearts.' The couple's drug problems have been widely reported. Eva as a teenager: Her parents described her as a 'philanthropist' who was dedicated to helping others . In 2008 they were investigated by police over drugs but the prosecution was formally discontinued. In a joint statement, Mrs Rausing's . family said they hoped her death would raise awareness of drug addiction . and financial support for those blighted by it. They said: 'The Kemeny family is . deeply distressed by the tragedy of their daughter Eva's death and have . seen the widespread worldwide media coverage of her difficulties over . the last few days. 'Eva would have wanted the memory of . her life to be used to benefit others facing similar addiction . challenges in their lives. The Kemeny family hopes this tribute will be . used to draw attention to the tragedy of drug addiction and to generate . awareness and financial support for this cause in the future.

In a statement released alongside the . tribute, he said: 'We believe her tragic death highlights the scourge of . drugs and that it does not matter how rich, intelligent or beautiful . you are, you can still be impacted and overcome by this terrible . disease.' The tribute also went into great detail about Mrs Rausing's childhood, before paying tribute to her sharp wit and intelligence. It also quotes Nick Barton, chief . executive of Action on Addiction, as saying: 'Eva worked tirelessly for . years, without any desire for public recognition and despite her own . health issues, to help people and charities in the addiction field . through her wonderfully generous support.'

It could be the next big revolution in electronics - gadgets you can simply fold up to put in your pocket. Manufacturers have already given us a glimpse of the technology, with Samsung showing off a 'foldable' phone. Experts say the technology, which could lead to virtually unbreakable gadgets, could soon be seen in everything from Apple's much-rumoured iWatch to larger tablets. Scroll down for video . Eric Rudder, chief technical strategy officer of Microsoft, holds a prototype Samsung Windows smartphone. Experts say the technology could soon become commonplace . Flexible displays are made by depositing organic light emitting diodes on a flexible plastic surface. Regular LED displays are usually made on a glass surface, but substituting that for a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate makes it possible to manufacture screens that are both flexible and lightweight. One possible mass-production method might use a technique similar to inkjet printing. The touted arrival this year of wearable gadgets such as computer displays strapped to wrists and in wrap-around glasses is just a step towards a bigger revolution in screens — those that can be bent, folded and rolled up, experts say. Once freed from today's relatively heavy, breakable and fixed glass displays, tomorrow's devices may look very different, with screens that can be rolled out, attached to uneven surfaces, or even stretched. But there's still some way to go. 'It becomes a product designer's paradise — once the technology is sorted out,' says Jonathan Melnick, who analyzes display technology for Lux Research. There is no shortage of prototypes. South Korea's Samsung Electronics this year showed off a display screen that extends from the side of a device — but obstacles remain: overcoming technical issues, figuring out how to mass produce parts cheaply, and coming up with devices compelling enough for gadget buyers. Screen technology — with the global small display market expected to more than double to around $72 billion by 2016, according to DisplaySearch — is still dominated by liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which require a backlight and sit between two sheets of glass, making the screen a major contributor to the weight of a device, from laptops to tablets. 'Most of the weight in a tablet is . the glass structure in the display and the support structure around it . to prevent it from cracking,' said Kevin Morishige, a former engineer at . Cisco, Hewlett-Packard and Palm. LCD's . dominance is already under threat from lighter Organic Light Emitting . Diodes (OLEDs) that don't need backlighting, are brighter, offer a wider . viewing angle and better color contrast — and can be printed onto a few . layers. Corning's Willow Glass, which can be as thin as a sheet of paper and is flexible enough to be wrapped around a device or structure. Initially, Willow will be used as a coating for products like solar panels, but it is eventually expected to create curved products. However, some manufacturers are already creating lighter and more flexible glass. Corning, whose toughened Gorilla glass became the screen of choice for many smartphones, will provide phones with curved glass edges as soon as this year. It is also now promoting Willow Glass, which can be as thin as a sheet of paper and is flexible enough to be wrapped around a device or structure. Initially, Willow will be used as a coating for products like solar panels, but it is eventually expected to create curved products. A concept for Apple's iWatch shows a design based on the Corning Willow Glass . A key selling point for Willow is more efficient production which involves so-called roll-to-roll manufacturing, like a printing press, rather than today's more costly batch manufacturing. But the commercialization of Willow as a flexible product is some way off, James Clappin, who heads Corning's glass technology group, told Reuters - and glass has its limits. 'You can bend it, but you can't keep flexing it,' said Adrian Burden, a UK consultant who has worked on several start-ups related to display technology, and holds patents in the field. This means that while glass is likely to continue to play a leading role in devices with curved displays, screens that users can bend, fold and roll will likely be plastic. But plastic is not as robust as glass. 'As soon as you introduce plastic substrates you have all kinds of issues with sensitivity to the environment,' says Burden. So while OLED and plastic would seem to be companion technologies they create an extra problem when laid together: they need so-called barrier films to prevent the various layers from leaking oxygen and moisture. A Samsung concept shows off a tablet-sized screen that can be rolled up . Even after the success of Gorilla Glass, popularized by the iPhone, Corning is having to work hard to prepare customers for Willow displays. Clappin said customers want thinner devices and easier to produce glass, but Willow requires a completely different manufacturing set-up. 'When we talk about commercializing Willow a big part of our development activity is enabling the ecosystem to handle what is essentially a brand new material,' Clappin added. 'Nobody's accustomed to working with glass that bends and moves. It's a new material. The ecosystem needs to be trained to handle it.' He sees demand, particularly from video gamers, for Willow-based curved screens, but remains less convinced about rollable or foldable screens. 'Conformable is in the near future. 'As far as flexible, bendable, fold-upable goes, I see that further out and I'm not even sure that's a viable product,' he said. Samsung's 'skin' a concept for a bendable mobile . For companies with deep pockets, like Samsung, this can mean building prototypes such as those displayed at international technology shows. But that doesn't guarantee success in selling products. Sony, for example, promoted flexible OLED displays back in 2007. 'Six years later they've not come up with anything,' says Zhang Jie, senior scientist at Singapore's Institute of Metals Research and Engineering. 'If Samsung's going to really drive this the application really needs to drive people and make them want it.' This slows down the process. In late 2011, Samsung told analysts it planned to introduce flexible displays into handsets 'some time in 2012, hopefully the earlier part than later, . 'but a year later the company said the technology was still ""under development."" In an investment note last month Jefferies said that while Samsung may introduce ""unbreakable"" screens this year, it didn't expect to see flexible displays in Samsung devices until 2014-15. Ultimately, teasing out the technical problems may be only half the battle. 'This is the eternal question of the speciality materials industry,' says Lutz Grubel, Japan-based head of marketing for German glass maker Schott's Xensation Cover 3-D glass. 'You have something, a material, and you're looking for an application. That's the game.'","Samsung and Apple both believed to be experimenting with 'flexible glass'

The 17th century tome called the Eikon Basilike - The Royal Portrait - . was published 10 days after the monarch's execution on January 30, 1649, . and was once owned by the Queen's grandmother Queen Mary. Charles' death came after he was tried for treason and convicted, and it . followed the defeat of his forces in the Civil War and his capture. The 17th century book, probably written in part by Charles, contains . accounts of various events and hardships the King encountered in the . years before his defeat. Piece of history: King Charles I's ribbon was discovered attached to a book that was published 10 days after his execution on January 30, 1649 . It features an inscription that claims the pieces of cloth are from the . garter worn by the sovereign but this was treated with caution by . curators as the wording appears to date from the 18th century. The garter ribbon and the portrait will be reunited in the trust's new . exhibition In Fine Style: The Art of Tudor and Stuart Fashion, which . explores the fashionable attire of European royal courts in the 16th and . 17th centuries. In the van Dyck portrait, the King is wearing a lace collar or 'cloak . band', decorated with a soft scallop design popular during the mid-17th . century. A rare surviving lace collar, thought to have been worn by Charles I and . dating from around the same year as the painting, completed in 1636, . has been lent to the exhibition by the Bowes Museum. Anna Reynolds, the trust's curator of the exhibition, said: ""The . exhibition presented us with a unique opportunity to bring the painting . back to life through some of the fashionable items the artist recorded . the King wearing and to compare the three-dimensional objects with the . two-dimensional image. ""It's incredible to think that these lengths of silk could in fact be . the garter ribbon in one of the most enduring images of the King.""

Russia will ban smoking in many public places under President Vladimir Putin’s plans to make citizens healthier, live longer and help the economy. In the nation with one of the world's highest smoking rates, the law, signed by Putin on Saturday and passed by parliament last week, will mean smoking will gradually be banned at work, in the subway, restaurants, cafes, ships and long-distance trains from June. The legislation will also restrict cigarette sales and ban advertising and sponsorship of events by tobacco companies. Public health plans: Russia will ban smoking in many public places under President Vladimir Putin's plans to make citizens healthier, live longer and help the economy . It was opposed by foreign firms such . as British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco, and Philip . Morris, which control more than 90 per cent of a Russian cigarette . market which is worth about £13.2 billion annually. Putin's . aim is to force millions of Russians to make a lifestyle change in a . country where bars and restaurants are often filled with a thick haze of . smoke.  Some 40 per cent of Russians smoke regularly, according to the . World Bank. In a sign that many will resist, smokers . rights' groups oppose the law and a website has sprung up which, in a . nod to Russia's Communist past, declares: ‘Smokers of the world unite.’ Force a lifestyle change: It is hoped that the new legislation will force millions of Russians to make a lifestyle change in a country where bars and restaurants are often filled with a thick haze of smoke . Grigory, a 60-year-old businessman in Moscow who declined to give his second name, said: ‘I'm categorically against this stupid ban. Smoking is heavily restricted now anyway. No smoking in offices, no smoking in staircases, nowhere. ‘I'll go out even less now as there's nowhere to go for us chain-smokers.’ The law will be phased in, with smoking banned in some public places, such as subways and schools from June 1. It will then be broadened to include restaurants and cafes a year later. Sales of tobacco products will be forbidden at street kiosks from June 1, 2014, advertising and displaying cigarettes will be restricted, and minimum prices will be set for cigarettes which mostly cost 50 to 60 rubles for a pack of 20 (less than £1.30). Owners of the ubiquitous kiosks, which . many convenience shoppers rely on, say many could go out of business, . especially as they have already been hit by restriction on alcohol . sales. The law is part of Putin's drive to . reverse a population decline that began after the Soviet Union collapsed . in 1991. He hopes it will increase productivity and promote economic . growth. Putin stepped up . these efforts since his return to the presidency in May, mounting a . campaign reminiscent of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt to . crack down on drinking under his failed ‘perestroika’ reforms of the . late 1980s. Big business: A man smokes in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia as foreign firms oppose the ban including British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco which control more than 90 per cent of a Russian cigarette market worth about £13.2 billion annually . Gradual ban: The law will be phased in, with smoking banned in some public places, such as subways and schools from June 1. It will then be broadened to include restaurants and cafes a year later . Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said last year almost 400,000 Russians die each year from smoking-related causes. World Bank figures show Russia's population slumped to 141.9 million in 2011 from 148.6 million in 1991, with average life expectancy at 69 years, against 78 in the United States. Failure to expand the workforce would limit economic growth. Announcing Putin had signed the law, . the Kremlin said on Monday it would bring Russia into line with a World . Health Organization tobacco control treaty which it ratified in 2008. The . All-Russian Smokers' Rights Movement said the law would not work and . called instead for moves to discourage youngsters from starting smoking. Smoking population: Some 40 per cent of Russians smoke regularly (pictured left is a student in St Petersburg, and right a coal mine worker in Shestaki, Siberia). Almost 400,000 people die each year from smoking-related causes, according to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev . Erik Bloomquist, an analyst at . Berenberg Bank, said: ‘In aggregate... we do not expect the restrictions . to make much difference in overall consumption or prevalence, and think . the smoking bans will be honoured more in the breach than in . actuality.’ He said increases planned in excise taxes were likely to have a bigger impact on consumption. The move is a blow to Japan Tobacco, in which the Japanese government plans to sell about a third of its stake. Like other tobacco companies, it said it would abide by the law but several firms said the law could increase illicit trade. Alexander Lioutyi, Corporate Affairs Director, BAT Russia said: ‘Implementation of sales restrictions accompanied by the extensive year-on-year growth of excise in Russia may lead to a massive inflow of cheaper products from neighbouring states.’ Should ban more: Russia's Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said tough laws similar to the smoking ban should be used to crack down on over-eating and 'excessive' sex . Last week Russia's Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said tough laws similar to the smoking ban should be used to crack down on over-eating and 'excessive' sex. The senior Russian political leader said the smoking laws do not go far enough - and should tackle obesity and sex too. Mr Zhirinovsky told local radio: 'We need eating restrictions. Our people are overfed and too fat.' He said Russian people die earlier than the rest of the world because they eat and smoke excessively and have too much sex. Under his plans, people would be issued with a voucher giving them permission to make love just once every three months. 'Sex should be restricted to one time per quarter through issuing licenses, quotas or coupons,' he explained.","The legislation will also restrict cigarette sales and ban advertising of events by tobacco companies .

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 02:55 EST, 2 September 2011 . Almost 150 Gurkhas were kicked out of the Army today, under the first wave of sweeping cuts to the UK's military. A total of 920 soldiers and another 930 RAF personnel were told they were being made redundant - 750 of them against their will. The Ministry of Defence has not confirmed which units were affected - but it is understood no RAF ground crews based in Italy and supporting operations in Libya were included. Under threat: A total of 150 Gurkhas, such as these from the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, are to be made redundant as part of the Government cuts . Staff were being informed primarily by their commanding officers at various barracks and in some cases by telephone. The Army is making around 260 compulsory redundancies as part of the Coalition's efforts to tackle the deficit and bring the defence budget under control. The MoD expects some Gurkhas facing the axe to transfer to other infantry regiments which are currently below full strength. A total of 869 soldiers applied for redundancy but only 660 of them are being allowed to leave. In a message sent to all personnel, Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards said: 'While for some redundancy may be seen as an opportunity, for others it will understandably represent a significant challenge for both the individual and their families. 'I am aware that this continues to be an unsettling time and that this only represents the first tranche of redundancy. 'Throughout this period we need to remain focused on operations and maintaining the quality that makes our Armed Forces, person for person, the finest in the world.' The head of Army manning, Brigadier Richard Nugee, said in April that the cuts to the 3,500-strong Brigade of Gurkhas were necessary following recent changes to the Gurkhas' terms of service that placed them on the same footing as the rest of the Army. Some 622 British airmen and women sought voluntary redundancy, of whom 440 had their applications granted. The RAF is also making about 490 compulsory redundancies. Spared: It is understood that RAF ground crews based in Italy and supporting operations in Libya will not be included in the redundancies . The plans to cut the posts were announced earlier this year as part of a programme which could see 11,000 redundancies across the RAF, Army and Royal Navy by April 2015. Personnel receiving the operational allowance, paid to those serving on the front line in Libya and Afghanistan, will be exempt from redundancy. Sad news: Defence Secretary Liam Fox blamed the cuts on the previous Labour government for leaving the country's finances broken . Troops who are about to deploy to Afghanistan or who have recently returned from duty there were also protected from losing their jobs. Members of the armed forces accepted for voluntary redundancy will serve six months' notice, while those forced out will serve a year. Defence Secretary Liam Fox said: 'The responsibility for these redundancies lies with the incompetence of the last Labour government who left the nation's finances broken and a £38 billion black hole in the defence budget. 'The tough measures we have taken will bring the budget largely into balance for the first time in a generation. 'The extra money we have allocated for the equipment budget from 2015 will allow our defence capability to grow in the second half of the decade. 'Of course redundancies are always sad news, but we will continue to have strong and capable forces and we appreciate the hard work of our brave armed forces.' Sacking hundreds of Army and RAF personnel will have 'long-term consequences' for the UK, Labour has warned. Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy told BBC Breakfast that while savings were necessary, 'they are probably going too quickly, too deeply in cutting the deficit'. He added: 'A bigger worry is that while we all know that the deficit is temporary, the cuts at this stage are permanent. 'Once you sack an RAF trainee pilot they aren't coming back, they're gone for good. So, this has got very long-term consequences for our country.'","Total of 920 soldiers and 930 RAF staff lose their jobs .

'Nasty temper': Mark Lackenby, seen outside Sheffield Crown Court earlier in the trial, was today found guilty of manslaughter and jailed for 10 years . An enraged father who violently shook and killed his newborn baby daughter after losing a bet on a football match has been jailed for 10 years. Mark Lackenby, 32, was watching Arsenal's Champions League clash with Barcelona on TV with five-week-old Ruby last year, when he snapped after Barcelona's David Villa scored the first goal of the match. Furious Lackenby - who had backed Arsenal's Robin van Persie to score first - shook his baby daughter causing 'catastrophic' brain injuries. She died the following day, a trial at Sheffield Crown Court heard. Lackenby was today cleared of murdering his daughter at their home in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire, but was found guilty of her manslaughter by a jury. He was also found guilty of causing Ruby grievous bodily harm when he broke her ribs a week or so before he inflicted the fatal injuries. Lackenby, now of Bolton-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire, was in tears as the judge described what had happened when he was left alone with his daughter as he watched the match while her mother Gemma Coates was upstairs having a bath. He had denied hurting Ruby. The court was told Lackenby bet £2.50 at odds of 70-1 on Robin van Persie to score the first goal for Arsenal and Arsenal to win the match 2-1. He stood to win £200 but when Villa scored Ruby cried and Lackenby lost his temper. Sentencing Lackenby, the judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, told him: 'It's frankly despicable and defies belief that anyone could do such a thing to their own baby in such circumstances.' The judge said to Lackenby: 'That evening you badly lost your temper with this tiny baby and the football simultaneously. 'You settled down to watch this football match. At 8.11pm that evening David Villa, a Barcelona player, scored the first goal. 'At around that time Ruby was heard to cry. 'It's abundantly clear that at that moment you shook her violently causing catastrophic brain and nerve injuries which led her to collapse very quickly. 'Anguish': Baby Ruby died in hospital the following day, Sheffield Crown Court heard . 'Despite the best efforts of the paramedics who were on the scene very, very quickly and the marvellous care and attention by the various doctors who attended to Ruby at Barnsley and then Sheffield Children's Hospital, sadly Ruby's life support machine had to be switched off 24 hours later.' The judge said that despite witnesses . saying Lackenby - who has three other children from a previous . relationship - was a loving and caring father, there was evidence he had . harmed baby Ruby on other occasions. He . said the tragic incident 'was the result of a nasty outbreak of temper . on your part and that it was a growing pattern of abusive behaviour by . you towards your daughter, Ruby'. The judge told him: 'It's a mystery to some extent as to what did or could have caused you to be so cruel to Ruby. 'Was it one child too many? 'Was it too many responsibilities? 'Was it the break-up of one relationship and the beginning of another? 'Whatever the reason, cruel you were to Ruby on several occasions.' Mr Justice Haddon-Cave . And he told Lackenby he had to 'bear the guilt and the loss of your own child at your own hand'. Lackenby wiped tears away a number of times during the judge's remarks. After he stood and was sentenced to 10 years in prison he shook his head slightly but then thanked the judge as he was led away. Coates, 31, a former nursery worker, of . the same address, was cleared by the jury of attempting to pervert the . course of justice by giving a false account to medical staff as to how . Ruby came about her injuries. She left the dock in tears. The court was told that Lackenby bet £2.50 at odds of 70-1 on Robin van Persie to score the first goal for Arsenal and Arsenal to win the match 2-1. He stood to win £200 until David Villa scored for Barcelona . He stood to win £200 but when Villa scored Ruby cried and Lackenby lost his temper . Lackenby was found guilty after a three-week long trial. After today's verdicts, Crown Prosecution Service lawyer Sue Steeples said: 'Mark Lackenby had his night planned. 'He came home to his tea on the table, beers in the fridge and a football match on the television. He'd bet on the football and stood to win if the match went his way. 'Ruby, his five week old daughter, was next to him on the sofa whilst her mother Gemma went in the bath. 'When a goal was scored against Mark's team, we believe he lost his temper and lashed out at Ruby. 'We don't know specifically what happened to Ruby but we do know that it resulted in a brain injury which led to her death. 'Mark had an opportunity to help her. When paramedics arrived they needed a true account of what happened to Ruby so they could offer her the best possible treatment. 'Mark lied to the paramedics and claimed Ruby had just stopped breathing. 'We can only hope that today's outcome offers some comfort to those who loved her,' said Ms Steeples. Detective chief inspector Sean Middleton, the senior investigating officer from South Yorkshire Police, said: 'This is a tragic case which must have caused a great deal of anguish for the extended family of Ruby and has greatly affected the community of Goldthorpe. 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Goldthorpe community for helping us.'

Nasa’s most advanced mobile robotic laboratory, which will examine one of the most intriguing areas on Mars, is in final preparations for a launch from Florida's Space Coast on November 25. The Mars Science Laboratory mission will carry Curiosity, a rover with more scientific capability than any ever sent to another planet. It will set down inside a huge crater and use its highly advanced instruments, including cameras and lasers, to find out more about the planet’s environment, which will help pave the way for human missions. Red alert: Curiosity will probe the Martian environment using highly advanced instruments . Size matters: The Mars Science Laboratory is the biggest and most sophisticated planet-roaming machine ever to be deployed . Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at Nasa Headquarters in Washington, said: ‘Mars Science Laboratory builds upon the improved understanding about Mars gained from current and recent missions. ‘This mission advances technologies and science that will move us toward missions to return samples from, and eventually send humans to, Mars.’ Scheduled to land on the Red Planet in August 2012, the one-ton rover will examine Gale Crater during a mission that will last nearly two years. Curiosity will land near the base of a layered mountain three miles (five kilometres) high inside the crater. About to have a blast: The Mars Science Laboratory is transported to the launch pad . The rover will investigate whether environmental conditions ever have been favourable for development of microbial life and preserved evidence of those conditions. John Grotzinger, project scientist for the Mars Science Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said: ‘Gale gives us a superb opportunity to test multiple potentially habitable environments and the context to understand a very long record of early environmental evolution of the planet. ‘The portion of the crater where Curiosity will land has an alluvial fan likely formed by water-carried sediments. Layers at the base of the mountain contain clays and sulphates, both known to form in water.’ Curiosity is twice as long and five times as heavy as earlier Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. The rover will carry a set of 10 science instruments weighing 15 times as much as its predecessors' science payloads. A mast extending to seven feet (2.1 metres) above ground provides height for cameras and a laser-firing instrument to study targets from a distance. Instruments on a seven-foot-long (2.1-metre-long) arm will study targets up close. Analytical instruments inside the rover will determine the composition of rock and soil samples acquired with the arm's powdering drill and scoop. Other instruments will characterise the environment, including the weather and natural radiation that will affect future human missions. The rover is now sitting on top of an Atlas V rocket awaiting lift-off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. ‘Preparations are on track for launching at our first opportunity,’ said Pete Theisinger, Mars Science Laboratory project manager at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ‘If weather or other factors prevent launching then, we have more opportunities through to December 18.’ Ready for blast off: The Mars Science Laboratory is hoisted on top of the Atlas V rocket, left, and is now in place, right .","The robotic lab is due to land on Mars in August 2012 .

A sex-obsessed police officer who used his job to chase, seduce and sexually assault women was behind bars last night. Twice-married constable Matthew Daniel Fisher, 37, had sex in a police van with a woman he met at a supermarket. They had an affair after he used the force computer to look up her details. He had a sex romp with another 26-year-old woman while on duty after initially chatting her up and offering her a lift home in his police van as she enjoyed a night out on New Year’s Day. Fisher seduced her by lying about not being married. The police officer patrolled the streets looking for a target to pursue and wouldn’t take no for an answer. And he forced himself upon vulnerable women who he came across during his duties because they were victims of crime. Fisher was found guilty of three sex assault offences on two women and convicted of misconduct in public office for using a police database to get mobile phone numbers of women he fancied. One received 52 calls and didn’t return any. Following the verdicts at Hull Crown Court he was remanded in custody and was told by the judge he would be jailed at a hearing next month. Fisher, who has two children aged 13 and eight, had previously admitted two further misconduct in public office offences for having sex romps whilst on duty with two women. However, he was cleared of attempting to rape a 20-year-old who had called police because she had been assaulted by her partner. Fisher arrived at the house to take her statement and the woman said ‘he kept asking me if I had knickers on.’ The PC allegedly grabbed her and said ‘all you young girls like it’ and pinned her to the bed and attempted to rape her. But Fisher denied assaulting the woman, who told him she wanted to be a glamour model, and insisted she performed a sex act on him. Caught: Matthew Daniel Fisher had sex in a police van with a woman he met outside Selby bus garage . The judge said he would have faced a jail term of ‘five to six years’ if he had been convicted of the attempted rape. Some women did fall for his unsubtle approach. In one case he wrote his telephone number on the back of a girl’s car in the snow - described as the cheesiest approach she had ever seen. While Stephanie Yates, 24, first met Fisher when shopping in Morrison’s supermarket in Selby. He saw her at 3am the next day as she walked home with a friend and he later sent her a text. Asked how he got her number, Fisher texted: ‘I took the liberty of looking you up.’ His first victim was a 22-year-old drug addict and alcoholic. Fisher went to a flat to ask her and several friends to turn make less noise. Fisher agreed to give the drunk woman a lift home and flirted with her in the car. He then grabbed her hand and put it on his trousers, with the comment: ‘What do you think of the size of that? It’s big innit?’ She pulled away and got out. Fisher also visited the house of a mother who needed police help after her son was involved in an incident. He visited her home repeatedly and often made sexual comments to her. She claimed he pulled at her top and looked at her breasts. Fisher also allegedly exposed himself to her and assaulted her in the kitchen as she put on make-up. Police began inquiries in March 2011 when the partner of one victim went to police. After the case temporary North Yorkshire Police Chief Constable Tim Madgwick praised the victims for having the courage to come forward and said Fisher - who was known by his middle name - would be sacked. He said: ‘Daniel Fisher has brought disgrace on the office of Constable. He abused his position of authority for the sake of his own gratification. This behaviour is completely unacceptable.’","Matthew Daniel Fisher had sex in a police van with one women .

A long-awaited report into bullying and harassment at the BBC, which was commissioned in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, has revealed there were 37 formal complaints of sexual harassment over the past six years. No disciplinary measures were taken and in some cases perpetrators were promoted even after complaints had been upheld against them. The review found there was a perception within the organisation that BBC stars did not have to adhere to the same rules as normal staff because they could ‘wield power’. Barrister Dinah Rose (left) compiled the report which director general of the BBC Tony Hall (right) said made for 'uncomfortable reading' It also said some on-air talent’s behaviour was ‘often inappropriate’ and in certain cases should be categorised as ‘renowned’. Barrister Dinah Rose’s findings are particularly embarrassing for the corporation which came out on the same day its former presenter Stuart Hall pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 13 girls aged as young as nine. While the 80-page Respect At Work linked the ‘untouchable’ treatment of stars directly to bullying and inappropriate behaviour, rather than sexual harassment, it none the less added to the impression of a celebrity obsessed culture at the broadcaster. Yesterday director general Tony Hall admitted the report made ‘uncomfortable reading’ and said there would now be ‘zero-tolerance’ of bullying and harassment. As part of the report being published the corporation also revealed that it will now drop gagging orders from all BBC contracts in the future. Guilty: Stuart Hall arrives at Preston Crown Court today, with solicitor Maurice Watkins, where he has admitted historic sex allegations . There has been deep concern in the past that the BBC has been able prevent people speaking out about their treatment at the corporation as a result of these clauses in their contracts. While the report said sexual harassment was much less common than bullying, it did admit there was evidence that some individuals working at the BBC had made ‘unwanted and inappropriate sexual advances’ to their colleagues or staff. In some cases people had been given warnings about their behaviour but then gone on to repeat their harassment of the person. Between April 2005 and December 2012 there had also been six employment tribunal claims which included allegations of sexual harassment. The long-awaited report into bullying and harassment at the BBC which was commissioned in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal . The report added that in sexual harassment cases there was a tendency for the victim to be ‘young and in the early stages of their career’ and ‘almost exclusively female’ while the perpetrators tended to be men and in ‘positions of influence’. Victims had complained that they had ‘nowhere safe and confidential to go’ to report the problem and to ‘see it acted upon’. Miss Rose’s research found concerns about bullying and other forms of inappropriate behaviour were ‘much more prominent’ than sexual harassment. In this types of cases it was said that some bosses and stars were seen as ‘untouchable’ because of their ‘perceived value to the BBC’. The report once again created the impression of an organisation that was submissive to the talent it often pays large amounts of money to. It said: ‘There is a perception that “talent” are treated differently and don’t have to adhere to the same rules because they wield power over the organisation and anyone who tries to manage them. ‘In many cases, the BBC does not directly employ them and so people are quite unsure about what interventions are possible.’ The review said it had heard of examples of talent whose behaviour was ‘often inappropriate’ and their actions were what it would class as ‘visible’ and in some cases ‘renowned’. People who gave evidence to the review were said to have been ‘fearful of raising complaints’ about bullying and harassment, because they feared it would impact on their career. The report, which spoke of ‘known bullies’ at the corporation, noted: ‘Throughout our conversations we heard a strong undercurrent of fear; fear of speaking out, fear of reprisal, fear of losing your job, being made redundant, fear of becoming a victim, fear of getting a reputation as a troublemaker and not getting promoted if an employee, or further work if a freelancer, supplier or contractor.’ One contributor told the review: ‘People are afraid to complain, there is a huge fear of reputational loss and shame. These are the invisible silencing mechanisms.’ Of the 37 cases of sexual harassment only 25 resulted in a formal disciplinary process. The report said the BBC had not been clear enough about the standard of behaviour that was expected from all staff including on-air ‘talent’. The BBC will now launch a range of new measures to tackle the problem including a confidential helpline for support with bullying and harassment and making it explicitly clear to employees that must not behave in this way. The report, which did not name any individuals, heard from 930 people ranging from presenters, senior bosses through to technicians and engineers. The BBC’s management admitted some managers at the BBC were ‘concerned’ they would become part of a ‘witch-hunt’ by disgruntled staff as part of the process. While the corporation announced an end to gagging clauses it did admit it would continue to use confidentiality agreements where appropriate. Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, welcomed action to tackle bullying, and said: ‘It is quite clear that bullying has become an institutionalised problem at the BBC, one that has taken hold over many years.’ BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said: ‘Sexual harassment and bullying have no place at the BBC and should be acted on and stamped out.’","Report was commissioned in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal .

Once the preserve of WAGs and reality TV stars, the ‘Scouse brow’ spread like wildfire after the Duchess of Cambridge modelled the darker, bushier style... and fashion-conscious women everywhere put down their tweezers. But for many, leaving things to nature didn’t offer a quick enough fix. After years of over-plucking, women are  now going to desperate lengths to bring back their eyebrows. Plastic surgeons report a surge in the numbers requesting transplants to thicken out their sparse, pencilled-in brows. The British Association of Plastic Surgeons said transplanting hairs from the head to the eyebrows is increasingly popular. The procedure, which costs around £3,000 per side and can take four hours, involves implanting up to 200 individual hair follicles under local anaesthetic. Dr Raghu Reddy, a hair restoration expert, said: ‘We have witnessed interest grow since around the time of the Royal Wedding. Now we have a healthy stream of women who come in. There is also greater awareness now. ‘While I do have patients who have over-plucked, I also have women who come in with perfectly normal eyebrows who are looking for a thicker, fuller brow to rival the likes of Kate Middleton.’ The ‘Scouse brow’ trend was sparked by the stars of E4’s Liverpool-based reality TV show, Desperate Scousewives, as well as Merseyside WAGs Alex Curran and Coleen Rooney. Celebrities who have opted for a fuller look include model Cara Delevingne and actresses Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley. Claire Culverwell, 30, spent £3,500 to change her brows after plucking for 14 years. The dental technician, from Manchester, said: ‘It was fashionable when I was a teenager. I wanted to look like the celebrities. Keira Knightley has been pictured sporting a thicker, fuller brow, inspiring women to turn to plastic surgery to achieve the look . 'I carried on doing it over many years with tweezers and ended up permanently damaging my brows. ‘A hair follicle only has a finite number of cycles of growth and if you pluck it too many times, you end up killing it off. ‘I realised I had brought this on myself and I was a little embarrassed to seek treatment.’ Miss Culverwell had an inch-long strip of hair taken from the back of her head. Each of the 400 to 500 hairs was separated under a microscope and individually transplanted into small holes in the eyebrows using a fine needle. ‘It boosted my confidence,’ she said. ‘It was worth every penny.’ Royal approval: Even the Duchess of Cambridge has adopted the new look .","Plastic surgeons say women turning to them for luxuriant brows .

A man died and his wife is seriously ill after they were apparently poisoned by carbon monoxide fumes from a barbecue while on a camping holiday. Chris and Jane Bainbridge, who were staying in a £35-per-night wooden pod in the Lake District, were overcome by fumes as they slept. Camping pods are timber-built huts which provide more comfortable accommodation than a tent. Weekend away: Chris and Jane Bainbridge were staying in a wooden camping pod like this one when they were overcome by fumes (file photo) As they provide better shelter from the elements they are particularly popular in the winter months. Mr and Mrs Bainbridge are believed to have moved a barbecue inside their pod on Saturday evening, the Daily Mirror reported. Their neighbours . back home raised the alarm in Darlington, County Durham, when they . failed to return from their weekend away. Dubbed the silent killer, carbon monoxide poisonings claim the lives of 25 people in Britain every year. As it is colourless and odourless, people with faulty gas appliances often fall unconscious without realising anything is wrong. Wealthy British businessman Philip Townsend, 55, and his wife MaryAnne, 52, are both believed to have fallen victim to carbon monoxide while on holiday in Estonia last month. The couple died in a converted barn which it is believed they bought last year. Millionaire's daughter Zoe Anderson, 24, (pictured) died from carbon monoxide poisoning after a gas fitter 'botched' a boiler installation in Bath, Somerset. Andrew Hartley, 37, was convicted of manslaughter earlier this month after failing to properly secure the flue pipe to a new boiler in December 2010. Last year, Tracy Screen, 35, died after being overcome by carbon monoxide fumes while camping. It is thought the fumes from a barbecue outside her tent in Gyrn Goch, Caernarfon, drifted in. A search was launched and they were discovered slumped inside the pod at the Quiet Site Caravan Park in Ullswater, Cumbria, on Monday afternoon. Paramedics were called but Mr Bainbridge, 45, was already dead while Mrs Bainbridge, 43, was unconscious. Mr Bainbridge was a management information officer at Darlington Borough Council. Today Mrs Bainbridge remains in hospital where she is in a serious condition. It . is unclear exactly what happened to Mr and Mrs Bainbridge but  the .

A . spokeswoman for the North West Ambulance Service said: 'We were called . on Monday at 16.25 to the Quiet Site Caravan Park in Watemillock after . reports of a male deceased and a female unconscious. 'We took the female to Cumberland Infirmary.' Neighbour Pam Stott said the couple from Darlington, County Durham, were 'happy and smiling' when she waved them off on Friday. Mrs Stott said they were regular campers who usually stayed in a tent. She added: 'You couldn’t ask for better friends and neighbours - we’re so shocked and can’t believe what’s happened.' Gordon Peacock, a friend of the couple, said: 'We’re not really sure what happened. It seems to be just a tragic accident.' Mr Bainbridge's colleagues at Darlington Borough Council, where he had worked for 27 years, were yesterday told of the tragedy. Murray Rose, director of people, told . staff: 'Chris was holidaying with his wife in the Lake District at the . time of his death; his wife is also seriously ill in hospital.

Baby boy:  Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein, 61, has revealed tht he named his first son Dashiell after author Dashiell Hammett, because it reminds him of his first date with his designer wife, Georgina . Chapman . 'I said, ""Georgina, meet [the novel's author] Dashiell Hammett,"" and she read The Thin Man.' Dashiell, who was born on April 11, is his father's fifth child but first son. He is brother to 37-year-old Ms Chapman's daughter India Pearl, two, as well as Emma, 18, Lily, 16, and Ruth, 11, Mr Weinstein's daughters from a previous marriage. The Miramax co-founder admits he is delighted to finally have a son, mostly because he is 'so tired of going to Forever 21 and Abercrombie . . . 'On Sundays I wake up and I go, ""The game’s on!"" and [my daughters go], ""At the mall, you’re driving us to the mall.""' Not that they want his style advice, he adds.

Mr Weinstein met British-born Marchesa co-founder Ms Chapman in 2004  - the couple wed in Connecticut three years later. When Mr Weinstein announced that his wife was expecting again in December, he said: 'We don’t know the sex. It could be Harvey and five daughters. I’d be happy either way.' Ms Chapman, who spent months expertly hiding her baby . bump under loose-fitting red carpet dresses, told Celebrity Baby Scoop that her pregnancy had been 'perfect' and 'easy.' The former model, who established Marchesa in 2004 with Keren Craig, also discussed juggling children with a high-profile, and demanding business.

He had pledged to treat the court with ‘respect.’ But BBC comedian Simon Brodkin was accused of doing exactly the opposite and making a mockery of the British justice system yesterday after his joking around landed him before a judge. The former public schoolboy, who abandoned a medical career in favour of comedy six years ago, was hauled to court after a publicity stunt backfired last month. Scroll down to watch the statement . Poking fun: Simon Brodkin leaving court in Liverpool with a glamorous Wag-style 'girlfriend' called Crystal . Dressed as footballer Jason Bent – a character from his BBC3 series in which he parodies the lives of pampered players – Brodkin managed to get on to the pitch and mingle with the Manchester City team shortly before their away game with Everton at Goodison Park. To the bemusement of several professional players, including England’s Joe Hart and Gareth Barry, he jogged along the touchline and performed stretches, before being led away by police and arrested. Earlier this week Brodkin, 35, from North London, said he would never have done the stunt – filmed to promote his new series – had he realised he would end up in court and pledged: ‘I have got to treat the court with the respect it deserves.’ But by the time he left court with a caution yesterday – and a warning from the judge to ‘reflect on the stupidity of his actions’ – he was back in character and joking about the case. Brodkin appeared contrite in the dock yesterday at Liverpool Community Justice Centre, charged with going onto the playing area contrary to the Football Offences Act on March 16. Having a laugh: Simon Brodkin left North Liverpool Community Justice Centre as his Jason Bent character . Quip: Brodkin's alter ego thanked his glamorous WAG called Crystal for standing by him 'since last night' His solicitor Raymond Shaw told the court: ‘It was intended to be a humorous act. It is clear from the television footage that some of the players were amused but he didn’t know it was a criminal offence. ‘He expressed his remorse immediately when he was spoken to by the club and the police. He’s sorry and regrets his actions.’ District judge Ian Lomax agreed to the charge being withdrawn after hearing an ‘alternative course of action to prosecution’ had been found. Brodkin was given a conditional caution. The BBC said he was not filming for the broadcaster on the day of the stunt. The judge told him to ‘regard himself somewhat fortunate’ and ‘reflect on the stupidity of his actions’. Prank: Brodkin sneaked onto the pitch at Goodison Park last month in a stunt for his BBC3 show. He warmed up alongside the likes of (left-right) Edin Dzeko, Carlos Tevez and James Milner ahead of the match .

Despite the  warning, Brodkin then got into character outside the court and delivered a statement as his footballer alter-ego. He spiked up his highlighted hair into a shark-fin style, inserted two diamond studs into his ears and was joined by a blonde Wag-style ‘girlfriend’. He thanked his supporters before reading a series of jokes in a Liverpool accent and unbuttoning his shirt to reveal a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ‘Why always Bent?’ – a reference to a similar stunt performed by Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli last season. ‘Thanks also to the judge, who was sat on the bench but unfortunately didn’t get a game,’ the comedian said. Asked if he was mocking the justice system, Brodkin, who was also banned from attending football matches until the end of the season, refused to comment. Brodkin, a qualified doctor, relinquished his GMC registration in 2007 when his comedy career began to take off.","Simon Brodkin, 35, of London, given a conditional caution in Liverpool .

Robbins, 44, has been captured after a clerical error mistakenly released him from a Chicago courtroom last week . A convicted murder mistakenly released in Chicago because of ‘clerical error’ has been recaptured after spending a week on the run. Steven L. Robbins, 44, was rearrested on late Friday night in Kankakee, about 60 miles south of Chicago, the Cook County Sheriff's Department said after mistakenly given civilian clothes and sent on his way. Illinois officials acknowledged he was able to escape because they lost paperwork directing them to return him to Indiana after his court appearance. Although the details of his capture weren't immediately released though was said to have happened without incident, officials said they used various leads and interviews with friends and family members at police headquarters to locate him. Robbins was serving a 60-year sentence for murder in Indiana and was escorted by Cook County sheriff's deputies to Chicago this week for a court appearance in a separate case involving drug and armed violence charges - a case that had actually been dismissed in 2007. After appearing before two Cook County Circuit Court judges, Robbins was taken to a jail on Chicago's South Side. Captured: Robbins is seen apprehended in Kankakee, Illinois on Friday while wearing civilian clothes, possibly the same ones provided to him mistakenly by officers . He was released hours later, instead of being sent back to Indiana to continue his murder sentence. The public was not alerted that he was on the loose for about 24 hours. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart on Friday took responsibility for Robbins' release, saying a document showing he should be returned to Indiana disappeared while his deputies were transporting the prisoner, sometime between a Tuesday court appearance and his return to jail after a second court appearance Wednesday. Robbins was released on Wednesday evening. ‘We're not ducking the fact we dropped the ball. We made mistakes,’ Dart said. ‘The public deserves much more. We're going to find out what went wrong here.’ But Dart and Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, both prominent local Democrats, exchanged tense words about who should accept responsibility for having Robbins brought to Chicago from Indiana. Alvarez said her office had told Dart's office that it didn't need to bring Robbins from Indiana because the drug and armed violence case was closed. But Dart's office proceeded anyway, she said, because of confusion over the outcome of the case and because Robbins demanded to stand trial. Back home: Robbins is heading back to the Indiana Department of Corrections, pictured, after his capture roughly 60 miles south of Chicago on Friday . ‘The Cook County Sherriff's Police, despite the fact that the assistant state's attorney told them that they didn't have to bring him back, they thought it would be better if they did bring him back to get this all cleared up because the guy keeps writing letters demanding trial,’ Alvarez told reporters. But Dart said his office sought - and was granted - permission from the state attorney's office to bring Robbins to Chicago. The sheriff showed The Associated Press a copy of the extradition request from September signed by one of Alvarez's prosecutors. ‘We can't just go to any state in the country and say `You know what? We're going to take someone out of your prison and bring him here.' ... They're the ones that signed off on allowing us to go get this guy,’ Dart said. Dart also said that because of an antiquated computer system, his office thought an arrest warrant for Robbins in the case was still active, which is why it asked the state attorney's office for permission to extradite Robbins. Victim: Robbins was convicted of killing Rutland Melton in 2002 after witnesses say Melton intervened in an argument Robbins was having with a woman at a party . ‘It's our fault but we move 100,000 people a day and it's all done with paper,’ Dart said. Before Robbins was captured, federal and local law enforcement officers knocked on doors in Illinois and Indiana on Friday, including those of his friends and relatives, the sheriff's office said. The FBI and U.S. Marshals Service offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his apprehension. Robbins, a Gary, Ind., native, was serving a sentence for murder and weapons convictions out of Marion County in Indiana. Witnesses to the 2002 killing told police Robbins was arguing with his wife outside a birthday party in Indianapolis when a man intervened, telling Robbins he should not hit a woman, according to court documents. The witnesses said Robbins then retrieved a gun from a car and shot the man, Rutland Melton, in the chest before fleeing. He started serving his sentence in October 2004 and his earliest projected release date was more than 16 years from now, on June 29, 2029. It is not the first time a prisoner has been mistakenly freed from the Cook County Jail. In 2009, Jonathan Cooper, who was serving a 30-year manslaughter sentence in Mississippi, was brought to Chicago to face charges that he failed to register as a sex offender. Prosecutors dropped the charges because, as an inmate, he could not comply with the Sex Offender Registration Act. A clerk reportedly failed to include the Mississippi sentence information in Cooper's file, and jail staff released him. Cooper turned himself in several days later. In a more recent embarrassment for law enforcement officials in Chicago, two convicted bank robbers escaped from a high-rise federal lockup in December by climbing down the side of the building on a rope made of bed sheets and jumping into a cab. Authorities recaptured both men, one of whom remained on the run for about two weeks. Officials have yet to provide a public explanation of the jailbreak.","Steven L.

Amazing sunrise: The day began beautifully near St Mary's Lighthouse at Whitley Bay, North Tyneside . The figures, from a Freedom of Information Act request, also showed that arrests were made in 75 per cent of the incidents, which included bricks thrown from bridges. The 2012 statistics compared with a survey for 2011 which revealed 395 missile incidents following information from 10 forces. Last year’s figures included 212 incidents recorded by Leicestershire Police, 190 by Nottinghamshire Police and 119 by Thames Valley Police. Avon and Somerset Constabulary recorded just six incidents. Autoglass managing director Matthew Mycock said: ‘It is alarming to discover that the number of motorists attacked with bridge and roadside missiles is on the increase.’ Channel Tunnel high-speed train company Eurostar said it was set for its busiest weekend of the year, with more than 100,000 passengers expected to travel over the bank holiday weekend.

Water users are unlikely to face hosepipe bans this year, authorities said today. A year ago, rate payers in some pockets of the UK were in the puzzling situation of having to endure water restrictions at a time of widespread heavy rainfall which contributed to 2012 being the second wettest year on record. Those who introduced the ban last year affected the usage habits of 20million people. But what may have seen like months of almost relentless rainfall have helped replenish stocks at reservoirs across the country, minimising the prospect of restrictions or droughts being declared this summer. Victoria Williams, drought advisor at the Environment Agency, said: ‘Our latest water situation report details a positive outlook for water resources in the coming months. ‘(Last year) was the second wettest year on record, and despite a relatively dry start to 2013, river levels are normal or above normal at the majority of our monitoring sites. ‘The results show a positive picture even if rainfall is below average and point to the risk of drought this summer being no greater than average. ‘However it is still as important as ever to use water wisely. If the weather does turn hot and dry there could be localised impacts on rivers and the environment.’ Seven water companies - Thames, Southern Water, South East Water, Anglian Water, Sutton and East Surrey, Veolia Central and Veolia South East - introduced hosepipe bans in the spring of 2012. It came after the unusually dry winters left some groundwater supplies and rivers as low as in the drought year of 1976. But the restrictions introduced early in April were followed by record rainfall across the UK for that month and June, with more rain between them in May. Most of the bans were lifted by early summer, while floods featured throughout November and December across some parts of the country.","South to see best of weekend weather - but there will be rain in Scotland .

The man in his 20s was found by other walkers on a 2,500 ft ridge on the mountain. The body was found close to a scrambling route known as Parson's Nose, that requires some rock climbing skills. The walker was pronounced dead yesterday at the scene by a medic in the Sea King helicopter search and rescue crew from nearby RAF Valley in Anglesey. Mount Snowdon, North Wales is the highest peak in England and Wales at 3560 ft above sea level . The crew, which counts Prince William amongst its rescue pilots, assisted the Llanberis and Aberglaslyn mountain rescue teams with the transfer of the body to hospital in Bangor. This is the second death on the mountain in the past month. An ice climber fell to his death on the mountain range over the Easter weekend. He fell more than 100ft down an icy mountain in Snowdonia in treacherous conditions. The same RAF crew was yesterday called to help the North East Wales search and rescue team after a paraglider was injured in a fall near Llantysilio, Denbighshire.

Charles 'Lucky' Lockett moaned in a letter to his wife about the lack of games facilities in Colditz, where he was imprisoned . A letter written by a captured RAF pilot has given a rare . insight into the notorious World War Two prisoner of war camp, Colditz Castle – . by one of its most audacious inmates. Air Commodore Charles ‘Lucky’ Lockett was incarcerated after . he was shot down over the Sedan, in France, in 1940, earning his nickname as the . only survivor of the attack. An extraordinary letter he sent to his wife in England after . spending three years in the camp is going under the hammer tomorrow. In the pencil written note, he moaned about the lack of . games facilities at Colditz, branding them ‘a disgrace’ but complimented a . doctor who lanced his boils with a ‘razor blade’. After his crash landing he was handed over to German soldiers . and despite a number of unsuccessful escape attempts - including making it on . board a Swedish ship – he was taken to the PoW camp, near Leipzig, known as . Oflag IV-C in 1940. During the war the castle was converted into a high security . prisoner-of-war camp for officers who had become security or escape risks or . who were regarded as particularly dangerous. But that didn’t stop lucky Mr Lockett. He is credited with having been on the team which built the . legendary ‘Colditz Cock’ - an incredible escape plan which involved launching a . home-made glider from the castle’s roof. The take-off was scheduled for spring 1945, but by then the . result of the war was becoming clear and the plan was ditched. The remarkable letter was written by WWII legend, Charles Edward Stuart 'Lucky' Lockett to his wife in England from Colditz Castle dated August 14 1943 . A view of Colditz Castle in the German state of Saxon, which acted as a high-security PoW camp during World War Two . Prisoners of war at Colditz Castle line up for inspection. The picture is taken from the book ""Colditz: The Definitive History"" by Henry Chancellor. Tomorrow the letter is expected to fetch over £500 when it . is auctioned by Mullock’s Auctioneers at Ludlow Racecourse in Shropshire. Dated August 14, 1943, it is written in pencil on a . pre-printed prisoner of war form - stamped with German and British censor . marks. Sent to his wife and signed ‘Charles’, the pilot says that . he has sent his wife some photographs. In the letter, ‘Lucky’ Lockett writes: ‘The footballers are . a mixed bunch. ‘I haven’t been down to the football field for a hell of a . time due to stoppages of privileges or some other reason. The letter gives a rare insight into life at the notorious PoW camp . ‘The lack of games playing facilities in what is to be an all . British camp is a disgrace. ‘The French men get parcels from France which supplement . their Red X parcels and take infinite trouble over their cooking. The result is . quite amazing. ‘A new Scotch doctor Capt Dickie has arrived and is messing . with us he is as far as first impressions go an excellent fellow. ‘I’ve seen quite a lot of him ‘cos I’ve had a couple of boils . ...he lanced one with a razor blade two days ago.’ A spokesperson from Mullock’s Auctioneers said: ‘Letters . from Colditz are becoming scarce and Lucky Lockett had a colourful war to say . the least. ‘It is expected to sell for between £300 and £500 but World . War Two items get a lot of interest we hope it could go even higher.’ The idea for the glider came from Lieutenant Tony Rolt. He realised the roof line, obscured from the German soldiers' view, would make a perfect launching point to fly over the River Maude, surrounding the castle. The workshop was set up in the attics of the building, behind a false wall, and the team of men were aided by a library book on aircraft design. It is thought the team would have broken through the end wall and launched the glider off a ramp mounted on the roof adjacent. Wood from bed slats, floor boards, spare electrical wire and prison sleeping bags were all used to construct the two-seater monoplane. The rake-off was scheduled for Spring 1945, but was put on held when the war began to come to a close. However, the team kept their plan on stand-by, fearing a massacre of prisoners. The glider was approaching completion when the American Army liberated the camp on 16 April 1945.

America's most hated mother Casey Anthony wants to escape Florida and move to Costa Rica as soon as her probation ends this summer, it has been claimed.

She is serving a year of probation after admitting she stole a friend's check book and wrote out five checks for $644.35 - but when it ends later this summer she hopes to escape to Central America. 'Casey is counting the days until her . probation ends,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'She has been researching countries that she could move . to and Costa Rica is at the top of the list.' She's back: Sporting short, blonde hair and glasses, Anthony is almost unrecognisable on the October YouTube diary she filmed. She is now hoping to escape to Costa Rica when her probation is complete . The country's warm weather and low cost of living appeals to the woman who has spent months in hiding in her South Florida home since the acquittal, the source added. 'She . wants to put as much distance as possible from Florida... and . she feels this is the best place to start a new life,' the source said. Sources have already claimed that Anthony is restless, as she has been going out regularly - yet she has put on so much weight she is not recognisable. After her dramatic acquittal, she has . spent months in hiding where she reportedly just sits indoors on the . computer while comfort eating - and so has piled on the pounds. But a source has revealed that this . new look - including a 'puffy face' - has apparently given her fresh . courage as she has been leaving her home regularly. 'Casey has been venturing out on a much more frequent basis recently because she is almost unrecognisable,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'She hasn't needed to wear a disguise because of the physical transformation.' Then: Casey Anthony looks thinner as she confers with attorneys Jose Baez and Dorothy Clay Simser during the murder trial last year. She has reportedly piled on the pounds while in hiding . The source added that she has turned . to comfort eating and pops out at night to rent films and collect food . from restaurants - but won't stay anywhere too long. 'Casey doesn't feel safe anywhere and just wants to leave the country and begin a new life,' the source added. It comes after a source told People magazine that Casey remains unemployed and has little money, while probation reports show she recently stopped attending counseling sessions. However, she has apparently started . speaking to her estranged mother Cindy in a bid to get their . relationship back on track, although she does not speak to her father. Anthony . is also said to be 'annoyed' about having to take the stand again at . the Orange County courthouse in January after her attorneys accepted a . defamation subpoena. She is being sued by Zenaida . Gonzalez, who shares the name of a fake babysitter Anthony initially told police had kidnapped her daughter. Anthony admitted . fabricating that story.

Florida after her probation ends in August but this new court order . means she will have to stay. The source said: 'She was really ready to move on with her life. This has ruined everything.' But despite being vilified by the public after going into hiding, Anthony has not entirely shied away from publicity. In October she appeared in a video . diary that she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes . for herself', although failed to mention Caylee. It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptized again in a bid to symbolise a new beginning.

Now Miss . Gonzalez is suing her after claiming she lost her job and apartment due . to the association with the disappearance of Caylee, whose body was . found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008. After initially sticking by the claim that the kidnapper had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool. It is this primary Inconsistency in her story that has sparked public outrage in the case and forced the defendant into hiding after her release. Her attorneys asked that she not be forced to appear in court, saying she has received death threats since being found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter. Hidden: Anthony has not been seen in public since her trial, and has spent most of the last 10 months inside . She was convicted of four counts of lying to police and is now on probation on an unrelated cheque fraud conviction. But, as Anthony had not been seen in . public, lawyers for Miss Gonzalez feared she might go missing and . decided to track her down. They . staked out her home for several days without Anthony appearing to be . served a subpoena. Eventually, the defendant's lawyers intervened and . said she would attend the court hearing.

But researchers have today suggested that drivers using hands-free kits could pose almost as much of a safety risk as those illegally holding their mobile to their ear. A Canadian study found that drivers using hands-free devices were significantly more likely to make a host of potentially hazardous errors - from speeding to switching lanes without indicating - than drivers not talking on the phone. Not as safe as you think? Researchers in Canada say hands-free devices that allow people to talk at the wheel can still increase the risk of driver error . Sales of hands-free phone devices have . soared in the UK in recent years since it became against the law to use a . mobile phone normally while driving. The law banning drivers and motorcyclists from using hand-held phones or similar devices came into force ten years ago. The possible punishments for drivers or riders caught using their mobile range from a £60 fixed penalty and three penalty points, to being disqualified from driving and issued with a maximum fine of £1,000. The only instances in which drivers are allowed to use their phone are if they need to call 999 in an emergency and it is unsafe or impractical to stop, or if they are safely parked. Drivers are permitted to use hands-free kits, sat navs and two-way radios while driving or riding, but could still face a penalty should they be stopped by police who deem them to be distracted and not in control of their vehicle. It was thought that using a hands-free device significantly cut the risk of driver error, when compared to holding a phone to the ear. But the new study found that drivers using a hands-free phone made significantly more errors - such as crossing a centre line, speeding, or changing lanes without indicating first - compared to those not using a phone. A study led by Professor Yagesh Bhambhani, of the University of Alberta in Canada, showed the jump in errors also corresponded with a spike in heart rate and brain activity. Researchers looked at the brain activity of 26 participants who completed a driving course using a driving simulator. Participants were first tested in a . 'control' condition - using the simulator to drive through virtual city streets while using no telecommunications device. They . were then tested again while talking on a hands-free device. The drivers were engaged in two-minute conversations that avoided emotionally charged topics. Danger: Sales of hands-free kits soared after it became illegal to use a mobile phone in the usual way while behind the wheel . Researchers found there was a significant increase in brain activity while talking on a hands-free device compared with the control condition. Prof Bhambhani said: 'The findings also indicated that blood flow to the brain is significantly increased during hands-free telecommunication in order to meet the oxygen demands of the neurons under the ""distracted"" condition.'","Study shows hands-free devices lead to sharp increase in driver errors .

"By . Peter Allen and Lyle Brennan . PUBLISHED: . 11:35 EST, 27 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:59 EST, 28 March 2012 . Fanatic: Gunman Mohammed Merah, who is said to have recorded the footage sent to Al-Jazeera . A disturbing video showing the killings of three French soldiers and four people at a Jewish school was sent to a TV network - but not by the gunman who filmed it, police said. The revelation raises the possibility of an accomplice to the crimes. Arabic TV network Al-Jazeera has said it will not air the footage of the Toulouse shootings after the video arrived at its office in Paris. It appears to have been recorded during Mohammed Merah's deadly attacks earlier this month. The decision not to broadcast the video, which was sent on a USB memory stick along with a letter to the station, came after French president Nicolas Sarkozy and family of the victims had asked for it not to be shown. Police believe it was filmed by the gunman himself, who was killed last week after a 32-hour stand-off with police at his apartment. Merah recorded all of his murders, which began on March 11 with the shooting of a French soldier. Before the rampage ended, two more soldiers, three Jewish children and a rabbi were killed. Al-Jazeera's announcement came as it emerged that Merah's convicted criminal father plans to sue the French government for ‘murdering’ his son. In what is likely to be one of the most controversial legal actions in criminal history, Mohammed Benalel Merah wants an apology and compensation. This is despite the fact that he is a convicted drug dealer who had next to nothing to do with his son from the age of six, and now lives in Algeria. Mr Merah, who is in his 60s, said that his son, who murdered seven people in total, stood ‘no chance’ against the police. Meanwhile, it has been claimed that the killer had spied for the French secret service before his ten-day spree. Italian . newspaper Il Foglio alleges that the Muslim fanatic acted as an . informer to the DGSE intelligence agency while travelling to Israel, . Jordan and Afghanistan in 2010. In return for information about Islamic terror cells, the paper said, French agents allowed Merah to travel freely. Il Foglio claims details of this arrangement were leaked by French and Israeli spies. Respect: President Nicolas Sarkozy delivers a speech today before magistrates and policemen who investigated the shootings. Earlier he joined calls for the gunman's footage not to be aired after it was sent to broadcasters . Elsewhere . on the continent, police in Spain arrested a suspected Al Qaeda member . who is thought to have been key to the terror cell's internet . operations, spreading propaganda and working to recruit jihadists. Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz . said the arrest was not connected to the murders in France, adding that . the Jordanian-born Saudi citizen had 'administered one of the world's . most important jihadist forums'. The letter sent to Al-Jazeera said Merah's killings were carried out in the name of Al Qaeda. Zied Tarrouche, the network's Paris bureau chief, said the note was written in poor French with spelling and grammatical errors. The . images it accompanied appear to have been taken from the point of view . of the killer, he said, perhaps from a camera hung around Merah's neck. They were shaky but of a high technical quality. The video had clearly been edited with . religious songs and recitations of Koranic verses laid over the . footage, Mr Tarrouche said. He added: 'You can hear gunshots at . the moment of the killings. You can hear the voice of this person who . has committed these assassinations. You can hear also the cries of the . victims, and the voices were distorted.' Earlier Mr Sarkozy had asked that the images not be broadcast. 'I . ask the managers of all television stations that might have these . images not to broadcast them in any circumstances, out of respect for . the victims - out of respect for the Republic,' he said. Family: Police arrest Abdelkader Merah, the gunman's older brother. The killer's father has now spoken out in public, vowing to sue the French government for shooting his son dead . There has been no indication that other stations received the footage. Mr Tarrouche said: 'We are not a . sensationalist channel. We're not looking to broadcast images without . weighing the risks and the consequences. That's why the management will . decide today after meeting at headquarters in Qatar.' The decision not to broadcast the images came a few hours later. As . France tries to come to terms with the attacks shown in the video, the . gunman's estranged father says French special forces could easily have . ‘taken my son alive’. Mr Merah said: ‘They could have used gas to capture him, but they preferred to kill him. ‘I’m . going to hire the biggest named lawyers and work for the rest of my . life to pay their costs. I will sue France for killing my son.’ Siege: A hooded policeman looks out of a window at the bullet-ridden apartment where Merah made his last stand. The killer's father claims police could have taken him alive . His move was immediately condemned by . Mr Sarkozy’s government, who revealed that Mohammed Benalel Merah spent . four years in prison in Toulouse before returning to his homeland of . Algeria. In 1999 he was arrested for drug . dealing on the Toulouse estate where Mohammed junior grew up, and in . June 2000 he was sentenced to five years in prison. The term was . increased by nine months for witness tampering. Alain . Juppe, France’s foreign secretary, said: ‘If I was the father of a . monster like that, I’d shut up out of shame’, while a spokesman for Mr . Sarkozy said the legal action was ‘abhorrent’. Anti-terrorist prosecutor Francois Molins, meanwhile, said police did ‘everything they could to arrest Merah alive’. The French authorities' activities prior to Merah's killings have also come into question. Security chiefs were today refusing to comment on Il Foglio's claim that they may have been working with the killer before his attacks in south-west France. The Italian newspaper said: 'Merah was considered to fit the profile of the kind of young man who could infiltrate terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and provide crucial intelligence to western countries.' Prime Minister Francois Fillon last week defended the state's intelligence agencies and insisted France had had 'no grounds' to detain Merah before he went on his rampage. He told French radio: 'There was no single element to allow for the detention of Mohammed Merah. France mourns: Hundreds of people gather in Toulouse's Capitol square for a minute's silence in memory of Merah's victims . 'Intelligence agents had watched him for long enough to come to the conclusion that there was no indication that this was a dangerous man who would one day pass from words to acts. 'Merah was interrogated, watched and listened to, and appeared to be a man living a normal life.' The self-styled Islamic warrior, who was shot dead by police marksmen, is said to be buried in Algeria, so that his grave will not be desecrated in France. Merah’s brother, 29-year-old Abdelkader Merah, has been charged with aiding and abetting the terrorist. Both brothers are thought to have been members of radical Islamic groups in Toulouse, and Merah was known to security services in both France and America. Spanish police today arrested a suspected member of Al Qaeda who was key to the terror group's internet propaganda and recruiting operations, officials said. The suspect arrested in the eastern city of Valencia 'administered one of the world's most important jihadist forums', dedicated to recruiting and indoctrinating Islamic terrorists, Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said. The name of that forum and the suspect's name were not given, only his initials, MHA. He is Jordanian-born with Saudi citizenship. 'He was known within the organisation as Al Qaeda's librarian,' Mr Fernandez Diaz said, without specifying what that term meant in this case. The suspect worked at home for '8 to 15 hours a day' for Al Qaeda and for two offshoots, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the minister said. 'He spread jihadist ideas and worked to recruit and arrange transportation of possible jihadists to Afghanistan and other countries where terrorism is very active,' Mr Fernandez Diaz said. The Interior Ministry said in a statement he was arrested as part of a probe that determined the man used the Web to distribute videos designed to encourage terrorist acts, the ministry said in a statement. The minister said the raid in which he was arrested was not linked to the recent killings in Toulouse, France. However, he added that gunman Mohammed Merah became indoctrinated thanks to the work of people like the Valencia suspect. Spanish authorities said today's arrest stemmed from a probe that began in February 2011. The suspect was arrested at home on orders from an investigating magistrate in Madrid.","Arabic broadcaster says it will not air the disturbing footage after plea from Nicolas Sarkozy .

With Pete suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 23, having a heart attack in 2006 and finally suffering a cancer relapse three years later, their relationship has been tested to its limit. And with exercise and dieting the last things on their mind, the two found they were piling on the pounds too. When Pete was given the all clear from cancer in 2009 and released from hospital, the pounds just kept creeping on. But now the couple have decided to battle against the weight - and each other - and have now lost over 7st each - using their Wii fit machine. Thanks to making some simple changes to their diet and regular routines on the Wii Fit and dance games, the couple have lost over 7 stone each - but Michelle has lost 3lbs more . Michelle and Pete started piling on the pounds after Pete was released from hospital having suffered from cancer . Michelle has got the edge thanks to . putting in the extra hours on the Wii after their three children had . gone to bed, and has lost three pounds more than Pete. Full-time mother Michelle, 37, said: 'I saw a photo of myself on a night out and I looked like a giant beast. 'I said to Pete 'Why didn't you tell me I was fat?' and he claimed he thought I knew. 'We're very competitive with everything we do - and the weight loss was no different. There have been times when I've thought about cheating and slipping a sugar or two into his coffee. 'I started using the Wii to tone up and it's clearly paid off. Pete, who was diagnosed with non-Hodgekins Lymphoma when he was 23, suffering a heart attack in 2006 and a relapse of the cancer in 2009, says he began to eat loads when he came out of hospital . Michelle used the Wii Fit to get the upper hand in weight loss battle with her husband, doing extra work outs after the children had gone to bed . Michelle was shocked when she saw unflattering pictures of herself on Facebook and was motivated to start losing weight . Michelle says she started using the Wii as it was fun and she didn't want to end up with saggy excess skin . 'Now we've reached our target weights it feels great. I can do so much more and I feel much healthier.' Pete, 38, was first diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of cancer that affects the lymph nodes, when he was 23. It led to weakening of his organs and he suffered a heart attack in 2006, followed by a relapse of the cancer in 2009. Pete, an engineer, said: 'I was eating loads when I came out of hospital. I had to have a stem cell transplant which left my immune system very low and weak. Eating built my strength back up. 'We couldn't go out much so we'd just stay in and eat. The super-trim couple now plan to  celebrate by taking a family holiday together . 'But when Michelle saw that picture of herself on Facebook, we realised how bad our eating had become and decided to do something about it. 'I was in bad condition so I went along to classes with her. I do all the cooking and the healthy eating plan really appealed to me.' The couple started Slimming World classes in June 2010 and after a break returned in February 2012. Michelle has dropped from a size 24 to a svelte size 12, and Pete has gone from a waist size of 44 inches to 34 inches. Michelle said: 'I was tired of being the fat, funny friend. Everyone around you is always so slim and I had to prove them wrong. 'Pete and I go through everything together and this is no different. As well as using Wii the competitive couple joined Slimming World and won the title of 'couple of the year' for their joint 14 stone weight loss . 'At first he just came to support me, but he got involved and we'd keep checks on how much the other had lost. 'It made it fun - and we had something to prove. 'I started using the Wii because I didn't want to end up with excess skin, so I've been doing yoga and playing the dance games with the girls to tone up. 'It's great fun and good for you - and it's paid off because I've lost three pounds more than Pete.' Pete and Michelle have three daughters - Lauren, 10, Katie, nine and Mollie, four. They are taking them abroad for the first time later this year. Michelle said: 'I was tired of being the fat, funny friend. Everyone around you is always so slim and I had to prove them wrong' Pete said: 'We're taking the girls to Disneyworld in Florida. 'Before there were so many things we had to worry about - would the seat belt fit? Would we get on the rides? - but now we can go and enjoy ourselves.' Michelle said: 'I wouldn't even go to the park with the girls before. The walk there was bad enough. 'But now I'm always outside playing games with them. I've even got a pair of roller skates. 'You're not the best parent when you're overweight. We've given them their childhood back.' The couple were nominated for this year's Couple of the Year award, but narrowly missed out on the top prize. Michelle said: 'Everyone's stories are so inspiring - I hope we can be like that one day. 'An old friend saw me and couldn't believe how much weight I'd lost. Now she's started a slimming class too. 'Our friends got used to us being the fat couple so now we've lost weight it makes them realise that it is possible. 'If after everything we've been through we can lose weight - then anyone can.' Maureen Yardley leads the couple's Slimming World group in the Leicestershire village of Blaby. She said: 'I'm extremely proud of the efforts they made to lose weight and they should rightly be proud of themselves. 'The family has been through such a lot in the past few years.'","Michelle 37, and Pete Lakin, 38, competed to be first to lose 7st .

If a trip to the art gallery is beyond your means or impossible because of distance, then the National Gallery has the answer. It is going to give cinemagoers the chance of a detailed view of its paintings along with their popcorn. The National Gallery has said its major autumn show on Johannes Vermeer, the 17th-century master, will be beamed into cinemas worldwide, using new digital technology able to show the paintings in unprecedented detail. Available in cinemas worldwide: Paintings such as Johannes Vermeer's The Love Letter from 1670 in London's National Gallery will be shown in 30 countries . Pioneering: Award-winning director Phil Grabsky is turning three major exhibitions into films beginning in April . The pioneering initiative - designed to bring highbrow exhibitions closer to those who live away from major UK cities - will use groundbreaking technology to show the images in incredible detail. Phil Grabsky, an award-winning British documentary film-maker, says that art is to be seen for the first time with 4K, which is four times clearer than HD. ‘It is completely new. It is being talked about as possibly putting an end to 3D because it’s so powerful. ‘We’ll be the first to film artworks using this technology… People will be see artworks with a quality that was previously totally impossible.’ Its potential is huge, he tells the Daily Mail. Beyond taking audiences to exhibitions which a huge majority could never otherwise see, it could allow masterpieces like Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel ceiling - which can only be admired from afar - to be seen close up, without a crush of elbows and craned necks. Grabsky says: ‘I would always urge people to go to a gallery and have direct communication with a painting. But, for the millions who can’t, this is absolutely the next best thing.’ The success of his pilot, which took the National Gallery’s Leonardo exhibition into 1,000 cinemas worldwide, suggests real demand. In Britain alone, it went into 41 cinemas, 39 sold out - and that, even without the new technology. Showing at London's Royal Academy: Cinema audiences will be able to see paintings like 'Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe' by Edouard Manet thanks to a film of the exhibition . The Metropolitan Opera, New York, led the way in seeing cinema’s potential. Its productions are now shown in 1,900 cinemas in 64 countries and, since 2006, have sold 12 million tickets. Now Grabsky plans to take art into 1,500 cinemas in almost 30 countries. In Britain, Vermeer will screen in 70 cinemas, including VUE and Picturehouse/ City Screen. Premiering in October, it will focus on a master whose Girl with a Pearl Earring inspired the acclaimed 2003 film with Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth. Grabsky says that 4K and cinema’s huge screens will reveal secrets of Vermeer’s astonishing technique: 'Anyone who’s looked at a Vermeer thinks ‘how on earth does he do that?' In April, he will also offer cinema audiences a ‘visit’ to the current Manet exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, and, in June, to Munch at the Oslo National and Munch museums. The Edvard Munch show in Oslo: Cinema audiences will be able to see paintings like The Scream in June . However, unlike the Vermeer, they were shot before 4K technology became available. The films’ presenter is Tim Marlow, renowned art historian and broadcaster. He says: 'Although there’s no substitute for looking at pictures with the naked eye, you can use a camera to see things in ways you hadn’t known were possible.' Grabsky, whose previous productions include award-winning history films with Monty Python’s Terry Jones, is now planning further films of major 2014 art exhibitions. Charles Saumarez Smith, the Royal Academy’s head, says: 'It is exciting that new advances in digital technology will allow an even greater viewing experience for art lovers.'","Manet, Munch and Vermeer exhibitions will be available in cinemas .

The UK Independence Party’s dramatic wins of more than 140 seats revealed a colourful new band of councillors across the country. They include a descendent of Guy Fawkes, a mother and two daughters and a candidate who did no campaigning at all. But none of the candidates who caused the party embarrassment with claims of Nazi salutes, pictures with Hitler and Holocaust denial were successful at the ballot box. Family affair: Sue Ransome, (right) and her two daughters, Elizabeth Ransome, 26, (left) and Felicity Ransome, 27, (centre)all took seats in local elections in Boston, Lincolnshire . Nail-biting stuff: Sue Ransome, 61, shows off her polish in party colours after winning a seat on Lincolnshire council . UKIP leader Nigel Farage today insisted that only a ‘handful caused us embarrassment’ but vowed to toughen up checks for wannabe politicians. But he expressed delight at the number of members elected to county councils across the country. He said: ''We have been abused by everybody, the entire establishment, and now they are shocked and stunned that we are getting over 25 per cent of the vote everywhere we stand across the country. This is a real sea-change in British politics.' UKIP became the second largest party in Lincolnshire, winning 16 seats and depriving Conservatives of overall control. Among the UKIP winners in Lincolnshire  were a mother and two daughters. Sue Ransome, 61, and her daughters Felicity and Elizabeth Ransome, 27 and 26, gained three seats in elections in Boston. The mother of four took the Boston East seat with 675 votes while Felicity took Boston Coastal with 826 votes and Elizabeth took Boston Fishtoft with 837 votes. Mrs Ransome said: 'I can't quite believe it. We're used to coming second, third, but never first. It's great, a dream come true.' Her husband Ron stood for Boston South, along with their daughter Jodie Sutton, 36, in Boston Rural - both came second. Mr Ransome added: 'Our time has come - I'm used to always being the bridesmaid - but at least I've got a few brides with me now.' Surprise win: Ian Smith celebrates winning a seat on Dorset County Council, despite not campaigning or even turning up to the count. He didn't even own a UKIP rosette . Winners: In Essex UKIP won nine seats on the county council, including three wards in the Basildon and Wickford districts taken by (left to right) Mark Ellis, Kerry Smith and Nigel Le Gresley . In Dorset, Ian Smith became UKIP's first ever councillor despite not campaigning or even turning up to the count. His name did not appear on any leaflets, he does not own a UKIP rosette and only agreed to stand three weeks ago. He only found out he had been elected by email this morning. 'My initial reaction was ""my goodness!"" I was shocked but I'm very happy,' he said as he posed for pictures cracking open champagne. A distant relation of Guy Fawkes was among the UKIP winners. Retired headteacher Philip Fawkes and the would-be bomber shared a common ancestor in the Gunpowder Plotter's 15th century great-great-grandfather. Mr Farage said it showed 'the blood of rebellion still runs in his veins'. UKIP supporters celebrate after Colin Guyton (second right) wins a seat on Gloucestershire County Council . Nigel Farage said the election in Hampshire of Philip Fawkes, a distant relation of Guy Fawkes, showed 'the blood of rebellion still runs in his veins' Mr Fawkes won the South Waterside ward in Hampshire County Council, defeating Tory Alexis McEvoy, who pinned the blame on the Prime Minister. 'Clearly the message was to the government. I hope the government will listen because they never do,' she told the BBC.

A militant on foot blew himself up, then a huge blast from a truck bomb destroyed much of a local bazaar near the military outpost in Wardak province's Sayedabad district. Four Afghan police officers and eight civilians were among the dead. The 53 injured - some with 'serious' wounds - included two Nato troops and 10 policemen.

'The number of wounded is so high that it can hardly be counted,' said Wardak police spokesman Abdul Wali. The bombings around dawn in the town about 40 miles from Kabul, served as a reminder that even after a decade of fighting, U.S. and foreign troops are still engaged in a war despite the start of a withdrawal of coalition forces. One of the suicide bomber detonated a vest rigged with explosives outside a compound housing the district governor's office, while the other detonated the tanker bomb on a road separating the compound from the base.

'It broke windows all over the area.' 'Most of the injuries are from broken glass from the windows of homes and shops. It was so powerful we couldn't find much of the truck.' Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack, which he said was targeting the U.S. base.

A crooked court clerk who helped at least 53 offenders escape justice yesterday became the first person to be jailed under new bribery laws. Munir Patel, 22, received a three-year prison term for taking bribes. He was also given six years for misconduct in a public office. The sentences will run concurrently. He used his privileged access to official databases in the back rooms of a magistrates’ court to wipe the convictions of motorists from the records – in return for £500 a time from the accused. He also advised defendants on how to avoid being brought to court, while working in an administrative capacity at Redbridge Magistrates’ Court in East London, on a salary of £17,978. Patel was filmed by a hidden camera boasting that he took bribes ‘all day long’. For his known corruption Patel was paid at least £20,000, but the total profits of his corruption may have been around £96,000. Police believe he helped at least 53 people accused of driving offences. At Southwark Cown Court, Patel, of . Dagenham, Essex, admitted bribery and misconduct in a public office . between February 2009 and August this year. The court heard that £53,814 in cash . was deposited in his bank account while another £42,383 was transferred . into the same account, both without explanation. Jailing .

It was widely expected that the first case involving the much-heralded Bribery Act legislation, which superseded century-old laws, would involve a high-profile corporate case. The Serious Fraud Office had announced it would use the Act to pursue big companies and foreign businesses suspected of bribery. The Bribery Act, which was introduced . in July, covers offering a bribe, passively receiving inducements, . bribing foreign officials and failing to stop bribes on behalf of a . company.",Munir Patel sentenced to three years for bribery and six years for misconduct in a public office .

Pricey: This Pre-Raphaelite artwork which was unearthed among household junk was auctioned by Christie's for a staggering £589,250 . When schoolteacher Jane Cordery was told that a dusty painting of an owl she had found in her  attic could sell for about £70,000, she was naturally astonished. But last week the estimate turned out to be  wrong – by rather a large margin. The Pre-Raphaelite artwork she unearthed among her household junk was auctioned by Christie’s for a staggering £589,250. The price has broken the world auction record  for the Victorian artist William James Webbe, who painted the picture in 1856. His works rarely appear on the market and the highest price paid for one until last week was just £72,000. Ms Cordery, 66, said of the sale price: ‘It was such a shock. We were not imagining that in our wildest dreams.’ She stumbled across the picture during a long-overdue clear-out at her home in Basingstoke, Hampshire, helped by her 69-year-old partner, James Ravenscroft, and their three grown-up children. The battered painting emerged from mounds of clothes, books and toys as the family made space around some pipes for a plumber. It turned out to be a picture that had been exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856 when renowned critic of the time John Ruskin admired the softness of the bird’s feathers as ‘perhaps inimitable’. Mr Ravenscroft, who runs a rubber-recycling company, had long ago forgotten receiving the painting as a gift from his mother. Ms Cordery, an art teacher, emailed a photograph of the owl to Christie’s, where expert Brandon Lindberg immediately saw its potential and the work was valued at £70,000 – as The Mail on Sunday reported last month. He said: ‘I thought the picture had magic but there wasn’t anything to support a price stronger than we’d suggested in the estimate. Everyone seemed to fall under its spell.’ It was bought by an anonymous British dealer – and now Ms Cordery and her family may treat themselves to a holiday in Africa or Australia. And if they hadn’t bothered having that clear-out? ‘It doesn’t bear thinking about,’ she said.",The price has broken the world auction record  for the Victorian artist William James Webbe - who painted the picture in 1856 .

Hundreds of young women from around the world are kicking their dance routines into high gear in New York this week in hopes of joining dance troupe the Rockettes. The aspiring dancers lined up Tuesday morning on a Manhattan street - getting only 30 seconds each to audition for a chance to be in the 2013 Radio City Christmas Spectacular. Amid noisy rush-hour traffic, their hair was neatly pulled back. Their makeup was perfect, some batting fake eyelashes. And they all wore high-heeled dance shoes. Scroll down for video . Each dancer had only 30 seconds to impress the panel at the open audition for the Radio City Hall Christmas Spectacular . Dancers reportedly earn $1,500 a week on the show, performing five times a day . The girls were trying to impress the judging panel to become one of 80 dancers in the Rockettes troupe for the 2013 Christmas season . Chelsey Knapper, in the striped jacket, was back for a second audition after missing out in 2012. The 22-year-old from Detroit, Michigan said it was her 'dream' to dance with The Rockettes . Tyler Clark, 21, from Boston, warmed up for her third attempt at making her way into the dance troupe . 'I've always wanted to do this,' said Chelsey Knapper, 22, of Detroit, who didn't survive last year's auditions. For this 'cattle call' - as the free-for-all lineup is called - Knapper and the others were led upstairs into a rehearsal studio to perform a dance routine before a panel of judges. The quick, precise routine includes a double pirouette and a leg extension. Those who survive through the end of the week - a good dozen or so - will still have to wait months to find out if they'll actually be invited to join the holiday show that runs from November 8 to December 30. Madison Square Garden Entertainment, which produces the show, declined to discuss earnings. But Rockettes reportedly earn about $1,500 a week. Dancer Liz Daniels, from San Diego, stretched out during the warm up - but was turned away for a third time . Daniels, center, said her rejection was not disappointing: 'That's how it goes' The show is directed and choreographed by Linda Haberman, who put the girls through their paces . Haberman told dancers: 'I either keep you or cut you' They pay their own expenses to get to New York because, Knapper said, 'I'd love to be on the line, it's my dream.' Groups of dancers waited their turn at either side of the studio. Some wiped beads of nervous sweat off their foreheads, fanning themselves. Others leaned down for sips of bottled water as ceiling fans whirred to keep the space cool. On her third try to become a Rockette, 'I just got cut,' said Liz Daniels, 27, of San Diego, California. 'You get one shot,' she added. 'But it's not disappointing; there's all kinds of choreography, and that's how it goes.' Only a dozen dancers are expected to make it through this week's auditions . The dancers all wore leotards and heeled shoes while their hair was pulled back . Dancers from around the world head to New York every April for the open Rockettes auditions . The auditionees had to prove they were great at ballet, tap and jazz - with only 30 seconds to show what they could do . To audition, prospective Rockettes must be between 5ft 6in and 5ft 10in and proficient in ballet, tap, and jazz. Directing the whole Christmas spectacular is choreographer Linda Haberman. 'I either keep you or cut you,' she said. Whoever survives the cutthroat process will join a troupe of about 80 Rockettes who are 'a part of history, an iconic part of New York City,' Haberman said. Another 40 or so Rockettes go on the road. Dancers wanted to be part of the troupe's long history - it has been performing at Radio City Music Hall since 1935 . Marie Schou, from St Louis, took a moment to perfect her lipstick before she took her turn to audition . Every dancer wore perfect makeup for her audition. New Yorker Catherine Wolfson, 20, took a moment to curl her lashes before her turn . Dancers took every spare moment to adjust their appearance before their audition slot . Prospective Rockette Elizabeth Moran is in her 30s - 'that's older for a Rockette,' she said with a wry smile, explaining her reluctance to give her exact age. 'I've loved the Rockettes ever since I was younger,' said Moran, who lives in New York City and works in finance for a Dutch bank. Knapper, who was taking her second shot at a spot on stage, said: 'People spend years trying out.' Her backup plan is medical school. Auditions always happen in April despite the show being half a year away . Tracey Munn, 25, right, had travelled to the city from California for her eighth attempt at joining the Rockettes . The 'cattle call' was performed in a rehearsal studio in front of a judging panel . Monica Woods, 21, didn't last the day, but said: 'I'll be back, for sure.' 'You learn not to take it personally,' said Woods, who is graduating from Fordham University this year. She comes from Mascoutah, an Illinois community with one traffic light and a population of about 7,000. Monica Woods, 21, was unsuccessful on her second audition but vowed to try again next year . The audition routine included a double pirouette and a leg extension . Signed with a talent agency for musical theater work, she said she will keep auditioning while working at a coffee shop. 'Everyone is kind of in the same boat - nervous but trying not to act like you're nervous,' she said. 'You just put on a smile. I love it, though.'","Open auditions were held for the 2013 Radio City Christmas show .
