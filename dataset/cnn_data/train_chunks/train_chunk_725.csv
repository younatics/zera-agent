The first picture has emerged of the 79-year-old African American victim of an alleged racially-motivated 'knockout game' assault. Conrad Alvin Barrett, 27, has been charged with a hate crime for allegedly filming himself sucker-punching the elderly man, breaking his jaw and knocking out his teeth, last month. The victim has not been named. Barrett today made a brief appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Frances Stacy, who scheduled a detention hearing for the Katy man. Scroll down for video . Victim: This is the 79-year-old man Conrad Alvin Barrett, of Katy, is accused of brutally assaulting . Vicious: Conrad Alvin Barrett, 27, has  been accused of committing a hate crime . According to prosecutors, the . attack happened on November 24 in Katy, Texas, but it wasn't until 12 days later that . authorities connected the attack to the cellphone video of it. Authorities . learned of the case because Barrett allegedly showed the video on the . night of the attack to an off-duty arson investigator he had just met at . a restaurant in nearby Folshear. According . to the criminal complaint, Barrett asked the off-duty investigator and . the woman with the investigator if they knew about the knockout game. He . told them he played earlier that day, then showed them the video, . prosecutors allege. The investigator then flagged down a uniformed officer across the street and led him to Barrett. The . attack video doesn't show Barrett's face, but investigators matched his . voice to the voice in the video and the couple at the restaurant told . investigators that Barrett was wearing the same shorts and shoes at the . person who shot the video. According to prosecutors, the video . shows Barrett approach the victim and ask, 'How's it going, man?' A 'loud smack' is then heard, the victim falls to the ground, Barrett . laughs and says, 'Knockout'. The assailant then flees in his vehicle. The victim lost three teeth and needed surgery to repair his jaw, which had been broken in two places. He was hospitalized for more than four days, authorities said. Investigators retrieved other videos from Barrett's phone, including some in which he uses racial epithets and talks about trying to work up the courage to play the knockout game, the complaint states. In one, Barrett says: 'That plan is to see if I were to hit a black person, would this be nationally televised?' U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson said yesterday that such crimes won't be tolerated. Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. 'Evidence of hate crimes will be vigorously investigated and . prosecuted with the assistance of all our partners to the fullest extent . of the law,' Magidson said. Barrett's attorney, George Parnham, . said Barrett has bipolar disorder and has been prescribed heavy . medications to treat it. He said Barrett's family 'feels horribly . sympathetic' for the person who was attacked. 'When you start . peeling back the layers of the onion and look at the mindset behind the . action you soon realize there's a mental issue,' said Parnham, who added . that he's trying to gather as much information about Barrett's mental . health as possible. If convicted of the hate crime charge, Barrett could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined up to $250,000. A similar 'knockout game' in New York .

Central Park is one of the first stops for tourists visiting New York City, but in the not-so-distant future out-of-towners will need flash if they want to take pictures of the Carousel. Once a series of seven super-slim luxury high-rises are built, the southern quarter of the park will be largely covered in shadows according to a new study conducted by the Municipal Art Society (MAS). Every December 21, on the winter solstice, the park will hit its darkest point, with shadows extending 20 blocks into the park - reaching the Lake and Ramble. A blanket of darkness: When seven luxury high-rise buildings are completed, the southern quarter of Central Park will be obscured by shadows . A look into the future: A new report by the Municipal Arts Society shows how seven new skyscrapers will impact light in the park. The above rendering shows what shadows will be case on the equinox . 'It will basically plunge the park into a solar eclipse in the middle of the day,' Layla Law-Gisiko, chair of the Landmarks Committee for Community Board 5, told CBS New York. Sheep Meadow, the large field where New Yorkers spend nice days soaking in the sun, will be obscured and useless for tanning every equinox. While Central Park was created as a public place for rich and poor to enjoy, the buildings in question are being marketed at Russian oligarchs and Chinese tycoons who want apartments with Central Park views (Skyscraper Museum Director Carol WillisÂ  calls these views the 'money shot'). Worst case scenario: On the shortest day of the year, shadows in the park will be as long as 20 blocks - reaching the Lake and Ramble . Seeing the shadow: On the equinox, the new skyscrapers will cast shadows to reach a dozen blocks into the park . The under-construction One57 is one of the buildings in this so-called 'Billionaire's Belt' and two of its penthouses sold for a reported $90million each. While outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg has argued that it's in the city's interest to attract wealthy foreigners to live here, most of them buy up New York apartments as second-homes, and therefore avoid having to pay the city's income tax. Another problem is that most of these buildings are being constructed 'as of right' meaning they don't need to undergo an environmental assessment or public review. The new New York: The buildings in orange are the current developments planned for the 'billionaire's belt' south of the park . Shooting up: Wollman Rink is pictured in this foreground view of Central park with the new future buildings in orange . And these buildings will be some of the tallest in the Western Hemisphere. The Nordstrom Tower will be 1,424 feet tall, which is higher than the top floor of 1 World Trade Center and the proposed 1,350 foot 111 West 57th Street building will be higher than the Empire State Building's observation deck. These buildings are able to reach such heights because they've bought up the air rights from their surrounding buildings. Before and after: A view of 57th street now and what it will look like with the addition of the skyscrapers in development . Casting shadows: The graphic above shows how large a shadow the 1,000-foot-tall building at 217 West 57th Street will create . Only for the wealthiest: One57 is expected to be one of the tallest high-rise apartments in the world. Two of their penthouses recently sold for $90million each . Advances in skyscraper engineering mean these buildings can be constructed super slim - about two townhouses wide in some cases - occupying plots of land originally suited for 40-story buildings. In their report, the Municipal Art Society proposes a re-appraisal of zoning codes to ensure that there's more oversight and public involvement in making this new breed of skyscrapers. 'It's troubling that the sky's the limit when it comes to one of our most precious public spaces,' MAS President Vin Cipolla told the New York Daily News. 'We need to protect these spaces.' Tunnel vision: 57th Street itself will be significantly darkened with these new constructions . Pushing the boundaries: The buildings under development will be some of the tallest in the Western Hemisphere - not to mention the New York skyline . The new breed of skyscraper: Innovation in . skyscraper engineering means these new buildings can be super-slim and . occupy lots that are just two townhouses wide in some cases .",A new report released by the Municipal Art Society shows how the lower quarter of Central Park will be obscured with the construction of seven new skyscrapers .
"By . Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 12:42 EST, 13 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:13 EST, 13 December 2013 . Hero: Jack Cornwell was 15 when he enlisted in the navy to fight the Germans in 1916 . The last man standing on the deck of HMS Chester as his comrades were shot down in the greatest naval battle of the First World War, Jack Cornwell was harbouring a secret. A besotted patriot, dazzled by his father and older brother in the Navy, he had been desperate to fight for his country when a state of war was declared in 1914. Aged just 13, that was not an option. But Jack would not take no for an answer. In 1915, without telling his father Eli, the mature-looking newspaper delivery boy from east London fashioned himself as a fresh-faced 17-year-old and stood up to serve. It was two years later that the true nature of his valour and courage was revealed. He was shot in the chest in the Battle of Jutland, and when he was brought back to be treated in an English hospital, nurses realised his age. Now, 97 years later, a letter from King George VI to Jack's mother, Lily, has emerged, commending her son for his service, and awarding him the Victoria Cross. The official document informed Lily Cornwell that her 16-year-old son . Jack was to be posthumously awarded the highest decoration for valour . for his heroics in World War I, and invited her to receive it at Buckingham Palace. To this day, he remains the third youngest recipient of the medal. The announcement of Jackâs VC appeared in the London Gazette. It stated: . 'The King has been graciously pleased to approve the grant of the . Victoria Cross to Boy, First Class, John Travers Cornwell for the . conspicuous act of bravery. 'Mortally wounded early in the action, . Boy, First Class, John Travers Cornwell remained standing alone at a . most exposed post, quietly awaiting orders, until the end of the action, . with the gunâs crew dead and wounded all round him. His age was under . sixteen and a half years.' Historic: A letter from King George VI describing the incredible bravery of one of the youngest recipients of the Victoria Cross to his grieving mother has come to light . The teenager had lied about his age to join the Royal Navy at 15 so he could serve along with his father and elder brother in the war effort. After completing his basic training he was assigned to HMS Chester as a gun sight setter and . on May 31, 1916 the ship was on scouting duties at Jutland when it came . under attack by four German cruisers. Chester was hit by 18 150mm shells. Although . the ship was never in danger of sinking, the scene on deck was one of . horror as many of the gun crews had lost lower limbs in the bombardment. Despite all his comrades on the gun being killed and having been hit in the chest by shrapnel, Jack remained stood alone at his post until the end of the action. He was later transferred to hospital in England but he died from the severe chest injuries he had sustained before his mother could arrive. Deadly: The Battle of Jutland was deemed the most crucial naval battle of the First World War . In all, 29 men on HMS Chester were killed in the action, mostly gun operators who lost their legs as the open-backed gun-shields did not reach the deck to give protection. Jackâs mother received the VC from the King on November 16, 1916. The framed Admiralty letter is owned by a private collector who is now selling it next month with a pre-sale estimate of Â£1,000. Matthew Tredwen, of Kent based C&T Auctioneers, said: 'Boy Cornwellâs Victoria Cross is one of the most famous because of his age. 'He was the last man, or in this case boy, left standing on the gun while everyone around him was killed. 'He was mortally wounded and for someone of 16 to carry on with his duty in those circumstances is remarkable. 'When his grieving mother received this letter telling her her late son was to be awarded the VC it must have been a proud moment for her during a terrible time.'","Jack Cornwell was 15 when he enlisted to fight in the Navy in 1915 .

A 26-year-old woman and her two housemates - one of which she was said to be having an affair with - were sitting inside the Burger King restaurant where they work while allegedly concocting a plan to murder the woman's husband at a Pennsylvania park. However the intricate Christmas Eve plot, which included removing the man's teeth and setting his body on fire so it would be harder to identify, was thwarted when a park worker stumbled upon the three with their bleeding intended victim, according to The Post-Gazette. Kimberly Thompkins, 26, Daryith Stevens, 18, and Robert Crosby, 24, are now being held on charges of attempted homicide, conspiracy to commit homicide, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and aggravated assault. Kimberly Thompkins, 26, is being held on a variety of charges, including conspiracy to commit homicide, after allegedly hatching a plan to kill her husband and father of her children, Adam Thompkins, 29. The pair were married in 2006 . Alleged accomplices: Daryith Stevens, 18 (left), and Robert Crosby, 24 (right), are the housemates and Burger King co-workers of Kimberly Thompkins.

The three housemates are alleged to have stabbed and beated Adam Thompkins around 11am on Christmas Eve here, in Cedar Creek Park in Rostraver, when a park employee stumbled upon them . Thompkins was believed to have been having an affair with Crosby and allegedly hatched the plan to kill her husband, 29-year-old Adam Thompkins. The two were married in 2006 and, according to their Facebook photo albums, appear to have three children together. All four adults lived in a house on Eureka Hill Road in Jacobs Creek, a section of South Hampton, which was bought by Mr Thompkins two years ago, records show. On Monday the trio met at the Rotraver Burger King where they work and 'conspired to kill Adam Thompkins', according to an affidavit of probable cause. Police say that on Christmas Eve morning, Ms Thompkins drove her husband to Cedar Creek Park to discuss their marital problems.

Ms. Stevens also brought 'a change of clothes and pliers to pull the victimÃ¢â¬â¢s teeth so he could not be identified,' police wrote. But around 11.15am, before the plan could be completed, park crew leader Frank Backstrom, 52, passed through the area and noticed a man 'bleeding pretty good from the head'. Mr Backstrom approached the group and Mr Crosby told him the man had fallen and that they were taking him to the hospital. Mr Backstrom then left but, worried something was amiss, returned to the area shortly after and found a bloody three-inch blade. He then called police.

The killing of 69 innocent people at a summer camp on the remote Norwegian island of Utoya by the right-wing fanatic Anders Breivik horrified the world over. But two survivors of the island massacre, who met as they swam from their lives, have been helping eachother recover from the ordeal - and fallen in love. Sofie Tommeras Lyshagen, 19, and Hakon Knudsen, 20, fled together as gunman Breivik slaughtered his victims with an assault rifle. Survivors: Sofie Tommeras Lyshagen, 19, and Hakon Knudsen, 20, have fallen in love after meeting as they fled from mass murderer Anders Breivik, 33, as he slaughter 69 people at summer camp on the island of Utoya . Brave: The young couple hope news of their romance will bring joy and show they have not been broken by the ordeal on Utoya island, pictured shortly after the massacre last July . The pair only managed to survive the ordeal last July by swimming away from the island and hiding from Breivik. But as the students comforted eachother over the horrific scenes they witnessed that day they found that they had made more than just a close friend. Sofie, whose ex-boyfriend and best friend were both shot dead at the youth camp on the isle of Utoya, spotted Hakon swimming after she had been shot at. 'Evil': Anders Behring Breivik smiles as he arrives in court in Oslo charged with killing a total of  77 people in twin attacks in Norway last July . She told the Sun newspaper: 'We exchanged a few words and were both quite hysterical. But we have been together ever since. 'It was only later when we were safe in the countryside that the romance began. We felt the chemistry was good and that we understood and could help each other. 'This hasnÃ¢â¬â¢t broken us. We hope to spread a little joy through this Ã¢â¬â our love.' She added that she hopes Breivik, who goes on trial next week accused of mass murder, realises the 'evil he has done to others' but added she still didn't think he comprehended impact of his actions today. Before his attack on Utoya island, Breivik set off a car bomb outside government buildings in Oslo, killing eight people on July 22 last year. He then travelled 25 miles northwest of Oslo, to the summer camp and, dressed as a police officer, spent more than an hour killing a further 69 people. It is expected that Breivik will spend the rest of his life on a psychiatric ward - a fate the gunman described as 'worse than death' in a letter released this week. The 33-year-old wrote: 'To send a political activist to an asylum is more sadistic and more evil than killing him! It is a fate worse than death.' Plea: Breivik said in his letter that to be found criminally insane would be the 'ultimate humiliation' Anders Breivik will use his trial to challenge a diagnosis . that he is criminally insane, something that would be 'worse than . death', excerpts of a letter he wrote showed on Wednesday. The trial of the far-right fanatic, . who gunned down 69 at a Labour Party youth camp after detonating a car . bomb in central Oslo that killed eight, starts in Oslo on April . 16. In November two court-appointed . psychiatrists deemed the 33-year-old was psychotic and paranoid . schizophrenic at the time of the attacks, which would normally mean he . could not be sentenced to prison. In a 38-page letter he wrote in jail . and sent to various Norwegian media - of which extracts were published . in the daily VG on Wednesday - Breivik said that being deemed criminally . insane was unbearable to him. 'I must admit this is the worst thing that could have happened to me as it is the ultimate humiliation,' he wrote. 'To send a political activist to a . mental hospital is more sadistic and evil than to kill him! It is a fate . worse than death.' Breivik has said he committed the . attacks on July 22 last year to protect Norway from multiculturalism. They were the worst outbreak of violence there since the end of World . War Two. 'I knew of course what was right and what was wrong, but I acted instinctively,' Breivik wrote in the letter. He criticised the two psychiatrists, Torgeir Husby and Synne Soerheim, as unable to be objective. 'Husby said on several occasions that . what I had done was bestial and I got the impression from him that he . saw me as a wild animal that had to be locked in and drugged at whatever . cost.' 'Has an event that has traumatised a . nation also traumatised Husby and Soerheim to such an extent that they . must be regarded as having a conflict of interest? Can two . court-appointed psychiatrists that are so emotionally affected by July . 22 mean that they are not able to be objective?' After a public outcry following the . publication of the first psychiatric report, the judges in the case have . asked for another evaluation of Breivik's mental health by different . experts. That is due to be published on Tuesday.","Breivik writes letter to newspapers urging judges not to find him criminally insane, which he calls 'a fate worse than death'"

Millions of families are being asked if they would drink water from recycled sewage to avoid shortages. Thames Water, which supplies more than 3.5million homes in London and the Thames Valley, will face a deficit of 125million litres a day by the end of the decade if no action is taken. That is roughly equivalent to the amount needed for a million baths. As well as reducing leakage and wastage, and introducing more water meters, the company is now asking customers for their views on drinking recycled toilet water. Reusing waste water is common in drier climates such as Australia, Spain and the US, but a relatively untested technology in Britain. It involves putting treated effluent from a sewage works back into a river upstream of a water treatment plant. The diluted waste is then treated to drinking quality standards before being supplied to customers. With Londonâs population continuing to grow, its ageing utilities are struggling to keep up with demand. By 2040, Thames Water will have a 16 per cent deficit if it does not boost its output â leaving 2.2million people short of water. Recycling sewage into drinking water is being considered toÂ  meet shortfalls from 2025, with the most likely site in east London, under the firmâs draft resources plan for 2015 to 2040. Currently, Thames Water is investigating recycling used household water â including effluent from dishwashers, washing machines, baths and toilets â at a plant in Enfield, north London. None of the water is being put back into supply. The company said the claim that water drunk in the capital has already gone through the human body seven times is a myth.

By 2040, Thames Water will have a 16 per cent deficit if it does not boost its output - leaving 2.2million people short of water . But it did admit that a small amount of . todayâs drinking water could come from waste, with treated sewage from . locations such as Reading and Oxford discharged into the Thames before . being purified at downriver plants and pumped to residents in London. The fact that consumers have already been drinking reused water may help convince them not to reject the method. Thames Water said: âAfter 2025 we are likely to require a major new source of water. 'On the basis of what we know now, this would be either a large new reservoir or a major water transfer scheme from elsewhere in the country or significant reuse of waste water. âThe purpose of the consultation is to explain the pros and cons of all these options to our customers and seek their views.â Most utilities get their supplies from two major sources, rivers or groundwater â the latter tends to be cleaner. After being passed through grilles to remove large items of debris, the water is pumped into plantsÂ  where chemicals are added to help remove finer particles such as mud and silt. It is then passed throughÂ  a fine filter, often a bed ofÂ  sand which contains micro- organisms that provide additional cleaning by breaking down any organic compounds. The water is then aerated to remove pesticides and any remaining organic compounds, helping to achieve a more neutral taste. In the final stage, chlorine is added as a disinfectant before the water is supplied to the consumer.","Thames Water supplies 3.5million homes in London and Thames Valley .

Two soldiers who abused Afghans will have their identities protected to prevent them being targeted by terrorists. A 22-year-old former private was fined Â£1,000 yesterday after admitting pulling a young boy's hand towards his genitals and telling him, 'Touch my special place'. His 23-year-old comrade, a lance bombardier, was demoted in rank after pleading guilty to racially insulting a local man by photographing him holding a sign reading 'Silly Paki'. But, controversially, the judge at the court martial ruled the soldiers' names should be kept secret following the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby â even though the military 'should not be seen to hide behind the law'. The soldiers admitted the offences at court and their names have not been released (file picture) Two Islamic extremists have been . charged with murdering Drummer Rigby, 25, outside Woolwich barracks in . south-east London two weeks ago. Yesterday Judge Advocate Alan Large, . sitting in Sennelager, Germany, said the guilty soldiers and their . families could be at risk of attack if their anonymity was lifted. 'In the light of recent events in . London and the threat posed by âlone wolvesâ, it seems to me that it . would be wrong to lift the restrictions,' he said. 'I accept that it . would usually be wrong to make such an order and this should not be seen . as an attempt by the military to hide behind the law. 'It was made in response to very specific circumstances and on specific grounds.' The servicemen were attached to the . 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, which was fighting the Taliban in . the Nahr-e Saraj area of Helmand when the offences took place in . December 2011. The former private, known as Soldier X, who has now left the Army, pleaded guilty to two charges of misconduct. In one incident, he was filmed near a . checkpoint with a child aged about five sitting on his knee. Footage . showed him laughing, pulling the boy's hand and telling him to touch his . crotch. Soldier X has now left the Army and was fined Â£1,000 for the offence in 2011 (file picture) He also admitted using abusive language towards an Afghan boy aged around ten who offered to shake his hand. He was cleared of disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind and of forcing an Afghan girl to touch him intimately. Judge Advocate Large accepted there . was no sexual motive behind Soldier X's behaviour towards the young boys . but said it was 'gratuitously unpleasant' and 'totally unacceptable'. The former lance bombardier, Soldier . Y, pleaded guilty to committing a racially aggravated offence by posing . in a photograph with an Afghan man holding the 'Silly Paki' sign. Judge . Advocate Large said his behaviour was 'highly offensive and particularly . stupid'. Military police arrested the pair . after complaints from their comrades. Sentencing both men, the judge . accepted the offences had taken place during a 'demanding operational . situation with risk of attack from insurgents and a persistent IED . threat'. Soldier X admitted pulling an Afghan boy's hand towards his crotch while on patrol in Helmand (file picture) But he said: 'Many soldiers develop . their own strategies for dealing with the pressure of life on . operations. One of those strategies is banter. The boundary between what . is acceptable and what trespasses into unacceptable behaviour is . sometimes unclear and difficult to distinguish. 'Having said that, all soldiers, . particularly those serving in Afghanistan, are fully trained and fully . prepared for all aspects of your duties. Murdered: Drummer Lee Rigby . 'You were briefed on the sensibilities . of the country and aware of the need to respect local customs and . cultures and to avoid any behaviour that could be interpreted as having . sexual or racist connotations which could cause understandable offence . to people in that country.' A third serviceman, Soldier Z, their patrol commander, was cleared of failing in his duty to deal with the offences. The Armed Forces are especially . sensitive to any allegation which could undermine the work they are . doing to win the 'hearts and minds' of people in Helmand. It is the first time that allegations . of abuse against children by British troops have been investigated in . either Iraq or Afghanistan.

A Virginia high school student who plays high school football is also her school's Homecoming Queen. When people learn Ammie Cook played on Patrick Henry High School's football team they usually ask her position. The answer? She was not the kicker, but her boyfriend was. Female high school football players aren't unheard of, but they are uncommon and usually aren't position players. They are more likely to kick, where the physical demands of the sport aren't as great. Halftime: Ammie Cook is crowned Homecoming Queen before she goes back on-field to finish the game . Cook explained one of the Patriots' kickers is actually her boyfriend of eight months, Brian Howell. She was a running back, free safety - and in this, her senior year - homecoming queen. The latter, ironically, is the position that's afforded her a trip to a bowl game. On New Year's Eve Cook will attend the AutoZone Liberty Bowl in Memphis, where she'll join a delegation of 100 other homecoming queens, including one other representative from Virginia. She was invited to participate after a review process where bowl organizers scrutinized her academics and community service record. She'll walk in a parade, visit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and spend time on the field, but not as a player like she's accustomed. Instead she'll be a member of the halftime show, clad in a white evening gown and tiara. Her usual game day attire is pads and a helmet. The 17-year-old, who is barely five feet tall and weighs only about 100 pounds in full uniform, has a small frame but big stature with teammates and coaches. After four years on the PH team she has earned the respect of those who worked with her on the field. She wasn't a starter or a standout, but she played several games and an important role on the team. 'The best thing about Ammie is that she really knew her role,' Patrick Henry coach Alan Fiddler said. 'She jumped in every day at practice and wanted to be on the scout teams and played hard on the scout teams and that helped us.' Teammates: In this November 15, photo, Patrick Henry High School senior Ammie Cook walks off the field with senior Cory Lark after losing in a first-round playoff game at Patrick Henry High School in Roanoke, Virginia . Huddle: Ammie Cook (center) weaves her way through a group of teammates during a first-round playoff game . He said it got players prepared. 'The guys on the team respected her,' he said. In the beginning it wasn't quite as simple. Cook, who got hooked on the sport as an elementary schooler playing flag football, said she was good and liked to play so her mother called about high school football. 'My mom asked for all the information and didn't tell him I was a girl,' she said. Soon after she prepared by lifting weights. Cook said she gained six pounds, which sounded like a point of pride. Her first year no one wanted to tackle her. 'Everyone knew there was a girl,' she said. 'They didn't want to hit a girl.' Brad Bradley, who now coaches at Heritage High School in Lynchburg, was Patrick Henry's coach when Cook joined the team as a freshman. Crowned: In this photo taken on November 19, 2013, Patrick Henry High School football player Ammie Cook holds a portrait of herself as homecoming queen in Roanoke . Good team: Ammie Cook with her boyfriend and teammate Brian Howell . He didn't recall any issues when she came on, but said it was different. In more than a decade of coaching football he's seen a few girls play, but no one like Cook. 'That has been the first girl that came and really stuck it out,' he said. 'She came out there and put the time in during two-a-days in the hot sun. She was not that girl out there playing football to say she played football. She was out there to play.' Bradley respects that.'That's a football player, doesn't matter if it's a girl or guy,' he said. 'It's a football player.' And on the field he said often no one knew whether she was a boy or girl. Once the uniform was on it was hard to pick her out from anyone else. Cook, who readied for home games alongside Patrick Henry's cheerleaders, placed her brown hair, which tumbles past her shoulders, into a long braid and tucked that up inside her helmet. Only a close look would reveal delicate features common to homecoming queens, not ball players. Small but mighty: Five-foot-tall Ammie Cook surrounded by her teammates . Game day: Ammie Cook (left) cheers on her teammates in a first-round playoff game at Patrick Henry High School in Roanoke . When the team traveled her presence was sometimes surprising. Being on the road also presented logistical challenges other players don't have to worry about. 'When we go on away trips I make sure she has a place to change,' Patrick Henry assistant coach Anthony Drakeford explained. 'I took her under my wing and made sure she was taken care of.' He said he also makes sure she sat in the front of the bus when the team traveled. He said she's so small it can be difficult to see her in the back. 'It's almost like I have to protect her,' he said. At least one rival they played this season also had a female player, Drakeford said. Most teams, they do a double take,' he said. 'It's a novelty thing.' According to the National Federation of State High School Associations, female football players are a very lopsided minority. More than a million high school boys played football during the 2012-13 school year, but just 1,531 girls played, according to the organization. In Virginia, just 28 girls played football that season. Locker room: Ammie Cook changed with the cheerleaders to play with her high school's football team . One of the boys: Ammie Cook waits in the boy's locker room during the team's meeting at halftime in a first-round playoff game at Patrick Henry High School . Drakeford said because of Cook there will be more female players in the future. 'It's nothing that she tried to do,' he said, 'but she's a role model to other young girls who have ambition to play football.' That includes his own 11-year-old, who Drakeford said is probably bigger than Cook. The two have adopted one another through football, he said, which his daughter wants to play. Little girls look up to Cook. 'She's doing something most girls don't do,' he said. That was obvious this fall the night Patrick Henry played Carroll County High School. 'She was bracing herself to make a tackle because the guy broke free,' Drakeford said. 'It was her and this guy pretty much one-on-one and he had full head of steam.' He said she could have easily stepped aside. 'But she didn't,' Drakeford said. 'She just sacrificed her body.' She took the brunt of the blow, but made the tackle. Cook's grandfather Dale Simons remembers the play. Patrick Henry High School Ammie Cook sits with teammates (left to right) Larry Becker, Brian Howell and Cory Lark, in the locker room before  a first-round playoff game . He said he his wife, Marilyn Simons, who attended almost every game this season, could hear the hit from the stands and thought they'd need to call an ambulance. 'It was a loud hit,' he said. 'I could hear the hit and I went ""whoa.""' That night the Patriots beat Carroll County 70-22. Dale, whose tone softens when he speaks about his granddaughter, said she's a tomboy. Marilyn said she herself was also that way as a young woman. Cook, whose parents are not together, lives with her grandparents. The tight threesome will ring in the new year together in Memphis. Marilyn, who has been reminding friends and family to look for Cook on TV during the game, said it took some convincing to get her granddaughter to pursue the opportunity. She said Cook didn't even want to send in the paperwork. 'I guess she didn't think she had a chance,' Marilyn said. 'They send it to every homecoming queen.' But when the family returned from a Thanksgiving trip to Florida, an invitation to the game was waiting in the mail for Cook. Post game: Ammie Cook enjoys a meal with her boyfriend Brian Howell (center) and friend Alexander Goss . Cook said she was surprised, just as she was on the fall evening when she was named the school's homecoming queen during halftime. The previous year she was named a homecoming princess, but missed the pomp and circumstance of being crowned because she was in the locker room. Her older sister, a cheerleader, accepted for her. Cook said that this year, the team was present. 'They called my name and I just kind of stood there for a second,' she said. With her helmet off she wore a tiara and a white sash, which covered the number 20 on her jersey, and rested on her bulky shoulder pads. Cook said she almost didn't run for the court. After being on it the year before she wasn't planning to run again. She said football is what's really important to her. 'That's what I love in high school. That's kind of what I'm known for I guess,' she said. 'It helped me meet a lot more people. Homecoming queen, that's kind of like a bonus I guess.'","Ammie Cook, 17, played running back for her high school's team .

Pork, lamb and beef should be 'occasional' indulgences rather than dinner-table staples. They said the global surge in meat and cheese consumption was unsustainable, with the UK 'never more than a few days from a significant food shortage'. The Commons international development committee said farmers should rear more animals on grass because livestock is land and energy intensive and grain should be saved for humans. MPs say pork, lamb and beef should be 'occasional' indulgences rather than dinner-table staples . Phil Stocker of the National Sheep Association said it is the public's right to serve what they like on their dinner table . The report was branded 'naive, dangerous and bitterly disappointing' by farming unions. 'Livestock farming is an essential part of the fabric of the British countryside,' said Charles Sercombe of the NFU. 'We turn otherwise unused parts of land into food and protein that the public can eat as part of a balanced diet. We are using the land as efficiently as possible. 'With many farmers having been dealing with some of the most difficult conditions in years, to encourage the public not to eat meat is unhelpful to say the least.' Phil Stocker of the National Sheep Association said: 'The vast majority of land used for sheep farming is not suitable for any other form of agriculture. The committee said the global surge in meat and cheese consumption was unsustainable, with the UK 'never more than a few days from a significant food shortage' Farming unions branded the report 'naive, dangerous and bitterly disappointing' Less of these: Families are being told to cut down on their consumption of roast beef joints . 'Would it be more efficient just to . leave the land and import our food? Of course not. Millions have grown . up eating meat regularly and it is the public's right to serve what they . like on their dinner table.' But . Sir Malcolm Bruce, the Lib Dem chairman of the Commons committee, said: . 'With the UK never more than a few days away from a significant food . shortage, UK consumers should also be encouraged over time to reduce how . often they eat meat. 'There is no room for complacency about food security over the coming decades if UK consumers are to enjoy stable supplies and reasonable food prices. 'UK aid to help smallholders increase food production in the developing world is of direct benefit to UK consumers as rising world food prices will reduce living standards of hard-pressed UK consumers.' The MPs are demanding ministers tackle food wastage â a study by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers found up to half the food bought from UK supermarkets goes in the bin, often when edible. 'There is no room for complacency about . food security over the coming decades if UK consumers are to enjoy . stable supplies and reasonable food prices.' Sir Malcolm Bruce . The committee's report on global food security said: 'We recommend the Government set targets for food waste reduction for producers and retailers and introduce sanctions for failure to meet the targets.' On the topic of GM food, dubbed 'Frankenstein foods', the MPs recognised the technique was 'controversial' but added: 'GMOs have the potential to make a valuable contribution to food security.' The committee raised concerns about the impact of biofuels â derived from plants such as sugar cane and maize â on the environment and on food prices. Vast swathes of agricultural land are set aside to grow fuel crops, pushing up the price of staple goods. By law, at least 5 per cent of petrol and diesel sold on British forecourts must be biofuel. The MPs called on ministers to consider using domestic stockpiles of food to protect against price hikes. As well as claiming grain should be fed to humans instead of animals, vegetarians and green activists tell steak lovers livestock farming is a major source of harmful greenhouse gases. But a study in 2010 found that going vegetarian may not be as green as it seems. The Cranfield University research found that switching from British-bred beef and lamb to meat substitutes imported from abroad such as tofu and Quorn would increase the amount of land cultivated.","MPs warn UK 'never more than days from a significant shortage'

Scene: Mr Primrose was kidnapped in Indonesia's Aceh province by at least six armed men, police said . Relief: Police and troops had spread out in the region but there was no sign of Mr Primrose or his attackers until earlier today . A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'We have spoken to the Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO), who have confirmed that a British national was involved in an incident in Aceh yesterday and that they are in touch with local authorities and his family. 'Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.' Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond told Real Radio Scotland at an event he attended in Ayrshire earlier today: 'We are concerned. We're in touch with the FCO and we're offering any assistance we can in terms of contact with relatives. 'We've had these situations before. We'll ensure that everything will be done to ensure his safe return to his family.' There were no indications of shots being fired, the BBC reported local police saying. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of an incident and are in touch with the local authorities.' A LinkedIn profile described him as a senior drilling supervisor at Medco E & P Malaka, and claimed he had previously worked in Russia and India in the oil industry. The Government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office warned that there is a high threat from terrorism in Indonesia. It says: 'Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks and have the capacity and intent to carry out these attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country.' It advises visitors to 'exercise caution when travelling to Aceh, Central Sulawesi Province (especially Palu, Poso and Tentena), Maluku Province (especially Ambon), Papua and West Papua Province.' The western coast ofÂ  Aceh was devastated by a tsunami in December 2004. The tsunami, caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake., killed an estimated 170,000 people in Aceh and left about 500,000 homeless. Just months later, in March 2005, a second off-shore earthquake measuring 9.1 on the Richter scale struck the sea bed near Aceh, killing a further 905 people and displacing f thousands more.","Malcolm Primrose was being driven to a work site in Aceh, Indonesia, when he was stopped by a group of armed men .

The Dallas Cowboys have called one of their former players back out of retirement and in return he is giving away his $53,000 gameday paycheck. Jon Kitna played for the Texan team for two years starting in 2009 but retired in January of 2012. From there he returned to his hometown of Tacoma, Washington and became a high school math teacher and the coach of the football team. When his former teammate, quarterback Tony Romo suffered from a back injury that will leave him out of the much anticipated game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday that decides who heads to the playoffs, Kitna texted his old coach and said that he would be happy to help. Back in the game: Jon Kitna played for the Dallas Cowboys for two years (seen here at a November 2010 game) but retired in January 2012 and now he is going back to play on Sunday to fill in for Tony Romo . 'I told Jason (Garrett) if he wants me or somebody to come in and call a play and be able to pull a play off if a bad situation happened, I would be willing to do that,' Kitna told The Dallas Morning News about his communication with the coach. Garrett was clearly in a tough spot because with Romo's injury, the fate of the game would likely fall to Kyle Orton, who has served as Romo's back up for the past two seasons but has not seen much play time. He also tested out three other possible quarterback substitutes, but after just a 30 minute phone call with his old pal Kitna, Garrett agreed to put him back in the game. Kitna, 41, is expected to serve as back up for Orton during the game on Sunday. 'So heâs a very active guy. Heâs a . mentally tough guy... And heâs certainly very young at heart. So it was . good to have him back, good to have him back in the meetings, and (Iâm) excited to see him practice today,' Garrett told the paper. Even . though he is getting back into the game, Kitna isn't forgetting the new . band of teammates he leads in Washington, as he agreed to donate his . earnings from Sunday's game to the school where he was teaching. His new life: Kitna started working as a math teacher at Lincoln High School in his hometown of Tacoma, Washington . Keeping active: Kitna, 41, didn't leave the sport though as he coached the school's football team . Kitna will earn $53,000 for Sunday's game and all of it is going to Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Washington. That amount is just shy of the salary of a teacher in the area, as $57,650 is the average annual take home pay for a teacher at a Tacoma public high school. Kitna is a father of four and his eldest son Jordan was unable to play for his father's team last year because they technically lived outside of the school district.","Jon Kitna, 41, was a back up quarterback for the Cowboys for two years before retiring in January 2012 .

Festive: Nigella Lawson, pictured on one of her Christmas-themed television shows, did not prepare mince pies or Yule logs and 'only made a Christmas pudding once', the Grillo sisters claim . Nigella Lawson relied on caterers, hired a team to decorate her Christmas tree and never cooked festive foods such as mince pies, her former assistants have claimed. Francesca and sister Elisabetta Grillo have said festivities in the chef's household were a far cry from the celebrations she portrays on screen. The sisters make the extraordinary claims a week after they were cleared of a Â£695,000 credit card fraud against their former employers. The Grillos say the chef only cooked a Christmas pudding once and they never saw her prepare mince pies or Yule logs. They claim Nigella had a tree delivered and her team were asked to decorate it. They added the chef occasionally hired caterers and, for the past few years, the family went to her husband's gallery for their meal on December 25. Speaking to The Sun, Francesca Grillo, 35, said: 'I never saw her make a mince pie or a Yule log at home. 'Caterers sometimes came in to do the cooking, then in the last few years the family ate out.' The sisters, who worked for the family between 2001 and 2012, said the atmosphere in the household was often tense and December was 'very stressful'. The sisters added Nigella would wear tracksuits and 'an old granny dressing gown' while walking around the house. Speaking with reporter Ryan Parry from The Sun, they added: 'Remember she was just a brand. Real life was different.' Nigella herself does not claim to maintain a 'goddess' image behind closed doors . Speaking to Louise Gannon for the Mail On Sundayâs Event Magazine, she said: âI happen to be incredibly lucky because Iâm in a position where I do a job I love and Iâm asked to do something like this. âIf I wasnât working Iâd be lying on a sofa in some awful clothes reading a book doing absolutely nothing. I wouldnât even put a brush through my hair. I am actually intrinsically a terribly lazy person.' Claims: The sisters say Nigella would hire in caterers, have a team decorate her Christmas tree and the family would eat their festive dinner at her former husband's gallery . Ready: The chef posted this picture of a large festive table on her Twitter profile last night . Preparations: Nigella also tweeted pictures of her gravy as well as updating her followers of her Christmas dinner preparations . Last night, Nigella tweeted a picture of a large table adored in a red table cloth with the words 'Now it feels like Christmas!' She is thought to be hosting for 30 people this year. A spokesman for Nigella said they were not commenting on the claims. Last week, the Grillo sisters were cleared of fraud at Isleworth Crown Court. Yesterday, Nigella's sister Dominic Lawson slammed any suggestion the TV chef had a bad character, saying he was 'full of admiration' while watching his sister in court. 'As I sat a few feet away from my sister during this ordeal, I was overwhelmed with admiration', he said. During the sisters' trial, it was revealed that Saatchi did not like Nigella hosting dinner parties for her friends. Extraordinary claims: Nigella's former assistants Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo arriving at Isleworth Crown Court during the case earlier this month . It is claimed the advertising tycoon didnât like her friends, or the riotous kitchen suppers which she had been in the habit of throwing when she was married to John Diamond. It has been reported the hosting ban was a cause of contention between the couple, and that eventually Nigella resented not being able to see her crowd. Creature of habit: Saatchi owned 12 identical suits, which he wore everyday and made a series of bizarre demands, the sisters said yesterday . According to Nigella, Saatchi disliked them, calling them âNigellaâs covenâ. Saatchi is also renowned for his bizarre eating habits. In 2008, he shed 5st in nine months by eating nothing but eggs, three for each meal, always hard-boiled or scrambled. In . the following years he shunned his wifeâs food and only ever ate fish, steamed or grilled, with no oil. Yesterday, some of Saatchi's more unusual living habits and requests were revealed by the Grillo sisters. They said that Saatchi owned 12 identical Â£1,000 Paul Smith suits which he would wear every day teamed with a white shirt from Turnbull & Asser. They said Saatchi would demand his two favourite drinks - cloudy lemonade and Starbucks Frappuccinos - were always in good supply at their Â£27million Chelsea mansion. He even demanded the assistants buy 12 television controls so he would never be without a remote, they claim. Nigella has said she is concentrating on work in order to move on from the past, 'extremely difficult', months. Speaking to Event Magazine she said: âThe past months have been extremely difficult but I am looking forward to getting back to work and to looking after my family. 'I will survive this and move forward. I just want to focus on my family life and work.â Answering questions about her new TV show The Taste, a cross between The X Factor and The Voice, Ms Lawson, 53, admits: âIâm a woman obsessed with foodâ.â.â. I have an instinctive urge to feed people. âNo one, not even the man who comes to fix the boiler, can leave my house without something wrapped in tinfoil.

According to the person who took the picture, the man had drunk some alcohol before squeezing himself in to the seat. He was released without charge after being freed. A McDonaldâs spokesperson, who was quoted in The Metro, said: âMcDonaldâs is aware of the incident involving a customer who decided to sit in one of our childrenâs high-chairs in Winthrop Street. âAs you can see, we recommend that children donât use the high-chair without adult supervision.'","Firefighters had to pry open the bars of a McDonald's gate in order to free a 3-year-old girl .

Couple: Prince Harry and his girlfriend Cressida Bonas may now celebrate New Year's Eve separately after spending Christmas apart while he was at Sandringham with his family . But sources said the pair, who have been dating for around 19 months, will be reunited in time for the new year. In the run up to Christmas, the prince and his girlfriend spent the weekend together at Sir Richard Branson's mansion in Kidlington, Oxfordshire. They stayed as guests of the tycoon's son Sam, 28, and his wife Isabella Calthorpe, 33, who is Cressida's half-sister, the Daily Express reported.

A woman claims she saw Gary Glitter - seen on Jim'll Fix It in 1991 - having sex with an underage girl in host Jimmy Savile's dressing room . Gary Glitter raped a girl of 13 in Sir Jimmy Savileâs BBC dressing room, it was claimed last night. The attack in the 1970s allegedly took place as Savile was himself groping a 14-year-old in the same room. A third star â a household-name entertainer who still performs â was also abusing a schoolgirl, according to the claims. They were made by Karin Ward, a former pupil of the Surrey school where Savile is accused of preying on under-age girls. She waived her anonymity to tell an ITV documentary screened last night how the Jimâll Fix It star was in cahoots with pop paedophile Glitter. Her devastating story was aired as: . Mrs Ward said her abuse happened when, aged 14, she and two fellow pupils of Duncroft boarding school for âintelligent, emotionally disturbed girlsâ in Surrey were invited to London by Savile. She told ITV News the three vulnerable girls were taken to Savileâs dressing room at BBC Television Centre. She recalled: âI saw Gary Glitter have sex with a girl in Jimmy Savileâs dressing room...in that little alcove bit. I didnât see it completely but thatâs what was going on and nobody batted an eyelid. âJimmy Savile had a [14-year-old] girl on his lap and he had his hand up her skirt. The girl Gary Glitter was having sex with also came from Duncroft. I think she might have been not quite 14.â Scroll down for video . Alleged victim: Karin ward, pictured, spoke to former detective Mark Williams for the ITV documentary . She said the third star â a well-known entertainerÂ  â tried to grope her. âIt frightened me and freaked me out,â said Mrs Ward. âHe humiliated me in front of everyone in the dressing room by saying something really unkind about my lack of breasts.â Her testimony comes after more than ten other women stepped forward earlier in the week to allege the Top of the Pops presenter abused them when they were children. Savile, who died aged 84 last October, was never charged even though at least five police forces have been investigating claims against him. Yesterday Glitter â real name Paul Gadd â said âgo awayâ when asked about the allegations at his flat in Central London. Asked if âhad sex with a girlâ in Savileâs dressing room, he said: âAbsolutely no. Thank you and goodbye.â At the home of the third star, there was no answer yesterday, but he fiercely denied Mrs Wardâs claims via his agent. Glitter was jailed for four months in 1999 for downloading images of children being abused. In 2008 he was jailed in Vietnam for assaulting two girls aged ten and 11. Savile later defended him by saying Glitter just watched a few âdodgy filmsâ for his âown gratificationâ. The BBC has been forced to launch an inquiry in conjunction with police into Savileâs alleged four-decade reign of abuse. Karin Ward claims she saw Gary Glitter having sex with a girl of 'not quite 14' in Sir Jimmy Savile's dressing room at BBC Television Centre . Jimmy Savile, left, and Gary Glitter, right, are seen on the set of Jim'll Fix It in 1991 . A memorial outside the former home of . Jimmy Savile was yesterday attacked by vandals who scrawled 'paedophile' and 'rapist' across the golden plaque. Residents . of Wessex Court in Scarborough threatened to pull down the 'bling' plaque themselves to stop the building being targeted. One said: 'Some people wanted to take a sledge hammer to it when all this blew up.' The Scarborough Civic Society plaque records in gold lettering that Savile 'entertainer and philanthropist' lived here. He is said to have exploited his BBC fame to molest and rape children as young as nine, confident that his star status at the corporation made him âuntouchableâ. A Newsnight report into Savileâs alleged crimes was controversially shelved, and last night Mrs Ward â who initially gave her story of abuse to BBC reporters â said she was appalled at the way she was treated, being informed by a brief text message that the programme was not going ahead. She said the corporation should have at least âgone to the policeâ with the information, although it is understood she herself had not reported it either. Last night a Newsnight spokesman said: âWe believed the allegation being made about Mr Glitter was already known to the police. âWe are sorry for any disappointment felt by Karin and other contributors by not broadcasting their stories. Ultimately the BBC decided it could not reach the standard of proof required for our investigation so the film was not finished and not broadcast. For example, we could not identify or trace Gary Glitterâs alleged victim.â Yesterday it was claimed Savile molested girls as young as nine during charity visits to the Haut de la Garenne childrenâs home in Jersey where abuse was rife during the 1970s and 1980s. A woman who used to live in the home and was 11 at the time told how the star abused her and her nine-year-old sister in 1971.

The failure of the Probation Service to reform hardened criminals was exposed last night in official figures. More than 200,000 offences including burglary and robbery were committed last year by criminals who had previously been under probation supervision. Chris Grayling said the figures exposed the 'merry-go-round' of crime and pledged to improve rehabilitation of offenders. The Justice Secretary is expected to announce radical plans within days which would see private companies and charities taking over probation services. More than 200,000 offences were committed by criminals who had already gone through the system . It is expected that firms will be given cash incentives if they are able to help criminals turn their lives away from crime. Mr Grayling said: 'These figures just go to show the depressing merry-go-round of crime and re-offending. Reoffending rates have barely changed in a decade, and it's clear we need to do things differently. 'I'm going to be setting out soon the Government's plans for how we intend to do just that, by better rehabilitating offenders so that they don't just carry on committing crimes and leaving more victims in their wake .' Chris Grayling during a visit to Pentonville Prison. The Justice Secretary  has condemned the figures . In the year to September 2012, some 208,699 crimes were carried out by criminals who had previously been supervised by the Probation Service. The offences included 69,000 violent crimes, 4,300 robberies and more than 20,000 burglaries. They also committed more than 10,000 sex crimes, and 45,000 theft offences. Currently probation officers handle all offenders after their release on licence who have served a year or more in jail. Mr Grayling is set to extend this to those serving less than a year. The Probation Officers' union, Napo, has condemned the plan, which will see large swathes of its work outsourced. It says it will lead to the effective demise of the 105-year-old service. It also argues the moves could pose a risk to public safety. Serious violent and sexual offenders and those who pose the highest risk to the public will remain under control of the State. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think tank said: 'By the time criminals go to prison they've usually committed a string of serious offences. So it's no surprise the probation service is failing to wave a magic wand and completely change hardened criminals.' 'What does work is tougher sentencing. Too many politicians are unwilling to consider longer prison terms but they protect the public for longer and have much lower reoffending rates.'","208,699 of offences last year by criminals previously in the system .

The 13-year-old became well acquainted with needles, after donating bone marrow twice to two of her sick brothers. It all started in 2008 when doctors found a swollen lymph node on then 2-year-old brother Will's neck. At first he was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma, a rare cancer of the lymphatic system. But doctors were confounded when exactly one year later older brother John, then 6, was diagnosed with the same form of cancer. A sister's sacrifice: When she was in the second grade, Julia Jenkins donated bone marrow to two of her brothers who were suffering from a rare genetic disorder . Since Burkitt's doesn't run in families, doctors at Aflac Cancer Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta started looking for another diagnosis. First signs: Brother Will was the first to get sick in 2008, and the then 2-year-old was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma . A specialist remembered hearing about a rare genetic immune disorder called XLP that causes the same symptoms. Will and John tested positive for the disease, in addition to their 2-year-old brother Matthew. Mother Christy Jenkins was told that all three of her sons might need a bone marrow transplant just to survive. That's when big sister Julia stepped up to the plate and got tested to see if she was a match for the donation. 'I remember getting my blood tested, like sticking a needle in my arm,' Julia told My Fox Atlanta. Turns . out, she was a perfect match for both John and Matthew. At the time, . she was too young to really understand what donating bone marrow would . entail, but she didn't think twice about doing it. 'I said yes, because they're my brothers,' she said. So . when she was just in the second grade, doctors at Cincinnati Children's . Hospital put her to sleep and gathered bone marrow from her hip bone to . give to her little brothers. The . first time Matthew's body resisted her cells so a year later she did . the same thing again, this time sitting still for eight hours while stem . cells were filtered out of her blood. Second diagnosis: But when another brother got sick, doctors discovered that all three of the boys had XLP - a rare genetic disorder . Second time's a charm: Julia had her blood tested and found she was a perfect donor for John and Matthew. Matthew's immune system resisted her first donation so she donated again . Three . years later, all three of her brothers are healthy (a woman in Texas . donated for Will). They receive weekly injections to boost their b-cell . count but other than that, they're strong enough to rough house with . each other. Julia . says if she had to do it again, she would and now she wouldn't be . scared because seeing her brothers healthy is more important trumps any . fear of needles. 'It's like a good feeling, because they're alive because of you,' Julia said. More important things: After her two donations, now 13-year-old Julia (right) says she isn't afraid of needles anymore . Life saver: Today, all three of her brothers are healthy and only need weekly immune boosts to stay that way .","Brothers John, Will and Matthew Jenkins were all diagnosed with XLP, a rare genetic immune disorder .

A father and son died trying out new diving equipment they received as presents for Christmas while attempting to descend into a cave that's been described as the 'Grand Canyon' and 'Mount Everest' of diving. Brooksville, Florida native Darrin Spivey, 35, and his 15-year-old sonÂ  Dillon Sanchez arrived at the Chassahowitzka Wildlife Refuge around 11am Christmas morning to dive into the 300-foot Eagles Nest Sink. But Spivey's fiancee Holly King started to worry when the two didn't return and she couldn't get through to Spivey on his cell phone. Christmas day tragedy: Darren Spivey, 35 (left), and his 15-year-old son Dillon Sanchez (right) died on Wednesday while trying out new diving equipment they got as Christmas presents in Weeki Wachi, Florida . Recovery divers found the tragic pair 67 and another 127 feet below the surface . Warning: A sign by the Chassahowitzka River which warns of the dangers of diving in the area . She finally drove out there herself and found their car was still parked in the lot. At that point, around 7:30 she called police. Recovery divers started searching the waters an hour later and found both bodies in the main cavern area between 11pm and midnight. They found the boy's body at 67 feet and his father's at a further 127 feet. 'It was very unfortunate. Our hearts and prayers go out to the family and friends,' Assistant Hernando County Fire Chief Kevin Carroll told the Tampa Bay Tribune. Down below: Father and son were attempting a cave dive into the 300-foot-feep Eagles Nest Sink . Incredibly dangerous: The Eagles Nest Sink in the Chassahowitzka River is described as 'one of the top three extreme dives in the world' While deputies described Spivey as an experienced diver, he was not a cave diver. His high-schooler son, they say, was not a certified diver. On the approach to Eagles Nest Sink, there are warning signs that tell just how dangerous the diving there is. Diving site Aquaviews.net has named the Floirida cave as 'one of the top three extreme dives in the world'. Gruesome underwater discovery: Spivey's fiancee Holly King noticed something was wrong when the two didn't come home by 3pm. Recovery divers found their bodies later that night . 'Only for highly experienced cave divers and the technically sound, the descent of Eagle's nest is similar to that of a chimney and hundreds of feet below it opens up into a large cavern called ""the Main Ballroom"", beyond which are longer tunnels and crannies that go even deeper,' the website said.

If you've ever spotted your waiter making odd gestures with their hands, they could be telling colleagues you're a VIP, a messy eater or be banning you from ever eating at the restaurant again. Top restaurants are now teaching their staff to use a secret hand code to talk about their customers without them knowing. The Washington Post noticed the phenomenon and spoke to Adam Sanders, manager of BLT Steak in Washington, who revealed his restaurant is often full of high-profile guests so staff make a sideways peace sign if a VIP comes in that needs special attention. Scroll down for video... If a waiter makes this signal, they are telling other staff a VIP has arrived and will need special attention . But they also have a series of . signals just for ordering drinks - a flat hand swipe for still water or . wiggling fingers like a 'jellyfish' for sparkling water - as well as . requesting the wine list or that a table be cleared. Mr . Sanders says this shaves seconds, or sometimes even minutes off the . time it takes to serve people, making the dining experience more . pleasurable. The most important aspect is still that the customer remains unaware of the gestures so it appears good service is effortless. In . the interview with the Washington Post, he said: 'Computers can only do . so much as they're stationary, service is happening at the table. Help: But if a waiter makes a signal as though they are about to take an oath, they need assistance from other staff members . A hand gesture to look like the letter 'C' means the chef needs to be asked a question from a customer . 'Shaving off seconds and minutes you can communicate better with the guests. It enhances the experience and that's what we're here for.' But guests enjoying cocktails in the dining room at CityZen in the Mandarin Oriental hotel won't be asked if they want another round if restaurant director Michael Chesser touches the side of the gas candle on their table. And if a waiter at Eleven Madison Park in Manhattan starts brushing his shoulder as a guest leaves, that signals they were a messy eater and the table needs to be cleared quickly. Alex Susskind, an associate professor of food and beverage at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., tells his students the value of staff using signals to improve a customer's dining experience. He said: 'You canÃ¢â¬â¢t yell across the dining room, ""Hey, I need help delivering food!"" 'The service experience is perishable. It begins and ends quickly. What happens at the table can make or break it.' Hand codes in the restaurant trade have been around for some time. Back in the 1940s, the owner of New York's legendary Stork Club, Sherman Billingsley, would clasp his hands together and put one thumb up if a customer needed to be removed and banned for life. Many restaurants use signals for a lot of their service - even to order drinks from the bar .","Top restaurants around the world teach their staff the hand gestures .

Whether they be Republicans, Democrats of independents, most Americans today believe the 113th Congress has been the worst in history. A new poll conducted by CNN and ORC International also found that an even larger three-quarters of Americans believe this Congress has done nothing to address the country's problems. 'That sentiment exists among all demographic and political subgroups. Men, women, rich, poor, young, old - all think this year's Congress has been the worst they can remember,' CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. 'Older Americans - who have lived through more congresses - hold more negative views of the 113th Congress than younger Americans. Republicans, Democrats and independents also agree that this has been the worst session of Congress in their lifetimes.' The 113th Congress is on track to be the least productive in the last four decades. Above, Congress meets to count the Electoral College in January 2009 . While Congress did recently pass a budget to ensure the government won't shut down in the next two years, it has passed less than 60 bills into law. Since next year is an election year, their rate of legislation is unlikely to escalate which means there's a very good chance this will be the least productive Congress in the last four decades. And after that, Americans aren't really hoping for better. Both Republican and Democratic voters expressed their opinion in the poll that legislators on the other side of the aisle will move the country in the wrong direction. Steps forward: Republican Congressman Paul Ryan and Democratic Congresswoman Patty Murray were recently able to collaborate on a budget deal . Fifty-four per cent of Americans said that about Democrats, compared to the 54 per cent that said it about Republicans. An equalÂ  54 per cent said the same thing about President Obama. The poll was conducted between December 16 and 19, and involved phone interviews with 1,036 adults across the U.S.","A new poll by CNN found that two-thirds of Americans believe this is the worst Congress ever .

Sick patients should email their GP instead of going to see them, a leading health official said yesterday. NHS Confederation boss Mike Farrar stunned MPs by saying that contacting GPs online instead of in person would reduce the pressures on hospital casualty units. His astonishing suggestion came after MPs demanded to know how NHS bosses planned to solve the âstate of crisisâ in A&E departments, which are struggling to cope with a huge surge in patient numbers. MPs were told that part of the intolerable pressure A&E units were under was in part because GPs' surgeries were shut by 5pm and on . weekends. Leading health official: NHS Confederation boss Mike Farrar stunned MPs by saying that contacting GPs online instead of in person would reduce the pressures on hospital casualty units . Patients will minor ailments unable to reach their GP during out-of-hour periods were filling up emergency departments . unnecessarily, the Royal College of Physicians said. And Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will accuse GPs of abdicating their responsibility for out-of-hours services in a major speech. Chaos in out-of-hours care and the botched launch of the Governmentâs 111 non-emergency number have pushed many hospitals to breaking point. Yesterday it emerged that senior doctors at 20 A&E units have written to the Government to say the care they are providing is âfrequently unsafeâ as a result of âtoxic overcrowdingâ. Mr Farrar admitted many units were âon a cliff edgeâ. He told the Commons health select committee that the answer was to discourage patients from going to see their GP in the first place. He said giving patients âimmediate accessâ to their doctor by email or telephone had been shown in pilot schemes to cut A&E attendances by 20 per cent. Patients would email their GP with a brief description of their symptoms or with any queries regarding medication. The doctor would then assess the urgency of their case and if necessary, encourage them to come to the surgery or visit them at home. The Department of Health has been carrying out a pilot of this system for two years, with 90 practices thought to be taking part. Concerns: Yesterday it emerged that senior doctors at 20 A&E units have written to the Government to say the care they are providing is 'frequently unsafe' as a result of 'toxic overcrowding' (file picture) Dr Patrick Cadigan, of the Royal College of Physicians, said A&E units were suffering because they were open when GPs surgeries are shut. âWe need to face up to the fact that the services other than A&E departments are run on a nine-to-five elective basis,â he said. 'We need to face up to the fact that the services other than A&E departments are run on a nine-to-five elective basis' Dr Patrick Cadigan, Royal College of Physicians . âPatients will go where the lights are on. In many of these alternatives the lights are not on after five oâclock in the evening or until weekends. But MPs said they were âseriously concernedâ about Mr Farrarâs proposals. Labourâs Valerie Vaz said: âThe average patient wouldnât know what to say or what to ask. This idea that you just ring up a doctor and tell them about your symptoms â I thought medicine was based on observation.â The number of patients admitted to A&E has increased by a quarter of a million in the past year, with reports of elderly patients waiting 24 hours on trolleys. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has blamed the problem on GPs giving up responsibility for patients out of hours and allowing care to be provided by unreliable private firms. On the rise: The number of patients admitted to A&E has increased by a quarter of a million in the past year, with reports of elderly patients waiting 24 hours on trolleys . In a major speech tomorrow, he plans to say that Labourâs âhistoric mistakeâ in agreeing to the contracts had led to the scandal of out-of-hours services where patients are told to âspeak to a doctor who doesnât know you from Adamâ. But critics say the disastrous launch of the non-emergency 111 service earlier this year has increased the pressures on A&E. 'The average patient wouldnât know what to say or what to ask. This idea that you just ring up a doctor and tell them about your symptoms â I thought medicine was based on observation' Valerie Vaz, Labour MP . Its poorly trained staff sent hundreds of patients to hospitals unnecessarily â with some given ambulances for flu symptoms. Others felt they had no choice but to go to hospital after their calls to the 111 service were unanswered. In a letter leaked to The Independent, 20 senior A&E doctors have warned that the crisis is so severe that doctors can no longer guarantee safe care for patients. A combination of âtoxic overcrowdingâ and âinstitutional exhaustionâ is putting lives at risk, according to the letter, written to senior NHS managers from the leaders of 18 emergency departments in the West Midlands. They warn that the rising number of patients presenting themselves for treatment has created a âstate of crisisâ in casualty departments. The letter read: âWhat is entirely unacceptable is the delivery of unsafe care, but that is now the prospect we find ourselves facing on too frequent a basis. Going online: Mr Farrar said giving patients 'immediate access' to their doctor by email or telephone had been shown in pilot schemes to cut A&E attendances by 20 per cent . âNurses and doctors are forced to deliver care in corridors and inappropriate areas within the emergency department, routinely sacrificing patient privacy and dignity and frequently operating at the absolute margins of clinical safety.â Dr Mike Clancy, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, said the crisis was so serious, it will take â20 yearsâ to solve. When asked about the problems by MPs, Mr Farrar, whose organisation represents NHS managers, quoted research from Patient Access, which represents 40 GP practices in England. He said two or three practices in Leicester and the East Midlands â where patients spoke to GPs over the phone rather than seeing them â had the lowest A&E admissions. Under the system, patients phone the surgery in office hours hoping to make an appointment but are instead told by a receptionist that a doctor will call them back. Usually they receive a phone-call from a doctor within 30 minutes to discuss their symptoms and ifÂ  necessary are told to come into the surgery. Mr Farrar said: âTheyâve reduced the number of patients who get face-to-face consultations and donât seem to get any detrimental outcomes. âThe evidence seems to be that patients like it and there is no deterioration in their care.â Mr Farrar added: 'The schemes that I highlighted to the Health Select Committee have broadly had a positive impact for the patients that have used them. 'We do need to look at how we reduce the numbers of people visiting A&E, and part of this means helping people access the right services. 'Where cases are not an emergency and patients do not need to visit hospital, the NHS should be helping people stay in their own homes and access quality care and expert advice. 'Schemes like this are all about giving patients choice about allowing them to decide how they receive their care, using technology to help enhance the services that we provide. 'This is by no means the only solution to the problems we face. But we need do need to look at a range of options and take urgent action to avoid pressures crippling the system.'","Suggestion by NHS Confederation boss Mike Farrar has stunned MPs .

"By . Michael Zennie . PUBLISHED: . 10:22 EST, 7 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:42 EST, 7 November 2012 . Voters in Colorado and Washington state legalized the recreational use of marijuana Tuesday night, and before anti-drug advocates had time to complain, the movement already gained a celebrity endorsement. Actor Seth Rogen posted an enthusiastic message to Twitter shortly after the law was announced: 'I'm moving to Colorado.' Rogen's positivity about the law, which places the drug nearly on par with alcohol and cigarettes, comes as little surprise as he has been outspoken about his drug use. Pot friendly: Seth Rogen has starred in a number of 'stoner' comedies and spoken out about his marijuana use . Fan from out of state: Rogen currently lives in California . The actor has starred in a number of stoner comedies, most notably Pineapple Express and Knocked Up. 'It's funny because I'm from Vancouver where its just much more culturally accepted, even coming to America it was shocking to me and after getting detained by the police a couple times I realized how much more seriously it's viewed,' he said in a previous interview. The change in legislation shows that Rogen's lax attitude towards the drug is being upheld in at least two states in the U.S. now, as residents of both Colorado and Washington will soon be able to walk into dispensaries and purchase up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use -- no prescription required. Users only have to prove they are at least 21. Fifteen other states and the District of Columbia have approved marijuana for medical use, but it requires a doctor's prescription and certification that it will be used to treat a chronic health condition. The ballot measures in the two western states defy the federal government, which still views marijuana as a controlled substance. It is unknown how the Obama Administration will handle the state laws -- which are still superseded by the federal prohibition. Celebration: Supporters of Amendment 64, which legalizes marijuana use in Colorado, celebrated their victory last nigth . The Justice Department could potentially sue the states and block the laws entirely. Federal officials have stayed silent on the issue during the election, though they have taken only small steps to crack down on state-sanctioned dispensaries and growers in places like California . 'Federal law still . says marijuana is an illegal drug, so don't break out the Cheetos or . gold fish too quickly,' Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper, a . Democrat who opposed legalization, warned supporters celebrating their victory. Passed: Three states had the legalization of recreational marijuana on their ballots, measures that would set up a direct challenge to federal drug law . Opponents say legalizing marijuana will result in more abuse of the drug by children, as well as increased numbers of impaired who get behind the wheel under the influence. In Washington, Initiative 502 passed by a massive 10-pount margin, 55 percent to 45 percent. It allows adults over age 21 to buy up to an ounce of marijuana from heavily-taxed state-run drug dispensaries. Supporters poured money into the campaign, raising more than $6million, some which is spent on TV ads. Colorado's Amendment 64 passed 53 to 47 percent. Colorado residents over age 21 will be able to purchase up an one ounce of the drug from heavily-regulated, privately-run retail stores. It's also legal to grow up to six marijuana plants. Voters in Oregon rejected a marijuana-legalization bill that was even more liberal than those proposed in Washington and Colorado. It trailed by 10 percentage points and was roundly rejected in most counties last night. Massachusetts voters approved the medical use of marijuana last night, though voters in Arkansas rejected a similar measure. 'Today the state of Washington looked at . 70 years of marijuana prohibition and said it's time for a new . approach,' said Alison Holcomb, manager of the campaign that won passage . of Initiative 502 in Washington. Since California first legalized medical marijuana use in 1996, states across the country have begun to follow suit. The votes last night make Washington and Colorado the only states to legalize use of the drug without a prescription. Here is a list of places that currently allow medical marijuana use, an the year the laws were enacted. The marijuana measures in Colorado . and Washington will likely pose a headache for the U.S. Justice . Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which consider pot . an illegal drug. The DOJ has declined to say how it would respond if the measures were approved. Colorado's Amendment 64 will allow . adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce of marijuana, though using the . drug publicly would be banned. The amendment would allow people to grow . up to six marijuana plants in a private, secure area. Washington's measure establishes a . system of state-licensed marijuana growers, processors and stores, where . adults can buy up to an ounce. It also establishes a standard blood . test limit for driving under the influence. The Washington measure was notable . for its sponsors and supporters, who ranged from public health experts . and wealthy high-tech executives to two former top Justice Department's . officials in Seattle, U.S. Attorneys John McKay and Kate Pflaumer. 'Marijuana policy reform remains an . issue where the people lead and the politicians follow,' said Ethan . Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance, which opposes the co-called 'war . on drugs.' 'But Washington state shows that many politicians are . beginning to catch up.' Estimates show pot taxes could bring . in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but the sales won't start . until state officials make rules to govern the legal marijuana industry. The Washington measure was opposed by . Derek Franklin, president of the Washington Association for Substance . Abuse and Violence Prevention. 'Legalizing is going to increase . marijuana use among kids and really create a mess with the federal . government,' Franklin said. 'It's a bit of a tragedy for the state.' Historic: Colorado and Washington are blazing trails for greater acceptance of the drug -- though the federal government say marijuana is a controlled substance . The marijuana referendums in Colorado and Washington make the drug legal to possess -- but also heavily regulate its sale. Here are a few details about the laws. In Colorado: . In Washington: . The federal angle: .","Measures allow adults over age 21 to buy up to an ounce of marijuana from heavily-regulated stores .

Adam Lanza hated his volunteer-teacher mother because he believed she loved her first-grade students more than him, police reports released yesterday revealed. Lanza's mother Nancy volunteered at Sandy Hook Elementary SchoolÂ  from 1998 to 2012 and according to one unidentified witness, her mentally-disturbed son was jealous of her students. 'Lanza apparently felt that his mother loved the students more than him,' the witness said. The new account was revealed yesterday, as state police released their final report on the shooting investigation - amounting to thousands of pages of reports, crime scene photographs of the school and Lanza home as well 911 calls and chilling video. The report also revealed the extent of Lanza's medical illness with several witnesses speaking of an early fascination with destruction and violence. Scroll down for video . Jealous: One witness told police that Adam Lanza hated his mother since he believed she loved her students at Sandy Hook more than him. The new account was released in the Connecticut State Police's final report on the massacre. Above, Nancy Lanza (left) and son Adam (right) The final police report on the Sandy Hook school shooting revealed a photograph of an unknown boy as a baby dressed in camouflage gear and gnawing on a gun . In cold blood: Lanza killed his mother while she slept in her bed on the morning of December 14, 2012. Above, a rifle lying on the floor of a bedroom in their Connecticut home . Rampage: After shooting his mother, Lanza drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School where he proceeded to kill 6 staff and 20 first-grade students . A thank you card and Stepping Up Ceremony pamphlet for Sandy Hook School were found in Nancy Lanza's home. She had volunteered at the school when her son was a pupil there . The report traced the weeks leading up to the shooting, when Adam seemed to become more and more unhinged. Two weeks before the shooting, . Mrs Lanza confessed to a friend that her son was becoming . increasingly despondent and had was put 'over the edge' when their house . lost power during Hurricane Sandy. Another friend told . investigators that Mrs Lanza texted him a few days before the shooting . to say her son had bumped his head and they were 'dealing with blood'. The day before the shooting she had . stayed two days at a New Hampshire hotel as part of an experiment in . letting her son stay home alone and be independent. She . was shot four times in the head by her son the morning after she . returned. The rifle used to kill her was found by police next to her . bed. Lanza then went to the . Sandy Hook Elementary school where he shot dead 20 first-graders and six . educators with a semi-automatic rifle on December 14, 2012, before . shooting himself. Among other disturbing elements of evidence to be revealed from a summary report last month, was the fact that in the fifth grade, Lanza wrote The Big Book of Granny, in which the main character has a gun in her cane and shoots people, and another character talks of liking to hurt people, especially children. The book was among items seized from Lanza's home, but there was no indication he ever handed in the book at school. One of Lanza's former teachers told investigators that when asked to do creative writing at school he would write disturbing accounts. 'Adam would write ten pages, obsessing over battles, destruction and war,' the teacher said, according to the report. His work was 'so graphic that it could not be shared.' Lanza was also obsessed with the 1999 shooting at Columbine High in Colorado and other mass killings, the report said. The report also said that in 2005, Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger's disorder - an autism-like condition that is not associated with violence - and that he lacked empathy for others and behaved strangely. A box of family photos was included in the stacks of evidence . A bedroom from the home of Nancy Lanza and her son Adam in Newtown, Connecticut . A bed frame without the mattress with women's shoes lined up underneath at the Lanza home. The gunman shot his mother Nancy Lanza dead at the Connecticut home as she lay in bed . Bullet-hole riddled target practice sheets found inside the Lanza home . Nobody was allowed into his room, not . even to clean, according to the report. It said Lanza also disliked . birthdays, Christmas and holidays and did not like to have his hair cut. He . also wouldn't touch doorknobs, his food had to be arranged on the plate . in a certain way, and he changed clothes often during the day. He was a loner at school and was repelled by crowds and loud noises. Prosecutors issued a summary of the investigation last month that portrayed Lanza as obsessed with mass murders but the report concluded that Lanza's motives for the massacre might never be known. Lanza 'was undoubtedly afflicted with mental health problems; yet despite a fascination with mass shootings and firearms, he displayed no aggressive or threatening tendencies', it said. His mother had said during a lunch . with friends just before the shooting that she never 'felt in any . personal danger living with Adam'. During . the lunch she had said she was planning on leaving Newtown, and . continuing to care for Lanza, perhaps in North Carolina or Washington . state. Books about dealing . with autism were found at the family's home and a nurse who met Lanza . four times in 2006 and 2007 had prescribed him anti-anxiety medication. The . nurse said in her police interview that Lanza had been diagnosed with . obsessive compulsive disorder and was 'emotionally paralyzed', changing . his socks 20 times a day. Despite this his mother had stopped giving him the medication and failed to schedule follow up visits. A photo released by the Connecticut State Police shows what the evidence report describes as a view of a second floor bathroom and its contents including a photo identification of Adam Lanza and a cellular phone with battery removed . Old newspaper clippings and a copy of Amish Grace, about a 2006 school shooting, was also found in the Lanza home . Books about Asperger syndrome, which Lanza had, were found in one of the bedrooms of the family home . Pictures believed to have been drawn by Lanza were also found in the family home. Another interesting piece of evidence was a birthday card send to Adam by his father, Peter, which read: 'Adam, Happy Birthday - Send me an email when you want to go hiking or shooting. Love, Dad.' Other photos and files showed that police found a stock of knives at the home and instruction manuals for the guns. In one chilling image, a wooden bed frame sits without the mattress above a row of women's shoes. It is known that Lanza shot dead his mother Nancy Lanza while she lay in bed before taking off on his rampage at the school. Investigators reported that the windows of his second-floor room had been taped over with black trash bags. One of the drawings found inside Adam Lanza's home .

A millionaire Tory MP has infuriated his neighbours with plans to build an enormous solar farm on his sprawling estate. Richard Drax was last night facing claims of hypocrisy after proposals to put scores of solar panels on 174 acres of his land were submitted to planners. Local residents in Dorset point out that three months ago Mr Drax attacked plans to increase subsidies for wind turbines and solar panels. He also led opposition to a proposed wind farm off the Dorset coast. But the Harrow-educated politician now wants to build a solar farm the size ofÂ  110 football pitches on his 7,000-acreÂ  Charborough Estate. Leading the fight against the SouthÂ  Dorset MPâs plans is Sir Michael Butler, a retired Foreign Office civil servant, who says he has already defeated a previous proposal for a wind farm on the same site. Sir Michael, 86, is among more than 300 people who have written to the planning authority about the solar project. He told the Mail: âIf this plan was to go ahead it would be an absolute disaster. âThis is a most beautiful part of theÂ  British countryside and they want to stick this abomination in the middle of it.â Tony Pollard, 85, who is retired from the RAF, added: âThereâs been a lot of chuntering about all this. âBearing . in mind [Mr Draxâs] previous comments ...Â  in which he seemed to be . opposed to subsidies for wind and solar farms there are those who might . consider him something of a hypocrite.â Family seat: Solar panels are planned for 174 acres of the sprawling Charborough Estate in Dorset . Mr Drax, 55 â full name Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax â has said the opinion of the local community was sought before the application was submitted âand will continue to be incorporatedâ. He said the site is well screened and will be planted with a âwildflower-rich grass swardâ. AÂ  community fund would also be established to benefit the area. He declined to answer questions from the Mail on how much income he would receive from the solar farm or to address claims that he is a hypocrite for backing the scheme. Under fire: Angry locals have tried to block the plans . A statement on his behalf said: âThe Charborough Estate is working with renewable energy provider Good Energy in considering the suitability of field-scale solar energy projects on land which it owns. âThere is a strong and increasing need for additional sources of renewable energy. â . A spokesman for Good Energy said: âThe project will play an important role in improving the UKâs energy security, as well as reducing its carbon emissions.â Solar power was supported financially by the Government to encourage its growth, he said. âThere is no direct subsidy paid to Mr Drax related to this project,â added the spokesman. âGood Energy has an agreement to lease the land from the estate and pay rent accordingly.â","Richard Drax has made plans to cover his 7,000-acre estate in solar panels .

An undercover investigation has revealed a shocking trade in illegal 'bush meat' at a London market - including the sale of dead rats for human consumption. Charred sheep skins, another favourite in west Africa known as 'smokies', are also being sold by butchers at the Ridley Road market in Dalson, east London. A BBC investigation using hidden cameras uncovered at least six butchers selling the illegal meats, breaking UK food safety laws. Appetising? This grab from the BBC's secret filming during . their investigation purports to show a Ridley Road Market trader selling . illegal cane rat meat . Illicit trade: The animals are not cleared for human consumption in the UK and it is feared they may be contaminated . The show will air this evening and will horrify many who have been buying meat from these stalls and shops, with experts warning the food chain could be contaminated. West African and environmental health sources said the market was known for illicit meat. But . a Freedom of Information request to Hackney council revealed that the . last time its enforcement officers visited traders about illegal meat . was in 2009. Paul . Povey, a member of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, . said: 'I am just so shocked. It's all illegal and hasn't undergone . health control, hasnât been inspected and may well be contaminated.' Denials: When confronted by BBC journalists, all those filmed secretly denied selling the illicit meat . Bush meat: Cane rats and 'shocking' quantities of illegal and 'potentially unsafe' meat have been sold to the public in east London, a BBC London undercover investigation has found . The . butchers were filmed preparing to sell smokies, which are made by using . a blow torch on the skin of a sheep or goat to give it a charred . flavour. Confronted with the evidence gathered by the BBC, . Islam Halal Meat, Punjab Halal Meat and Fish, and Dalston Butchers denied . they were selling illegal meat. The practice is outlawed under UK and European food laws for reasons of public safety and animal welfare. Dr . Yunes Ramadan Teinaz, a chartered environmental health practitioner, . said: 'Behind the illicit trade in smokies are criminals who donât . observe the law and are just after financial gain. 'It is disgusting and outrageous that the local authorities donât take action and remove this meat from the human food chain.' Shocking: Butchers at Ridley Road Market in Dalston were filmed selling illegal 'bush meats' - including rats . One Hackney butcher sold a researcher some of the illicit meat and said: 'Donât tell anyone, otherwise there will be trouble.' Two African food stores were selling the grasscutter rats, described as having been imported from Ghana. There is no suggestion that every butcher in Ridley Road was prepared to deal in illegal meat. The . manager of food store Great Expectations, which allegedly sold two . Ghanaian rats, said: 'I donât sell rats, I never sell rats, I donât sell . rats. I donât have any rats, why you come to video me?' The . manager of Adom TradingÂ  also denied selling bush meat. 'What you are . saying is a lie, a 100 per cent lie, I donât sell rats,' she said. Accused: Dalston Butchers was one of the shops accused of selling the meat - but they denied it . Sting: BBC undercover reporters filmed various stores selling the foo, which breaks UK food safety rules . Councillor Feryal Demirci, Hackney Councilâs Cabinet Member for Safer Neighbourhoods said: 'Hackney Councilâs team of Environmental Health Officers make regular visits and inspections of over 1,000 businesses across the borough, including those on Ridley Road.

Two young cheetahs at the Smithsonian National Zoo attacked and killed a deer that jumped into their enclosure on Friday, and it might not be the last since getting into the zoo is an easy feat for the wild animals that can clear fences more than 12 feet high. Just a week before the deadly incident, another deer was spotted by park visitor Megan Dombi-Leis. The 30-year-old Edgewater, Maryland resident was looking into the elephant enclosure when she saw an out-of-place deer and snapped its picture. Too easy: Just a week before two cheetahs killed a white-tailed deer that got into their enclosure at the National Zoo, another deer was pictured in the elephant enclosure . She says the elephants weren't out at the time, so they went to see the giant beasts in their indoor enclosure. Soon . after, the elephants were released outside and by the time they went . back to the place where the deer was spotted, it was gone. Zoo officials told MailOnline that no witnesses were around when the white-tailed deer got into the cheetah enclosure last Friday. There is a live stream available of the cheetah enclosure online, but the spokesman said it wasn't positioned where the attack took place. A zookeeper finally found the deer after hearing noises coming from the cheetah enclosure. Brother and sister cheetahs Justin and Carmelita were found next to the already dead deer's carcass. Doctors will examine the deer to make sure it didn't have any diseases. Zoo officials told the Associated press that the attack was a 'normal and expected reaction'. Natural instinct: Sibling cheetahs Justin and Carmelita (pictured at three-months-old in 2012) have spent all their lives in captivity but still knew what to do when a deer jumped into their enclosure on Friday - kill it . According to the zoo spokesman, the cheetah enclosure is designed in a bowl-like fashion with a fence on the rim making it impossible for the cheetahs to escape since they're not good jumpers. White-tailed deer however, can clear heights of up to 12 feet high. The cheetah enclosure is protected from the top of the bowl by a 12-foot fence, a moat and live wires, but the deer was still able to make its way over the fence and down into the pen. But even for a deer, it would have been nearly impossible to escape since the tall fence was at the top of the enclosure. Stay away from the zoo: A similar incident happened in November 2009 at an adjacent zoo when a deer got into a lion enclosure. Above, the entrance to the National Zoo . Justin and Carmelita have been at the zoo for a little more than a year and a half. The . two were born through a risky cesarean section in April 2012 that ended . up saving both the cubs' and mother's lives. The cubs were treated for . several days in intensive care after their birth. Three months later, the cheetah cubs made their debut at the zoo but had yet to be named. The . zoo partnered with USA Track & Field in the days leading up to the . 2012 Olympic Games and decided to name the brother and sister after the . two American runners who placed highest in the 100-meter dash. Justin Gatlin took home the bronze medal in the the race, and Carmelita Jeter won the silver medal.","A white-tailed deer found its way into a cheetah enclosure at the National Zoo on Friday .

Dangerous paedophile: Mark Sleman, of Exeter, Devon, was jailed for nine years in 1994 for the kidnap and attempted rape of a ten-year-old girl . A dangerous paedophile who was released from prison early has gone on the run for a second time after absconding from his accommodation. Mark Sleman, 42, of Exeter, Devon, was sent to prison for nine years in 1994 for the kidnap and attempted rape of a ten-year-old girl. The English Defence League supporter, who has a personality disorder, was let out of prison early - but sent back to jail after breaching his licence terms by going on the run to visit a nightclub. Then in 2008 Sleman was jailed for seven years for robbing a homeless man, but he was again released early - and again went on the run. Now, the mother of the girl attacked by Sleman almost 20 years ago has spoken out to blast the probation service for being ânot fit for purposeâ. The 52-year-old woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, told The Daily Telegraph: âIt just beggars belief that Sleman has been allowed to go on the run again. âSurely after he breached the terms of his licence the first time he should never have been given another opportunity. (My daughter) is terrified that he is going to come looking for her or that he will attack another little girl.â Sleman - who has been in prison for almost half of his life - attempted to rape the girl, a vicarâs daughter, after kidnapping her from a vicarage and tying her up in a caravan in 1994. In 2010, ahead of his most recent release, Sleman claimed in a newspaper article that he reoffended when he was released on licence because he received insufficient support. Proposal: Justice minister Chris Grayling has suggested a law change that would ensure child rapists must serve their full sentence before getting out of jail . Current rules state anyone serving a quantified sentence of more than a year must be released on licence from jail halfway through, reported The Daily Telegraph. But justice minister Chris Grayling has suggested a law change that would ensure child rapists must serve their full sentence before leaving prison. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: âSerious offenders on licence who live in Approved Premises are subject to strict licence conditions and are carefully supervised by specially trained staff. âThey must follow a structured regime, which includes an overnight curfew and can be recalled to prison if they breach them.'","Mark Sleman, 42, was jailed in 1994 for kidnap and attempted rape of girl .

Harry Carl Mapps was apprehended Saturday in a late-night raid at the motel room where he was staying in Roland, Oklahoma - 700 miles from the home in Rye, Colorado, where he allegedly killed three friends. The . bodies of 51-year-old Reginald Tuttle, his wife, 55-year-old Kim .

Bloody and bruised: Harry Mapps was busted by U.S. Marshals after a late-night raid at the Oklahoma motel where he was staying . Far and wide: Harry Mapps was found in Roland, Oklahoma, 700 miles from the home where he allegedly killed a family of three . Police said he shot Mr and Mrs Tuttle in the head and then strangled their daughter, a mother of four, before burning the house down to conceal the evidence. Mapps, a 59-year-old former long-haul trucker, was a friend of Mr Tuttle and had been staying with him, authorities said. U.S. Marshals tracked him to a motel after launching a nationwide manhunt. He has been charged with arson and three counts of first-degree murder. Roderick lived in nearby Pueblo with her husband and four children and was visiting her parents at the time of the shootings. Victims: Kim Tuttle (far right), her husband Reginald (second right), and their 33-year-old daughter, Dawn (far left), were shot dead November 27 .

He said Mapps' last known location was the town of La Junta in southeastern Colorado, where authorities said he cashed a check made out to one of the victims. An earlier warrant for Mapps' arrest listed charges of theft, identity theft and forgery, all related to the alleged check theft. Happier times: Kim and Reginald, seen here on their wedding day more than three decades ago, are survived by their son . Mapps was a friend of Mrs Tuttle and worked for his trucking business; his wife was a baker . Slain daughter: Dawn Roderick, a married mother of four, was visiting her parents at the time of the shooting . Authorities identified Mapps as a suspect in the deaths three days after the fire, but the murder and arson charges were not announced until Thursday. Taylor said the warrants took time to process. âThe new charges will make him one of the most sought-after fugitives in the country,â the sheriff said. âLaw-enforcement agencies nationwide will not want a triple-homicide suspect on the streets.â The warrant is sealed and no details have been released.

A federal fugitive arrest warrant has also been issued for Mapps, U.S. Marshal John Kammerzell said. Mapps was initially described as a handyman. His estranged wife, Sandy Mapps, told The Denver Post she ordered him to leave their home in Dimmitt, Texas, last spring. He quit a farm labor job in Texas and moved to Colorado, she said. Mrs Mapps has been using her Facebook page to spread the message about her husbandâs manhunt, posting regular updates on the progress of the investigation.

The 'prolonged squeeze' on workers' wages must come to an end as the economy continues to strengthen, a business leader has demanded. John Cridland, director general of the CBI lobby group, said recovery is taking hold and businesses have a 'spring in their step' compared with a year ago. This is in stark contrast to the mood of hard-working families, who continue to earn around Â£1,350-a-year less in real terms than when David Cameron became Prime Minister in May 2010. Decline: When adjusted for inflation, average earnings have fallen from just over Â£500-a-week when David Cameron became Prime Minister in May 2010, to just over Â£480-a-week in May 2013. In his new year message, Mr Cridland said: 'Businesses must support employees in every part of the country to move up the career ladder, while also giving a helping hand to young people taking their first tentative steps into the world of work.' He added: 'As the financial situation of many firms begins to turn a corner, one of the biggest challenges facing businesses is to deliver growth that will mean better pay and more opportunities for all their employees after a prolonged squeeze.' Growth: John Cridland said recovery is taking hold and businesses have a 'spring in their step' compared with a year ago . Mr Cridland said it was positive news that jobs were being created, adding it was shaping up to be a full-time recovery with the majority of new jobs being permanent. His statement comes as the GMB union warned that the real value of national average earnings has fallen by 14% since the start of the recession in 2008. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average national wage in 2008 was Â£26,137, compared with Â£27,174 today. When adjusted for inflation and the rising cost of living, that amounted to a 13.8% fall in real terms. Mr Cridland said that for the first time . since the start of the recession, 2014 will see most firms increasing . the size of their workforce, boosting their graduate intake and the . number of apprentices they take on. 'The good news is that wages will pick up . in the year ahead as growth beds down and productivity improves...But . there are still far too many people stuck in minimum wage jobs without . routes to progression, and thatâs a serious challenge that businesses . and the Government must address.' Mr Cridland spoke of the importance of . skills, calling for a Ucas-equivalent vocational system to help raise . awareness and parity of esteem for alternative routes to higher skills. 'If . 2013 was the year that business trust took a hammering on a range of . issues from corporate taxation to energy prices, then 2014 must be the . year that business leaders take action to rebuild that trust,' he said.

This is the terrifying moment a teen robber holds up a shop at gunpoint - all for 24 cans of beer. George Banister, 19, pulled the weapon on the horrified shop keeper in the West End of Newcastle. He then threatened to shoot shopkeeper Mohammed Rafiq, who bravely chased the teen out of his shop. Robbery: George Banister, 19, is caught on camera holding up a Newcastle shop for the sake of a few cans of beer . The thug later posted a picture of himself posing in a mask and holding the gun on Facebook. Banister was a known offender in the area and admitted robbery and a series of other assaults at Newcastle Crown Court. He was jailed for 6 years. Sending him to a young offender . institution, Judge Brian Forster QC told him: 'You pulled an imitation . weapon and threatened to shoot the shop owner and you later boasted . about it on Facebook. 'The courts have to protect local shopkeepers and deter people from behaving in the way you behaved. 'You answer for terrifying repeated acts of violence and you show no regard for other members of the community.' The court heard how Banister and another 17-year-old went into Fenham Discount Store about 5pm on August 9. The youth then stole a pack of 24 cans of lager and left the shop, moments before Banister came in pointing a gun at the shopkeeper. Despite chasing the raider out of his shop, he was unable to get the stolen beer back. Two . hours after the robbery Banister was bragging on Facebook about having . committed it, wearing a mask and posing with the BB gun he used in the . raid. Jailed: Career criminal Banister was jailed for six years after he admitted robbery and a series of other assaults . Caroline McGuirk, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant threatened to shoot the shop owner, who nevertheless pursued him. 'Mr . Rafiq said he was very scared when the weapon was pointed at him but he . felt he couldnât let them get away with it so he chased them. 'He says the incident has caused him a lot of stress, harassment and fear.' This is not the only of Banister's shocking crimes. Last January Banister assaulted Abigail Pollard, who hours later tragically hanged herself. Abigail had been fighting with another woman outside Switch bar, in Newcastle, when Banister waded in, attacking both. He punched the other woman in the face twice then dragged Abigail across the road and kicked and stamped on her head. Miss . McGuirk said: 'Later that day she hanged herself. She visited a place . where a family member had committed suicide a year before and, using the . same tree, she hanged herself. 'There is no direct evidence to say this assault contributed but it canât have helped her state of mind.' In July Banister got involved in another fight between two women on Adair Avenue, Benwell. He racially abused one of the women, spat at her and punched her in the head. When the other woman asked who he thought he was, Banister replied: 'Iâm George Banister, you have some ammonia', and threw the burning substance in her face. Banister was involved in more city centre violence in December last year when he and another attacked several men in an unprovoked attack outside Sinnerâs Bar. And while under arrest at North Tyneside police station, Banister bit a detention officerâs hand. Banister, of no fixed address, who already had 39 previous convictions, admitted robbery, possessing an imitation firearm, six assaults and racially aggravated assault.

'No experience': The manager of Horny Escorts managed to get an advert for willing women onto a government website . A job as a Â£10-an-hour prostitute was advertised on a government website. Officials at the Department for Work and Pensions mistakenly allowed the post on Direct Gov. The cheeky manager of Horny Escorts tried his luck with a posting for female call girls. The advert, which was uploaded on the Universal Jobmatch section of the website, read: âFemale worker wanted to go out with guys maybe for evening or have full on sex. The only qualification for the job - for which applicants would need 'no experience' - was that successful candidates 'must like sex'. In grammatically incorrect English, the advert continued: 'This would be better if you was single and be able to work at your own pace. Looks and race unimportant. You will need a mobile phone.' There was even an option for users of the popular jobseekers board to select a from a drop-down menu to 'tell us why you don't wish to apply for this job'. The advert was posted by the boss of the agency last Monday. The agency boasts of having 'the most gorgeous and sophisticated women and men in the UK.' The manager said: 'I put the advert up there because itâs a job site and itâs a job. I was a bit shocked they allowed it. 'I also do deliveries and I had posted an ad for a same-day delivery service and then I just put the escorting one underneath it. 'The advert says ""must like sex"" because if a man pays for it obviously heâs going to want that. 'I thought the Department of Works and Pensions would admin it. I didnât know it would go straight online.' The manager said he decided to advertise after business slowed down, saying: 'Itâs not been that good.' Job site: The ad was uploaded to the Universal Jobmatch section of Direct Gov . A DWP spokesman admitted the blunder but refused to say if adverts were read before they were posted on the website . He said: 'The post was inappropriate and was taken down next day. 'When advertising jobs, employers have to agree to terms and conditions. Where an inappropriate job is identified it is quickly removed.' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has led a crusade to crack unemployment by insisting the jobless should have to work unpaid or be stripped of their benefits. Earlier this year, a Welsh government website offering career advice was taken down after telling entrepreneurs how to earn a fortune in the sex industry. Business Wales gave tips on how to make up to Â£48,000 as a stripper and how to run an escort agency, a lap dancing club or an erotic boutique. The website, launched to help stimulate the economy, suggested aspiring actors strip to earn extra income or become an escort which pays between Â£120-Â£250 an hour. It was taken down in July after critics complained it was degrading to women and could lure 'potentially vulnerable young people.'","Department for Work and Pensions officials mistakenly allowed the post .

"Almost 50,000 women in UK and 400,000 worldwide affected by PIP scandal . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:46 EST, 29 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:13 EST, 30 December 2013 . A new national register will log every breast implant operation in England to prevent a repeat of the scandal in which thousands of women received faulty implants, ministers have said. Tough marketing controls will also be introduced in the new year, with a ban on offering breast implants as competition prizes, time-limited offers, and so-called âmother and daughter dealsâ for multiple patients. The Government has accepted most recommendations made in a review by Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, after theÂ  disclosure that French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) made implants from industrial silicone. Nearly 50,000 women were affected after having faulty breast implants inserted, with many having them removed again as they ruptured more frequently (pictured) Almost 50,000 women in the UK and some 400,000 worldwide were affected by the scandal, which came to light two years ago when doctors found many implants were rupturing. Poor record-keeping by some private clinics meant that often women were unable to find out if they had the faulty implants. In future the implant a woman is given will be recorded in the new register, in the way hip and knee operations are already logged. Training will be improved, with the Royal College of Surgeons establishing new standards for cosmetic surgery. Surgeons will be required to have professional indemnity to protect clients. Ministers are expected to announce that the registry will be piloted from next month, and formalised later in 2014. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: 'For too long, the cosmetics industry has been completely unregulated and there are too many tales of women who have been exploited and of lives ruined by rogue cosmetic firms and practitioners. Tough marketing controls will also be introduced in the new year, with a ban on offering breast implants as competition prizes, time-limited offers, and so-called 'mother and daughter deals' for multiple patients . 'This has to change, so we are taking robust action to clamp down on the cosmetic cowboys in order to properly protect women and the public. 'For the first time, there will be proper training courses for cosmetic surgeons, and we shall be setting up a breast implant registry which will better track the quality of implants and, if required, enable us to act much more quickly to protect women and patients. 'We will also be outlining rigorous plans to clamp down on irresponsible cosmetics advertising. For the cosmetic cowboys, be it on the high street, or in the operating theatre, there will be nowhere to hide.' The Governmentâs proposals were welcomed by the president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, Rajiv Grover. 'We are thoroughly relieved that the Government has seen the light in terms of the importance of reinstating the implant register - but the system must be made compulsory, otherwise it is a waste of time,' he said. 'Whilst independent consultants and many reputable groups were able to easily contact their patients during the PIP implant crisis, the scandal shone a light on shoddy record-keeping from many corners of the sector; with women being given the wrong or no information at all in regards to what had been placed within their bodies. 'A centralised and comprehensive database is well overdue and essential for the publicâs safety and peace of mind.'","New national register will log every breast implant operation in England .

He was rescued from starvation in the gutters when his plight touched the hearts of pet lovers. But after being brought to Britain from Bulgaria, former street dog Bobi now faces another battle for survival. For while one charity raised hundreds of pounds to rescue him and fund medical treatment, another â the RSPCA â has taken the three-year-old terrier away, saying he should be put down because he is too disabled. Born survivor: Three-year-old Bobi has the support of an internet petition signed by a staggering 5,000 people . Saved: The terrier was rescued from starvation in Bulgaria when his plight touched the hearts of pet lovers . Supporters of the Canine Rescue and Action Aid for Animals charities , which has been trying to rehome Bobi in the UK, have accused the RSPCA of a âbarbaricâ attitude. They claim an officer forcibly removed the dog from his new family and 5,000 pet lovers have signed a petition demanding that Bobi be spared. Bobi, whose back legs are paralysed, arrived in Britain on December 21 with the permission of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. After specialist medical treatment at a clinic in Bulgaria, vets deemed he was healthy enough to be rehomed in the UK. Donations: He arrived in the UK on December 21 after supporters raised hundreds of pounds to rescue him . Battle: Bobi, who has paralysed legs and has to wear nappies, was deemed healthy enough to be rehomed by vets. But he now faces another battle for survival as the RSPCA has taken him away and wants him put down . Bobi spent Christmas with a foster . family in the West Midlands but they struggled to cope with the demands . of a disabled dog who has to wear nappies. He . was then rehoused with Jayne Jones, an Canine Rescue manager with years of . experience caring for sick dogs, in Newport, South Wales. The RSPCA has been on the receiving end of repeated criticism in recent years over its âpolitically motivatedâ actions. The charity has pursued a number of expensive legal cases in its battle against activities such as foxhunting, leading some to suggest it has prioritised animal rights over animal welfare. It was heavily criticised last year after it was revealed to have spent Â£326,000 on legal action against David Cameronâs hunt in Oxfordshire. And despite the RSPCA relying solely on donations from the public, its boss Gavin Grant earns up to Â£160,000 a year. There have been calls to strip the charity â set up in 1824 â of its ability to bring prosecutions. Yesterday the head of the Countryside Alliance warned that the RSPCA has turned into a âsinister and nastyâ organisation. General Sir Barney White-Spunner urged his members to stop donating to it. He told the Daily Telegraph its inspectors had been given intrusive powers with no proper basis in law. He said: âWhen their inspectors turn up in uniform itâs as a private organisation. There is something rather sinister and nasty about it. âItâs a sad story. Itâs got plentyÂ  of money but its membership has plummeted. â However, on Friday after just two hours at his new home, he was taken away by an officer from the RSPCA. The . officer said she would return Bobi after some routine tests but Mrs . Jones says she received a phone call to say the dog would be put down . the following day. The . RSPCA told her a vet had decided that Bobi was not fit enough to lead a . happy life â a claim his new owner and Action Aid say is untrue. Last night, as the Save Bobi campaign gathered momentum, attracting support from around the world, the RSPCA said they would seek a second opinion from another vet before making a final decision on the dogâs fate. That failed to placate Canine Rescue, which spent Â£510 to transport Bobi from Bulgaria and more than Â£1,300 on his treatment, including vaccinations and CT scans. The charityâs founder, Michelle Jones, said last night that Bobi had been deemed fit enough by Defra to enter the country. âThat would not have been the case if he was as ill as they claim,â she said. âYou can see in a video we took just days ago that he is a lively, active and happy boy. He deserves a chance to live, especially after everything heâs gone through.â Action Aid chairman Kendra Pinder said: âThe RSPCAâs answer to everything is to kill, rather than working with the animals to make them better. 'This is the first time in the dogâs life it has been given a chance for a better life and it has now been cruelly taken away.â If the second vet decides Bobi should live, Action Aid will use funds raised through the Save Bobi campaign to buy a Â£200 doggie wheelchair and hydrotherapy, which costs about Â£35 per session. Comments by signers of the petition, on website Change.org, include claims the RSPCA is âbarbaricâ, âmilitantâ and discriminates against disabled animals. The RSPCA last night denied it had taken the decision that Bobi should be put down, saying it was on the recommendation of a vet. Support: Last night, the Save Bobi campaign gathered momentum, attracting support from across the world . âWe visited Bobi at an address in Wales on Friday after concerns had been raised with us about his welfare. We found him to be in a poor state of health and so took him to see a vet,â a spokesman said. âAs well as having disabled legs which were wrapped up in duct tape, he is incontinent, has pressure sores and possible internal injuries too. âThe first vet recommended that the kindest thing to do was to put him to sleep as he has no quality of life. On the ownerâs request we have taken him to a specialist vet of the ownerâs choosing. âAny decision about Bobiâs future will be made by vets and with Bobiâs best welfare in mind.â Michelle Jones of Canine Rescue said Bobi had only had a small amount of duct tape on his leg to hold together a bandage - as a temporary measure. It had been attached by the dog's foster carer before he arrived at Jayne Jones' home.","Bobi was rescued from starvation in the gutters of Bulgaria by pet lovers .

For decades, they haveÂ  provided a lifeline for pensioners and low-income shoppers looking to pick up second-hand goods for a snip. But charity shops have now been accused of abandoning their traditional clientele by selling used items for hundreds of pounds. Many have effectively become mini-boutiques offering cast-off designer clothes and accessories, as well as high-end art and books, at prices beyond the means of most hard-pressed consumers. Cancer Research UK are charging Â£250 for a faux-fur coat and Â£200 for an Alpaca wool coat . Shoppers have complained that some of the second-hand goods on sale cost nearly the same as buying them brand new. The rising prices come amid fears that an increase in the number of charity shops is fuelling the decline of the British high street by forcing existing retailers out. The country now has 10,000 charity shops, which enjoy generous tax breaks not available to other shopkeepers. Many of the items on sale at the weekend, while not quite as expensive as they would be new, were still priced beyond the reach of most elderly or low-income customers. Goods available at Oxfam on Londonâs Marylebone High Street included a Â£140 dusty pink Hugo Boss skirt suit and Â£100 gold Orciani belt with a large embellished buckle. At Cancer Research UK in Hampstead, North London, a brown faux-fur jacket was going for Â£250. At an Oxfam store in Cambridge a signed print by painter Sir William Russell Flint was on sale for Â£249.99. Another of the charityâs shops in the city was charging Â£20 for a Nina Ricci perfume bottle â even though it was empty. The high prices prompted complaints from shoppers out looking for bargains. In Cambridge, retired teacher Giselle Harker, 75, said: âCharity shops are far too expensive now. Things are overpriced â especially in Oxfam. I find the Salvation Army is the only good charity shop now.â Marsh Ryles, a 62-year-old quality manager from Cambridge, said: âYou canât get the bargains you used to be able to. âNow theyâll charge Â£25 for a pair of menâs Clarks shoes that have been worn. It is ridiculous.â A recent thread on parenting site Mumsnet also complained about the soaring cost of charity shops. One person commented: âThe problem is theyâre doing themselves out of business. âI think that most people consider a reasonable price for a used item of clothing/books to be around a third of what it cost new. If they overcharge, things will remain unsold and the charity makes nothing.â Despite rising prices, Oxfamâs network of nearly 700 shops has seen profits plunge by Â£17.6million in the last year amid hard times for all High Street stores. Ian Matthews, its head of retail, said: âAll our shop managers have the flexibility to set their own prices, using their judgment and some guidance, to decide what prices and products will best suit customers in their location.â","Names such as Oxfam and Cancer Research UK selling expensive items .

The Seabourn Sojourn was blocked in by Argentine port workers who want to prevent the ship sailing to the disputed islands. The vessel was later allowed to leave the port at Buenos Aires following a delay of seven hours. Union leaders were demanding that the liner's captain pledges not to visit the Falklands before being allowed to set sail. Blocked: The Seabourn Sojourn was blocked in by Argentine port workers who want to prevent the ship sailing to the disputed islands . The vessel, with 330 crew, was due to . set off yesterday at 5pm local time on a 15-day cruise around Patagonia, . visiting the Falkland Islands and ending up in Valparaiso, Chile. The company's UK marketing director Carly Perkins said there were a 'significant number' of British passengers on board but could not give a figure. She said: 'The ship has been able to resume its schedule. It was delayed but it has now left Buenos Aires.' Passengers paid between Â£4,200 and Â£9,300 each for the trip, depending on their choice of cabin. The ship was scheduled to make an eight-hour stop at the Falklands' capital Port Stanley. Passengers are offered a four-hour tour around the battlefields from the 1982 War, including Mount Tumbledown and Mount Longdon, scenes of some of the fiercest fighting. Workers from the United Maritime Workers Union (SOMU) prevented the Seabourn Sojourn from leaving the port in Buenos Aires. They had the backing of the radical Malvinas Resistance group, which demands the return of the islands, known as Las Malvinas in South America, to Argentina. Tony Lopez, spokesman for the group, said the ship would not be allowed to set sail until it had confirmed it would not sail to the archipelago, 300 miles off the coast of Argentina. He described the cruise liner as 'a pirate ship' and said the ship would be violating the . Gaucho Rivero law, designed to stop British ships from 'plundering' Argentine resources in the area. Arriving in Hong Kong: The ship's 450 passengers paid between Â£4,200 and Â£9,300 each for the trip. It boasts 225 cabins spread over eight decks, a casino and two swimming pools . The incident began a day after Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, was summed to the Foreign Office to answer allegations of harassment to British ships and shipping companies. FCO defence and intelligence director, Robert Hannigan, called the ambassador in after masked men raided the Buenos Aires offices of a company offering cruises to the Falklands on November 19. The Foreign Office described the raid as 'a violent act of intimidation'. Ms Castro, a former air stewardess, was said to have been 'very cross' at the Foreign Office for 'wasting her time'.

Stop over: The ship was scheduled to make an eight-hour stop at the Falklands' capital Port Stanley, pictured . Last April she angered Foreign Secretary William Hague by hijacking a meeting on human rights to repeatedly ask him about the Falklands dispute. The Seabourn Sojourn was launched in the River Thames in June 2010 by the model, actress and singer Twiggy. The ship, which boasts 225 cabins spread over eight decks, a casino and two swimming pools, is owned by US company Seabourn. It was not clear how many Britons were on board. A spokeswoman for the company in London was unable to give an immediate comment. In February Argentine officials refused to allow three cruise ships to dock in the southern port city of Ushuaia following a protest by war veterans. Tourism chiefs in the area accused the officials of 'economic suicide' at the time. The Gaucho Rivero law, passed last August, was named after an Argentine worker who led a 1833 mutiny against the British in the Falklands. It was only expected to be used against British military vessels and those involved in fishing and oil exploration.","The Seabourn Sojourn was blocked by Argentine port workers who want to stop the ship sailing to the islands .

Headmistress of Heathfield School Jo Heywood said appearing 'dumb' is seen as a good way to make a fortune . Reality TV shows such as The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea are infecting too many classrooms with a âculture of stupidityâ, according to a leading headmistress. Jo Heywood said Michael Goveâs education reforms are being jeopardised because appearing âdumbâ is seen as a good way to make a fortune rather than working hard. She singled out TOWIEâs Joey Essex, who cannot tell the time and is capitalising on his reputation for being dense as well as former cast member, Mark Wright, for particular criticism. Mr Wright now has his own Heart FM radio show but has previously been described as âdisastrously dimâ after comparing his jungle experience on Iâm a Celebrityâ¦ Get Me Out of Here to soldiers fighting in âAfricaâ. The headmistress of Heathfield School in Ascot, Berkshire, said she was âdeeply concerned about the dumbing down of culture in the UKâ. Childrenâs education and interest in learning face âunprecedented threats from the âculture of stupidityâ all around them', she claims in her blog to be published on the school website this week. The mother-of-three said: âAt first, reality TV may have seemed ironic â a TV experiment where we peered in at othersâ lives but now it has taken on a life of its own and some of its stars reflect the education system they have been brought up in. âSome children and teenagers see them as role models whose behaviour they wish to emulate and whose lives they wish to emulate.â Mrs Heywood, 42, described TOWIE - which Joey Essex is currently taking a break from - and Made in Chelsea as âmind-numbingly dullâ. But, worryingly, the so-called stars of the shows are âlauded for their lack of intellect and, in some cases blatant stupidity to the extreme of a âculture of stupidityâ being the normâ. She attacked âlazyâ TV executives for âcross-pollinatingâ shows, with Joey Essex appearing on Iâm A Celebrityâ¦ Get Me Out Of Here, for example. She said: âThe shows and their stars become a touchstone to their young audiences â the watercooler TV for their generation. âThey laugh along when Joey Essex tells millions he canât tell the time and revel in his ignorance. âWhat sort of message does this send to the nationâs teens, the majority of whom are within an education system which is bottoming out in the world education league â about working hard and improving their own rigour?

She said: âThe reality TV circus has come full circle because the rise of celebrity culture, the bedfellow of reality TV, has meant that our children have started to mirror some of those traits and they have become less respectful to their elders and peers. âThey canât see the benefit of working hard which is perhaps one of the biggest challenges Mr Gove faces in his battle to improve the school system. âWhile TV companies continue to make shows for the lowest common denominator to make as much money as possible, this culture of stupidity will continue to infect our classrooms. âThese stars become like friends to them â they discuss them at school and they believe they have more relevance in their lives than historical figures.â Mrs Heywood also attacked Channel Fourâs Educating Yorkshire - set in Thornhill Community Academy - for encouraging children to aspire to be reality stars. The headmistress questioned how to make it cool to be clever when [you have] the likes of Mark Wright 'who appears to be not very bright'. She went on to say that mr Wright must be a clever man as he used TOWIE as a springboard to fortune . She said: âWhere in the past this may have been a one-off documentary, this was presented as a primetime entertainment reality TV series, even with its own Christmas special. âWhile I certainly applaud some of the inspirational teachers and pupils who appeared, I do have to question whether it is morally right to make reality TV stars of the children and their teachers.â Speaking about her blog last night, Mrs Heywood said many reality TV shows are âdamagingâ the work of schools. She said: âHow do we make it cool to be clever when (you have) the likes of Mr Wright for example, who appears to be not very bright, when actually, letâs be honest, I think he is quite a clever man as heâs used this whole TOWIE as a springboard. âHe can make millions and millions and he doesnât have to stretch his brain.

A cruise around the Caribbean aboard one of the worldâs largest passenger ships carries connotations of glamour, elegance and sophistication. Unfortunately for Gail Empson and her family, the 2,500-strong gang of raucous, heavy-drinking, leather-clad bikers and their partners who were sharing their voyage had rather different ideas. From the moment the bikers stepped on board the Freedom of the Seas ship, which carries 3,600 passengers, the trip to celebrate Mrs Empsonâs 50th birthday was a disaster. Scroll down for video . Heavy impact: The Empson family's cruise aboard the Freedom of the Seas was ruined by a 2,500-strong biker gang. One of the bikers is pictured taking part in the rowdy 'belly smacker' competition . Swan dive: The gang was aboard the cruise as part of their annual 'High Seas Rally' and members were accused of wearing sexually explicit t-shirts and even having sex in the hot tub . The gang, who were on their annual âHigh Seas Rallyâ, could not have been much further removed from the usual cruiseâs sedate complement of families and retired couples. They monopolised the swimming pool areas on board, holding rowdy competitions such as âbelly smackerâ diving and a contest in which women judged topless menâs bodies by rubbing baby oil on them while blindfolded. One passenger complained of bikers wearing sexually explicit T-shirts, fighting, and even having sex in hot tubs, despite there being youngsters on board. Even on shore stops there was no escape. A visit to the beach in Haiti was spoiled when hundreds of the bikers turned up. âThey were very loud and sitting so close they could have held my hand,â said Mrs Empson. âI went back to the ship because I couldnât stand it.â On another stop the ship was over two hours late leaving port because hundreds of the bikers failed to return on time. Disgust: Gail Empson from Bristol and her two children Holly and Austin went on the cruise with Mrs Epson's husband John and four other relatives. Their week-long cruise was ruined by the rowdy bikers also on board . Rubbed up: A contest in which women judged topless men's bodies by rubbing baby oil on them while blindfolded . Oily: Cruise firm Royal Caribbean had given no warning to other families that the voyage would be largely made up of those from the biker event . Cruise firm Royal Caribbean had given no warning to other families that the voyage would be mostly taken up by the bikersâ event. Mrs Empson, a school administrator, and her auditor husband John, 42, from Bristol, went with children Holly, 12, and Austin, 13, as well as four other relatives, including Mrs Empsonâs sisters. The total cost for the group of eight was around Â£4,000, not including flights. The week-long cruise started from Port Canaveral in Florida at the end of October and included stops at several Caribbean islands. Initially the sea was choppy, due to the after-effects of Hurricane Sandy, and the family went straight to their cabin. But the next morning they discovered that it wasnât only the seas that were a little on the rough side. Sturdy: Members of the gang line up for a best beard competition in which female members judged them by smelling and touching the facial hair . Sniff: A woman judging one of the biker's beards by smelling it . Fancy dress: Women take part in the High Seas Rally 'Treasured Chest' contest . Mrs Empson said of the bikers: âWe went to sit around the pool and they quickly took over the whole area. I was very upset and just thought, âOh my God, this is horrendousâ. They were drinking heavily all day and it was just very inappropriate for children.âÂ  Some areas of the ship were cordoned off for the bikers, who even had their own shows in the evening. Mrs Empson had been looking forward to dressing formally for âfine diningâ in the restaurant and had bought several outfits. But on the first night they walked in to discover all the other diners in jeans, T-shirts and leathers. One biker said to her: âI think you are in the wrong dining room, maâam.â âWe didnât dress up at all after that,â she recalled. Excuse: The Empson family was initially told by the cruise operator that they had not been warned due to data protection and were offered Â£150 in credits for a future trip . Rowdy: Punters hold their bingo cards in the air during 'Biker Pirate Bingo' âI was absolutely disgusted by the whole thing,â said Mrs Empson. âWhen we complained about not being warned, we were given some ridiculous excuse blaming it on data protection. 'All they offered us was Â£150 in credits for a future trip.â After the Daily Mail contacted Royal Caribbean, it increased its offer to a credit for the full value of the cruise for Mr and Mrs Empson and their children, to be used for a future booking.

And one man, who had to be treated by the ship's . doctor, was told he had racked up more than Â£1,000 in medical bills. Passengers also claim they have been told that if they catch the virus it is their own fault for not being clean enough. Although cruise bosses say no staff are sick, one passenger said they found a steward vomiting in her cabin toilet. Tour: The ship was visiting Christmas markets around Europe, starting in Zeebrugge and Amsterdam before moving on to Hamburg (pictured inset), Copenhagen and Oslo then returning home to Southampton . Up to 300 passengers angry at a lack . of information about the situation congregated to demand action only to . be told by an officer that it was an illegal meeting and they should . disperse. Those on board said passengers began . to fall ill on the first day of the cruise and it quickly mushroomed . into an epidemic.

Another passenger said: 'They flew in . extra cleaners to meet the ship in Copenhagen and picked up two extra . agency nurses in Amsterdam. They have put out extra sick bags.' In May this year around 170 passengers on board luxury cruise liner the Boudicca had their dream holidays ruined by sickness. The Fred Olsen owned ship was greeted by NHS staff and ambulance crews when it docked in Scotland after a 13-day tour of the Canary Islands that was marred by a suspected norovirus outbreak. In February 3,000 passengers on board the Crown Princess had their Caribbean trip cut short when the Princess Cruise liner was ordered back to port after the vomiting bug swept through the ship. Just a week earlier two other Princess Cruise ships had been struck by the highly contagious illness, which causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Graham Hodgson, 68, a retired sales . manager from North Wales travelling with his wife Karen, said: 'All . those who fell ill were quarantined to their cabins so it felt like a . plague ship.

An 18-year-old man is accused of killing his aunt's boyfriend with a hammer before cutting off his head, ears and nose and leaving them on his aunt's bed 'as a present' on Christmas Day. Alexis Valdez has been charged with first-degree murder after Silvestre Diaz-Hernandez, 41, was found dismembered in a Chicago apartment the men shared with Valdez's aunt. Valdez allegedly called police about 2am to report the grisly crime. Scroll down for video . Grisly: Alexis Valdez, 18 (left) is accused of murdering his aunt's boyfriend, 41-year-old Silvestre Diaz-Hernandez (right) Prosecutors say Valdez had been living with the couple in the basement apartment for about six months on the condition he would go to school, work and contribute to household costs. When he failed to do that, his aunt told him he needed to move out of the North Kildare Ave apartment, angering the teen, according to the Chicago Tribune. On Christmas Eve, Valdez was allegedly home drinking while his aunt was at a party and Diaz-Hernandez was visiting family members. When Diaz-Hernandez came home to find there was no beer left in the house, he went to a nearby drugstore with Valdez. Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Kingsley Sawyers told a bond hearing that Valdez hid a hammer by the apartment's door before leaving. When the men returned home, Valdez allegedly picked up the hammer and struck Diaz-Hernandez  in the back of the head. Sawyers said the man fell and Valdez struck him up to 10 more times. Valdez then covered the windows, played loud music and began hacking the man's body with a butcher's knife. Prosecutors say Valdez then put the head, ears and nose on his aunt's bed 'as he, quote, 'Wanted to leave his aunt a present',' Sawyers said. Scene: The victim's body was found in the basement apartment of a complex at the 2500 block of North Kildare Avenue, Chicago . According to an arrest report, police who responded to the home early on Christmas Day found Valdez sitting in the front yard holding an iPad. When one officer asked, 'What's going on?' Valdez allegedly replied, 'Shouldn't you arrest me before you ask me questions?', the Chicago Tribune reported. When the officer asked why he should arrest Valdez, the teen allegedly replied: 'Because I just killed a man, and he's in the basement,' before slamming the iPad to the ground. He also allegedly told police he would have also killed his aunt if she had witnessed the attack.

However, plans to add seven more F-22s to the U.S. Air Force's fleet of 187 were in 2009 cancelled by Congress, saving $1.75billion from the defence department's budget. There have been concerns in Washington that the F-22 is too hi-tech. Congress has banned its sale overseas because it was deemed that the technology involved is too sensitive to share with other countries. Various foreign governments want to buy an F-22. Critics of the jet also argue that it is not needed any more and is a costly waste of time. Despite its undoubted power, it has not seen any action in Iraq or Afghanistan. The official price tag is $153million, but factor in research, development and maintenance costs and gthat figure could double.

"By . Christopher Leake . UPDATED: . 20:01 EST, 21 January 2012 . A man who has worked on two of the worldâs most luxurious cruise liners is being investigated by police over allegations he indecently assaulted child passengers. It is claimed the crew member carried out the sexual assaults over the past five years on Cunardâs flagship the Queen Mary 2 and its sister vessel Queen Elizabeth. Over that period, the ships have been packed with tens of thousands of British families enjoying luxury voyages across the Atlantic, Caribbean, Mediterranean and the Baltic. Luxury: Trips on the 151,000-ton Queen Mary 2 (above), which was launched in 2004, can cost up to Â£120,000 . Prestigious: The Â£400million Queen Elizabeth, launched in late 2010, charges as much as Â£5,000 for a 13-night Mediterranean cruise . Detectives started the investigation after a tip-off thought to be from the parents of one of the children involved, all of whom live in the UK. Police in Wiltshire, where the unnamed man lives, have contacted parents in various parts of the UK whom they want to interview. Cunard â part of the Carnival cruise company that owns the sunken Italian ship Costa Concordia â has also asked the childrenâsÂ  charity, the NSPCC, to speak toÂ  worried parents who may require counselling and advice. Nobody has been arrested or charged over the allegations. Inside the QM2: The cavernous Britannia restaurant which can seat 1,347 guests in two sittings . Another world: The QM2 even had its own planetarium . But police sources confirmed to The Mail on Sunday last night that the ex-cruise worker â who left the company before the police probe began six months ago â has been interviewed by Wiltshire CID. Detectives are understood to have examined photographic and computer equipment at the manâs home. The investigation, which began last summer, has taken so long because of the delicate nature of the allegations and the fact they involve young children. Cunard bosses, headed by theÂ  companyâs president and managing director Peter Shanks, have launched their own inquiry into the allegations, which officials said had âdeeply shockedâ them. Inside the Queen Elizabeth: The main lobby with its elegant staircases . Treated like royalty: The Queen Elizabeth boasts its own theatre . Company managers are understood to be reviewing Cunardâs strict vetting procedures, which are carried out on every applicant and include criminal-record checks. Cunard refused to say what role the former cruise worker hadÂ  carried out on its ships, but he is known to have been a low-ranking employee who had regular, close contact with passengers on board. The 151,000-ton Queen Mary 2, which entered service in 2004 and is as long as 41 double-decker buses, employs 1,253 crew and accommodates 2,620 passengers. Passengers pay between Â£1,200 and nearly Â£4,000 a head for a seven-day transatlantic cruise from Southampton to New York. Round-the-world trips are available with a top price of about Â£120,000. Stars who have travelled on the QM2 include The Whoâs Roger Daltrey, Dame Shirley Bassey, John Cleese, Carrie Fisher and JaneÂ  Seymour. Right royal approval: Both vessels were launched to great fanfare by The Queen . Queen Elizabeth, the newest of the Cunard fleet, launched in late 2010, is much smaller than the QM2, at 90,900 tons. It can take 2,068 passengers and has 1,005 crew. The Elizabeth boasts luxury cabins and ornate lounges. The cost of a 13-night Mediterranean cruise, excluding return flights, is between Â£1,700 and Â£5,000, depending on the grade of cabin required. Famous passengers on the Queen Elizabeth have included Sir David Frost. Both the Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mary 2 were launched in a blaze of publicity by the Queen but the man under investigation has never met her, according to Cunard. A Wiltshire Police spokeswoman said last night: âWe can confirm we are investigating historical allegations of child abuse by an employee of Cunard cruise liners. Inquiries continue. The employee no longer works for the company.â A Cunard spokesman said: âWe are deeply shocked by these allegations as the safety and wellbeing of our customers is of paramount importance to us. âA thorough police investigation is under way which we are supporting and co-operating with fully.â","Police tipped off by parents of one of the alleged victims .

Paul Trotter, 34, pleaded guilty to a string of sexual assaults and taking, making and possessing indecent images of children . A cruise ship worker who filmed himself . abusing children left in his care aboard luxury Cunard liners has admitted attacks on 13 youngsters. Paul Trotter, 34, pleaded guilty to a string of sexual assaults and taking, making and possessing indecent images of children, most of whom were under the age of 13 at the time. The supervisor, who worked in the play zones, made films of himself abusing the children on three cruise ships, including Queen Mary 2 and its sister vessel Queen Elizabeth. He also possessed other indecent images of children he had obtained online. In a statement Cunard, part of the Carnival Corporation group and owners of the Costa Concordia which ran aground earlier this year, said it was 'deeply shocked' by Trotter's 'appalling crimes'. It added he had avoided detection despite a number of safeguards, including having had his criminal record checked. Trotter, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, appeared at Swindon Crown Court, dressed in a suit and purple tie. He admitted 12 counts of sexual assaulting a child under the age of 13, one count of sexual activity with a child under the age of 13, five counts of taking indecent images of a child, five of making indecent images of a child and one of possessing indecent images of a child. The offences were committed from November 2007 to August 2011 when he arrested by Wiltshire Police's child abuse investigation unit. Judge Douglas Field told Trotter, who was living in Wiltshire at the time of his arrest, said he would be held in custody to return before the same court on May 11 for sentencing. He also ordered him to sign the sexual offences register before he was taken back to prison. The supervisor made films of himself abusing the children on three cruise ships, including Queen Mary 2 (pictured) and its sister vessel Queen Elizabeth . Speaking outside court, Cunard president and managing director Peter Shanks said: 'We were first made aware of these serious allegations eight months ago by Wiltshire Police and were deeply shocked by what we were told. 'Since then Cunard has provided full support and cooperation to the criminal investigation, and where possible within the constraints of the legal system, to the families involved. 'Our own feelings of shock are secondary to those of the families directly impacted. Offences also took place on the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship. Cunard said it had asked the NSPCC to audit its policies and procedures . 'As a parent myself I can clearly understand the emotional pain and anguish they have suffered and endured since they were contacted by the police investigating this case. 'From the outset, every family impacted by these appalling crimes has had our support, and by partnering with the NSPCC, guidance and help from the experts in the field of child welfare has been offered and accepted. 'Paul Trotter was able to avoid . detection despite all of our youth staff, including Mr Trotter, having . had their criminal records checked. We have closed circuit TV on board . all of our ships, including all of the children's clubs, and our own . rules dictate that a minimum of two members of staff are to be with . children at all times. 'Our . safeguards were strict but sadly did not stop this one individual from . managing to circumvent the system and manipulate those around him. Peter Shanks, managing director of Cunard, made a statement outside Swindon Crown Court and said the company has been deeply shocked by the case . 'We are now working with the NSPCC and have already identified changes in three key areas for improvement.' The cruise ship company added it had asked the NSPCC to audit its policies and procedures. As a result, it has changed its recruitment process, introduced new training and improved on board supervision of the youth centres. Mr Shanks added: 'We will do everything in our power to put in place every possible safeguard for children.' Nicki Davey from Wiltshire Police said a great deal of work went into identifying the children from the films so parents could be informed . Wiltshire Police spokeswoman Nicki Davey said: 'In August 2011, Wiltshire's child abuse investigation unit received intelligence which highlighted that Paul Trotter, a Wiltshire resident at the time, was in possession of indecent images of children. 'The contents of his computer were examined and revealed that he had filmed himself abusing children in his care. 'Many of these films were made on board three cruise ships operated by Cunard, where Trotter was employed in the children's play zone area. He also possessed other indecent images of children obtained online. 'With the co-operation of Cunard, a great deal of work went into identifying the children to allow us to inform their parents. 'Wiltshire's child abuse investigation unit has fully supported parents throughout this investigation with the assistance of the NSPCC. 'Paul Trotter worked in a position of trust with children. He has abused the trust placed in him by the children and their parents. 'His admission of the charges will mean that the families do not have to experience the distress of a trial. We would like to acknowledge their co-operation and understanding following our visits to them.' John Grounds, director of the NSPCC's child protection consultancy, said: 'While nothing will ever excuse Paul Trotter's crimes, his guilty pleas are welcome as this should save his young victims having to re-live their ordeals while giving evidence in court at a later full hearing. 'In the meantime, the NSPCC is working closely with Cunard to help improve its child protection policies and procedures and will be presenting its recommendations very shortly. 'From the outset, Cunard have taken a proactive approach to address any issues arising from this case and we look forward to a continuing relationship with them.' The 151,000-ton Queen Mary 2, which entered service in 2004 and is as long as 41 double-decker buses, employs 1,253 crew and accommodates 2,620 passengers. Passengers pay between Â£1,200 and nearly Â£4,000 a head for a seven-day transatlantic cruise from Southampton to New York. Round-the-world trips are available with a top price of about Â£120,000. Queen Elizabeth, the newest of the Cunard fleet, launched in late 2010, is much smaller than the QM2, at 90,900 tons. It can take 2,068 passengers and has 1,005 crew and would cost between Â£1,700 pounds and Â£5,000 pounds for a 13 day cruise of the Mediterranean.","Paul Trotter possessed other indecent images of children he'd found online .

Ray, 56, plays Elzevir in Sky1âs Moonfleet, a two-part adaptation of John Meade Falknerâs tale of smuggling and adventure in the 18th century. Here Ray, star of movies such as Scum and The Sweeney, takes us behind the scenes on the drama, filmed on location in Ireland. Top dog: Ray Winstone swaps Rooney for robbery in Sky One's new smuggling drama, Moonfleet . MONDAYMuch of the drama in the first part of Moonfleet revolves around the battle between Elzevir and Mohune, played by Ben Chaplin, a magistrate determined to stamp out Elzevirâs smuggling in the Dorset village where the story is set. The scene weâre filming today involves quite a lot of running as Elzevir and his sidekick John Trenchard, played by Aneurin Barnard, attempt to escape the law. Iâm not getting any younger, but Iâm determined to carry on doing action sequences for as long as I can. Iâve earned my pint of Guinness at the end of the dayâ¦ TUESDAYToday weâre at Coral Strand beach in Galway for a scene where John is emerging from the ocean, dripping wet and starkers. Weâre all highly amused to find a busload of American tourists arriving to see this particularly beautiful beach, just as Aneurin leaves the sea totally naked! Heâs a brave boy is Aneurin and he carries on regardless, finishing the scene like a pro. Once weâve finished chuckling, thereâs time to admire this spectacular coast which is like the Amalfi Coast in Italy â only colder. There are seals here too â what a fantastic place! Fire! Winstone's Elzevir teaches John Trenchard (Aneurin Barnard) how to work a flintlock pistol . Loveable rogue: Ray Winstone has made playing villains with a heart such as Elzevir into an art form . WEDNESDAY . Today Elzevir is teaching John how to fire a flintlock pistol [right]. Thereâs quite a lot of shooting with flintlocks in Moonfleet, and theyâre quite tricky to handle, so weâve had lessons. Iâm not bad but the miracles of the editing process may make Elzevir look a bit more proficient than I actually am...THURSDAYIn the second part of Moonfleet, Elzevir and John take to the high seas in pursuit of Blackbeardâs fabled diamond. We donât actually get on board a ship â but it certainly feels like it! A large section of a sailing ship has been constructed and put on hydraulics in the car park of the old John Player cigarette factory in Dublin, where weâre being bombarded with gallons of water. Itâs the nearest thing to being in a tempest without actually being at sea and itâs hard graft!

Unlucky day: Barnard appears to be feeling the cold during his Colin Firth style beach scene in Moonfleet .

A seven-year-old boy who suffered a severe allergic reaction to his medication has developed a rare condition which caused his skin to shed. Oakley Orange was diagnosed with epilepsy and given medication to help manage his condition. But 12 days after taking the tablets, the youngster started to complain of a headache and cold and developed a rash. Oakley Orange, 11, was diagnosed with epilepsy and given medication to help manage his condition. But he has since suffered a severe allergic reaction to it - and the allergy has caused his skin to shed . Then his entire body burst into blisters before his hair and finger and toenails fell out - leaving him looking he had been burnt alive. The bizarre condition is known as Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS), which causes the cells in skin to die before shedding - rather like a snake's. The severe reaction caused Oakley to lose 100 per cent of his skin and is causing damage to his internal organs. The youngster has been on life-support machines and sedated for three weeks to allow his body to recover. But his distraught parents Lorraine, 45 and Steven, 43, have been warned by doctors that his chance of survival is just 65 per cent. Mrs Orange, from Strood, Kent, has lobbied the drugs company to include a warning on medication. She said: 'It is the most horrific thing for a parent to have to see their child suffer in the way Oakley has. You feel so helpless. The severe reaction caused Oakley to lose 100 per cent of his skin and is causing damage to his internal organs. He has also lost his hair and nails and is 'in agony', says his mother . 'It has been the worst thing I could ever describe, devastating. He is in agony - and usually he is such a happy little boy. 'He loves playing on his Xbox and riding his bike and his scooter. Now he canât even open his eyes. 'Everybody who meets him falls in love with him. I know Iâm biased because Iâm his mum, but Oakley is the sort of little boy that, when you meet him, you donât forget him. 'On Friday we thought we had lost him when his temperature plummeted and he was diagnosed with hypothermia but the doctors have been able to warm him up. After Friday I think he can fight anything. 'Each day it is something else, we donât know what is going to happen, one hour to the next. 'The condition is affecting all his major organs. One day he could be fine and then it will affect something else. The doctors will treat that, and then it will affect something else.' She added: 'We need to raise awareness about the side effects of this drug and make sure it has a warning on the label. In America the drug carries a warning so it should do here, too. Oakley's mother Lorraine said: 'It is the most horrific thing for a parent to have to see their child suffer in the way Oakley has. You feel so helpless' 'I want to educate as many people as I can about SJS. This can happen with any medication, not just what Oakley was taking. 'You need to read the leaflet and make . sure your child is not sensitive to anything. I wouldnât want anybody . else to go through what we have been through. I just need my little boy . back.' Oakley was diagnosed with epilepsy last month and prescribed drug carbamazepine. Mrs Orange said the side effects listed on the packaging only said 'can cause a rash'. He fell ill at school on December 3 and developed a rash on his chest two days later. Doctors first diagnosed him with a virus and then measles before a dermatologist identified the rare condition. He has gradually became covered in blisters the size of golf balls before the whole top layer of his skin shed. Since then he has been wrapped in bandages head to toe to protect his delicate skin and given strong painkillers and sedated to help dull the agonising pain. The family has received support from celebrities including TV presenter Coleen Nolan and singer Peter Andre . Oakley has the most severe form of . SJSÂ  and the swelling has affected his internal organs, so he is on a . ventilator to help him breathe. He also has a related condition called . toxic epidermal necrolysis. SJS affects just three in one million people and is usually triggered . by an adverse reaction to medication. The mortality rate is around 15 . per cent. Victims develop terrible scarring all over their bodies . and well as severe conjunctivitis which can lead to blindness and mouth . infections which can stop them eating. Oakley was prescribed epilepsy drug Carbamazepine, which is sold as TegretolÂ® and manufactured by Novartis. The . drugs company today said Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and . Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) are listed on the summary of product . characteristics. A Novartis spokeswoman said: 'Novartis is . committed to patient safety and strictly complies with local and . international regulations and pharmacovigilance guidelines. 'For all its products, Novartis evaluates and reviews its global safety database on an ongoing basis.' She . added: 'The decision to prescribe Carbamazepine is between an . appropriately qualified healthcare professional and the patient or . appropriate caregiver.'

An artificial heart which could extend a patientâs life by five years has been successfully implanted for the first time. Doctors operated on a man of 75 on Wednesday night and he is said to be recovering well. Although doctors have been attempting to transplant artificial hearts into patients since the 1980s, the devices have so far only worked for a few months. The artificial heart weighs 2lb Â¿ three times as much as a real organ Â¿ and is powered by the same type of rechargeable batteries used in toys, watches and smart phones . The pioneering operation, which took place at the Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris, offers hope to the 100,000 critically-ill patients in Europe and the U.S. in need of a new heart. The device weighs 2lb (0.9kg) â three times as much as a real organ â and is powered by the same type of rechargeable batteries used in toys, watches and smart phones. The device is mainly made from the strongest metal titanium but outer sections that come into contact with the body are composed from cow tissue, to prevent the immune system from rejecting it. Its French manufacturers, Carmat, hope it will enable patients to lead a normal life and possibly be well enough to return to work. Around 750,000 Britons suffer from heart failure, the main reason to need a new heart, of whom half will die within a year of diagnosis. Although doctors have been attempting to transplant artificial hearts into patients since the 1980s, they have so far only worked for a few months at a time. For this reason they have only been given to a handful of patients while they wait for a donor heart to become available. The device is mainly made from the strongest metal titanium but outer sections that come into contact with the body are composed from cow tissue, to prevent the immune system from rejecting it . Over the next few weeks the surgeons will give three other patients with terminal heart failure as part of a medical trial. If deemed a success, the device will go on sale across Europe in 2015 at a price of between Â£120,000 and Â£150,000. The . manufacturer is now planning to make smaller implants to fit women and . the more petite bodies of patients in India and China. It . is sewn into the arteries and veins that surrounded the old the heart . and is wired to an external battery pack usually worn by the patient . around their waist. The device then mimics the same contractions of a normal heart to pump blood around the body. The male patient is said to be awake and responding well following the operation at the Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris . Around . 100,000 people in Europe and the US are waiting for a new heart but . only about 4,000 transplants take place every year as so few organs . become available. Alain Carpentier, who lead 16 surgeons performing the transplant on the Frenchman dying of heart failure, said: âItâs about giving patients a normal social life with the least dependence on medication possible. âWeâve already seen devices of this type but they had a relatively low autonomy. This heart will allow for more movement and less clotting.â Mr Carpentier, who has been developing . the device for 25 years, added: âHe [the patient] has a lot of humour. Heâs a very good patient.' Over the next few weeks the surgeons will give three other patients with terminal heart failure as part of a medical trial. If deemed a success, the device will go on sale across Europe in 2015 at a price of between Â£120,000 and Â£150,000 . The operation took roughly three hours to complete and surgeons said it had gone smoothly, without complications. Christian Latremouille, another surgeon who was involved said: âThe patient was nearing the end of his life. The intervention took place in good conditions. âThere were no complications linked to the innovative nature of the implant operation,â he said. âThe patient is not walking yet, but we but we will try to get him sitting and then standing soon enough. The objective is for him to have a normal life.â Marcello Convitto, chief executive of the firm said: âWe are delighted with this first implant, although it is premature to draw conclusions given that a single implant has been performed and that we are in the early postoperative phase.'","Man of 75 received the new heart on Wednesday night and is recovering well .

'When I started doing this project, I felt that the objects belonged to my relatives, starting from the ones of my beloved grandparents, were still full of energy and were capable of reminding me moments I shared with them. I started to feel the need to use them to go back to a precise memory. In order to do that I started to reorganize these objects, to recall a specific image I had of that person.

Alzheimer's disease could be diagnosed earlier after scientists pinpointed where it startsÂ  in the brain. The discovery means patients could benefit from starting treatment sooner. Researchers scanned the brains of 96 pensioners and tracked their health for three-and-a-half years. None had memory problems at the start of the study but 12 had developed mild Alzheimer's by the end. Discovery: This computer-generated image shows the results of the findings - that Alzheimer's disease begins in the entrohinal cotrex (shown in yellow), and then spreads to other cortical regions (shown in red) By closely examining the results from 96 adults, the scientists were able to see that, while 84 of the brains remained normal, the 12 which came to develop Alzheimer's shows reduced metabolic activity in the LEC area. The change, associated with declining memory, occurred at a time when all 12 volunteers were free of dementia. The study also showed how over time the effects of Alzheimer's spread from the LEC to other areas of the brain's cerebral cortex. One region especially targeted was the parietal cortex, an area involved in functions including spatial orientation and navigation. Lead researcher Professor Scott Small, director of Columbia University's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, said: 'It has been known for years that Alzheimer's starts in a brain region known as the entorhinal cortex. But this study is the first to show in living patients that it begins specifically in the lateral entorhinal cortex, or LEC. 'The LEC is considered to be a gateway to the hippocampus, which plays a key role in the consolidation of long-term memory, among other functions. If the LEC is affected, other aspects of the hippocampus will also be affected.' Research: The insight into the debilitating disease was carried out by Columbia University's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center . The scientists suspect Alzheimer's spreads through a kind of 'domino effect', whereby neurons affected in the LEC reduce the ability of neurons around them to resist the change. Two of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are sticky protein deposits in the brain called beta amyloid plaques, and 'tangles' of tau protein. A first step to accumulating beta amyloid is the production of amyloid precursor protein (APP). 'The LEC is especially vulnerable to Alzheimer's because it normally accumulates tau, which sensitises the LEC to the accumulation of APP,' said co-author Professor Karen Duff. 'Together, these two proteins damage neurons in the LEC, setting the stage for Alzheimer's.' Tests on mice confirmed that the same changes in the LEC seen in the volunteers were associated with raised tau and APP. The researchers used a high-resolution form of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map metabolic activity in the brains of the study participants. 'Now that we've pinpointed where Alzheimer's starts, and shown that those changes are observable using fMRI, we may be able to detect Alzheimer's at its earliest preclinical stage, when the disease might be more treatable and before it spreads to other brain regions,' said Prof Small. The new imaging method could also be used to assess potential new drug treatments at early stages of the disease, said the researchers.","Scientist from Columbia University in New York made the discovery .

Any refurbishment, which will include . removing asbestos, fixing leaky roofs and replacing the 1930s . electrical and heating systems, could cost more than Â£1âbillion. MPs reckon that film studios would pay at least Â£10,000 a day to hire the buildings. One said last night: âWeâd be mad not to hire the place out to the highest bidder. âOther imposing 19th Century . buildings make a fortuneÂ  providing interiors of what is supposed to be . inside theÂ  Commons. Letâs give them the real thing and save the . taxpayer some cash into the bargain.â Although TV cameras have been . recording Commons proceedings for more than a decade, any filming . connected to âadvertising, fundraising or for commercial purposesâ is . banned. A fake House of Commons was built for the filming of Jeffrey Archer's First Among Equals in 1986, it was then used for The Iron Lady . The Iron Lady was filmed in a 5,000 sq ft replica of The House of Commons instead of the real thing . The Treasury's circular court was used as a nightclub in the latest installment of The Fast and the Furious . Even dramas supposedlyÂ  set in . Westminster are filmed elsewhere, with Manchester Town Hall doubling as . Parliamentâs neo-gothic corridors and meeting rooms. In the 2011 film The Iron Lady, which . saw Meryl Streep win an Oscar for her portrayalÂ  of Margaret Thatcher, . theÂ  Commons chamber was actually a 5,000âsq ft replica. Earlier this year, the imitation . chamber â first used in Granada TVâs 1986 adaptation of Jeffrey Archerâs . First Among Equals â was sold on eBay for more than Â£123,000. Plans to allow filming in the House of Commons are designed to help with repairs to the building, including updates to the heating and electricity . But last week the Commons . Administration Committee agreed to allow âappropriate commercial . filmingâ on days when the House is not sitting. Officials stressed that the final . decision will have to be made by Speaker John Bercow and the ruling . House of Commons Commission. But one MP said: âEach bid for . filming would have to be assessed on its merits. However, if Steven . Spielberg turns up offering us a big cheque, and weâre not using the . building that day, it would be silly to turn it down. The money will . come in useful for all the repairs.â Other Whitehall buildings are already . hired out, including the Treasuryâs circular court, which was recently . used as an underground nightclub in Fast Six, the latest in the Fast And . The Furious film series. The Department of Energy and Climate . Change, whichÂ  has spectacular views of the capital, was also used in . the James Bond blockbuster Skyfall. But last night, oneÂ  senior Tory MP . raised doubts over the Commons film plan. Former defence Minister Sir Gerald . Howarth said: âThere is an aura and mystique about Parliament which we . must be very careful not to damage. We are trustees of one of the most . iconic and famous buildings in the world.â He also warned that there would be âsecurity implicationsâ over letting commercial film directors inside.","MPs agreed plans to hire out the Houses of Parliament to Hollywood .

"By . Brendan Carlin, Mail on Sunday Political Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:27 EST, 15 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:44 EST, 15 June 2013 . David Cameron has agreed to change his controversial EU referendum blueprint amid fears the original plans could unfairly produce a âstay inâ result. The Prime Minister has bowed to Eurosceptic pressure and revised the crucial âin/outâ question to be put to the nation if he wins the next Election. The alteration will see voters asked if the UK should âbeâ in the EU, rather than âremainâ as in the original wording. U turn: David Cameron bowed to Eurosceptic pressure and revised the crucial 'in/out' question to be put to the nation if he wins the next Election . The change will be confirmed this week when Tory MP James Wharton publishes a Bill to guarantee Mr Cameronâs promise to hold the referendum by the end of 2017. In a highly unusual move for a backbench MPâs legislation, the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary William Hague will sponsor the proposals to prove their commitment to a referendum. Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox, a leading figure of the Tory Right, and ex-Minister Sir Tony Baldry will also put their names to the Bill in a concerted effort to show the party is united on the referendum plan. Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of backbench MPs, is also sponsoring the Bill. Mr Cameron has been blocked from introducing the referendum plan by his pro-Brussels Liberal Democrat Coalition partners. The Mail on Sunday has learned that as well as throwing his weight behind the Bill, the Prime Minister privately agreed that the referendum question should be changed. Support: Stockton South MP Mr Wharton said he was pleased to have the Prime Minister's support on his bill. He said he is fighting to put a fair question to the British people . In proposals published last month, voters were asked: âDo you think that the UK should remain a member of the EU?â But . after anti-Brussels MPs privately protested that the word âremainâ would prompt voters to stay in, the wording has been changed. A source said: âInstead of âDo you want to remain in the EUâ it will simply ask voters if they want to âbeâ in the EU. Itâs a more neutral, fairer question.â Last night, experts said the change could be crucial. Damian Lyons Lowe, of pollsters Survation, said: âThe original question set out last month gave us 51 per cent in favour of leaving the EU and 49 per cent against in a survey. 'Thatâs a statistical dead-heat. But the rephrasing could tip the balance further in favour of leaving the EU.â The change has been made even though Mr CameronÂ  believes that Britain should remain in a reformed EU. Stockton South MP Mr Wharton said last night: âIâm extremely pleased that David Cameron is backing this important Bill, and that we have been able to make the changes we needed to ensure itâs a fair question that we put to the British people.â Spat: Tory Chairman Grant Shapps (pictured left) said Ed Miliband was 'too weak' to give his MPs s ay after the Labour leader urged his colleagues to abstain from voting . But sources confirmed the wording of any referendum would be vetted by the Electoral Commission before being put to the people. Tory MPs see legislating now for a post-election referendum as a vital sign to voters that Mr Cameron will keep his word if he is re-elected. However, with both the Lib Dems and Labour opposed to Mr Whartonâs proposals, the Bill is unlikely to become law even it clears its initial Commons hurdle. Labour leader Ed Miliband has urged his MPs not to take part in the first vote on the referendum plans due next month, with party sources dismissing the Bill as a âgimmickâ. That sparked accusations from Tory chairman Grant Shapps that Mr Miliband was âtoo weakâ to give his MPs, let alone the public, a say.","Changed the question from should the UK 'remain' in the EU to should the UK 'be' in the EU .

With sales of famous fragrances totting up to an astonishing Â£80bn worldwide, it's no surprise that every celebrity worth their stardust boasts at least one. And with 20 new star perfumes launching each and every year, there's no shortage of choice. But while some arrive to a round of applause, others have proved to be little more than a nasty whiff. So which of this year's crop are eau-so-good and worth splashing out on? Femail's fragrance testers are here to reveal which star scents are worth splashing out on - and which deserve a one-way ticket to the bin. BEST FOR FRIENDS (THAT YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE): KIM KARDASHIAN 'PURE HONEY' Best for friends: Kim Kardashian's Pure Honey is sickly sweet and is definitely not for minimal types . THE CLAIM: 'An alluring blend of raw wild honey and voluptuous florals, Pure Honey harnesses the legendary aphrodisiac power of honey to bring you Kim Kardashian's most sensual fragrance yet.' NOTES: Rose, honey, coconut . More... Secret crushes, sexual fantasies and embarrassing illnesses: Have YOU shared too much information at the office party? Have a chilled Christmas: The Freeze Queen takes the stress out of festive cooking with her top tips . 'I don't like the term plus-size': Tyra Banks on how body-image labels in the fashion industry are harmful to women . WE SAY: There's little we don't know about the Kardashians, and like Kim herself, what Pure Honey lacks in mystery, it makes up in sheer, unadulterated front. A blast of sickly sweet honeyed flowers emerges the second the top comes off the bottle, with an overpowering rose note front and centre. It's definitely not one for those who like their perfumes minimal but Kim's OTT effort is great for anyone who wants their perfume to deliver a powerfully scented punch. Once it's on, it's virtually impossible to get off and maintains its intensity for hours. Kim's latest EDT truly is the limpet of perfumes and can survive several well-soaped showers. Be warned. GET IT: Kim Kardashian Pure Honey, from Â£24, debenhams.com . BEST FOR SECRET SANTAS: KATY PERRY 'KILLER QUEEN' She kissed a girl: But don't go overboard with the squirts with this perfume if you ever want to be kissed yourself . THE CLAIM: 'A charmingly playful yet lethally gorgeous Floriental fragrance, opens with tempting dark berries and lush plum that blend into an opulent floral heart.' NOTES: Bergamot, orange flower and sandalwood . WE SAY: Boasting . quite the fruity past herself, a scent sold by the former Mrs Russell . Brand was always bound to be bound up in apples, plums, berries and the . occasional whiff of tangerine. A playfully youthful fragrance, brave is the woman over 25 who steps out doused in this. Understated elegance and grace is not something the perfume - nor Perry herself - do particularly well. In other news, the bottle's base is a point, which means it can't stand up and flops onto its side and looks drunk - which you'll be if you inhale too much of this high-intensity stuff. GET IT: Killer Queen by Katy Perry, from Â£23, superdrug.com . BEST FOR THE (EX) BOYFRIEND: DAVID BECKHAM 'CLASSIC' Eau de Becks: Despite a dodgy gin and tonic accord, Classic lives up to most of its claims . THE CLAIM: 'Capturing the unique spirit of Davidâs iconic style, which blends traditional tailoring with modern flair, this woody citrus spicy scent is the perfect expression of contemporary elegance.' NOTES: Cypress Orpur, Gin Tonic Accord, Vevetier . WE SAY: It's certainly woody, definitely spicy and surprisingly sophisticated, although it does owe a hat tip to the very classic Old Spice. Bum notes include the Gin Tonic Accord which barely registers and the massive dose of nutmeg which lends it a slightly metallic edge. Dodgy accords aside, eau de Beckham lives up to the majority of its claims and is definitely one to slip into his stocking. GET IT: David Beckham Classic, Â£24.50, theperfumeshop.com . BEST FOR HORMONAL NIECES: ONE DIRECTION 'OUR MOMENT' Teen dream: One Direction's Our Moment is likely to prove popular with teenage fans and Simon Cowell . THE CLAIM: 'The sparkling, juicy and feminine fragrance is made up of splashes of fresh fruit and seasonal flowers infused with undertones of warm musk.' NOTES: Pink grapefruit, jasmine, patchouli . WE SAY: It's certainly fruity but there's very little that's fresh about the British boyband's debut fragrance. Our Moment is an olfactory sugar rush that clings to skin and clothes like a limpet and boasts all the sophistication of a One Direction concert - in short, not much. That said, eau de One Direction isn't really aimed at adults although grown-up wallets are certainly at the top of the hit list. Currently outselling all other celebrity fragrances by a staggering five to one, it's proof that appealing to teenage hearts and parental bank accounts works like a charm. Simon Cowell, you'd imagine, will be having a very happy Christmas indeed. GET IT: One Direction 'Our Moment', from Â£17, boots.com . BEST FOR CELEBRITY PERFUME HATERS: RIHANNA 'ROGUE' Subtle: The least offensive of the lot, Rihanna's perfume is blessedly subtle . THE CLAIM: 'Rihanna made it for all women, for every mood, because we all want to project our true selves. Show your strength and beauty and go Rogue.' NOTES: Cyclamen, plum, amber, patchouli . WE SAY: Soapy, light, breezy, quite summery: Rihanna's concoction is not entirely without merit. It's far less knock-you-sideways than many other celebrity scents on the market, and is probably the one that would least cause strangers sitting next to you on the train to move seats over. Undeniably fruity, flowery, youthful and tooth-achingly sweet, it doesn't cling to the skin as much as lesser fragrances do, so once it begins to make you nauseous you can probably babywipe it off pretty swiftly.

ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE NICE: BRITNEY SPEARS 'MIDNIGHT FANTASY' She sure is Impulsive: Britney's cloying scent will have you remember sleepovers aged 11 . THE CLAIM: 'The story of Fantasy Britney Spears unfolds with lush red lychee, golden quince and exotic kiwi.' NOTES: Quince, jasmine, iris . WE SAY: Ah, being a preteen. Those were the days. Popcorn-fuelled sleepovers, painting your toenails and clogging your parents ventilation system with the cloying scent of nine different cans of Impulse body spray. Sadly, thanks to Britney Spears and her riotously pungent Fantasy, those days are back. Run for the hills. GET IT: Britney Spears Midnight Fantasy, Â£25, superdrug.com . GUILTY PLEASURE: MADE IN CHELSEA FOR WOMEN . Surprisingly sophisticated: The contents of this green bottle could get you your very own Spencer Matthews . THE CLAIM: 'Made in Chelsea is a Luxury blend of soft florals and juicy fruits with a woody dry down.' NOTES: Orange, mint, lily of the valley, frankincense . WE SAY: The cheap-looking mint green bottle isn't very classy but surprisingly, what's inside isn't as bad as you might expect. Kicking off on a fruity note, toned down by a liberal dose of mint, it dries down into a wearable, if ordinary, musky wood. If you're heading down to Bodo's Schloss and fancy finding yourself a Made in Chelsea boy (Spencer anyone?) then this could be just the ticket.

A third person connected to a grisly murder involving a Chicago teen luring her ex-boyfriend's brother to her new lover who brutally murdered him and butchered his lifeless corpse has been arrested. Milton Miranda, 22, killed Jose Reyes, 30,while Daisy Gutierrez watched before helping conceal evidence, police said. He was arrested Saturday in New Jersey and will join his 19-year-old girlfriend and her father behind bars while awaiting trial. Salvadore Gutierrez, the girl's father, was also arrested for helping bury the viciously murdered man's remains in his back yard, police said. Co-conspirators: Daisy Gutierrez, 19, left, is charged with first-degree murder for luring a man to his death. Her boyfriend Milton Miranda, 22, right, is also charged with first-degree for committing the brutal act . Also implicated: Father Salvadore Gutierrez, 56, has been charged with helping to try to conceal the body . Mr Miranda was arrested Saturday in New Jersey and extradited to Illinois, the Chicago Police Department announced Sunday. The couple is alleged by police to have hatched a plan to lure her former flame's boyfriend into the girl's bedroom where she stripped off her clothes May 21 before Mr Miranda came bursting through the door, beat the unwitting man with a pipe and slit his throat, the Chicago Sun-Times. Ms Gutierrez had previously been in a relationship with Mr Reyes' brother that produced more than one child, and he had expressed an interest in her, sources told the paper. Not content to just beat and stab the innocent man to death, Mr Miranda then hacked off his head and butchered the rest of his body so it would fit into plastic bags, authorities said. The deranged girl has been charged with concealing a homicide for watching as Mr Miranda brutally murdered and slaughtered the victim after police say she admitted to doing so. An autopsy confirmed the official cause of death was âmultiple sharp force injuriesâ and âassault.â Grisly: Police say Jose Reyes, 30, was brutally slain and dismembered by a vengeful new boyfriend of Daisy Gutierrez on May 21 . Tricked: The 30-year-old Honduran had moved to the U.S. five years before his brutal murder. Police say he was lured to his death by Daisy Gutierrez . Once sure Mr Reyes was dead, the heartless girl called her father to tell him she 'fixed the problem,' a source told the Sun-Times. She convinced to help conceal the body, he spent three hours digging a hole in his backyard and watched as Mr Miranda placed the body parts in plastic bags into the hole, cops said. The perverse pair then fled to New Jersey but was quickly arrested. Mr Reyes' body was found by police only days later after they searched the home. It is unknown what prompted detectives to look for Reyes at the Gutierrez residence. It is also unclear what prompted the teen mother of three - who is also three months pregnant with her new boyfriendâs child - to admit to the crime along with her father. House of horrors: Police say this house on the South Side of Chicago was the site of the unthinkable crime . Awful: Investigators found Reyes' dismembered remains in plastic bags in the backyard. Ms Gutierrez and her father admitted to helping bury the evidence, police said . Her bond was set at $2 million. His fatherâs was set at $500,000. Police say they also found human body parts in jars in the house. They have not yet determined whether those remains belong to Reyes or to someone else. Assistant stateâs attorney Heather Kent said Gutierrez has a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old with Reyesâ brother. The father of those two boys and the grieving brother of the victim spoke previously about the ordeal. 'My sons can't stay with people like that,' Jorge Moncada said in Spanish. 'I'm going to fight for them.' Unwanted advances: Mr Reyes was the brother of Ms Gutierrez's ex-boyfriend and had apparently taken a liking to the teen before her jealous lover savagely killed him, cut him into pieces and buried his body . He also said these tragic events are entirely surprising. 'She threatened me and my brother several times, she planned this,' said Mr Moncada. According to her public defender, Ms Gutierrezâs third child, a three-year-old, is with another man. She is pregnant with Mr Mirandaâs child. After she conspired with Mr Miranda to kill Mr Reyes, police say she asked her family to leave the house so that she could have him over. Daisy and Salvador Gutierrez admitted to the crimes under questioning from investigators. Neighbors of Mr Reyes' held a collection to help the family repatriate his body to Honduras. 'He was a wonderful person, a really hard worker, really nice. Like a neighbor he always helped,' a neighbor said.","Police say 19-year-old Daisy Gutierrez lured Jose Reyes, 30, into the deadly clutches of her jealous boyfriend using a striptease .

But his family has now insisted that they have never forgotten him and that they have continued to fight for his release - but that they simply do not know what to do to free him. Scroll down for videos . Plea: An image shows Warren Weinstein appealing to President Obama to . negotiate his release in a video sent anonymously to reporters. The video of Weinstein was the first since 2 videos released in September 2012 . Former life: In images before his capture, Weinstein looks far younger than . in the newly-released video. He was working as an economic developer in . Pakistan when he was kidnapped by al-Qaeda 2 years ago .

His daughter Jennifer Coakley said that telling her seven-year-old daughter that her grandfather had been kidnapped 'was one of the hardest things ever'. She asked: 'It's my birthday coming up - is he going to be home for this one?' Coakley said. 'And how do you answer that for a kid?' she said. 'It's such a burden on them at such a young age to have to go through that.

In . the newly-released video, Weinstein says: 'Nine years ago, I came to . Pakistan to help my government and I did so at a time when most . Americans would not come here. And how, when I need my government, it . seems I have been totally abandoned and forgotten. 'Needless . to say, I've been suffering deep anxiety every part of every day, not . knowing what is happening to my family and not knowing how they are and . because I am not with them.' Loved: They share photos with ABC as Jennifer says she struggled to tell her toddler children the truth . Scene: Weinstein was kidnapped from his house in Lahore, Pakistan, pictured, in August 2011 . He also appeals directly to President Obama for help. 'Mr. Obama, you're a family man,' he says. 'You understand the deep mental anxiety and anguish that I have been experiencing for these past more than two years. 'And therefore I'm appealing to you on a humanitarian basis, if nothing else, and asking that you take the necessary actions to expedite my release and my return to my family and to my country.'

Dallas billionaire and heavyweight GOP political donor Harold Simmons, who has given tens of millions of dollars to Republican candidates, has died aged 82. Simmons, born to two school teachers in East Texas, became one of the richest men in the country with interests ranging from energy to chemicals. Simmons' spokesman Chuck McDonald said Simmons died yesterday in Dallas. McDonald said he did not know the cause of death. Harold Simmons: The 'Texas giant', pictured in his North Dallas office in 2007, died yesterday at the age of 82 . Perry called Simmons 'a true Texas giant, rising from humble beginnings and seizing the limitless opportunity for success we so deeply cherish in our great state'. 'His legacy of hard work and giving ... will live for generations,' Perry said in a statement. Simmons' wife, Annette Simmons, told The Dallas Morning News her husband died at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. She said he'd been in Baylor's intensive care unit for the last eight days, the newspaper reported. She did give the cause of death. Attorney General Greg Abbott noted in a statement that Simmons 'shared his success with the state he dearly loved, giving generously to make advancements in healthcare and to improve higher education'. Simmons' has given tens of millions to Texas organizations, including charities, medical groups, education groups and civic organizations. A UT Southwestern Medical Center said his donations to their institution alone approached $200 million. He has also given money to political candidates, including Texas Governor Rick Perry and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney. He currently sits at No. 40 on Forbes' list of the 400 wealthiest Americans with a net worth of $10 billion as of the fall, according to Forbes. 'Harold Simmons was one of my best friends, and it's never easy to say goodbye to close friends' Texas oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens said in a statement. 'Harold accomplished so much in his life. He was a passionate person - passionate about his family, his business, philanthropy and politics ... We should all leave such a rich legacy behind.' Politically active: Harold Simmons had given tens of millions of dollars to GOP candidates and last year described Barack Obama as 'the most dangerous American alive' According to a biography on his namesake foundation's website, Simmons earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Texas. He decided at the age of 29 to buy a small Dallas drugstore, according to his biography. He went on to buy Williams Drug Co. in 1966 and 30 more drug stores the next year, followed by an $18 million buyout of Ward's Drugstores in 1969. He sold his stores in 1973 for $50 million in Eckerd stock. He then started a career as an investor, buying major positions in publicly traded companies. In 2008, Simmons bankrolled ads linking then-presidential candidate Barack Obama to William Ayers, a Vietnam-era militant who helped found the violent Weather Underground. Simmons was also a key backer of the Swift Boat Veterans' attacks on Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004. Simmons also called Obama 'the most dangerous American alive' in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last year. According to The Dallas Morning News, his foundation has also recently donated $600,000 to Resource Center, a group that serves the city's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.

New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio says he is proud of his daughter for the deeply personal YouTube video posted Christmas Eve detailing her struggle with drugs, alcohol and mental health issues. Chiara de Blasio, 19, claimed during the surprising video that she's struggled with depression and anxiety most of her life and that she turned to substances in order to cope. The mayor-elect said during a Sunday news conference that he and his wife even paid for the video's production, Newsday reported. Scroll down for video . In a surprise confessional video posted to YouTube Christmas Eve, the daughter of NYC mayor elect Bill de Blasio confesses to her history of drug and alcohol abuse and depression . Kicked the habit: Chiara says she smoked weed and drank in order to help her with her depression and anxiety in social situations. She says she's since kicked the habits thanks to a treatment program . 'We're so proud of our daughter,' the soon-to-be mayor said. 'It took courage. It took strength. It was an incredibly genuine explanation in her own words of what she confronted and how she overcame it.' The de Blasios hired former Obama campaign commercial director John Del Cacato to make the confessional, a spokesperson told the paper. The spokesperson declined to discuss costs or release timing with the paper. The revelation came just a week before her father is sworn into office January 1, an office Chiara actually helped him win as she campaigned often with her family. 'It made it easier the more I drank and did drugs,' said the Santa Clara University sophomore. 'Removing substances from my life has opened so many doors for me,' Chiara says in the video, her face alight with a big smile. 'I was actually able to participate in my dad's campaign and that was, like, the greatest thing ever.' Success: Chiara is now clean and sober, she says, and the change has allowed her to work with her father on his successful bid to become New York's first democratic mayor in 20 years . But, she says, it was a difficult road getting to that point. 'Getting sober is always a positive thing,' Chiara says, but 'it's the hardest thing I've ever done.'

Rare bank notes once deemed worthless are set to sell for a staggering $5.7 million after they were found in a U.S. bankers' drawer. The notes, which date back to the 1880s and total $3,500 in the old money, are now tipped to sell at auction for 1,700 times their face value. They have miraculously survived the 130 years in mint condition and one is among the first ever bank notes to be printed in the U.S. and one of only two left in the world. Mint condition: The rare bank notes, which include this $500 gold certificate, are set to fetch 1,700 times their face value when they sell at auction after they were found in a U.S. banker's drawer in perfect condition . The currency includes three $1,000 notes and one $500 note. The rarest of the collection is an 1882 $500 gold certificate, among the first ever bank notes printed in America and expected to fetch $2.4 million alone. The two 1882 $1,000 gold certificates and an 1890 $1,000 treasury note are estimated to sell for $1.07 million each. Gold certificates were initially issued by banks as proof of a deposit of gold bullion in their vaults but went on to become forms of money in their own right. They circulated as money until 1933 . when the U.S. government banned private gold ownership and withdrew the . certificates from circulation, making them worthless. Incredibly, from that point on it was illegal to own gold certificates until 1964 when the government lifted its ban. Once considered worthless: This $1,000 treasury note made in 1890 is tipped to sell for $1.07 million, as are two 1882 $1,000 gold certificates . As good as gold: Gold certificates such as this one were issued by banks as proof of deposit of gold bullion in their vaults but went on to become forms of money in their own right . In the late 1800s $3,500 was equivalent to about $80,000 in today's money. Dustin Johnston, director of rare currency at Heritage Auctions, said: âThis 1882 $500 gold certificate is one of the earliest gold certificates printed. âThey were very strictly controlled and were printed in very low quantities so survivors are few and far between. âThe only other one in the world is in the Smithsonian museum as part of the Federal Reserve collection. âIt is so historically valuable that I would say it is one of the top 10 greatest currency notes of all time. âAmazingly it has come from the estate of a deceased turn-of-the-century US banker along with three very scarce $1,000 notes. Trophy find: This 1882 $500 gold certificate is the rarest of the collection, among the first ever bank notes ever printed in the U.S. - one of only two in the world . âIt is very interesting that they were kept for that long. In 1933 when Franklin Roosevelt outlawed the possession of gold to combat the depression he also demonetized gold certificates. It was the first time the US had taken currency and made it worthless. âIt had to have been a complete oversight of the banker that owned these notes to sit on them during the recession. â$3,500 was a tremendous amount money back - the average salary was about $2,500. âWe can only guess the banker forgot about the notes because they were only discovered much later by the banker's family in a drawer. âIt is an absolute trophy find. Maybe once in a generation a note of this magnitude shows up - and four turned up all at once. âThe odds of survival are so low we didn't ever expect to see these notes again - we thought they were gone for good. âThese notes are so sought after they could well go beyond our estimates.â The notes will be sold at the auction in Orlando, Florida, on January 10.","The rare bank notes date back to the 1880s and are set to sell for $5.7m .

He met with Celeste, a stylist at The Emerge Salon on Newberry St, just a street away from where the bombs went off, and Sydney, who was a high school student, to apologize for the way he'd had to photograph them on that day, and they agreed to let him document their recovery.

'If Sydney would have died, I don't think I would have... I think I would have died with her,' Celeste Corcoran told the Boston Globe. They wound up in the same recovery room and were later placed side-by-side in hospital beds. Three weeks later Sydney Corcoran was cleared to go home, her legs crisscrossed with foot-long veins.

Since the bombings, the Corcorans have been showered in gifts, love and support. The Celeste and Sydney Corcoran Facebook page depicts the two meeting sports stars and singers, television presenters and movie stars. Sydney was crowned the prom queen of her Lowell high school and Celeste was given a standing ovation by the crowd at a Michael Buble concert. But between public smiles and milestones were the private setbacks that didn't appear on Facebook or in the newspapers. Sydney had to undergo several emergency operations on her legs, and began injecting herself in the stomach every day with blood thinners.

'When I see her strength, and her pushing through things, I feel like I have to do the same thing,' Celeste told the Boston Globe. 'I feel like we definitely help each other.' As 2013 comes to a close, the family is through the worst of the health crises and rehabilitation process. Celeste is growing steadier on her feet every day, and the family is building a new, one-storey home in Dracut with money they received from the Marathon survivors' One Fund. Celeste will be able to use her wheelchair with ease in the home. Healing together: Celeste and Sydney Corcoran have had a traumatic 2013 but made it through together . On December 18, Celeste passed her driving test so that she can get a car with hand gears. Up until now, she has been dependent on her son and husband to get around. She has begun working selected hours back at her beloved Emerge Salon where she has been sorely missed by colleagues and clients. 'When I do something like that by myself, when I do something that I thought I wouldn't be able to do, like climb up that step by myself, climb up that rock wall, what I really want to say is, f*** you terrorists,' Celeste told the Boston Globe.

Specifically engineered to work in the harsh conditions in which Soviet troops operated, it became one of the most successful weapons ever produced and turned its inventor into one of the most lauded men in the Soviet Union. Cheap, efficient and easily mass-produced, the gun soon became synonymous with killing on a sometimes indiscriminate scale.

The weapon, named for its inventor and the year when it was created, was never patented in Russia so was widely copied . The AK-47's story truly began in 1942, when Soviet soldiers siezed new-style automatic rifles from German troops. Unlike traditional or semi-automatic rifles, they could fire a whole magazine of bullets simply by holding down the trigger, because the recoil from each shot ejected the previous cartridge. Entrenched in the conflict of the Second World War, the Soviets set to work straight away on copying the Nazis' designs. But their first versions were clunky, weighing more than 5kg without bullets, and the task of creating a new design fell to Mikhail Kalashnikov, who had created an unsuccessful gun prototype earlier in the war. His design mashed together the best elements of previous weapons and won a competition in 1946, going into full production the next year. Accuracy was not its strongest point but it endured for its simplicity and reliability in even the harshest of conditions - built, as it was, in the wilds of Siberia. It was not patented - opening the door for millions of 'pirate' versions - because of the culture which existed in the Communist state. All ideas were property of the government, not one individual person, and pride came from helping the great Soviet army. Source: World Guns . There are an estimated 100 million .

Its vast popularity was partly down to the fact its design was never patented, so it was widely ripped off. This was accelerated by the Soviet Union's policy of allowing friendly countries to imitate its designs of weaponry to strengthen its position during the Cold War. The Kalashnikov was prized for its sturdy reliability in difficult conditions. During the Vietnam war American soldiers reportedly threw away their M-16s in the harsh jungle and took every AK-47 they could find. The 205-year-old Izmash factory, which makes the weapon and is seen by Russians as a national icon, always complained that its . potential income was hit badly by the 'pirated' versions . of the designs made abroad. But . Izmash has also suffered from dwindling demand and a failure to make up . for this with foreign orders - a problem plaguing many specialised . post-Soviet industries. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met Mr Kalashnikov just three months ago, expressed his 'deep condolences' over his death. Born in a Siberian village as the 17th . child of his family on November 10, 1919, Mr Kalashnikov had a tragic childhood . during which his father was deported under Soviet dictator Joseph . Stalin in 1930. In October . 1941 he was heavily wounded and . shell-shocked in a Soviet defeat by the Germans. He reportedly first conceived of the weapon while recovering in hospital. Despite the lethal legacy of his weapon, Russia lavished Mr Kalashnikov with honours including the prestigious Hero of Russia prize, the nation's highest honour, for designing the iconic rifle. In 2007, president Vladimir Putin praised him, saying 'The Kalashnikov rifle is a symbol of the creative genius of our people.' The inventor had said he had never intended for it to become the world's most popular weapon, and he fell into making it by accident. Instead he had wanted to design farm equipment 'such as a lawnmower', he claimed. Yet he carried on working as the chief designer at Izmash well into his 80s. He profited little from his gun, and almost not at all before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Because of the lack of patent laws he was, like the inventors of more harmless global successes like Tetris, merely a state employee. 'I created a weapon to defend the fatherland's borders,' he said during an award ceremony at the Kremlin to mark his 90th birthday. Fame: Despite the advent of hundreds of other guns, the AK-47 by Mikhail Kalashnikov (pictured with his designs) led the pack for its hard-wearing simplicity and the ease with which it could be copied . The former Siberian peasant, pictured in 2002, continued working as a leading gun designer well into his 80s . Celebration: The ageing inventor had a complex legacy but was honoured as a Russian hero . Indirectly, Mikhail Kalashnikov leaves a bloody legacy. He claimed he would rather have invented a lawnmower . 'It's not my fault that it was sometimes used where it shouldn't have been. This is the fault of politicians.' On another occasion he said: 'After the collapse of the great and mighty Soviet Union so much c**p has been imposed on us, especially on the younger generation. I wrote six books to help them find their way in life.' There is a bronze bust of him in his . native village of Kurya in the Siberian region of Altai - and it is a . local tradition for newlyweds to lay flowers there. 'They whisper ""Uncle Misha, wish us happiness and healthy kids,"" he once said. ""What other gun designer can boast of that?""'

The drug, also known as Special K, is currently rated Class C. But the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) has now recommended that it should be reclassified because of the mental and physical harm it causes. Ketamine should be upgraded to a Class B substance, Government advisers have said. The drug, also known as Special K, is currently rated Class C . Ketamine users as young as 20 are having to have their bladders removed due to heavy consumption of the drug, ACMD chairman Professor Les Iversen warned earlier this year. Normally, the bladder wall expands when filled with urine and contracts when emptied. But extreme ketamine use can cause stiffness and scarring in the bladder walls, meaning it can only expand to a tenth of its normal size. Some drug abusers face wearing a catheter for life. Originally designed as an anaesthetic and tranquilliser, often used on horses during veterinary surgery, ketamine was banned as a recreational drug in 2006. An estimated 120,000 people used it in England and Wales during 2012/13, figures suggest. Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned the ACMD in March last year to refresh its advice on ketamine, which was last reviewed in 2004. Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned the review into ketamine last year after mounting medical evidence showed the harm it can cause . The council said: 'The ACMD recommends that ketamine be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) as a Class B substance. 'This was not a unanimous decision but it is a majority recommendation from both the council and its Ketamine Working Group. The advice says that 'although there is limited evidence of ketamine misuse causing social harm, evidence of physical harmÂ  - mainly chronic bladder toxicity' - has increased since the last recommendation of 2004. If the drug is upgraded to Class B, people caught with it in their possession could face up to five years in prison and ketamine dealers could be jailed for up to 14 years. Other Class B drugs include cannabis, amphetamines, such as speed, and barbiturates. Earlier this year surgeons in Leeds, London and Bristol said there were a growing number of young people struggling with severe side effects. Teenagers are having their bladders stretched and removed as a result of taking it. David Gillatt, one of the UK's leading urological surgeons, told Channel 4 News he had removed three bladders by June. He said: 'Ketamine gets into the urine and inflames the bladder, it makes the lining come off like a burn. As it tries to heal itself, it scars and becomes a small shrunken bladder. 'Some users experience pain in the lower abdomen, blood in their urine and problems controlling their bladders.'","The drug, also known as Special K, is currently rated as Class C .

As he defended the decision to charge VAT on hot food served by shops and supermarkets, dubbed the pasty tax, Mr Cameron declared: 'I'm a pasty eater myself. 'I go to Cornwall on holiday. I love a hot pasty. I think the last time I bought one was from the West Cornwall Pasty Company. 'I seem to remember I was in Leeds station at the time. The choice was to have one of their small ones or their large ones. I've got a feeling I opted for the large one and very good it was too.' Mr Cameron admitted journalists would probably try and find out if this was true and they did discover the particular branch he was referring to, had actually closed down in 2007.

A Russian hacker took over a BBC computer server before trying to sell access to the system on Christmas Day. It is understood the corporation's security team responded to the issue three days later on Saturday but now believes it has secured the site. It is not known whether the hacker stole data or caused any damage during the attack. A hacker is understood to have taken over a computer server at the BBC and tried to sell access to the site on Christmas Day (pictured is the BBC's Broadcasting House, in London) The hacker is understood to have compromised a server that manages a password-protected website, typically used to manage the transfer of large data files over the Internet. A BBC spokesman told Reuters: 'We do not comment on security issues.' US cybersecurity firm Hold Security LLC first identified the incident. The company monitors underground cyber-crime forums in search of stolen information. Alex Holden, Hold Security's founder and chief information security officer, told Reuters how the firm's researchers spotted a notorious Russian hacker, known online as 'HASH' and 'Rev0lver' attempting to sell access to the server on Christmas Day. The hacker offered proof he had infiltrated the site by showing files which could only be accessed by somebody controlling it, Mr Holden said. He said the firm had found no evidence any conversations led to a deal or that data was stolen from the BBC. It is not known whether the hacker stole data or caused any damage during the attack (file picture) It is common for hackers to buy and sell access to compromised servers on underground forums. Hackers may use such infiltrations to gain further access to the victim organisation's systems. Compromised servers can also be used to set up command-and-control centers for cyber-crime operations known as botnets, run spam campaigns or launch denial of service attacks to knock websites off line. Justin Clarke, a principal consultant for the cybersecurity firm Cylance Inc, told Reuters while 'HASH' was only offering access to an obscure FTP server, some buyers might see it as a stepping stone to more prized assets within the BBC. He said: 'Accessing that server establishes a foothold within BBC's network which may allow an attacker to pivot and gain further access to internal BBC resources,' he said. Media companies, including the BBC, have repeatedly been targeted by the Syrian Electronic Army, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and other hacker activist groups that deface websites and take over Twitter accounts. Last January the New York Times reported that it had been repeatedly attacked over four months by Chinese hackers who obtained employees' passwords.","Notorious Russian hacker spotted selling access on Christmas Day .

Five people have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences in connection with the death of a Royal Navy veteran who died after drinking a bottle of pear drink filled with cocaine. Joromie Lewis, 33, of Gosport, Hampshire, became ill immediately after drinking the pear fruit drink, which contained a lethal amount of the drug. His death on December 5 led the Food Standards Agency to issue an alert to all local authorities to contact retailers to withdraw any bottles of Pear D from their shelves.

Detective superintendent Dick Pearson said: 'This is a complex investigation covering the circumstances surrounding Mr LewisÃ¢â¬â¢ death, as well as the drug trafficking offences. 'Mr LewisÃ¢â¬â¢ family have been kept up to date with developments, including these five arrests for drugs offences.' The details of the arrests come as a private family funeral was being held today for Mr Lewis in his home town.

Former teacher Derek Ide, 67, from Southampton, has been jailed for more than three years for a sex attack on a nine-year-old boy in Trinidad. The incident occurred on Ide's yacht in the town of Chaguaramas (file picture) Ide pleaded guilty to serious indecency after prosecutors on the tropical island amended the charge from grievous sexual assault. The ex-teacher, from Southampton, Hampshire, has spent at least half a year in Trinidad for the past eight years, Port of Spain Magistrates Court heard. He was arrested after the boy told his parents - who are not native to Trinidad - about the assault. Ide was held by the boy's father, who then contacted police and officers arrested him in April. During his first court appearance shortly after the offence, Ide cupped his hand over his left ear during the proceedings and sported a black eye. Ide initially denied grievous sexual assault but changed his plea to guilty to a lesser charge of serious indecency. Now a magistrate on the tropical island has sentenced him to three years and four months behind bars. Former tutor: Derek Ide used to be a teacher at Bellemoor High School for Boys, now Upper Shirley School in Southampton . Under Trinidad law, Ide could have faced up to ten years behind bars. However Maureen Baboolal-Gafoor sentenced him after telling the court children needed protection from sexual predators. Sean Cazabon, mitigating, said an application will be made to the British High Commission to have him extradited. The teacher - who was convicted of a similar offence in the UK in 1983 - is willing to receive therapy and counselling when he is deported, he said. Neighbours near Ide's home in Southampton spoke of their shock at his arrest.

His parents had to make the heartbreaking decision to switch off his life support machine when doctors made it clear he couldn't be saved. Mrs Clarkson added: 'His final wish was to become a superhero. That is what he has become in our eyes. Christmas this year was dreadful. 'The children came down and didn't know whether to open their presents or not. They have been staying strong for us and we have been trying to stay strong for them.' Jack's funeral will be held at South Shields Crematorium at 11.30am on Tuesday, December 31. The family want it to be a celebration of a young life. Donations in lieu of flowers can be made to CLIC Sargent, a children's charity that funds research and supports families of those suffering from cancers and tumours. Jack's older brother, Ryan Clarkson, 20, has already begun raising cash for the charity by taking part in the Boxing Day Dip in South Shields. Mourners â including school friends from Holy Trinity â will all wear something green, Jack's favourite colour while his coffin will be adorned by artwork of his superhero favourite Batman. Mr Leggett added: 'CLIC Sargent is a charity that does a lot of good work for children.

Former NFL star Andre Rison has revealed how he wasted $1 million on jewelry, bought three cars in a season and even once lost back-to-back houses to compete with teammates, sending him broke. The ex-millionaire spent a fortune trying to look rich when he hit the big time, splashing out thousands of dollars at nightclubs for his entourage of 40 people and throwing down $100 tips. But the 46-year-old's recklessness came at a price - he was forced to declare bankruptcy due to overdue child support debts, barely escaped prison and now  works as a student assistant coach at Michigan State. Scroll down for video . Extravagant: Former NFL star Andre Rison has revealed how he wasted $1m on jewelry and bought three cars in a season just to keep up with teammates . Rison shared his incredible story of going from extreme wealth to financial ruin in ESPNâs 'Broke' documentary, which also explored the flashy lifestyles of other pro athletes. 'When you have cash, you create debt,' Rison said. 'You spend until youâve got nothing leftâ¦ I should have . saved a lot more money. I should have saved a lot more money.' Rison played 12 seasons in the NFL after being selected in the first round of the NFL DraftÂ  in 1989. In 1995, he signed a five-year, $17 million contract to the Browns, which was then the most lucrative ever for a wide receiver, according to Grantland. He made at least $19 million over his career, with base salaries ranging from $175,000 in 1990 to $2.8 million in 1996. Celebrity Networth estimates his current fortune to be just $50,000. But his sudden wealth and fame eventually took its toll. The competitive player admitted he had no idea about the tax system and felt pressure to 'keep up with the Joneses'. Regrets: Andre Rison wished he saved more money than he spent over his successful NFL career . Excessive: Andre Rison has revealed how he bought multiple cars in one season . 'Now all of a sudden youâve got this bank account you control. You can go to it, pull out anytime, put in any time, but at the time we were only pulling out,' he said in the documentary. 'I guarantee I spent a million dollars on jewelry ... We were draped in jewelry.' The Michigan native shared tales of buying multiple cars within a season to compete with teammatesÂ  and spending lavishly at nightclubs. 'How much is this [car]? It doesnât matter, just get it,' he said. 'We were going to new levels. We were making it snow. You start throwing $100 bills instead of . fives. So youâve got a competition going on now. 'Iâd . be lying on the bed knocked out (after getting back from the club) with . $10,000 lying on the floor. Iâve got another $5,000 in my pocket. You . might find another $7,500 in the pocket in my coat.' Rison's rise to fame in the 1990s . coincided with 'the first intersection of hip-hop, profligacy, romantic . obsession, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and comic books', Grantland reported. According to the ESPN documentary, NFL players wanted to be entertainers, competing with each other on and off the field with the flashiest cars, bling and social life. During his first decade in the NFL, . Rison was called 'Bad Moon' Rison, known for talking trash, berating . coaching staff and teammates and skipping meetings.

His rocky relationship with Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes, the rapper from TLC, during the 1990s was infamous. The couple appeared in an Atlanta courtroom in October 1993 after an incident in which heâs alleged to have hit her and fired a gun. Their volatile relationship again made headlines the following year when Lopes set a fire in a bathtub of Rison's mansion that spread to the rest of the house until it burned to the ground. In 2001, a year before she died, he rapped with Lopes on a song called 'Rags to Riches'. But the star's major fall from grace came last year when he was sentenced in federal court to five years' probation and required to pay more than $300,000 in restitution for failure to pay child support. Rison was convicted for failing to pay more than $10,000 of child support between August 2008 and August 2011. In addition to the penalties for past due payments, and as a condition of his probation, Rison is expected to continue monthly child support payments of close to $2,350 per month. The documentary claims that 78 . percent of former NFL players have gone bankrupt or are under financial . stress two years into retirement. Many tend to find money tight in the off-season when the paychecks cease.

'But then he suddenly died of a heart attack and because he hadn't changed his will, we are being told we are entitled to nothing.' Wieslawa was urged into having the DNA test after hiring a private detective to help her. Private investigator Krzysztof Rutkowski found that Irek had also had affairs with a string of other women and even had two other children from another woman.

These stunning images show what must surely be one of the world's most unpleasant jobs - mining for sulphur on the side of a volcano in Indonesia. Locals near the Ijen volcano complex risk their lives to get their hands on the foul-smelling mineral, and are usually paid just a few pounds a day. The intrepid miners clamber over sharp rock faces, braving sheer drops from the side of the 2,600-metre-high active volcano which could erupt at any time. Foul: A miner breaks up chunks of sulphur on the side of the Ijen volcano complex in Indonesia . Danger: The intrepid locals scramble over risky rock faces and brave sheer drops with their precious cargo . Haul: Sulphur is used in a number of common industrial processes such as manufacturing cosmetics and plastics . They make their way around a 200-metre-deep lake bubbling with sulphuric acid to gather the valuable substance, which is used in a number of industrial processes. These photographs were captured by Robertus Pudyanto, who chronicles the everyday risks taken by the Indonesian miners. The quietly active volcano emits gases through fumaroles inside the crater, and local miners have tapped those gases to earn a living,' he said.

Burden: But this man carrying 3kg of sulphur will have been paid just a few pounds per day . Starting again: Miners walk back down to the crater with empty baskets to pick up another load of sulphur . 'Stone and ceramic pipes cap the fumaroles, and inside the sulphur condenses into a molten red liquid, dripping back down and solidifying into pure sulphur. 'Miners hack chunks off with steel bars, braving extremely dangerous gases and liquids with minimal protection, then load up as much as they can carry for the more than three kilometres to the weighing station. 'Loads can weigh up to 90kg, and a single miner might make as many as two or three trips return in a day. Risky: The miners endanger their lives with the work on the slopes of an active volcano . Picturesque: But the landscape is less welcoming for the miners who work there every day . Meeting: Miners gather by the weighing station to work out how much they are owed . Chilling out: A miner enjoys a cigarette as he guards his valuable sulphur - the only way of making a living for some . 'The hills they walk through are high and steep, and very difficult terrain. When the rainy season comes, the job becomes very slippery and even more dangerous. 'At the end of a long day, miners take home approximately 50,000 rupiah (ÃÂ£3.40). The sulphur is then used for vulcanising rubber, bleaching sugar and other industrial processes nearby.' Among the industries which require the use of sulphur are fertilisers, cosmetics, insecticides and petroleum processing. It is also used to manufacture paper, paints, plastics, rubber, batteries, explosives and film. Spectacular: The view over the Ijen crater, with seams of sulphur on its sides and a lake in the centre . Industry: Sulphur is valued by manufacturers because of its versatile range of uses .

More than three decades after the deadly eruption of Mt St Helens in Washington state, an undeveloped roll of film resurfaced at a local newspaper containing never before seen images of the volcano on the eve of the deadly blast. The rare prints were discovered by a staffer at The Columbian. They were taken in 1980 by newspaper photographer Reid Blackburn, who perished while covering the eruption just weeks later. The black-and-white images showing the cauldron of the volcano belching out clouds of thick black smoke were captured by Blackburn from a helicopter in April. Discovery: This photo of a simmering Mount St. Helens was taken five weeks before the May 1980 eruption by The Columbian photographer Reid Blackburn, but it was never developed and forgotten until this year . Forgotten: Blackburn shot the photos from a helicopter during a flyover, but when he got back, he put the roll of film aside without processing it . Five weeks later, on the morning of May 18, 1980, the conical summit of Mt St Helens towering 9,600 feet above sea level burst open following an earthquake. Tragic death: Photojournalist Reid Blackburn, 27, was among the 57 people who perished in the blast . Within minutes, the north face of the symmetrical peak collapsed, spewing volcanic ash and unleashing rivers of hotÂ  mud and scorching pumice that obliterated everything in their path. The violent eruption lasted nine hours, causing catastrophic damage to the surrounding area and claiming 57 lives - among them The Columbian photojournalist Reid Blackburn. Blackburn, 27, was at Coldwater Camp when the explosion happened. His body was discovered four days later inside his car, which was buried up to the windows in ash. With the turmoil following the eruption, the deadliest of its kind in U.S. history, most people at the newspaper forgot about Blackburn's trip to the volcano five weeks prior. When he returned from the flyover in April, the young photojournalist set aside the roll of film he shot depicting the smoking conical summit. The undeveloped pictures had lingered in a film canister until the newspaperâs photo assistant Linda Lutes came upon it while going through a studio storage box in search of other images. The stunning discovery of the . long-lost prints came about after Lutes had received a request from a . geology book author asking her to find a certain photo from the day of . the eruption. The . staffer was unable to track down the print in question, but she did . stumble upon some of Blackburn's old negatives - and among them the . undeveloped roll of film. Caught by surprise: Blackburn's body was found four days later inside his car buried in several feet of volcanic ash . Catastrophe: The powerful blast sheared off the mountain's summit, sending piles of ash and rock into the air . When the historic black-and-white prints were finally processed, everyone at the paper was stunned to see Mt St Helens the way it looked 33 years ago, with its summit intact. Blackburn's widow, Fay, who still works for The Columbian, told the station KGW she was elated to discover one more piece of her late husband's legacy.","Photos were taken by Reid Blackburn from a helicopter five weeks before May 18, 1980, eruption .

Food and energy prices are rising faster in Britain than anywhere else in Europe as the crippling squeeze on household finances continues, a major report said yesterday. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said food prices in April were 4.6 per cent higher than in the same month last year, while energy prices were up 2.2 per cent. The rate of inflation in the UK was far higher than elsewhere in Europe and underlined the crisis facing families as they struggle to make ends meet. Food prices in April were 4.6 per cent higher than in the same month last year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . Inflation has been above the Bank of England's 2 per cent target since late 2009 as the cost of everyday essentials such as food soars. Household energy bills have also risen sharply in recent years â eating into household budgets at a time when wages are growing only very slowly, if at all. The increasing cost of living threatens to undermine the fragile economic recovery as consumers find themselves with less to spend each month. It also puts Britain at a disadvantage to the rest of Europe and the United States. The OECD said food prices were up 3.7 per cent in Germany in April, 1.6 per cent in France and just 1 per cent in the United States. The report from the Paris-based think tank said energy prices in Britain were rising at more than four times the rate seen in Germany. In nearly a dozen European countries energy bills fell in April â including in France, Belgium, Denmark and Spain. The OECD said the overall rate of inflation in Britain slowed from 2.8 per cent in March to 2.4 per cent in April. But this was still well above the 1.2 per cent seen in Germany, 1.1 per cent in Italy and 0.7 per cent in France and the Bank of England expects inflation in Britain to rise again in the coming months. The report came just a day after the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Britain's leading economic forecaster, said the average family with two children will be Â£1,800 worse off by 2015 than they were in 2008. Inflation has been above the Bank of England's 2 per cent target since late 2009 as the cost of everyday essentials such as food soars . While overall shop prices fell across the country in May, as retailers slashed prices in 'desperation sales', food prices continued to outpace increases in pay with a rise of 2.4 per cent, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). It said shop price inflation in May was -0.1 per cent â the first time there has been an annual fall in three-and-a-half years, but this was driven by non-essential items. The biggest falls were seen among fashion and shoe stores, where average prices were down by some 5.7 per cent. That means a coat that was reduced from Â£250 to Â£150 in a sale in 2012, would have been cut from Â£250 to around Â£140 in May this year. The study said the average price of electrical goods was down by 5.2 per cent in May against a year ago, largely because many tablets, TVs and other devices have come down in price amid fierce competition, particularly from online retailers. There were also price falls for furniture, carpets, DIY and gardening products. Helen Dickinson, the director general of the BRC, said: 'Times remain tough, but it seems retailers are reading the market well and doing what they can to offer customers the best possible value on their shopping.' Howard Archer, economist at researchers IHS Global Insight, said consumer spending over the coming months will be 'crucial to the economy's performance'. He added: 'Inflation is still likely to rise to around 3 per cent during the summer despite dipping to 2.4 per cent in April from 2.8 per cent in March.' Energy . price tariffs are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers . constantly battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd consumers can take advantage of . this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to . ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will . save you significant amounts. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. If you are one of the millions of . people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original . supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly . as much as Â£300 a year. Prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.","OECD said food in April was 4.6% dearer than same month last year .

One Korean food market in Glendale, California has enforced a heated new rule--customers may only purchase one bottle of the Sriracha each. Laist reports that HK Market is limiting Sriracha to one bottle per person because they are afraid they'll run out. Now that the quantity of the sweet and spicy chili sauce is growing less after the factory was partially shut down, demand for Sriracha is on the rise. Irwindale, California residents complained that the Sriracha Factory in their area created a spicy air that made their eyes burn, gave them coughing fits and headaches. The smell was such a 'nuisance' that Judge Robert O'Brien ordered Huy Fong Foods, Inc. to partially shut down their factory for the time being earlier this month. Hot on the market: HK market in California is rationing the hot sauce for fear they will run out . This Instagram user brags about having four bottles of Sriracha despite the 'Sirachapocalypse' Now, customers are ravenous for the popular chili sauce. '1 each' reads a sign on the Sriracha tubs HK market sells for $3.99 per container. Laist spoke with HK market earlier this morning to ask why they are rationing the Sriracha, and an employee said that they are 'afraid of running out.' The term, 'Sirachapocalypse' has become a popular term for the growing demand for Sriracha in the wake of the factory shutdown. On social media sites like twitter and instagram, 'Sirachapocolypse' has been deemed a concern among young 'hipsters' and possesses a kitsch value that's be come increasingly popular over time. Publications like Quartz have called Sriracha the 'coolest hot-sauce of all time' and pointed out the fact that Sriracha doesn't pay one cent on advertising their brand. Sriracha is 'too cool' for twitter, facebook page, or google plus--something that people on all of those media sites find alluring. Laist reports that Huy Fong started in Chinatown in 1980 but that he sold $60 million worth of hot sauce last year alone. The San Gabriel Valley Tribune reports that Sriracha supporters like restauranteur Eric Greenspan said, 'I don't see Sriracha disappearing.' Gabriel believes that the disappearance will help to boost the brand. 'I dont think anything's goig to stop their momentum,' he said. 'It's too darn hot.' Sirachapocalypse is here: Social media users comment on their love for the chili sauce . Sriracha has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially among the 'hipster' population . The Sriracha company had previously argued that there is no reason to close the plant now because harvest season and subsequent grinding of red-hot Jalapeno peppers, the sauce's key ingredient, has passed. That suggests that the injunction may not have a major immediate effect on the company's production or the nation's hot sauce supply as Huy Fong keeps up its year-round mixing and bottling. The judge acknowledged there was a 'lack of credible evidence' linking locals' complaints of breathing trouble and watering eyes to the factory. But he said the odor that could be 'reasonably inferred to be emanating from the facility' is, for residents, 'extremely annoying, irritating and offensive to the senses warranting consideration as a public nuisance.' Irwindale officials commended the decision. 'We believe it's a strong ruling that acknowledges and is reflective of the concerns that the community has raised about the health impacts of the odor,'City Attorney Fred Galante said. The case could still go to trial, but Galante said the city would like to see a settlement outside court, and does not want to shut down Sriracha altogether. 'We're going to try to keep having a conversation with Huy Fong,' Galante said, and hopes to find a collaborative way to 'make sure the odor problems are addressed.' Nobody ever goes in, nobody ever comes out: Now that the factory is partially closed, Sriracha's mystique is on the rise .

Now, a set of vintage photographs has revealed both the luxury cabins and the primitive technology that was used. The shots show passengers reclining in armchairs and eating delicious meals thousands of feet in the air. Plush: The spacious and beautifully appointed main cabin of a BOAC Boeing Stratocruiser allowed passengers to relax in comfort . Update: The idea of luxury has changed, with passengers favouring sleek white cabins . Plush cabins also provide a sharp contrast from the more sleek design used in air travel today. The photographs were release by British Airways, who also recreated the shots in a modern setting. A pilot sitting in a primitive cockpit is shown dressed in a uniform and pilot's cap and is compared with a modern aeroplane, featuring all the technology that is now used. During the pioneering early days at Heathrow military tents were pressed into service in the summer of 1946 to provide basic facilities for passengers using the newly-opened airport.

In-flight meal: British Airways business class still gives customers a taste of luxury, but the style is very different now . Pilot: A captain at the controls of a Handley Page HP42 airliner. The 38-seat aircraft first entered service with the airline on 11Â June 1931 on the route between London (Croydon) and Paris (Le Bourget) New technology: A British Airways captain looks more comfortable at the controls of an Airbus A320 . The airport featured a cable office and a W. H. Smith for the 620 passengers that passed through its doors every week. But now, British Airways alone carries an average of 650,000 customers per week through Heathrow Terminals 5, 3 and 1. In 1927, Imperial Airways, a predecessor to British Airways, introduced its âSilver Wingâ service from London to Paris, with luxury features such as in-flight catering and a steward. Celebration: Delivery to Heathrow on 30 September 1958 of BOAC's first De Havilland DH106 Comet 4 jet airliners .

Short-haul: The cabin of an Imperial Airways Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft . InÂ  1958 a De Havilland DH106 Comet 4 jet airliner was delivered to BOAC, which later merged with BEA to form British Airways. On October 4 1958, BOAC operated the first ever-transatlantic passenger commercial services in the world between London and New York. 55 years later, on July 4 2013, British Airways is taking delivery of the first UK operated Airbus A380 âSuperjumboâ. The luxurious aircraft will carry 469 passengers at a maximum speed of 587mph and will initially serve Los Angeles and Hong Kong. Aircraft: :A Bristol Britannia of BOAC at London Airport North.  BOAC's services moved progressively to Terminal 3 after it opened in 1961 . Cockpit: The spacious flight deck of a BOAC Boeing Stratocruiser, which first entered service with BOAC in 1949 . While commercial air travel took place as early as 1911, aeroplanes were unstable, small and could not reach high altitudes. But, in the interwar years, advances in technology saw stronger engines and better navigation, making flights safer for commercial passengers. The development of cabin pressurization in the early 1920âs also made it more comfortable for passengers, allowing then to travel to high altitudes without noticing any change. Post World War II light aircraft suitable for the mass market were developed, and thousands of trained pilots came out of military service. The famous Boeing 707 then became the first jetliner to be commercially successful, providing a comfortable experience for those who wished to fly. Air travel became more glamorous during the 1960s as while it was more affordable, it was still exclusive. Journeys were comfortable and plush, with food and drinks being served by stylish stewardesses. Concorde was developed in 1969, by the UK and France, making the journey between London and New York even quicker, but was discontinued in 2003 following the aircraftâs only crash. Now, with the introduction of budget airlines, millions of passengers enjoy travelling abroad with ease even though the style and mystique of mid-century air travel has disappeared.","The photos show passengers enjoying comfortable and luxurious aircrafts .

A wheelchair-bound football fan has become the worldâs first disabled coach in the able-bodied game after receiving a letter of praise from Sir Alex Ferguson. Sohail Rehman, 21, was born with spinal muscular atrophy which left him struggled to walk a few steps, and by 13 he was in a wheelchair. But a passionate football fan and player, he was determined not to let the condition push him out of the game. Groundbreaking: Sohail Rehman, 21, refused to abandon the sport he loved when he was put in a wheelchair aged 13 suffering from spinal muscular atrophy . Career path: He is now a coach for Sunday league matches and tournaments in Yorkshire . Honour: Hearing about Mr Rehman's goals, Sir Alex Ferguson (right), former Manchester United manager, wrote to encourage him. The letter (pictured right) praises Mr Rehman's goals and fearlessness . He studied sports technology at college, and spent the rest of his time pitch-side - at school and at Old Trafford with the Manchester United disabled supporters association. Two years ago, a letter arrived at his home in Keighley, near Leeds, from former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, and it sealed his ambition. Mr Rehman said: 'When the chance to play was taken away from me I think it was the only option I had really. 'I could watch the game but I always wanted to do more than watch it. 'I . did it all the way up to college and then once I got to college they . said to me you know so much about sports why donât you do sports. Mr Rehman admits he questioned his own ability to coach players as he cannot play the game himself . But he now believes his analysis is strong enough to get him into the Premier League . 'I . decided to take them up on that and do sports and then gradually . through the sports development course at college I decided to take my FA . badges and then basically got into it full time. 'I had a little bit of doubt before . about coaching at that high level obviously having never played the . game at a certain level, but when I got a letter from Sir Alex that . was the final piece in the jigsaw. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that causes muscle weakness and progressive loss of movement. It occurs due to deterioration in the nerve cells (motor neurones) connecting the brain and spinal cord to the bodyâs muscles. As the link between the nerves and muscles breaks down, the muscles that are used for activities such as crawling, walking, sitting up, and moving the head become progressively weaker and shrink (atrophy). Mental abilities are unaffected by SMA. The most common form is caused by a genetic problem where one copy of the genetic error is inherited from each parent. 'He congratulated me on my coaching badges and for the kind of goals I had in mind. 'It was a big honour, he is one of the biggest men in football. 'Iâm going for it now, nothing will stop me.' Starting his career, Mr Rehman will coach Sunday league teams and tournaments in Yorkshire but plans to rise to the top - with Manchester United in his sights. He added: 'I donât coach a professional team yet, its just Sunday league stuff at the moment. 'My dream job is probably to manage the biggest clubs in the world. I would want to manage. 'Any . coach or manager who says he is just coaching Sunday League just for . the fun of it is lying, because every coach wantâs to coach at the . highest level. 'Thatâs the way I am, I want to coach the Manchester Uniteds, the Real Madrids. Thatâs my aim.' Mr Rehman, a Manchester United supporter, admitted he often questioned his own ability while training at Leeds City College. He . said: 'In the early stages you always have that question, how do you . know when youâve never played the game? But I think, in the end of the . day, they have the right to ask that. 'I . look at it like there are some managers out there who havenât played . the game, or they played the game at a low level not a high level, like . Jose Mourinho. 'The other . drawback is obviously I canât demonstrate what I want to teach. I get . fully into it though, I analyse want I want them to do and go into it . with them. 'I always work . round a problem and find a way of doing it. I probably am a lot more . descriptive than other coaches, there is a lot more planning going into . it really. Mr Rehman, from Keighley, near Leeds, was born with spinal muscular atrophy, which breaks the connection between muscles and nerves . There are some practical problems like getting stuck in the mud but he doesn't mind . 'There are some . practical problems as well, you have a wheelchair and muddy pitches to . deal with. That would stop any other person in a wheelchair, but not me. 'It gets stuck but I just dig it out and get on with it, you just get in the zone. 'Now Iâve been told I am the worldâs first wheelchair bound football coach for an able bodied team.'","Sohail Rehman, 21, was born with spinal muscular atrophy, which forced him into a wheelchair by the age of 13 .

An influential segment of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government is demanding stiffer controls on the influx of Romanians and Bulgarians expected to swarm into Germany after the New Yearâs Day veto on eastern European jobseekers expires. The demands by the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the centre-right party of Bavaria in power with Angela Merkel's CDU - mirror those of many UK politicians fearful of the waves of economic refugees placing yet more burdens on struggling health and social welfare services. For the past year many German cities have pleaded for understanding from the central government as Romanians and Bulgarians âghettoizeâ parts of their communities, particularly in Duisburg, Dortmund and other cities of the former industrialised Ruhr region. Stiffer controls: The Christian Social Union (CSU), an influential segment of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government, is demanding tighter controls over the number of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants expected to enter after the New Year's Day veto . Now the CSU has triggered a fierce national debate with the release of a weekend paper demanding a tougher course against âpoverty migrantsâ from those EU members states expected to arrive in huge numbers as they now achieve full labour rights. The CSU wants in particular to limit their access to the generous provisions of the German welfare state. In the CSU paper it says: âThe continued abuse of European freedom of movement due to poverty immigration threatens not only the acceptance of free movement of citizens but brings municipalities to the limits of their financial performance.â 'Ghettoizing' Germany: Many German cities have pleaded for understanding from the central government as Romanians and Bulgarians 'poverty migrants' move to communities such as Duisburg and Dortmund (file photo) The CSU wants the government to adopt the phrase: âWhoever cheats is sent packing.â The Institute for Employment Research (IAB) predicts that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians in Germany could rise from 100,000 to 180,000 in 2014. About 370,000 citizens from both countries currently live in Germany. In the average wage table for the EU the two countries rank in the last two places. Many Romanian and Bulgarian citizens who travelled to Germany in the past year circumnavigated welfare rules by claiming child benefits for as many as 14 children in a single family and by men falsely claiming self-employment to take jobs undercutting poorly paid natives. The CSU recommends a three month suspension from accessing social services for the first three months of residence and an efficient system whereby people who are expelled for cheating the welfare system are placed on some kind of register to prevent re-entry.

Passengers on a crossing from Newcastle to Amsterdam complained of being 'treated like animals' as the DFDS vessel King Seaways returned to port . Fights reportedly broke out as passengers were forced to cram on to outer decks for safety . Two men were arrested in connection with the incident â a 26-year-old on suspicion of arson and a 28-year-old on suspicion of affray. It is believed that the fire started in a cabin when a drinker dropped a lit cigarette on his bedding after falling asleep on Saturday night. RAF rescue helicopters were scrambled as crew members tackled the blaze and passengers were forced to evacuate their cabins. Some children were left shivering outside without their shoes and socks as they had been sleeping when the alarm was raised and passengers complained of their treatment. âWe were treated like animals on that boat,â said Joe Hilton, 22, a sports student from Billingham, Co Durham. âI was traumatised, I havenât slept all night. We didnât get any food until about seven this morning.â Chris Johnson, 27, an engineer from Rochdale, Lancashire, accused the crew of failing to keep passengers informed. âThe staff wouldnât tell us anything,â he said. âI was panicking and so was my girlfriend.

A further 17 people were treated by the ferry doctor. Many of the 946 passengers had been planning to spend New Year in Amsterdam but have been forced to abandon their holidays after being taken back to Newcastleâs ferry port at North Shields. They have been offered refunds for their ferry tickets, but it is unclear whether they will be entitled to further compensation for their ruined trips. The fire broke out at 10.45pm on deck 5 while the ferry was about 30 miles off Flamborough Head in Yorkshire. Crew members extinguished it quickly but the captain decided to turn back as a precaution. Witnesses said that when they first heard the emergency alarms, they thought it was a joke â with some even singing the theme tune to the Titanic.

M&S faced a massive backlash yesterday after introducing the policy for the first three days of the sales. One person wrote on Twitter that the strategy was âsuicideâ and said it would drive away shoppers at a time when high street stores were already struggling. Others pointed out that by closing the changing rooms the store was throwing away one of the few advantages it has over internet shopping.

Former NYPD commissioner Bernard Kerik has accused his former attorney of working with federal agents to put him behind bars in 2010 for taking bribes from mobsters. Kerik, a 9/11 hero, was one of the city's most beloved commissioners and on track to be the head of Homeland Security but that changed the day he plead guilty to accepting $165,000 in apartment renovations from the mob-connected DiTommaso family who wanted a city contract. He hired high-profile lawyer and personal friend Joe Tacopina to represent him but by the time the case made it to court, his attorney was serving as a witness for the prosecution. Betrayed: Former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik (left) is suing his former attorney Joe Tacopina (right) for working with federal prosecutors behind his back . Career over: Kerik nearly became President Bush's director of Homeland Security but lost the opportunity when the organized crime connections surfaced . Kerik served four years of prison time in Maryland and was released this past May seemingly hell bent on vengence since he filed a bar complaint against Tacopina Friday. In the complaint, Kerik accuses Tacopina of engaging in 'conduct involving dishonest, fraud, deceit, and/or misrepresentation' in addition to several legal abuses. He says that Tacopina met with federeal prosecutors behind his back, giving them information that would help bring him down. Additionally Tacopina put Kerik in danger of being arrested by contacting him after it was announced that he would be on the witness list. Connections: Kerik pleaded guilty to accepting $165,000 in home renovations from Frank (left) and Peter (right) DiThommaso, from an organized crime connected family . Kerik also accuses Tacopina of attempting to defraud him of a seven-figure finder's fee in a real estate transaction. Steroid use: Tacopino is currently representing Yankee star Alex Rodriguez as he seeks to get his 211-game ban reduced . Following the new complaint, Tacopina shot back at Kerik in the New York Post calling the allegations unsubstantiated old news. 'This is such bulls***, reheated dog food,' Tacopina said. Tacopina's attorney was a little less candid with his denials. 'If any of these allegations were true, Mr Tacopina would have at least been subjected to discipline,' Washington-based attorney Lanny Davis said in a statement to the New York Daily News. 'Yet Mr Tacopina in 22 years of law practice has never received a bar complaint, let alone any discipline. Mr Tacopina's spotless record with the bar speaks far louder than the lies and innuendo that are being spread by those with an obvious agenda.' Tacopina is currently representing Yankee star Alex Rodriguez as he attempts to get his 211-game ban for testing positive for steroid use reduced. Boston attorney Raymond Mansolillo is representing Kerik in the bar case, and says his client may also file a malpractice suit against Tacopina. 'We'll assess the information that we've gleaned and we'll determine which avenue to take. I'm looking into whether any (of Tacopina's representation) had any direct effect on where Bernie ended up.'","Former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik plead guilty to accepting $165,000 from a mob-connected family in 2006 .

A crackdown on taxpayersâ money being used to fund union work by civil servants is today exposed as a dismal failure. The cost of âfacility timeâ in Whitehall shot up by almost a third in two years, according to official figures. What has been dubbed a âscandalous subsidyâ increased from Â£18.3million in 2010/11 to almost Â£23.6million in 2012/13 - a rise of 29 per cent. Limits: Fifteen government departments failed to meet a cap set by the Cabinet Office . Fifteen government departments failed to meet the cap set by the Cabinet Office of 0.1 per cent of the wages bill being spent on union time. Facility time allows trade union representatives to take paid time off to participate in union duties. But critics say it means taxpayers are providing unions with a huge activist base to support strikes and freeing up resources for political campaigns. Before the curb was introduced in 2010, there was no monitoring of the subsidy among civil servants â with some working full time on union duties and others even receiving promotions without actually doing the job for which they were paid. Tory MP Dominic Raab, who uncovered the figures under freedom of information laws, said: âWith so many facing the disruption of strikes led by militant union leaders, taxpayers will be alarmed to learn their subsidy to the unions has shot up by almost a third in two years. 'Having pledged to cut the millions of pounds of public money siphoned off for union business, it is vital that the Government delivers on its promise.â Uncovered: Dominic Raab MP found out the figures using freedom of information laws . The figures are based on data from 16 Whitehall departments and 37 executive agencies. As 20 departments were sent requests, the estimate is almost certainly below theÂ  actual spend on facility time. The biggest spenders were the Ministry of Justice, which charged taxpayers almost Â£6.5million. The Department for Work and Pensions spent Â£6.1million, while the Ministry of Defence topped Â£3.3million. The DWP also saw one of the biggest rises in spending over the two years, with a Â£5.68million or 1,350 per cent increase. Ministry of Justice expenditure leaped by Â£726,610 - 13.4 per cent - while spending by the Home Office rose by Â£646,786 (25.9 per cent). At present, 0.26 per cent of the Civil Serviceâs pay bill is spent on union work. The equivalent figure is just 0.04 per cent in the private sector. The TaxPayersâ Alliance campaign group has led calls for a cut in the subsidy, which it claims is actually worth Â£80million to unions across the entire public sector. But the National Association of Head Teachers said facility time saves taxpayersâ money by preventing conflicts and tribunals, and promoting training and development. The Trades Union Congress says the public and private sector save Â£2million a day. A Cabinet Office spokesman said newer figures will show costs falling âdramaticallyâ. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'Before 2010 there was no monitoring of taxpayer-funded union representatives and too many civil servants worked full time on nothing but union work. 'Some civil servants were even promoted without doing the job for which they were employed. That is not fair to the taxpayer or other civil servants. 'Our policy now limits the amount of time civil servants can spend on trade union work. 'We will be looking closely at this data as it seems totally at odds with the recent numbers reported by departments. 'Because there was no systematic monitoring before the last election, in some cases reported numbers have seemed to increase but what actually happened is that departments more accurately monitored their workforces as a result of our policy. 'Our newest figures, which will be published shortly, show the cost of facility time has fallen dramatically.'","The cost of âfacility timeâ in Whitehall shot up by almost a third in two years .

Conservationists are fighting to save a native plant that is growing wild in only one site in Cornwall. There are only 13 Lizard junipers in the Gew Graze Valley on the Lizard Peninsula and they are failing to regenerate. A team from the Eden Project and Natural England are now growing specimens at a nursery and hope to plant them in the wild in the coming year. Rare: The Lizard juniper, a rare variant of the more ordinary juniper bush, pictured, is in danger of dying out . The Lizard juniper was historically recorded at several sites on the Lizard Fire, grazing by animals, reduction in fertility by ageing plants and male and female fragmentation are believed to be behind the decline. In the last 30 years regeneration rates are believed to have been very low - in 2010, detailed surveys found no natural regeneration at all. John Martin, from Natural England, said the people of Cornwall should be 'very proud of the Lizardâs botanical importance'. It has a number of rare species. Cuttings from all known wild juniper plants on the Lizard were taken in 2010 to the Eden Project in Cornwall. Fruit was collected from five wild female plants two years later with the aim to grow plants from the seeds. Both methods are now being used to help grow junipers. 'The 13 individuals live close together [in the wild] and we want to see if former sites where they used to be found might be suitable for the reintroduction,' Mr Martin said. 'It will help protect them if something bad happens to those in the Gew Graze Valley.' Growth: Campaigners from the Eden Project, pictured, are trying to grow new specimens in a nursery . Dr Tim Pettitt, from the Eden Project, said seedlings had been germinated from the collected seeds, but they had to be 'robust enough' before being reintroduced. 'Itâs part of our native flora and we need to do more to understand why there has been such a strong decline,' he said. 'The species was once abundant and we should endeavour to keep it.' The plant is a subspecies of the juniper, an evergreen conifer. Mr Martin said the Lizard was the only place in the UK where it was found. But he admitted there was some divide in the scientific community as to whether a type of juniper found in southern Europe was the same subspecies. He said: 'They live in different habitats, there would be no gene flow between the two populations, and they do differ, but at this stage itâs unclear whether it is the same subspecies or not.' Dr Alistair Griffiths, who is one of the founders of the project, said: 'Itâs a very important project, not just for conserving one population of plants, but also understanding the scientific methods of how best to protect our habitats and plants.' He added the research methods used for the Lizard juniper, as a case study, could help towards safeguarding other species.","There are only 13 Lizard junipers left on the the Lizard Peninsula .

The move into employment will mean an end to out-of-work benefits for most and a boost to the Coalitionâs drive to cut the welfare bill. However, while they may no longer receive payments such as Jobseekerâs Allowance, Employment Support Allowance or Incapacity Benefit â they could still qualify for the Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments, which take into account the higher costs many disabled people face in everyday life. More than 500 disabled people are starting jobs every week, according to the Government . The crackdown on sickness benefits has been criticised by disability campaigners, who have accused the Government of doing little to help claimants into work. Disabled people are still farÂ  more likely to be unemployed than others of working age. In 2012,Â  only 46.3 per cent of working-age disabled people were in jobs compared to 76.4 per cent of non-disabled people. But the Department for Work and Pensions has pointed to grants, mentors and job placement schemes it has established to help those with disabilities. Ministers want to tackle the negative attitudes of some employers who wrongly believe that hiring someone with disabilities would be too complicated. The Government this month launched its disability employment strategy to look at what else can be done for both employers and those with disabilities to get more people into work. More than 78,000 disabled people have been helped into jobs through such schemes since 2011.

The rate of unemployment rose to 7.8 per cent. Total pay including bonuses from January to March was up just 0.4 per cent on the same period in 2012, the Office for National Statistics. The rise was entirely fuelled by increase state-funded jobs, with employees in the private sector seeing no year-on-year increase in pay at all. The figure for March alone showed a fall in pay of 0.4 per cent, the first negative since March 2009.The Consumer Prices Index, which tracks the annual rise in the cost of living, stands at 2.8 per cent. It means wage rises are failing to cover rises in bills for food, housing and shopping leaving people worse off every month. Labour MP Catherine McKinnell said in the Commons yesterday: 'Average earnings are rising at the lowest rate since the end of 2009.' She pointed to a study by the Resolution Foundation, that warned the squeeze on average incomes is set to continue for many years. 'The foundation estimates that... the gap between what people earn and what they would have been earning had their wages risen in line with inflation will have risen to Â£3,200 by 2017.' Average earnings excluding bonuses rose by 0.8 per cent, the lowest rise since records began in 2001. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: âThose in work are taking a hammering in their pay packets with wage growth down to just 0.4 per cent, while prices rise far more quickly.âIt's no wonder the economy is struggling when people in work are getting poorer every month.â After rising for previous quarters, the fissures showed a surprise fall in the overall rate of unemployment to 0.8 per cent . The figures also revealed that the number of people in work fell by 43,000 in the latest quarter to March, to 29.7 million, the biggest fall since autumn 2011. Some 902,000 people had been out of work for more than a year, a 23,000 increase on the three months to December. The number of unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds fell by 17,000 to 958,000. The government claimed there were now more than half a million job vacancies in the UK, the highest number since 2008. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefit Jobseekers Allowance in April fell to its lowest level since May 2011, but still stands at 1.52million. The drop in employment by 43,000 was blamed on a fall in part-time workers and government training schemes. The number of people in full-time jobs rose by 10,000 on the quarter. Employment minister Mark Hoban said: 'There are record numbers of women in work, fewer young people unemployed and more vacancies available for those looking for work. Labour's Liam Byrne accused Tories of bickering over Europe while families were struggling . 'We are also seeing continuing falls in the number of people claiming Jobseekerâs Allowance which is positive. Whilst there has been a disappointing increase in the headline rate of unemployment, we shouldn't forget the progress we are making. 'We are not complacent. To win the global race we need to do all that we can to help people achieve their aspiration to look after themselves and their families.' The number of people classed as economically inactive, including students, people on long-term sick leave and those who have given up looking for work, rose by 47,000 to nine million. Despite today's increase in unemployment, the total is 92,000 lower than a year ago. The unemployment rate from January to March was 7.8 per cent, down from 7.9 per cent in December to February. Liam Byrne, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: âWe now have definitive proof the Government has simply failed to get Britain back to work.â He said the Government had done nothing in the Queen's Speech to help solve the âjobs crisisâ and instead Tory MPs were bickering over Europe. âFamilies struggling for work will be asking quite simply, what planet are these people on?â However, Neil Carberry, director of employment and skills for the CBI, said: âGiven the challenging economic conditions at the end of last year, it's unsurprising that we're now seeing fewer people in work. âWhat's encouraging, however, is that economic conditions seem to be improving and that full-time jobs are still being created.â Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: âFollowing recent positive news on the economy, today's UK labour market data provides something of a reality check. âThere was a triple whammy of bad news, with employment in the three months to March down by 43,000 and unemployment up by 15,000.

Four bosses at Starbucks have walked away with Â£50million in pay despite the coffee chain having paid no corporation tax in Britain over the past three years, it has been reported. Documents filed on the firmâs website show the quartet managed to receive handsome fees over the past three years as well as owning shares worth a combined Â£563.7million. While Starbucks has been trading healthily in recent times, it has managed to post a profit from its UK business only once in 15 years, according to reports. Starbucks has been trading well but pays little in UK tax because of legal accounting techniques . And it has paid a total of just Â£8.6million corporation tax in 14 years, with nothing in the last three. Some . of this is due to the legal practice of writing off the costs of . growing a business against tax, and the payment of royalties for the use . of technology to a parent company. But the firm has been able to pay handsome wages to its most senior staff over the past three years. It . was reported that finance chief Troy Alstead, who owns Â£6.8million of . shares, was paid Â£5.7million, and founder Howard Schultz Â£33million â he . also owns shares, worth Â£545million. Paid handsomely: UK director John Culver was paid Â£3.8million over two years and owns Â£4.7million in shares . Ex-UK boss Cliff Burrows who now oversees the firmâs Americas operation and has shares worth Â£7.2million, earned Â£6.5million. UK director John Culver was paid Â£3.8million over two years and owns Â£4.7million in shares. Last week Starbucks, Amazon and Google were slammed over measures they have taken, within the law, to reduce their tax liabilities. Ex UK boss Cliff Burrows now oversees the firm's Americas operation and has shares worth Â£7.2million. He earned Â£6.5million over the past three years . Bosses of the three giants were grilled by MPs over how they managed to pay little or no corporation tax on their UK operations. All three denied they were engaged in aggressive tax avoidance. Business secretary Vince Cable yesterday indicated that action can be expected from Chancellor George Osborne, who delivers his Autumn statement on December 5. Speaking on BBC1, Mr Cable told The Andrew Marr Show: âOur own tax authorities have got to be very tough on things like royalty payments, which is where a lot of the subterfuge takes place.â He said it was âcompletely unacceptable where there is systematic abuse taking placeâ. Howard Schultz was paid Â£33million on top of the Â£545million worth of shares he already has . âStarbucks claims they are actually making losses in the UK,â he added. âI donât know whether they are or not. But you would need some pretty intensive investigation by the Inland Revenue to establish what exactly is going on, whether their transfer prices and their royalties are being fiddled or not.â Last week Andy Street, managing director of John Lewis, warnedÂ  that firms based in overseas tax havens could âout-invest and ultimately out-tradeâ rival businesses paying full taxes in the UK. A Starbucks spokesman said: âCorporation tax is a tax on profits and although we would very much like to and are moving in the right direction, we just donât make a profit in the UK yet. Finance chief Troy Alstead, who owns Â£6.8million of shares, was paid Â£5.7million . âStarbucks does however pay a number of other taxes in the UK. For example, we directly contribute more than Â£25million to Â£30million per year to the Exchequer in various taxes, including employersâ National Insurance contributions and business rates.â HM Revenue and Customs has nearly doubled its estimate of unpaid tax on executive pay to up to Â£400million, compared with last year. Bosses at Britainâs 700 largest businesses are being investigated using new powers. Jason Collins, a partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: âHMRC has increased its focus on executives.â","The quartet also own shares worth a combined Â£563.7million .

Britain's biggest solar farm - large enough to power 11,000 homes - is to be built on the south coast after councillors approved the plans. The 200 acre site will be positioned between Waterlooville, Hants, and Fareham, Hants. The current largest solar farm in the UK is at Wymeswold Airfield in Leicestershire, Mids, at 150 acres. A New 200 acre solar farm is to be built in Hampshire, and is 50 acres larger than the current record holder . The plans, submitted by Hampshire's Southwick Estate, will see the loss of agricultural land, which has been farmed for three generations. But the scheme was given the go ahead by nine out of ten councillors on the Planning Development Control Committee at Winchester City Council. Councillor Therese Evans, who was the dissenting voice, said: 'I fear it will set a precedent because they are taking up so much of a farm. 'I feel you have to be very careful about setting a precedent for a lot of fields. 'There are three which are currently being used successfully for agricultural farming, and have been for generations. 'Although I see the importance of renewable energy, I do still think it is important to retain agriculture as much as possible where it's viable.' Pressure group the Campaign to Protect Rural England, also objected to the ambitious plans. The land has been farmed by the Cutler family for three generations. But current tenant farmer Neil Cutler said he supports the proposals and will work with the estate and solar farm providers to ensure its success. The family will also be compensated for the loss. Councillors in Hampshire approved the scheme despite the loss of of agricultural land which has been farmed for three generations (file picture) A consultation was held in August this year and the majority of the responses were also positive. Hampshire co-ordinator for Friends of the Earth Ray Cobbett welcomes the plans. He said: 'It is another step on the long road to sustainable energy resources in south Hampshire and we welcome it. 'A calculation has to be made as to the best use of the land and that is down to the landowner and the local planning authority.' Solar farm providers Hive Energy and Welborne Solar are supporting the plans. Hive Energy chief executive Giles Redpath said: 'We are delighted to be working with Southwick Estate on this prestigious project. 'We are both committed to creating one of the UK's largest solar parks, which will be almost invisible from public areas, will support local ecology, will increase biodiversity and will deliver much-needed green electricity into the Portsmouth area for the next 25 years.'","New 200 acre site to be built in Hampshire countryside .

Love conquers all and that's certainly the case for Iraq War veteran Tomas Young, who had wanted to end his life after being left paralyzed by a sniper's bullet in 2004. The 33-year-old, who was left quadriplegic after medical complications, had said at the start of this year that he was in too much pain to live anymore. But the support and love of his caregiver-turned-wife Claudia Cuellar has given Mr Young a more positive outlook. Power of love: Tomas Young and wife Claudia, who he says has giving him the strength to stay alive . 'I just came to the conclusion that I . wanted some more time with my wife. And I . decided that I really don't have the chutzpah to go ahead and do away . with myself,' he told NPR. His change of heart shows how much has changed for Mr Young in the space of a year. In March he announced that he intended to refuse food, saying: âI'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.' Since the fateful day he was hit by a sniper's bullet in Iraq's Sadr City, the soldier turned anti-war campaigner has been in chronic pain. Medical complications after the initial injury resulted in him becoming quadriplegic, and a pulmonary brain embolism in 2008 made him less mobile. 'I decided that I was no longer going to watch myself deteriorate,' Mr Young said earlier this year. But, with the New Year approaching, the 33-year-old said his 'amazing wife' who he married in April 2012, has given him reason to live. In sickness and in health: Tomas and Claudia, who was his caregiver, married in April 2012 . Devoted: The couple say they now just want to celebrate their life together . 'Since she's come into my life, I'm happier than I've ever been and I want to leave her alone for as short a time as possible ... I love her and my love for her is stronger than my desire to kill myself,' he told ABC's Nightline. Earlier this month his wife thanked Robert Miltenberger for saving her husband. He was sat next to Mr Young when he was shot, and kept him alive by pressing on the wounds while they still under fire. The men hadn't seen each other since 2004, but as they were reunited Ms Cuellar said: 'You saved him' as she explained that the couple would never have met if it hadn't been for Mr Young's injuries. 'It's been a very difficult journey but sometimes the hardest journey you learn the most ... if there wasn't love, this wouldn't be possible,' she said. Ms Cuellar added: 'We just want to celebrate our life. It's hard, but it's not sad.' All you need is love: Claudia, pictured with Tomas, says their journey together has been hard but not sad . Injured: Tomas, pictured in 2007, was hit by a sniper's bullet in Iraq in 2004 . The couple, who live in Portland, Oregon, will see in the new year with a party at the Portland Art Museum. Mr Young, who . famously . wrote an open letter to Bush and Cheney chastising them for going to war . on Iraq, hopes his change of heart will encourage others who may be . feeling low. 'If you're in life and you start to . think things are a little too rough to handle just think of . me and what I go through, and you realize that ""Hey, I don't have it so . bad"",' he said.","Tomas Young says he is glad he changed his mind about taking own life .

A woman who joined the RAF after finishing university has been promoted to the highest military rank to be held by a female in Britain. Sue Gray, 50, has been made an Air Vice-Marshal - equivalent in seniority to a Major General in the Army or a Rear Admiral in the Royal Navy. She is only the second female two-star officer in the UK's Armed Forces. She has been appointed a director at the Defence Equipment and Support and will be responsible for buying and maintaining all fighter jets, training aircraft and drones. Air Vice-Marshal Gray follows in the footsteps of Air Vice-Marshal Elaine West, 51, who became director of projects and programme delivery at the Defence Infrastructure Organisation in August. She joined the RAF in 1985 after gaining a degree in electronics from Newcastle Upon Tyne Polytechnic. Commissioned as an engineer, she has climbed through the ranks during a 28-year career. She has twice served on the frontline in Iraq, in the First Gulf War in 1991 and again in 2003 as chief engineer for the Joint Helicopter Force.

A woman was beaten to death after a row with neighbours over her daughter's western clothing turned into a riot. Keshmal Dubey, 55, was killed after a long-running dispute over her daughter Gunjan's choice of jeans over traditional Indian clothing descended into mob violence in the city of Aligarh, 90 miles from New Delhi. Several people were injured in the trouble which started after a neighbour, named Pulwati, repeatedly criticised the 20-year-old college student's choice of dress. Riot: A 55-year-old woman was beaten to death in the poor Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, pictured, in a dispute with a neighbour over her daughter's western clothes . According to the Times, Aligarh police superintendent Amit Pathak said: 'The girl's neighbour would constantly pass comments on the way the girl dressed. 'On this occasion, she was in jeans and the woman, as usual, started passing comments. 'A fight ensued which grew ugly when the neighbour got other men to support her.' The girl's father, Netrapal Dubey, told India Today that the neighbour had asked him to stop his daughter wearing the jeans because it made her sons stare at the girl. He said that she warned him that Gunjan was at risk of being sexually harrassed, or 'Eve-teased' as it is known in India, by young men. Mr Dubey claims that a mob of men carrying guns and clubs forced their way into the family home and hit his wife over the head with a rifle butt, killing her and injuring him and his daughter. Conservative dress: Neighbours repeatedly criticised the 20-year-old student for not wearing a traditional sari, like those pictured . The trouble was eventually diffused when fellow neighbours stepped in to halt the violence. A man and a woman were arrested according to police and face charges of murder and attempted murder. Police are still trying to identify some of the other people involved. An elderly woman and her daughter-in-law were killed after neighbours in their eastern Indian village accused them of practising witchcraft. The gang, mainly made up of women according to police in Jharkhand, are said to have beat the women, aged 70 and 42, to death. District police chief Rakesh Bansal said that 19 women from Karonda Jor village have been arrested. The women were killed on Tuesday night about 85km north of state capital Ranchi, according to the Telegraph. Violence broke out after villagers decided to fine the pair for practising witchcraft at a village meeting but spent the collected R1,500 on alcohol. Crimes mainly against women accused of black magic remain a problem in India, particularly in poorer regions. A year ago a father and his two teenage sons were killed by villagers in the same district.

A blind schoolgirl whose growth has been stunted by a rare condition can now get around thanks to a specially made mini cane. At just 34 inches tall, five-year-old Lexi Drake struggled to get by using even the smallest of white sticks because they were too big for her. But her life has now been transformed thanks to the custom-made cane. Lexi Drake, five, had Turner syndrome which causes short stature and infertility. She also has a brain tumour which caused her to lose her sight when she was two years old . Lexi has Turner syndrome â a chromosomal abnormality which only affects girls and is caused by an abnormal sex chromosome. She is also blind as a result of suffering from a brain tumour which damaged the nerves in her eyes. Lexi, from Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, is one of just three known people in the world to suffer from the combination of Turner syndrome and a brain tumour. But she is adapting to life with her new 24 inch cane and started school in September. Her mother Anna, 25, said: âMost people moan if they have a headache and are struggling to get out of bed. But whatever she is faced with, she gets on with. âSheâs happy and smiley and full of energy. Sheâs always caring about everybody else. Lexi (pictured with her mother, Anna, and her mother's partner, James Bowler) was unable to have an off-the-shelf white cane as they are too long so a custom-made one was flown over from Canada for her . âYou hope for the best and I just take every day as it comes. The tumour hasnât grown back since her treatment.â Ms Drake, a mother-of-three,  said: âShe had a cane which was the smallest they had in the country, but it was still too big for her and that didnât even have the ball on it. âI had to get this one with the ball made for her in Canada. Since then, she has never looked back. âShe uses it at school and she has grown with it really well. âShe got it when she was four - she was the smallest in the country to have a white cane. Lexi (pictured learning to swim with her aunt, Chrissie Drake) is one of just three people in the world known to suffer from both Turner syndrome and a brain tumour . âI think now the blindness is part of Lexi. I would love her to wake up and say I can see but it is absolutely part of Lexi. âShe has adapted to it so well. She doesnât let her it get her down and she has lots of friends at school. She will talk to anybody.â Lexi was diagnosed with Turner syndrome at her mother's 15 week scan. The syndrome means she has part, or all, of one X chromosome missing. Sufferers can experience a range of physical problems as a result, including small stature and infertility. She also developed a rare brain . tumour, called craniopharyngioma, in 2010 and had to have keyhole . surgery to reduce the size of it. But it was unsuccessful and in March 2011 she travelled to America to receive pioneering treatment. Lexi (pictured in hospital with her aunt, Karen Grob) had to have keyhole surgery to remove her brain tumour. When this failed, she went to the U.S. for pioneering radiotherapy . Four metal screws were inserted into her head for six weeks while she underwent Proton Beam Therapy, a form of radiotherapy suited to tumours buried deep in the brain and spine because it causes less damage to healthy tissue. The treatment involved gruelling sessions, five days a week for 45 minutes, while the tumour was zapped with radiation to reduce its size. However, the treatment caused her to suffer strokes. âShe will need heart surgery because . she has a narrowing of the aorta but that will probably be when she is . about 10 years old,â Ms Drake, who lives with partner James Bowler, 25, . added. âAt the moment she is doing quite well with the tumour. âShe has regular scans every three to four months to look out for her health and any potential problems. âSheâs on growth hormone and in the last six months she has grown six centimetres.â Ms Drake says she wants Lexi to be independent and to feel she is no different to any other children . Lexi still has to undergo MRI scans to look for tumour regrowth, as well as scans to monitor her blood vessels to prevent any potential strokes. One of Lexiâs doctors from Birmingham Childrenâs Hospital praised her bravery throughout her ordeal. Martin . English, consultant paediatric oncologist at Birmingham Childrenâs . Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: âThere are only three cases of the . combined craniopharyngioma and Turner conditions reported in the world . and Lexi is one of those. âShe has coped incredibly well.

Turner syndrome is a genetic condition that only affects women. It is caused by an abnormal sex chromosome and affects about one in every 2,000 baby girls. Babies normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes including one pair which determine the baby's sex. These are known as the sex chromosomes. One sex chromosomes comes from the father and the other from the mother - the mother's is always an X chromosome, the father's can be an X or Y. A baby girl normally has XX and a boy has XY. In Turner syndrome, the Y is missing so the child is always a girl. The child also has part, or all, of one X chromosome missing meaning she has just one complete X chromosome rather than two. Most children with the condition are shorter than average and have underdeveloped ovaries. This means they are infertile and do not have periods. Some girls with the condition also have heart, kidney and thyroid problems. Turner syndrome is often not diagnosed until puberty as height and the lack of periods are the main symptoms. There is no cure for the condition but most people with it live a relatively normal life and their life expectancy is unaffected.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 23:26 EST, 14 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:29 EST, 14 June 2013 . The Associated Press obtained a report Friday that detailed the investigation into misconduct by the top official at the U.S. Military Academy. According to the report by Pentagon investigators, Lt. Gen. David Huntoon, the school's superintendent, didn't properly compensate workers at a charity dinner and used his position to obtain 'car care' among other things. The Department of Defense inspector general concluded that West Point superintendent Lt. Gen. Huntoon misused his position, government resources and personnel, according to a heavily redacted report released to The in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. West Point officials said they would not comment on the report, which said Huntoon took full responsibility and repaid the affected parties $1,815 based on prevailing labor rates. Review: A report obtained by the AP details the investigation into misconduct by Lt. Gen. David Huntoon, the superintendent of West Point . The report said the Army inspector general conducted a preliminary inquiry in 2010 into allegations Huntoon improperly allowed an employee to get government quarters at West Point based on a 'personal relationship' with her. The Army investigators determined those allegations were unfounded. The separate Pentagon investigation found Huntoon improperly used government personnel, accepted gifts of services from subordinates and misused his position. In the case of the charity dinner, workers were paid with $30 and $40 Starbucks gift cards, which investigators said was 'not sufficient.' Redactions in the report make it impossible to determine the complete nature of most episodes or details about the people involved in them. For example, the report says Huntoon misused his position to get cat-feeding help for a friend, but it was unclear who was feeding the cats and who the friend was. It also is unclear which relative or friend received driving lessons. Cats: One of the highlights of the report is that Huntoon misused his position in order to get 'cat-feeding services' for a friend . Improper pay: In one instance, Huntoon had workers at a charity dinner paid with $30 or $40 dollar Starbucks gift cards . Forced out?: Huntoon will be retiring this summer - something army officials deny is related to the 2010 investigation . Military officials first disclosed in April that an inspector general's investigation found Huntoon had engaged in misconduct, but they did not release specifics about the report. At that time, the Army said Huntoon had no pending disciplinary action against him. The report released Friday called for the secretary of the Army to 'consider appropriate corrective action' in regards to Huntoon. In a statement, an Army spokesman said the report was referred to the vice chief of staff of the Army, who is responsible for handling disciplinary actions. Lt. Col. Justin Platt said that on October 5, 2012, Huntoon was issued a 'written memorandum of concern, which admonished him for the improper use of subordinate personnel for unofficial purposes.' Platt said the report found that Huntoon improperly used two enlisted aides for unofficial functions at his headquarters and that a subordinate employee 'improperly provided driving lessons to a family member of LTG Huntoon.' Huntoon, a 1973 West Point graduate, will retire this summer after three years as superintendent. Army officials have said the retirement comes after 40 years of service and is not related to the investigation. The investigation into his actions was among a series of negative stories from the venerable academy on the Hudson River. An Army sergeant assigned to West Point was charged last month with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen women at the academy, including in a bathroom. And West Point's men's rugby team is temporarily disbanded after cadets forwarded emails that were derogatory to women.","Lt.

A call by the Childrenâs Commissioner for England for a total ban on smacking children has angered family campaigners. Maggie Atkinson said smacking children should be made illegal because it was akin to âphysical abuseâ, and the current law gave pets and adults more rights to protection from violence than youngsters. She sparked controversy by calling for a total ban which would see parents facing criminal action for corporal punishment. Maggie Atkinson said smacking children should be made illegal because it was akin to 'physical abuse', and the current law gave pets and adults more rights to protection from violence than youngsters . However, family campaigners claimed there were times when parents needed to smack young children because they were blatantly ignoring other punishments or warnings. Under current laws, it is illegal for a parent to smack a child if it leaves a bruise, but a lighter smack or âreasonable chastisementâ are allowed. Dr Atkinson said: âPersonally, having been a teacher, and never having had an issue where Iâd need to use physical punishment, I believe we should move to ban it. âIn law you are forbidden from striking another adult, and from physically chastising your pets, but somehow there is a loophole around the fact that you can physically chastise your child.â Dr Atkinson, who has two adult step-children, said that despite her strong feelings about the issue, her office was not planning to fight for a ban next year. However, family campaigners claimed there were times when parents needed to smack young children because they were blatantly ignoring other punishments or warnings . Phillip Noyes, of the NSPCC, said: âItâs right that we continue to push to get children equal protection in law. 'It would not be intended to criminalise good parents but to put into law what more and more parents are already moving towards â finding better ways than smacking to discipline their children.â But Margaret Morrissey, of family group Parents Outloud, branded Dr Atkinsonâs comments as âextremely irresponsibleâ. She said: âOf course nobody should thrash or beat or abuse a child but there are times when you have to show a child that the parameters have been passed. âChildren have to realise thereâs a limit beyond which you can go.â A Government spokesman said: âOur policy on smacking is clear.

Doctors pronounced Eva Casara, of Calumet City, dead at an area hospital Thursday morning. She had been shot in the back of the head Wednesday in Dolton. Dolton Police Chief John Franklin expressed condolences to the teen's family. He added that it's âunimaginable to lose a child on such a holy day.â Police say Casara was found fatally injured Wednesday evening lying in the snow between two houses in the south suburban community. She was around five-and-a-half months pregnant. No suspects were in custody Friday, but Franklin says there are solid leads in the case. According to Eva's grandmother, Fannie Casara, the teen stepped out of her home with a group of friends Wednesday afternoon saying she would be back shortly. But she never returned.

A gene variant that appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in some people can be traced back to Neanderthals. A team of researchers in Mexico and the U.S. have conducted the largest genetic study to date in Latin American populations. They discovered that people who carry a higher risk version of the gene are 25 per cent more likely to have diabetes that those who do not. Neanderthal genes are spread across the genome of all non-Africans, as humans interbred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago . Neanderthal genes are spread across the . genome of all non-Africans, as humans interbred with Neanderthals after . leaving Africa between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago. The gene variant was found as part of SIGMAâs (Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas) study of 8,000 Latin Americans, which sought to find a particular trait among individualsâ genes. People who carry the higher risk version of the gene - SLC16A11 - thought to have been passed down by ancient ancestors - are 25 per cent more likely to have diabetes. People who inherited copies of the variant from both their patents are 50 per cent more likely to have diabetes, according to the study published in Nature. SLC16A11 has been discovered in up to half of people with recent Native American ancestry, including Latin Americans and around one fifth of East Asians. However, it is rare in populations from Europe and Africa. The elevated frequency of this risk gene in Latin Americans could account for as much as 20 per cent of the populationsâ increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes - the origins of which are not well understood. People who carry the higher risk version of the gene - SLC16A11 - thought to have been passed down by ancient ancestors, are 25 per cent more likely to have diabetes, according to the study. Here, a doctor takes blood samples to analyse and detect diabetes . SLC16A11 is part of a family of genes that code for proteins that transport metabolites, which are molecules involved in chemical reactions in the body. Changing the amount of the SLC16A11 protein alters the amount of a type of fat implicated in the risk of diabetes. The findings of the study suggest SLC16A11 could be linked to the movement of a mystery metabolite that affects fat levels in cells - which can boost the risk of Type 2 diabetes. âTo date, genetic studies have largely used samples from people of European or Asian ancestry, which makes it possible to miss culprit genes that are altered at different frequencies in other populations,â said co-author JosÃ© Florez, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an Assistant Physician at the Centre for Human Genetic Research at the Massachusetts General Hospital. âBy expanding our search to include samples from Mexico and Latin America, weâve found one of the strongest genetic risk factors discovered to date, which could illuminate new pathways to target with drugs and a deeper understanding of the disease.' The researchers wanted to understand what they describe as the âunusual frequency patternâ for the variant of SLC16A11 and partnered with Svante PÃ¤Ã¤bo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology to discover that the variant is found in a newly sequenced Neanderthal genome. âAnalyses indicate that the higher risk version of SLC16A11 was introduced into modern humans through mixing with Neanderthal,â according to the study. The researchers' ultimate goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the genetic pathway to find new drugs for treating diabetes. Liptor, a medication that blocks the production of cholesterol in the body and is used to treat Type-2 diabetes, is pictured . Inheriting a gene from Neanderthal ancestors is not unusual, as around 2 per cent of the sequences present in all modern humans outside of Africa were inherited from Neanderthals who lived in what is now Europe and western Asia, between 400,000 and 30,000 years ago. However, scientists have only relatively recently realised the advantages and disadvantages of inherited genetic material from Neanderthals. David Altshuler, of the Broad Institute in Massachusetts and co-author of the study, said: âOne of the most exciting aspects of this work is that we've uncovered a new clue about the biology of diabetes.â âWe are now hard at work trying to figure out what is being transportedâ¦and what steps lead to the development of type 2 diabetes,â he added.

The Archbishop of Canterbury has warned David Cameronâs push for gay marriage will diminish the institution and weaken the family. In his first major intervention on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, the Most Rev Justin Welby said he could not support the legislation âas it standsâ. Despite their vocal opposition, bishops are set to abstain from a crunch vote on gay marriage in the House of Lords tonight. Warning: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the gay weddings laws effectively abolish marriage as an institution . The vote comes as sources said there had been pressure from Downing . Street on Church House, the headquarters of the Church of England. Last night, Archbishop Welby argued that same sex marriage âat its heart . is not a faith issue, it is about the general social goodâ. He added: âRather than adding a new and valued institution alongside it . for same gender relationships, which I would personally strongly support . to strengthen us all, this Bill weakens what exists and replaces it . with a less good option that is neither equal nor effective. âThe concept of marriage as a normative place for procreation is lost; . the idea of marriage as covenant is diminished; the family in its normal . sense, predating the state, and as our base community of society, as we . have already heard, is weakened.â Archbishop Welby expressed regret for the way the Church had treated homosexuals in the past . The Bill would not deliver equality because elements of the legislation . distinguish between same-sex and opposite-sex marriage, he argued. âThe . result is confusion. Marriage is abolished, redefined, and recreated, . being different and unequal for different categories.â He added that it was âwith much regret but entire conviction I cannot . support the Bill as it standsâ. Sources in the Lords said the Archbishop . was not expected to vote on the Bill. The Lords debate continues today after the Prime Ministerâs attempt to . legalise gay marriage was pushed through with the backing of Labour MPs . last month. All three main parties are giving their peers a free vote, but with more . Labour, Lib Dem and Tory peers in favour of the Bill, it is expected to . go through. Cross-benchers are likely to be split. Lord Dear, a former chief constable, urged peers to reject the . âill-consideredâ Bill and introduced a wrecking amendment to scupper it. âWe find ourselves in a world where an ill-conceived Bill seeks to . overturn centuries of tradition, heedless of public opinion and . religious leaders and blind to the laws of unintended consequences,â he . said. However, equalities minister Baroness Stowell of Beeston argued marriage . needed to be extended to same sex couples to remain sustainable. She said: âWe believe same-sex couples should be able to marry if they . want to and extending that choice is the right thing to do for them and . the right thing to do for the future of marriage,â she said.","Justin Welby warns marriage is abolished, redefined and recreated .

The names of a doctor and a nurse will be displayed above every hospital bed to stop patients being 'passed from pillar to post'. The move â announced today by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt â will allow patients and families to know where the buck stops. The idea of identifying individual doctors and nurses has all but died out after once being commonplace in the NHS. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for the names of a doctor and a nurse will be displayed above every hospital bed . Bringing it back was a key recommendation of the Francis inquiry into the deaths of hundreds of patients in the Mid Staffs scandal. Writing in today's Daily Mail, Mr Hunt says: 'A name you know and a face you trust to guide you throughout your stay can transform your experience. 'Robert Francis, who led the inquiry into Mid Staffs, said this was an important change that would help make sure such events never happened again. This year, we will ask every hospital to make it happen.' He said patients in hospitals that used the system 'didn't worry about being passed from pillar to post'. Campaigners complain that patients are often bewildered by repeated staff changes, which can also hamper continuity of care. The new system will not mean patients will see only one doctor or nurse throughout their stay â deemed impractical in a 24-hour Health Service that treats millions. Under the plans, individual doctors and nurses will be identified for patients so they know where the buck stops with their treatment . Instead, the named clinicians will act as a 'champion' for their care. They will also be the first point of contact for a patient or relative with any concerns â and the buck will usually stop with them. 'If things go wrong, obviously that will need investigation to see who was responsible,' said a Government source. 'So if a surgeon made a mistake, the named nurse wouldn't be held responsible. But they are the first port of call and accountable to patient and family for the overall hospital experience.' Other measures being introduced to improve patient care include a system to blacklist failed managers from taking further NHS jobs. The named clinician will be the first point of contact for a patient or relative with any concerns Â¿ and the buck will usually stop with them . This would end the 'merry-go-round' of executives who move from post to post despite a poor track record. The contracts of senior managers will in future include a clause linking their performance to the quality rating of their hospital. Incompetent bosses could then be sacked without big pay-offs. A new chief inspector will hand hospitals Ofsted-style ratings from outstanding to poor. Hospitals will additionally have to declare ward staffing levels. 'Every care setting is different and for . this to work effectively this must be something which is carefully . implemented, and supported by the right staffing levels.' Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing . The Government is introducing a new criminal offence for NHS staff who supply or publish false or misleading information â a change designed to prevent cover-ups. More senior consultants areÂ  to work at weekends and scanning departments will be kept open to try to improve care for patients treated on Saturdays and Sundays. Professor Norman Williams, president of The Royal College of Surgeons, said: 'The return to having the name of the responsible doctor and responsible nurse above every bed is welcomed. 'It is only right and proper that every patient knows who is accountable for their care. The surgeon is the advocate for the patient and this relationship is built on trust. 'We must do all we can to continue to deserve this trust by ensuring any problems are raised and addressed early. The surgeon-patient relationship will be further strengthened by the publication of information on the outcomes of surgery. 'This has been shown not only to improve surgical standards but to enable patients to have more informed conversations with their surgeon.' Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: 'The Health Secretary is right to focus on creating a supportive and transparent culture in the NHS. 'One of the RCP's key recommendations to the Francis Inquiry was that every patient should have a named consultant responsible for their care. 'We welcome this call from the Health Secretary, and also we believe it will help to improve patients' experience of healthcare.' Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said the new policy recognised that nurses were at the centre of patient care. However, he added: 'Every care setting is different and for this to work effectively this must be something which is carefully implemented, and supported by the right staffing levels.' By JEREMY HUNT, Health Secretary . Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt wrote in today's Daily Mail about his plans for the NHS . The Daily Mail has campaigned fearlessly in the last few years for greater accountability in our NHS. I'm determined this will happen in 2014. In the wake of Mid Staffs, we have introduced a tough new barring scheme to stop failed managers from popping up in other parts of the NHS, and we are passing a new law to make wilful neglect of patients a crime. But our plans for greater accountability are mainly about giving patients a guarantee of compassionate care. The NHS is one of the biggest employers and largest organisations in the world, but I am convinced it can still provide a personal service. Doctors and nurses enter healthcare out of a passion for helping people. For most, the personal interaction with patients and thrill of helping make people better is what brings real job satisfaction. For patients too, a human touch can make all the difference. A name you know and a face you trust to guide you throughout your stay can transform your experience. That's why we are committing to put the names of a responsible nurse and responsible doctor above every hospital bed. Robert Francis, who led the inquiry into Mid Staffs, said this was an important change that would help make sure such events never happened again. The medical royal colleges agree this is the type of thing that the best hospitals do for their patients. This year, we will ask every hospital to make it happen. A handful of our leading hospitals are already doing this. I've seen first hand at places like University College London Hospital and King's College Hospital what a difference this makes to patients. They don't worry about being passed from pillar to post between different departments on different days of the week, because they have one face and one name who champions their needs as long as they're in hospital. This is a key part of the wider change I'm trying to introduce in the NHS: insisting the buck stops with someone for every patient in every part of the NHS for every hour of the day. We are working to make sure that patients in hospital at the weekend can get to see senior doctors just like they can during the week. NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh has just announced that a greater number of senior doctors will work at weekends, and that X-ray, ultrasound, CT and MRI departments will be kept open. This year we have taken even bigger strides to make sure the buck stops with someone for patients outside hospital. Last month we tore up Labour's 2004 GP contract, which so disastrously broke the personal link between GPs and patients. Instead of being plagued by pointless targets, GPs will now use their time to provide proactive, personal care for elderly patients. Starting with the over 75s from this April, we are bringing back the named GPs that Labour abolished. This is a long overdue return to the family doctor. Whether they are in or out of hospital and whatever day or time it is, patients needÂ  to know who is responsible for lookingÂ  after them. The vast majority of patients in this country see the best doctors and nurses, in the finest hospitals, as part of the fairest health system in the world. By introducing individual accountability and increasing the personal, human touch, we will make it better still in 2014.","Campaigners complain patients are often bewildered by staff changes .

Routine hospital appointments for cancer survivors should be scrapped to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed by demand, according to a leading charity. Macmillan Cancer Support said the current system whereby most patients recovering from the disease are automatically booked for six-monthly check-ups was wasteful and did not target those most in need. Instead, doctors should identify those who require specialist support. 'Wasteful': Macmillan Cancer Support said automatically booking patients for six-monthly check-ups did not target those most in need (file picture) The time spent by hospitals on routine follow-up appointments has increased almost 10-fold since the 1970s, because of rising numbers of cancer cases and higher survival rates. There are two million people who are either living with the disease or have recovered from it. This number is expected to double by 2030, with the survival time for all cancers rising from just one year 40 years ago to almost six years on average. Patients are living longer due to factors such as timely diagnosis and new drugs. Ciaran Devane, the charity's chief executive, said many survivors are left with long-term health and emotional problems, and feel abandoned by the NHS. But the present system does not address these issues and fails to provide patients and GPs with information that could lead to recurrent cancers being detected promptly. Mr Devane said: 'The current follow-up appointments system is past its sell-by date. The health and social care services across the UK must radically transform how they deal with patients' aftercare, especially as the number of people getting and surviving cancer is soaring. 'Doctors need to be able to identify which patients need regular face-to-face appointments and specialist support, and which don't. The time spent by hospitals on routine follow-up appointments has increased almost 10-fold since the 1970s, because of rising numbers of cancer cases and higher survival rates . 'They also need to support cancer patients to develop the skills to manage their own conditions.' He added: 'The pressure on hospitals will only get worse. Cancer specialists will be overloaded if we continue with the current system, which is wasteful for the NHS and does not give survivors the support they actually need.' Death rates from cancer in Britain have fallen by more than a fifth since 1990. The charity said about one in five survivors was likely to benefit from regular follow-up appointments. But all needed to be given more information about symptoms that could mean the return of the disease, or other conditions associated with it. These were unlikely to be detected in routine check-ups. Two out of five people living with cancer are unaware of the long-term side effects of cancer treatment, according to the charity's research. It found just a third were give information about coping with the effects of the disease or treatment. Studies have found the risk of osteoporosisÂ  is doubled in prostate cancer survivors due to side effects from treatment.","Macmillan Cancer Support said the current system was wasteful .

But Jilly Cooper says modern women should be more willing to embrace the virtues of old-fashioned chivalry. The best-selling author criticised women for being too quick to âput men downâ with a constant bashing that has left them âbrow-beatenâ. Lasting love: Jilly Cooper, pictured with publisher husband Leo Cooper on their Golden Wedding Anniversary, said women are too quick to put men down . They often strip the opposite sex of their masculinity while they should be striving to encourage them to be real men, she said. Mrs Cooper, 76, said she hated the idea of metrosexual men âwearing pinniesâ on television, preferring males with a rugged Rock Hudson-style charm. She was asked by The Chap magazine to describe what a female âchapâ would be. In response she discussed how women should strive to enhance both sexes, making the most of the men in their lives. Women no longer tell men how great they are and instead look for ways to put them down, she said. âI think of my mother â who was very beautiful and very small â and she used to look up to men and say, âYou are amazing, you are cleverâ. âAnd I think thatâs whatâs gone wrong in the world for the male ego, when men are constantly being put down by women. âMy idea of a chappette is someone who enhances both sexes and is encouraging and just makes people happy. I just donât like people being put down.â Sex appeal: When asked to define a real man, Mrs Cooper said: 'Oliver Reed was the most sexy man I've ever met. He was smouldering' Mrs Cooper â whose best-known novels include Riders and Rivals â also said that young women were too quick to shun marriage because they were more interested in casual sex than finding love. She said it was a shame that modern . couples rushed to have children out of wedlock. âNobody seems to mention . the word love any more. They just talk about having sex and women are . having babies and not bothering to have husbands any more,â she said. âI have been married nearly 52 years and Iâve always said a marriage is like building a cathedral, brick by brick by brick. âIâm very proud of being married for that long.â Asked to define a real man, she said: âOliver Reed was the most sexy man Iâve ever met. âHe just looked at you â it was pure smouldering. âWe love people like Rock Hudson â we had no idea they were gay. People like that â I love big, rugger-playing men.â Mrs Cooper has never shied away from taking a traditional view of relationships. In 1969 she wrote How To Stay Married, which controversially advised women to turn a blind eye to a husbandâs infidelity. In the 1990s she discovered that her husband Leo had enjoyed a six-year affair.

A New York Times investigation has found no evidence to support claims al-Qaeda or any other international terrorist organization had links to the 2012 storming of the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The six-part report published Saturday instead blamed the poorly-planned attack on local extremists outraged by an American-made video mocking Islam. The Times refutes claims made by many Republicans that al-Qaeda was involved in the attack despite Obama administration assertions to the contrary. Burned to the ground: The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi is seen in flames during a 2012 attack by an armed group said to have been protesting a film being produced in the United States . âExtensive interviews with Libyans in Benghazi who had direct knowledge of the attack there and its context, turned up no evidence that Al Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault,â the Times report found. The 2012 attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi was carried out by attackers who directly benefited from NATO funding and arms supplied during the Arab Spring uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, the Times reported. âThe attack was led, instead, by fighters who had benefited directly from NATOâs extensive air power and logistics support during the uprising against Colonel Qaddafi,â the report continued. âAnd contrary to claims by some members of Congress, it was fueled in large part by anger at an American-made video denigrating Islam,â it concluded. These claims come after over a year of accusations the Obama administration was working to cover up al-Qaeda involvement in the attack, which resulted in the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others. Locked and loaded, but not al-Qaeda: This armed man waving his firearm in the air was not supported by the terror group, he was a local militant, according to the New York Times . Supported by NATO: The Times also claims the militants used weapons provided by NATO during the Arab Spring uprising that ousted Muammar Gaddafi . Republicans took to talk shows and even held Congressional hearings on the matter, with House Rep Mike Rogers (R-MI) making al-Qaeda claims only last month. âIt was very clear to the individuals on the ground that this was an al-Qaeda-led event,â he said. The Times' conclusion that al-Qaeda did not aid in the attack is bolstered by a surprising phone call made from a Libyan militant to a friend close to the terror group. âThe only intelligence connecting al-Qaeda to the attack was an intercepted phone call that night from a participant in the first wave of the attack to a friend in another African country who had ties to members of al-Qaeda,â said the report.

When comedienne Joan Rivers first saw her Connecticut house, it was no laughing matter â she hated it. And now, having had the estate completely revamped at great cost, sheâs gone and sold it. The house, in rural New Preston, was reportedly bought for $4.4 million. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . It's a dog's life: Joan Rivers relaxes in her Connecticut home with her pets . Comfy: The house has a soft-round-the edges Victorian-esque look . According to the County Times, the new owners wish to remain anonymous. But whoever they are, theyâve bought a remarkable property. Ms Rivers, who's moved to California, had the place completely rebuilt after she bought it in 2000, having described it as looking like a popular fast-food outlet to Architectural Digest. The 80-year-old told the publication: âThis was the ugliest house Iâd ever seen. It looked like a Dennyâs, by a student of Frank Lloyd Wrightâs who didnât study hard enough.â House about that: Prior to the revamp Ms Rivers described the property as being the ugliest she'd ever seen . The luxury property had been on and off the market since 2009 . However, she was much happier with her home once retail executive Joe Cicio and architect Michael Boe had worked their magic. Following the revamp, Architectural Digest describe the property as being âa 5,000-square-foot house featuring 22-foot-high ceilings, 100-year-old chestnut beams, four wood-burning fireplaces, skylights and a massive country kitchenâ. It added: âThe living room, spacious enough to hold twin 10-foot-long custom-made sofas, is a festival of light, thanks to nine French doors, six of which open onto the free-form stone terrace that hugs the back of the house and abuts a lush expanse of lawn leading to the pool and poolhouse.â The luxury property had been on and off the market since 2009.

Astronauts have wrapped up urgent space station repairs during a rare Christmas Eve spacewalk, braving a 'mini blizzard' of noxious ammonia as they popped in a new pump. It was the second spacewalk in four days for U.S. astronauts Rick Mastracchio and Michael Hopkins, and only the second Christmas Eve spacewalk in NASA history. NASA ordered up the spacewalks to revive a critical cooling loop at the International Space Station. Scroll down for video . No turkey for Christmas: Astronauts Rick Mastracchio (top) and Michael Hopkins spend their Christmas Eve repairing an external cooling line on the International Space Station . One small step for man...: Astronauts Mike Hopkins (on the robotic arm, lower right) and Rick Mastracchio (front) take a rare spacewalk outside the International Space Station (ISS) All nonessential equipment had to be turned off when the line conked out on December 11, and many science experiments halted. With today's success, the cooling system should be restored and all equipment back up and running by this weekend, according to NASA. Mastracchio and Hopkins removed the faulty ammonia pump during Saturday's outing. On Christmas Eve, they installed the fresh pump. Standing on the end of the station's main robotic arm, Hopkins clutched the 780-pound, refrigerator-size pump with both hands as he headed toward its installation spot, and then slid it in. An astronaut working inside, Japan's Koichi Wakata, gingerly steered the arm and its precious load. 'Mike Hopkins taking a special sleigh ride on this Christmas Eve,' Mission Control commentator Rob Navias said as the space station soared over the Pacific. It was slow going because of a balky ammonia fluid line that sent frozen flakes of the extremely toxic substance straight at the men - 'a mini blizzard,' as Mission Control called it. The spacewalkers reported being surrounded by big chunks of the stuff that bounced off equipment and, in all probability, their suits. The ammonia needed to dissipate from their suits before the pair returned inside, to avoid further contamination. Flying high: 'It's like Christmas morning opening up a little present here,' astronaut Rick Mastracchio (top) said as he checked his toolkit . Zero gravity: Astronaut Mike Hopkins lies against the robotic arm during a spacewalk outside the International Space Station . 'Wow,' Hopkins sighed after the fourth and final fluid line was hooked to the new pump. The electrical hookups went more smoothly, and six hours into the spacewalk, Hopkins finally called down, 'Houston, you've got yourself a new pump module'. Christmas references filled the radio waves, as the action unfolded 260 miles above the planet. 'It's like Christmas morning opening up a little present here,' Mastracchio said as he checked his toolkit. Later, as he worked to remove the spare pump from its storage shelf, he commented: 'Now it really feels like I'm unwrapping a present.' Mission Control in Houston was in a festive mood, despite the gravity of the situation. Tabletop Christmas trees, Santa dolls and red Santa caps decorated the desks. NASA's only previous Christmas Eve spacewalk occurred in 1999 during a Hubble Space Telescope repair mission. But NASA's most memorable Christmas Eve was back on December 24, 1968. Apollo 8 astronauts read from Genesis, the first book of the Bible, as they orbited the moon on mankind's first lunar flight. Lost in space: The Christmas Eve venture was the second spacewalk in four days for U.S. astronauts Rick Mastracchio and Michael Hopkins . A bad valve in the ammonia pump caused the latest breakdown. Another team of spacewalking astronauts installed that pump just three years ago, and engineers are perplexed as to why it didn't last longer. NASA hopes to salvage it in the years ahead. The 2010 replacement required three spacewalks because of the difficulty in removing pressurized ammonia fluid lines. But this time, the astronauts managed to squeeze everything into two after NASA reduced the pressure and simplified the task. Mission Control planned to wait until Tuesday evening before fully activating the new pump, but initial testing showed everything working well. The two-line cooling system uses ammonia to dispel heat generated by on-board equipment; only one loop was disabled by the breakdown.

The second spacewalk was supposed to . take place on Monday, but it was delayed a day to give Mastracchio time . to switch to another suit. He . inadvertently hit a water switch in the air lock at the end of . Saturday's excursion, and a bit of water encroached on a cooling device . in the backpack of his suit, making it unusable. Otherwise, the suits remained dry during both spacewalks. Last . July, an astronaut almost drowned when water from his suit's cooling . system flooded his helmet. Makeshift snorkels and absorbent pads were . added to the suits as a precaution. A Moscow-led spacewalk, meanwhile, is set for Friday.

The traditional image of the birth of the universe suggests that all matter sparked into existence in a cataclysmic Big Bang more than 13 billion years ago. But this model is now being challenged by a theory which suggests the universe froze its way into existence in what has been deemed a 'Big Chill'. Theoretical physicists at the University of Melbourne said the best metaphor for the start of the universe should be considered as water freezing into ice. In this theory, the three spatial dimensions and the one dimension of time 'froze' into place - and the physicists suggest we could learn about the 'cracks in time and space' by investigating the natural cracks in ice particles. The Big Chill: Physicists from the University of Melbourne suggest we view the universe and the four known dimensions as 'freezing' their way into existence . The eternal spark: The traditional view of the universe creation is the Big Bang, when matter burst into existence . They say our understanding of the nature of the Universe could be . revolutionised by . investigating the cracks and crevices common to ice crystals. Lead . researcher on the project, James Quach said current theorising is the . latest in a long quest by humans to understand the origins and nature of . the Universe. He said: 'Ancient Greek philosophers wondered what matter was made of: was it made of a continuous substance or was it made of individual atoms? 'With very powerful microscopes, we now know that matter is made of atoms. 'Thousands of years later, Albert Einstein assumed that space and time were continuous and flowed smoothly, but we now believe that this assumption may not be valid at very small scales.' He added: 'A new theory, known as Quantum Graphity, suggests that space may be made up of indivisible building blocks, like tiny atoms. There are many theories as to how the universe formed. The Big Bang - which suggests that all the matter in the universe exploded from a single dense point - is the most popular model. There are differing schools of thought about how this type of universe will end. Will it continue expanding forever, eventually dying a cold death as the stars burn out? Alternatively the universe could stretch and 'bounce back' into a single point, leading to an endless cycle of universes contracting and expanding. Or the universe may be eternal - known as the 'steady state' theory which suggests there is no beginning or no end. Other popular theories suggest we could be part of a multiverse - one of many universes connected together, each with slightly different physical properties, or simply that the universe is a hologram or computer simulation. 'These indivisible blocks can be thought about as similar to pixels that make up an image on a screen. 'The challenge has been that these building blocks of space are very small, and so impossible to see directly.' However Quach and his colleagues believe they may have figured out a way to see them indirectly. He said: 'Think of the early universe as being like a liquid. 'Then as the universe cools, it ""crystallises"" into the three spatial and one time dimension that we see today. 'Theorised this way, as the Universe cools, we would expect that cracks should form, similar to the way cracks are formed when water freezes into ice.' RMIT University research team member Associate Professor Andrew Greentree said some of these defects might be visible. 'Light and other particles would bend or reflect off such defects, and therefore in theory we should be able to detect these effects,' he said. The team has calculated some of these effects and if their predictions are experimentally verified, the question as to whether space is smooth or constructed out of tiny indivisible parts will be solved once and for all.","University of Melbourne suggest theory could 'revolutionise' our understanding of the universe .

A majority of Republican supporters don't believe in evolution and instead are convinced that humans have existed in their present form since the dawn of time. The analysis published this week by the Pew Research Center found that by comparison, a majority of Democrats do believe that man is descended from apes. The poll found that 67 percent of Democrats believe believe 'humans and other things have evolved over timeâ, compared to 43 percent of Republicans. Creationism versus Evolution: Research has found a widening gap between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to how man came to be . The number of Republicans who believe in human evolution has declined nine percent since 2009 . One of the most interesting trends to emerge from the analysis is that the number of Republicans who donât believe in evolution has shifted in the past four years. In 2009, the amount of Republicans who though humans evolved over time was 54 percent but when the same question was asked earlier this year that number had dropped nine points to 43 percent. During the same time period, the number of Democrats who think humans evolved increased three points to 67 percent. âRepublicans are less inclined than either Democrats or political independents to say that humans have evolved over time,â the study reads. Several senior Republican figures including Mike Huckabee, left, and Paul Broun, right, have questioned or attacked evolution in recent years . In 2012 Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia blasted evolution, embryology and the big bang as 'lies straight from the pit of hell' The enduring popularity of the creationism theory within the U.S. puts it at odds with most other developed nations. An overwhelming majority of the scientific community accepts evolution as the dominant scientific theory of biological diversity. Nearly every scientific society, representing hundreds of thousands of scientists, has issued statements rejecting intelligent design and a petition supporting the teaching of evolutionary biology was endorsed by 72 US Nobel Prize winners. Additionally, U.S. courts have ruled in favor of teaching evolution in science classrooms, and against teaching creationism however in recent years several senior Republican figures have questioned or attacked evolution in the public sphere. In 2012 Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia blasted evolution, embryology and the big bang as âlies straight from the pit of hell.â âI hold the Holy Bible as being the major . directions to me of how I vote in Washington, D.C. and I'll continue to . do that,â the young earth creationist said to resounding applause. One third of Americans still believe in Creationism versus Evolution . During the 2008 U.S. Republican presidential primaries former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee spoke publicly about his skepticism of evolution. âA person either believes that God created this process or that it was an accident,â Huckabee said during a debate, âand that it just happened all on its own.â Huckabee also dismissed the thought that his rejection of evolution plays any his role in whether he is qualified for public office. The PEW study was conducted between March 21 and April 8, 2013, with a representative sample of 1,983 adults, aged 18 and older. The survey was conducted on landlines and cellphones in all 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. The margin of error was three percentage points. Overall the poll found that 60 percent of Americans believed in evolution, compared to 33 percent who believed human had evolved over time. When those people polled were divided by their religious affiliation the results showed that majority of white evangelicals believe that a supreme being guided evolution . Of the group of people who believe in evolution, 32 percent believe it was due to natural selection, while . roughly 24 percent believe that 'a supreme being guided the evolution . of living things for the purpose of creating humans and other life in . the form it exists today.' While 78 percent of white mainline protestants said they believed humans and other animals had evolved over time, the number was just 27 percent for white evangelicals. According to PEW, the belief in creationism versus evolution is closely linked to religious background and race. The study also investigated the differences between demographic groups and alsoÂ  the differences in language. They worded the evolution question in two different ways. One way they phrased it as 'humans and other living things' and the other way they phrased it was as 'animals and other living things.' They found that exchanging animals for humans made very little difference in people's beliefs about evolution. However, the study found that men were more likely than women to believe that humans/ animals and other living things evolved. They also found those who had completed a form of higher education believed in evolution more than people who hadn't.","Latest analysis from Pew Research Center has found that the majority of Republicans don't believe in evolution .

When the president has some downtime, he likes to unwind like the rest of us - binge watching television shows. Recent reports quote the President as saying he'd rather hang out with the 'Duck Dynasty' family than the Kardashian clan, but reality TV aside, Obama's a fan of high-quality TV drama, with the occasional comedy for good measure. It seems Obama seeks escapism through some of the critically-acclaimed series produced by the cable networks. Couch-time: In what little spare time he has, the president like to catch up on top-quality drama - and sports . Art-imitating-life shows like 'House of Cards' and 'Homeland' are obvious choices, but the president is also drawn to darker fare, such as AMC's 'Breaking Bad.' According to a recent New York Times report, the president is working his way through the box-set of 'Breaking Bad.' Although the series ended recently, he's understandably behind and reminds those around him not to spoil the ending. TV aficionado: Obama likes some of television's more hard-hitting series, such as Breaking Bad, The Wire and Homeland . Big fan: Do not ruin the ending of Breaking Bad for President Obama - he's understandably slightly behind and has not yet seen the finale . The Times also reports that the President is eagerly awaiting the second season of 'House of Cards,' the political drama centered on Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), a Democrat who, after getting passed over for appointment as secretary of state, decides to exact revenge. 'I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient,' Obama was overheard saying to Reed Hastings, the Netflix CEO, who invited the president to do a cameo on the show, the New York Times reports. Obama joked of the sleazy, congressman-murderer Mr Underwood, 'This guyâs getting a lot of stuff done.' Dragon tamer: Obama has professed his love for the dragon-heavy, nudity-happy fantasy drama Game of Thrones . Proving he has his finger on the pop- culture pulse, President Obama has also claimed to be a fan of 'Game of Thrones,' 'Boardwalk Empire,' and even the BBC's massive hit 'Downton Abbey.' Cementing his status as a bona fide TV aficionado, Obama has repeatedly remarked that HBO's 'The Wire' is one of the greatest television shows of all time. The now-defunct cult hit focused on the hard streets of Baltimore's projects and a drug war carried out between the city's cops and its hardout drug dealers. David Simon, the show's creator, pondered whether Obama liked the show because it so clearly dealt with issues of socio-economic strife. '""The Wire"" was one of the few shows that was about the other America,' Simon told the New York Times. 'It was set in the inner city. The characters were of a class that has been left behind economically and politically.' Family viewing: The President and his family are also fans of lighthearted comedies Parks and Recreation and Modern Family . In a speech this month, the President vowed to spend the remainder of his presidency fighting against the kind of poverty depicted in 'The Wire.' 'The idea that a child may never be able to escape that poverty because she lacks a decent education or health care, or a community that views her future as their own,' Obama said, 'that should offend all of us and it should compel us to action. We are a better country than this.' On the lighter side, though, President Obama has also mentioned that he and his family like to watch comedies such as Parks and Recreation and Modern Family together.","President Obama loves 'Breaking Bad,' but he hasn't finished watching the series yet .

A 20-year-old upstate New York volunteer emergency medical technician was suspended after he broke the rules to drive a four-year-old child to hospital.The board the made the decision to suspend volunteer EMT and squad leader Stephen Sawyer after he drove the Ellenville ambulance to pick up a four-year-old boy who was suffering from a seizure and take him to hospital. Resigned: Stephen Sawyer, 20, resigned after the Ellenville First Aid and Rescue Squad suspended him for driving the squad's ambulance . The Ellenville First Aid and Rescue Squad's rules dictate that ambulance drivers must be at least 21 years of age. In a 4-3 decision, the board decided to . suspend Sawyer, who is also a volunteer firefighter and part-time police . officer, for 60 days. Upset by the decision, Sawyer immediately tendered his resignation. The . board's decision has caused an outcry in the community, where people . feel the young EMT should not be penalized for helping a child. According . to the Times Herald-Record, Sawyer was at the Ellenville First Aid and . Rescue Squad's headquarters when the call came in about a four-year-old . having seizures. A paramedic soon arrived at the child's home in an SUV and called for an ambulance. Sawyer, alone at headquarters, called the Kerhonkson Accord First Aid Squad, but they were busy on another call. He then called three more ambulance . services over the next 15 minutes but came up empty-handed, so he . climbed into the ambulance himself, drove the five miles to the child's . house and took the child, his mother and the paramedic to Ellenville . Regional Hospital. 'I wouldn't have been able to sleep at night or go to school knowing there's a four-year-old suffering,' Sawyer told the Times Herald-Record. The following Monday, he was called before the board of directors and asked to explain himself. Sawyer says he believes he made the best decision and that although he is only 20, he has experience driving ambulances for the Mobile Life Support Services. The board decided to suspend him for 60 days and revoke his title of advisor from the Youth Squad, which he had restarted when he joined the volunteers as a 15-year-old. Sawyer quit his position and soon . after a post about the whole episode was posted on the Ulster County . Fire/Rescue Facebook page. It soon went viral, with more than 400 comments, most in support of Sawyer, and 1,300 'likes.' Captain and board member for Ellenville First Aid services tells a slightly different story from Sawyer's. Gaveris . said Sawyer's suspension came about not as the result of an isolated . incident, but from a 'culmination of different incidents,' as well as . other aspects of the December 11 call. Community-minded: Stephen Sawyer is a part-time police officer, volunteer firefighter and until recently volunteer EMT . The Daily Freeman reports that Sawyer was at the squad's station at around 10:45am on December 11 with another EMT and an ambulance driver when the call came in about the four-year-old having seizures. Two minutes later, another call came in about an 80-year-old man who had fallen and was bleeding from his arm. Sawyer, despite not being authorized to decide which call should take priority, told the other EMT and the driver to go to the aid of the elderly man, according to Gavaris. 'They should have never listened to him. Protocol is to go to the first call unless the other one is of a more critical nature,' the captain told the Daily Freeman. 'They listened to [Sawyer] and trusted his judgment because he worked for a paid service.' Gavaris said Sawyer believed another driver was on his way, but was mistaken. After being unable to find another driver, he went himself. Underage: Sawyer drove one of these ambulances but isn't permitted to do so until he's 21 . 'He delayed transport on a patient,' he said. Gavaris said that despite his error of judgement, that incident alone wouldn't have gotten Sawyer suspended. However, Sawyer had a record of 'violating our policies and not following our rules. ... Had this been the first incident, he would have been told not to do it again.' Gavaris said squad rules about under-21s driving ambulances are standard and that Sawyer does not have the proper training to operate one. The Ellenville First Aid and Rescue Squad addressed the furor over Sawyer's suspension on its Facebook page. 'Your posts are welcome on this site, but any derogatory posts will be deleted,' reads a post on the page. 'The 20 year [old] should be praised! He took a risk to help a 4 year old child. This would not have been an issue had the squad had better prepared for a call... This only shows lack of preparation for this individual unit. Simply sad. Very glad this isn't the department I would depend on if my child or family was in a medical emergency,' reads a response. Many other comments follow along these lines, including many from Stephen Sawyer's mother, Leslie A. Gonzalez, who alleges Gavaris has disliked her son since he began volunteering with the squad.","A 20-year-old EMT was suspended for driving an ambulance to take a four-year-old having a seizure to hospital .

A group of daring archaeologists uncovered a lost 1,200-year-old city on a misty Cambodian mountain by hacking through the thick jungle, strewn with live land mines. Yet they were also aided in their quest by some incredible technology that revealed the ancient city to them in the first place, and guided by a local - a one-legged former Khmer Rouge soldier. Mahendraparvata, the city they found, is thought to pre-date the famous site of Angkor Wat by around 350 years and lies only 25 miles west of that huge temple. Archaeologists believe Mahendraparvata was the first city of the Angkor Empire in 802 AD. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Discovery: Damian Evans, director of the University of Sydney's archaeological research center in Cambodia, was amazed by what his team found . Technology: The airborne Lidar system revealed a long-forgotten urban landscape . Finds: The team discovered 1,200-year-old statues and temples . Lidar is a remote sensing technology that measures distance by shooting a laser at a target and analysing the light that is reflected back. The technology was developed in the early 1960s and uses laser imaging with radar technology that can calculate distances. It was first used in meteorology to measure clouds by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The term lidar is a portmanteau of 'light and 'radar.' Lidar uses ultraviolet, visible, or near infrared light to image objects and can be used with a wide range of targets, including non-metallic objects, rocks, rain, chemical compounds, aerosols, clouds and even single molecules. A narrow laser beam can be used to map physical features with very high resolution. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the expedition exclusively, which began in earnest after the team used Lidar technology on a helicopter. The Lidar system uses pulsing laser signals to see through the thick undergrowth, where it detected a distinct outline of the the long-forgotten city.

So his team headed into the perilous . mountain countryside of Cambodia, along goat tracks, through deep bogs . and around rivers, always avoiding the live land mines placed during . previous conflicts. Location: Mahendraparvata lies in the Phnom Kulen mountain range in Siem Reap Province of Cambodia . They were helped in this by Heng Heap, a chain-smoking former Khmer Rouge soldier who lost a leg in mine explosion. Even the local was surprised by what the archaeologists took him to. The team discovered a whole urban landscape with canals, roads, caves and, as yet unexplained, mounds which could be tombs. Evans added that: 'There may be implications for society today... for example, we see from the imagery that the landscape was completely devoid of vegetation.' The  archaeologist had one explanation for this: 'One theory we are looking at is that the severe environmental impact of deforestation and the dependence on water management led to the demise of the civilisation â¦ perhaps it became too successful to the point of becoming unmanageable.' Ancestor: The new-found city predates the famous Angkor Wat temple by 350 years . The archaeologists were astounded by what they found . Lidar imagery shows the central area of Angkor. The 'walled city' of Angkor Thom is pictured above Angkor Wat. The red lines are features such as roads and canals from the post-medieval period, while the other features are from the Angkor era . A pre-publication draft from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences claimed that Mahendraparvata, as well as Angkor Wat, would have been part of a 'vast urban network.' The paper said: 'We identify an entire, previously undocumented, formally planned urban landscape into which the major temples such as Angkor Wat were integrated.' Beyond these newly identified urban landscapes, the Lidar data reveal anthropogenic changes to the landscape on a vast scale, and lend further weight to an emerging consensus that infrastructural complexity, unsustainable modes of subsistence and climate variation were crucial factors in the decline of the classical Khmer civilization.' According to NBC News, the researchers claim the new map shows a pattern ofÂ  'city blocks'. Mounds and ponds would have been built within these blocks to create temple precincts. They type of 'cityscapes' were seen in ancient Angkor as well as the Phnom Kulen region and another area farther northeast, known as Koh Ker. The researchers added: 'These 'urban temples' are not isolated; rather, they are nodes in an increasingly concentrated medieval cityscape.'","Archaeologists used Lidar technology that combines narrow lasers with radars to scan the ancient city .

More than 100 secret documents detailing the private discussions between Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and George W Bush before the Iraq war are set to be declassified and published. The Mail has learned senior civil servants are âcloseâ to a deal to let the Chilcot Inquiry into the war publish the documents after more than a year of wrangling. Records of telephone conversations between Mr Blair and Mr Bush, notes between the two men and even papers documenting Cabinet discussions on the war are expected to be released to the public. Private notes: George W Bush and Tony Blair in February 2001 . Senior Whitehall sources say that the . papers are likely to be published within three months - clearing the way . for the publication of the report, nearly five years after Sir John . Chilcot began his inquiries. Sir John has repeatedly complained that he has been prevented from publishing his conclusions because Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was blocking publication of the key papers on which his judgments were based. Last month Sir John wrote to David Cameron to say the Cabinet Office had ânot reached a final positionâ on whether to release the requested documents. But a senior Government source has now revealed that Sir Jeremy intends to release as many papers as possible, in contrast to his predecessor Sir Gus OâDonnell, who counselled against publishing any of the Cabinet discussions or private notes between prime ministers and Mr Bush. The source said yesterday that âgood progressâ had been made towards declassifying many of the records and added: âThere will be a lot more than people were expecting.â Some of the contents of the documents will be blacked out for national security reasons and to prevent US and British relations being damaged. Release: Telephone records, notes and even documents from Cabinet discussions are to be made public . However, the source said: âThere is an . ongoing process of declassification, which is attempting to strike a . balance to ensure you are not setting a legal precedent that could . oblige you to publish other documents in the future or damage national . security. âThere are likely to be some redactions - but only where absolutely necessary. The intention is to be transparent.â The documents at issue include up to 200 Cabinet-level discussions on the Iraq war, notes sent between Mr Blair and Mr Bush, and more than 130 records of conversations between either Mr Blair or Mr Brown and the White House. Tony Blairâs spokesman said: âThe inquiry of course had full access to all documents, including all the confidential correspondence between president Bush and then prime minister, Mr Blair. âIn addition, Mr Blair agreed at the last inquiry hearing to answer questions in a way that specifically revealed the contents of the correspondence on the issues that interested the inquiry.â But Mr Blair told Sir John: âI think it is extremely important that the British prime minister and the American president are able to communicate in confidence, and if something is given in confidence it should be treated like that, but I am very happy to tell you the basis of what I said.â A Cabinet Office spokesman said: âThe Government is currently engaged in discussions with the inquiry, which the inquiry recognises raises difficult issues, including legal and international relations issues. âThese issues are being worked through in good faith and with a view to reaching a position as rapidly as possible. âThe inquiry should be allowed to publish its findings and we should not pre-empt the content of the report.â","The Mail has learned civil servants are âcloseâ to a deal to allow publication .

China has banned officials from smoking in public places such as schools and hospitals in renewed efforts to cut the 1.4million deaths linked to tobacco each year. The edict, which comes from the highest levels of the ruling Communist Party, has been hailed as a 'major breakthrough' in a country which has the world's largest number of smokers with 300million. Until Sunday's notice from the State Council, or China's Cabinet, and the party's central committee, attempts to curb smoking in public places were largely limited to city and other local-level measures. Stubbing it out: Chinese delegates attending a meeting at the Great Hall of the People smoke cigarettes in Beijing. China is to ban officials from smoking in public to set an example to the rest of the country (file picture) The health ministry pushed out guidelines banning smoking in venues including hotels and restaurants in 2011, but these were criticized as having no clear punishments or details on how such bans would be enforced. The new rules, which campaigners hope will help bring about a nationwide law banning smoking in public places, call on officials to lead by example by stubbing out their cigarettes. Officials are not allowed to smoke in schools, hospitals, sports venues, on public transport or any other places where smoking is banned, or to smoke or offer cigarettes when performing official duties, the official Xinhua News said. They also cannot use public funds to buy cigarettes, and within Communist Party or government offices tobacco products cannot be sold nor adverts displayed. 'This is likely a major breakthrough. For the first time, very high-level attention and support is being given to anti-tobacco efforts,' said Ray Yip, head of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's China program, which has been working on smoking cessation campaigns in the country. 'This likely will lead to meaningful legislation and enforcement related to smoking,' Yip said. Health hazard: Officials are no longer allowed to smoke in schools, hospitals, sports venues or on public transport . China, with a population of 1.35 billion, has more than 300 million smokers. Experts say huge revenues from the state-owned tobacco monopoly have hindered anti-smoking measures. An order banning party officials from smoking indoors, handed down from the highest levels of power, could help to reduce its influence. Smoking, which is linked to an average annual death toll of 1.4 million people in China in recent years, is one of the greatest health threats the country faces, government statistics show. The annual number of cigarettes sold in the country increased by 50 per cent to 2.52 trillion in 2012 compared with 10 years earlier, according to the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control, which is overseen by health authorities. 'Smoking remains a relatively universal phenomenon in public venues. Some officials smoke in public places, which has not only jeopardized the environment and public health, but tarnished the image of party and government offices and leaders and has a negative influence,' the circular read, according to Xinhua.","Country has the world's highest number of smokers with 300million .

An Oklahoma man entangled in a shocking love triangle was killed Friday, allegedly at the hands of his adversary: his own former son-in-law. Police say Rodney Aaron Wilson, 38, of Stilwell shot and killed Rickey Lee Harlin, 53, on the evening of December 27 before calling 911 to report he'd fired in self-defense. Meanwhile, the victim's daughter and ex-wife of the accused killer Stacie Catron, 36, has unwittingly become a fourth player in this deadly game and says the two men were feuding over the affections of the same woman. What's more, investigations have revealed that Wilson has had deadly encounters with family before. Scroll down for video... Feud gone too far? Rodney Aaron Wilson, 38, is awaiting charges he shot dead his ex father-in-law as part of what his ex-wife says was a squabble over a woman they were both pursuing . Gone: Rickey Lee Harlin is dead and police believe it was at the hands of his former son-in-law. Wilson called 911 to Harlin's Oklahoma home on Friday claiming he'd shot Harlin in self-defense. Authorities arrive to find Harlin dead . In November of 2000, Wilson was arrested and charged with the murder of his own stepmother. Police arrived at the scene of Wilson's most recent entanglement to find Harlin already dead on the ground. 'When I arrived both vehicles were sitting in the drive,' Adair County Sheriff David Hardin told 5newsonline.com. 'I donât know whose vehicle it is, but there was a Tahoe and Mr. Wilsonâs truck sitting behind it, and I did notice Mr. Harlin, the deceased, lying on the ground in front of Mr. Wilsonâs truck,' he continued. Wilson was arrested on suspicion of first degree murder on Friday and the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation was called in to take over the case. 'While the investigation into the murder continues, it appears Wilson went to Harlin's home where a confrontation ensued,' the OSBI wrote in a December 29 release. As of Monday, no official charges had been filed against Wilson, suggesting that investigators still aren't sure what went on during the confrontation. However, Catron, who has a 15-year-old son with Wilson, says she knows what led to it. '[They] were involved with the same woman,' she told NewsOK. According to that same source, Wilson has had bad blood with relatives before. Unwitting participant: Stacie Catron says her ex-husband and father were after the same unnamed woman and that's what led to their deadly encounter . In 2000, he was hauled to jail and booked for the murder of Theresa Wilson--his stepmother. Theresa Wilson was found dead from a gunshot wound in the front seat of a pickup truck after a dispute with Rodney. Catron said the charges were later dropped and expunged from Wilson's record. While Wilson's history make render recent allegations unsurprising, he son seems to think the men were on relatively decent terms. Also named Rodney, Wilson's son told 5newsonline they share no violent history. He also said how much he'll miss the grandfather he says raised him. 'He showed me everything I know, how to work, how to do anything, ride a horse, build something, and I learned how to respect people,' he said. Wilson is being held without bail until January 9, by which time prosecutors anticipate they'll have gathered sufficient evidence for a first degree murder charge.","Rodney Aaron Wilson of Stilwell, Oklahoma is charged in the December 27 shooting death of his ex-wife's father Rickey Lee Harlin .

Edelin's wife, Barbara, confirmed that he died after suffering from cancer. She said that her husband was a great teacher and mentor, guiding many young doctors over his career. Passed away: Kenneth Edelin died Monday morning aged 74 after battling cancer. The Boston physician was at the center of a landmark abortion case in the 1970s . âHe was a great advocate for the rights of women to have choice in their own reproductive freedom,â Barbara Edelin said. âParticularly for women of color and other minorities.â She said he was affected deeply as a child when his mother died of breast cancer. âHe became a doctor because that's what he thought he needed to do to help women,â Barbara Edelin said. Edelin made national headlines when he was convicted of manslaughter in 1975 for performing an abortion. That was two years after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized the procedure with its decision on Roe v. Wade. According to NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the Massachusetts Supreme Court later overturned Edelin's guilty verdict, in a case that helped legally define what an abortion is and when human life begins. Landmark court case: Edelin was convicted on a manslaughter charge in a jury trial, but the verdict was later overturned by a Massachusetts court . Edelin went on to become an outspoken . activist and spokesman for reproductive rights, the LDF said. He also . served as a chairman of the board of Planned Parenthood.

In the book Broken Justice: A True Story of Race, Sex and Revenge in a Boston Courtroom, Edelin recounted the experiences of his criminal case. âAt the center of this book are the rights of women to control their own bodies, and the rights of doctors to perform legitimate and legal medical procedures,â Edelin wrote. âFor me, the struggles for reproductive rights for women and Civil Rights for African-Americans are intertwined and at the same time parallel. âThe denial of these two rights is an attempt by some to control the bodies of others.

The Aldi wine is said to be âperfect for any occasion, with hints of apple and lemon citrusâ and âfantastically crisp and elegant with green apples, perfect acidity and persistent bubblesâ. The French offering was acknowledged in a survey by wine app Wotwine and has also been described by national newspapers as âcurrently the best value sparkler in Britainâ and âvery drinkable and a total bargainâ. The Louis Roederer bottle was described as âconsistently rated as one of the finest non-vintage champagnesâ and comes from a family-owned Champagne house established in the 19th century. The Blanc de Noirs translates as 'whites of blacks' and is made with a blend of two black varieties: Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier.

Increased media exposure has led to a collapse in the personal ratings of UKIP leader Nigel Farage, new analysis reveals. Despite the UK Independence Party winning scores of council seats and boasting of victory in next yearâs European elections, the public appears to have fallen out of love with the partyâs smoking, drinking figurehead. From a peak net satisfaction rating of +11 per cent in May, he slumped to -13 per cent in November, with almost half saying he is âmore style than substanceâ. Dissatisfaction: Net public approval ratings for Mr Farage have collapsed during 2013 . Personality: Nigel Farage has proven popular with voters, but their fear he would not be good in a crisis . UKIP has enjoyed an extraordinary year, cementing a lead in the polls over the Liberal Democrats and forcing the Tories to set out a tougher stance on Europe. While the Conservatives fear they could lose MPs if voters switching to UKIP allow Labour to win, Mr Farage insists he is taking support from all the main parties. UKIP is expected to capitalise on the lifting of work restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians from January by arguing that only by leaving the EU can Britain take back control of its borders. Mr Farage has boasted that he will trigger a âpolitical earthquakeâ by topping the polls in Mayâs elections to the European Parliament. But analysis of Ipsos MORI opinion polls throughout 2013 shows how public satisfaction with the UKIP leader has tumbled as voters get to see him more. In May 40 per cent of those questioned said they were âsatisfiedâ with Mr Farage as leader, while only 26 per cent were dissatisfied. Views: Voters were asked what they thought of Mr Farage, and almost half thought he was 'more style than substance' By November the figures had reversed, with only 28 per cent satisfied to 41 per cent satisfied. In December the figures improved slightly, with satisfied at 33 per cent and dissatisfied 38 per cent. Pollsters warn UKIPâs appeal as the ânone of the aboveâ party for those disaffected with the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems will be eroded as their profile rises. Voters who learn more about Mr Farage have grown more dissastifed. Tom Mludzinski, deputy head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: âAs with most political leaders, itâs a case of the more they get to know someone the less they like them. 'Mr Farageâs personal approval ratings have become increasingly negative over the course of the year as more people see him and get to know him. Perhaps he is appearing more like any other politician. âThe one thing UKIP are seen as is different from everyone but thatâs going to be difficult to keep up if they do start winning and doing well.â Mr Farage remains a âbig factorâ for the partyâs appeal, with 9 out of 10 UKIP supporters saying they are satisfied with him. Popular: During 2013 UKIP has cemented its lead in the polls over the Liberal Democrats, ending the year on 10 per cent . Mr Mludzinski said: âUKIP supporters are generally dissatisfied with everyone, whatever questions we ask, they tend to be more negative about everything. âIt might be this is mid-term blues and people who are fed-up with the status quo donât have anyone to turn to but UKIP. âThe public know very little about UKIP and their policies at the moment and so can use them as a blank canvas. People donât know anything about them. They donât know what policies they have or what they stand for really. At the moment they can use them as a blank canvas.â Half of voters say Mr Farage has âlots of personalityâ but they also say he is âmore style than substanceâ. Just over a third (36 per cent) say he is out of touch with ordinary people and only 19 per cent think he has âsound judgementâ and 16 per cent think he would be âgood in a crisisâ.","Net satisfaction falls from peak of 11% in May to -13% in November .

Although there were no other signs of a supernatural journey on the nonplussed moggy, nor even a whiff of reindeer, Ms Gallagher discounted the possibility the G-Paws tracker had malfunctioned, and spread the word of her Yuletide mystery. Posting on Facebook the next day, she said: 'I live alone, was asleep in bed and my cat had the unit on at the time this was recorded.The top speed was 183mph! 'She went from my street to a location miles away in the middle of a river, then back again for a while then again to another location miles away in one minute, travelled over rooftops and then home again! Log: The readings from the G-Paws device show the route Suki is supposed to have taken - in a straight line over the rooftops of Plymouth . 'The unit has been used on her daily for weeks with no previous issues. You can see the difference in how it was moving by comparing her normal meandering route and the route travelled that night - too fast for a car and not via the streets but over the houses! 'I've not believed in Santa since I was a child but think maybe she hitched a ride in his sleigh?' However, the makers of G-Paws were not in the mood for a miracle, and pointed out that their devices are prone to giving inaccurate readings when their batteries run low. Riding with Mr Claus? Ms Gallagher deduced that only hitching a ride with Father Christmas could have moved Suki so far so fast . Managing director Dave Evans told local paper the Plymouth Herald: 'Iâm afraid the reality is rather less exciting. Occasionally when the unit runs a little low on power it will only take a partial reading and second guess where it is. 'It sometimes gets it wrong which results in spikes in the tracklog. The best way to avoid them is to keep the unit fully charged as it tends to happen when itâs low on power.'","Melony Gallagher noticed her cat, Suki, made an unusual Christmas journey .

A man jailed for murder is to be released after 34 years - because the sister of the sole witness said her testimony was a lie. Brenda Anderson testified in 1979 that Kash Delano Register, 53, had shot dead her elderly neighbor Jack Sasson at his West Los Angeles home. But more than three decades later Anderson's sister Sharon took the stand and said the account was a lie. Vindicated: Kash Delano Register, surrounded by lawyers at the Superior Court in Los Angeles, sobs as he is released 34 years after he was jailed for murder - because the sole witness' sister said her testimony was a lie . Yesterday a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge threw out the murder conviction. Brenda Anderson, then 19, had told police she saw Register gun down Sasson in his carport from her window - Sasson's girlfriend she said was with him at the time of the shooting, reported the LA Times. His release came after another of Anderson's sisters Sheila Vanderkam, typed Register's name into a convict website search in 2011 and was horrified to discover he was still in jail due in part to her sister's testimony. She tracked down Register's attorney and told him her sister's eyewitness testimony was untrue something she and Sharon Anderson had tried to tell police in 1979. According to Vanderkam, at the time of the shooting, her sisters had just hidden a package of Avon products they had stolen from a neighbor. Sharon Anderson said they heard shots, but they could not get a clear look at the shooter because they were too far away. Court papers said at trial none of the seven fingerprints found on Sasson's car matched Register's. Police never recovered the murder weapon - they did seize a pair of pinstriped pants from Register's closet, which had a speck of blood smaller than a pencil eraser. Overcome: Register's mother, Wilma Register, pictured centre, wept uncontrollably as her son was released . But the blood type, O, matched bath Sasson and Register. Vanderkam worked at the same LAPD station as the detectives investigating the shooting and claimed she tried to tell one of them that Brenda Anderson had lied. 'The detective placed his finger over his mouth (like a shush sound) and just stared at me,' she said in her declaration. 'He made it very clear to me, without actually saying anything, that I was to stay out of it.' Her sister Sharon also told police that they had they wrong man - even when police threatened to lock her up for the stolen Avon package, she did not relent, . But police and prosecutors never disclosed what Sharon Anderson said to the defense, Register's attorneys said. She did not testify during his trial. Register who had refused to admit guilt during his parole hearings, put his head on the table as the ruling was made yesterday while his mother wept.","Kash Delano Register, 53, was accused of killing Jack Sasson in LA .

With computer games, television shows and mobile phones to distract them, it is no wonder that some children end up lying in the house all day. But one who is bucking that trend is 10-year-old Will Doran, who has lived up to the Scout oath to always do his best by earning every single cub badge. The adventurous young man, part of 3rd Sandhurst Troop in Berkshire, has earned all 33 activity badges, six challenge awards, six staged activity badges, three partnership awards, three core badges and the Chief Scout's Bronze and Silver awards. Proud: Will Doran, 10, has collected all 51 Cub Scout badges as well as winning two awards for his work . In order to get them, Will had to practice martial arts, learn astronomy, master ice skating, hone his DIY skills, learn a foreign language and ride a horse - to name just a few activities. However, when it came to sewing all 51 badges onto his uniform, he did need to turn to Mum for some help. Will said 'I felt really excited to have achieved it and very proud of myself. It took determination and persistence. The hardest badges were horse riding and sailing.' Enduring whatever the elements hurled at him, he toiled on scrub clearance at the local Wildmoor Heath nature reserve for his final Cub badge, Global Conservation, which was handed to him at a special presentation ceremony by assistant district commissioner Pam Pearce at the Scout hut in Sandhurst Memorial Park. In order to get his badges Will had to learn a foreign language and practise martial arts, but according to him the sailing and horse riding were the hardest . From the age of six to eight, he achieved all 12 Beaver badges and by the time he was nine and a half, both the Chief Scoutâs Bronze and Silver awards were sewn on to his jumper. Heâs won all 53 Cub Scout awards in just under two and a half years, which is the time youngsters can be Cub Scouts, from the age of eight to 10 and a half. Brenda Davies, the group Scout leader - known as Akela - said 'I have been with the Scouts since 1998 and this is the first time I have ever seen this. 'When he got his Silver award in January last year, he said I am going to get all other badges and I didnât really believe him. 'He stuck to his word and pestered us. He is a very lovely, enthusiastic adventurous little Cub who is a real credit to his parents and we are really proud of him.' Now that he is nearly 11 Will has to move on to the Scouts and hopes to complete all the Duke of Edinburgh awards as a teenager . Willâs father Colin is group chairman of 3rd Sandhurst Scouts, his sister Olivia, 15, is a Ranger and 12-year-old brother Louis is a Scout. All three siblings were representing Scouting and Guiding when the Duke of Edinburgh visited Sandhurst in April and Prince Philip admired Willâs collection of badges. Now heâs nearly eleven, Will has joined the Scouts and he said 'When I am a teenager I am hopefully going to do all of the Duke of Edinburgh awards.' Dad Colin, 51, said 'We are really proud of him. It shows the tenacity he has at everything he does.' Andrew Thorp, Scout Association spokesman, said 'For a young person to have achieved all of their badges shows a diverse and adventurous programme is being provided locally. 'Scouting is more popular than it has been for a very long time with numbers growing across the UK.'","Will Doran has earned all 51 Cub Scout badges and two awards .

Most Chancellors are accused of disappearing from public gaze, particularly when the economy takes a turn for the worst. George Osborne has admitted retreating to the Treasury last year in the wake of his disastrous âpasty taxâ Budget which unravelled within hours. But as the economy has picked up this year he has been determined to be seen helping every sector of the economy â especially manufacturers of hi-vis jackets. United colours of Osborne: 2013 was the year when George Osborne went out of his way to be seen . A year ago Mr Osborne decided that he would use 2013 to âget out thereâ and explain what he was doing to boost the economy. But having had a relatively low media profile, he needed to do something to ensure he was visible to the public. So . from factories to bakeries, oil platforms in the North Sea to coal . mines in Nottinghamshire, the Chancellor has been donned the bright . yellow and orange outfits beloved of the health and safety police to . meet the âimportant peopleâ who make Britain tick. His . rising political stock has coincided with the recovery gaining . momentum, with the economy now expected to grow by the Office for Budget Responsibility by 1.4 per . cent this year, up from 0.6 per cent forecast in May. January: George Osborne was feeling blue as 2013 got underway and he toured factory of train wheel manufacturers Lucchini UK in  Manchester . February: Mr Osborne donned a a high-vis vest to admire machinery at Prysmian Group while campaigning for Tory candidate Maria Hutchings in the Eastleigh by-election . February: Mr Osborne did not always look like he was enjoying himself in Eastleigh as he campaigned for the Conservatives . Mr Osborne has admitted that the hi-vis visits have been part of a deliberate drive to raise his profile. He . said: âLast year when the economic situation was difficult, when the . budget had not been well-received, I got into that situation which I . think happens to politicians which is âI am going to get on with the . job, if people donât want to hear an explanation of what I am doing , so . be it, I am just going to stick at itâ. âTowards . the end of last year I realised that you cannot do that if you are . doing my job. You have got to get out there and explain what you are . doing and why you are doing it, why you think it is the right thing for . the country,â he told Channel 4 News during the Tory party conference.' March: The day after delivering his Budget statement in the Commons, the Chancellor joined Chairman of Berkeley Group Tony Pidgley (left) and Mike Woolliscroft(right), project director for Berkeley Group, on a visit to a housing development in  Woolwich . March: Mr Osborne did his best to look relaxed while chatting with workmen . May: As the economy showed signs of recovery, Mr Osborne's love of hi-vis went international as he invited  India's Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, (right), to tour the Pudding Mill Lane Crossrail construction site, in east London . May: Pressure was still on Mr Osborne in the spring, with the International Monetary Fund insisting Britain could do more to deliver growth . May: A visit to the Port Of Liverpool during a visit to mark the start of dredging of the River Mersey Estuary saw orange and yellow hi-vis worn together . Mr Osborne went on: âI . have got out of the Treasury a bit more over the last few months and . tried to consciously go around the country, meet working people, go to . lots of work places and the like. âBecause I think it is an obligation on someone doing my job, with the responsibilities I have, to explaining what I am doing. âIt . is probably true to say that last year I retreated a bit into the . Treasury but now I feel I have got a very important message to take to . the people about what we are doing on the economy, and I have got a very . important set of people I need to listen to which is the people of this . country.â July: During his overnight shift meeting workers, Mr Osborne wore matching hi-vis jacket and trousers to admire the tarmac being laid on a section of the M6 motorway near Birmingham . July: Workers lined up to shake the Chancellor's hand in the middle of the night . July: Mr Osborne said he wanted to thank the people who work around the clock to keep the economy on track . July: Mr Osborne said the economy was picking up as he had a go on a forklift truck at Tesco's National Distribution Centre near Rugby . July: Mr Osborne said he wanted to put night workers in the spotlight . July: A lorry driver chats with the Chancellor outside Warburtons Bakery in Wednesbury near Birmingham . It began in . January with a low profile visit to tour the factory of train wheel . manufacturers Lucchini UK in Manchester, where his blue vest would be . best described as âlow-visâ. On . the campaign trail during the Eastleigh by-election he wore orange, . before donning yellow to tour a building site the day after this yearâs . better-received Budget. In July Mr Osborneâs commitment to hi-vis peaked when he spent a shift visiting night workers across the Midlands. September: A green hard that was teamed with an orange hi-vis boiler suit for a visit to the Montrose Platform in the North Sea . September: Mr Osborne used the visit to pay pay tribute to the victims of the North Sea helicopter crash .

He . watched bread coming off the production line at Warburtons, sat in a . forklift truck, met workers laying tarmac on the M6 and chatted with . lorry drivers. In September he teamed a bright green hard hat with an orange boiler suit to visit the Montrose Platform in the North Sea. And . last month Mr Osborne debuted a hi-vis orange t-shirt and shin guards . during a visit to Thoresby Colliery in Nottinghamshire. November: Touring Thoresby Colliery in Nottinghamshire, Mr Osborne met miner Dave Hawells, who bore an uncanny similarity to U2 frontman Bono . November: In addition to a yellow hard hat, and hi-vis jacket and trousers, Mr Osborne also wore hi-vis shin guards and later a hi-vis t-shirt . November: Mr Osborne was given a tour of the mineshaft, as he announced he was protecting a fund which gives ex-miners free coal . Earlier this month Mr Osborne was vindicated in thinking the economy had turned the corner, when the Office for Budget Responsibility more than doubled its growth forecasts for 2013. It now expects the economy to expand by 1.4 per cent, up from 0.6 per cent predicted in March. Mr Osborne confidently told the Commons that âBritain is moving againâ. And the next day he celebrated by pulling on a bright yellow vest to visit a JCB factory in Staffordshire. December: Mr Osborne uses a stud gun during his visit to JCB's backhoe loader factory . December: He tried his hand at operating some of the machinery at the factory in Rocester, Staffordshire, although his hi-vis green vest clashed with the yellow JCB cab .

Britain could pull out of the European Court of Human Rights because it has lost its legitimacy, Chris Grayling announced yesterday. The Tory Party will publish draft legislation over the ânext few monthsâ to rein in the influence of the Strasbourg court, the Justice Secretary revealed. Mr Grayling admitted the Government will not act before the election because changes would be opposed by the Liberal Democrats. But he said the Conservatives would go into the national poll with plans to âcurtailâ the role of the court in the UK, âreplaceâ the Human Rights Act introduced by Labour and make the British Supreme Court supreme over UK law. Mr Grayling said he had no argument with the European Convention on Human Rights, the body of principles that Britain helped draw up after the Second World War. He praised its âsensible balanceâ of rights and responsibilities. But he said the Tories would act to stem the creeping tide of interference by the ECHR in the way they implement the convention. He told Radio 4âs Today Programme: âWhatever we try to do as a party â because this is not an issue that unites the Coalition â the Conservative Partyâs intention is to go into the next election with a clear plan for change. âIt is absolutely clear Parliament has the sovereign right to implement that change should it choose to do so. We have been looking at a number of options, of which leaving the Convention is one. âItâs not the only option we are considering and we will bring forward plans in the next few weeks which will set out very clearly what we will do and how we will do it. âLater in the year we will publish a draft bill which will set out precisely how that legal change will take place.â Mr Grayling spoke out after former Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge warned that the European Court of Human Rights is undermining Parliamentâs sovereignty. The Tory Party will publish draft legislation over the 'next few months' to rein in the influence of the Strasbourg court, the Justice Secretary revealed . The Justice Secretary said: âWe have to curtail the role of the court in the UK, we have to replace the Human Rights Act, which as Lord Judge rightly says is one of the key reasons why the European Court of Human Rights seems to have such sway in the UK. 'We have got to ensure there is a balance of rights and responsibilities in our laws â and that balance of rights and responsibilities does exist in the original convention. âAnd above all, we have to make our Supreme Court supreme. I do not believe decisions about the way this country is governed â we are a democracy after all â should be taken elsewhere.â Mr Grayling spoke out as one of the countryâs leading retail bosses said the European Union had become âhungry for powerâ. Lord Wolfson, a Conservative peer, said that the EU needed to change in the âdirection of free trade rather than a government of governmentsâ. âThe question about whether we stay in or out depends on whether it changes enough,â the Next boss told the Today programme.","The Tory Party will publish draft legislation over the ânext few monthsâ

EU officials are off sick three times more than the average British worker, it was revealed last night. According to official figures, European Commission officials took an average of 14.6 days off sick last year - triple the amount taken by British workers in the private sector. One in seven staff were absent from more than 20 days. Often sick: EU employees, shown here on strike last year, took an average of 14.6 days sick per year . In contrast, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry found British staff working in the privatesector took around five sick days a year. The figures also showed European officials even outstripped Britainâs civil servants and public sector staff - who took half as many days off work. Peter Bone, a prominent Eurosceptic Conservative MP, told the Telegraph the figures were âdisgracefulâ. He said: âIâm appalled at the waste of money. It is unbelievable that they are taking so much time off. However, . nobody in truth would notice whether they are there or not. They have . no real job, they are just pushing bits of paper around and costing . taxpayers billions of pounds.â Perks: Those who work for the European Commission, led by Jose Manuel Barroso (pictured), have high pay and preferential tax arrangements . Pieter . Cleppe, of the Open Europe think tank, said that the levels of illness . among European commission staff was âsurprisingâ given their higher pay . and perks. He said: âThat . EU officials are off sick so often is surprising, especially when they . are paid more, taxed less and tend to have better conditions than either . civil servants in member states or people working in the private . sector.â . EU staff - 14.6 sick days per year . UK workers (private sector) - 4.9 days . UK workers (public sector) - 6.9 days . German workers - 19.3 days . European average - 7.3 days . Between 3.5 and 3.7 per cent of working days were lost to sickness overall. But the commission said this was a figure in line with other European countries. The average European worker takes 7.3 days off work each year, according to figures compiled this year by PwC - precisely half the figure for EU staff. Only Germany, out of the Western European countries, appears to have a substantially worse sickness absence problem than EU officialdom, with officials taking an average of 19.3 days off sick last year. According to British figures, EU officials are well paid, with 16 per cent of administrative staff at the commission earning more than Â£84,000 a year. These are paid at low âcommunityâ tax rates of around 20 per cent. On top of high wages, staff receive annual holidays of 24 days as well as seven days off for public holidays and, this year, eight ânon-workingâ days out of the office when the Brussels institutions are closed in summer and at Christmas. Many commission staff are also eligible for a âflexitimeâ scheme that gives an extra 24 days off work every year for those that put in an extra 45 minutes a day in the office.","Official figures show one is seven staff were absent for more than 20 days .

The controversial Labour peer in charge of the EUâs new diplomatic service was facing fresh charges of waste last night after figures revealed that she employs nearly 500 chauffeurs â including one paid Â£62,000 a year. Baroness Ashton, who has faced repeated charges of profligacy since being plucked from obscurity to be the EUâs first âforeign ministerâ, paid one chauffeur a basic salary of almost Â£5,200 a month â equal to an annual salary of more than Â£62,000 a year. The EUâs diplomatic service now employs almost 500 drivers to ferry officials between meetings, with many of them on lavish salaries, figures released to the European Parliament show. Baroness Ashton who is paid a salary of more than Â£250,000 as well as lavish expenses, is the highest paid female politician in the world . The most expensive vehicle bought for the diplomatic service cost Â£182,695. The figures also show that chauffeurs clocked up 30,000 miles last year with no-one in the back of the car. Baroness Ashton, who is paid a salary . of more than Â£250,000 as well as lavish expenses, is the highest paid . female politician in the world. Her income is similar to that of US . President Barack Obama. She also enjoys the use of a bulletproof car with two chauffeurs, and a lavish grace-and-favour home in Brussels. The total budget of her European External Action Service (EEAS) went up by 5.7 per cent last year to Â£442million, with Britainâs share of the bill increasing to about Â£58million. Tory MEP Marina Yannakoudakis said the figures made a mockery of Lady Ashtonâs claim that she was running a lean operation. She added: âThe EEAS was meant to be budget neutral, yet this year Baroness Ashton has asked for Â£20million more to run her expensive, inefficient and unproductive diplomatic service. âLast month George Osborne announced that the UKâs Foreign and Commonwealth Office would need to make savings of 6 per cent. The European Union and Baroness Ashton should be expected to do the same. âThese figures show the service now has four drivers per EU embassy â that is completely unwarranted. Salaries of over Â£60,000 are unreasonable and an army of chauffeurs driving empty cars and spitting out tonnes of carbon dioxide makes a sham of the EUâs commitment to reduce climate change.â The revelations are embarrassing for Lady Ashton, who has faced diplomatic grumblings that she is too low-profile to make an impact on the world stage. She was appointed as part of an extraordinary stitch-up in 2009, which saw equally obscure Belgian Herman van Rompuy appointed as the EUâs first president, after EU leaders rejected more high-profile figures who might steal their thunder. The two jobs were both created by the Lisbon Treaty. Critics claim say both are a waste of money. Lady Ashton has faced diplomatic grumblings that she is too low-profile to make an impact on the world stage . The new figures reveal that the EEAS has 484 drivers operating out of 141 EU âembassiesâ around the world as well as Brussels. The highest-paid driver works in Geneva. Lady Ashton said the EEAS had had to buy several bulletproof cars for use in danger zones, which accounted for the decision to spend Â£182,000 on a single vehicle. She said the highest sum spent on a non-armoured vehicle was Â£42,000. A Brussels source said EU diplomats frequently asked their chauffeurs to travel vast distances to collect them when they travelled by plane. The source added: âYou get cases where an official in Ankara will fly to Istanbul and get their driver to travel ahead so they can pick them up and ferry them around. It doesnât seem to matter that the chauffeur is driving miles with no-one on board.â A Commission spokesman said the Â£62,000 salary was âat the extreme end of the scaleâ. He said the average salary was closer to Â£10,000.","EU's diplomatic service now employs almost 500 drivers to ferry officials between meetings .

But in a remarkable turn of events - following a âSave Bobiâ campaign that quickly gathered pace, attracting supporters across the world - the Daily Mail can now reveal that he will be saved. The dog, who is partially paralysed will now be cared for and given daily medical treatment by Canine Rescue - the charity that saved him from Bulgaria - before it is decided if he will be rehomed. Born survivor: Bobi is finally able to enjoy his new life in Britain after a vet declared he should not be put down . Worldwide support: This appeal by K9 Rescue prompted a successful campaign to save the disabled dog . Yesterday the paper told how the . disabled dog had been brought to Britain by the charity who discovered . him severely crippled and close to death. With the help of the public, they funded his medical treatment and several vets deemed him fit enough to be rehomed. He . then had a brief period with a foster carer who struggled to cope with . the demands of having a disabled dog with incontinence and then was . rehomed with Jayne Jones, a manager for Canine Rescue. But the . partially paralysed dog was taken from his new home by an RSPCA . officer â just two hours after arriving there on Friday. Miss Jones later received a phone call to say a vet had decided Bobi was too unwell and must be put down the following day. This was despite a video taken days earlier showing the him happily playing and jumping around. Canine . Rescue workers described the RSPCA as âbarbaricâ, saying the charityâs . answer to everything is to kill, rather than working with the animals to . make them better.

Battle for survival: Yesterday the Daily Mail highlighted the plight of the terrier  who was rescued from starvation in Bulgaria, but condemned by the RSPCA because he was not fit enough to lead a happy life . Saved: Bobi, who has paralysed legs and has to wear nappies, will now be allowed to live following an examination by Langford Veterinary Services in Bristol. However, he will require constant care and medication . Last night, more than 9,000 people had signed a petition on campaigning website, Change.org.

German-born aviation pioneer Gustave Whitehead is finally getting recognition after Connecticut legislators have passed a bill insisting he flew two years before the Wright brothers . Connecticut legislators have passed a bill insisting that a Connecticut aviator flew two years before the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, N.C. The measure is the latest twist in an effort to credit the first successful airplane flight to German-born aviator and Bridgeport resident Gustave Whitehead. He was born in Leutershausen, Bavaria as Gustave Weisskopf. As a boy, he showed an interest in flight, experimenting with kites and earning the nickname 'the flyer'. His parents died in 1886 and 1887, when he was still a boy. He then trained as a mechanic and traveled to Hamburg, where in 1888 he was forced to join the crew of a sailing ship. After several years at sea he arrived in the U.S. in 1893 and anglicized his name to Gustave Whitehead. The bill honors what it calls the first powered flight by Whitehead in 1901, ârather than the Wright brothers.â Whitehead is credited by some for the first flight in August 1901. The Wright brothers lifted off from North Carolina in December 1903. âWe want to correct something that should have been corrected long ago,â said state Rep. Larry Miller, R-Stratford, who spearheaded the legislation. âAll we're trying to do is correct history. There's nothing in it for us.â Tom Crouch, senior curator for aeronautics at the Smithsonian Institution, which displays Wilbur and Orville Wright's plane at the National Air and Space Museum, said Whitehead's backers are âabsolutely wrong.â Pioneer: This undated picture shows Gustave Whitehead with daughter Rose in front of his 'No. 21', which reportedly sailed more than a mile two years before the Wright Brothers took off . âWhitehead's legend has spawned much speculation and hearsay,â he said. âPeople who have looked at this over the years... almost unanimously reject the claim.â Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has not committed to signing the legislation, but will . review it when it reaches his desk, a spokesman said. Whitehead's wife Louise wasnât a big fan of his obsession with flying. In 1940 she gave an interview to The Bridgeport Sunday Post in which she . said her husband's first words upon returning home from Fairfield on 14 . August 1901, were an excited, 'Mama, we went up!' Mrs. Whitehead said her husband was always busy with motors and flying . machines when he was not working in coal yards or factories. The interview quoted her as saying, 'I hated to see him put so much time . and money into that work.' History rewritten: Wilbur and Orville Wright face being written out of history now that the Whitehead story has been given credability . Whitehead designed an aircraft in the . early 1900s that could be driven like a car, but was fitted with wings . that could be unfolded, turning the car into a plane. He envisaged owners being able to drive . the car to a field, or suitable runway and then unfold wings on the side . of the vehicle that would then turn the car into a plane. Whitehead then built his Condor aircraft, also known as No.21, based on this flying car model. The aircraft had two . engines; a 20 horsepower engine used to fly the vehicle, and a 10 . horsepower engine used for driving. The idea was that the pilot could switch between engines depending on whether they wanted to drive or fly the vehicle. Condor was also fitted with two propellers that were controlled and powered when the plane engine was selected. Reports in the Bridgeport Herald in . August 1901 claim Whitehead drove the Condor to a field outside . Connecticut, unfolded the wings and made two demonstration . flights. During the second flight, Whitehead is said to have flown for a mile and a half and reached a height of 50 feet. Further reports claim he updated the . model, called No.22, and made another demonstration flight on 22 January . 1902 in front of 17 witnesses. Mrs. Whitehead said her husband's aviation . efforts took their toll on the family budget and she had to work to help . meet expenses. She said she never saw any of her husband's reported flights. Connecticut . has a long and storied history in aviation. Aircraft engines were made . at Pratt and Whitney in East Hartford beginning in 1925, and a desk used . by Charles Lindbergh is still on display at the jet engine . manufacturer. And famed helicopter maker Igor Sikorsky set up shop in . Stratford in 1929 to make seaplanes. A . recent burst of interest in Whitehead followed a documentary by an . Australian historian, John Brown. In addition, Whitehead Research . Committees in the United States and Germany have stoked interest. Jane's . All the World's Aircraft, an influential industry publication, recently . cited contemporary news accounts in concluding that Whitehead beat the . brothers from Dayton, Ohio, into the air. Andrew Kosch, a high school science teacher in Milford, said he has been working 30 years to promote Whitehead's achievement. He lobbied the legislature and even . persuaded Chip's Family Restaurant in Fairfield to name an omelet the . No. 21, for the plane Whitehead flew. A report in the Bridgeport Herald on 18 August 1901 details eyewitness accounts of Whitehead's flight, which took place in Connecticut four days earlier. The journalist confirms that the flight took off from Fairfield, flew for about a mile and a half, made two turns and then landed safely . He said the aviator is well-known in Connecticut for flying before the Wright brothers and the world now needs to know it. âHow can you prove someone didn't fly? That's what the Smithsonian is trying to do,â Kosch said. He . and Miller said the Smithsonian is forbidden by a contract with the . executors of the Wright brothers' estate to admit that anyone else was . the first to fly. Crouch . said the Smithsonian signed a contract with two heirs of the Wright . brothers' estate in 1948, after the brothers' deaths. The heirs insisted . on the provision, he said, because they fought a fraudulent claim of . early flights for 20 years. It doesn't change what he said is the fact that Wilbur and Orville Wright operated the first heavier-than-air machine. âWhat . they achieved changed the face of the world,â he said. âThey were the . ones who took those final steps. They deserve the credit for it.â Kosch will not be persuaded to reject Whitehead. âI do everything I can to keep the story alive,â he said.","Bavaria-born Gustave Whitehead is belatedly winning recognition as the original aviation pioneer .

"By . Paul Newman In Melbourne . PUBLISHED: . 22:27 EST, 28 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:32 EST, 29 December 2013 . This was the worst yet. A wretched, gruesome numbing defeat that not only leaves an Australian Ashes whitewash very much on but also signals, more than the other three emphatic thrashings, the end of a great era for this England team. Australiaâs easy, no-nonsense eight-wicket victory within four days at the MCG is a new low simply because England threw the game away in the most culpable manner, as shamefully as anything seen in the darkest days of English cricket. This fourth Test, with the Ashes gone, was meant to be the start of something new for England, the first steps with a clean slate towards attempting to regain the urn when these old enemies meet yet again in just 18 months time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Paul Newman: One of the lowest points in English cricket . Dismal: England lost heavily at the MCG to go 4-0 down in the series as they stare a whitewash in the face . All smiles: Chris Rogers (left) made a hundred and Shane Watson a fifty as Australia sauntered to their win . Oops: Alastair Cook dropped two catches - the second an absolute sitter to give David Warner a reprieve . Lonely? Cook's captaincy, particularly his negativity, has come into question during this doomed series . And it was meant to be the start of Alastair Cook taking real control and starting to mould his own England side in his own way, not just following the tried and tested methods of Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower. Instead England betrayed a collective scrambled state of mind and a complete lack of confidence with a woeful display that sees them, incredulously, 4-0 down against an Australian team who had not won in nine Tests before this series. England had their chances here far more than they had in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. Twice they were in position with the bat to finally put pressure on what remains a brittle Australian side only to blow it in as hapless way as can be. There is no defence for a first innings score of 255, made timidly, after Michael Clarke had gifted them the chance to move into a commanding position by taking a real gamble in asking England to bat. And there is absolutely no defence for what must surely be the worst day of this tortuous tour, the third of this Test, when England went into Saturday as clear favourites to win only to firstly let Australiaâs last pair add 40 and then capitulate recklessly to 179 all out losing the last five wickets for just six runs. Despite it all England still had hope in the morning session, particularly as Australia have proved themselves very nervous chasers in recent times, but it was quickly distinguished with two terrible fielding howlers in the first half hour. How different this Test might still have been had Jonny Bairstow gone for the regulation chance to his left offered by Chris Rogers on 19 and then had Cook, perhaps still fazed by his keeperâs poor judgment, not dropped an absolute dolly to reprieve David Warner when he was on 22. It was a passage of play that highlighted Englandâs muddled selectorial thinking in bringing Bairstow here as back-up keeper when there are not many who view him as Matt Priorâs successor and then the captainâs scrambled brain. Stay hit! Chris Rogers was in free-scoring form as he passed fifty in the morning session . Got him! Jonny Bairstow caught Warner off Ben Stokes' bowling but it was too little too late from the tourists . Held aloft: Rogers celebrates his fifty, which came up in 73 balls, and the opener rarely looked threatened . Hero: Rogers was exemplary in scoring a ton and seeing Australia through the majority of their second innings . Top knock: Rogers scored a cluster of his runs backward of square on the offside, as shown by our hawk-eye . Carry on: Shane Watson was in at No 3 and continued where Warner had left off, scoring quick runs at the MCG . Warner, who rarely performs when he is actually under pressure, soon gave it away to give Ben Stokes, the one ray of hope from this series, a deserved wicket but the journeyman Rogers, one of cricketâs nice guys, made England pay. And Englandâs body language betrayed a beaten, embarrassed side long before Rogers, missed again by Bairstow on 81, moved on to a popular century and Shane Watson and Clarke, passing 8,000 Test runs, then completed the highest successful run-chase at the MCG in 50 years with contemptible ease. It is hard to see England raising themselves for one last push after this and if they do indeed lose in Sydney next week this would be a much more humiliating 5-0 reverse than that suffered here in 2006-07. Back then England had lost the spine of the side that won the Ashes so famously in 2005 and were up against some truly great Australian players, led by Ricky Ponting, who were hell-bent on revenge. This, at least judging by the last five years, is a much better England side than Andrew Flintoffâs vintage and they are up against an ageing Australian team who had a similar Test record to Zimbabwe in 2013 before England arrived. Toil: Stokes was England's main threat but even he found it tough going against the unforgiving Aussies . Tried and trusted? Cook opted to go with Joe Root instead of frontline spinner Monty Panesar for long spells . Clearly, though, Cook was right when he said before this match that maybe Englandâs 3-0 victory last summer had merely papered over the cracks both in the England side and his own captaincy. England made a habit of claiming the big moments last summer against an Australian side who had seemed to have forgotten how to get over the line but this time it has been Clarke who has had the upper hand in everything he has done. Big change now seems far more likely at the end of this series than it did after Perth. A lack of energy, imagination, tactical acumen and, yes, heart and desire appear far more worrying here than in the aftermath of losing the Ashes. Swann has gone, there are question marks over whether Jonathan Trott and Matt Prior will play for England again and there are those like Bairstow, Michael Carberry, Tim Bresnan, Monty Panesar and Chris Tremlett who could conceivably disappear after this tour. And who will remain to coach them is a moot point also. Crestfallen: Stuart Broad saw an early catch go down and looked a beaten man in the field for the tourists . Smother: Rogers batted sensibly and showed the England middle order how to carry an innings . It is hard, for instance, to see Graham Gooch carrying on as batting coach after this. One of the greatest of all servants of English cricket will surely be too proud to watch the batsmen continually letting him and their country down. And what Flower would make of a 5-0 reverse is key to what England do next. I remain convinced that there is no-one better equipped to guide England towards a new era than the greatest coach England have had but will Flower feel that he has to be held accountable more than anyone and step down? There is no appetite within the ECB for Flower to go but new managing director Paul Downton may have a fight to persuade him to stay when he arrives in Sydney to begin a term as managing director that he could never have imagined would start in a crisis such as this when he succeeded Hugh Morris. Nobody better? England ought to stick by their coach Andy flower despite the humiliation Down Under . Happy as Larry! The Australian tactics had Darren Lehmann's aggressive stamp all over them during this series . There are questions, too, facing a selection panel which has got so much right over the last five years. James Whitaker takes over as national selector having to explain how England have ended up with the wrong back-up keeper, three giant bowlers who could not be trusted to play and three spinners in the squad in Panesar, Scott Borthwick and James Tredwell but no Swann. It is a sorry old mess and one that has escalated beyond all comprehension over these past few testing weeks. Last time they were at the MCG three years ago they retained the Ashes and did the sprinkler dance in front of a delighted Barmy Army. This same England team have unravelled this time in a most brutal fashion here and the time has clearly come for them to start again.","England facing humiliating series whitewash after another dismal defeat .

The father of the 16-year-old California girl who was brutally gang-raped by as many as 20 men told a jury Tuesday about the horrifying moment he realized his child had been assaulted. He recounted how he received a vulgar call from his daughter's cell phone from one of her attackers who boasted how good she was at sex. The dad raced to the school and was soon approached by a police officer who called him by his name. 'When he addressed me (by my name), I started to buckle because I had not given my name,"" the father said.

As the victim passed by on a gurney, the father saw her horribly beaten face and the vomit that was in her hair, the Mercury News said. 'I told her that we loved her very much and to hold on,' he said. 'I could see she was not conscious enough to respond back.' The father was the first witness in the trial of Jose Montano, 22,Â  and Marcelles Peter, 20, who each face life in prison if convicted. 'I'm envisioning it, and it was a horror,' the dad said. Prosecutors also said how two condoms, a can of energy drink and a Four Loko were found at the scene. On Monday, Contra Costa County Deputy District Attorney John Cope delivered a graphic opening statement yesterday in which he described how police found the girl propped up by a . metal beam under a picnic table half-naked and bloodied. She was . 'incoherent and barely conscious' and covered in alcohol, urine and . dirt. Cope said Peter took part in the more than two-hour assault on the girl after she was plied with alcohol. She had a blood alcohol level of .35 and has no memory of the attack. Accused: Marcelles Peter, 20, left, and Jose Montano, 22, right, are standing trial in Richmond for their part in the shocking gang rape of a 16-year-old girl at her homecoming dance in 2009 .

Participants: John Crane Jr, 43, left, turned himself into police after the incident and Elvis Torrentes, right, faces charges including aiding the act of rape that could land him in prison for 26 years . Opening statements are scheduled today for another defendant in the case, Jose Montano, 22, from Richmond. Both men are being tried in front of dual juries. Peter is charged with three criminal . counts of forcible rape, rape by foreign object and forced oral . copulation. Each count alleges that he acted in concert with others and . inflicted great bodily injuries on the victim. Montano faces similar charges. Cope described the series of events that unraveled on October 24, 2009. The victim, feeling bored and hot, left the school dance and went outside to phone her father when she encountered a male classmate who asked her if she wanted to come and 'party' with them. After drinking brandy with the boys, things took a turn for the worst, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Richmond High School: Students walk past a sign during gym class before a rally and vigil concerning the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl outside of Richmond High School's homecoming dance in 2009 . Witnesses will testify that the victim was punched, kicked and dragged around the area. She was assaulted with a walkie-talkie and someone urinated on her. Others watching were invited to join in. As many as 20 men are thought to have participated in the attack, Cope told the jury, with one even answering the girl's cell phone and telling her father how good his daughter was at sexual acts. Peter's attorney Gordon Brown told the jury in his opening statement that DNA evidence found in a condom at the scene was unreliable and that the crime scene had been compromised. He said that wind from the helicopter could have compromised evidence at the scene and carried Peter's DNA from a beer can to a broken used condom found in the courtyard. 'I don't think we will ever know all that happened,' Brown told the jury. Manuel Ortega and Ari Morales agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years, respectively. They are expected to testify against Peter and Montano. Two others, John Crane Jr and Elvis Torrentes, still await trial.","Father is first witness called in trial .

When Google was criticised for not doing enough to block child porn on the internet, it hit back by making great play of its support for online watchdog the Internet Watch Foundation. Yesterday the extent of that support was revealed â a donation of just Â£20,000 or equivalent to 90 secondsâ profit for the internet giant. The Cambridge-based charity, which seeks to police child abuse images online, is so short of funds that its five staff are unable to keep up with the number of websites being reported. 'Library': Mark Bridger (right) had compiled a collection of sickening images before killing April Jones (left) Google has already come under fire for paying just Â£6million in corporation tax in the UK, despite sales worth Â£3.2billion in 2011. Critics say the foundation would be able to take much more effective action against child abuse sites if internet companies gave them more money. Other web firms are no more generous than Google, according to the charityâs accounts. Facebook donated about Â£10,000, while Microsoftâs Bing search engine gave about Â£20,000. Liz Longhurst, whose daughter Jane was murdered by pornography addict Graham Coutts in 2003, said internet firms must âget their act togetherâ and start tackling violent online imagery. âWhat annoys me immensely is that Google wonât block these sites,â she said. âThey say weâve got to have freedom. All I ask them is where was my daughterâs freedom â tell me that.â Web companies are under increased scrutiny following the conviction of Mark Bridger, who was jailed for life for the murder of five-year-old April Jones. He had collected a âlibraryâ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on Google and Bing in the weeks before the abduction. Both he and Stuart Hazell, who murdered 12-year-old Tia Sharp, had no previous convictions for sexual offences and progressed from viewing child porn on the internet to committing child murder. Viewed child porn: Stuart Hazell (right) had searched for images online before killing 12-year-old Tia Sharp (left) Last week Peter Davies, chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre (CEOP), warned it did not have the resources to track down all users of internet child porn. And on Friday, Vince Cable, the Lib Dem Business Secretary, became the first Cabinet member to call for Google to be âmore proactive in policing what is thereâ. Labourâs media spokesman Helen Goodman said last night: âGoogleâs donation of Â£20,000 to the IWF cannot hide the fact that they paid only Â£6million in tax at a time when the police lack the resources to arrest everyone they know is downloading child abuse images. âBringing Bridger to trial cost Â£9million. What we need is urgent Government action on this.â Google has used its membership of the foundation to justify taking little action to proactively block child porn on the web. Last month, when a group of charities demanded urgent action to prevent access to illegal and âdisgustingâ child pornography via web browsers, a Google statement read: âWe are members and joint funders of the Internet Watch Foundation.â But the revelation that its funding amounts to just Â£20,000 has infuriated critics. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, called on internet companies to do far more to ensure the foundation is properly resourced. He said: âI am shocked that, despite the importance they have said they place on its role in keeping our children safe, they have donated such paltry amounts to it, which for them represent a drop in the ocean. âAs it stands, it is difficult to take their commitment to protecting our children seriously.â The foundation and its five-strong . team of analysts are being overwhelmed as reports of child abuse sites . soared by 40 per cent compared with last year, to 40,000 â or 150 a day. Sir Richard Tilt, chairman of the . charityâs board of trustees, said: âThereâs certainly scope for . increasing our number of analysts and we know if we had more analysts we . could do better. If we could get more money that would enable us to do . more.â Donation: Google has given Â£20,000 to a Cambridge-based internet porn watchdog - the equivalent to 90 seconds' profit . John Carr, of the Childrenâs Charities Coalition on Internet Safety, said: âGoogleâs moral leadership is essential here. They are the biggest player in this space in the world. âThey can and should be proactive â if they did it, I think others would have to follow.â Last night Google said the Â£20,000 was merely a membership fee. The company said it had given the charityâs US counterpart, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, millions of dollars. Scott Rubin, director of communications and public policy outside the US, said: âGoogle has a zero-tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content. We are members and joint funders of the Internet Watch Foundation â an independent body that searches the web for child abuse imagery and then sends us links, which we remove from our search index. âWhen we discover child abuse imagery or are made aware of it, we respond quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.â Labour has demanded that ministers force Google to filter out horrific child porn websites from its searches. The party has unveiled a three-point plan which would make the search engine take tough action to prevent the perpetrators of vile child sex attacks from accessing such sites. Media spokesman Helen Goodman said that if she were in power she would force Google to put up warning messages before people enter websites containing unlawful child porn images. She said that if a warning that such sites were illegal flashed up, it would act as a deterrent from looking at them in future. There is evidence that once people start looking at such images, they then seek out more and more hard-core examples. Labour would also ensure that no one could see adult sites if they were underage by putting in place the same sort of strict age verification check in place on gambling websites. As well as protecting children, this will also force people to hand over identifiable details about themselves â such as credit card details â so they can be tracked down by police if need be. Finally, Miss Goodman said: âThe industry should be making safe searches the default, instead of expecting people to download the filters themselves.â The internet industry says there should be few restrictions on porn because it is not illegal. But Miss Goodman said that in the real world, outside the internet, there is no automatic access to adult material.","Internet giant gives just a fraction of its profits to UK porn watchdog .

From algae to bee venom and human placenta, the list of bizarre ingredients added to beauty creams is a long one. Now an anti-ageing gel based on snail slime has become the latest celebrity must-have - and is flying off the shelves as a result. According to retailers, sales of the antioxidant gel have increased by a staggering 700 per cent in the last four weeks alone, after Ashley Roberts admitted to using it in an interview. Slimy success: It might sound disgusting but snail mucus is said to have anti-ageing properties . Speaking to Reveal magazine, Roberts claimed that she loves Dr Organic Snail Gel because it keeps her skin 'soft and healthy'. And Roberts isn't alone in her appreciation of the slimy substance: another star to credit the mucus with her healthy glow and perfect complexion is Katie Holmes. The link between snail slime and benefits to skin was uncovered by chance when Chilean snail farmers noticed their skin healed quickly without scarring when they handled snails they were exporting to the French food industry. Since the farmers' discovery, using snail slime in cosmetics has boomed, with Japan, where a live-snail-facial is a premium spa treatment which commands a Â£160 price tag, at the forefront of the trend. The popular Â£19.99 gel contains the same slime, which is harvested by allowing the snails to crawl over specially-built glass and plastic structures. A-list fans: Both Katie Holmes and Ashley Roberts have confessed to using the anti-ageing substance . Healing: The mucus left behind by the snails is believed to have anti-ageing benefits by proponents . Complexion corrector: Dr Organic Snail Gel, Â£19.99, is proving popular with celebrities . The mucus contains proteins, glycolic acids, allantoin, hyaluronic acid and elastin intended help with regeneration and repair of snailsâ membranes and shells.Trials have investigated the healing properties of snail secretion slime, with one conducted on burns victims concluding that the ingredient was 'a natural, safe and effective alternative treatment in open wound management of partial thickness burns in adults.' 'Although it might appear unusual at first, going back to source can uncover some of natureâs best and most effective solutions,' commented Lucy Pottinger, Holland & Barrettâs senior beauty buyer. 'This is particularly true in natural beauty, which has become the fastest growing category in store as customers realise that the products they put on their bodies are just as important as the foods they put in them. 'To avoid too much of an ""eew factor"", we have combined the natural snail gel with Aloe Vera and Lemongrass to ensure it smells and feels as good as it works. 'We have been overwhelmed by how popular this unique beauty product has become and customers have been stocking up on the product in the lead up to key party season when everyone wants to look and feel their best!' Surprisingly, the store says that the product has proved particularly popular with younger customers, who have left enthusiastic comments about the ingredient's moisturising properties on the health retailer's website. Rating Snail Gel five out five in an online review, one customer said 'This stuff is great! I haven't been using it for very long but the results are instant. 'Skin feels lovely and fresh, looks more even toned and the smell is very fresh. I must admit when I first came across it I felt a little squeamish, but itâs worth getting over that!

Trapped: Brianie Copeland, 17, is virtually a prisoner in her own home because of her rare condition . As a result, the teenager is virtually a prisoner in her own home as exposure to the outside world leaves her with blistered skin and painful rashes. 'I have to apply cream two or three times a day and I wear bandages every night to keep the cream on my skin,' explains Brianie. 'I also have to have a bath at least twice a day. If I don't my skin cracks and dries out. It is really painful.' But that's not all. Eating is also a minefield for the teenager, who has to follow a severely limited diet in order to avoid dangerous reactions. 'I have to avoid certain foods such as diary products, wheat, soya, nuts and oats,' she explains. 'If I eat them my throat starts to swell up and close. I also take ten tablets a day.'

She left school with excellent GCSE's and is now studying childcare at New College Durham in the hope of working with children with special needs. 'I grew up wearing bandages constantly so I don't know any different,' she explained. 'People say to me if there was a cure would I take it but I don't think I would.

Under threat: Charity Plantlife says wildlife habitats are being destroyed by councils incessantly mowing down and trimming grass verges . Valuable wildlife habitats are being destroyed by councils incessantly mowing down and trimming grass verges in the UK, a charity has warned. Plantlife is calling for better management of the 600,000 acres of roadside verges across the country, which it says should be treated as hay meadows and only cut twice a year. The verges support up to 1,000 plant species including the rare bastard balm and long-leaved helleborine which are among 33 wayside flowers facing extinction. Wildflowers found in such verges are also a vital food source for bees and butterflies which have seen a significant decline in numbers in recent years. The obsessive cutting down of the verges over the spring and summer by highway authorities and councils - driven by a desire for tidiness - has resulted in the destruction of thousands of miles of colourful and important habitats, according to Plantlife. The charity says that stopping the mowing down of roadsides when plants are in flower could result in a massive boost for the UKâs wild flowers, bees, butterflies and other insects. Dr Trevor Dines from Plantlife said: âIt is almost ironic that the way we manage our road verges now encourages coarse and thuggish plants. Most verges, smothered in cuttings, might as well be just strips of concrete. âPlantlife receives more calls on this subject than any other, from members of the public distraught and angry that their favourite verges full of cowslips and orchids are being mown down in the name of neatness and good management.â One road verge in Warwickshire has the countryâs largest population of pyramidal orchids and rockrose, the latter of which attracts the scarce brown argus butterfly. The A30 and A38 roads in Cornwall and Devon support more than 1,000 acres of flower-rich grassland and one junction alone is home to six orchid species, including bee orchids and 1,100 greater butterfly orchids. The charity says that the verges should be cut - and the cuttings removed - once early in the year and again in the late summer. Rich environment: The A30 in Cornwall supports hundreds of acres of flower-rich grassland . However, a survey by the charity found they were cut multiple times by the majority of councils over the summer while none of the councils collected the cuttings. This allows the cuttings to rot down and add nitrate to the soil making it less compatible for wildflowers. The Local Government Association (LGA) said keeping verges trimmed is safer for both drivers and pedestrians. LGA environment and housing board chairman Mike Jones told the BBC that Britainâs wild flowers were important and councils encouraged native species âwhere they canâ. âHowever, councils must strike the right balance between road safety and wildlife. Keeping road verges well maintained ensures that motorists have a good line of sight and allows pedestrians to walk more safely alongside busy roads,â he added. Rare sight: One road verge in Warwickshire has the country's largest population of pyramidal orchids and rockrose, the latter of which attracts the scarce brown argus butterfly . But Plantlife says that nearly all species benefiting from hay meadow management grow no higher than a foot. Andy Byfield, landscape conservation manager for Plantlife, told the Independent on Sunday: âCutting within a metre of the road and at junctions is fair enough.â Britain has 937 square miles of verges, a total almost twice the size of Exmoor and the New Forest national parks combined. Mr Byfield added: âThe area of roadside verges we have in the country is the same size as the public forest estate, the projected sell-off of which provoked such a huge row. So why not also get worked up about saving a similarly large and important area for wildlife?â Some councils do manage to protect selected verges for wild flowers including West Sussex County Council which maintains a list of ânotable road vergesâ. Plantlife said it is also working with several other councils, including Worcestershire and Hampshire, to protect plants including Deptford pinks and tower mustard. A Highways Agency spokesperson said: âWe have sown and planted more than 100 hectares of wild flowers and companion grasses on new road schemes in the past 20 years to act as a seed source to colonise wider areas. Our approach to management is to use a light touch.â","Charity calls for better management of roadside verges .

A newly released police interview video shows George Zimmerman's girlfriend describing in detail how the former neighborhood watch volunteer pointed a shotgun at her face and choked her last month. Weeks later, Samantha Scheibe recanted her story, saying she felt intimidated by police and coerced into saying that Zimmerman threatened her. Prosecutors subsequently declined to charge Zimmerman and the couple were seen retrieving his guns together, smiling. But on November 19, as Ms Scheibe sat with a Sanford, Florida, police detective, she calmly said that Zimmerman retrieved his pump-action shotgun from a weapons bag and pointed at it from just a few feet away when she threatened to call police. The 27-year-old blonde also told a story, with no prompting, about how Zimmerman choked her during a fight a week and a half earlier - wrapping his hands around her throat until she had trouble breathing and her voice became hoarse. Interview: Samathan Scheibe, left, demonstrates to a detective how George Zimmerman allegedly shoved a shotgun in her face during a fight last month . Happy together? Weeks after the interview, Ms Scheibe recanted her story. She was seen walking with Zimmerman outside the Sanford, Florida, police station after prosecutors announced he would not be charged . When asked why she didn't call the police that time, Ms Scheibe responded: 'Because I feel like he always gets off, to be honest.' Zimmerman, 30, has been in the public eye since February 2012, when he shot and killed unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. He was acquitted of all charged this summer after claiming acted in self defense. In the interview, Ms Scheibe describes how the couple began to fight after she told Zimmerman she was kicking him out of her house. He began to pack his things, including two firearms, an AR15 assault rifle and a Kel-Tec pump shotgun. 'As I started to move his stuff out, he got agitated. He went to the rifle bag, he unlocked it, immediate pulled out the first gun in the bag, which is on top, which is the Kel-Tec,' she told the detective. 'He pointed it at me for a second and said 'Do you really want to do this?' Because I'd told him that I'd call the cops. 'He was trying to scare me out of not calling.' In the interview, Scheibe said Zimmerman pointed his Kel-Tec shotgun (pictured) at her. She wasn't sure whether it was loaded or not . At the request of the detective, she took and demonstrated with her hands how Zimmerman pointed the weapon at her. She said she didn't know whether it was loaded and estimates he was about four feet from her at the time. The interview reveals a tumultuous relationship between Zimmerman and Ms Scheibe, who have been seeing each other since August. She says this wasn't the first time she had threatened the kick Zimmerman out of her house. In September, Zimmerman's wife Shellie - who stood by his side and hid out with him during the Trayvon Martin trial - announced that she was divorcingÂ Zimmerman. Also in September, he was detained by police after an altercation with Shellie in which she claimed he threatened her and her father with a gun. He was not charged, though, because he allegedly smashed her iPad, which contained video of the incident. Ms Scheibe says the fight started because Zimmerman was jealous of her ex-boyfriend. 'He was jealous over my ex,' she told the detective. 'Because (the ex-boyfriend) had been texting me and I'd been responding because he's not biologically the father of my daughter, but he's been dad to her for ten years. We were together eight year.' In his fury, she says, Zimmerman used the butt of the shotgun to smash her glass coffee table and her sunglasses, which her ex-boyfriend had given to her. He then pointed the shotgun at her a second time and shoved her out the front door of her own house, slammed the door and locked out her, she said. When the detective asked whether Ms Scheibe felt afraid of Zimmerman, she responded: 'Yes and no. Strained: Scheibe said she had previously threatened to kick Zimmerman out of her house - but never actually went through with it . Ms Scheibe, a 27-year-old single mother, has been dating Zimmerman since August . Zimmerman and wife Shellie are in the process of divorcing. She announced she was leaving him in September - though he's been seeing Scheibe since August . 'No because he's locked up right now. 'Yes because he just lost the only person that had his back so he's got nothing to lose.' In the end of the interview, after the detective leaves the room, Ms Scheibe can be heard telling a victim advocate, 'I feel like I've been through this a hundred times and I get so scared that I'm leavign something out.' Days after the interview, Zimmerman's lawyer filed an affidavit signed by Ms Scheibe. In it, she says, 'I do not want George Zimmerman charged.' 'When I was being questioned by police I felt very intimidated...I believe that the police misinterpreted me and that I may have misspoken about certain facts in my statement to police.' She said that Zimmerman never threatened her or pointed a gun at her. She adds that she 'wants to be with' him. Prosecutors subsequently announced that they would not file charges against Zimmerman. The pair are believed to still be together.","George Zimmerman was arrested November 19 after girlfriend Samantha Scheibe called police .

The murder rate in New York City dropped to its lowest level since records began in 2013, and now trails far behind that of America's homicide capital, Chicago. There have been just 332 murders so far this year - a 20 per cent fall from 2012's previous low of 419 slayings and fewer than one a day, outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly announced this week. There were also significantly fewer shootings recorded - 1,100 in 2013 compared to 1,367 in 2012, and overall crime was down 32 per cent for the year to December 29. Crime down: The murder rate in New York City dropped to its lowest level since records began in 2013, outgoing New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured, announced this week . Officials put the drastic drop in murders down to an increase in police on the beat in high-crime zones under Operation Impact. They also claim to have had success focusing on teens affiliated with gangs and crews who are responsible for a third of slayings under Operation Crew Cut. 'New York's crime-fighting strategies have made us America's safest big city â and one that cities across the globe want to learn from,' said Mayor Bloomberg, releasing the statistics at the graduation ceremony for the NYPD's 1,171 new officers. 'Twelve years ago, no one thought New York's crime rate could go any lower. But it did: since 2001, crime has gone down by 32 percent and in a city of 8.4 million people, there have been fewer than 350 homicides and that is largely due to the work of the fine men and women you are about to join.' Legacy: Outgoing New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, center, sits as the crowd gives him a standing ovation during the graduation ceremony of new New York Police Department officers at Madison Square Garden in New York, December 27, 2013 . He also credited the city's controversial stop-and-frisk program for the murder rate's sharp decline, even though such encounters actually decreased by 60 per cent in 2013. In 2012, New York recorded 419 murders, a record low at that point, which translates to 5.05 slayings per 100,000. The Bronx has the highest rate of murders and in 2012 the borough recorded 114 murders or 8.10 per 100,000. Chicago was America's murder capital last year, recording a total of 500 by this time, or 18.46 per 100,000. However, Chicago also recorded its lowest murder rate since the 1960s in 2013, with only 418 recorded so far. Slipped through the cracks: Tanya Byrd, 45, pictured left with her six-year-old Down's syndrome son, was tragically murdered in her Bronx home in February by her elder son, police say . Detectives: The mother's body was chopped up and scattered around the Bronx neighborhood. Police say far fewer murders were carried out this year in New York . Baltimore and Detroit were the most deadly per person, with 218 murders and 34.85 per 100,000 in the Maryland capital and 386 murders or 54.59 per 100,000 in the Michigan city. Reliable homicide data began being kept in 1963, according to the NYPD. And homicides that year stood at 548. By the height of the crack epidemic in 1990, murders peaked at 2,245. While murders and shootings are on the decline, some crimes are on the rise again. Rape and robberies are down 5 per cent, but serious assault and non-violent thefts have increased 3 and 5 per cent respectively in 2013, the New York Times reports. This is largely due to the rise of smartphone theft. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, the murder rate in Newark is at its highest level for two decades. Some 110 people were slayed in 2013 in the city - the highest number since 1990. Mayor Luis Quintana Monday evening issued a statement saying that the city was fast-tracking the process to get more police officers on the streets and also to team up with other law enforcement agencies. 'Our entire city is mourning the loss of life due to gun violence which has negatively impacted our city during this holiday season,' Quintana said. 'We are listening to and agree with the concerns of our communities.

It means that when the recipients of the cards head to the register intending to use them, they will apparently have no value. Oops: Target workers scanned the wrong bar code on gift cards so their values were not activated . A Target spokesperson told MailOnline that the number of cards affected was less that one per cent of those sold over the holiday period, while KMSP put the number at 40,000. 'We are aware that some Target gift cards were not fully activated and apologize for the inconvenience,' a spokesperson said, adding that the impacted cards will be honored. If a customer thinks their card has not been activated, they should take it to the guest service desk at their local Target store or call 1-800-544-2943 for assistance. However, it may be a struggle to get through on the phone line as the store is experiencing a high volume of calls, KMSP reported.

Trouble ahead: It means that shoppers are unable to pay with the gift cards at the register . Affected? Target encourages shoppers to seek help in-store or call the number on the back of the card . 'They basically told me that the gift card that I received was useless without the receipt,' she said. 'I know that cashiers are busy especially during the holiday season but they need to make sure that when someone purchases a gift card that they make sure that they fully activate it. 'They don't know if it is being donated to a needy family who was hoping to use it to buy necessities such as milk and eggs and who has no way of knowing who donated the gift card to obtain the purchase receipt.' The spokesperson disputed that shoppers need the gift receipt to receive the proper value and that all stores have received clear instructions on how to treat the issue.","Target failed to scan the correct barcode on thousands of gift cards .
