A cruel internet hoaxer has hacked into a missing teen’s Twitter account and posted a message – giving her frantic friends and family false hope. A desperate search for Sierra LaMar has been underway since the 15-year-old was reported missing by her mother on March 16, with fears mounting she may have been kidnapped. But on Wednesday they saw a tweet had been posted on the from  the teen’s account, who has not been since failing to turn up to her bus stop or high school in Morgan Hill, California, more than a month ago. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Sierra disappeared on the walk to her school's bus stop March 16 in Morgan Hill, California . Hope: Sierra LaMar's twitter account had not been updated since she went missing, until a post appeared on Wednesday - giving friends and family false hope she was trying to make contact . The cryptic message, which read ‘By the way, we do punch’ followed by an expletive, was quickly deleted, according to Mercury News. But not before it spark speculation from some of the more than 4,500 people who follow her at twitter.com/cccairuh. Some hoped that Sierra, who is presumed kidnapped, may have been found or trying to make contact with her concerned relatives. Santa Clara County Sheriff's investigators soon dismissed that and confirmed it was a hoax. Authorities suspect whoever hacked the account, which is still open for public view, may have known her password. Last week the search continued underwater after sonar images revealed suspicious-looking objects in a local reservoir. Sierra's . cellphone was found near the side of the road the day after she . vanished and her Juicy brand black and pink purse with clothes folded . neatly inside was found the day after that. Reward: Marlene LaMar, the mother of missing teenager Sierra LaMar, appealed for her safe return as the family offered a $10,000 reward for information that may help find her . Donations: Sierra's family has scraped the $10,000 reward money together through fundraising and donations, the teen's father Steve said . Website: The 15-year-old's father Steve, mother Marlene and sister Danielle have also set up a website dedicated to finding the cheerleader . Investigators from the Santa Clara . Sheriff's Office used sonar technology at the Chesbro reservoir and . found five areas of concern, according to KTVU-TV. 'Based on the size and shape and . shadowing that we're seeing from the side scan sonar, we'd just like to . go back and take a second look at them,' Santa Clara County sheriff's Lt. Dan Rodriguez told the channel. 'They are larger than normal objects.' Because of the murky and dangerous conditions, and two feet of visibility, divers had to be strapped to police on land by rope. Divers, who went as deep as 60-feet, were also searching the nearby Uvas Reservoir in Santa Clara County today. So . far detectives have uncovered a golf ball and a flipper but there has . been no sign of Sierra, although her family is refusing to give up hope. The parents of the missing teen are offering a $10,000 reward for information that may help find her. Disturbing: Divers from the Santa Clara Sheriff's Office began searching the Chesbro Reservoir Thursday after sonar pictures detected areas of concern . Difficult: Peter Robinson, a diver with the sheriff's department, described the search conditions as dark with about two feet of visibility . The 15-year-old's mother Marlene, father . Steve and sister Danielle have also set up a website dedicated to . finding the cheerleader. Mrs LaMar told ABC7 news that her daughter's disappearance was weighing heavily on her. 'As each day goes on it's agonising,' she said. 'I'm definitely suffering sleep deprivation but I need to focus on the belief that Sierra is going to come forward.' Police believe Sierra has been . kidnapped as she does not have a history of running away and no family . problems. Interviews with friends and a search . of her computer also yielded no information indicating she had fled. Her disappearance has sparked an outpouring of support from the local community and received nation-wide press coverage. Thousands of Bay Area residents have joined the search for the teen in Morgan Hill and the surrounding area. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Alex Smith has also joined the search. Speaking . at a press conference over Easter weekend, Mr LaMar, a computer . engineer at a . tech startup in Sunnyvale, expressed his gratitude at the overwhelming . support the family had received from local residents. 'Everyone's been . so generous,' he said. Yesterday . the family launched the Help Us Find Sierra LaMar website, which . describes Sierra as a 'confident teenager who stands up for not only . herself but others as well'. It also hosts a gallery of pictures and allows friends . to post messages to Sierra. 'The world has seemed so out of . balance since you’ve been gone,' wrote Jenna Wondka. 'I’m missing you . more and more every day, you never leave my mind. You’re too young and . innocent for this to be happening. You’ve always been there for me and . I’ll always be here for you until you’re found and anytime after that.' The family is also accepting donations via the site. They have raised the $10,000 reward money through fundraising and donations, Mr LaMar said. 'We're hoping it might give someone the . motivation to come forward,' he said. 'We're desperate for anything that . can bring her home to us.' Poignant: Posters have been taped up near to where Sierra went missing, as her family hope for more clues . Search: Thousands of Bay Area residents have joined the search for the teen in Morgan Hill and the surrounding area . Potential clue: The handcuff box and condoms were found, near the teenager's home, pictured, and close to where her phone and handbag were found abandoned as shown on the map . So far the search has turned up an . empty 'handcuff' box and two used condoms, found by a search volunteer . within 1.5miles of where the pretty teen's phone and purse were found, days after she disappeared. Investigators told Mercury News that the find could be a major breakthrough in the disappearance which has stumped police, or it could be a simple coincidence. Authorities . have investigated more than 1,200 tip and clocked around 7,500 hours on . the case. They said they would be broadening the search this week. 'The sheriff’s office will be . sending out deputies on motor dirt bikes later this week to canvass . remote/rural areas in south Santa Clara County areas,' Sgt Jose . Cardoza, a spokesman for the Santa Clara County Office of the Sheriff, told the Huffington Post. If Sierra has been killed, her body is likely to be above ground, Sgt Cardoza said. 'Someone like that is not . going to dig a grave,' he said. 'He drove her out someplace and the body . will likely be in a ditch or (easily accessible) location.' He added her abductor could be a serial rapist or perhaps even a serial killer and a person likely familiar with the local area. School: Last week, sheriffs investigators visited Miss Lamar's school of Sobrato High, suspending their ground search for interviews with her classmates and friends . Without a trace: While police dogs lost her scent at her mother's driveway Sierra's cell phone was recovered in a field nearby the day after her disappearance .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . UPDATED: . 17:04 EST, 15 August 2011 . The ex-wife of a man accused of killing an Ohio schoolgirl in 1967 told a court she found the 14-year-old naked and suspended by ropes in their basement before she was killed. Robert Bowman, now 75, is charged with the murder of Eileen Adams, who vanished on her way home from Central Catholic High School in Toldeo. She was discovered six weeks later in a frozen field with her body hogtied and a nail driven into the back of her head, similar to several dolls that were collected when officers travelled to Miami to question Bowman. Cold-case killer: Robert Bowman, now 75, is on trial for murdering 14-year-old Eileen Adams in 1967 . There were signs she was sexually assaulted and strangled. Her body was tied with telephone and drapery cords. Investigators think Bowman kidnapped Miss Adams, held her captive in his basement for as long as two weeks and then killed her. Detectives first tried to link him to the slaying in the early 1980s, but they did not have enough evidence to bring charges until a cold-case squad reopened the investigation five years ago. New DNA evidence connected Bowman to the killing and police charged him even though they had no idea where he was living or even if he was still alive. Confrontation: Bowman was questioned by Ed Miller from America's Most Wanted before the trial . Schoolgirl: Miss Adams never returned home from Central Catholic High School, Toledo, on that cold December day in 1968 . He was profiled on 'America's Most Wanted' and police in California arrested him in 2008 near Palm Springs after he was spotted riding a bicycle. His attorney said he had been living in the desert under a tarp. On Monday Margaret Bowman, one of the key witnesses against her ex-husband, offered a chilling account of discovering the girl after hearing what she thought were rats in the cellar. She told jurors she opened a wooden door and was stunned to find a naked young girl tied-up and 'hanging like Jesus'. Her arms were outstretched and she had tape covering her mouth. Ms Bowman said she knew the girl was alive because: 'I looked in her eyes.' 'I was horrified, I was screaming, I was shaking,' she added. 'I didn't know what to think.' Eerie: Dolls tied up in a similar manner to how Miss Adams was found were discovered in Bowman's house in Miami . Mugshot: This is a police photo of Bowman from 1962 - five years before the killing . She said she ran upstairs and that her husband confronted her, saying that she was getting into his business and that he now had to kill the girl. He also threatened to kill his wife and their newborn daughter if she told anyone, she said. Ms Bowman said she never went in the basement again. 'That was enough,' she said. That same night, she testified, Bowman made her go with him as he dumped the body just north of Toledo, across the state line in Michigan. Miss Adams was discovered in a southern Monroe County field in February 1968. Ms Bowman said that at some point she discovered school books on a table in the kitchen. She opened one of the books and saw the name Eileen Adams written inside. The couple moved several times, including to Las Vegas, Phoenix and Miami. Ms Bowman said she didn't go to police until 1981, after she had saved enough money to leave her husband and return to Toledo. That was the first time anyone connected Bowman to the killing. During the trial's opening statements, defence attorney Peter Rost questioned why Miss Bowman had not told police years ago. 'You'll have to decide how believable she is,' he said. Detectives tracked Bowman down to Miami, Florida in 1982. Once a successful businessman who sold high-end handbags in Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue stores, he was living in an abandoned restaurant near Miami, wearing a tattered shirt, jeans and a scruffy beard. Bowman's attorney said he had become involved in an offbeat religion and given up all of his material things. Three more decades passed until cold-case detectives took DNA samples from Bowman's ex-wife and their daughter and compared them with DNA found on Adams' clothing. Sister: Mary Ann Brimmer, Miss Adams' older sister, testified on the first day of the trial . Gruesome: Miss Adams was found hogtied with telephone cables and with a nail driven in her head . Retired Monroe County Sheriff Detective Peter Navarre took the stand at Lucas County Common Pleas Court on Friday to testify that when officers questioned Bowman in Miami, he said: 'What if I told you I probably killed that girl?' Detective Navarre added that the way Miss Adams was tied was similar to several dolls that were collected from the abandoned building housing Bowman. One was hanging from the ceiling with twine tied around its ankles and another had a nail driven in the back of its head, assistant Lucas County Prosecutor Chris Anderson said. Also during the trial on Friday, the victim's friend testified saying she remembers Eileen riding the bus with her everyday to and from school, including the day she disappeared. On the first day of the trial on Thursday, Mary Ann Brimmer told the court how her little sister failed to come home for the 'first time' on the day of her disappearance. More than four decades after she waited at the front door of her West Toledo home Mrs Brimmer, who still lives in the area, testified: 'I just kept standing at the door, waiting for her. It got to be 6 or 6.30. She'd never done anything like that. Ever.' Bowman has pleaded not guilty and faces life in prison if he's convicted.","Margaret Bowman kept quiet after being threatened .

A mom charged with killing her daughter in a brutal scissor attack has pleaded not guilty on grounds of insanity. Danielle Yvonne Slaughter, 27, claims she heard the 6-year-old speak and laugh in what she later told police was an 'evil voice'. Slaughter spoke clearly while answering the judge's questions and entering her plea during a brief arraignment in Clark County District Court on Thursday. Evil: Police say that Danielle Yvonne Slaughter killed her 6-year-old daughter with scissors, because she used 'evil words' Judge Melisa De La Garza ordered Slaughter to appear for trial on May 16. She was refused bail and faces life in prison if convicted. Slaughter was found by police running naked and covered in blood through Las Vegas on March 11, according to court documents. Drugged: Slaughter had been taking diet pills and was unable to sleep . She told officers the blood on her hands was the ‘lamb of God’ and asked 'Did I kill my daughter?' Is she dead?’ Police went to Slaughter’s house, where her six-year-old daughter, Kayla Franks, was found dead. The . mom told police she had been having trouble sleeping since she began . taking slimming pill Hydroxycut four days earlier, a drug which was . temporarily withdrawn from the market in 2009 over liver damage fears. She said she had felt an evil presence in her home for several days, adding that it was not something she had experienced before. In a police interview she told how she and her daughter were sitting on the bed when the girl spoke in 'evil words', laughed 'in an evil voice' and clawed and kicked at her. Slaughter said she picked up scissors and struck the child several times. She added that she had slept for just one hour the previous night. Homicide Lt. Ray Steiber said: ‘There was no rhyme or reason to it. I don't think there's anything that anyone could have anticipated.’ Jailed: Police found Slaughter running naked and bloodied in Las Vegas. She was held at the Clark County jail (pictured) pending an initial court appearance. He added police believe that Slaughter was sleep-deprived and may have been affected by the diet pills she had been taking. Her . lawyer, deputy Clark County Public Defender Andrea Luem, said she isn't . contesting Slaughter's competency for trial. Instead, Slaughter is . claiming temporary insanity. Ms Luem said on Thursday it was too early to tell if lack of sleep and taking the dietary supplement had any effect on the killing.","Danielle Slaughter refused bail and faces trial on May 16 .

Panamanian investigators and FBI agents searched a hostel in Panama Friday for blood traces or other signs of a California woman last seen there several months ago, an official said. Searches on land and by divers off the coast have turned up no sign of Yvonne Baldelli, 42, of Laguna Niguel, California, whose family reported her missing in January. Panamanian police investigator Alexis Munoz said that his officers, FBI agents and forensic specialists were using a chemical that could reveal signs of blood on the walls and floor of the hostel El Sapo, in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, a popular tourist spot where Ms Baldelli was last seen on November 26. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lovers in paradise: Ms Baldelli moved to Panama with Mr Brimager who used to be a Marine . New beginnings: Ms Baldelli moved to Panama in an effort to 'start over' after a recent divorce and losing her job at Procter and Gamble in California . She was seen with an American . boyfriend, who left for Costa Rica days later and has since returned to . the U.S., according to Munoz. Authorities said they were looking for signs that Ms Baldelli may have been a victim of violence in the hotel. Ms Baldelli and her partner stayed at . the two-story hostel for about two months. Munoz said Ms Baldelli's family . had lost any contact with her at the end of November, 'which makes us . think that there may have been some crime against her.' The pair rented an apartment together on the Panamanian island of Carenero and Mr Brimager, a former marine, played guitar in local bars. Ms Baldelli's parents last heard from her by email in the end of November, but then nothing since. Mr Brimager said that she had run away to Costa Rica and taken up with another man, but her passport records do not register any travel to the neighboring country. Her family became concerned when Mr Brimager stopped answering their calls and returned to California in December, shortly after her disappearance. Unresponsive: Ms Baldelli's parents last heard from her in November and became concerned when her boyfriend said she ran off to Costa Rica with another man . Together: Yvonne Baldelli set up house with her boyfriend at the time, Brian Brimager, shortly after she had been fired from her job at Procter and Gamble in California and going through a divorce . Her sister Michelle Valenzuela said that she sensed that something bad was going to happen when she sister headed off to Panama, telling CBS that she had an 'ominous' feeling. Aside from her senses, the first tangible clue they had was when the weekly emails stopped coming. Fox News Latino cites police sources that say the couple had a violent relationship during their time in Panama and have suggested that the possibility of a crime of passion has not been ruled out. Another unusual move by Mr Brimager was to become engaged and marry another woman in the months immediately following his girlfriend's disappearance. Making music: While in Panama, Mr Brimager played guitar in local bars . New beginning? Mr Brimager married a different woman in California, seen here, just months after Yvonne disappeared . Mr Brimager has since taken down his Facebook page, and neither he nor his new wife are responding to press calls. Since the declaration of him as a formal 'person of interest', the FBI announced that much of their investigation will take place in the U.S. That said, they will also be sending divers down to Panama to search the area around the home where Ms Baldelli and Mr Brimager lived. Some of her relatives flew to Panama to look for her in January after she did not respond to emails about a planned family reunion. Hunt: Her family suggested that searchers look for her Tiffany 'Circle Lariat' necklace that she always wore . Possible scene: This is the home where Ms Baldelli and Mr Brimager lived while in Panama. The FBI said that they would be sending divers to search the area around their home . Local investigations have turned up no solid clues about Ms Baldelli's whereabouts, or the location of her dog named Georgia May. Her family launched an effort to enlist local volunteers to search via Facebook, and the FBI has since become involved in the case. FBI investigators are also officially looking into Mr Brimager and his connection to the case. 'What we want is to bring Yvonne home and show that she's loved and cared about,' her father James Faust said.

Lies: Janine Wiles, 24 from Blackpool, Lancashire, has been jailed for six months, at Preston Crown Court, for falsely reporting her daughter had been abducted from her backyard . A pregnant mother-of-four has been . jailed for six months for falsely claiming her two-year-old daughter had . been snatched from her back yard. Janine Wiles told police the girl was seized while she was playing on a trampoline. She claimed she saw a masked man walking off with her daughter, ran after him and managed to seize the child out of his arms. Police launched a 13-day hunt involving 50 officers and costing more than £50,000, which culminated in the arrest of two men. Wiles, 24, even took part in an . identity parade – where she made a false identification – before she . eventually admitted she had been lying. Yesterday she was beginning a six . month sentence after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice . at Preston Crown Court. The court heard unemployed Wiles . called police in June last year to say an intruder had scaled the wall . of her back yard and attempted to snatch her daughter. Francis McEntee, prosecuting, said: . ‘She described a confrontation with the man, grabs the child from him . and the man walks away from the scene.’ Police were called to the house in . Blackpool and began screening CCTV footage. Case: Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard that she had made up that her two-year-old was snatched by a man who tried to escape on a bike . Wiles' deception is similar to the one carried out by Karen Matthews, above, in 2008. Matthews, . 36, was nicknamed ‘Britain’s worst mother’ after she hatched a plot to . abduct her daughter Shannon, below right, then aged nine, in February 2008 in an elaborate attempt . to claim a £50,000 reward. She was released from prison this month after serving just half of an eight-year sentence for kidnapping her daughter. The . mother of seven was freed from Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire and . taken to a secret location believed to be within 30 miles of her former . home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire. Matthews and her accomplice, Michael Donovan, 44, sparked a £3.2million police hunt when they kidnapped Shannon from her home. A . tearful Matthews made TV appeals pleading with her daughter’s abductor . to set her free and hundreds of local people helped search for the girl. Shannon . was found by police 24 days later in Donovan’s flat a mile away, hidden . in a compartment under a bed. Donovan, who was also jailed for eight . years, was released last week. Wiles went on to give a . detailed description of the man and an ‘emotive account’ of her child . screaming ‘mummy, mummy’, with another child – who was playing in the . backyard – shouting out: ‘Janine, he’s got her.’ Mr McEntee said police wasted hours . reviewing CCTV footage and spent £4,847 on collecting forensic evidence . and more than £45,000 on manpower during the ‘wild goose chase’. ‘There were repeated concerns from . those living in the neighbourhood, who were all in fear this offender . may strike again,’ he added. ‘And the police were not in a position to allay these fears as they were chasing a phantom offender.’ Virginia Hayton, defending, said Wiles . – who is pregnant with her fifth child – was depressed after breaking . up with her partner. She said the cry for help had . ironically provided the support she needed, as her boyfriend moved back . in. Miss Hayton said: ‘This was not premeditated. She found herself . getting swept away.’ Sentencing Wiles to six months in . prison, Judge Pamela Badley said: ‘The effect of your actions, first of . all, was public disquiet in a community. 'One of the most dreadful things is . the fear of the lack of safety of a child. 'That causes concern to every . parent, every school, every responsible adult.’ Judge Badley sympathised with Wiles’ tough life but added it was her public duty to jail Wiles, who wept . uncontrollably at the sentence. The defendant was told it was ‘highly likely’ she would be free when due to give birth in September. Detective Chief Inspector Andrea . Barrow said: ‘This had a massive impact on residents who were obviously . concerned there was a man who had tried to abduct a child when in fact . this simply was not true. ‘Parents changed their activities because of their concerns for their own children.’","Depressed Janine Wiles claimed daughter was snatched from her garden .

"U.S. companies having to manage with small, expensive supply, while Chinese companies have greater access . By . Rachel Rickard Straus . PUBLISHED: . 11:04 EST, 13 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:51 EST, 13 March 2012 . The United States, European Union and Japan all filed complaints today with the World Trade Organization, claiming that China is stockpiling rare earth metals vital to the production of technology components. China has a stranglehold on the global supply of 17 rare earth materials essential for making high-end goods such as hybrid cars, camera lenses, mobile phones and weapons. However, it has cut its export quotas in recent years, which critics say gives Chinese companies an unfair competitive advantage. Stranglehold: Chinese companies have access to a large supply of the rare earth materials essential for making mobile phones (pictured) and other high-end goods . U.S. companies are having to manage with a small, expensive supply, while Chinese companies have access to more of these essential materials at a cheaper price, according to senior U.S. administration officials. It is thought China has cut its export quotas to cope with growing demand at home, although the Chinese government also says environmental concerns are behind the restrictions. U.S. industry officials claim the restriction is an unfair trade practice and forbidden by WTO rules, a group that includes China as a member. President Barack Obama planned to announce that the U.S. was filing a complaint from the White House today. The fresh action is part of President Obama's broader effort to crack down on what his administration sees as unfair trading practices by China. The U.S., European Union and Japan filed separate but coordinated complaints, which will trigger a dispute settlement consultation. Dispute: The U.S., European Union and Japan have all complained to the WTO (headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland pictured) If no resolution can be found within 60 days, the dispute may be put to a WTO panel for a ruling. Depending on the outcome, sanctions against China are possible at the end of the process. The complaints also cover tungsten, a very hard metal, and molybdenum, a metallic element used to make different types of steel. Anticipating the complaints, China defended its curbs on rare earths production earlier today, calling it an environmental measure. China needs to limit environmental damage and conserve scarce resources, said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Liu Weimin. ‘We think the policy is in line with WTO rules,’ Liu said at a briefing. Global manufacturers that depend on Chinese supplies were alarmed by Beijing's decision in 2009 to limit exports while it built up an industry to produce lightweight magnets and other goods that use them. China has about 30 per cent of rare earths deposits but accounts for 97 per cent of the world's production. The complaints filed today follow an earlier EU challenge to China at the WTO on restrictions on other raw materials. Earlier this year, the WTO ruled that export restrictions on those other materials were incompatible with the rules of the global trade organization. But EU officials said China has made no move to comply with the earlier ruling. EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said China's export quotas and export duties give Chinese companies an unfair competitive advantage, and must be removed. ‘These measures hurt our producers and consumers in the EU and across the world,’ De Gucht said.","U.S. companies having to manage with small, expensive supply, while Chinese companies have greater access ."

It comes more than 160 years after gold was discovered in the Golden State by a carpenter and everyone was soon piling into the industry.

"By . Rose Parker and Ted Thornhill . UPDATED: . 09:14 EST, 2 September 2011 . Thin-haired with a large nose and deep-set eyes, it is the unremarkable face of a man who may be the most notorious murderer in history. Astonishingly, it is also the first time anyone has attempted to put together an e-fit of Carl Feigenbaum, one of the men most likely to be Jack the Ripper. The 54-year-old German merchant seaman went to the electric chair in New York in 1894 after the brutal murder of his landlady Juliana Hoffman. E-fit: Carl Feigenbaum was a German sailor who expert Trevor Marriott believes was Jack the Ripper . SIR JOHN WILLIAMSHe was an obstetrician, someone who specialises in pregnancy and women’s reproductive tracts, and treated Queen Victoria’s daughter Princess Beatrice. One of his descendants, Tony Williams, put him forward as the Ripper in 2005 book Uncle Jack, which he co-wrote with Humphrey Price. Their argument is that he killed the women as part of his research into infertility. ROBERT MANNHistorian Mei Trow points the finger at mortuary attendant Robert Mann. He was well educated in anatomy, lived locally and came from a poor background. The first two victims, Polly Nichols and Annie Chapman, are known to have been delivered to his mortuary. PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR . He killed the women after being driven insane by syphilis, according to an article in The Criminologist in 1970 by Dr Thomas E A Stowell. MONTAGUE JOHN DRUITTDruitt was a barrister who came under suspicion because he committed suicide just after the final murder. However, he lived in Kent – and most Ripper experts believe the suspect was local to Whitechapel. DR THOMAS NEILL CREAMCream, a doctor specialising in abortions, was hanged in 1892 for several murders he committed in London and his last words were reportedly ‘I am Jack…’. A psychopath with a self-confessed penchant for mutilating women, even his own lawyer believed he was the Ripper. Now, to mark the 123rd anniversary of the first murder, Ripper expert Trevor Marriott has composed his portrait from a detailed description made when he was admitted to prison. And if the former murder squad detective is correct, it may finally put a face to this most elusive of murderers. Mr Marriot put together the picture for a BBC documentary which airs tonight and identifies Feigenbaum as the man most likely to be Jack. He comprehensively reviewed the five key murders of prostitutes Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly. He then got on the trail of his suspect after investigating groups of people who may have been in Whitechapel at the time of the killings, which took place between August and November 1888. These included sailors as the district - famed for its prostitutes and taverns - is just a short distance from London's docks. Mr Marriott began examining crew lists for ships that were in dock in the autumn of 1888. It was then he had a breakthrough. Feigenbaum, already among 200 names in the frame, had been aboard a boat called the Reiher, which had been in the East End in the critical period. For Mr Marriott, the puzzle began to piece itself together. Gaps in the killings indicated the perpetrator had been a traveller. Feigenbaum had admitted he was overcome by the desire to mutilate women. And then there was his lawyer's dramatic statement after his execution at Sing Sing jail. 'I believe that Carl Feigenbaum, whom you have just seen put to death in the electric chair, can easily be connected with the Jack the Ripper murders in Whitechapel, London,' William Lawton told reporters. 'I will stake my professional reputation that if the police will trace this man's movements carefully for the last few years their investigations will lead them to London and to Whitechapel.' He detailed a confession Feigenbaum made late one night. 'I have for years suffered from a singular disease, which induces an all absorbing passion,' the prisoner told him. 'This passion manifests itself in a desire to kill and mutilate every woman who falls in my way. 'At such times I am unable to control myself.' Brutal: Mary Ann Nicholls, left, had her throat cut while Annie Chapman, right, had her womb removed . Gruesome: Catherine Eddowes, left, had her stomach ripped open and . Elizabeth Stride, right, had an artery severed on the right-side of her . neck . Lawton believed his client had . intended to mutilate landlady Mrs Hoffman, 56. But she screamed so much . as he cut her throat that, fearing he would be caught, he fled. Police quickly captured him. He was put to death on April 27 1896 but the execution was not without drama. Officials gave him three huge bolts of . electricity, administering the final burst as they did not believe he . was alive - but neither were they convinced that he was dead. There are many, however, who doubt that Feigenbaum was actually Jack the Ripper. Little is known about his life beyond the thinnest of details and prosecutor Vernon M.S. Davis described him as a 'cunning fellow, surrounded by a great deal of mystery'. Grisly: A drawing of Feigenbaum being electrocuted, left, and right, a 19th century version of the wanted poster depicting the Ripper attacking one of his victims . The most concrete information is his physical description, catalogued so carefully on the Sing Sing remand form. He had  grey eyes, dark brown hair and . a 'medium sized head' with a hat size of 6 7/8 or 7, stood  5ft4½ tall . and weighed 126lbs. The prison official noted he had thin hair on the top of his head and a slim neck. 'Eyes small and deep-set,' he noted. 'Eyebrows curved. Forehead high and heavily arched. 'Nose large, red and has raw pimples. Teeth poor and nearly all gone on left sides. 'Anchor in india ink on right hand at base of thumb and first finger. 'Round scar or birthmark on right leg below left knee.' Feigenbaum appears to have had a number of aliases, living as an itinerant seaman across Europe and America. And it is his relatively humble profession that make many believe he could not possibly been the Ripper. It . has usually been presumed that the surgical precision of the . mutilations indicated a killer with intimate knowledge of the human . anatomy. However, Mr Marriot . argues that the removal of the women's organs may actually have taken . place in at the mortuary, the body parts reserved for medical training.","German merchant seaman, 54, had penchant for mutilating women ."

Pain: Peter Mantell, a retired aircraft fitter, said nurses told him he would be kept in overnight for observation . An elderly patient was sent home from hospital in the middle of the night - in a taxi wearing a flimsy gown and slippers. Peter Mantell, 73, described the experience as the most ‘degrading’ of his life. He went to the A&E department at Stepping Hill in Stockport at around 11.30pm after developing complications following a knee-replacement operation and was given a bed. Mr Mantell, a retired aircraft fitter, and his partner Sylvia Smith, 63, say nurses told them he would be kept in overnight for observation. Ms Smith went home with his clothes and promised to return the next day to collect him. But just hours later - at around 3.30am - Mr Mantell was approached by staff who said he had been checked over and was now able to go home. He said he pleaded with medics to allow him to remain on a ward - because he had no clothes, nobody to pick him up and was on crutches. But his pleas were ignored and he was instead told to go home in his hospital gown - and staff would call a taxi to transport him. Scene: Mr Mantell went to the A&E department at Stepping Hill in Stockport at around 11.30pm after developing complications following a knee-replacement operation and was given a bed . He arrived back at his Reddish home at around 4.30am - but ended up being readmitted three days later with the same complaint. Mr Mantell said: 'I was disgusted with the way I was treated - it was like a cattle run. 'I was wearing a thin hospital gown - one of those that you tie at the back - and my slippers. I was also on crutches. It stunned me that they thought it was fine to discharge me like that and when they told me they’d call for a taxi, I was speechless. 'I was still in a lot of pain and I felt they just wanted to get rid of me, like I was too much trouble. I never expected to be chucked out, especially not in the middle of the night. I was just told to wait for the taxi in the waiting room. At one point it all got a bit much and I was breaking down - it was so distressing.' Degrading: Mr Mantell arrived back at his Reddish home at around 4.30am - but ended up being readmitted three days later with the same complaint . Mr Mantell had been originally admitted to Stepping Hill on March 8 for a knee replacement operation. He had the surgery the next day but then developed an infection in his leg and a blood clot on his lung. He was allowed home for the first time on March 22 at 2pm but he was rushed back in the next day at 11.30pm after he continued to feel unwell. Ms Smith, a retired cafe owner, said: 'When we got to A&E they said they needed to monitor him overnight so I went home. But they gave him medication and sent him home in the early hours. I couldn’t believe it when he arrived back within hours of going in - I was stunned.' Ms Smith called the hospital again on March 27 to complain her partner was still in agony - but was told to call their GP as he was no longer their patient. Mr Mantell said: 'We called the GP and they said to dial 999 as it sounded serious. 'The infection in my leg was still there and it had to be drained. I ended up being in hospital for almost a week. Stepping Hill’s motto is ‘every patient matters’ - to me, that’s just a joke. I never want to go back there. I’m scared to be ill.' David Cameron this week called for patients to be treated with dignity and respect as hospitals were told to end the practice of discharging vulnerable people from wards during the night. Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, the Medical Director of the NHS, wrote to Strategic Health Authorities urging them to ‘urgently’ review their practices after it emerged hundreds of thousands of patients are sent home in the middle of the night. Freedom of Information requests revealed that, out of 100 NHS trusts, 239,233 patients had been sent home between 11pm and 6am last year. A spokesman for Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Stepping Hill, said: 'We will never discharge a patient unless it is safe to do so and they have appropriate arrangements at home. 'When people attend the A&E department they are assessed and then either given immediate treatment and return home or admitted as an inpatient. 'After Mr Mantell had been assessed and treated by our A&E staff, he did not require hospital admission. We therefore arranged for a taxi to take him direct to his home where we knew he would not be alone. We are very sorry for any distress caused to Mr Mantell and his family.' Stepping Hill remains at the centre of a police investigation into 22 suspected cases of insulin poisoning that is suspected to have led to seven deaths. Nurse Victorino Chua, 46, was arrested on suspicion of murdering three . patients and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to 18 others at . the hospital in January.

A top Houston public school has become embroiled in a child grooming scandal after 4th grade students became pen-pals with a convicted child molester. Parents of two children at Trinity Lutheran School filed a negligence lawsuit alleging that class teacher Laura Perry set her students up to write to Rickey Rae Rowlett, 55, who was convicted on March 22 for abusing a girl under 14. The suit alleges that the Pastor of Trinity Lutheran School and Church, Michael Dorn, knew of and approved of Perry's pen-pal plan. Frightening for parents: Fifty-five-year old Rickey Rowlett received letters for months from children despite being in jail for child sex offences . Furthermore, it is claimed that Rowlett, who is a friend of Perry's family was delivered the letters in jail by Perry's father hidden from prison staff in large gift packages. Another claim in the lawsuit is that Perry's husband Blake was in contact with his wife's students as a soccer coach, even though he is charged with possessing child pornography by Harris County in Texas. Letter writing lessons: One of the letters that Rowlett wrote to one of the children at Trinity Lutheran School in Houston . While Laura Perry no longer works at the school and the principal Ann Boatman is on administrative leave, questions are being asked as to who knew what and when. The lawsuit alleges that the pen-pal project was Laura Perry's idea and that she allegedly told students that Rowlett was falsely accused. Blake Perry (left) and Laura Perry (right) married last year and are both involved in the pen-pal scandal at Trinity Lutheran School in Houston . 'The children were told by Laura Perry that Rickey Rea Rowlett had kidnapped his grandchildren to keep them from harm by parents or others,' said the suit filed by the two unnamed parents. 'In reality, Rowlett had been accused of aggravated sexual assault.' The project which began before Rowlett's March 22 conviction saw children offer up personal information to him. To the top: Pastor Michael Dorn of Trinity Lutheran Church and School is accused of not acting fast enough to deal with convicted child molester Rowlett writing to nine and ten year old children . 'Laura Perry had her children, as a project to obtain a grade in the classroom, participate in an open writing campaign with Rowlett by which the children would give their personal information to Rowlett and Rowlett would respond with warm and encouraging letters to the children, allowing Rowlett to establish a rapport with the children and establishing them as potential future victims of his and others,' claimed the lawsuit heard in Houston. Before his conviction it is thought that Rowlett would have been in a position to share the children's information with other sex offenders. 'In the Comal County jail, all persons charged with child or sexual crimes were kept out of the general population, but were segregated together with contact and communications between them,' continued the parents complaint. 'The letters from these children, containing full names, ages and locations where the children could be found could, and upon information and belief were, distributed freely.' Authorities found the letters as they were transferring Rowlett from one cell to another in the county jail on the day of his conviction. Trinity Lutheran School is one of Houston's most sought after public schools . 'It's very alarming,' said Comal County District Attorney Jennifer Tharp who first alerted parents at the school to the issue. One mother of the dozen or so children who became pen-pals with Rowlett spoke to Fox News in Houston about her shock. 'I have two little boys who now are very aware of how horrible adults can be,' said the mother who did not wish to be named. 'He uses words like, 'Whatz up' with a z. Looking at it makes me sick . because I feel like it was conditioning all along to develop and endear . himself to these children.' The pen pal relationship which was established over a period of several months before being discovered is at the heart of the parents legal complaint. Principal Amy Boatman of Trinity Lutheran School has been placed on administrative leave . It is claimed that school pastor Michael Dorn had a lax attitude towards child protection as he had been aware that Perry's wife, Blake was accused of owning child porn and was working with the children. However, John Menke, chairman of the school's governing board, said that Blake Perry had not been near to the school since his indictment in Harris County. The Perry's family friendship with Rowlett went as far as Larry Lanfried, Laura Perry's father, acting as a character witness in his molestation trial in New Braunfels. Legal ramifications: Parents of two children who were pen-pals with Rowlett have filed a negligence lawsuit against Trinity Lutheran Church and School . 'Trinity has allowed, in fact encouraged ... minor children to have contact and communication with a child molester and a person indicted for promotion of child pornography,' said the suit filed by attorney Charles H. Peckham. 'Trinity has approved and condoned the release of identification of minor children's information for distribution with the jail and prison systems.' Countering the claims of negligence, Trinity Lutheran School was adamant it had done all it could have. 'We've hired a private investigator to find out exactly what happened and have enacted new security protocols and policies,' said John Menke Wednesday. 'There's a long history of churches corresponding with inmates. 'In this case, it was really poorly handled. We didn't have good information or know the type of charges pending.'

Police have ruled out allegations that the News of the World gave the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler ‘false hope’ by deleting her voicemails. A five-month investigation found that while staff at the now-defunct tabloid did intercept some of Milly’s messages, there was ‘no evidence’ to support claims that they then cynically erased them to make room for new ones to be left. A senior detective told the Leveson Inquiry yesterday that although there was still a question mark over two of Milly’s messages which had apparently been wiped several weeks after her disappearance, they may well have been deleted automatically. Anger: Bob Dowler and Sally Dowler, the parents of murdered Milly Dowler, give evidence at the Leveson inquiry last November. Mrs Dowler said she didn't sleep for three nights after being told that Milly's phone had been hacked . Detective Chief Inspector John MacDonald said the truth of exactly how they were erased will probably never be known. The incendiary allegation made in the . Guardian that journalists had deliberately deleted Milly’s voicemails . accelerated the closure of the News of the World, and was a significant . factor in prompting the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards. It was also followed by a £3million . compensation payment. News International, which ran the News of the . World, paid the Dowlers £2million with Rupert Murdoch personally . donating an additional £1million, which was split between six charities . of their choice. Milly, 13, vanished on March 21, 2002, while walking home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. In heart-breaking testimony to the . Leveson Inquiry last November, Sally Dowler recounted the night of March . 24, 2002, when she rang her daughter’s mobile phone and found fresh . space was available on its previously full voicemail account. She shouted to her husband: ‘She’s picked up her voicemail, Bob. She’s alive!’ Victim: The News of the World admitted hacking Milly Dowler's mobile phone but it remains unknown whether two missing messages were deleted deliberately or were removed from her message box automatically . The previously automated response had . suddenly reverted to Milly’s own greeting. The sound of her daughter’s . voice led Mrs Dowler to believe Milly had deleted some messages. But the Scotland Yard inquiry found . the deletions had been made automatically by the phone company, which at . that time automatically wiped all messages after 72 hours. Mr MacDonald said there is no evidence . anyone attempted to hack Milly’s mobile phone before March 26, 2002, . two days after Mrs Dowler made the call which gave her false hope. He said police cannot conclusively say . whether any of Milly’s voicemails were manually deleted after that . date, although two messages are missing. He added: ‘It is not known why that happened and it will not now be possible to provide an explanation.’ False hope: The Dowlers also criticised police for not prosecuting phone hacking in 2002, the year their daughter's mobile was accessed . Yesterday, after carrying out a . detailed analysis of call data and phone company procedures at the time, . Mr MacDonald effectively confirmed that it was ‘unlikely’ the News of . the World was behind the deletions. Milly’s body was discovered in . woodland in September 2002.

The corrections officer whose sordid double-life was revealed when Facebook suggested his first wife become friends with his second was today charged with bigamy. Alan O’Neill, who formerly called himself Alan Fulk, pleaded not guilty to the felony charge and was released on bail. His double-lifestyle was first exposed when Facebook suggested that Ellenora Fulk, O'Neill's first wife, be friends with Teri Wyatt-O'Neill, his second. Busted: When Ellenora Fulk saw this picture on Teri Wyatt-O'Neill's Facebook page, she realised that the stranger was married to her husband, Alan O'Neill . Though Ms Fulk did not recognise the woman in the picture, she identified the man across from her as her estranged husband Alan. When Ms Fulk confronted her husband, . Alan O'Neill, he admitted that he had married Ms O'Neill despite having . never divorced Ms Fulk. According to charging documents filed earlier this month, he married Ms Fulk in 2001, moved out in 2009, changed his name and remarried without divorcing her. Ms Fulk first noticed O'Neill had moved on to another woman when Facebook suggested the friendship connection to Ms O'Neill under the 'People You May Know' feature. 'Wife number 1 went to wife number 2's page and saw a picture of her and her husband with a wedding cake,' Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said. Ms Fulk then called the defendant's mother. 'An hour later the defendant arrived at [Ms Fulk's] apartment, and she asked him several times if they were divorced,' court records show. 'The defendant said, ""No, we are still married.""' Wives: O'Neill first married Ms Fulk, left, then Ms O'Neill, right, but never divorced his first wife . Neither O'Neill nor Ms Fulk had filed for divorce, according to charging documents. The name change came in December, and later that month he married Ms O'Neill. O'Neill allegedly asked Ms Fulk not to tell anybody about his dual marriages and promised he would fix it, the documents state. But she alerted authorities anyway. 'Facebook is now some place where people discover things about each other that end up reporting that to law enforcement,' Mr Lindquist said. Technology: It was a Facebook friend suggestion which first unravelled the alleged deception . O'Neill has worked as a Pierce County corrections officer for five years, sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said. He was placed on administrative leave after prosecutors charged him on Thursday. He could face up to a year in jail if convicted. O'Neill is free, but due in court later this month, which is standard procedure for non-violent crimes.

London’s iconic Trafalgar Square fountains will be switched off over the summer to comply with the strict hosepipe ban. Thames Water has ordered the supply be cut last night as part of a blanket restriction, which includes ornamental fountains, designed to conserve drought-hit reservoirs. The Greater London Authority said the current water stocks feeding the fountains will run out at the weekend. Negotiations are underway to see if a compromise can be found in time for the arrival of millions of tourists to Trafalgar Square during the Olympic and Jubilee summer. Still waters: The famous fountains in Trafalgar Square have been turned off as part of a hosepipe ban imposed across Southern England as a result of low rainfall this winter . All quiet: Drops of water trickle from the spout a fountain at one of London's top tourist spots . Run dry: The National Gallery stands behind the eerily still pool where Thames Water has decided to cut water supplies to help drought-hit reservoirs . Something missing: Nelson's Column looms over an unusually quiet Trafalgar Square . Bans on hosepipes for 20million people . in the drought-hit South and East of the country came into force . yesterday, ahead of a drizzly weekend for the North and West, but more . sunshine in the South. Water firms say the ban is likely to last until the autumn if not into next year, even if there is normal rainfall during the summer. This March saw just 37 per cent of the long-term average rainfall in all of England and Wales, according to the Met Office – just a little above last year which was the driest March on record whilst  February saw just 46 per cent of the average. An Anglian Water spokesman said: ‘It’s not beyond the realms of possibility it will carry on into next year. ‘Even if it is a rainy summer, a lot of the rainfall is absorbed by plants and it does not help boost our  supplies after two dry winters have left our reservoirs and aquifers very low. ‘We have to be realistic and responsible, and will lift them as soon as we are able.’ Southern Water said the ban was likely to last the whole summer and could carry on into next year, unless there were weeks of continuous heavy downpours. Richard Aylard of Thames Water said: ‘Realistically it will be in through the summer into the autumn, as summer rain doesn’t do much. Unless we have a particularly wet summer.’ In the summer of 2005, a hosepipe ban . imposed on 12million people mainly in the South East was not lifted by . all suppliers until the following January after a rainy  festive season. Running dry: Tourists may not be able to cool off this summer in London's Trafalgar Square fountains after the water supply was turned off under the hosepipe ban . Disappointment: The fountains had undergone a £200,000 pre-Olympic makeover ahead of the 2012 Games which is expected to bring millions of tourists into the capital . Dry: The River Kennet in the village of Lockeridge, near Marlborough, is just one of many waterways with record low levels as England faces a strict hosepipe ban to combat the drought . Anglian Water last imposed a hosepipe ban in the summer of 1990 – it lasted 15 months. Seven water companies have banned the . use of hosepipes and sprinklers to water the garden, wash vehicles or . boats, clean patios or any other surfaces or for recreational purposes. Watering cans still be used, and there are exemptions for blue badge holders and cleaning for safety reasons. But the Environment Agency warned hosepipe bans were ‘not a silver bullet’, and urged business to clamp down on washing cars and windows to save water. Groundwater levels are lower than during the drought of 1976 in parts of Shropshire, the Chilterns and the North Downs, and reservoirs are extremely low. Public fountains – including London’s Trafalgar Square, which was set to be a centrepiece of the Olympics after a £200,000 refit – will be turned off this weekend when their current supplies run out. While there have been two years of chronic low rainfall, enough water for 20million people is leaked by water companies every day. Yesterday the Daily Mail revealed bosses of water companies which are imposing hosepipe bans took home £4million in bonuses in the last financial year (2010-11), including those who failed to meet leakage targets. They even handed a £500million windfall to mainly foreign shareholders in September 2011 after the drought was declared. Water bills rose by up to 8 per cent at the start of this month, squeezing living standards in households even further. The average rise was 5.7 per cent to an average of £376, which is just above inflation. But Southern Water, which has one million customers, hiked bills by 8.2 per cent and Thames Water, which has nearly 9million customers, by 6.7 per cent. Conservation groups have welcomed the ban. Phil Burston of the RSPB said: ‘Reducing demand now will help keep more water in the environment, keeping rivers flowing for longer and protecting their precious wildlife.’","The iconic Grade II-listed London landmark uses half a million litres of water .

David Cameron and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt were yesterday granted the right to see key Leveson Inquiry documents in advance. They will be able to inspect any relevant text messages or emails which have been submitted to the inquiry by other witnesses before giving evidence themselves. The ruling by Lord Justice Leveson at an emergency hearing came ahead of potentially explosive testimony next  week from former News International executives Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson,  the Prime Minister’s former spin doctor. Danger: The Government wants to see the evidence of Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson as soon as possible . In total eight Cabinet ministers were . named as ‘core participants’ in the inquiry. These are people who have a . significant interest in the hearings or may face criticism. The others are: Deputy Prime Minister . Nick Clegg, Business Secretary Vince Cable, Education Secretary Michael . Gove, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke, Home Secretary Theresa May and . Chancellor George Osborne. The ministers will have the same . rights as the dozens of existing core participants for this section of . the inquiry, which is looking at relations between the press and . politicians. They include hacking victims, Mrs Brooks, national newspapers and a number of current and former MPs. Lord Justice Leveson said the . Government’s application was ‘somewhat unusual in form’, as ministers . were not currently seeking to cross-examine witnesses but were applying . for advance sight of witness statements. Too close: David Cameron is seen embracing Rebekah Brooks before planting a kiss on each cheek at a glamorous society party . He said that James Eadie QC’s . application on behalf of the Government stated that ‘recent events have . underlined and brought into sharp focus the desirability of advance . notice’ – a reference to the  Jeremy Hunt affair. Mr Hunt was disadvantaged by not . having prior notice of 163 pages of emails between his office and News . Corporation which were submitted to the inquiry last month as part of . Rupert Murdoch’s evidence. The documents appeared  to suggest Mr . Hunt’s office had been helping News Corporation to win its bid to take . full control of BSkyB, and had leaked sensitive information to a Murdoch . lobbyist in advance. The fallout led to the resignation of Mr Hunt’s special adviser and left the minister fighting for his political life. Chris Hutchings, a specialist in media . law and partner at Hamlins LLP, said: ‘This is a controversial move by . the Government because the hearing to decide who would be allowed core . participant status for the third part of the inquiry was held more than a . month ago. ‘The Government chose not to make an . application at that stage, and the fact that they are doing so now, so . late in the day, suggests they are reacting to events of the past week, . and that this has come out of anxiety and nervousness.’ Friends: The PM and Rebekah Brooks live close together and it is rumoured Mr Cameron texted her up to 12 times a day . On Thursday Andy Coulson is likely to . be asked about how he got the job as the Prime Minister's spin doctor before . being forced to resign because of the phone hacking scandal. While Mrs Brooks could also lift the . lid on her friendship with the Prime Minister, and there is speculation . emails and text messages sent between Mr Cameron . and the former News International chief executive could be published. Lord Justice Leveson agreed that the individual ministers could seek the status, as long as long as they did not try to question other witnesses or make opening and closing submissions. All but one of the ministers have already submitted written witness statements to the inquiry, the hearing was told. Lord Justice Leveson stressed: 'There can be no question of access being sought for the purpose of preparing evidence.' The inquiry chairman insisted that all the ministers and their advisers must sign a confidentiality pledge not to leak any of the material they see in advance. He said: 'I mean absolutely no discourtesy to ministers or those who will have to assist them, but the rule must apply to everyone.' Without naming him, Lord Justice Leveson accused Labour MP Chris Bryant, who has core participant status, of showing 'total disregard' for the confidentiality agreement he has signed. Speaking in the House of Commons last week, Mr Bryant quoted from a then-unreleased document listing meetings between Mr Cameron and Rupert Murdoch. It came after James . Murdoch's evidence last week included more than 100 damaging emails between one of Culture Secretary Jeremy . Hunt’s special advisers, Adam Smith, and a Rupert Murdoch lobbyist. Mrs Brooks has kept all the texts she . received from the Prime Minister, of which there may be more than 12 a . day, it was claimed today. The Government could have applied for the . special status more than a year ago but last week's furore appears to . have sparked action from within Whitehall. Prime Minister David Cameron and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt applied today for the right to see Leveson Inquiry documents and witness statements in advance. The Prime Minister said last July that 'with 20:20 hindsight' he would not have hired Mr Coulson in May 2007, four months after he resigned from the Sunday tabloid over the jailing of royal reporter Clive Goodman for phone hacking. Storm: During his evidence last week James Murdoch, left, released more than 100 e-mails that left Jeremy Hunt, right, fighting for his job . Mr Coulson, 44, became Downing Street’s communications chief in May 2010 but quit in January 2011, saying controversy over the hacking scandal was making his job impossible. His Leveson Inquiry evidence will be the first time he has spoken publicly since being arrested by Scotland Yard on suspicion of phone hacking and corruption last July. He was bailed and has not been charged. Mrs Brooks, 43, edited the News of the World and The Sun before becoming chief executive of Mr Murdoch’s UK newspapers division News International in September 2009. She and her racehorse trainer husband Charlie are key members of the influential 'Chipping Norton set', which also includes Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha, Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, and Mr Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth and her PR guru husband Matthew Freud. The inquiry has already heard that Mrs Brooks regularly met Mr Cameron and other top politicians along with Rupert and James Murdoch. She hosted a Christmas dinner on December 23 2010, just two days after Business Secretary Vince Cable was stripped of his responsibility for media takeovers for saying he had 'declared war' on the Murdochs’ News Corporation empire. Mrs Brooks’s wedding on June 13 2009 was attended by Mr Cameron and former prime minister Gordon Brown. Mr Cameron was forced to admit in March that he rode a retired police horse loaned to Mrs Brooks by Scotland Yard from 2008 to 2010. Mrs Brooks has twice been arrested by Scotland Yard detectives investigating allegations of phone hacking, corrupt payments to public officials and an attempt to pervert the course of justice. She was bailed and has not been charged. The Leveson Inquiry’s lawyers will not question Mrs Brooks or Mr Coulson about anything that could prejudice the continuing police inquiries or any potential future trials.","Ministers applied to be 'core participants' in the probe allowing them to get all documents in advance .

Newt Gingrich may not have much of a shot at becoming President, but he is refusing to go quietly. And while he is no longer talking about the colonising the Moon, he does have plans which cover the entire globe. The former House Speaker told the National Rifle Association today that gun ownership should be a right for everyone in the world, and called on the UN to adopt a treaty enforcing this. Outspoken: Newt Gingrich has proposed to extend gun rights to the whole world . Speech: He revealed his ambitious plan at the NRA convention in St Louis . Mr Gingrich told the convention in St Louis: 'I believe the NRA has been too timid.' Arguing that more guns would reduce violent crimes like rape and child murder, he promised that if elected to the White House he would push the UN to extend the right to bear arms to the rest of the world. 'The Second Amendment is an amendment for all mankind,' he said. Rick Santorum, whose own fight for the Republican nomination ended this week, also struck an aggressively pro-gun tone as he revealed he had signed up his disabled three-year-old daughter to the NRA. 'Karen and I are life members of the NRA, and we wanted to announce today that now Bella is a life member of the NRA too,' he said. 'I hope it is a long life.' The former Pennsylvania Senator claimed that his wife was an even more enthusiastic gun user than he was. 'When it comes to gun rights advocates I have to say I don't hold a candle to my wife,' he said. 'I am a hunter and I am a gun owner, but she owns way more guns than I do.' Frontrunner: Mitt Romney appeared with his wife Ann to outline his vision for gun rights if he is elected President . Committed: Rick Santorum has signed up his toddler daughter to the NRA . However, the day's main event was a speech from probable GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who argued that Barack Obama had not protected gun owners during his time in office. 'We need a President who will enforce current laws, not create new ones that only serve to burden lawful gun owners,' Mr Romney told thousands of NRA members. 'President Obama has not. I will.' Mr Obama has said relatively little about firearms, deeply disappointing gun-control groups. Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said the president's record 'makes clear the he supports and respects the Second Amendment, and we'll fight back against any attempts to mislead voters.' The gathering of gun enthusiasts comes as Mr Romney is trying to woo conservative groups to consolidate his base after fending off challengers on his right. His relationship with gun owner groups is uneasy. Running for the Senate in 1994, Mr Romney said: 'I don't line up with the NRA.' A decade later he became a lifetime NRA member. On Friday, he told the group: 'We need a president who will stand up for the rights of hunters, sportsmen, and those seeking to protect their homes and their families. President Obama has not. I will.' Starting young: 12-year-old Bailey Chappuis checks out a Beretta ARX 160 . Browsing: A visitor looks at a display of shotguns at the NRA convention . Asked for details to support the claims, Mr Romney's campaign said Mr Obama has appointed judges, including Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, who have supported moves such as placing temporary limits on importing semiautomatic assault weapons. The campaign also said Attorney General Eric Holder has not adequately backed people's rights to own and use firearms. But gun-control groups such as the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence have expressed dismay over the President's lack of attention to their concerns. Campaigning in 2008, Mr Obama said: 'I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms... There are some commonsense gun safety laws that I believe in. But I am not going to take your guns away.' When Mr Romney ran successfully for Massachusetts Governor in 2002, the NRA gave his Democratic opponent a higher rating on gun-rights issues. Massachusetts quadrupled its gun-licensing fee while Mr Romney was governor. He signed a law that made permanent a ban on assault-type weapons, although it was coupled with some measures backed by gun-rights groups. As he was considering his first presidential run in 2006, Mr Romney became a lifetime NRA member. He drew ridicule in 2008 by claiming he sometimes hunts 'small varmints.' He showed more humility last month in Alabama, where he said he hoped to go hunting with a friend who 'can actually show me which end of the rifle to point.' Mr Romney's speech prompted a bit of gun control at the gun convention on Friday. Signs posted outside the hall where he was speaking said: 'Concealed Firearms or Weapons are Prohibited on the Premises.'","Romney promises to defend right to bear arms .

Engaged: Garrett Coble, 29, a recently engaged assistant professor at Northeastern State University in Oklahoma, was also among the fatalities . Bad feeling: Mr Coble's fiancee, pictured beside him, narrowly flew with him Friday but chose to drive after her father told her he had a bad feeling about it . Mr Coble, a professor at Northeastern State University in Broken Arrow, . Okla., was a longtime friend of Teen Mania and had served with the group . on 15 mission trips, Mr Luce said. Mr Sheets, who was flying the plane, was the son of a former Air Force pilot who now flies commercial jets. 'He had flown with his dad all of his life,' Mr Luce said. 'He had been . trained and checked out on this plane. He had flown this plane a number . of times, and was very well-versed on it.' According to Tulsa World, he would often spend his Friday afternoon's flying medical support flights. 'He was just a wonderful young man, . God-fearing man, it's a terrible loss,' said Bill Austin, a Tennessee . plane dealer speaking to Fox23.

Barack Obama sought to make his newfound enthusiasm for gay marriage a campaign issue as he appeared on The View to defend his much-talked-about announcement. In an interview set to air tomorrow, the President told the hosts of the ABC daytime chat show that the controversial debate would be 'a big contrast in the campaign' against Republican Mitt Romney. Mr Obama announced, 'I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,' during another ABC interview last Wednesday. The historic declaration is intended to fire up liberal activists who consider gay marriage to be a hugely symbolic social issue. Interview: Barack Obama discussed gay marriage while appearing on daytime talk show The View . Campaigning: The President gets up close and personal with Joy Behar during his appearance on The View, which airs on Tuesday . It is believed that one in six of the President's donation 'bundlers' for his re-election campaign is gay, and many of his supporters have been enthusiastic about Mr Obama's record on gay rights. But he faces a backlash from socially conservative black pastors, some of whom are warning that it could cost him the White House in November. Mr Romney opposes same-sex marriage but has been relatively silent on the issue over the last week, as senior Republicans have insisted the election should focus on economic rather than social issues. Mr Obama told The View: 'This is going to be a big contrast in the campaign, because you’ve got Governor Romney saying we should actually have a constitutional amendment installing the notion that you can’t have same-sex marriages.' He added: 'This is something that historically had been determined at the state level and part of my believing ultimately that civil unions weren’t sufficient, and I’ve been a longtime supporter of civil unions for same-sex couples, was partly because of the issue of Social Security benefits and other laws.' Star quality: Mr Obama at a fundraiser in New York on Monday night with singer Ricky Martin . Speech: Mr Martin introduced the President at the event in the Rubin Museum of Art . Support: Actress Eva Longoria, a prominent backer of the President, was also at the fundraiser . Ron Paul, Mitt Romney's last remaining challenger for the Republican presidential nomination, announced on Monday that he would no longer campaign. The maverick libertarian will not contest the upcoming primaries, but has urged his supporters to stay involved in politics. A number of state GOP conventions have been dominated by Mr Paul's fans, who have squeezed out followers of Mr Romney in several places. In a message to his supporters, the Texas congressman wrote of his pride in delaying Mr Romney's nomination. 'Moving forward, however, we will no longer spend resources campaigning in primaries in states that have not yet voted,' Mr Paul added. 'Doing so with any hope of success would take many tens of millions of dollars we simply do not have. 'I encourage all supporters of liberty to make sure you get to the polls and make your voices heard, particularly in the local, state and congressional elections, where so many defenders of freedom are fighting and need your support.' Mr Romney is on track to capture the nomination this month. He has 973 of the 1,144 delegates required to formally become the GOP's nominee, while Rick Santorum has 264 and Newt Gingrich has 130. Mr Paul trails with 104 delegates. Mr Paul, who is leaving Congress after the next election, is unlikely to endorse Mr Romney as the party's nominee. The pair strongly clashed during the debates over foreign policy, and in interviews Mr Paul has refused to say he would champion Mr Romney's campaign. The President said he thought the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as being between a man and a woman, was unconstitutional, but did not reveal whether he would fight to repeal it. 'Congress is clearly on notice that I think it's a bad idea,' he said. Two hours after his announcement last Wednesday, Mr Obama held a telephone conference call with eight black ministers to explain the rationale behind the move. Several told the president that he stand on gay marriage might make it difficult for them to support him and could endanger his re-election. ‘They were wrestling with their ability to get over his theological position,’ said the Reverend Delman Coates, the pastor of Mount Ennon Baptist Church in Clinton, Maryland, who took part in the call. Speaking at his Rising Sun Baptist . Church in Baltimore on Sunday, the Reverend Emmett Burns told the . congregation that he would abstain from voting in November. He . told CNN: ‘People are saying that they don't support this, they don't . like this, they're disappointed with the President and they're planning . to stay home.’ The . decision to back gay marriage was, he said, a message to his ‘base’ of . voters: ‘I am going against your beliefs and your thoughts.’ Pastor Harry Jackson, from Hope . Christian Church in Beltsville, Maryland told WJZ television: ‘God said . in every home, there needs to be a representation of his glory through . manhood and femininity.’ Father . Erik Arnold of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Ellicott City, Maryland, . who is white, said of Mr Obama’s announcement: ‘I think it might be a . call to action for people to really express what they believe.’ Others . said that their views as pastors should not affect the rights of the . population at large. ‘To me, this is an issue of the separation of . church and state,’ Pastor Coates told WJZ. ‘We should not allow our subjective theological understandings prevent other citizens of this country from having equal rights. Mr Obama was elected in 2008 partly . on the back of overwhelming black support and very high turnout among . minority groups. But polls show that 49 per cent of blacks oppose gay . marriage, compared to 43 per cent of whites. Although . this proportion is slowly reducing, in line with all Americans, and . blacks are unlikely to vote for Mr Romney in large numbers, Democrats . fear that Mr Obama’s new stance could depress turnout. Announcement: Mr Obama revealed his support for gay marriage during an interview with ABC's Robin Roberts . Opponent: Mitt Romney, pictured speaking at Liberty University, wants to ban same-sex marriage but would prefer to focus on economic issues in the election campaign . Religious conservatives see an opportunity. ‘I think the president this past week took six or seven states he carried in 2008 and put them in play with this one ill-conceived position that he’s taken,’ Gary Bauer, a former Republican presidential candidate, told CNN. Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said on the same programme: ‘I’ve gotten calls from pastors across the nation, white and black pastors, who have said, ""You know what? I’m not sitting on the sidelines anymore.""’ The Romney campaign, however, is anxious to avoid getting drawn into a prolonged debate about the issue, believing that a relentless focus on the economy will benefit them most. At an address at the evangelical Liberty University in Virginia on Saturday, Mr Romney made uttered only one short sentence regarding the controversy: ‘Marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman.’","President appears on The View in interview to be aired on Tuesday .

Castrating a male dog is a traumatic but necessary procedure, for the animal and the owners – but a new era of neutering beckons for family hounds the world over. New York-based Ark Sciences has developed a compound that sterilises the dog and so avoids the need to lop off the testicles. It’s called ‘Zinc Neutering’, which involves a mixture of Zinc Gluconate,  L-Arginine (an amino acid) and purified water being injected into the dog’s scrotum. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . It's a dog's life: Ark Sciences has developed a formula that sterilises a hound within 30 days . In the mix: The compound contains Zinc Gluconate, L-Arginine (an amino acid) and purified water . Ark Sciences claims this method causes ‘permanent sterilisation with no adverse reactions needing medical treatment nearly 99 per cent of the time’. At the moment the Zinc Gluconate procedure is available for dogs three to 10 months old, with Ark Sciences expecting their compound to approved by the U.S Government for all dogs over three months old before the formula hits the shelves this year. So far 300 animals have received the treatment. The company’s website explains that the compound works by killing off sperm and permanently blocking the tubes in the testicles. Permanent solution: Ark Sciences' formula kills off all sperm and blocks the tubes in the testicles . It takes 30 days for the procedure to work. Ark Sciences admits that there have been some minor side effects in a small number of cases, such as vomiting and loss of appetite. There have been no reports so far of any long-term ill-health. The company said: ‘We followed 40 dogs for over two years and have data on many of these dogs for over five years. Since 1999, when the initial clinical studies were performed, there have not been any reports of long-term side effects.’ Surgical castration has a number of disadvantages, aside from the anguish for some proud owners of taking away part of their dog’s masculinity. The procedure has been linked to the onset of cancer, hair loss and obesity. However, it’s carried out to stop dogs overbreeding and to prevent animal shelters becoming overwhelmed. It’s also used to subdue overly aggressive dogs.",'Zinc Neutering' sees a sterilising formula injected into the scrotum .

Ms Bruni-Sarkozy spent much of the election campaign defending ‘my man’ against what she saw as character attacks, and said she had also been victimised. ‘There’s this girl called Carla Bruni who does things that I do not do, who says things I do not say,’ she said, accusing reporters of creating an unpopular ‘clone’ of her.

In fact, if the villain was alive and had £5m to spare, this might have been his next purchase - a Rolls Royce decked out inside and out with 120kg of gold. This Rolls Royce Phantom - worth around £330,000 by itself - has been turned into a golden tribute for a mega-rich Middle Eastern business man by designer Liverpool-based Stuart Hughes. With gold worth more than £3m lavished on the vehicle - plus other customised work to make the car both bullet and grenade-proof - the value of the car is now close to £5.2m. One of a kind: The gold-plated Rolls Royce Phantom, worth more than £5m, has been customised for a businessman in the Middle East . Face of gold: The Rolls Royce has been trimmed with gold and is also bullet-proof . Liverpool gold designer Stuart Hughes created the masterpiece of a vehicle . In total, 120kg . of solid 18-carat gold has been applied to the car both inside . and out. The outside trims have all been decked with gold, and for the inside, molds were made of all the fixtures, and then used to plate the interior. The British designer has made a name for himself by apparently turning the most improbable of items into gold-decked luxury goods. Previously, he is said to have 'blinged' iPads, Blackberries, and even a miniature version of a Bugatti Veyron, which, at a value of £2m, costs almost twice as much as the real thing. The value of the Phantom may make it tempting to thieves - but think twice if you are tempted, as the Phantom is about as bullet-proof proof as they come. Swiss company Eurocash AG, based in Zug, approached Mr Hughes for the project, and while he carried out the gold work, Eurocash set about making the car practically indestructible. The vehicle can withstand more than 570 rounds fired into it from an AK47 assault rifle, as well as attacks from two hand grenades, meaning that unless the anonymous owner leaves the keys in the ignition, this car is likely to withstand any situations. Inside is golden: The leather interior is trimmed with gold, with every item in the car getting a moulded gold fascia . The back view: Most drivers might turn a shade of green if they see this ever see this view through the windscreen . Sean Connery takes on the 'gold standard' of film enemies - Gert Frobe as Goldfinger - in the 1964 Bond classic . However, the Phantom is by no means the most expensive car ever sold - just last month a classic Ferrari changed hands for £20.2million. The legendary Ferrari 250 GTO is the world’s most sought-after car, especially as there were only 39 models built between 1962 and 1964. This 1963 model - number 5095 - is believed to have been sold by British businessman Jon Hunt, who bought it in 2008 for what was then world-record at £15.7million.","£5m Phantom can withstand 570 rounds from an AK-47 assault rifle - and two grenades .

Hacked: Tony Blair is believed to have been targeted by a 17-year-old heading a group called TeamPoison . A teenage boy is accused of heading a group of hackers who targeted Tony Blair, MI5 and the BNP. TeamPoison claimed responsibility for hacking Scotland Yard’s anti-terrorist hotline and posted recordings on YouTube. The 17-year-old was arrested on Friday and police seized all of his computer equipment. He was released on bail over the weekend. He is also accused of hacking Nato and Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg. The teenager, from Newcastle, was back at his parents' £150,000 home yesterday. He answered the door to a reporter yesterday and began talking before a woman told him to 'shut the door', the Daily Mirror reported. The teenager was held under the Computer Misuse Act. TeamPoison has claimed responsibility for more than 1,400 offences - including 'denial of service' attacks. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Computer equipment has been seized and is undergoing a detailed forensic examination.' The arrest comes after TeamPoison claimed it was 'easy' to bypass Scotland Yard's security which they said was 'from the 80s'. They claim to have accessed a server from Malaysia to record conversations. The force launched an investigation after being made aware that the phone calls may have been hacked. Scotland . Yard's hotline is understood to have been hit with more than 700 calls . before an American-sounding caller, using the name Trick, told them they . were being 'pranked'. Scroll down for audio . Online presence: This image appears on the website of the Metropolitan Police, urging members of the public to call the confidential anti-terrorist hotline . Detectives said 'appropriate action would be taken' after a number of recordings were posted on YouTube. In one of the clips, a man identifying himself as Trick is heard telling an officer: 'Knowledge is power... We embarrass governments and f*** the police.' 'Trick' is later heard laughing when a . woman comes on to the line to tell him that the phone call was being . passed on to the FBI. The hackers overwhelmed a computer server used to host sensitive phone calls using a simple computer script to infiltrate the system. The 'Asterisk' phone server was controlled for 24 hours by the anarchist group, TeamPoison. Hacking phone networks - known as 'phreaking', a term which was in use before computer hacking even existed - allows malicious hackers to listen in or send messages to phone users on computerised exchanges. 'Phreaking' was a predecessor to today's hacking - Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was a 'phreaker' himself in the early Seventies. Nowadays, computerised phone systems mean that hackers can use computer-hacking skills to 'get inside' phone systems and eavesdrop on calls. In another recording, officers appear to be discussing counter-terror operations while TeamPoison listens in. The group claimed to have then made . calls to MI6 - but it is understood they were in fact picked up by the . Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command. Trick said the group bypassed outdated technology and used a server from Malaysia to record conversations. A statement from Trick read: 'The phone denial of service was done via a custom script for Asterisk which was installed on an overseas server. 'The conversation was tapped into via a private phreaking method, their phone system is old and we found a way to get in via basic but private phreaking technique.' TeamPoison said it deluged counter-terrorism officers with phone calls for 24 hours, ensuring no other calls could get through. The . group claimed its attacks were prompted by a recent decision made by . the European Court of Human Rights, which allowed UK-linked terror . suspects Babar Ahmad and Adel Abdel to be extradited to America. By . targeting the phones, the group essentially carried out the telephonic . equivalent of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack - an approach often used . by online hackers against Government websites. Another recording released by the hacktivists allegedly features MI6 staff discussing the group's attack. Hacked: Scotland Yard launched an investigation after discovering that confidential calls to its anti-terrorist hotline were allegedly recorded by hackers . Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist . hotline was set up in 1991 to encourage the public to report possible . terrorist activity, and has been the subject of several costly newspaper . and radio advertising campaigns. A section of the Metropolitan Police's website dedicated to the hotline gives the following advice to users: .

They do say it's lonely at the top, so France's new president Francois Hollande must have been grateful for a helping hand from German chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday. Mr Hollande was the guest of honour at a red-carpet ceremony in Berlin, but the French newcomer looked decidedly out of his element - understandably nervous as the world watched the first meeting between Europe's new power duo. It was an ominous first day for Mr Hollande, having been soaked through by a torrential downpour during a parade in France, and then arriving late for his meeting with Mrs Merkel after his plane was struck by lightning and had to be diverted. Scroll down for video . This way Francois: While French president Francois Hollande looks decidedly awkward - his arms rigidly by his side like a naughty schoolboy - German chancellor Angela Merkel shows him the way . No no, this way: Mr Hollande seems to be off in all directions outside the Federal Chancellory in Berlin, but Mrs Merkel patiently points him in the right direction or offers a helpful tap on the arm . On the ground, he stood on the wrong side of the red carpet and fidgeted constantly - with Mrs Merkel giving him a helpful push in the right direction. Later, as Mrs Merkel spoke of her determination to keep up the Franco-German cooperation that flourished under Mr Hollande's conservative predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr Hollande fumbled in his pocket for pen and paper to take notes. When it came to his turn at the microphone, Mr Hollande repeatedly used hands and arms to stress how reasonable his arguments were. Shoulder charge: When hand signals would not do the trick, Mrs Merkel resorted to a good old-fashioned barge to get Mr Hollande moving in the right direction . We made it: By the time the two leaders had finally found their way to waiting reporters, it looked like Mr Hollande had relaxed a little bit - to the relief of Mrs Merkel . Off to a bad start: Mr Hollande's excessive hand gestures and talk of amending Mrs Merkel's European policies did not endear himself to the German chancellor . While the two leaders talk about wanting to continue the status quo between their two countries, a body language expert might have had more to say on Mr Hollande's intentiions. At one point, Mr Hollande explained why he wanted to tamper with Mrs Merkel's fiscal pact, agreed by 25 European states, to make it more growth-oriented. Mrs Merkel simply shrugged and smiled at reporters. The German leader and Mr Sarkozy were so different in character that aides thought they would never get along. Raining on his parade: In weather that could have been orchestrated by his opponent Nicolas Sarkozy, the heavens opened on Mr Hollande's motorcade through Paris . Still chucking it down: Mr Hollande endured more outdoor ceremonies in the rain yesterday as he placed flowers at the monument to the Unknown soldier at the Arc de Triomphe . This never happened to the other guy: Mr Hollande looks like he might be regretting his decision to run as French leader after his inauguration . Mrs Merkel, a physicist from the former East Germany who guards an intensely private home life, seemed polar opposite to Mr Sarkozy - dubbed 'President Bling-Bling' because of his flashy tastes and marriage to self-promoting singer/model/actress Carla Bruni. But the two conservatives saw eye-to-eye on the euro crisis to such an extent that media commentators lumped them together as a single entity - 'Merkozy'. However, it might take some time before the world starts hearing of 'Merkollande'. Mr Hollande's first day in office was not so much a baptism of fire as it was a baptism of water - and lightning. The man dubbed ‘Mr Normal’ by the French endured a first 24 hours in charge that were anything but normal. The day started well enough, with the new leader exchanging pleasantries with outgoing president Mr Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace - and being sworn in as the seventh president of the Fifth Republic. But it all went downhill from there. Poking through the sunroof of a small £25,000 hybrid Citroen DS5, and surrounded by guardsmen on horse-back, he was driven up the Champs Elysees waving to well-wishers. But - in weather that could have only been choreographed by Mr Sarkozy himself - the heavens opened and rained heavily on Mr Hollande’s parade. By the time he arrived at the Arc de Triomphe, he was a mess; his black suit and white shirt clinging to his body, and water dripping uncharismatically from from his spectacles. If he thought things would improve when he boarded his plane to meet Mrs Merkel, he was wrong. His Falcon 7X was hit by lightning and he was forced to return to Paris, to board a second aircraft.

"By . Jaya Narain . UPDATED: . 03:05 EST, 9 March 2012 . Thief: Susan Barcock, 52, recorded the money she stole from Cancer Research UK in her diary . For most thieves, covering one’s tracks is usually the utmost priority. But the concept was, apparently, unfamiliar to Susan Barcock as she stole thousands of pounds from the charity shop where she worked – then boasted about her exploits in a series of Dear Diary entries. Volunteering in her local Cancer Research UK shop, the unemployed 52-year-old appeared to be a model citizen helping raise money for good causes. But in reality she was skimming cash from the daily takings and paying it into her bank account. She also stole thousands of pounds from an elderly widow, it emerged. When police began investigating how money was going missing from the shop, they had only to open Barcock’s diaries to find the evidence that convicted her in court this week. Among the individually dated entries were: ‘Good day @ shop for me. £60. So got money in bank for tomorrow & £35 to spend. Oh yes.’ Another read: ‘B***** good day at shop £213. Man brought bag of coins in – £75 for shop £35 for me, well I had to count it.’ An entry dated July 14, 2008 said: ‘A good day as far as I’m concerned. £50. But not so for shop.’ Another brazenly noted: ‘I was in charge @ C Shop and it was a good day for me £91. Oh yes.’ And on January 18, 2010 she wrote: ‘Good day in shop £124, £80 for me. Oh yes!’ Martin McRobb, prosecuting, told Warrington Crown Court: ‘When confronted with her diary, the defendant could do little more than admit to the police she had stolen this money. ‘She aroused suspicion while she was at this particular place of work but nothing had been proven. Had it not been for her personal diary entries which formed all the evidence there would have been no evidence against her.’ '£124 for shop, £80 for me': Volunteer Susan Barcock repeatedly helped herself to money from the Cancer Research UK shop in Warrington, Cheshire . Tuesday 29: A good day £207 shop, £50 for me! February 9: Good day £189 for shop £35 for me. Monday, March 2: I was in charge @ C Shop and it was a good day for me £91. Oh yes. Monday May 18: Shop quiet £87 only got £30 for me. June 15: Bloody good day at shop £213. Man brought bag of coins in - £75 for shop £35 for me, well I had to count it. Sunday 13 April 2008: Dead £37 for shop £15 for me hee hee . Saturday 14 July 2008: A good day as far as I'm concerned. £50. But not so for shop. Monday 3 Nov 2008: Good day @ shop for me. £60. So got money in bank for tomorrow & £35 to spend. Oh yes. January 18, 2010: Good day in shop £124, £80 for me oh yes! In total Barcock, who worked at Cancer Research UK in Warrington from 2008 to January 2010, pocketed £2,127 from the shop. She was eventually caught out when a . widow she had been helping around her home realised money was going . missing from her house and bank account. The 78-year-old victim noticed her . bank statement showed withdrawals she knew nothing about. It emerged . Barcock had also stolen £6,356 from her – including £2,200 in cash from . the widow’s house. When police searched Barcock’s home in . Orford, Warrington, they unearthed three personal diaries dating from . 2008, brazenly logging the daily amounts of money she had stolen from . the charity shop. Barcock was spared jail after pleading guilty to theft and false representation. The court was told how she was of . previous good character and had held a managerial position before she . lost her job in 2006. She has given up her car to help pay back the . money she stole, it heard. Natalia Cornwall, defending, said: ‘She fully recognises the seriousness of this offence. ‘She has led an honest lifestyle but it wasn’t until 2006 that this defendant started to have difficulties in her life.’ Judge Nicholas Woodward sentenced . Barcock to four months in prison, suspended for 12 months. She is also . subject to a six-month curfew from 6pm to 6am and a  12-month . supervision order.","Susan Barcock stole £2,127 from Cancer Research UK .

Wardrobe nightmare: Simon Cowell's intruder was found hiding on a shelf in the BGT star's walk-in . The woman accused of breaking into Simon Cowell's home was found hiding on a seven-foot shelf in the pop mogul's walk-in wardrobe with blood-smeared walls by police. Armed offices searched the property after the X Factor supremo called for help after coming face to face with Leanne Zaloumis, 29, who he says broke into his £9million property by smashing his bathroom window. Cowell, 52, was left terrified after seeing the woman, who was said to be standing on the roof outside his shattered bathroom window holding a rock above her head, with her hands covered in blood. He fled to his bedroom and his staff called Scotland Yard who immediately sent a squad of armed officers to his home. After searching the grounds and gardens, firearms officers found an intruder hiding on a shelf seven feet up in a walk-in wardrobe with blood-smeared walls adjoining Cowell’s bedroom. Yesterday Cowell was not present to see the accused woman, wearing a baggy grey sweatshirt, appear in court for the first time since the alleged break-in on Saturday night. A charge of aggravated burglary with intent was read to her. Paul Mitchell, prosecuting, said she ‘entered, as a trespasser, a dwelling with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm upon a person therein and at the time of committing the said burglary had with you a weapon of offence, namely a broken house brick’. West London Magistrates’ Court heard how Cowell was watching TV in his  bedroom at 10.30pm when he heard a ‘loud bang’ in his bathroom on the first floor of his lavish home in West London, which used to be the French ambassador’s residence. On entering the bathroom to investigate, he was confronted by a figure standing on a flat roof outside the window screaming as she held a rock aloft, Mr Mitchell said. He told the court: ‘On Saturday 24th March around half past ten in the evening, Simon Cowell, a relatively high-profile celebrity, was watching TV in his bedroom. 'He then hears what he describes as a loud bang that he says comes from his bathroom which is located next to his bedroom.' ‘He goes to investigate and sees a figure outside his first-floor bathroom window. He could see that the window was already damaged and there was broken glass on the floor and around the window frame.’ Tuning in: Cowell was watching himself on The Jonathan Ross Show when the break-in occurred . Cowell has said that outside the window he could see a woman who was shouting and holding a rock above her head. He said he tried to speak to her but she continued to shout at him and then started to hit the window again with the rock. Panicked, Cowell ran for help and a member of staff called police while others searched the garden and grounds. Within minutes, firearms officers had arrived. With weapons drawn they searched his home, eventually finding a woman hiding on the shelf in the wardrobe where blood had been smeared on the walls during the ‘disturbing and frenzied’ break-in. A woman was arrested at the scene and taken to a West London police station. Nothing was found on her apart from a few possessions including a coat and a handbag which did not belong to Cowell. He told a friend: ‘It was scary . . . she was smashing her way into my bathroom with a rock and wouldn’t stop. Then she hid in the house.’ Homebody: Cowell pictured outside his London home in 2010 . 'Freaked out': The TV judge, pictured in one of his Bentleys, suffered a previous security lapse in 2008 when his £140,000 luxury car was found to have been bugged with a magnetic tracking device . Cowell has 24-hour security at the property, which includes a team of guards based there. Bodyguards also join him at the studios during filming for his TV shows including Britain’s Got Talent and The X Factor. Yesterday experts were examining how to make the mansion more secure. Staff were cleaning the house to remove any traces of glass and blood left in the bathroom and wardrobe, which were said to have been caused by lacerations to the intruder’s hands. Zaloumis spoke yesterday only to  confirm her name and her address in Catford, South-East London. District Judge James Henderson remanded her in custody to appear again at Isleworth Crown Court on June 12.","Leanne Zaloumis, 29, remanded in custody by magistrates .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 16:09 EST, 6 March 2012 . In the last two days of his life, Tyler Clementi visited his roommate's Twitter page 38 times and saved screen shots of two messages posted there. One proclaimed that the roommate saw Mr Clementi ‘making out with a dude’. The other ‘dared’ friends to use a web chat program to watch when Mr Clementi was due to have a second encounter with the man. Glance: Dharun Ravi looked at spectators during his trial at the Middlesex County Courthouse in New Brunswick, yesterday. He is accused of spying on his roommate . Jurors learned those details Tuesday . during the testimony of Gary Charydczak, a detective in the Middlesex . County Prosecutor's Office who testified in roommate Dharun Ravi's . criminal trial. The detective said he learned about Mr . Clementi's computer use from examining the hard drive of the laptop . that was found in his Rutgers University dorm room. He displayed the Tweets that he said were saved to Mr Clementi's hard drive under the names ‘untitled.jpg’ and ‘secondtime.jpg’. Twenty-year-old Ravi faces 15 counts . including bias intimidation and invasion of privacy against Mr Clementi, . who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge on September . 22, 2010- one day after authorities say Ravi attempted to spy on him. Prosecutors say Ravi used Twitter . first to tell followers that he had seen his roommate ‘making out with a . dude’ on September 19, and two days later to ‘dare’ them to video chat . him when Mr Clementi had again asked to have the room to himself so he . could have a guest over. Authorities also say Ravi told friends about the expected dorm-room liaison through other means, including text messages. During testimony Monday, jurors were shown texts he sent to a friend from high school who was then attending Cornell University. Textual evidence: Ravi's friend from high school Michelle Huang testified on Monday saying that he told her that he was planning to host a 'viewing party' for the second time that Mr Clementi asked for the room . Friends like these: Molly Wei (left) and Alissa Agarwal (right) both testified about their involvement in the case . In one part of the exchange, the friend, Michelle Huang, texted Ravi: ‘Watch out, he may come for you when you're sleeping.’ Ravi responded that he had his computer set to alert him if anyone was in his bed when he wasn't there. ‘It keeps the gays away,’ he said. The exchange may help prosecutors show . that Ravi had malice toward gays - a necessary element to persuade . jurors to convict Ravi on the bias intimidation charges he faces. But he . and his friend went on to talk about some of their gay friends. In testimony earlier Tuesday, Rutgers . computer system manager Timothy Hayes told jurors it appears Ravi's . computer was used in two video chats on September 21, 2010. That doesn't prove that Ravi spied on . his roommate, but it may bolster the prosecution's case that he was . preparing to attempt to spy on Mr Clementi that night, just one day . before Mr Clementi committed suicide. Tragic end: Rutgers student Tyler Clementi jumped off the George Washington Bridge in 2010 after webcam footage showing he and another man kissing circulated the internet . Residence hall: Clementi and Ravi lived in Room 30 of Davidson Hall . Authorities say Ravi used his webcam . to see his roommate and another man kissing on September 19 and viewed . it from the room across the hall from his own. Mr Hayes told jurors that the data the . university collected was not able to show online interactions between . two computers on the same wing of the dorm. Records show that the computers of . both Ravi and another dorm resident, Molly Wei, had a record of a video . chat September 19 at about the time she said that they briefly used it . to see Mr Clementi and the other man kissing. Mystery witness: A man who identifies himself only as M.B. told the court today that he noticed the webcam in Clementi and Ravi's room and that he and Clementi met on a gay dating website . Prosecutors also have been building the case that Ravi went to the rooms of dorm mates that evening to test his webcam. They tried to use Hayes' testimony to . corroborate that. He said there was a web chat between his computer and . Lokesh Ojha's at 6.58pm that evening, and another with Alissa Agarwal . starting 46 minutes later. Both those students testified that Ravi showed them how they could use a web chat program to see what was happening in his room. There has been no evidence that anyone used a videochat service to spy on Mr Clementi that night. Court documents suggest that Ravi's computer was unplugged before his guest arrived. Mr Hayes said it seems that Ravi's computer was unplugged for about two hours that night, beginning at 9.25pm.

As expected, North Carolina voters approved a constitutional amendment on Tuesday defining marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman, making it the 30th state to adopt such a ban. With several large counties still not reporting, unofficial returns showed the amendment passing nearly 60 per cent to 40 per cent. Supporters of the bill from around the state held rallies, including Vote for Marriage and Coalition to Protect All N.C. families. Vote for Marriage lavishly celebrated with a seven-tier wedding cake. Shocked: Seth Keel, centre, is consoled by his boyfriend, Ian Chambers, left, and his mother Jill Hinton, during a concession speech at an Amendment One opposition party .

Man and wife: A plastic bride and groom are poised atop the wedding cake; North Carolina becomes the 30th state to declare marriage is between a man and a woman . In the final days before the vote, . members of President Obama's cabinet expressed support for gay . marriage and former President Bill Clinton recorded phone messages . urging voters to reject the amendment. Opponents also held marches, ran TV ads and gave speeches, including one by Jay Bakker, son of televangelists Jim Bakker and the late Tammy Faye Bakker. Meanwhile, supporters had run their own ad campaigns and church leaders urged Sunday congregations to vote for the amendment. The Rev. Billy Graham, who at 93 remains influential even though his last crusade was in 2005, was featured in full-page newspaper ads supporting the amendment. Both sides spent a combined $3million on their campaigns. Soon after the news got out, prominent personalities took to Twitter to voice their opinions. Meghan McCain wrote a series of tweets encouraging her gay friends to stay strong.

She wrote: ‘I for one absolutely refuse to stop fighting until every American has the same right to love and marriage that I do,’ later adding, ‘God loves us and God doesn’t make mistakes.’ Ellen DeGeneres made her issue with the bill personal. ‘Getting married was one of the greatest things I have ever done,’ she tweeted. ‘I hope everyone in North Carolina gets the same opportunity someday.’ Modern Family actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson wrote: ‘This is an interest fact I just learned: First cousins can marry in North Carolina. (Unless they are of the same sex, I assume.’ First cousins in North Carolina can, in fact, marry, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. However, state law prohibits double-cousin marriage.

Landmark vote: North Carolina residents voted to pass a constitutional amendment defining marriage as solely between a man and a woman . Decision: Gretchen Colby, far left, casts her vote at Belville Elementary School in Brunswick County, North Carolina . North Carolina law already bans gay . marriage, like nine other states, but an amendment would effectively . slam the door shut on same-sex marriages. The amendment also goes beyond state . law by voiding other types of domestic unions from carrying legal . status, which opponents warn could disrupt protection orders for . unmarried couples. Six states - all in the Northeast except Iowa - and the District of Columbia allow same sex marriages. Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, and the District of Columbia all allow same-sex marriages. Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, and Rhode Island all allow civil unions, which offer spousal rights to same-sex couples. California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington state grant nearly all spousal rights and allow domestic partnerships. The North Carolina amendment was . placed on the ballot after Republicans took over control of the state . Legislature after the 2010 elections, a role the GOP hadn't enjoyed for . 140 years. Joe Easterling, who described himself as a devout Christian, voted for the amendment at a polling place in Wake Forest. 'I . know that some people may argue that the Bible may not necessarily be . applicable, or it should not be applicable, on such policy matters. But . even looking at nature itself, procreation is impossible without a man . and a woman. ‘And because of those things, I think it is important that the state of North Carolina's laws are compatible with the laws of nature but, more importantly, with the laws of God.' Linda Toanone, who voted against the amendment, said people are born gay and it is not their choice.'We think everybody should have the same rights as everyone else. If you're gay, lesbian, straight - whatever,' she said. The way we live now: North Carolina joins the dark blue states that have constitutional provisions that define marriage strictly between a man and a woman . North Carolina is the latest presidential swing state to weigh in on gay marriage. Florida, Virginia and Ohio all have constitutional amendments against gay marriage, and Obama's election-year vagueness on gay marriage has come under fresh scrutiny. Obama, who supports most gay rights, has stopped short of backing gay marriage. Marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state. -North Carolina state constitution ammendement . Without clarification, he's said for the past year and a half that his personal views on the matter are 'evolving.' Education Secretary Arne Duncan broke ranks with the White House on Monday, stating his unequivocal support for same-sex marriage one day after Vice President Joe Biden said he is 'absolutely comfortable' with same-sex married couples getting the same rights at heterosexual married couples. One fault line that could determine the result is generational. Older voters, who tend to be more reliable voters, are expected to back the amendment. State House Speaker Thom Tillis, a Republican from a Charlotte suburb, said even if the amendment is passed, it will be reversed as today's young adults age. 'It's a generational issue,' Tillis told a student group at North Carolina State University in March about the amendment he supports. 'If it passes, I think it will be repealed within 20 years.' Sharp contrast: In June of 2011, revellers celebrated outside the Stonewall Inn in New York after the state passed a bill allowing gay marriage . A cause for celebration: Revelers celebrated in front of the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan's West Village following the passing of the same sex marriage bill . The amendment also goes beyond state law by voiding other types of domestic unions from carrying legal status, which opponents warn could disrupt protection orders for unmarried couples. 'Also, that amendment is against women, I believe, because also underneath the amendment, other laws are saying that people who aren't married at all, they can't file for domestic abuse cases, if they're living with their significant other. Which is wrong,' Toanone said. In North Carolina, more than 500,000 voters had cast their ballot before Tuesday, which was more than the 2008 primary when Obama and Hillary Clinton were fighting for the Democratic presidential nomination. Both sides said that bodes well for them.","North Carolina will be 30th state to approve ban on gay marriages .

On one occasion Cameron was caught single-handedly lowering a 12ft metal girder from his bedroom window on a piece of old rope. On . another occasion he was filmed with sparks flying on to the street as . he recklessly operated an angle grinder on his front garden wall. Housing bosses confirmed they had lost patience with Cameron and were giving him the boot.

The pensioner is being evicted after . he was finally ruled to have breached his tenancy agreement and ignored . an injunction he was served with last year. Stephen Meinhold, 55, a father of two, who lives below Cameron said his life had been made a 'living hell'. The former computer engineer said: 'There is constant crashing, sawing and chopping, which goes on for hours. 'It started when I moved in and he built a plane. He then spent years repairing bike engines in his little one bedroom flat. 'Then about two years ago he started building a boat. I have asked him to stop dozens of times but he just threatens me. 'He caused flooding on Christmas morning and even lowered a massive steel girder from his bedroom window entirely on his own. 'It's amazing he can do all this in his flat but he has caused havoc for the rest of us.

'I have been trying to get him stop and he has been taken to court but he just doesn’t listen. All I have ever wanted is peace and he has not allowed me to have that.' In September last year Genesis sought a court injunction preventing Cameron from undertaking large building work in his second floor flat, which is in a converted town house with three other apartments. But at the start on February 10 housing officers were forced to visit Cameron after receiving more complaints from distressed neighbours. He failed to comply with a final warning and a notice to possess his property was sent last week. A spokesman for housing association Genesis, said: 'Following repeated complaints about Mr Cameron we sought a court injunction to prevent further work from taking place. 'As the resident has consistently ignored the previous warnings and the injunction, Genesis has been left with no other alternative but to seek possession of the property. 'In terms of how Mr Cameron was building the plane and boat, he was constructing various bits in his flat. He claimed that the full thing was then being constructed away from his flat.'

Home to the smallest cathedral in Britain, the North Wales town of  St Asaph had been an ecclesiastical city for almost 1,500 years. Yesterday it became a city for real following a Royal announcement. Together with Perth in Scotland and Chelmsford in Essex, St Asaph was awarded city status to mark the Diamond Jubilee. The newly classed city of St Asaph has a population of around 3,400 - a fifteenth of the size of fellow new city Perth . The trio beat off 22 others to be granted the accolade. While many of its rivals spent thousands on their campaigns, councillors in St Asaph – population 3,400 – splashed out just £300 on their application. Bookmakers were so convinced it would not win that, just a couple of weeks ago, they were offering odds of 33-1 against it securing the title. Yesterday councillor Denise Hodgkinson, who helped devise the bid, said: ‘I was shocked but delighted when I heard the news – I just stood in my kitchen and cried. This is the third time we have applied for city status, so it was third time lucky. I’ve never put a bet on in my life – I wish I had done now.’ St Asaph may not be well known but one of its most famous sons is record Liverpool and Wales goalscorer Ian Rush.

To outsiders, St Asaph appears like a place that time forgot, with a high street barely wide enough for two cars to pass and no big chain stores or supermarkets. There is a cattle market every Thursday and, unlike the residents of other cities, locals still know their beat bobby by name. The city’s football team – St Asaph FC – play in the Vale of Clwyd and Conwy Premier League. Their ground, Roe Plas Meadows, is where the council uses a committee room to stage its monthly meetings. Neil Shaw, 47, has worked in the butcher’s shop since he was 12 when he was employed to deliver meat by bicycle. He said: ‘It’s great news for St Asaph. We were all brought up to believe we were a city, but now we are one for real.’ Although small, St Asaph has several claims to fame. Explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley – who is said to have uttered the immortal words ‘Dr Livingstone, I presume’ – spent his childhood years in its workhouse before moving to America. Other famous former residents include ex-Liverpool footballer Ian Rush and pop singer Lisa Scott-Lee from Steps. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the three former towns had won from an ‘exceptional’ field of entrants, which included Bolton, Doncaster and Reading. The awards were made by the Queen on the advice of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, following a competition to bid for civic honours launched in December 2010 . ‘I have been moved by the pride and passion which people have shown in putting their nominations forward,’ he said. There are currently 66 cities in the UK. City status is rarely granted, with only 14 new cities created during the 20th century. St Asaph is not the smallest city in Britain. That accolade belongs to St Davids in Pembrokeshire, West Wales – population 1,700. Happy in Chelmsford . Essex has never had a city before... so Chelmsford must be chuffed after finally getting the status it has fought for over 25 years. The leader of the Conservative-run council in Chelmsford, Roy Whitehead, said it was a great honour. 'The city of Chelmsford sounds a lot . better than the town of Chelmsford, so if we're going to get investment, . we'll be better off as a city,' he told the BBC. To mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, Chelmsford in Essex has been awarded city status . 'I am delighted that after almost 25 years of trying, the town of Chelmsford has been honoured by Her Majesty The Queen. 'It has always surprised me that Essex does not have a city within its boundaries. It is a tremendous honour for the town and will bring considerable joy to the local community.' Civic leaders in Medway in Kent were . magnanimous in defeat. Medway Council leader Rodney Chambers . said their losing bid showed the area has come a long way since the 1980s. 'I would like to congratulate the three . towns that have today gained city status,' he said. 'While we were, of course, hoping Medway . would gain city status, we believe the bid created a huge amount of national . publicity and this has helped raise our profile and show people how much this . area has to offer.' He added: 'The Medway of today is a . thriving area, with a large population and regeneration continuing apace. 'We know Medway's journey continues, but . it is definitely heading in the right direction.' 'Perth has had its dignity restored' The Provost of Perth today claimed that city status had 'restored its dignity'. Perth Provost Dr John Hulbert said the . success opened a 'glorious new chapter' for Perth, after the ancient Scottish . capital was stripped of its city status in 1975 as part of a local government . shake-up. Perth, which celebrated its 800th . anniversary last year, was an 'ecclesiastical city' because it had a cathedral . but was legally considered a town. Perth has today become classed as a city, opening a 'glorious new chapter' Dr Hulbert said: 'I am delighted that . official city status has been restored to Perth. Everyone in the council shares . my excitement at the prospect of a glorious new chapter in Perth's long . history. 'The City and Royal Burgh of Perth was . the capital of Scotland from the 9th century until 1437, and then officially . the Second City of Scotland until 1975. 'Even though city status was summarily . removed when local government was reorganised, Perth has continued to be known . as the ""Fair City"". Full restoration of its ancient dignity is long overdue. 'This decision reflects the fact that . Perth is at the forefront of Scottish life: a modern, dynamic, international . city, offering unrivalled business, artistic, educational, cultural and . sporting opportunities to its citizens and visitors. 'It is located at the hub of Scotland's . transport network, at the gateway to the Highlands, and in the midst of . remarkable scenery. 'Perth has many royal connections, and . is the home of the Black Watch, the Army's most famous infantry battalion. 'It is the home of home-grown . multi-national firms such as Scottish & Southern Electricity and . Stagecoach, and is an important centre for Aviva and Famous Grouse. 'It is a city that I am proud to serve.' Dr Hulbert thanked those who had . supported the campaign, including the leaders of all the political parties in . Scotland and the Lord Provosts and Provosts of the six existing cities of . Scotland, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling. Councillor Ian Miller, Leader of the SNP . Group on Perth & Kinross Council, said city status would have 'significant . and lasting benefits' for the economy across Perth and Kinross, particularly . through membership of the Scottish Government's now 'Seven Cities Alliance', . which grants access to seed-corn funding for inter-city region project . development. Cllr Alexander Stewart, leader of the . Conservative Group, added: 'Many people believe that Perth is already a city . but back in 1975 Perth was stripped of the right to be called a city. 'Today, . that wrong has been righted and Perth has been given back the status it rightly . deserves, and that status will open the door to so many opportunities in the . future.' Perth and Kinross Council launched a . claim for formal city status in 2005 after a search of its archives uncovered . the 'Golden Charter' of 1600 to back its claim.","Chelmsford in Essex and Perth in Scotland also awarded city status by the Queen .

Another 17 counties in the South West and the Midlands will be officially designated as 'water-stressed' today - the largest area suffering a water shortage since 1976. Although the hosepipe ban currently in force for 20million people has not yet been extended, contingency plans are being drawn up as the Environment Agency confirmed the drought is likely to last until Christmas. Water-free zone: Angie Evans walks along a dried up river bed near Chichester, West Sussex, today. More than 35million people are now living in the drought zone which is engulfing England . Running near empty: Isla Stanton, five, paddles in the depleted Bewl Water Reservoir near Lamberhurst, Kent . Worst water shortage since 1976: The half-full Bewl reservoir is holding just 50 per cent of its capacity as opposed to the 90 per cent it would normally hold at this time of year . Officials fear that a third dry winter could see a return to water rationing like that seen in 1976, when South West England didn't see rain for 45 days. Shortage: Residents collect water from a standpipe in Northam, Devon, in 1976 . During the drought, several large rivers, including the River Don, ran completely dry and food prices increased following the loss of £500million worth of crops. There were also large scale fires that affected moorland across the country and burnt around 50,000 trees. Denis Howell was appointed the Minister for Drought and the Drought Act was passed making water rationing and standpipes commonplace.

The River Severn - Britain’s longest . river - may completely dry up in places by the summer, with disastrous . consequences for plants, wildlife and fish stocks. A section near Ironbridge in . Shropshire is already causing concern - just 50 miles from Tewkesbury in . Gloucestershire where the Severn burst its banks, deluging dozens of . homes back in 2007. Despite the poor outlook, the Severn Trent water company, which serves eight million customers, has no plans for a hosepipe ban due to operating an . internal ‘water grid’ to move water from the wetter west of the region . to the drier east.

A former teacher convicted of having sex with a 15-year-old student in 2009 has been re-arrested - after her teen victim was found hiding in her closet. Lisa Lavoie, 26,a former teacher at Holyoke middle school, was caught after a probation officer made an unannounced visit to her home. He discovered the victim, now 18, hiding in Lavoie's closet. Repeat offender: Lisa Lavoie was rearrested after her probation officer found her former underage victim hiding in her closet . Pictured in court: Lavoie looked sullen-faced in her recent court appearance . Lavoie had been spared jail after the judge in her trial said he did not believe she was a sexual predator. She was given a sentence of five years’ probation in January 2011, after pleading guilty to statutory rape. Her re-arrest came after a probation officer made an unannounced call at Lavoie's home in Springfield, West Virginia. As the probation officer looked round the flat, she found her former lover, now aged, 18, hiding in her bedroom closet. Lavoie’s probation included several conditions including that she have no contact with the victim or his family, masslive.com reported. When she appeared in court on Monday to face probation violation charges her lawyer claimed the 18 year old turned up at her apartment claiming he had no place to stay. Defence lawyer David P. Hoose said given Lavoie’s psychological makeup and struggles with alcohol, the victim’s pleading with her fell 'on someone who will listen.' Likely story: The boy, now 18, was found hiding in Lavoie's closet; Lavoie claims he had nowhere else to go (stock photo) Lavoie caused outrage two years ago when it was revealed she had been having a sexual affair with the teen. She was a teacher at Maurice Donahue Elementary School and had met the 15 year old through friends. The pair's affair came to an end when they were tracked down by police to a Super Motel 8. FBI agents and US Border Patrol were involved in the search for the couple after they ran off. Lavoie pleaded guilty to rape and enticement of a child and was given five years’ probation instead of a prison sentence . Trial Judge Cornelius Moriarty defended the light sentence stating that he did not believe Lavoie was a sexual predator who was likely to reoffend. 'If I thought Lavoie was a manipulative sex offender likely to reoffend, my sentence would be very different,' he said. 'But I frankly do not believe that she is anything of the sort.' At her latest bond hearing Lavoie was offered a $25,000 cash bail. Her lawyers asked that she be allowed to live with her mother until her probation period has been completed.","Lisa Lavoie, 26, was on probation for having sex with 15-year-old student in 2009 .

Vladimir Putin faced a walkout by MPs today as he was addressing parliament in the latest sign of growing dissent against the strongman. It came the prime minister and president-elect, who  mockingly refused to intervene in a hunger strike by a politician over an allegedly rigged mayoral election in the southern city of Astrakhan. Dozens of MPs from the Just Russia opposition party left the chamber complaining of Putin's ‘rudeness’. Glowering: Russian Prime Minister and President-elect Vladimir Putin scowls after MPs walk out of the Duma . The scowling strongman: Despite the once unthinkable defiance by opposition MPs, Mr Putin continued to deliver an aggressive speech in which he also described Nato as a 'Cold War relic' The faction's mayoral candidate Oleg Shein has been on hunger strike for 27 days and there are concerns over his health. Two dozen supporters are also refusing to eat. They alleged Putin's party United Russia 'stole' the election by fiddling the ballots, an accusation that is denied. The walk-out - unthinkable until recently - came when president-elect Putin told MPs: ‘Your colleague Oleg Shein started the hunger strike but did not appeal to court. This is a bit strange. Why go on hunger strike?’ But Shein claims the authorities barred him obtaining key evidence to back his case in court. His supporters also claim the city is run by a ‘mafia system’ and the courts are biased. Putin also today called on Russians to have more children to halt a declining population. ‘For Russia every person counts today,’ Putin said. Empty seats: Just Russia party leader, Sergei Mironov, sits alone after the majority of his colleagues walked out . Focal point: Astrakhan mayoral candidate Oleg Shein, who has been on a hunger strike for 27 days . ‘A strong, happy family with several kids is what the state, society, religious, educational and cultural organisations should unite their efforts around. ‘We should realise that we will come face to face with a serious challenge - the demographic echo of the 1990s when Russia experienced its severest drop in birth rates. 'We need new decisive steps when it comes to saving and caring for people.’ And he called on Russians to cut down on cigarettes, vodka and illegal drug use. ‘Smoking, alcohol and drug abuse - without any wars or calamities - claim 500,000 lives of our countrymen every year,’ he warned. ‘This is simply a horrific figure.’ Chamber: Putin begins his speech to the Duma in which he also complained about Russia's falling birth rate . During his address, Putin also called NATO a relic of the Cold War but said he supported letting the alliance use a Russian airport as a supply hub in support of its mission in Afghanistan. Moscow is studying a request from the Western alliance for use of facilities at an airport in the Volga River city of Ulyanovsk as a transit point for shipments of non-lethal supplies to and from Afghanistan by air, rail and road. Russia has allowed Afghan-bound NATO transport through its territory since 2009 as an alternative to convoys through Pakistan, which have been subject to militant attacks, but no permanent facility was involved. ‘I consider NATO ... a throwback to the Cold War era. It was created at a time when there was a bipolar system of international relations,’ said Putin, who has frequently criticised the alliance and its eastward expansion. But, in his last address to parliament as prime minister before his return to the Kremlin next month, Putin dismissed fears that NATO's use of the Ulyanovsk facility could represent a threat in Russia's heartland. Crackdown: Interior Ministry officers detain a protester during a demonstration outside the Duma . Growing unrest: Russian opposition members with white ribbons form a human chain outside the parliament . ‘There will be no NATO base there,’ he said, but only ‘a hop over pad’ for military cargo transit. ‘Therefore I assure you that nothing unusual, not corresponding to our national interests, is happening there. On the contrary, everything that is being done in this sphere fully corresponds to the national interests of our people,’ he told parliament's lower house. In remarks that suggested Russia does not intend to decrease cooperation in Afghanistan, Putin said ‘in some cases NATO is playing the role of a stabiliser in global affairs’ and included the Afghan mission among such cases. The Soviet Union fought a disastrous war in Afghanistan and Russia ruled out sending troops to aid the U.S.-led invasion after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but Putin - president at the time - offered the use of Russian airspace and other support.","Once-unthinkable walkout came after MPs complained of his 'rudeness'

Exploring for gas using 'fracking' can continue safely even though it is likely to cause further earthquakes, a Government-commissioned report says. The technique of hydraulic fracturing is used to extract gas from shale rocks – potentially easing the country’s energy problems. Work was suspended a year ago by the firm Cuadrilla Resources following two small earthquakes at its site in Lancashire. Testing for gas: Cuadrilla Resources' shale drilling operation near Preston, Lancashire . While the report says these quakes - which measured 1.5 and 2.3 on the magnitude - were caused by the drilling, it concludes that further tremors would not be big enough to cause damage because they would not exceed three on the Richter Scale. Cuadrilla believes there could be 200 trillion cubic feet of  shale gas underneath the site – enough to meet Britain’s gas needs for the next 50 years. Even if the firm can extract only a fraction of it, it would still have an impact comparable to the exploitation of North Sea oil. Yesterday's report was rejected by anti-fracking campaigners who fear bigger earthquakes and the contamination of water supplies. Fracking involves pumping water, sand and chemicals into shale rock down a 9,000ft deep pipeline at high pressure to release gas. More... EXCLUSIVE: Cameron in humiliating u-turn on future of Britain's aircraft carriers with return of the jump jet . Tax relief chaos: Now Government orders a consultation as minister admits cap WILL hit charities hard . Cuadrilla hopes to establish at least 800 drilling wells on 80 sites in Lancashire. With a final decision on fracking to be made by the Department of Energy in six weeks, the report is seen as a crucial step toward what would be the biggest gas-drilling operation in Europe. Exploratory drilling licences have also been handed out in South Wales and Cheshire, with Sussex and Kent next in line. The report recommends one of the strictest monitoring regimes in the world. Any tremor over 0.5 in magnitude would trigger the removal of the fracking fluid while an investigation is held. The independent report was carried out by experts from Keele University and the British Geological Survey. They said magnitude 3 quakes were commonly caused by coal-mining and still take place regularly without impact. But they also recommended one of the strictest monitoring regimes in the world. Any . tremor greater than a tiny 0.5 magnitude would trigger the removal of . the fracking fluid – called ‘flowback’ - until it is investigated. The . report said this would be a ‘prudent threshold value’, to reduce the . likelihood of much bigger quakes. They will also try to use less . fracking fluid to limit the pressure building up underground. In . the USA where shale gas has been extracted for years, it has . transformed the energy landscape – making them an exporter of gas. Britain imports most of its gas from Norway and Qatar. A . final decision on fracking will be made by the Department of Energy and . Climate Change in six weeks, but the report is seen as a crucial step . towards what is set to be the biggest gas-drilling operation in Europe. Cuadrilla’s Chief Executive Mark . Miller said: ‘We are pleased that the experts have come to a clear . conclusion that it is safe to allow us to resume hydraulic fracturing, . following the procedures outlined in the review... we have already . started to implement a number of them in the pursuit of best practice’ The .

Wednesday: Steve Powell arrives in court on the day of opening arguments in his voyeurism trial today . A judge barred 'sexually graphic and obsessive' diary entries belonging to the father-in-law of missing Utah mother Susan Powell from being used at his trial, ruling they were irrelevant and would likely make jurors biased. It was the second victory in as many days for Steven Powell, accused of 14 counts of voyeurism, after the same judge ruled on Monday that a pornography charge against him should be dropped because the 2,000 images of his neighbor's children taking a bath did not prove he influenced the conduct of the subject of the pictures. Yesterday, Judge Ronald E. Culpepper said eight journal entries, in which Steven Powell discussed his obsession with his daughter-in-law Susan and sexual fantasies, were not admissible. 'This is all about stalking Susan,' Judge Culpepper said of one entry . Powell wrote about taking photos of his daughter-in-law in the driveway. Samples from the entries included phrases like: 'Susan likes to be admired and I'm a voyeur', 'I'm a voyeur and Susan is an exhibitionist' and 'I've been going nuts and nearly out of control sexually my entire life,' He did allow one entry to be used where Powell wrote: 'I enjoy taking video shots of pretty girls in shorts and skirts. I sometimes use these images for self stimulation.' Steven Craig Powell faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each of 14 counts against him. If convicted of all counts, he could face up to 70 years in prison. A jury of 12 men and women and two alternates were finally selected out of 70, who had to answer questions about whether or not they were biased or had formed an opinion on the high-profile case. Center of the debate: Steve Powell kept pictures of Susan breastfeeding and changing and diary entries detailing he watched her often . Excerpts from Powell's diary read aloud in court . Defense attorney Travis Currie argued yesterday the excerpts should not be used because it takes away from the voyeurism aspects of the trial and puts the focus on Susan Powell and her husband Josh, who killed himself and the couple's two sons in a . fiery explosion in February at a house in Graham. Many believed the murder suicide was an admission of guilt in his wife's disappearance but Chuck and Judy Cox have always maintained that Steven Powell had something to do with their daughter's disappearance. Josh Powell was the only named person of interest in the case but was never charged or arrested. He claimed he took his young sons, then four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am. When he came home, Susan was gone and he said she  had run off with another man. Authorities searched the desert for twelve days in the area where Josh Powell said he went camping that night. At one point, they said they found a 'shallow grave' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot. But they found no human remains. Concerned: Susan's parents, Judy and Chuck Cox, hope that Steven Powell 'slips' and reveals something about the 2009 disappearance of their daughter . Defense attorney: Travis Currie, left, talks to Steve Powell, yesterday after a judge dismissed a child pornography charge against Powell, the father-in-law of missing Utah mother Susan Powell . Defense attorneys argued that even the mention of Susan Powell's name would prejudice a jury as it has been such a high-profile case, culminating in the murder of her sons earlier this year. It also emerged that a recording of . Powell sexually gratifying himself while looking at pictures of Susan . was discovered along with thousands of pictures that focused on her . behind and taken while she was breastfeeding. Pierce . County prosecutors agreed about the risk of prejudice, but said the . passages were crucial to prove that Steve Powell recorded the images, . and that he did it for his sexual gratification. Other categories of digital files . included close-ups of women putting groceries in their cars and others . titled, 'DMV girl', 'Tacoma Mall', 'gum-chewing cutie', and 'young teen . volleyball player'. Opening statements in the trial are likely to begin on Wednesday, assuming a jury is selected by then. Center of the debate: Steve Powell (left) previously claimed that he and Susan (right) were a perfect match because he was a voyeur and she enjoyed being watched . Susan Powell's parents Chuck and Judy . Cox watched anxiously as Powell was led into the courtroom yesterday . wearing handcuffs, a tie and gray suit. While more than 60 potential jurors . filled out questionnaires in another room, prosecutors and defense . attorneys discussed how much should be disclosed at the trial about . Steve Powell's apparent obsession with his son's wife. If convicted of the remaining 14 . charges, he would face a guideline sentence of about four years but the . state has alleged aggravating circumstances that could result in a . longer term. The thousands of images found by . investigators reportedly show a decade’s worth of his work, but in this . specific case they are expected to focus on the ones relating to the . years 2006 and 2007. They volunteered to redact her name, and the judge and defense counsel agreed with the suggestion. Revelations: Charlie and Braden were beginning to speak more and more about their mother, saying she was 'in the trunk' and then that she disappeared . Tragedy: Powell blew up his Washington home, pictured, killing himself and the two young boys when they were dropped off for a supervised visit .

Two of NASA's biggest contractors are teaming up with a European agency to create a 'space taxi' for when astronauts need a quick lift away from this planet. Currently, NASA must 'catch a ride' from the Russian space agency when astronauts want to visit the International Space Station, following the retirement of the space shuttle last year. Exactly what fare Russia charges NASA for the 260-mile trip is unknown, but NASA will certainly want to be less reliant on another nation for space jaunts. So now NASA is funding space taxi research with four separate companies - Boeing, Space Exploration . Technologies, Sierra Nevada Corp, and Blue Origin, a startup owned by . Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. The Space Shuttle Enterprise, taking a quick trip through New York last month as it prepares for retirement at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York . NASA is reviewing bids for at least two design . contracts, valued at $300 million to $500 million apiece. The taxi service will be composed of recycled space shuttle parts along with a new NASA prototype spaceship. The contracts for NASA's so-called Commercial Crew program, is scheduled to be awarded this summer. ATK, which built the space shuttle booster rockets, teamed with Astrium, a company that is one of the manufacturers of Europe's Ariane 5 rockets, to bid for NASA space taxi development funds last year but was not selected. The company continued to work on the project with its own funding, said Kent Rominger, a five-time shuttle astronaut who now serves as an ATK vice president and Liberty program manager. ATK's new proposal adds a composite . seven-person capsule, a launch escape system, propulsion module, . avionics, an operations plan and other components for a complete space . launch system. Rominger . said Liberty could be ready to fly crew to the station in 2015 for less . than what Russia charges for rides in its Soyuz capsules. Rominger said: 'As a taxpayer, I want to get the best value out of what I've invested . into our government. For example, Ares 1 (rocket program) was canceled, . so to now pick up where the government left off is a very smart thing to . do. It brings us the best value as a nation.'

Taxi driver: This is the pilot's seat of the recently-retired Endeavour, as NASA looks around for a new company to get a lift from . The Liberty rocket's first stage would be an extended space shuttle booster rocket, a design originally developed under NASA's now-canceled Ares 1 rocket program. Liberty's second-stage engine would be provided by Astrium. The newly announced capsule, also named Liberty, is a composite spaceship developed by NASA as a potential alternative to the Orion deep-space capsule. Liberty would fly from one of the space shuttle launch pads at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Depending on funding, test flights could begin in 2014. Rominger said the capsules, which would parachute to a water landing, are designed to fly up to 10 times. In addition to carrying seven astronauts, the rocket and capsule could carry cargo to and from the space station, as well as be used for satellite launches and other missions. Rominger declined to say how much ATK and its partners have spent developing the Liberty system so far.","NASA needs a new service after retiring space shuttle last year .

Actor Alan Davies has faced a backlash from Liverpool fans over comments he made on a football podcast . Comedian Alan Davies today apologised again for his remarks about the  Hillsborough disaster - but added that his attackers 'do not speak for the dead.' Alan Davies came under fire for questioning Liverpool FC's refusal to play on the April 15 anniversary of the 1989 stadium disaster in which 96 football fans died. The 46-year-old comedian apologised for the 'insensitivity' of the comments, but insisted today the reaction he received from Liverpool fans went too far. Writing in The Times newspaper, Davies said he has been deemed worse than a serial rapist or paedophile by his critics, while others have sent him 'menacing warnings and threats to maim'. He said: 'To comprehend the viciousness of the response, I've tried to understand the desire to mourn for so long, and so publicly, the death of those fans. 'The Justice For The 96 campaign is ongoing, but the reality of bereavement is not reflected in the staging of memorial services each year. 'The reality of bereavement is that the loss of a loved one is with you all year round.' Critics had accused Davies of deliberately making the inflammatory comments to create 'free publicity' as he prepares to go on tour for the first time in 12 years. Davies said sorry for the remarks, but last week aggravated the situation by joking on Twitter about disguising himself in a stereotypically 'Scouse' costume inspired by Harry Enfield. After receiving a barrage of abuse and death threats on Twitter for the comments he made about Hillsborough on Tuesday, he wrote yesterday: ‘Going out later. I’ve decided to get a disguise.’ He then posted a link to a fancy dress costume of a ‘comedy Scouser’ including a 1980s shell suit, permed wig and bushy moustache. Jonathan Creek and QI star Davies, an Arsenal supporter from Essex, went on to describe the abusive messages he has received as 'alarming'. Tragedy: Ninety six Liverpool fans lost their lives on that fateful day in 1989 in the Hillsborough disaster . An injured fan being carried off the pitch after overcrowding led to the death of 96 supporters . He added: 'There is a loss of perspective and a distortion of genuine emotion over Hillsborough. 'Those attacking me with such hatred don't speak on behalf of the dead and should be ashamed to claim that they do. 'At no point did I ""mock the dead"", as I am accused. What I have been subjected to is alarming. Vile and hateful messages by the hundred. Death threats to me, my wife and my children. 'Menacing warnings and threats to maim. I am worse than a serial rapist, than a paedophile. And some people are rejoicing that my mother is dead. 'It's difficult to contemplate anything I could say on any subject to generate a similar furore.' Never forget: Speakers defended their right for the club not to play on the anniversary of the tragedy . Campaign: Fans chanted to justice for those who died, with guests speakers also calling for full disclosure . Liverpool united: The first-team squad joined 1000s of fans inside Anfield to remember the 96 victims of the Hillsborough tragedy, which happened 23 years ago on Sunday . Davies said that among the abuse he received after making the Hillsborough comments, he was contacted by people who said they 'want to urinate on my mother's grave', and 'who would take pleasure in seeing my wife sexually assaulted.' Meanwhile at the annual memorial service at Anfield to mark the anniversary of Hillsborough, a guest speaker used the platform to hit out against the recent comments by Davies. In a speech at the service, Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, addressed Davies' assertion that the club should be made to play on April 15. She said: 'When certain people made certain comments about Liverpool Football Club should be playing on the 15th of April, I am afraid that person wants to learn to keep his comments to himself and his opinions to himself. 'Because when comments like that offend and hurt so many thousands of people it's quite obvious he has got nothing else to worry about in his life as what we have had for 23 years.' Her criticism was greeted with loud cheers and applause. Following the furore that greeted the remarks on his weekly football podcast, Davies made a £1,000 donation to the campaign group - which it refused - and apologised for the tone.","TV personality apologises for insensitivity in tone' of comments, but says reaction went too far .

"UPDATED: . 09:46 EST, 7 December 2011 . The storm around the 'Carrier IQ' software used in US mobile phones has led US Senators to question the company, lawsuits, and questions over how many handsets carry the monitoring software - and what exactly it does . Spyware researcher Trevor Eckhart showed off a video this week demonstrating that 'Carrier IQ' - software buried deep within the operating systems of American mobiles to provide mobile carriers with information - might be snooping a little more than it should. Eckhart's demonstration showed the software 'reading' the contents of text messages and web browsing on an HTC Android phone, and transmitting the information. Since then, handset makers such as RIM, Nokia and Apple have rushed to distance themselves from the software - portraying the 'spyware' as an Android-only problem. Eckhart's demo used an HTC phone (pictured). Since then, US Senator Al Franken has asked the software company to respond to Eckhart's claim - and an Illinois resident has filed a lawsuit against the company. Illinois Erin Janek filed a lawsuit against Carrier IQ and handset maker HTC - which Eckhart used for his demonstration - alleging illegal interception of information. Eckhart's demo showed that the software, which is supposed to provide mobile phone networks with information on how handsets are used, 'read' and transmitted the contents of SMS messages, and also monitored web browsing. Carrier IQ - whose software is used on millions of handsets across the US - released a statement. 'While a few individuals have identified that there is a great deal of information available to the Carrier IQ software inside the handset, our software does not record, store or transmit the contents of SMS messages, email, photographs, audio or video,' the company said. 'For example, we understand whether an SMS was sent accurately, but do not record or transmit the content of the SMS. We know which applications are draining your battery, but do not capture the screen.' It's still unclear whether the application does 'log' keystrokes - or, if so, how this data is used. Handset makers rushed to distance themselves from the software, which is installed by phone networks to monitor usage. Research In Motion RIM does not install, nor authorize, its carrier partners to install “Carrier IQ” monitoring software on its BlackBerry smartphones, the company said on Thursday. RIM made the statement after a security researcher said the 'Carrier IQ' application, which can monitor what device users are doing, has been installed on mobile devices from multiple vendors without the knowledge or consent of customers. Trevor Eckhart, the researcher who demonstrated in online videos how the software works, focused on devices using Google’s GOOG.O Android operating system, but he also mentioned other operating systems, including RIM’s BlackBerry and Nokia’s NOK1V.HE Symbian system as having the software installed. Nokia also denied their phones used the software. Handset makers such as Nokia, makers of the Lumia (pictured), said that Carrier IQ software was not installed on their handsets . 'CarrierIQ does not ship products for any Nokia devices,' a company spokesman said. U.S. Senator Al Franken asked software maker Carrier IQ to respond to claims by an independent security researcher that its products collect and transmit potentially sensitive data about millions of mobile phone users. The video shows a piece of software tracking Eckhart as he turns his phone on and off, punches numbers to make a call and records text message in plain text. 'The revelation that the locations and other sensitive data of millions of Americans are being secretly recorded and possibly transmitted is deeply troubling,' Franken said in a statement. 'Carrier IQ has a lot of questions to answer.' In his letter, he asked the company for details on the types of data its software collects and what it does with that information. AT&T and Sprint Nextel both said they use the software in their devices to collect information that helps them improve network and service performance. 'We do use carrier IQ, but we do not and cannot look at the contents of messages, etc., as some have speculated,” said Sprint spokeswoman Stephanie Vinge-Walsh. Apple Inc said that some devices, including iPhones, that run on its iOS 4 operating system use the Carrier IQ software, but that it does not work with the newer iOS 5. In a statement posted to its website last month, Carrier IQ said its software is used by network operators to help improve network quality and troubleshoot device problems. “While we look at many aspects of a device’s performance, we are counting and summarizing performance, not recording keystrokes, or providing tracking tools,” the Mountain View, California-based company said. Since Eckhart’s videos first appeared, a firestorm of criticism has erupted in online forums and on Twitter, where users complain about breach of privacy. Carrier IQ immediately tried to suppress Eckhart's report. The . Electronic Freedom Foundation, an activist group which promotes free . speech online, said, 'Carrier IQ fired off a cease-and-desist letter to . Eckhart, claiming that he infringed its copyrights and made unspecified . false allegations about its software.","U.S. senator asks company to clarify 'deeply troubling' allegations .

A wealthy British businessman and his wife have been found dead at their retreat in a remote Estonian forest. Philip Townsend, 55, worked for a mysterious Moscow investment company, where he was an analyst in the lucrative but murky Russian telecoms industry. Mr Townsend – who used the title Baron Townsend of Rathmore – and his British wife MaryAnne, 52, are believed to have been poisoned by carbon monoxide from an electricity generator at their secluded home. Police in Estonia released no details of the tragedy until contacted by The Mail on Sunday, and say they do not yet know whether the deaths are suspicious. Mr Townsend, who also owned a 16th Century manor house in Norfolk and a flat in Kensington, London, has been research director of Moscow-based Enza Capital since 2010. Four years ago another wealthy British-based tycoon involved in the Russian telecoms industry vanished from his opulent holiday villa in Latvia. Leonid Rozhetskin, 41, is presumed to have been targeted by an assassin. But last night the Townsend  family said they believed this latest  incident – which leaves the couple’s two children, Edmund, 17, and  Octavia, 15, orphaned – to be a ‘tragic accident’. Mr Townsend, who previously worked in London, is said to have typically spent the week in Moscow before returning home to Grade II listed Wood Dalling Hall, near  Aylsham, Norfolk, at weekends. He died in a converted barn, which he is thought to have bought and renovated last year. The house is three miles down a dirt track near the town of Valga in southern Estonia. Their only neighbour for miles, farmer Rein Rappo, 70, said he collected Mr Townsend from the Russian border on February 22  and drove him to the house. Mrs Townsend flew in from England the next day. Mr Rappo said: ‘On the evening of February 23 they were visited by a friend. I believe it was the man who built the house. I woke up at 4.30am and noticed their lights were still on. ‘At 10am a workman arrived at their house and he found their bodies. He ran over to my house and told me what he had found. He had seen Mrs Townsend’s body near the front door. Mr Townsend’s body was by the electricity generator.’ Secluded: Mr Townsend's secluded Estonian barn conversion, where he and his wife were discovered dead . When The Mail on Sunday visited the house daffodils and pink tulips had been left at the front door. The lounge, visible through the front window, appeared to have been left exactly as it was when they died. On the dining table was a half-empty bottle of red wine and two glasses, one half full, one empty. Also on the table was a pair of reading glasses, a handbag, a pair of leather gloves, a compass, a cigarette lighter and a book entitled Estonia: Cultural Tourism. A spokeswoman at Enza Capital declined to comment, saying: ‘We are not authorised to speak about his death.’ She also declined to give any information on the company. A source at Renaissance Capital, a respected investment company in Moscow, said: ‘None of my colleagues has ever heard of Enza Capital. We have no idea what this company is doing.’ Wealthy: Wood Dalling Hall, Wood Dalling, Norfolk, the 16th century home of Philip and MaryAnne Townsend . An Estonian police spokesman said the bodies were being examined by forensics experts and added: ‘No conclusion has been reached. There is no criminal investigation at this time. We are waiting for the post-mortem results. ‘If there is any evidence of foul play, we will investigate. Investigations at the scene show the building used an electricity generator, which was leaking gas. When officers arrived at the scene, they found the house filled with carbon monoxide.’ Mrs Townsend’s brother James Wilson, 49, a Norfolk farmer, said: ‘The children will be looked after by their relatives in Norfolk. The family request respect to be left alone to mourn this sad family tragedy.’ Additional reporting: Andrew Young .","Police they do not yet know if deaths are suspicious .

A German doctor has been sentenced to . 15 years in prison for killing his teenage stepdaughter after he was . kidnapped and smuggled into France to face justice. Dieter . Krombach, 76, was found guilty by a French court on Saturday for . unintentionally killing Kalinka Bamberski in Bavaria in 1982. It . followed a three-week trial which only came about after the victim's . natural father, Andre Bamberski, hired a team of Russian kidnappers to . take Krombach from Germany to France to face a court. The bizarre case has divided French and German investigators. In 1995, Krombach, a cardiologist, was found guilty of manslaughter by a French court in absentia while living in Bavaria. German . investigators had ruled in 1987 that there was insufficient evidence to . charge Krombach and extradition to France was refused. Krombach thought he would be safe in his home in Germany. But . Mr Bamberski, 74, waged a relentless campaign to bring the ageing . suspect before a French court and went to extreme lengths by hiring a . team of professional Russian kidnappers. Two years ago the medic was bundled into the back of a blacked-out limousine car, bound and gagged, and driven to France. After . being hauled out of the back of a limousine by the Russian kidnappers, . Mr Krombach was found tied and gagged next to a court building in . Mulhouse, the French city on the German border. French law allowed him to be retried before a judge. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Bamberski told how he was delighted with the verdict. 'My . first thought is for Kalinka,' he said. 'What I promised her, what I . wanted was a complete and fair trial. Now that goal has been reached. Justice has been done in her memory and now I will be able to mourn for . her.'

Facing charges: Andre Bamberski, second left, father of Kalinka Bamberski, speaks to the media during the trial of German doctor Dieter Krombach. He hired professional kidnappers to take Krombach to France to face justice . Mr Bamberski, who is French, now faces kidnapping charges for Krombach's abduction. The . retired accountant has admitted organising the abduction of his . daughter's killer but denies paying any money to abductors. He says it . was justified because Krombach would otherwise have escaped justice. His daughter died in 1982 aged 14 while on holiday with her mother near Lake Constance in southern Germany. Prosecution . counsel Pierre Kramer said Krombach raped the French teenager after . drugging her, inadvertently causing her death when she suffocated in her . sleep. Krombach claimed he had given her an iron injection to help improve her suntan. Denial: Dieter Krombach, left, has always insisted he was innocent of attacking his stepdaughter Kalinka Bamberski . An initial autopsy report pointed to signs of injury to her genitals, but subsequent tests were rendered inconclusive. Suspicious white and red fluids were also found on Kalinka's underwear and legs. According . to the Daily Telegraph, Kalinka's mother Danielle Gonnin, told the . court that she had found her daughter lifeless in bed. 'I . immediately thought of the injection, but Dieter Krombach told me: ""No, . there's never been any problem with these injections.' The court in Paris said on Saturday that Krombach was guilty of 'wilful violence leading to death without intent'. In . 1997 - in a completely separate case - he was convicted of drugging and . raping a 16-year-old patient and received a two-year suspended prison . sentence.

Pain: Rock fan Robert McIndoe killed himself after getting unbearable tinnitus from a rock concert . A heavy metal fan died after stabbing himself because of the debilitating tinnitus he developed from a rock concert, an inquest heard today. Father-of-two Robert McIndoe, 52, battled to get treatment for the ringing in his ears as his life became a living hell for three months after he went to watch Grammy award winning ‘supergroup’ Them Crooked Vultures featuring Nirvana’s Dave Grohl, Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones and Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age. The ringing noise left Mr McIndoe unable to sleep, considering making himself deaf, and wishing he was dead - but several times he was turned away by doctors who failed to communicate, assess him properly or realise the extent of his desperation, Southwark Coroner’s Court was told. Southwark Coroner Dr Andrew Harris recorded an open verdict after he said he could not be sure he intended to take his own life, but he added: 'There clearly were failings in his care. 'The fact that this man repeatedly requested referrals and walked across London from hospital to hospital, paid for private consultation, was seen by the ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist and a clinical psychologist, but had not started three months after damage to his ears is a shameful reflection professional communication and access to services in the NHS.' Amateur actor Mr McIndoe had been to see Them Crooked Vultures at Brixton Academy in south London last July and woke up with ringing in his ears. Dr Harris added: 'He had been exposed to loud music in the past, but this time the tinnitus occurred and persisted.' Mr McIndoe, a management consultant and a keen guitarist, visited his GP surgery three times for his 'unremitting tinnitus' and was referred to see an ear, nose and throat specialist at King’s College Hospital in south London, the hearing was told. However, there were no specialists available and he was sent to St Thomas’s Hospital in south London instead where he was turned away before getting an urgent appointment at the Royal London. Less than a fortnight before his death he attended A&E at Lewisham Hospital where he was given sleeping tablets and a doctor promised to fax his GP the following day to arrange for an appointment. But when he visited the GP no and note had arrived, he told him he was 'feeling suicidal due to the tinnitus adversely affecting his life and his marriage.' Heavy metal: John Paul Jones, Dave Grohl and Josh Homme of Them Crooked Vultures perform rock songs. A similar show gave Mr McIndoe such bad tinnitus he killed himself . Noise: Former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl bangs loud drums during a show. The band are well-known in the world of heavy-metal . Mr McIndoe's wife Shirley McIndoe said: 'He was desperate that it was never going to change - he didn’t know if he could live like this.' The day after the appointment, on October 19th, 2010, Mr McIndoe left a suicide note and took an overdose at the family home in Sydenham, south-east London but the attempt to kill himself failed and he was hospitalised. He told a psychiatrist he would rather be 'deaf of dead'. Dr Harris said: 'He said that what he wanted most of all was to go to sleep and not wake up, he wanted to die to stop the sound of the tinnitus.' Mr McIndoe was released on October 22nd, 2010, and had seemed more positive, wanting treatment, but seven days later on October 29th he stabbed himself several times. A family member who he had text to say 'remember old friends, think carefully before making decisions, and always think of the consequences' had gone to check on him when they found his naked bloodied body. He never started his combined ENT and cognitive behavioural therapy. Derek Nicoll, head of clinical pathways at South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, admitted that there had been problems in the care - particularly in supervision and communication between the different agencies who treated him. He said that audits of the service and new procedures had been put in place to ensure that the failures never occurred again. The inquest heard that Mr McIndoe had also tried alternative therapies, including acupuncture, and even considered permanently deafening himself by having his auditory nerve cut. Conor Dufficy, representing the family of the amateur actor, suggested that the coroner should find there had been neglect. Mr Dufficy said: 'He had been suffering for some time from tinnitus and severe depression and overall the care and communication he received from various mental health bodies involved failed him and therefore may have contributed to his death.' However, Dr Harris said that there was no evidence the failings caused his death and as the failings were individual and had been addressed he could make no recommendations for change.","Robert McIndoe considered making himself deaf to escape the constant ringing noise .

"By . Damien Gayle . UPDATED: . 09:40 EST, 7 March 2012 . Reversal: Afghan president Hamid Karzai has backed a strict code of conduct for women in the country . Activists have accused the Afghan president of reversing improvements in women's rights after he endorsed a strict 'code of conduct' issued by clerics. Hamid Karzai yesterday backed a document issued by the Ullema Council which promotes segregation of the sexes and allows husbands to beat wives in certain circumstances. The move is seen as part of his attempts to reach out to the Taliban in the lead up to the planned withdrawal of Nato troops from the Afghanistan in 2014. But activists are furious that gains made in women's rights since the 2001 invasion and ensuing occupation are being used as a bargaining chip with Islamic extremists. Prior to the 2001 U.S. invasion, girls were banned from going to school and women forced to wear burkas to conceal them from head to toe. Women were also banned from venturing from their homes being escorted by a male relative. Similarly, the new 'code of conduct' says women should not travel without a male companion and they should not mingle with men in places like schools, markets or offices. Wife-beating is only prohibited if there is no 'Shariah-compliant reason', it said. Mr Karzai insisted the document was in keeping with Islam and did not restrict women. 'It is the Shariah law of all Muslims and all Afghans,' he added. Unveiled: Young Afghan women in traditional clothing participate in a teachers graduation ceremony in March last year . Women's activists say the Afghan . president's endorsement of the code seems to imply that laws aimed at . protecting women's rights may be sacrificed for peace negotiations. Heather . Barr, an Afghanistan researcher for New York-based Human Rights Watch, . said: 'It sends a really frightening message that women can expect to . get sold out in this process.' Rights: A woman with an ink-stained finger holds her ID card as she waits to vote in presidential elections at a Kabul polling station in 2009 . Shukria Barikzai, a parliamentarian . from the capital Kabul, who has been active in women's issues, said she . was worried that Mr Karzai and the clerics' council appeared to be . ignoring their country's own laws. 'When it comes to civil rights in . Afghanistan, Karzai should respect the constitution,' Ms Barikzai said. The Afghan constitution provides equal rights for men and women. The exception for certain types of beatings also appears to contradict Afghan law that prohibits spousal abuse. The guidelines also promote rules on divorce that give women few rights, a U-turn from pledges by Mr Karzai to reform Afghan family law to make divorces more equitable, Ms Barr said. 'This represents a significant change in his message on women's rights,' she said. Afghan women's rights activist Fatana Ishaq Gailani, founder of the Afghanistan Women's Council, said she feels like women's rights are being used as part of a political game. 'We want the correct Islam, not the Islam of politics,' Ms Gailani said. She said she supported negotiations with the Taliban, but that Afghanistan's women should not be sacrificed for that end. Restrictions: Afghan women pictured in 2001 wearing the burka. Activists worry advances in women's rights could be bargained away by the government . Hadi Marifat of the Afghanistan Human Rights and Democracy Organisation, which surveyed 5,000 Afghan women for a recent report on the state of women's rights in Afghanistan, said the statements show Mr Karzai is shifting toward the strictest interpretations of Shariah law. 'In the post-Taliban Afghanistan, the guiding principle of president Karzai regarding women's rights has been attracting funding from the international community on one hand, balanced against the need to get the support of the Ullema Council and other traditionalists on the other,' Ms Marifat said. 'The concerning thing is that now this balance is shifting toward the conservative element, and that was obvious in his statement.'","Activists worried women's rights being used as bargaining chip in negotiations with the Taliban .

A 13-year-old girl was stabbed, beaten and strangled before her body was dumped in a baseball dugout, it emerged today. Jessica Funk-Haslam was found by a passer-by at the Rosemont Community Park in Sacramento on Tuesday. She had suffered blunt force trauma to her head, a stab wound and was asphyxiated, according to a coroner's report. Jessica, an eighth-grader at nearby Albert Einstein Middle School, was last seen around 5.30pm the previous evening when she left her home to meet someone following an argument with her mother. She was still wearing the zebra-striped jacket she went out in when she was discovered. According to one witness, two people were seen near the park between 11pm and 12.30am on the night she disappeared. They had parked a vehicle in a parking lot near Jessica's school and then sat on bleachers nearby, according to www.news10.net. Another witness, Justin Gray, who lives near Rosemont Park, says he heard a male and a young girl talking there at around 2.30am on Tuesday morning, but couldn't make out anyone in the dark. A teenage boy who had been dating Jessica said she had been hanging out with the wrong crowd and skipped school. Scroll down for video .

Jessica's mother, Tara Funk-Haslam, believes her daughter's death may have involved 'at least one girlfriend.' 'She was wanting to go out and see somebody. She wouldn’t tell me who,' she told CBS13. 'I had tried to keep her home too much. I didn’t want her to go out at night.' She had some 'strong ideas' about her daughter's demise, but didn't want to speculate, she added.

This Sunday marks the 19th year since Stephen Lawrence was brutally knifed to death by a group of racist white youths on a patch of pavement in Eltham, south London. It will also be the 13th year that his mother Doreen, 59, has spent alone, trying to come to terms the traumatic event which changed the course of her life. She had been married for 28 years, but six years after Stephen's stabbing on April 22 1993, her relationship with Neville broke down and she now describes herself as being in 'a lonely place.' Isolated: Doreen Lawrence has spent more than 13 years alone, trying to come to terms with her son's death . This year on January 3, the Lawrences gained some form of closure as two of Stephen's killers, Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, were sentenced for murder - described by Mr Justice Treacy as ‘a terrible and . evil crime’. Because both defendants were 17 and 16 at the time of the attack, they . were sentenced as juveniles, Dobson was told he would serve at least 15 years and two months while David Norris was given a minimum of 14 years. Had they been sentenced as adults, the judge said they would . have received a minimum tariff of 30 years. But Doreen says after 18 years of living in limbo, awaiting some kind of justice, she still remains 'shell-shocked', and her health has suffered as a consequence. 'I haven't been well since the verdict: my body's been racked with pains, a physical manifestation of grief. 'I spend a lot of time on my own, living with the memories of what happened. It's a lonely place. I wouldn't wish it on anyone,' she told Grazia magazine. Doreen and Neville Lawrence in 1993, after Stephen's murder. They divorced after the heartbreak of the murder . Memorial: The black marble plaque which marks the spot where Stephen Lawrence died in Eltham, in 1993 . Doreen has also chronicled the disintegration of their relationship in painful detail in her memoir, And Still I Rise. She . described how she left Neville for four days on their first Christmas . without Stephen because his behaviour was so intolerable; how they . argued bitterly over his remoteness on a trip to Jamaica to lay a . headstone on Stephen's grave. Stephen as a teenager with his life ahead of him. It was cruelly cut short when he was murdered . And she told how he would later drift . away from his family for months at a time to stay with relatives on the . island, or in Florida, leaving her to face the inquest and continue the . work of the Stephen Lawrence Trust alone. The pair divorced in 1999 and Neville now lives in Jamaica. Neville previously told Daily Mail writer . David Jones: ‘When Stephen was murdered, Doreen and me had been married . for more than 20 years. Things might not always have been perfect . between us, but we had a normal, loving relationship. ‘But our world began falling apart . from the moment the hospital staff told us our son had died. For some . reason that I’ve tried to understand - and I still don’t - we couldn’t . reach out to one another. ‘We . stayed together for another six years, but from that day we never . physically touched one another again. We didn’t cuddle or hold hands for . comfort, as you might expect a couple to do. ‘We would sleep in the same bed, but we lay side-by-side like statues. ‘It . took those boys ten seconds to murder Stephen. In those ten seconds . they wrecked four other lives, too: mine, Doreen’s, and Stuart and . Georgina’s (his other children, now 34 and 29 respectively).’ While her marriage fell apart, Doreen focused her efforts on helping her two other children Georgina and Stuart cope with the death of their brother, and fighting for justice. Doreen regards as her proudest achievement the setting up of the Stephen . Lawrence Charitable Trust, which provides bursaries for youngsters from . ethnic minorities to pursue their educational ambitions. Awarded an OBE in 2003 in recognition of her work, she says she will . continue fighting to give young men like Stephen all the opportunities . he was denied and her reputation for being a tough campaigner has won her . places on various boards advising government policy makers and senior . police officers on race relations. This Sunday, Doreen will visit the exact spot where Stephen died, now marked with a black marble memorial plaque - something she likes to think of as a grave stone as Stephen is buried in Jamaica at a remote location in the rural highlands next to his great-grandmother. Doreen Lawrence has made this pilgrimage every year since 1993 to lay flowers and talk to her son. She added: 'I suppose, against such a background, that what happened with Neville, Stephen's dad, was inevitable. 'Something had to give.'

"Incident occurred when crowd mobbed Lohan's car . She slams 'false accusations as absurd' on Twitter . Lindsay 'called police herself for protection' Police: 'There was no evidence of a crime or a hit and run' But alleged victim is said to be planning to file a report . Hit and run investigation would violate Lohan's probation . By . Amelia Proud . PUBLISHED: . 09:11 EST, 14 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:20 EST, 14 March 2012 . Just as it seemed as though Lindsay Lohan was turning a corner, disaster seems to have struck again. Quite literally, too, as the 25-year-old allegedly struck someone while driving away from a club, and then fled the scene, according to TMZ. And despite an initial police investigation concluding that nobody had been injured and they were therefore happy to close the case, it seems that the man 'struck' by Lindsay is to press charges. Melee: Lindsay Lohan tries to drive her Porsche away from the Sayers Club in Hollywood late last night, she's alleged to have 'slightly struck' a club manager in the crowd . The actress herself took to Twitter and her WhoSay account to slam the rumours, and wrote: 'Scrape? This is all a complete lie. I've . been at community service. Last night, I attempted to wish a friend . happy birthday, which I didn't even get to do because I was freaked out . by all of the paparazzi. These false accusations are absurd.' TMZ report that the club manager who was hit has sought medical attention and is looking to hire a lawyer. If he does file a complaint, police will have no choice but to open a hit-and-run investigation, which would violate Lindsay's probation in her shoplifting case. Lindsay was in her new Porsche when she left the Sayers Club in Hollywood at just after midnight Wednesday. TMZ contend that LIndsay was driving out of the . parking area when she was blocked by paparazzi and bystanders around the . nearby Hookah Lounge. They wrote: 'Lindsay made contact with the manager of the Hookah Lounge with her car and then peeled out. Police assistance: Lindsay and her friend were later pulled over by the police, but it's believed that Lohan called them to come to her aid . Denial: Lindsay Came out fighting on both her Twitter and WhoSay account . 'Cops were called, came to the scene, . interviewed people inside the Hookah Lounge -- including the manager who . was lightly struck -- and then left. 'We're told Lindsay may have been the one who called police to protect herself from paparazzi, and that's why cops came.' They add that the manager didn't know who Lindsay was at first and that he told photographers on scene that he was fine, but that a short time later he started complaining he was injured. The 26-year-olf 'grazed his knee' with her vehicle and only began complaining about his injury after he discovered the driver's celebrity, it is alleged. One eyewitness told TMZ: 'He got up and started smoking his hookah.' In hot water again: Lindsay Lohan in Beverly Hills last night before she headed to the Sayers Club in Hollywood where she's alleged to have struck a man with her car . A police spokesperson told RadarOnline.com: 'There was no evidence of a crime or a hit and run.' But Lindsay did swap seats with her friend after the incident, she was pictured leaving in the driving seat but when she was pulled over by police - her friend was driving. The night before this debacle her $80,000 sports car was photographed with a extensive scrape across the side. This was BEFORE the Sayers Club incident last night, as she enjoyed dinner at a Japanese restaurant in Beverly Hills on Tuesday night. Lindsay was pictured leaving the meal in her very battered-looking luxury vehicle. The six-month-old black Porsche Panamera had suffered enormous scrape marks along its side. The eye of the storm: The cavalcade of fans and photographers around Lindsay is said to have caused the later incident . Lindsay had been dining out at Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ Restaurant in Beverly Hills with her sister Ali Lohan, 18, and friends. She dressed up for the occasion, in a blue frilly top, black skinny jeans, blue heels and a brown 'waterfall' jacket. The Mean Girls star has recently returned to her natural red tresses after sporting a platinum 'do for several months. In a scrap: The actress' new Porsche had a nasty scrape along the side . Ali, 18, also had a recent makeover with a short, choppy cut to her previously long mane. Ali wore ripped jeans, a black jacket and ankle boots. Lindsay splashed on her latest toy in October last year. The purchase set her back $80,000 - despite her being sued for $90,000 in unpaid limo fees at the same time. Despite being panned by critics, Lohan's recent stint as a Saturday Night Live host proved a ratings winner, becoming the second-most watched episode of the season. Sisters night out: Lindsay was joined by sister Ali for the dinner . On a personal front, things are also improving: She is set to finish her community service assignment, which she was handed after pleading guilty in May last year to stealing a necklace from jewelry store in Venice, California. Lindsay also served five weeks of home confinement last summer for misdemeanor theft and violation of another probation. She has predicted she will finish her community service at Los Angeles County morgue and her counseling requirements well ahead of her March 29 deadline. A spokesman for Lindsay declined to comment at this time.

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 08:08 EST, 9 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:14 EST, 9 March 2012 . Police will pay out a five-figure sum to the grieving family of Fiona Pilkington who killed herself and her disabled daughter after a decade of unchecked abuse by yobs. Officers failed to protect the mother who turned her car into a fireball while she and 18-year-old Francecca Hardwick, who had severe learning difficulties, sat inside. The pair, who were repeatedly targeted by gangs of youths, were found in a layby in October 2007 a couple of miles from their home in Barwell, Leicestershire. Ignored: Fiona Pilkington killed herself and her disabled daughter Francesca, 18, after a gang taunted them for ten years . An inquest into their deaths two years later heard police were contacted 33 times in 10 years about anti-social behaviour - but the family only received eight visits from officers. A jury returned verdicts of suicide and unlawful killing, and said the response of Leicestershire Police and two local councils had contributed to what happened. A claim for damages against the force on behalf of Ms Pilkington's son, Anthony, 21, who has learning difficulties, and her mother, Pam Cassell, 74, was lodged at the High Court last year. It sought damages of between £15,000 and £50,000, and alleged there was a 'substantial chance' Ms Pilkington and her daughter would not have died if officers had taken decisive action. The papers stated: 'Fiona Pilkington was driven to take this tragic action by the stress and anxiety she was suffering as a result of on-going anti-social behaviour, harassment, victimisation and bullying.' Leicestershire Police tried to have the application dismissed, arguing its officers could not have foreseen that Ms Pilkington would kill herself and her daughter. The bodies of Fiona Pilkington, 38, and her daughter Francesca Hardwick, 18, were discovered in a burnt out car . But the force has now settled the claim with what is believed to be a five-figure sum, although it stopped short of admitting liability. The family's solicitor, Jocelyn Cockburn, said: 'It was important for the family to achieve justice after going through a horrendous few years following the deaths of Fiona Pilkington and Francecca and it has given them a modicum of financial security going forward. 'The case also had enormous public interest because of public concern about the treatment of vulnerable and disabled people in society, and the case dealt with what duties the police have to protect people like Fiona and her family from anti-social behaviour and hate crime.' Ms Pilkington was driven to taking her own life and the life of her daughter Francecca after being bullied by a teenage gang in Barwell. This was their house . The family's claim stated that as a result of the alleged breaches by Leicestershire Police, they suffered 'a very real loss of very close and loved family members and resulting grief and bereavement'. It contained details of dozens of incidents reported by the family between 1997 and 2007. It added: 'Over the entire period there were numerous occasions on which Fiona and Francecca did not leave their home as Fiona was so anxious about the abuse and anti-social behaviour they would otherwise suffer.' Leicestershire Police were accused of failing in their duty, under Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights, to have suitable systems in place for investigating, controlling and suppressing harassment of members of the public - in particular vulnerable ones - and for managing the effects of such harassment on them. Following an IPCC probe, four Leicestershire Police officers faced misconduct charges. But they were cleared after a series of internal hearings. An IPCC report also found that the force had failed to identify Ms Pilkington and her daughter as vulnerable. Speaking after its hearings, Dave Evans, Deputy Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police, said the failings were of 'an organisational nature due to the systems and processes in place at the time'. Speaking after today's announcement, Leicestershire Police Chief Constable Simon Cole said: 'I can confirm that the civil claim has been settled out of court – this has been done without admission of liability. 'This is a tragic case and I felt that it was the right thing to do to, for everyone concerned, to draw a line under the litigation. 'Since the sad events in October 2007 the force has made significant changes to the way anti-social behaviour is dealt with and the way in which vulnerability is identified to ensure that the right support is given.'","Leicestershire Police will pay but haven't admitted liability .

The wife of a respected Oklahoma fire chief laughed at police as they collected gunpowder residue after she allegedly shot her husband in the back of the head in September. At Rebecca Bryan's murder trial Wednesday, her best friend testified that on the way to the hospital to see her dying husband, the 52-year-old mother of two showed off a picture of another man's penis and said she had sex with him earlier in the day. Bryan claims a hooded man with a vendetta against her husband Keith, the chief of the Nichols Hill Fire Department, walked into the living room of their Mustang, Oklahoma, home and shot him as he watched television September 20. Cold-blooded: Prosecutors say Rebecca Bryan shot her husband in the back of the head at point-blank range as he sat watching television . However, prosecutors say Bryan is a cold-blooded killer who cheated on her spouse with at least two other men and seemed to show little remorse after putting a bullet in the back of his head at nearly point-blank range. On the car ride to the hospital, Bryan's friend Debbie Proctor said, Bryan also revealed a text message to her former lover that talked about her inheriting a large amount of money and moving to another part of the state. The lover, Mark Holbrook, said she called him three hours before the shooting -- the first time they had talked in seven months.

Happier times: Rebecca Bryan pins a medal on Keith, her husband of 33 years, who was a respected fire chief in Oklahoma . Vendetta: Rebecca Bryan said a hooded man with a grudge against Keith stormed into their house and shot him . They began sleeping together in December 2009, but Mr Holbrook said he broke it off with her about a month later after she became manipulative. 'I began to realize she wasn't the person I thought she was,' he said, according to the Oklahoman. That's when he came forward and confessed to Keith Bryan that he had been sleeping with his wife. For a man who had just been cheated on, Mr Holbrook said, Keith took it remarkably well. He was understanding and never got angry. Rebecca, on the other hand, was angry. She called Mr Holbrook's wife, his parents and his son, he testified. A month after the affair ended, Mr Holbrook said Bryan called him and claimed she was pregnant. He never returned the call. Police officers testified that Bryan took off her shirt and show them her breasts when they told her they needed to take her clothes for evidence. Despite Bryan's story of an intruder, police discovered the murder weapon, a small Ruger LCP pistol, in the dryer at the couple's home. They also found ammunition for the gun under Bryan's side of the bed and a spent round from the gun in the living room where Keith Bryan was shot. A local police officer told the court he arrived at the house after Rebecca Bryan called 911 and found her in the garage. Rather than directing her to her husband inside the house, she instead began talking to him about a previous burglary case. When the officer told Rebecca to tell him about the shooting, she led him into the living room, where he found Kieth Bryan still breathing and barely alive. Even though Keith Bryan was taken to the hospital, his wife began calling people and telling them he was dead, the officer said. Later, as crime scene investigators were collecting gunpowder residue from the crime scene, she laughed at them and said she thought what they were doing was funny, according to testimony. 'Bryan said she watches (the TV show) CSI and knows all about this stuff,' Mustang police detective Camie McNeil said, according to the Oklahoman.

A 'wheel-chair-bound' benefits cheat who claimed £62,000 has been jailed after it emerged he was an international archer who had travelled to Thailand to pick up a bride. Terry Peake, 64, said it took him 30 minutes to walk 50 to 75 yards since a car accident in 1994 left him 'disabled'. He even claimed he couldn't dress, bathe or go to the toilet without help. But when the Department of Work and Pensions discovered he had represented Britain at the World Masters Games in Melbourne in 2002 - and set up his own business - he went on the run around the world. Scroll down to see video . Peake physical fitness: Terry Peake said he needed help to dress, bath and go to the toilet but meanwhile he represented Britain at archery . Peake, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, . was eventually arrested in February this year, at Birmingham Airport . after a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was a member of the Rochdale Company of Archers and, in 1999, won the Grand Northern title. Investigators secretly filmed him lugging a trailer across a field for the business he had set up, trading specialised licence plates over the web. When he was caught, Peake fled Britain and went to Thailand where he married a local woman and jetted off to Australia. But he was unmasked as a cheat when pictures of him surfaced frolicking in a swimming pool. Caught: Investigators secretly filmed him as he pulled a trailer across a field as he operated a business, trading specialised license plates over the web . At Bolton Crown Court he was jailed for nine months after he pleaded guilty to fraudulently claiming a total of £62, 941.29, between October 2002 and May 2007. Mr Kenneth Grant, prosecuting, said Mr Peake claimed he had not been able to work after the accident and when he started claiming disability allowance in 1994. New love: When he was caught, Peake he did a runner from Britain went to Thailand where he found himself a Thai bride . He also used a wheel chair when he went out because he had trouble standing up. He said claimants, like Mr Peake, were under a duty to notify the DWP of any changes in their circumstances which might affect their entitlement. In early in summer 2006, the DWP became aware that Peake had started a business, trading specialised license plates over the web - which he did not report to the department. Mr Peake failed to attend his first court hearing in October 2007, but attended in June 2008 after being arrested at Birmingham airport. And for the next four years nothing was heard of the defendant - who was living in Thailand with his Thai wife. He was again arrested in February this year, at Birmingham airport. Mr Colin Buckle, defending, added: 'The defendant, prior to these matters, was a man of exemplary character, in full-time employment, until 1991 when he had a, what can only be described as, devastating car accident.' Mr Peake spent the following 18 months in hospital, where he underwent treatment for his injuries. He added: 'He had five separate sites of injury on his spine and was declared disabled and confined to a wheelchair. This was the case for the ten years.' Jet-setter: After marrying he jetted off to Australia where pictures of him emerged frolicking in a swimming pool . But Mr Peake’s condition gradually started to improve from 2000. Mr . Buckle said: 'There came an improvement, the improvement was gradual, . but for all the time the defendant had been claiming benefits.' And . so gradual was this improvement, Mr Buckler said there was no trigger . for the claimant to identify a point to notify the DWP. 'The original claim was quite genuine and received because of the severe injuries the defendant had', he said. Arrested: Peake, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester was eventually arrested in February this year, at Birmingham Airport after a warrant was issued for his arrest . Caged: He was jailed for nine months after he pleaded guilty to fraudulently claiming a total of £62, 941.29, between October 2002 and May 2007 . Mr Buckle said after leaving hospital, Mr Peake felt hard done by - and so he became involved with those who had suffered the same fate he had. Mr Peake became involved in the Commonwealth Games, for which he became a senior communications officer. He even visited all the schools in the Isle of Man, encouraging disabled people to take part in sport - an initiative backed by former gold medalist Tanni Grey Thomspon, who worked very closely with him. Lies: The court heard he started claiming disability allowance in 1994 after a car accident left him 'unable to work' First clue: In early in summer 2006, the DWP became aware that Peake had started a business, trading specialised license plates over the web - which he did not report to the department . Mr . Peake, who limped into the dock, bowed his head as Judge William Morris . told him: 'You are a man of 64. You are a man of good character. You . are a man of positive good character.' He said Mr Peake’s condition had improved and he had failed to notify the DWP, of those changes and changes in circumstances. 'It may not have been a considerable business, but a business it was', he added. He stated suspicion had surrounded Mr Peake, after photographs of him in Australia had surfaced. He added: 'You quite deliberately claimed benefits. This is serious because of course, it’s the tax payer who pays such benefits - that hard-earned money is simply being passed to somebody that had no entitlement to it.' On a website Peake said: 'I took up Archery after a serious car accident which left me in a wheelchair. This was a therapeutic sport which I could do, however over the years I have regained the use of my legs and can now walk for short periods of time with the help of medication. 'I still have disabilities and am registered disabled I no longer work, so I spend my time promoting archery and coaching people who wish to take up the sport. 'I still compete from my wheelchair and shoot all over and have been fortunate to win a selection of trophies , medals over the years. One thing about archery is that any one can do it, whether they have a disability or not. Any age from 8 to 80 it is also a very sociable sport you meet all sorts of people from all walks of life . But DWP Minister for Welfare Reform, Lord Freud, said: 'It’s cases like these that show us why welfare reform is needed. We have a duty to the taxpayer and our customers to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them. 'Benefit fraud takes money away from the most vulnerable. It is a crime and we are committed to stopping it by catching criminals at the front line and making sure our reforms make the benefit system less open to abuse.'","Terry Peake, 64, represented Britain in World Masters Games in Melbourne .

A British businessman who spent four . months without charge in a notorious Hungarian jail following the . collapse of his failed timeshare company is to appear in a Budapest court . today. Michael Turner, who is charged alongside his former business partner, was extradited under a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) in 2009 and spent weeks living in . appalling conditions. He faces fraud charges following the collapse of a . failed timeshare company alongside Jason McGoldrick, 39, from Plymouth, Devon. Trial: Jason McGoldrick and Michael Turner are facing a fraud trial relating to a timeshare business . Their Budapest-based company collapsed . in 2005 and Hungarian prosecutors used EAWs to detain them, alleging . the company’s creditors were the victims of fraud. Mr Turner, 30, has told how he was led . through a busy airport in handcuffs on a dog-style lead when he was . first extradited on November 2, 2009. The businessman, from Corfe Castle, . Dorset, was imprisoned for four months at the Budapest Penitentiary . Institute, where he was kept in his cell for 23 hours a day. Unable to speak the language, and with . no warm clothes, he was only allowed on to a caged roof terrace in . temperatures of -20C for an hour a day and was only allowed one shower a . week, he said. He was released, with no explanation, . on February 26 2010 - having only been interviewed once by police - and . returned to Britain. He later hit out at the British . extradition system and said judges should be given more power to test . the evidence in cases before individuals are extradited under the EAW. Extradited: Retired businessman Christopher Tappin has been deported to a tough Texan detention centre. He is accused of conspiring to sell components for Iranian missiles . Mr Turner and Mr McGoldrick are . expected to appear in court today for a day-long procedural hearing, . ahead of a trial which is due to start in April. Both men deny wrongdoing. The UK’s extradition procedures have . come under the spotlight in recent months amid growing disquiet over the . US-UK treaty and the use of the EAW. Jago Russell, chief executive of Fair . Trials International (FTI), said: 'Michael was the victim of a shocking . misuse of Europe’s fast-track extradition laws and suffered appalling . treatment during the four months he spent needlessly in a Hungarian . jail. 'The time for talking is over: the UK Government must now reform our flawed extradition laws.' The campaign group has called for . reforms of the UK’s extradition arrangements, saying had these changes . been implemented, Mr Turner’s 'ordeal could have been avoided'. The proposed measures include giving . British judges the power to halt extradition until a case is . trial-ready, as well as the power to refuse extradition where the . requesting country is not the appropriate place for a trial to take . place. FTI has also called for the courts to be allowed to seek further information from the requesting state before extradition. Means-testing for legal aid in all . extradition cases should also be abolished and the fixed one-week . deadline to appeal against extradition under a European Arrest Warrant . extended, the campaigners say. And they have called for British nationals or residents to be allowed to serve any sentence in the UK. Today’s court appearances come just . hours after retired British businessman Christopher Tappin was taken . before a court in El Paso, Texas, following his two-year battle against . being sent to America to stand trial.

A former middle school teacher surrendered to authorities Tuesday to face a three-year jail sentence after having sex with a student and offering a plea deal to avoid a sex offender label. Kristen Nicole Sullivan, 27, from Broward, Florida, will serve three years in prison followed by five years probation after the 13-year-old boy's girlfriend discovered the year-long relationship from a cell phone Sullivan purchased him for his 14th birthday. During her probation she will not be allowed to teach children though she narrowly escaped being permanently labeled a sex offender with her decision to serve jail time instead. Serious charges: Kristen Nicole Sullivan, 27, will serve three years behind bars after a year-long sexual relationship with a boy, 13 . 'This way, she doesn't have to register as a sex offender, which would follow you the rest of your life,' Sullivan's attorney Bradford Cohen told the Sun Sentinel. Mr Cohen admitted Sullivan 'should have known better,' explaining it as 'a serious lapse in judgement.' Jail time plea: The middle school teacher, 27, made a plea agreement to avoid being labeled a sex offender . Sullivan, charged with two counts of sexual battery on a victim between 12 and 17 years of age by a person with custodial authority, originally faced up to 30 years for these two counts alone. She was also charged, however, with two counts of lewd and lascivious battery on a victim between 12 and 16 years of age that could have been punishable by up to an additional 15 years in prison. She was arrested in April 2010 after . the victim's girlfriend, both students at Lauderhill Middle School, . reported the affair to the police. The teen was in Sullivan's computer class.

He claims they then had sex in the computer room the next morning, but she denies this. When . his girlfriend found messages which read: 'I’m tired of being the one . chasing you' and 'Why are you ignoring me?' he confessed that he had a . relationship with her. Police monitored a telephone call between the student and Sullivan on . April 19, 2010, confirming the sexual nature of the relationship, . according to the report. The reason she was given such a light . sentence is because the prosecutors acknowledged that it was the . student and not she who was the pursuer.","Kristen Nicole Sullivan will serve jail time instead of receiving a sex offender label .

A German clothes firm favoured by neo-Nazis has provoked outrage for calling its new store Brevik - which critics say is in honour of right-wing Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik. Thousands of people have complained about the store in Chemnitz which, although not spelled the same, is frequented by the radical right who like to wear its Thor Steinar-brand clothes. 'This scandalous choice of name has shown a new level of aggression, and violent right-wing tendencies from Thor Steinar,' said Hanka Kliese of the Social Democratic Party. Criticism: German clothes firm Thor Steinar is under fire for calling its new store in Chemnitz (left) Brevik, similar to the name of Anders Behring Breivik (right) Outrage: The firm did have a store called Brevik, named after the Norwegian town, in Hamburg but it shut in 2008 . The chain has defended itself by pointing out that it names all its branches after the village of Brevik, south of Oslo. But critics say this is not enough to explain the choice of a name almost identical to that of Norwegian right-wing extremist who murdered 77 people in a shooting spree on a holiday island in Norway in July last year.

Anders Behring Breivik was today indicted on terror and murder charges for his bomb and murder rampage. But prosecutors said it was likely the confessed killer would not go to prison for Norway's worst peacetime massacre. They said they considered the 33-year-old to be psychotic and would seek a sentence of involuntary commitment to psychiatric care. This would happen, instead of imprisonment, unless new information about his mental health emerges during the trial set to start in April. As expected, they charged him under a paragraph in Norway's anti-terror law that refers to violent acts intended to disrupt key government functions or spread fears in the population. He has confessed to the July 22 attacks but denies criminal guilt, portraying the victims as 'traitors' for embracing immigration policies he claims will result in an Islamic colonisation of Norway. 'We have already contacted the landlord and will plan every step necessary to shut down this business as quickly as possible.' Saxony, the state in which Chemnitz . lies, has been making headlines in recent months because of the National . Socialist Underground. It is a neo-Nazi terrorist cell that . murdered 10 people over 13 years. The group lived for a time in both . Chemnitz and nearby Zwickau during their years in hiding. Thor Steinar is favoured by right-wing thugs. Norway has long sought to distance itself from the German brand, which has used the Norwegian flag and other Nordic symbols on its products. 'We consider it very regrettable that Thor Steinar uses Norwegian place names in order to associate Norway as such with Thor Steinar and the extreme right-wing scene,' said Anne-Kirsti Wendel Karlsen of the Norwegian Embassy in Berlin. 'Acting at the request of a number of communities, we have asked that Norwegian town names not be used.

The wife of a senior Chinese Communist Party official could face the death penalty if convicted of the murder of murder of a British businessman after being named prime suspect in the case. Gu Kailai, the wife ex-Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai, is being held on suspicion of killing Neil Heywood, who died in the city last November. Bo has himself been suspended from the party's 25-member Politburo on suspicion of involvement in 'serious discipline violations'. Suspicious death? Gu Kailai (left), the wife of fallen Chinese city leader Bo Xilai, has been accused of playing a part in the death of British businessman Neil Heywood (right), who had close links to the family . The Chinese government said a fresh investigation into the murder is under way, and named Gu, Mr Bo's 53-year-old second wife, and Zhang Xiaojun, 'an orderly at Bo's home' as suspects. The pair have been 'transferred to judicial authorities on suspected crime of intentional homicide'. The maximum penalty for murder in China is death. Bo is the most senior leader to be . suspended from the Politburo since Shanghai's party chief was removed . for corruption six years ago. The announcements provide details on what has been a lurid, divisive and embarrassing affair for the China's leadership. The scandal has brought political infighting out of the usually closed confines of elite party politics and into public view. The brief announcement about Bo's . suspension did not elaborate on what rules he is suspected of violated. However, the charge is broad enough to cover everything from corruption . to the mishandling of internal party affairs. Initial reports from Chinese . officials told that Mr Heywood, a 41-year-old British businessman, died . in Chongqing last November from excess alcohol. But, . in a startling and almost unprecedented leak, a senior police chief . cast doubt on the official cause of death by claiming the father-of-two . may have been poisoned. Purged: Allegations that the wife of Chongqing leader Bo Xilai (above) may have been behind Mr Heywood's death given an insight into events that forced him from office . Countless rumours and speculation, . fuelled by Chinese online whistleblowers, suggested his death was linked . to his professional relationship with Bo. In startling claims, the city's former police chief, Wang . Lijun, is said to have told Bo he believed his wife Gu was involved in . Mr Heywood's death in the southwestern Chinese city, according to a . Reuters source. It . has also been alleged that a new report reveals how Mr Heywood told . friends he feared for his safety after falling out with Gu, according to . the Sunday Telegraph. Claims that she may have been behind his death were the first direct account of events which eventually led to Mr Bo's downfall last month. Mr Bo recently made a very public bid for a place in the Party's inner circle when new members are installed later this year. A source, citing accounts coming from an . unfinished central investigation, said it was unclear how much truth . there was to the claim by Wang. But he said had 'no doubt' that Wang had raised it with Bo. The account helps explain the apparent rupture between the city chief and Wang, who led Bo's widely applauded crackdown on crime in China's most populous metropolis. In early February, Mr Wang briefly sought refuge in the U.S. consulate in Chengdu, several hours' drive from Chongqing, which suddenly made the growing scandal public. Power: Chinese paramilitary police patrol the grounds of the Communist Party provincial head office in Chongqing which was the office of Bo Xilai . Mr Bo, 62, and his wife had disappeared from public view since his abrupt removal on March 15 as party chief of Chongqing. Gu was already believed to . be under arrest, according to The Sunday Times. They cannot respond . publicly to the rumours and reports, nor can Wang, who is under . investigation. The . Chongqing government has not answered repeated phone calls and faxed . questions from Reuters about the circumstances of Bo's downfall and Mr . Heywood's death. The central government has said the . results of its investigation into Wang's flight to the consulate will be . released, but to date it has not offered a detailed account. The Foreign Ministry has also not answered questions about Heywood, with a spokesman saying that he had no information. In . a news conference days before his dismissal, Bo scorned as nonsense . unspecified accusations of misdeeds by his wife and said some people . were pouring 'filth on my family'. Gu was formerly a high-powered . lawyer. 'Wang Lijun . has told central investigators that Gu Kailai turned on the British man . because of economic interests and that she wanted to destroy him . (Heywood),' said the source, who is generally sympathetic to Bo. Beijing . and London-based relatives of Heywood told Reuters in separate . interviews that they did not suspect foul play in his death. They both . spoke on condition of anonymity. Favours: Mr Heywood is said to have helped the Bos' secure top British public school berths for their son, Bo Guagua, centre . Access: Mr Bo's son Bi Guagua, seen here on the right with action movie star Jackie Chan, left, won places at Harrow and Oxford . 'It's . preposterous. The more description (in the media), the darker it . becomes,' the family member said, occasionally breaking into tears in an . interview in the lobby lounge of a hotel on the outskirts of Beijing . late on Thursday. The family denied reports that Heywood was a spy and that he was cremated against their wishes. 'We requested the cremation. We were not forced to do so. We have no doubts about the police report,' said one family member. Dismissed Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai had built a national reputation as a crusader against organised crime and corruption among China's elite. But now a very different picture of his mafia-busting initiative — called da hei, or smash black —  is emerging, since Mr. Bo was fired last month after a scandal involving his police chief Wang Lijun. Critics called his clampdown, launched in 2009, the 'red terror', saying state security apparatus were allowed to act with impunity: framing victims, extracting confessions through torture, extorting business empires and visiting retribution on Mr Bo's  political rivals. Cheng Li, an analyst of the Chinese leadership at the Brookings Institution, told the New York Times: ‘Even by Chinese Communist Party standards, this is unacceptable.’ He added: ‘This is red terror.’ In 10 months, 4,781 people were arrested, including business executives, police officers, judges, legislators and others accused of running or protecting criminal syndicates, according to the New York Times. Chongqing’s top justice official was even found to have buried $3 million under a fish pond, during the crackdown. He became one of 13 da hei defendants to be executed. But Mr Bo's spectacular fall from grace was sparked when his enforcer, police chief Wang Lijun last month sought refuge in a United States consulate. He apparently feared for his safety after telling Mr Bo that his family was linked to an inquiry into the death of a British citizen, Neil Heywood, who was an acquaintance of Mr Bo’s family. The . British Embassy in Beijing has asked the Chinese government to . reinvestigate his death, attributed by Chongqing police to cardiac . arrest due to over-consumption of alcohol. Heywood married Chinese national Wang Lulu after moving to the country and they had two children, Olivia, 11, and son Peter, 7. He . was not a heavy drinker, but was a chain smoker. His father, Peter, . also died of a heart attack after drinks over dinner at his London home . in 2004 at age 63, the family members said. It is understood Mr Heywood helped . arrange business meetings with Mr Bo when he was a government minister . in the Ministry of Commerce in the capital, Beijing. It is also claimed Mr Heywood helped . the Bos secure top British public school berths for their son, Bo . Guagua, who studied at Harrow and Oxford, though this cannot be . confirmed. The source . said that according to Wang, Gu believed Heywood had abused or taken Bo . family funds to which the Briton might have had access. Heywood's . family members said he had no business dealings with the Bos. The . source's account of Wang Lijun's accusations tallies with details that . have emerged about the drama that unfolded before he took flight to the . U.S. consulate in Chengdu, where he stayed for 24 hours before officials . coaxed him out. The . emerging accounts help explain why central leaders decided to risk the . aftershocks triggered by unseating Bo, an ex-commerce minister known . both for revolutionary style populism and for his courting of . multinationals. By . the time Wang arrived at the U.S. consulate, his relationship with his . long-time patron, Bo, had already curdled into mutual distrust, said the . source. According . to the source and previous accounts reported by Reuters, Wang feared . that Bo, eager to preserve his reputation and chances for a spot in the . next central leadership, could turn on him after central party . investigators began probing Wang's past. About . a week before his flight to the consulate, Wang told Bo about his . suspicions about the death of Heywood, a business consultant who was . instrumental in Bo's son attending Harrow, an exclusive private school . in England. Heywood . knew the Bo family from the time when he lived in China's northeastern . port city of Dalian, where Bo was mayor from 1993 to 2000. '(Wang) told Bo that the problem couldn't be covered up,' said the source. Bo . was outraged, said the source, who has met both men. Days later, Bo . demoted Wang to the much less powerful role of vice mayor for education, . culture and science. Bo . initially tried to muffle the allegations, but the former police . chief's flight to the consulate brought the rupture between the men into . the open, said the source. Even . if Wang's suspicions over Heywood's death prove unfounded, Bo's initial . failure to report the case could end his political career, said the . source. 'In the . central leadership's view, that was too late. They said he should have . reported the problem as soon as Wang Lijun raised allegations about Gu . Kailai.'","Officials initially said fixer Neil Heywood died of excess alcohol .

The charred remains of the Washington house that crazed father Josh Powell blew up when he was determined to kill himself and his two young sons has been removed after serving as a disturbing reminder of the horrific incident for two months. The home in Graham, Washington was where Powell killed trapped his two sons Charlie, 7, and Braden, 5, during a supervised visit before he chopped them with a hatchet and lit two gasoline cans to create a fatal blaze on Feburary 5. A demolition crew tore away every trace of the home- including the driveway- on Thursday. Rubble: The charred remains of the Washington house where crazed father Josh Powell blew up himself and his two sons was when he was  removed after serving as a disturbing reminder of the incident for two months . What remains: The house was set up as a sham to fool the social worker who supervised the family's visits . A demolition crew tore away every trace of the home- including the driveway- on Thursday . 'It’s a hell of a sight,' said Patrick Small, the property owner who rented the house to Powell since 2011. '“Every time the neighbors walk out the door, they get reminded just by looking. It’s a horrible sight to look at,' he told the local Bellingham Herald. The house was valued at $158,900 before the fire, and because he only had $100,000 worth of insurrance on the home, Mr Small is 'out about 60,000 bucks'. The ghastly remains of the home have served as a reminder of the unanswered questions surrounding the case. Powell was married to Susan Cox Powell, who went missing from their home in December 2009 in West Valley, Utah. He returned to his hometown of Puyallup, Washington with his sons but lost custody after his father, Steven Powell, was arrested for investigation of voyeurism and child pornography.

George Osborne’s plan to impose a ‘Heritage Tax’ on listed buildings would rake in almost half a billion pounds – with nearly a quarter coming from the Church of England. Figures buried in Treasury documents reveal the full implications of the Chancellor’s move to ‘simplify’ the VAT treatment of alterations to listed buildings. Grade One and Grade Two listed buildings currently incur VAT only on routine repair work, for example to a damaged roof, and not on improvement, alteration and restoration works. Work to replace the thatched roof on a listed cottage. Thatchers are devastated at plans to impose 20 per cent VAT on the job . However, the exemption will end in October under new measures in the Budget and the rate will rise to the standard 20 per cent.  In the next five years, the tax hike is expected to raise £450million for the Treasury. The Church estimates the move will cost congregations £20million a year – equal to £100million over the next five years. Other heritage groups have issued warnings over the plans, with the National Trust suggesting it will cause problems for the owners of listed buildings, who already typically face higher costs for improving or repairing their homes. Although straightforward repair works on listed buildings have long attracted VAT,  churches are able to claim much of the money back from a special government fund. Warning: The Bishop of Hereford says a big VAT bill would wreck plans to improve the cathedral . The rebate scheme is to be extended to cover alterations. But only £5million of new money has been announced, and the latest figures suggest churches are already unable to claim back more than half of the VAT they incur on renovations. In the West Country, the proposal has been dubbed the ‘thatch tax’ because of its potential impact on the region’s thatched cottages. Andrew Raffle, secretary of the National Society of Master Thatchers, said: ‘Unfortunately 20 per cent is a huge amount of tax.’ The Treasury insists the move will end an ‘anomaly’ which allows millionaires to install improvements such as swimming pools without paying VAT just because they happen to live in a listed building. Despite the extra £5million made available to help soften the blow to the Church, the proposals have caused anger across the country, with many congregations seeing their hopes of building improvements disappear. Yesterday the deans of 23 cathedrals including Canterbury, Durham and York signed an open letter to Mr Osborne urging him to ‘change his policy to one that will support rather than damage our nation’s heritage’.They warned that the move ‘seriously damages the sustainability of many of our great buildings’. Anthony Priddis, the Bishop of Here ford, believes a VAT bill of £150,000 could wreck plans for improvement to the cathedral. He said: ‘There has been more anger about this decision than any other I have witnessed for a very long time.’ Church estates commissioner Tony Baldry, Tory MP for Banbury, Oxfordshire, has written to the Chancellor urging a rethink. He said: ‘It is now going to be 20 per cent more expensive for communities up and down the country who are trying to make buildings more adaptable. ‘It has been difficult to see the evidence Treasury officials have for the use of it. I hope ministers will understand the concerns of local communities.’ Anthony Priddis, the Bishop of Hereford, says there is a lot of anger over the decision and says a VAT bill of £150,000 could wreck plans for improvement to the cathedral - pictured . Canon Tony Dickinson, of St Francis of Assisi church in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, which is in the middle of a £250,000 renovation project, said: ‘We are not a large congregation and we don’t have a long history of resources. It is all a bit like playing roulette. We are quite worried. My treasurer gets greyer and more lined each time I see him. We live in hope that people will respond generously as it is a landmark building.’ Jonathan Greener, Dean of Wakefield Cathedral, where a £3million restoration project is under way, estimated the new tax would add £200,000 to the bill. He described the plans as a ‘raid on our nation’s heritage’. Churches say they are investing increasingly heavily in alterations to bring their buildings up to date and open them up for community use. The Treasury insists the measure  is justified. A spokesman said it was unfair that wealthy individuals  were able to make alterations to  listed mansions without incurring VAT. ‘Over time significant anomalies have developed, causing very similar products to be taxed very differently. The Government is taking steps to correct these anomalies, including aligning the alterations of listed buildings with the existing VAT treatment of repairs.’","The Church estimates the move will cost congregations £20million a year .

Rodney Hogg saw the body of his climbing friend Peter Kinloch on a ledge 1,000 ft below the peak as he neared the top of the mountain. Mr Kinloch, 28, had been attempting the Seven Summits Challenge last year, in which climbers attempt to conquer the highest peak of each continent. Frozen body: Peter Kinloch, left, with his climbing buddy Rod Hogg, right, on a previous exhibition. Hogg found his friend's body on an expedition last month . But as he descended from the peak of Everest the Scots-born climber got into difficulty in bad weather conditions and died of frostbite and exhaustion. Fellow climbers in his party said the 28-year-old , who was an IT specialist with Merseyside Police, suffered snow blindess and lost co-ordination before collapsing. Three Nepalese Sherpas spent hours trying to resuscitate the climber but were forced to abandon his body on the mountain. Climbing buddies: Peter Kinloch, left, and Rod Hogg, who found his friend's body on the mountain . Mr Hogg, 44, told the Mirror newspaper: 'When I saw him I instantly knew it was Peter. You could see his face. It was like he was lying on his back taking a rest.' The BBC employee was raising money for Children In Need and had the charity's mascot Pudsey Bear with him as he climbed the peak in May with a 10-man team. 'It was too dangerous to climb down to get closer to him so I had an emotional moment up there to pay my respects,' said Mr Hogg. Grim find: Rod Hogg said his friend's body was preserved by the ice . Mr Kinloch's parents had asked their son's friend to bring back the dead man's camera if found as it contained the last pictures of their son, including his happiness at achieving the summit of Everest, but it was not possible to retrieve the camera. Mr Hogg explained that the Sherpas had clipped his friend to a fixed line on the mountainside before he died, which means his body is likely to remain there forever unless he is cut free. Everest holds the bodies of at least 200 climbers who have died in their attempts to scale the mountain, say experts. The mountain is five-and-a-half miles above sea level, with an exact height of 29,029ft, and straddles the border of Nepal and Tibet in the Himalayas.",His body was preserved by the ice.

Drama: The 60-year-old complained of feeling unwell at his Yonkers apartment (pictured) three hours after returning home . She dialled 911 and Mr Mollo was rushed to hospital, but despite emergency treatment he died. Doctors described Mr Mollo's death as an unusual case of secondary drowning. Water that got into Mr Mollo's lungs led to breathing difficulties which could have been exacerbated by medical issues he already had, television network WABC-TV reported. Medics said the relatively rare phenomenon probably began with his self-rescue. It typically occurs when someone almost drowns - with water entering the lungs - but they survive. Dr Gabe Wilson, associate director of St Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, told ABC news: 'Conceivably water could be inhaled while one still had the means to pull themselves out, but it would certainly be a rare occurrence as usually panic sets in by then.' The water that entered the lungs can start to cause problems rapidly, with an onset ranging from between one and 48 hours. Rare: In cases of secondary drowning, inhaling salt water - like that found in the Long Island Sound (pictured) - can more more harmful to the lungs than fresh water . Because problems develop so quickly, there is no known warning signs, which means anyone who has a near-drowning experience should still seek emergency medical advice for potential 24-hour observation. Secondary drowning can cause lung damage because water comes into direct contact with the lining cells, impeding functions like supplying oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. Damage can be especially severe when salt water is inhaled into the lungs. According to ABC News, Dr Wilson added: 'It’s conceivable that the drowning episode and lack of oxygen led to a heart problem, like a cardiac arrhythmia or a myocardial infarct (heart attack).' He added that, with prompt medical attention, secondary drownings would be survivable, . Now watch the video .","Tommy Mollo, 60, fell off a boat but pulled himself out of the water .

On Saturday police in the small Central American country of El Salvador were not called upon to attend a homicide. The Pacific Ocean country, which is sandwiched between Guatemala and Honduras, has been plagued by violence for years as rival drug gangs fight to gain control. However, this weekend's murder-free day may be an indication that recent attempts to crackdown on the violent clashes may be paying off. Cessation: Members of the Mara 18 gang (pictured) have called a truce with the Mara Salvatrucha gang on the streets of El Salvador . It is the first 'clear day' since President Mauricio Funes took office in June 2009. Below is a list of the countries with the highest murder rates per 100,000 of the population in 2011: . 1. Honduras - 86 . 2. El Salvador - 71 . 3. Saint Kitts and Nevis - 68 . 4. Venezuala - 67 . 5. Belize - 39 . 6. Guatemala - 39 . 7. Jamaica - 39 . 8. Bahamas - 36 . 9. Colombia - 33 . 10.

El Salvador is one of a glutch of Central and South American countries that experience high murder rates. Guatemala, Honduras and Belize also have some of the highest murder figures in the World and much of the blame for El Salvador's problems is being laid at . the door of Mexico's drug cartels which use the country as a transit . point. Poverty, lack of education, corruption in different areas of society and lack of money are also seen as possible causes. Mr Funes, who attended this weekend's .

Complimentary: Labour leader Ed Miliband was quick to take advantage of frosty relations between Andrew Lansley and the Royal College of Nursing . Labour leader Ed Miliband called on NHS staff and patients today to hold the Government to account for difficulties resulting from its controversial reforms to the health service. In a speech to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) conference in Harrogate, Mr Miliband launched a Labour initiative called NHS Check which will allow people to report online on problems faced by hospitals, clinics and family doctors arising from Health Secretary Andrew Lansley's shake-up. Seeking to capitalise on the coalition's fraught relations with NHS workers, Mr Miliband hailed nurses as the 'the defenders of the health service' against market-oriented reforms which he said would divert resources from the front line and lead to disruption, fragmentation and longer waits for treatment. After Mr Lansley was heckled and jeered by the RCN conference yesterday, Mr Miliband accused ministers of refusing to listen to legitimate concerns. Despite the reservations expressed by nurses to the NHS shake-up, the Government had ""ploughed on regardless"". Mr Miliband urged NHS health and wellbeing boards - which will have strategic oversight of local commissioning - to resist new charges for treatment and ensure patients come before profits. 'The Government have been acting like they are the masters, not the servants, of the NHS. They are not the masters. Not this government. Not any government,' he said. 'It's owned by the people of Britain. Our health service is owned by patients, professionals and the people. And their voice - your voice - deserves to be heard. Under pressure: Mr Lansley faced a frosty reception at the RCN conference yesterday, although he wasn't booed . 'I can't promise that we will always . agree about everything. But what I will never do is what this Government . did: dismiss you as just a 'vested interest'. You were not a vested . interest. You were the defenders of the health service.' Mr Miliband described nurses as the 'backbone of the NHS' and said he wants to ""forge a partnership"" with the RCN to address the long-term challenges facing the NHS. Mr Miliband's speech comes after Mr Lansley received a rough reception from the RCN yesterday. He was laughed at by members of the audience after saying nurses should tell superiors if staffing levels were not safe. Some in the crowd shouted ""liar"" after the Health Secretary claimed clinical staffing levels had increased on his watch. I'm listening: Mr Ed Miliband speaks to nurses after his speech . Heated exchange: Delegates cheer another delegate questioning the Health Secretary yesterday . David Cameron's official spokesman said the Prime Minister had full confidence in Mr Lansley. The spokesman said: 'Whenever you are trying to reform a bit of the public sector and make changes, you should expect some opposition to that. 'But we think it is important to reform the NHS. Although we are protecting the NHS budget, an ageing population and increasing costs of treatments mean that we need to reform the health service. 'We want to work with healthcare professionals as we do that.' Over the past two years the Royal College of Nursing has repeatedly issued dire warnings that thousands of nursing posts are facing the axe. Ministers have always denied these claims, consistently stating they ‘do not recognise’ the RCN’s figures. Yesterday the union issued yet another report with figures showing that since March 2010, two months before the Coalition was formed, a total of 3,588 nursing and midwifery posts have gone. Again, the Government denied these claims and said initially said that there were actually only 450 fewer nursing posts. They pointed out that the overall number of clinical roles – which include doctors, scientists, radiologists as well as nurses – had increased. But the NHS’s own figures show that the RCN are right – there were 311,787 nursing posts in March 2010 compared with just 308,199 now. And yesterday for the first time Health Secretary Andrew Lansley conceded that the NHS had lost ‘about’ 3,500 nurses. The Government are correct to state that the clinical posts have gone up, though – there are 3,556 more compared with two years ago. Many of these include scientists, radiologists who carry out x-rays and sonographers who perform ultrasounds, as well as doctors. While the RCN acknowledge these roles are valuable, they say that trying to save money by cutting nursing posts is ‘unintelligent’ – and will inevitably harm patient care.","Labour leader asks nurses to report problems caused by NHS reforms .

The mother of a man who killed eight employees at a beer distribution warehouse in Manchester, Connecticut two years ago has set up an anti-racism website for her late son. Lillie Holliday's site, www.ostmemorialfund.com , is set up as a memorial for her son, Omar Thornton and solicits donations to fight institutionalized racism. 'As a mother, I do not want any other mother to experience what I did in losing a son as a result of the impact of racism in the workplace,' she says in a statement on the website. Controversial: Lillie Holliday, left, has set up a memorial site for her son Omar Thorton, right, who killed eight people before turning the gun on himself . Giving spirit: The site asks for donations to 'bring awareness to the evils of racism' The site provides a link for donations, saying they will 'assist in shaping a safer environment for our families and loved ones.' State officials have launched an investigation into the legality of the fund, according to the Hartford Courant. Thornton, who was black, shot 10 people, eight of them fatally, within three minutes on August 3, 2010 at the Hartford Distributors warehouse, before killing himself in what police said was the worst mass shooting ever in Connecticut. Immediately before the shootings, Thornton was fired for stealing beer. Before killing himself, he called 911 and told an operator: 'This place is a racist place. They're treating me bad over here. And treat all other black employees bad over here, too. Caught on camera: A security camera at the Hartford-area warehouse shows Thornton stealing beer; moments later, he shot dead eight of his co-workers . ‘So I took it to my own hands and handled the problem. I wish I could have got more of the people.'A police investigation concluded there was no evidence to support the claim of racism. Claudette Carveth, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Consumer Protection, said Wednesday that her department's enforcement division has been investigating the website since receiving a complaint on May 7. She said they have no record of that memorial fund being registered with the state. 'We will continue to look at this organization, its intent and its practices and make sure they are complying with the law,' she said. Mass tragedy: Thornton shot ten people - eight were killed in the shootings; he told a 911 operator: 'I took it to my own hands and handled the problem. I wish I could have got more of the people' Laid to rest: Mourners moved the coffin of Louis Felder from the Congregation Aqudath Sholom in Stamford, Connecticut after his funeral . Christopher Roos, a manager of the Teamsters local that represents workers at the warehouse, said he and other employees are upset by the site, which he said has opened even more wounds. 'As a mother, I do not want any other mother to experience what I did in losing a son as a result of the impact of racism in the workplace.' -Lillie Holliday . 'It's basically her insinuating that these guys were racist, the company was racist and that the Teamsters are racist, and that isn't true,' he said. 'If she wants to have a fund for her son, that's fine, but don't say it's for racism, because that isn't why he did it. He did it because he had psychological problems.' Holliday, who did not immediately return phone calls and emails from The Associated Press, told WTIC-TV she should be allowed to grieve in her own way. 'That is my son. That's my baby. And as his mother, I should have the right to do whatever I want to do in my son's honour,' she said. 'And I don't know why would that make them upset.' Holliday also said that she plans to use the funds donated to the website to conduct an independent investigation of the shootings.","Omar Thornton fired from warehouse for steeling beer in 2010; immediately returned with gun and shot dead eight workers .

It has been said that behind every powerful man is a strong woman and a cheeky remark by a senior Liberal Democrat suggests that is the key to the Deputy Prime Minister's working life. Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, joked yesterday that Nick Clegg starts his text messages OMG – or On Miriam’s Guidance. He made the playful comment that Nick Clegg is steered by his wife of twelve years, Miriam, at an informal lunch for journalists. Powerful woman: Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, right, joked yesterday that Nick Clegg, left, starts his text messages OMG or On Miriam's Guidance . A spokesman for Mr Clegg said the remarks were made in jest and the Deputy Prime Minister had found them 'very funny'. His light-hearted comments follow the revelation that David Cameron signed off his messages 'LOL' to mean 'lots of love' to Rebekah Brooks, the News International boss. 'Rebekah Brooks and I have more than red hair in common,' said Mr Alexander. 'I have also had problems with text messages from a senior member of the government. But mine come from the Deputy Prime Minister rather than the Prime Minister. Centre stage: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Miriam Gonzalez arrive at the Royal Wedding last year - Mr Alexander made the cheeky remark that Nick Clegg is steered by his wife of twelve years, Miriam, at an informal lunch for journalists . 'The first few months of our time in office, I thought we were getting really stressed out because every text he sent me started with the letters ‘OMG’. 'But it turns out that this is code in the Clegg household for ‘On Miriam's Guidance’.' Nick Clegg's wife, 44, is known by her maiden name González Durántez. She is a senior lawyer for a City firm - she left DLA Piper this year and is now head of European Union trade and government affairs at the law firm Dechert LLP. During the 2010 general elections Mrs Clegg did appear by her husband's side and publicly said that she would be 'willing to help' with the campaign but, unlike Samantha Cameron, she would be unable to take time off from work and her family life to take part. Career focused: During the 2010 general elections Mrs Clegg did appear by her husband's side but said unlike Samantha Cameron, she would be unable to take time off from work and her family life to take part . She told a Spanish newspaper that there were ‘a number of reasons why I would quit my job...if Nick were Prime Minister and I had to support the country, I would have no problem in doing so’. The couple married in 2000 and Mr Clegg has admitted he found himself ‘bewitched’ by his future wife Miriam, when they were both studying in Belgium, even learning Spanish to woo her. Last year she told women's magazine Grazia how she was 'surprised' when people asked her how she coped with three children and a busy working life. 'I always get very surprised when I’m asked this question because, you know, I have three children, I have a busy career and I have a very busy husband,' she said. 'Yet my husband has three children, he has a much busier career than I have, and he has a busy wife.' She also said Mr Clegg 'kills himself' balancing being a good father and a good leader of the Liberal Democrats. Lolgate: Mr Alexanders' cheeky comments follows revelation that David Cameron signed off his messages 'LOL' to mean 'lots of love' to Rebekah Brooks, the News International boss . She does not appear often in public, although she has featured in Vogue style files. Her husband paled into insignificance last April when they arrived at the Royal Wedding - her outfit was reminiscent of a Spanish flamenco dancer, with a bright orange hat teamed with bright orange lipstick, a dress swathed in black netting, long black leather gloves, black stilettos. Mrs Clegg, a Roman Catholic, admits that she refused her husband’s plea to give English names to their three sons, Antonio, Alberto and Miguel. Mr Clegg said: ‘Miriam told me in no uncertain terms that if they had to live with this short, stubby Anglo-Saxon name of Clegg, then they needed something a little more exotic to come before it.’ Mr Alexander also used yesterday's speech for party matters - he said voters should not  'write off' Liberal Democrats. 'I believe as a party we are making an enormous contribution to this government. We will continue to anchor this government firmly in the centre ground,' he said.","Danny Alexander, cracked the joke that the Nick Clegg is steered by his wife, Miriam González Durántez, at a lunch for journalists .

Long summer holidays are cancelled for thousands of Vauxhall workers – but they’re still celebrating a famous victory and massive boost to the UK economy that has left German rivals reeling. Scrapping the ‘traditional’ long car industry factory summer shutdowns is a central part of a ‘ground-breaking’ new round-the-clock flexibility deal which has secured its future, . Vauxhall’s Ellesmere Port plant has been handed £125million investment to build the new Astra model from 2015, with the creation of 700 direct jobs on top of the 2,100 already secured. Driving forward: American bosses at Vauxhall's US parent company General Motors judged that British workers are more flexible, competitive and efficient - and less militant - than their counterparts in Germany . There will also be 3,000 more indirect jobs with suppliers thanks to £1billion of parts business generated by the deal. The deal led Vauxhall’s giant American parent company General Motors to choose it to build the next generation Astra ahead of a rival German factory judged less efficient, competitive, hard-working or flexible  – and in a country struggling with a deepening Euro crisis. Prime Minister David Cameron hailed it as ‘excellent news’ for the factory and for UK manufacturing on the same day it was announced  that export-driven UK car production, soared by nearly 10 per cent in April. Business Secretary Vince Cable said it was ‘fantastic news’ while Vauxhall bosses called it ‘a historic day.’ One insider said: ‘The German trade unions will go bonkers.’ Under the ‘unprecedented ‘ flexibility deal on pay and conditions agreed with a 94 per cent  majority by the workforce, the plant will  work 51 weeks a year,  increase the number of shifts from two to three per day, and  have a long-term four year pay agreement to ensure stability. There is also the option for Saturday working and a 40 hour week when demand requires. The traditional summer shutdown in July and August will be scrapped to allow production to run through. But there will be a short shut-down between Christmas and New Year, said Vauxhall. The four year pay deal also comprises a two year pay freeze from 2013 followed by two years of real terms increases of RPI inflation plus 1 per cent. The new workforce agreement comes into force in 2013 and runs through the life of the next generation Astra, into the early 2020s. Production will soar from 140,000 now to 160,000 and up to a capacity of 225,000. Vauxhall chairman Duncan Aldred, who first worked at the Ellesmere Port factory 20 years ago as a graduate, said it was a ‘historic day’ for Vauxhall. Busy: Production at the Ellesmere Port factory is to soar from the current 140,000 cars a year to 225,000 . Of the flexibility deal he said: ’It will do away with the somewhat old fashioned factory shut-downs which have been in place in the UK workplace for centuries.’ Mr Aldred said: ‘It really does put Vauxhall Motors  at the forefront of  manufacturing, not only in this country but across Europe.’ Vauxhall will also raise the amount of ‘British-sourced components in the Astra to at least 25 per cent which will create further employment locally and in the UK overall and further increase the plant's competitiveness. Ellesmere Port will be the lead plant to build the next generation five-door Astra hatchback  plus one other variant – either the Sports Tourer estate or the sporty GTC. That is to be decided. But it means a German factory at Bochum – which was also bidding to build the next generation Astra – now faces the axe with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs. Currently German workers at Bochum produce just 30 cars a hour over three shifts. By contrast, Ellesmere Port  workers produce 47 cars an hour on just two shifts – and will boost that even more when they move tho round the clock working of three shifts. The deal turns on its head the notion that British plants  are first in line for closure because their ‘flexibility’ means they are easier and cheaper to shut than in Germany where the cost of lay of are significantly more expensive. Instead, the flexible agreements have proved a magnet for foreign investment. Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘This is excellent news for Ellesmere Port and for UK manufacturing. ‘Once again we have seen the success of the UK automotive industry and the crucial role it plays in growing and rebalancing our economy.’ He added: ‘This has been a real team effort with the Government, the company, unions and workers all focused on keeping production in the UK. ‘And the workforce at Ellesmere Port should take great pride in their skill, hard work and commitment which has proved vital to ensuring this great result today.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was ‘proud’ to be at the factory for the announcement, describing it as a ‘very great day’. ‘The fact that big American car companies are making big investments in Britain is a good signal.’ Mr Cable stressed how productive the Ellesmere Port factory is when he held talks in New York with bosses from Vauxhall's parent firm General Motors . Mr Cable said there were no major taxpayer subsidies but that Vauxhall was free to apply for regional grants for training: ’We’ve not been waving a cheque book.’ He said that while the fate of the Euro might have played a part in GM’s decision, he did not believe it was the deciding factor. Competiveness was. Leading motor industry expert Professor Garel Rhys said he was sounded out by General Motors’ American bosses about the relative efficiency of the UK and German factories adding: ‘They have looked rationally and forensically at the data. Vauxhall’s Ellesmere Port factory has the second lowest unit costs for production anywhere in Europe. The Germans have had a shock.’ Prof Rhys, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business Schoolpredicted UK car production could hit a record 2.4million by 2015, beating the previous record of 1.92million set in 1972. The official projection for this year is 1.55million. ‘The UK motor industry is on a roll, he added. 'Some 80 per cent of UK-built cars are now exported - the highest in Europe. We’re faring far better than the Continent and the Euro-zone which is struggling.’ Latest motor industry figures showed a near 10% rise in the number of cars built in Britain compared to a year ago - boosted by strong export demand, new figures showed. There were 94,352 cars produced in April, an increase of 9.3% on the same month in 2011, and up by 11.8% for the first four months of the year. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the figures showed that the UK remained one of the most competitive countries for car firms. Almost half a million cars were built in the UK in the first four months of the year, with more than 400,000 for export. The number of engines built increased by 1.2% last month to 192,408, while commercial vehicle production rose by 3.2% to almost 9,000, although it was 9% down in the year to date. Paul Everitt, SMMT chief executive, said: ‘It is great news that Vauxhall will retain its Ellesmere Port plant and another important vote of confidence for the UK automotive industry, adding to the wave of recent investment decisions that have backed our facilities and workforce. “Manufacturing is now core to our country’s economy and the partnership forged between companies, employees, trades unions and government in the UK automotive industry demonstrates that the country is a globally competitive place to do business.’","Announcement ends months of nail-biting over future of Cheshire plant .

A little girl with learning difficulties has been banned from her local Brownie group over 'health and safety concerns'. Kacey Godfrey, seven, was devastated after being told to hand back her uniform by Girlguiding bosses, who said there were not enough staff to cope with her. Her parents Donna, 36, and Simon, 38, now fear their daughter will lose touch with friends she met in the Rainbows, the Girlguiding group for five to seven-year-olds. Heartbroken: Little Kacey Godfrey gives the Girl Guide salute in her Brownies uniform. Her mother says the child has been left in tears by the ban . 'I think it’s cruel not to let her join just because they say they don’t have enough helpers to supervise her,' said Mrs Godfrey. 'She’s been in Rainbows for years and had no trouble. But after three weeks at Brownies they told us that she can’t be enrolled with all of her friends because of her learning disabilities. 'All it is, is that she struggles a bit with her alphabet and has a reading age two years behind other children her age. 'I think they don’t want to enrol her now as it will be harder to get rid of her later.' Kacey, from Billericay, Essex, joined 3rd Burstead Brownies – for girls aged from seven to ten – last month after her mother had informed the group leader of  her difficulties. 'Out of order': Kacey's mother Donna believes that her daughter's exclusion from Girl Guides is discrimination . But the family later received a call saying she could not attend future meetings. Mrs Godfrey said: 'I was getting Kacey ready for Brownies last week when I received a very abrupt phone call from Julie Nye [Girlguiding UK’s South East Essex County Commissioner]. She told me Kacey would not be allowed to come any more due to health and safety concerns and told me to return her uniform immediately.' The mother of four, whose husband is an area team leader for a home shopping business, added: 'Kacey still wants to go and doesn’t understand why they won’t let her be with her friends. 'They’ve told me they want to talk to the school about her learning disabilities but why does she have to be banned from meetings in the meantime?'

"PUBLISHED: . 15:42 EST, 16 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:57 EST, 16 April 2012 . U.S intelligence officials are trying to confirm reports that Alabama-born Omar Hammami, the leader of an al Qaeda aligned terrorist group, has been beheaded in Somalia. Reports in Somali media have claimed that the al-Shabab jihadist, known as Abu Mansur al-Amriki, or ‘the American’, was beheaded on orders from a rival within the group. Hammami, who grew up in the city of Daphne, Alabama, has been in Somalia for several years and is a prominent recruiter of Americans and western Europeans to al-Shabab, Somalia's most dangerous militant group. Beheaded: U.S intelligence officials are trying to confirm Somali media reports that American born Islamist militant fighter Omar Hamammi has been executed . A U.S intelligence official told Fox News that the terrorist’s death had not been confirmed but said that, if true, it would be a significant turning point in the group’s recruitment operations. 'Our folks have been looking for anything on this.We have not been able to confirm this report,' the official said. Somali media reports claim al-Shabab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane is accused of ordering the execution and, significantly, jihadist forums have posted messages of Hammami's alleged killing. Last month Hammami released a video in which he admitted to fearing for his life saying that members of al-Shabab may kill him over differences of opinion. He appeared in the video, which could not be independently verified, saying he disagreed with his comrades on Islam's Sharia law and strategy. Al-Shabab leader: Last month Hammami released a video saying he feared for his life and that members of terror group al-Shabab may kill him over differences of opinion . It is not the first time that Hammami, the most visible of foreign fighters in the ranks of the al-Shabab, is thought to have been killed. In February last year it was rumoured that he had died in heavy fighting in Mogadishu during the anti-insurgent offensive. Hammami joined the terror group in October 2007 when he was in his early twenties. An Al-Jazeera TV report on the militant group described him as a ‘fighter’ and ‘military instructor’ although he kept his face covered during the filming. There are scant details about what made Hammami go from being a gifted student, president of his Sophomore class who dated the most sought after girl in school, to a key figure in one of the world's most ruthless Islamist insurgencies. Born in 1984, he was brought up as a southern Baptist who went to Bible camp and sang 'Away in a Manger' at Christmas time. His mother was a typical Southern Belle with a distinct Alabama accent and taught at an elementary school. His father came to America from Syria and became an engineer though was said to keep a strict household. Prominent: Hammami's death would be a significant blow for the militant group's western recruitment efforts . Hammami's upbringing was immersed in American culture yet still remained culturally Muslim, shoes were left at the door, Koranic inscriptions decorated the walls, pork was forbidden. As a teenager, his passions fluctuated between Shakespeare and Kurt Cobain, soccer and Nintendo. He had dreams of being a surgeon. Friends in his class said he was a natural leader and compared him to the main character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. His best friend from school told the New York Times: 'It felt cool just to be with him. He was fun to be around. You knew he was going to be a leader.' A decade later that hasn't changed, but he is a leader in a way no one would ever imagine. Terror: New recruits to Somalia's al Shabaab rebel group march during a passing out parade at a military training base in Afgoye, west of the capital Mogadishu, in February 2011 . According to the New York Times it was a trip to Damascus the summer before his sophomore year would make a lasting impression on him. He loved the order of things: how his aunts waited on him, how his male cousins shared a 'cohesiveness of brotherhood'. In photos of the trip, Hammami had traded in his khakis and polo shirts for a long cotton tunic and a prayer cap. A family video shows him bowing to Mecca in prayer one evening. When he got back to Alabama, he was said to be torn between his Christianity and Islam. According to the New York Times, one night before he went to sleep, he turned to God for guidance. He later wrote to his sister: 'Slowly I started to incline toward Islam,  and my heart became tranquil.' He later tried to convert people in his school to Islam, strolled around campus in a red turban and long robe and would defend Osama bin Laden any time he was brought up in class. When 9/11 happened, he became the go to guy for local reporters, according to the New York Times.","Somali media have claimed Omar Hammami has been killed .

For years, officials have denied that exams are getting easier, insisting students have worked hard for their improving grades. Now the head of the UK’s largest examination board has become the latest to cast doubt over A-level and GCSE standards. Rod Bristow, president of Pearson UK, which owns Edexcel, said that boards should be ‘worried’ about the pattern of ever improving results. His comments come just weeks after Glenys Stacey, chief executive of exam regulator Ofqual, admitted that A-levels and GCSEs had suffered ‘persistent grade inflation’ for ‘at least a decade’. Easy deal? But exams are set to get tougher after years of easier tests . Speaking to the Times Educational Supplement, Mr Bristow stopped  short of agreeing there had been grade inflation. But he said: ‘We have seen improvements in grades in GCSEs and  A-levels in the past ten years – that  is indisputable. ‘We have not seen increases in our performance on international benchmarks, nothing to do with rankings – the actual scores haven’t improved. ‘That must tell you that there is an issue we need to look at, to be worried about.’ A report published on Monday by Pearson, which acquired Edexcel in 2005, called for a strict cap to be placed on the number of GCSEs taken by school children amid claims that exam overload was damaging pupils’ education. It said limits should be introduced to ensure pupils sat no more than eight to ten GCSEs. It came after experts warned that teenagers were collecting GCSEs like ‘Scout badges’. The Pearson report also outlined plans for a new generation of tougher A-levels, which ‘set the bar higher’ with longer, essay-style questions. Exam board officials have previously defended standards, insisting that year-on-year grade improvements were due to students’ hard work. However, all the exam boards have come under Government pressure recently after allegations of a ‘cosy collusion’ with schools, including in the running of exam seminars. A newspaper investigation last December revealed how seminars were giving teachers vital information about papers. It also exposed one of the chief examiners at Edexcel boasting about how the board had managed to clear easy exams with Ofqual. Steph Warren, a senior official at Edexcel, told an undercover reporter, posing as a geography teacher considering using the firm’s GCSE exams, that ‘you don’t have to teach a lot’.  Another Edexcel English official boasted about how, thanks to easy coursework, ‘weak kids’ could get through ‘on anything really’. Easy: Ofqual has announced plans to reduce the number of 'soft' subjects on offer and to axe 'F' and 'G' grades . Ofqual recently announced it was banning thousands of exam seminars, which posed ‘unacceptable risks’ to the integrity of the system. Some teachers expected to receive ‘privileged information’ about exams, it claimed. Yesterday, the regulator announced plans to change GCSE grading and reduce the number of ‘soft’ subjects on offer. Discredited ‘F’ and ‘G’ grades are likely to be axed, while dozens of subjects, such as leisure and tourism, and hospitality face being stripped of their GCSE status. Ofqual admitted it was looking at ways of ‘containing’ grade inflation over the next four years.","Head of UK's largest exam board casts doubt over test standards .

A mother who tried to cover up for her son after he killed a pensioner in last summer’s riots was jailed yesterday. Lavinia Desuze, 31, destroyed her son Darrell’s clothes after spotting him in television footage of the looting and vandalism that spread throughout London. Although she knew that the 17-year-old  had killed a man and that police had arrested the wrong person, Desuze callously cut up his clothes and dumped them in a bin to protect him. Darrell Desuze (right),  17, was sentenced to eight years' detention today fro the killing of Richard Mannington Bowes and his mother Lavinia (left) was jailed for 18 months . Richard Mannington Bowes, 68, lies on the floor after the brutal assault which happened after he remonstrated with rioters in Ealing . Yesterday, Desuze, of Hounslow, West .

Outside court yesterday, Anne Wilderspin, Mr Bowes’s sister, said Darrell had committed a ‘terrible crime’. Richard Mannington Bowes was killed when he went to put out a fire near his flat . But she added: ‘I was completely devastated. I feel compassion for this youngster, who was only 16 at the time. ‘He has potentially ruined his life, . or any decent chance of making an honest living in the future. I have . forgiven him, and being a Christian, I pray to Lord Jesus that he will . turn over a new leaf.’ During the trial, prosecutor Brian . Altman QC told the court how Desuze knew her son had been responsible . for Mr Bowes’s death. He added: ‘Unlike others who turned in their own . children, horrified at what they had seen them do, she sought to prevent . him from facing the justice he deserved.’ Mr Justice John Saunders said of . Desuze, who gave birth to Darrell at 14 and raised him as a single . mother: ‘I accept the instinct of a mother to protect her child is a . very powerful one. ‘If she had felt able to admit what . she had done, it would have made it easier to be lenient. Instead she . continued to deny committing any offence and, on the verdict of the . jury, lied on oath.’ The court also heard how 6ft  Darrell . had ‘played a full part in  the violence’ as disorder swept the country . last summer.

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 04:05 EST, 10 January 2012 . A landlord and the woman . 22 years his senior he married to dodge immigration laws were jailed for . a total of six years for running a sham marriage business. Four suitors facing deportation paid Mohammed Tanin, 26, £2,200 each to jet in prospective wives from Portugal. Within a week of their arrival on June 30, 2010, each of the women had applied to the Home Office for permission to marry. Mohammed Tanin and Maria Marques have been found guilty of their part in a visa scam . As European Union citizens, their . automatic right to remain in the UK would also have applied to their . husbands, who were all on student visas, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Tanin's wife, Portugese citizen Maria Marques, 47, told the grooms 'they can cook, they can clean and they can marry you'. The couple's marriage at Bow, East . London, on November 24, 2009, was also a sham to keep Tanin in the . country after his student visa expired. The Bangladeshi  landlord, who owned several . properties in the Poplar area of east London, set up similar schemes for . his Bangladeshi tenants. He also offered to sort out a marriage for Omar Hossain, a work colleague in the catering department at London Zoo. Tanin and Marques denied entering into . a sham marriage and conspiring to arrange four more, but were found . guilty of all charges by unanimous verdicts after a trial last month. Tanin was jailed yesterday for four years and Marques for two years for their parts in the conspiracy. Maria Marques helped bring in the 'brides' from her native Portugal . Sham brides Tama Perpetuo, 24, and Ana . Cunha, 22, who pleaded guilty, were each given 14 day jail terms after . their potential husbands were let off with cautions. Passing sentence, Judge Inigo Bing described the scam as 'fraudulent exploitation of an immigration rule.' He said: 'Every national government has a duty to protect its borders and to control the number of people entering the country. 'In the UK these functions are . exercised in a lawful and transparent way through the Immigration Act . and enforced by the UK Border Agency. 'UK citizens expect those laws are . enforced because confidence in our system of border control is sapped if . it is perceived that foreigners are living here who have not been . permitted to do so. 'An organised conspiracy to breach that law is therefore a serious offence. 'You established a relationship of . some power in respect of some Bangladeshi students and then use that . power to persuade them to begin proceedings to enter into a sham . marriage. 'Such a scheme could not take place without brides and that's where Ms Marques enters the case.' The court heard Perpetuo was heavily pregnant at the time of the marriage application. Giving evidence, Mr Hossain said Tanin had 'tricked' him into paying £2,200 to marry a stranger. He claimed the landlord had borrowed . the cash for a 'business' venture but refused to give it back, instead . offering him one of four women he had flown to the UK to be contract . brides. Mr Hossain, who was facing deportation, applied to marry Maria De Matos just one week after meeting her in June 2010. He filled out a Certificate of . Approval for Marriage application under Tanin's supervision, claiming De . Matos had lived in the country for more than a year. By marrying women from Portugal, whose capital Lisbon is pictured, the men would automatically be allowed to stay in the country . When the Home Office asked for more information, he claimed to have met her in a Central London pub six months previously. Mr Hossain said: 'Tanin said he was . not going to return my money. He said I could take a chance and use my . opportunity to get married to one of these ladies and that way he . wouldn't have to pay me back. 'At that point I realised - he's quite business-minded - it had all been a trick to sell his product.' After their arrival at London Luton . Airport on an Easyjet flight, the brides were all taken to Tanin's . then-home address at East India Dock Road, Poplar. Two of them moved in with their would-be husbands straight away, while the other two stayed with Tanin. But when they applied for their . Certificates of Approval for Marriage, three of them on the same day, . all four were rejected after border officials became suspicious. Michael House, defending Tanin, said: . 'If the scheme had succeeded, the consequence would have been that four . industrious and hard-working young men would have been entitled to stay . in the country. 'Whether that would have been a benefit or a detriment to the country is really an open question. 'Immigration is a very delicate and . controversial subject. A degree of hysteria is sometimes generated, . which can transfer itself into government policy and government . legislation.' Mohammed Tanin, of Willis Street, . Poplar, and Maria Marques, of East India Dock Rd, Poplar, had denied . entering into a sham marriage. They also denied conspiring to arrange . sham marriages between Tama Perpetua, Ana Cunha, Zahirul Islam, Maria . Do Rosario Fonesca and Robiul Amin Johami, Ana Cunha and Khaled Hossain . and Maria de Fatima Ferreira Cabos de Matos and Omar Hossain. The applications for marriage were made in July 2010. Perpetua, of Lodore Street, Poplar, and Cunha, of the same address, admitted conspiracy to arrange their own sham marriages. Atiq Haque, of the specialist crime . directorate, said: 'I think we're impressed with the result and it goes . to show that if people choose to embark on this journey, the . Metropolitan Police will bring them to justice. 'These people exploit the system that's in place and make it more difficult for genuine applicants to stay. 'They put extra pressure on the UK Border Agency by creating extra cases for them to look into.'","Mohammed Tanin and Maria Marques had themselves married as part of visa scam .

A 30-year-old child care worker who died after a routine bowel operation could have survived if doctors had taken her health concerns seriously, a coroner said today. Kirsty Woods died of an infection . just 12 days after her operation at Barnsley Hospital, despite she and her family . expressing their worries about her deteriorating health on a number of occasions. Kirsty Woods, 30, died 12 days after a routine operation. A coroner said she could have survived had her concerns been treated seriously . Miss Wood was admitted to Barnsley Hospital with suspected gastric flu but was subsequently diagnosed with colitis. She had the operation to remove part of her large intestine because it was inflamed. But doctors failed to spot the surgical stitches had ruptured, causing the fatal infection. She died on September 21, 2010 after having a heart attack. Three days before Kirsty was vomiting and hallucinating. Coroner David Urpeth, who recorded a narrative verdict, said: 'These were not taken sufficiently seriously or acted upon appropriately. 'If the peritonitis had been diagnosed earlier Kirsty would have been able to undergo further surgery and would very likely have survived.' Pathologist Dr Kim Suvarna said the childcare worker, who was 'otherwise fit and healthy', could have survived if the infection had been diagnosed earlier. 'She should have walked through this type of surgical procedure easily. 'I’m surprised this degree of inflammation and abdomen catastrophe was not identified and dealt with at an earlier stage.' Kirsty Woods died at Barnsley Hospital on September 21, 2010 . Kirsty, from Penistone, near Barnsley, South Yorks, was admitted to hospital on August 21 after suffering sickness, diarrhoea and pain in her abdomen. Doctors tried treating her with steroids and other medication but when she failed to improve, they decided to operate. Surgeon Theodore Offori said Kirsty had a raised pulse throughout her recovery but peritonitis was never suspected. He said it was ‘debatable’ whether a CT scan should have been done earlier and denied anything should have been done differently. Surgical registrar Christopher Whitfield agreed her heart rate was high but said blood pressure was normal following the operation. When he visited her five days later she complained of pain in her abdomen and was suffering from diarrhoea. He said he thought she was suffering a common side effect to bowel surgery, where the bowel fails to propel or absorb the contents properly. Another doctor flagged up the possibility of a leaking bowel but X- rays showed no signs and were consistent with his diagnosis, he said. He admitted her chances of survival would have improved if the leak had been detected earlier. Miss Woods' father Bernie, 62, who was with son Peter and daughter Kelly at the inquest, described the verdict as bittersweet. He said: 'I’m satisfied as we has proved what we said all along. This could have been prevented. 'After her mum died she was my right hand. She loved her family and she’s really missed.' Medical director Dr Jugnu Mahajan, medical director at the hospital, said he was sorry for their loss. 'We will now carefully consider the coroner’s findings to ensure the chances of a such a tragic event happening again are absolutely minimised,' he said.","Doctors failed to spot Kirsty's surgical stitches had ruptured, causing a fatal infection ."

Patients are suffering because NHS prescription medicines meant for the UK are being sold abroad for profit, a Parliamentary group has warned. Medicine shortages are having an 'adverse' impact on patients, including vulnerable groups such as those with mental health problems, the All-Party Pharmacy Group said. In a report detailing its inquiry into medicine shortages, the group said the shortages had been mainly caused by the export of medicines intended for the UK market to other EU countries. They said the issue had now reached urgent proportions. Shortages: Highly qualified pharmacists are having to spend time locating medicines in short supply, the MPs noted . This exporting is conducted by speculators and is legal under EU and UK law, the report noted. Highly qualified pharmacists are having to spend time locating medicines in short supply, the MPs noted. But in spite of the best efforts of pharmacists, the group said it had been told of cases involving vulnerable patients not receiving the medicine they need because of shortages. These included patients with mental health problems, epilepsy sufferers, diabetics, and even pregnant women in need of medicine to stabilise their pregnancy. 'Evidence we received highlights the stress, anxiety and sometimes harm that patients suffer,' the MPs said in their report. The group warned that the UK has been experiencing shortages of NHS prescription medicines for four years. 'We have no objection to the export of medicines in principle, so long as this practice does not harm patients,' they said. 'However, throughout this inquiry, we have seen evidence that patients are suffering and that pharmacists' time and resources are being diverted away from patient care as a result of medicines being in short supply.' Ronan Brett, Head of Professional and External Relations at Lloydspharmacy said 80 per cent of their pharmacists had been unable to fill four or more prescriptions a week. In its report, the group calls for a 'renewed sense of urgency' to deal with the problem by those organisations involved in the supply of medicine. The Government must 'unequivocally' state that the interests of UK patients must come first and not provisions concerning the free movement of goods, it said. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said patients were being put at risk . Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: 'The very least patients should be able to expect is for prescribed medicines to be available to them when required. 'However, all too often this simple expectation is not being met and as a result patients, some of whom have serious medical conditions that require medicine to remain stable, are being put at risk. 'The Government needs to investigate this problem as a matter of urgency, using the findings of this report as a starting point.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'It is vital that patients get the medicines they need. In the vast majority of cases they do. 'There are nearly 900 million prescriptions dispensed a year, almost 11,000 community pharmacies and some 16,000 medicines so some shortages and delivery delays are inevitable. 'We monitor medicines supply closely and we continue to work closely with representatives of the medicines supply chain to ensure that NHS patients receive the medicines they need. 'We have well established arrangements for dealing with supply issues, to minimise any potential impact on patients. 'Much of this work goes unseen, as difficulties are prevented before they happen. 'We will carefully consider the recommendations the All-Party Pharmacy Group make in their report.' Rob Darracott, chief executive of Pharmacy Voice, which represents community pharmacy owners, said: 'Pharmacists up and down the country are making extraordinary efforts to get medicines to their patients promptly, and in most cases succeeding. 'But there is a long-standing problem with medicines delays which must not be allowed to continue indefinitely. 'Department of Health guidance states that pharmacies should wait no more than 24 hours for supplies of medicines - patients have a right to expect that this very reasonable commitment is met every time. 'This needs to be treated as a firm and enforceable obligation, not just guidance which can be ignored when convenient.' Mr Brett, at Lloydspharmacy said:  'This report does the important job of drawing attention to the significant problem of medicines shortages, which is having a real impact on patient health. 'Our pharmacists have made it clear to us that they are finding it increasingly difficult to get hold of standard, widely prescribed medicines; 80 per cent have been unable to dispense items for four or more prescriptions a week. 'This is particularly concerning when it impacts patients with serious or long term conditions, and in particular vulnerable older patients.'","Speculators can legally export drugs from UK to EU - even if it causes shortages in Britain .

"By . Hugo Gye . UPDATED: . 09:18 EST, 9 September 2011 . MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may be barred from voting on laws which only affect England, as the Government moves to tackle the thorny 'West Lothian question' for the first time. An independent commission will be set up to consider the issue, which was first raised 34 years ago by Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for West Lothian. The question has become more pertinent since the advent of devolution in 1997, when separate administrations were set up for Scotland and Wales. Parliament: MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could be barred from voting on England-only legislation . Since then a large number of policy issues, particularly relating to public services, have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly. English MPs sitting at Westminster have no say over the policies set outside of English borders. However, English policies on issues like education and healthcare are still decided by the UK Parliament, and are voted on by MPs who make up the chamber meaning they can come from all the countries of the Union. In 1977, Tam Dalyell, pictured above, the Labour MP for West Lothian, pointed out that Scottish devolution could mean Scottish MPs voting on English affairs, with English MPs unable to vote on Scottish affairs. In response, controversial right-wing MP Enoch Powell said: 'Let us call it the West Lothian question.' The introduction of Scots and Welsh devolution in 1997 meant that responsibility for many policy areas was taken out of the hands of Westminster, but that MPs from those countries could still vote on purely English issues. Solutions which have been suggested for the problem include the establishment of a purely English parliament, and banning Scottish MPs from votes which do not affect their constituents. However, every possible answer has its drawbacks, and none has been very widely accepted despite it being an issue which has rumbled on for 34 years. Since devolution, there have been growing calls for 'English votes for English laws', so that MPs should no longer be able to vote on laws which will not apply in their consistuencies. The controversial voting issue became particularly heated in 2004, when Labour's policy on top-up fees was passed only with the support of Scottish MPs, even though the controversial policy did not apply in Scotland. Now after 34 years the current Government is determined to take action to end the anomaly. Constitutional reform minister Mark Harper announced in a statement to MPs that a formal proposal for the commission's work, and its terms of references, will be announced soon after Parliament returns from the party conference season. It will be made up of a small group of non-partisan experts with constitutional, legal and parliamentary expertise. Their primary task will be to examine how the Westminster Parliament can 'deal most effectively with business that affects England wholly or primarily, when at the same time similar matters in some or all of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are lawfully and democratically the responsibility of the separate parliament or assemblies,' Mr Harper said. Ministers will consult with Commons Speaker John Bercow and other parliamentary authorities before the launch of the commission, he added. All political parties will be given 'a full opportunity to have their say' following the completion of the commission's work. The commission will not consider the funding of different parts of the UK, nor the balance between English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs in the House of Commons. Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd said: 'England deserves to have its own administration to deal with issues which affect England only. 'This would then ensure that there is a clear distinction between what is a matter for England and what is a matter for other countries too. The lines are too blurred as they are.'","Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs can currently vote on laws which only affect England .

"By . Rebecca Evans and David Wilkes . UPDATED: . 20:59 EST, 22 December 2011 . For 25 years, Nadia Lee has patrolled one of London’s most exclusive boroughs, pushing a deluxe pram laden with tubs of grain. She scattered the seed to attract pigeons, then netted any injured specimens. Those she could not treat on the spot, she gently put in her Gucci and Prada handbags to take back to her £750,000 Georgian maisonette in Pimlico, London, for a spot of homeopathy. But some of Miss Lee’s neighbours were furious about their homes and cars being plastered in pigeon droppings, while there were claims her activities attracted rats and amounted to a health hazard. On a mission: Nadia Lee with a rescued pigeon near her home in Pimlico, London. Yesterday, the bird-lover’s wings were clipped when she received an Anti-Social Behaviour Order, applied for by Westminster Council, preventing her from feeding birds in her local area for the next three years. Privately educated Miss Lee, 64, has been dubbed the ‘Pigeon Lady of Pimlico’. A former secretary and pilot’s daughter, she was known for her elegance and used to drive a Rolls-Royce. However, her mother’s death over two decades ago had a profound effect on her lifestyle and she became a self-styled ‘bag lady’, going through bins. It was at around this time that she began to devote her days to tending to pigeons. She looked bewildered yesterday at Westminster Magistrates’ Court as a prosecutor condemned her ‘prolific pigeon-feeding’. Gillian Crew said it had caused ‘distress, alarm and harassment to her neighbours’, adding: ‘Although she clearly loves animals, we ask that she gives the same sort of consideration to her neighbours.’ Seven residents and two council officials appeared in court to testify against Miss Lee, complaining that they were unable to enjoy the roof terraces and gardens of their  multi-million pound homes because of pigeon droppings. Some claimed that she has even ‘inspired a group of copycat feeders’. One neighbour, Austen Iverleigh, said: ‘She generates squalor on an industrial scale. Upmarket: Miss Lee's £750,000 Georgian home which she has patrolled for a quarter of a century . ‘Whenever I have spoken to her, she has been very polite and I am sure that in any other respect, she is a very nice and reasonable person. ‘The problem is the feeding of pigeons on a huge scale, which causes serious disturbance to those around her. I have seen rats in her basement.’ But Miss Lee, who grew up in Egypt, said: ‘It is nothing to do with the pigeons. ‘People do not like seeing someone who was once successful and elegant turning into a bag lady. ‘I was a functioning, normal tax-paying person until my 40s when my mother died. They used to see me driving a classic Rolls-Royce and wearing cashmere and heels and now they see me going through bins. They don’t like it.’ She told the court she had been feeding birds all of her life as she ‘hates to see suffering of any kind’. She added: ‘You cannot rescue pigeons without putting down seed and getting them all together. I then catch them in a net, which I carry with me everywhere I go. ‘Then I put them in Gucci bags hanging off my Mamas & Papas pram. I take them home and take the string off their feet, rub them in lavender and treat them with homeopathy. ‘If they are too injured, I take them to a pigeon sanctuary. I love them and they depend on me because I have raised them all their lives.’ Richard Paton-Philip, defending, said that 95 local residents had signed a petition supporting her and that she was being targeted for her ‘eccentric nature’. He added: ‘Many residents have lauded her activities, recognising her services to wildlife.’ But District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe said: ‘Miss Lee clearly has a great affinity for birds and she should be allowed to continue to feed them but in an appropriate place such as a park. ‘I see people feeding pigeons when I walk through St James’s Park, and I have to say, I find the sight rather endearing. But pigeon-feeding on this scale and in this street is not acceptable.’ After the Asbo was granted, Miss Lee said: ‘It is such an injustice. They will all die now that I can’t help them. Tending to pigeons is the most important thing in my life, it’s my reason for living and I’ve been doing it for 25 years. ‘I don’t understand why people hate pigeons. They are so brave and clever – 32 were given medals for gallantry during the Second World War. I will try to appeal. Asbos were designed to stop yobs from causing trouble, not to stop a pensioner from throwing a bit of bird seed.’ A dossier compiled by the council contained surveillance photographs and a diary detailing 38 sightings of Miss Lee feeding the birds in the six months before an interim Asbo was made in September. Conditions of the Asbo include banning Miss Lee from feeding the pigeons in the streets around her home in Pimlico or assisting anyone else to do so, and stopping her putting water in a little ditch near her house for them to bathe in. After the two-day hearing, Judge Roscoe ruled that Miss Lee would not have to pay any court costs as her only income is a state pension. Last year Christine Foreman  was given an Asbo by Croydon magistrates after neighbours complained the constant ‘cooing and fluttering of wings’ made their lives ‘a living hell’.","Nadia Lee patrolled streets near her home for 25 years .

A police officer has been reprimanded after tweeting that he had ‘arrested the offenders’ over the attack of a 94-year-old woman in her bed. Great-grandmother Emma Winnall was found unconscious and covered in blood when carers came to check on her on Tuesday morning last week. She had a fractured skull, a broken arm and wrist and a partially severed finger. The beating was so severe that the frail widow's palms were bruised from her attempts to protect herself, while blood had splattered on to the walls behind her bed. Battered: Emma Winnall was assaulted as she slept at her home in Moseley, Birmingham, some time between 9pm on April 30 and 9am the next morning. West Midlands Police said a woman, 56, and a man, 28, were arrested at their home in the Hall Green area of Birmingham just before 6.30am on suspicion of assault. They have been taken to a police station in the West Midlands. But PC Sanghar, who uses the name PC0318HSANGHAR, then tweeted: ‘Folks. I am happy to now tell you that I was part of the team today who arrested the offenders who assaulted Emma Winnall.’ An hour later he added: ‘Folks the arrest is brilliant but guilty by suspicion (as per law) so we still need help please from all of you.’ West Midlands Police last night apologised and said the tweets by PC Hanif Sanghar were 'wholly inappropriate'. Chief Inspector Sally Seeley from West Midlands Police, said: ‘The man and woman arrested in connection with the attack on Emma Winnall are suspects. They are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. 'Like most people, the officer who tweeted about his role in the double arrest, was shocked by the violent nature of the attack on Mrs Winnall and was keen to update people with the latest development in the case. Mrs Blencoe and her brother John Winnall make their public appeal for information . ‘It is clear that in doing this, he used terminology which was wholly inappropriate. ‘The officer has been advised and the tweets removed. We apologise for any confusion or distress his comment caused.’ Mrs Winnall’s son John yesterday told how his mother would probably never return to her home. Mr Winnall, from Birmingham, added: ‘My mum is not very well today but she was better last week. ‘I doubt she will go home now. She will probably go to a care home or something when she leaves hospital. ‘She was saying to me last week that she doesn't want to go home because she doesn't think she would be able to sleep. We are all just thankful she is safe and alive.' Crimestoppers offered a £5000 cash reward in a move backed by West Midlands Police. Mrs Winnall, who lives in Moseley, Birmingham, worked at the city’s small arms factory during the Second World War. She relies on a wheelchair to get around, and has lived alone since her husband Frank died in 2006, aged 91. She has five children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, some of whom have been by her side in hospital since the assault.

Better prevention: Cancer death rates have dropped significantly thanks to better screening for different types of the disease such as breast cancer . Cancer death rates in Britain have dropped to the lowest in 40 years thanks to more people quitting smoking and better screening. Tens of thousands of people are now beating the disease every year as the disease is caught earlier and patients receive treatment at earlier stages. Deaths rates for cancer sufferers aged between 50 and 59 have dropped 40 per cent from 310 for every 100,000 people in 1971 to 185 two years ago, according to Cancer Research UK. And since 1971, deaths for the 50 to . 59 group have gone from more than 21,000 a year to less than 14,000 in . 2010 out of the 43,100 people of that age group diagnosed with cancer. In . total 309,500 new cases are diagnosed across all age groups each year . with 76,000 patients dying from the disease every year. Professor . Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician said: 'Our latest . figures show that for the first time in the last four decades cancer . deaths among people aged 50-59 have dropped below 14,000 a year. 'The reduction in people smoking has been a big help, and we are also better at diagnosing cancers early and better at treating them whether by surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy.' Breakthrough drugs credited with helping slash death rates include tamoxifen, which is a hormone therapy mainly used to treat breast cancer. The biggest falls in death rates among men were for stomach cancer, which fell by 83 per cent. This was followed by Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Testicular cancer. The biggest fall for women was cervical cancer, which fell by 80 per cent, followed by stomach cancer and Hodgkin's Lymphoma. How premature cancer deaths have fallen . Someone in Britain is diagnosed with cancer every two minutes while more than one in three will develop some form of the disease in their lifetime. There are more than 200 types of cancer but 40 per cent of all cancers are preventable if people make a few simple changes to their lives to minimise the risk. These include doing more exercise, eating more fresh fruit and vegetables and less red meat, reducing alcohol intake, and keeping weight down and not smoking. Dr Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK’s chief executive, said: 'There is still so much more to do.  Smoking remains the largest cause of cancer which is why Cancer Research UK is petitioning the government to bring in plain packaging of tobacco so children are less likely to be seduced by the sophisticated marketing techniques designed to make smoking attractive to youngsters.'

As he explored his own back garden, a scrap of pottery protruding from the dirt caught Dr Owen Johnson's eye. When the hospital worker tried to dig it out, it cracked open - spilling out a stream of gold and silver coins 'like a slot machine'. Dr Johnson, 53, was inspecting a hole dug by builders at his home, in the village of High Ackworth, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire. Token of love: The gold ring found among the hoard bears the romantic inscription 'When you see this, remember me' The haul of Civil War currency could be worth as much as £51,000 - but the doctor has had to hand it all in to the Government. Just under 600 coins dating from around the 1640s were found, as well as a stunning gold ring bearing the romantic inscription 'When this you see, remember me'. Studies showed the find, with individual coins to the value of just over £85, was located near what looked like an old post, and could have been stashed underground by a Royalist who feared it would be looted by Roundhead troops. Speaking outside Wakefield Coroner’s . Court, where an treasure trove inquest ruled the find belongs to the . state, Dr Johnson said he had taken the day off from Pinderfields . Hospital when he made the amazing discovery last July. Dr Johnson, who lives with wife Barbara, 55, and daughters Pippa, 22, Tembe, 21, and Lucy, 17, said: 'At first I thought the coins were some sort of toy, then we started having a closer look at them. The gold ones looked like they had just come out of a museum, and the ring is beautiful. 'It was then we started to realise this was something significant. It was very exciting and we just stood there for a long time looking at it.' Council bosses in Wakefield are now hoping they can secure the historic hoard for display at Pontefract Museum. Dr Johnson said: 'Pontefract Museum is very interesting but it could do with some highlights and this would definitely be a highlight, which would be good because Pontefract’s history is sometimes undervalued.' Digging it: Dr Johnson, 53, is pictured with his wife Barbara and daughter Pippa at the treasure inquest in Wakefield. He will now have to wait to find out whether he is entitled to compensation for his discovery . Lisa Dodd, Wakefield Council’s service director for sport and culture, added: 'We believe these items have been in our district since the 1600s, making them a real part of this district’s rich history. 'It would be a great shame to not do all we can to try and keep the treasure in its rightful home for future generations to enjoy. 'The Wakefield district has a superb, nationally renowned heritage and Pontefract Museum would be a fitting home for the treasure. 'It would be yet another major attraction for visitors and contribute directly to the rich history of the area. It would also support the new Pontefract Castle development.' The council will now wait for a valuation, after which it will be decided whether Dr Johnson will get any compensation. The hoard is more than 300 years old and so is covered by the Treasure Act of 1996. Overthrown: King Charles I . When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent. His was a style of governance defined by religious dogma and a stubborn opposition to parliamentary rule. This bred feelings of alienation and deep mistrust in pockets of England, while in Scotland tensions with the English boiled over into bloody conflict. The embattled king was forced to form a parliament in 1640, and within this a vocal and highly critical Puritan faction began to grow. When a violent Catholic rebellion broke out in Ireland, disagreements over how to respond split England in two, and in 1642 the English Civil War broke out. The Royalists, based largely in the north and west, fought for the king, while the Roundheads, also known as Parliamentarians, came mainly from the south and east. They took their nickname from their preference for closely cropped hair, which set them apart from the ringlets of courtly Royalists. The battles that followed saw Charles's forces, bolstered by the Welsh and Cornish, clash with a Roundhead army swollen with Londoners. The Royalists looked to be on the brink of victory in 1643, until their enemies joined forces with the Scots. In 1644, the king's men suffered a crushing defeat at Marston Moor, North Yorkshire, effectively conceding the north. A further loss at Naseby, Northamptonshire, was the final nail in the coffin. The king gave himself up to the Scots and they promptly passed him on to their Roundhead allies, who were in the early stages of establishing a republican regime. He was executed in 1649, but not before inciting further clashes known as the Second Civil War.","Dr Owen Johnson also found a gold ring bearing the inscription: 'When you see this, remember me'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:59 EST, 13 February 2012 . Tragic: Dartmouth student Crispin Scott, 20, was found dead in a Barcelona apartment on January 7 while studying abroad in Barcelona . A 41-year-old Spanish landlord was arrested Wednesday in conjunction with the death of Dartmouth student Crispin Scott, a 20-year-old math major who was studying abroad. Though early autopsy results suggested that the Seattle native died from an accidental drug overdose, new evidence shows a massive amount of a powerful barbiturate in his system. The landlord oversaw the same apartment complex in Barcelona where Scott’s body was discovered in January. According to Spanish newspaper El Periodico, police searched the apartment where Scott was found, as well as another apartment in Barcelona during the arrest. The officers found shocking photographs of young people – in the two dozen pictures recovered, many of them were naked or scantily clad. According to reports, police believe the suspect in custody drugged the subjects with tranquilisers and sleeping pills. El Periodico notes that in 2009, the landlord in question had a complaint filed against him by a young man who accused him of violating him after feeding him sleeping pills against his will. Sources told the paper that police are investigating the possibility that this man is a ‘serial rapist.’ Scott’s parents, Pat and Norm, told student paper The Dartmouth that they have faith in the Spanish court system to ‘handle this case carefully.’ He was participating in the Academy of Liberal and Beaux-Arts program through Portland State University. At Dartmouth, the 20-year-old math major also played on the rugby team, the student paper reported in January. In Spain: Crispin Scott was studying abroad in Barcelona, Spain; the landlord was arrested in a suburb outside of the city, in Esplugues de Llobregat . University: Crispin Scott was part of Dartmouth's Class of 2013, was majoring in mathematics, and played rugby for the school . According to The Dartmouth, the program had not officially started by the time of Scott’s death, a point to which the program’s coordinator Charles Inman is aggravated. ‘It seems like (the police) don’t feel a need to let us into the loop just because he hadn’t started our program yet,’ Mr Inman told the paper. 'As devastated as we are by the loss of . our beloved Crispin, the circumstances surrounding his senseless death . add to the immense pain for us and others who cared so much for him.' -Crispin Scott's parents Pat and Norm Scott . Reports say that Scott was out with several friends on the night of his death before the official start of his study-abroad program. He failed to return to his apartment the night of January 6, and remained missing at noon on January 7 for the program’s orientation luncheon, Mr Inman told CNN. Mr Inman told The Dartmouth that the remaining 60 Dartmouth students studying in the city under the ALBA program have not been formally notified of the arrest. ‘We don’t want to do things by email – that seems shallow,’ he said, noting that many students have likely seen the story on the Internet. Scott’s parents said in a statement: ‘As devastated as we are by the loss of our beloved Crispin, the circumstances surrounding his senseless death add to the immense pain for us and others who cared so much for him.’ The Ecuadorian man was arrested in the Esplugues de Llobregat suburb of Barcelona, a police statement released Saturday said.","Crispin Scott, 20, found dead on January 7 in Spain .

More than 1,000 new jobs are to be created after Nissan announced plans to build a new hatchback at its UK plant. The decision to invest £127million in the UK economy by building a new medium-sized model in Sunderland in 2014, was trumpeted as a ‘big vote’ of confidence in the British car industry. This boost follows an announcement, last month, by the Japaneses car giant that its North East plant will also produce a compact car based on the so-called . Invitation concept model from next year. Boost: Prime Minister David Cameron, center left, spoke to Nissan Motors employees at the company's global headquarters, after the car giant announced it will invest £126million to build a new hatchback in Britain . It is estimated the two new projects will create more than 3,000 extra jobs in the region. Speaking to BBC’s Breakfast programme, Kevin Fitzpatrick, Nissan’s vice-president for manufacturing in the UK, said: ‘It’s over 1,000 jobs so it is significant for the region. ‘We’ve just announced the fourth new model to be launched between now and 2014. This will put the plant on a 24-hour running so it does secure a lot of jobs. It’s a big vote from the parent company. ‘It’s too early for the new car to be named or to give any technical details. But it will be a C-segment hatchback so it will be in direct competition with the Ford Focus and Vauxhall Astra. ‘It’s a big vote for the car industry. We’re not the only one to have a lot of positive announcements lately. ‘The car industry in the UK is pretty buoyant at the moment, particularly the companies which have strong products and strong export markets.’ Success: Nissan's UK Manufacturing Vice President Kevin Fitzpatrick, bottom right, pictured with Nissan staff and the One Millionth Nissan Qashqai to come off the production line, said the announcement of major new investment was a 'big vote' of confidence in the British car industry . Nissan’s two new models will result in . the jobs boost for the UK automotive sector within . the next two years - 625 at Nissan and the remainder across the supply . base. Once recruitment for . both models is complete, the Sunderland plant’s workforce will stand at a . record 6,225, supporting annual production of more than half a million . models. Nissan said the new hatchback, which . will be named closer to its sales launch, marks the car-maker’s return . to the mainstream medium segment in Europe and will play a major role in . the company’s continued expansion. The . announcement was made by Prime Minister David Cameron and Nissan chief . operating officer Toshiyuki Shiga, during a visit to Nissan’s . headquarters in Yokohama, Japan. Around . 80,000 of the new hatchback model will be built annually, triggering . the need for the Sunderland plant to launch an additional shift. This will see both of the factory’s . production lines operating around the clock for the first time in the . plant’s 26-year history, a move which will take manufacturing capacity . beyond 550,000 units. The announcement also consolidates Sunderland’s position as the UK’s largest car manufacturer, a title it has held since 1998. In . 2010 Sunderland became the first UK car plant to produce more than . 400,000 models in a single year when 423,000 Qashqais, Notes and Jukes . rolled off the line. The . record was beaten last year when 480,000 cars were produced, and Nissan . said the plant was preparing to pass the half-million mark for the first . time. Vote of confidence: More than 1,000 jobs are set to be created at Nissan's factory in Sunderland and the surrounding area when the Japanese car giant begins building a new hatchback at its UK plant . Nissan is investing . an additional £127 million in its Sunderland operation, supported by an . offer of £8.2 million from the Government’s Regional Growth Fund. Mr Shiga said: ‘In Europe, Nissan has . achieved record growth in recent years by providing innovative, . customer-focused models like Qashqai and Juke that are designed, . developed and produced within the region. ‘Nissan . already produces more vehicles in Europe than any other Asian . manufacturer and the model announced today will bring world-class . quality and leading technology to our customers at the heart of the . European C-segment. ‘I would . also like to thank the UK Government for its strong and sustained . support which allows us to continue making significant, long-term . investment in our Sunderland operation.’ Mr .

Positive: Prime Minister David Cameron, right, pictured speaking to British employees at Nissan headquarters during a trade visit to the Far East today, welcomed the announcement of added investment in the UK economy . ‘Nissan’s investment in the UK is a huge vote of confidence in the skills and flexibility of the UK workforce. We want to attract more investment like this and that’s why we’re encouraging foreign companies with incentives like the Regional Growth Fund.’ Nissan built the Sunderland plant in 1984 and production began in 1986, with total investment set to reach £3.5 billion. More than 6.5 million cars have been built at the factory, with 80per cent of production exported to 97 world markets.

Normally, Rebecca Jordan will take all the free TV exposure she can get for the psychiatric hospital that she's turned into a tourist attraction known as the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum. SyFy's Ghost Hunters. Travel Channel's Ghost Adventures and Ghost Stories. Discovery's Forgotten Planet. She even hosted an episode of CMT's My Big Redneck Wedding on the 307-acre grounds. But she drew the line when producers for A&E's Paranormal State called. They didn't want to meet the ghosts behind the two-and-a-half foot thick walls, she says. They wanted to get rid of them. Monumental structure: The Trans Allegheny Lunatic Asylum is now a popular tourist spot . A piece of history: Construction began in 1858, but the first patients weren't admitted until 1864, around when this photo was taken . TV magnet: SyFy's Ghost Hunters, Travel Channel's Ghost Adventures and Ghost Stories, Discovery's Forgotten Planet, and CMT's My Big Redneck Wedding all filmed at the asylum . 'And I was like, 'Well, maybe you're not the right fit for me. We do not want to get rid of our spirits! We want them to stay in the building!' 'Unless they want to go home,' she adds with a laugh. 'And then they can go home. I'm not trying to keep anybody here who doesn't want to be here.' Spirits, after all, make money. And the property that Jordan's father bought three years ago for $1.5million is now generating enough revenue from overnight public ghost hunts at $100 a person and other types of tours to pay a staff of 33 and fund a never-ending list of maintenance and repair projects. The main Gothic Revival building is one of the world's largest hand-cut sandstone structures and a National Historic Landmark. Virginia legislators authorized its construction in 1858, but it wasn't until 1864 that the first patients were admitted. Master of the house: Rebecca Jordan serves as operations manager of the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum. Her father bought the property at auction for $1.5million . Not so calming: Rebecca Jordan stands next to a 'tranquilizing chair,' which was used for patients . New and improved: The Jordan family now runs the former psychiatric hospital as an historic and paranormal tourist attraction . The hospital repeatedly changed hands during the Civil War, ending up with West Virginia when it became a separate state. Originally intended for 250 patients, it housed nearly ten times that many during the 1950s. Known in later years as Weston Hospital, it eventually closed in 1994, when the state moved patients to a more modern facility. 'If you love architecture and you love . history and you love the paranormal, you're going to love that building, . and that's just all there is to it.' -Operations manager Rebecca Jordan . Then it stood empty for nearly 15 years, inhabited only by rats, security guards and the occasional paintball-playing trespasser. In 2008, Jordan's father Joe, a Morgantown asbestos abatement and demolition contractor, bought it at auction for $1.5million. He's since sunk at least another $1million into the place, hiring crew after crew to repair the showpiece clock tower, the disintegrating floors and the forever-leaking roofs. Running the asylum is a family affair. Rebecca handles marketing and sales. Her historian husband applies for grants. Her brother handles advertising and maintains the website. Crumbling: The Jordans have invested more than $1million in renovating the ageing building . Hair parlour? Many of the rooms hold relics from days gone by . Haunting: Tourists come to the asylum in part because of its paranormal activity . Her 13-year-old daughter, Breonna Childress, is a full-time volunteer who hosts overnight birthday-party ghost hunts with her friends and talks about the day she'll inherit the business. Mainly by capitalizing on public interest in the paranormal, the Jordans have lured more than 115,000 visitors to the property since they bought it. Chris Richards, director of the Lewis County Convention and Visitors Bureau, calls the following 'phenomenal,' noting that people are traveling from all over the world to visit Weston. The Jordans and local hotels co-sponsor each other, and the operators of gas stations, convenience stores and restaurants all tell Richards that business is up. 'We're all tickled to death that someone is in there and using the space and bringing its back to its heyday and letting it be all it can be,' she says. 'If you love architecture and you love history and you love the paranormal, you're going to love that building, and that's just all there is to it.' Part of the neighbourhood: The hospital is in Weston, West Virginia and stands out from the modest houses . Passing the time: The recreated patient common area shows a card table and several sitting areas . Archaic: A display describes how hydrotherapy treatment was used on patients . Not that there aren't critics. Some mental health advocates were outraged by the name change, and still are. 'I still think it is inappropriate to capitalize on the sad history of that place and to promote the stereotypes that are attached often to mental illness,' says Ann McDaniel, executive director of the Statewide Independent Living Council. 'There's enough fear out there about people who have mental illness. We don't have to make it scary. On display: Artwork, which was created by former psychiatric patients, is displayed at the museum . 'It sensationalizes,' Ms McDaniel says. 'If they were just educating people, that would be good. But when you have haunted houses ... when you have trails called the 'Psycho Path,' that kind of thing is negative.' About once every six months, Rebecca Jordan gets a call from someone concerned about the name. 'And then they book!' she says. 'So who cares?' Abandoned and decaying: The hospital was deserted in 1994 and left empty for 15 years . Spooky scary: Paranormal enthusiasts flock to the creepy former asylum from an era of often archaic medical treatment . The Jordan family has experience with mental health issues, she says, and its exhibits educate people on treatments once considered state of the art and now considered horrifying - electroshock therapy, lobotomies, cold-water baths and cage-like cribs that were hung from the ceiling, to name just a few. The seven museum rooms also feature more than 120 pieces of artwork - pottery, paintings, quilts - that patients made in therapy. Disassembled for the winter, when the building is cold and damp, the displays include the superintendent's books, nurses' logs and more. The asylum is working with West Virginia University to create an interactive exhibit featuring story boards, photos and recorded interviews with former patients and staff. And the museum is a popular stop with not only junior high and high school history classes, but also nursing and abnormal psychology students. Pretty as a picture: A postcard painted a more pleasant picture of the hospital . 'Primarily, there were people here who were trying to make it better for the mentally ill,' Ms Jordan says. 'But there were still people who believed in what they called 'thump therapy' ... and that's just the people who came in angry and would just beat the patients. Unfortunately, that did happen.' The key to the Jordans' success so far has been a diversity of offerings, from Civil War and hospital history tours, to 'mud bogs' for four-wheelers and trucks, and a 25-band Moonstruck Music Festival. It hosts year-round paranormal tours and ghost hunts, even inviting TV celebrities to give seminars and lead special private hunts. Ms Jordan says the asylum is making about $600,000 or $700,000 a year now, but she still doesn't take a salary, and every dollar goes back into the business. Old town: A drawing from 1900 shows the hospital as the prominent landmarks in the town of Weston, West Virginia . 'And I'm fine with that,' she says. 'As long as we're able to keep the building open.' At the end of October, her payroll totalled about $161,000. But maintenance expenses were more than $295,000 — and that was before the wintertime shutdown and the ramping-up of repairs. And so she adds attractions, with an eye to running a year-round business in 2012. In the spring, she'll open three new museum rooms, plus a Macabre Museum 'with all the oddities, all the strange stories' in the basement. Ms Jordan's also working with bus companies on a 'Kooky Christmas' and dinner-theatre tour that will keep people coming through next winter. But she faces on expensive hurdle: The unheated building is frigid, colder inside on a rainy December day than it is outside. Employee Eric Skinner leans over and fake-whispers in Jordan's ear. 'If you heat it,' he tells her, 'they will come.'","Psychiatric hospital built in 1858 and abandoned in 1994 now brings in thousands of tourists annually .

'People need to realise that harassment is a criminal offence and can cause huge distress whether carried out on Facebook or elsewhere.' Living in fear: It is estimated one in three youngsters will be cyber-bullied at some point . Manchester schoolgirl Kate Dipper has told how she was left ‘with no escape’ when bullies began to target her both at school and online - and how she bounced back with the help of a life-saving mentoring programme. The 16-year-old, who lives in Stockport, said: 'It started with a small group saying that I had looked stupid and evil when I was younger, and who would want to be in my family. Then it went round the whole school. I couldn’t understand why they were doing it. It made me feel sad and angry because there was no escape.' Warning: Greater Manchester Police's chief constable Peter Fahy, pictured, says his force receives at least ten calls per day from Facebook-bullied children . But Kate’s story is by no means unusual, according to charity ChildLine. They say cyber-bullying is behind 11 per cent of all thousands of calls they receive. The head of ChildLine has blamed . social networking sites such as Facebook for fuelling what the charity . claims is a huge rise in the number of children who deliberately harm . themselves. Data from hospitals reveals a 68 per cent increase in the number of under-24s admitted for ‘self-inflicted injuries’. Sue Minto said the internet and mobile phones meant young  people were being exposed to cyber-bullying 24 hours a day. Launching . a self-harm awareness campaign last month, which is being supported by X Factor . judge Tulisa Contostavlos, Mrs Minto said such pressure could cause . children to begin cutting themselves or engage in risky behaviour such . as drinking or using drugs. Research suggests the number of children . and young people who deliberately hurt themselves on a regular basis . has risen significantly over the past ten years. Facebook say they do they all they can to protect their members. 'Nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of the people who use the site. Unfortunately, one person determined to harass another will find ways to do so, both online and offline,' a spokesman said. 'On Facebook there are a number of measures people can use to stay safe. We encourage people to use our reporting tools, accessible across the entire site, use our blocking tools to prevent unwanted contact, and visit our Safety Centre, which contains tips about how to use Facebook as safely as possible. 'Facebook operates a ""real name"" policy to ensure people are accountable.'","In Manchester alone, at least ten children phone 999 asking for help every 24 hours ."

But after a judge denied 'Manhattan Madam' Anna Gristina bail for the third time today, the only thing she could do was mouth the words 'I love you' to her husband Kelvin Gorr as she was led away in handcuffs. Instead of being with her family, the 44-year-old will spend tonight behind bars again after a judge told her she is still considered a 'flight risk'. Dressed all in black, her toyboy husband showed up in court to support his wife and was sitting in the public gallery as the judge denied her bail again. Third appearance: Anna Gristina, centre, with attorneys Gary Greenwald, left, and Elise Rucker, right, as she appears in State Supreme Court today to be denied bail . Standing by his woman: Kelvin Gorr, husband of Anna Gristina, who has been charged with promoting prostitution, shows up at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan today as his wife is denied bail again . Plain Jane: Her husband Kelvin Gorr took her new clothes to wear for her third court appearance but even in the black and white dress she looked far from the multimillion-dollar brothel madam she is alleged to be . The relationship between her and . former lawyer Peter Gleason was also questioned today as her new . criminal defense attorney Gary Greenwald took over the case. Gleason had offered his $2.5 million . loft for Anna Gristina's bond, saying his client doesn't have 'two . nickels to rub together' and also invited the 44-year-old and her family . to move in, with the 'madam' being placed under house arrest. Judge Juan Merchan, who is hearing the case, said he won't decide today on the unusual bail proposal. Gristina . intends to file a new application 'as soon as possible' to get out of . her isolation cell at the grim Riker's Island prison. It comes as prosecutors submitted court papers that highlight the 'murky' relationship between Gristina and Gleason. In . a seven-page brief, prosecutors question the lawyer's request to put up . his own $2.5 million Tribeca loft to secure Gristina’s release from . prison and his offer to put the family up in his home. Suspicions: The relationship between Peter Gleason and Anna Gristina is questioned by prosecutors as he announced today he is no longer representing her . According to the New York Daily News, . the Manhattan prosecutors wrote to the judge: 'The arrangement would . also be fraught with potential problems. For example, Mr Gleason might . find that the defendant and her family are unpleasant house guests and . want them to leave. 'He . may also learn facts as a result of sharing living space with the . defendant that prevent him from advancing certain arguments on her . behalf.' They . also noted that his public statements about his client so far 'paint a . murky picture of the nature of his relationship with the defendant'. 'Mr . Gleason also stated that he did not care whether the defendant was . guilty or innocent, a sentiment one might expect from a close friend, . but less so from one’s defense counsel,' the papers said. Gleason also said today he's no longer representing Gristina, but the housing offer still stands. Her new criminal defense lawyer is Gary . Greenwald - who represented mobster Vincent 'Chin' Gigante. Meanwhile, it has emerged that DNA . evidence from the Upper East Side 'brothel' may reveal the identities of . the wealthy and powerful clients who were entertained there by . high-class hookers. On the same day as police busted the . pig-lover while she was meeting with a Morgan Stanley banker - who has . since been put on leave - Manhattan DA investigators raided her 78th . Street apartment and removed several items, including toothbrushes and . hairbrushes, which are considered 'vital evidence'. 'They could potentially be used for DNA . testing, hair analysis to identify people who have been using that . location,' Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Roper told Judge Juan Merchan last . month as she asked him to sign off a search warrant, according to court documents obtained by The New York Post. New Representation: Attorney Gary Greenwald leaves State Supreme Court after representing Anna Gristina, following her previous lawyer Peter Gleason stepping down . Accused of providing pricey prostitutes for 15 years and touting ties to . law enforcement, Gristina has been held on $2million bond since her . February arraignment. Prosecutors have said her wealthy clients could . help her flee the country to protect themselves, and they suggest the British citizen may . have money hidden away for such purposes. The DNA evidence from the seized items may be used to identify some of New York's elite who frequented the brothel, which are said to include politicians, hedge funders, CEOs and even royalty. So far, Gristina has refused to give up . information about her wealthy clients to investigators despite hours of grilling and demands she identify suspects from a list. She told the Post how a revolving team . of investigators, each increasingly higher in rank, showed her a list of . about ten names and demanded she told them what they needed. The 44-year-old told the New York Post in an interview from Rikers Island prison: 'I'd rather bite my tongue off before I tell you anything.' She also insisted she had no hidden stash of money or had made millions of dollars from any prostitution empire, as has been alleged. New York: The DA's office raided the 'brothel at  304 East 78th Street on the day Gristina was arrested . Double life: The suburban home Gristina and . Kelvin Gorr live in with their son Nicholas and their pigs and dogs in . Monroe, upstate New York, was also raided the day she was arrested . Gleason said on Wednesday about his unusual proposal that he'd admired people who 'were defined as much as . by what they were willing to risk as by what they accomplished', and . he'd made the offer in that spirit. 'There are ethical concerns,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Charles Linehan told a court on Monday. State Supreme Court Justice Merchan said he didn't think there was . an ethics problem but wanted to explore the issue further. While not unheard-of, it's certainly unconventional for lawyers to post . bail for clients. Gristina, and co-defendant Jaynie Baker, 30, have pleaded not guilty . to promoting prostitution. Their lawyers have said they were working . together to start a business as matchmakers, not madams. Baker was released on Tuesday on $100,000 bond after turning herself in following three weeks on the run. She appeared in court looking chic and sophisticated to plead not guilty to the charge.

Anote Tong, the Kiribati . president, has announced he is in talks with Fiji to buy . up to 5,000 acres of land on for his citizens to live on. Migration: A group of commuters makes its way home after work in Kiribati - the tide has started to reach the villages and homes of the people that live on top of the 33 flat coral islands that make up the Kiribati islands . The islands of Kiribati atoll in the Pacific Ocean are disappearing as water levels rise . The move could be the world's first . climate-induced migration of recent times. All of the islands, bar one are atolls - ring-shaped islands with central lagoons -  and of the 33 atolls of Kiribati, 21 are inhabited. But some of them already under water and most of its 113,000 people are crammed on to a chain of tiny spaces of land curving around a lagoon. 'This is the last resort, there's no way out of this one,' Mr Tong explained, reported the Telegraph. Kiribati President Anote Tong has announced he is in talks with Fiji to buy up to 5,000 acres of land on for his citizens to live on . Our people will have to move as the tides have reached our homes and villages.' The president said skilled workers will be to sent to Fiji first, so they could fit in easily with the country's population and provide a positive contribution to the economy. 'They need to find employment, not as . refugees but as immigrant people with skills to offer, people who have a . place in the community, people who will not be seen as second-class . citizens,' he told the state-run Fiji One television channel. The land Kiribati wants to purchase is understood to be on Vanua Levu, which is Fiji's second largest island. In recent years, Mr Tong has been desperate to find a solution to the problem of the rising sea level. Last year he looked at the possibility of constructing man-made islands similar to oil rigs for his people to live on. An Education for Migration programme, has been launched, aimed to make the citizens more attractive as skilled migrants. Kiribati youngsters study for degrees at the University of the South Pacific, which is based in the Fijian capital of Suva. Many islanders are concerned that their culture may disappear with the population migration. Formerly known as the Gilbert Islands, the country won independence from the United Kingdom in 1979.

Fiji: The land President Kiribati wants to purchase is understood to be on Vanua Levu - which is Fiji's second largest island . Kiribati used to lie either side of . the International Date Line, but in 1995 the government moved the line . eastwards, ensuring it was the same in the whole country. This meant Kiribati was the first inhabited place on Earth to greet the new millennium on 1 January 2000.

'Invisible Woman': Methodist minister Sara Cliff (pictured) has quit her post as councillor for Lincoln East after fierce protests from residents that she lived 100 miles away from the ward . A Methodist minister who received £23,000 as a councillor for a deprived area while living more than 100 miles away has resigned in the face of fierce opposition from residents. Months after being elected as a Tory councillor for the area of Lincoln East, Reverend Sara Cliff moved to upmarket Soham, 119 miles away in Cambridgeshire. Mrs Cliff, 46, turned up to council sessions in Lincolnshire just 19 times in three years. She was paid an average of £1,200 in allowances per session. With the meetings lasting two and a half hours, it means she was paid almost £500 an hour for the job. After details of her absences and allowances emerged last week, Mrs Cliff faced angry calls to resign, with critics labelling her the ‘Invisible Woman’. And yesterday, the Methodist minister finally confirmed she would resign – although she attacked the ‘unwarranted hostility’ she feels forced her hand. The news was welcomed by members of the local community, who said it was ‘about time’ they could elect someone who would better represent them. Local resident Fran Paterson, 53, said: ‘She should have resigned as soon as she moved over 100 miles away. She was never going to be able to represent our community and she knew it. ‘It’s a disgrace that it took so many people to complain for her to eventually go.’ Labour county councillor John Hough added: ‘She should have resigned a long time ago. ‘It’s a shame it took the publicity for her to make the decision. ‘But it’s the right decision and it’s about time that the people in Lincoln East had proper representation.’ Distant: Two months after being elected, Mrs Cliff moved 119 miles away to the upmarket town of Soham to take a job as a Methodist minister . Mrs Cliff was elected in May 2009 to Lincolnshire County Council as the representative for Lincoln East, one of the most deprived areas in the country. Two months later, she moved 119 miles away to Soham to take a job as a Methodist minister but refused to quit as councillor. As well as attending eight full county council sessions, records show she went to meetings of the Strategic Planning Scrutiny Sub Committee. In her three years, she sat on just 11 out of a total of 37 meetings of this committee. Council records show Mrs Cliff sat in on six of a possible eight committee meetings in 2009. Infrequent visitor: Lincolnshire County Council's headquarters. In her three years, Mrs Cliff sat on just 11 out of a total of 37 meetings of the Strategic Planning Scrutiny Sub Committee . She went on to attend just four of a possible 17 in 2010 and sat in on just one meeting last year. This year she relinquished any committee responsibilities. She did not spend a penny of her £2,000 community budget last year. Among those calling for her resignation last week was Rob Parker, the Labour leader of the council. He said: ‘She’s the invisible woman. She was missing at this year’s budget meeting when huge cuts were brought in which will affect the people she represents. ‘Her ward is one of the most deprived in the country but she wasn’t there to speak up for her constituents.’ Last night, Mrs Cliff said: ‘I have taken the decision to resign my position from the county council. ‘While I did feel willing and able to carry on representing the people of Lincoln East, in view of the unwarranted hostility I am clear that this action is in the best interests of the Methodist church, the county council and my own family.’","Minister Sara Cliff, 46, elected for Lincoln East in 2009 .

A Swiss couple kidnapped by the Pakistani Taliban eight months ago today claimed to have escaped after showing up at a military checkpoint in the north-west of the country. Olivier David Och, 31, and Daniela Widmer, 29 were captured while travelling by camper van in Pakistan's volatile south-west region and had been held on the Afghan border. But today they were celebrating their freedom - although relatives would barely be able to recognise them. Scroll down for video . We're free: Swiiss couple Olivier David Och and Daniela Widmer wave upon their arrival at the Qasim base in Rawalpindi today after escaping Taliban capture . Safe: The couple, who were captured while trekking in remote Pakistan, announced themselves at a checkpoint in the north of the country . Pakistan army spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said: 'They escaped, this is what they have told us. 'They reported to our checkpost then. They are being questioned at the moment in Peshawar.' According to intelligence sources in North Waziristan, where they were held, the two were found at a military checkpoint on a main road in Miranshah, the region's main town at about 5.30am local time. Handshakes: David Och and Daniela Widmer were believed to be held in North Waziristan by one of the Taliban's top lieutenants . They were then sent to the city of Peshawar by helicopter. A Swiss embassy official said the embassy was not in a position to confirm or deny the reports. Other reports, however, say the couple were freed by the Taliban in an apparent olive branch to the Pakistani government. Taliban commanders said an undisclosed ransom was paid in exchange for the release of the pair, who in October had appeared in a militant video saying their captors were threatening to kill them. Unrecognisable: The passport photos of Daniela Wider and Olivier Och . Colonel Nadeem of the Pakistani Army media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), confirmed the couple were released, moved to Peshawar and have now reached Islamabad where they are being put through a medical check up. Colonel Nadeem said: 'I can confirm that the said Swiss couple have been released, they were picked up in an area near Miranshah in South Waziristan, and have now been moved to Islamabad by security forces. 'They are in okay health.' When asked about a possible deal for their release, the Colonel said: 'I am not authorised to speak on the matter, and an official version will soon be released by the ISPR.' Olive branch? Some are claiming Olivier Och and Daniela Widmer, pictured in captivity soon after they were taken, were released as a sop to the Pakistan government . In fear of their lives: This video grab released in October shows the couple in front of Taliban gunman after they were abducted . Sources in North Waziristan say the Swiss couple were being kept by a faction of the Taliban led by Commander Wali ur Rehman, a senior disgruntled militant commander, who is tipped for the organisation's leadership after Baitullah Mehsud's death. He is considered to be closer to the Pakistan government and is keen on negotiations. Kidnapping for ransom is relatively common in Pakistan, although foreigners are not often targets. Militants also occasionally take foreigners hostage. Two Western aid workers were kidnapped by gunmen in the central Pakistani city of Multan on January 19. Another, a British doctor working with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), was kidnapped in the southwestern city of Quetta on January 5. Warren Weinstein, an American aid worker, was kidnapped from the central Pakistani city of Lahore in August last year. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for Weinstein's abduction in December.

In trouble: Sgt Gary Stein is facing dismissal from the Marines after saying he wouldn't follow orders from Obama . A military board has recommended . dismissal for the Tea Party Marine who wrote on Facebook that he would . not follow orders from President Obama. A Marine Corps administrative board . found that Sergeant Gary Stein had committed misconduct with his online . campaign against the president. After a daylong hearing at Camp . Pendleton, California, board also recommended that Stein's discharge . from the military be on an other-than-honorable basis. That would mean that the disgraced sergeant would lose his benefits and would not be allowed back on any military base. Stein's lawyers had argued that the . 9-year Marine, whose service was to end in four months, was expressing . his personal views and exercising his First Amendment rights. But the Marine Corps said it was . forced to take action after he declared on Facebook that he would not . follow orders from President Obama. That statement - which Stein later . clarified to say he would not follow unlawful orders - was part of an . online political campaign against the president under the banner of the . Armed Forces Tea Party. Stein's defence attorney, Marine Captain James Baehr, said he was 'surprised and disappointed'. 'But it was an honour to fight for a . hero like Sergeant Stein and every other Marine's right to speak . freely,' Captain Baehr added. Stein addressed board members during yesterday 's hearing, telling them he loved the Marine Corps and wanted to . re-enlist, Captain Baehr said. Captain Baehr expressed hope that the recommendation would be rejected by the general, saying the case will go forward. 'The issues are too important for this to end today,' he said. Critical: The military has had a policy since the Civil War of restricting the free speech of servicemen, including criticism of the commander in chief . During the hearing, the prosecutor, . Captain John Torresala, said Stein went as far as superimposing images . of Obama's face on a poster for the movie 'Jackass.' He argued that Stein's behavior . repeatedly violated Pentagon policy that limits the free speech rights . of service members, and said he should be dismissed after ignoring . warnings from his superiors about his postings. The government submitted screen grabs . of Stein's postings on one Facebook page he created called Armed Forces . Tea Party, which the prosecutor said included the image of Obama on the . 'Jackass' movie poster. Stein also superimposed Obama's image . on a poster for 'The Incredibles' movie that he changed to 'The . Horribles,' the prosecutor said. Captain Torresala also said anti-Obama . comments posted by Stein on a Facebook page used by Marine . meteorologists were prejudicial to good order and discipline, and could . have influenced junior Marines. Stein's security clearance was taken . away and he has no future in the Marine Corps because he can't do his . job without that clearance, Captain Torresala said. 'The Marine Corps community views the . command's lack of action as some kind of knock on good order and . discipline,' Captain Torresala said. 'Our own people are questioning why this Marine is not being held accountable.' Defensive: Sgt Stein says he did not mean to be . 'disrespectful' but he believes Obama's policies are 'crippling this . country' The military has had a policy since . the Civil War limiting the free speech of service members, including . criticism of the commander in chief. Pentagon directives say military . personnel in uniform cannot sponsor a political club; participate in any . TV or radio program or group discussion that advocates for or against a . political party, candidate or cause; or speak at any event promoting a . political movement. Commissioned officers also may not use contemptuous words against senior officials. Profile: Sgt. Stein says he is a Conservative blogger and . speaker but adds he does not 'represent the views of the United States Armed . Forces' Backed by a team of lawyers and . congressmen, Stein has said he is fighting for his constitutional rights . and should be allowed to stay in the military. His lawyers and the American Civil Liberties Union contend his views are protected by the First Amendment. 'Think about how dangerous this could . be if the U.S. government can prosecute you for something you say on . your private Facebook page,' Captain Baehr said. Response: Sgt Gary Stein posted these comments on Facebook this morning after being told he is facing possible dismissal from the Corps . Stein has said his opinions are his own and has put a disclaimer on his Facebook page saying so. His attorneys argued service members . have a right to voice their opinions as long as they do not appear to be . presenting their views as being endorsed by the military. They say the Pentagon policy is vague and military officials do not understand it. Representative Duncan Hunter, . R-Calif., a former Marine, wrote a letter to Stein's commanding officer . stating the sergeant should not face dismissal for an opinion shared by a . majority of Marines. Mr Hunter said he was referring to . Stein's statement that he would not obey unlawful orders. Representative . Darrell Issa, R-Calif., also expressed support for Stein. Stein said his statement about Obama . was part of an online debate about NATO allowing U.S. troops to be tried . for the Koran burnings in Afghanistan. In that context, he said, he was . stating that he would not follow orders from the president if it . involved detaining U.S. citizens, disarming them or doing anything else . that he believes would violate their constitutional rights.","Sergeant Gary Stein found to have committed misconduct over his comments about the president .

'We thought that more sand might come down and . kill us. The men had to dig under us to pull us out. It was really hurting us.'

Mr Chaney of Hemsby helped the two other men scoop the sand away as the woman dialled 999 to alert coastguards, firefighters and paramedics. The trio faced the possibility of being buried themselves if there was a second landslide, but they carried on digging and pulled the girls out in ten minutes. Jodie’s brother Jake, 12, ran quarter of a mile so he could get help from his parents Chris, 40, and Natasha, 39, who were at the nearby Long Beach caravan park.

And it was clearly hard to tell them apart... Ralph Evans is toasting 60 years . of marriage to wife June - after he posed as his twin brother to get a date . with her. Mr Evans, from Ashton under Lyne, Greater Manchester, fancied June when he met her back . in 1949 but there was one problem - his twin brother Ronald had just started dating her. So Ralph came up with a devious plan to . win the girl of his dreams. He told a white lie to Ronald that June had left a . message saying she couldn't make their second date - and then went himself and pretended to be his brother. Ralph Evans pretended to be his identical twin, Ronald (far left), to get a date with June in 1949. Three years later, they wed at their local church in Oswestry Shropshire (above) before honeymooning in Ashton under Lyne . The couple hit it off and three years later tied the knot. Now Ralph and June are marking their diamond wedding anniversary alongside their four . children - Carol, Wendy, Gail and Colin - 13 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Ralph said: 'I told her who I was . afterwards because she was starting to get suspicious. 'It all worked out well though because . Ronald started courting someone else and was very happily married.' Now Ralph and June are marking their diamond wedding anniversary alongside their four children, 13 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren . June, 79, said: 'I met Ralph on . Christmas Eve 1949 and he was with his identical twin. They were extremely . similar.' Ralph and June were married on March 15, . 1952 at their local church in Oswestry Shropshire before honeymooning in Ashton . under Lyne. Ralph, 82, a keen crown green bowler, said: 'My sister lived in Ashton so we used to visit frequently and really fell in . love with the area. 'June and I both come from a small town . and we like coming to Manchester - it was the big city. There was always . something to do and plenty of work up here.' The couple made a permanent move to . Tameside in 1964 and have lived in Ashton ever since. June spent much of her working life as a . laundry assistant while Ralph worked as a store-man at Piccadilly Plaza in . Manchester. The couple will celebrate their anniversary with a family meal. Ralph, whose twin brother died two years . ago, said: 'We all have our arguments - especially when you've been married for . 60 years. 'The secret is to forget about them - . don't hold any grudges and always talk to each other.' June added: 'We've always said pull . together through the worst times and the best. 'We're husband and wife but also best . friends.'","Ronald Evans had only stepped out with June once... before his brother Ralph made his cunning move .

Arnoldo Jimenez, 30, and Estrella Carrera, 26, were married on Friday, two days later police found her body in her Chicago apartment. Jimenez has not been seen since and police issued an arrest warrant on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Searching: Police are searching for Arnoldo Jimenez, 30, who has not been seen since Estrella Carrera, 26, was found dead in her bathtub on Sunday afternoon -  two days after the couple married . Carrera, a mother of two, was found around 3:30pm on Sunday in the 7800 block of South Rutherford Avenue, in the Burbank area of Chicago, according to police. Carrera's body was discovered after her sister became alarmed when she could not contact her and asked police to conduct a well-being check at the home, officials said. When police called at her third-floor home, she was found with multiple stab wounds in an empty bathtub. There were no signs of forced entry into Carrera’s apartment, according to investigators. Following their City Hall wedding ceremony, the newlyweds celebrated with friends and family renting a limo and then going on to a nightclub. Hunt: Jiminez was last known to be driving a black, four-door 2006 Maserati with Illinois license plate L641441 . The pair were last seen around 4am on Saturday morning, said officials. Jiminez was last known to be driving a black, four-door 2006 Maserati with Illinois license plate L641441. Police declared the death a homicide on Monday after autopsy results confirmed she died from stab wounds. She was due to pick up her two children - her nine-year-old daughter and two-year-old son- from a family member on Saturday afternoon but did not show up, according to the Chicago Tribune. Her cousin Sandy Lopez said Jimenez was the father of her youngest child and it was a quick wedding. They had been in an on-off relationship for three years. A spokeswoman for the Cook County Clerk's office said that Estrella did not yet have a marriage certificate on file but had applied for a marriage license on May 2. Lopez said Estrella called her on Friday to invite her to a party but didn't mention that it was a wedding party. Beautiful person: Family raised the alarm when the newlywed mother did not come to pick up her children . She told the Chicago Tribune: 'She didn't tell anybody. She didn't want to tell me she had gotten married, but she sounded happy.' She said she personally did not approve of the marriage or the relationship but was not speaking for the rest of her family. 'He's just a person who had problems,' she said. 'She was a beautiful mother, person, sister.' Distraught: Cousin Sandy Lopez broke down as she spoke about the young woman's tragic death . Relatives say Carrera was a Spanish language translator for a welfare agency. She just moved to the area about two months ago, neighbors told CW33. Neighbor Jason Tokarczyk, 24, told the Chicago Tribune she was quiet and generally kept to herself. He said he frequently saw her with her son but was surprised to hear she had married. 'I've never seen her with a dude...I figured she was a single mom,' said Mr Tokarczyk. 'She was quiet as a mouse. 'I was shocked out of my mind to hear something had happened to her.' Another neighbor said police were searching all around the area in dumpsters and garbage cans for a weapon but came up with nothing. Another local resident described the 26-year-old as 'pleasant' but said she was relatively unknown. Burbank police were releasing few details but said the death was being investigated by the South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force. Police are calling it an isolated incident stemming from a domestic situation, but did not say whether anyone was in custody as of Monday.

Burma's Nobel Peace Price laureate and pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi will travel outside her country for the first time in 24 years when she visits Britain later this year. Suu Kyi, recently elected to the year-old parliament that replaced nearly five decades of oppressive military rule, will visit Oxford where she attended university in the 1970s. She will also visit Norway during her short European tour in June, it was revealed. Invite: Burma's Nobel Peace Price laureate and pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi (right) has taken David Cameron (left) up on his offer and will visit Britain . Historic: Her trip to Britain, which will include a visit to Oxford, will be the first time she has left her country in 24 years . The 66-year-old was first detained in 1989 and spent 15 of the next 21 years in detention until her release from house arrest in November 2010. She refused to leave the country during the brief periods when she was not held by authorities, for fear of not being allowed to return. She won one of her party's 43 seats in this month's by-election following a series of reforms under President Thein Sein, a former general. They included the release of political prisoners, more media freedom, dialogue with ethnic militias and an exchange rate unification seen crucial to fixing the economy. Walkabout: The 66-year-old was first detained in 1989 and spent 15 of the next 21 years in detention until her release from house arrest in November 2010 . Considered: At the time of the invite she said the fact that she would consider the offer, rather than reject it outright, showed 'great progress' had been achieved in Myanmar . Suu Kyi was invited to visit Britain when she met Prime Minister David Cameron in Yangon on Friday. Financial transactions supporting humanitarian and not-for-profit activities will now be easier to make in Burma - after the U.S. softened a series of sanctions against the nation. Education, sports, religious and democracy-building activities in the country will benefit - as will projects meeting basic human needs. These include disaster relief, clean water and sanitation. It comes as the U.S. 'normalises relations' with Burma following recent parliamentary elections and the release of some of its political prisoners. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the elections a 'dramatic demonstration of popular will'. She said the administration was working toward sending an ambassador to Myanmar. It also wants to establish an in-country mission for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). At the time she said the fact that she would consider the offer, rather than reject it outright, showed 'great progress' had been achieved in Myanmar. She added: 'Two years ago I would have said thank you for the invitation, but sorry.' Cameron's trip capped a week-long trade mission to the Far East. He also held talks with Burmese leader Thein Sein at his sumptuous presidential palace in Naypyidaw. He told him that Britain would argue for economic sanctions on the country to be gradually lifted - but only if they continue their transition to a democracy. Suu Kyi's long refusal to leave Myanmar characterised her steely determination to defy the ruling junta. It had offered to release her from house arrest to be with her late husband, Michael Aris, who died of cancer in Britain in 1999. Their story was played out on the big screen late last year in the film The Lady, as she is affectionately known. Malaysian action Michelle Yeoh played the starring role of Suu Kyi. The daughter of assassinated independence hero Aung San visited Myanmar in April 1988 to take care of her dying mother, Khin Kyi, a former ambassador to India an Nepal. Her National League for Democracy went on to win by a landslide a 1990 election for a constitution-drafting assembly. But the military ignored the result, leading to a two-decade political stalemate between the junta and Suu Kyi's opposition.","Suu Kyi will visit Oxford where she attended university in the 1970s .

New video has emerged showing for the first time the flight attendant who caused panic on an American Airlines flight out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport yesterday. The cell phone video obtained by NBC Chicago shows a middle-aged woman with reddish-brown hair in uniform convulsing and obviously distressed, yelling at co-workers trying to subdue her to ‘get out of my way!’ Passengers were alarmed at her violent, erratic behaviour. ‘Everyone started freaking out,’ passanger Bethany Christakos said. Scroll down for videos . Frantic: The senior flight attendant (seen on the left) wrestled with other flight staff and told them: 'Get out of my way!' during a bizarre tirade . ‘She spoke in and out of Spanish,’ passenger Carolyn Kazmi told NBC Chicago. ‘She talked about the flight crashing, that we were going to go back to the gate.’ Other passengers said that the woman made frequent comments about her medication, and expressed their relief that they weren’t in the air. Customer Brad LeClear made the call to 911 and then helped assist the flight crew in trying to subdue the woman. ‘She claimed when we were holding her, I tried to talk her down and calm her down a little bit,’ he told the station. ‘She said she was bipolar.’ Flight 2332 was halted after the woman commandeered the plane’s public address system and told passengers there were technical difficulties. First class travelers helped the cabin crew subdue the attendant, after she started screaming random things like she was ‘not responsible for crashing this plane' and that they couldn't take off because there wasn't enough ice on board, according to witnesses.

'She was just screaming — blood-curdling screams,' said Ms Christakos. 'I will never get that sound of her screaming out of my head.' Passenger Greg Lozano said: 'We were pretty frightened. I was glad we weren't in the air.' The plane was turned around and taxied back to the gate, where state trooper escorted two stewardesses off the aircraft. One of the women was seen fighting police and ‘kicking and screaming’ as she was put in a patrol car. Both women were later treated in a nearby hospital.

Suicide bombers struck the U.S. embassy and Nato headquarters in the city yesterday in a series of co-ordinated attacks. It finally ended this morning in a flurry of gunfire as six of the terrorists were killed. At least seven innocent people, including four policemen, were killed in the assault. The attacks proved yet again that despite massive security, the Taliban can strike at will against key targets in the capital. Gun-battle: A NATO chopper hovers over the building where Taliban militants took positions to launch attacks in Kabul . Assault: The helicopter circles the building where Taliban fighters are holed up . Ready for action: Afghan soldiers take position at the scene after the Taliban attack . Rockets and bullets were fired into the American compound, while suicide bombers struck against police and intelligence targets. The insurgents holed up in an unfinished high-rise building overlooking the diplomatic quarter, armed with rockets. Afghan security forces fought them floor-by-floor during what was the longest sustained attack on the capital since the U.S.-led invasion a decade ago. A few fighters held out overnight, with residents taking cover indoors with their lights off and helicopters flying low overhead. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the attack on the embassy as 'cowardly'. Coming two days after the tenth anniversary of the September 11 atrocities, the well-planned assaults carried an unsettling message to Western leaders and their Afghan allies about the resilience and reach of the Taliban network. Afghan officials have claimed their capital was protected by a ‘ring of steel’ but there is now concern about their inability to secure the city without Western help. Last month suicide bombers and gunmen stormed the British Council offices in the city, leaving 12 dead after a seven-hour siege.

Taliban fighters took over a multi-storey building near the diplomatic district and started firing rockets . A Kabul police official blamed Pakistan-based Taliban militia for the latest attack and said one rocket hit a school bus, but fortunately it was empty. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the fighters were armed with rocket-propelled grenades, suicide bomb vests and AK-47 rifles. Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the assaults were aimed at thwarting plans to hand over security to Afghan forces but they would not succeed. ‘We are following the events closely; we have confidence in the Afghan authorities’ ability to deal with this situation,’ he said. ‘Transition is on track and it will continue.’ It was the third major attack in Kabul since late June, casting fresh doubts on the ability of Afghans to secure their own country as the U.S. and other foreign troops prepare to withdraw by the end of 2014. The American Embassy and NATO both said no staff were wounded. Smoke rises from buildings during the coordinated attack across the Afghan capital . An Afghan policeman keeping watch. Insurgents fired rockets and sent out two suicide bombers . Afghan officials said at least one Afghan police officer, a civilian, and two insurgents had been killed as gunfire and explosions resounded across the city well into the afternoon.

In western Kabul, a few miles away, a suicide bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to a building belonging to the city's civil order police, killing a policeman and wounding two. A second suicide bomber killed a civilian at the regional police centre, near the Habibia high school, and wounded four, while at a road near the airport, a suicide bomber was killed by police and 15.5 lb of explosives seized.

"By . Rob Cooper . PUBLISHED: . 05:22 EST, 20 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:43 EST, 20 March 2012 . Inflation joy: George Osborne, pictured today in Downing Street, was boosted by the news that inflation has fallen to a 15-month low on the eve of his budget . George Osborne was given a pre-Budget boost today as inflation fell to a 15-month low of 3.4 per cent. Lower utility bills and discounts from struggling retailers have contributed to the fall in the consumer prices index (CPI). Inflation dipped to 3.4 per cent last month down from 3.6 per cent in January, . the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said as energy companies E.ON and Scottish . Power cut their prices. The last time the CPI was lower was in November 2010 when it stood at 3.3 per cent. The retail prices index, which . includes the cost of mortgages, also fell to 3.7 per cent in February, . down from 3.9 per cent in January. The figures were published today ahead . of George Osborne's budget tomorrow when he is expected to ease the . burden on family finances by raising the tax threshold to around £9,000. He is also expected to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p. Despite . today's positive inflation news for the Chancellor, there are fears . that soaring oil prices may prevent it from falling later this year as . sharply as had been predicted. Lower price rises will be welcomed by households that were squeezed by high prices and sluggish wage growth throughout 2011. The . decision will also add further weight to the Bank of England's decision . to pump an extra £50billion into its quantitative easing programme last . month. Bank governor . Sir Mervyn King and his colleagues have forecast the rate of inflation . to dip below the Government's 2 per cent target at some point early next . year. The greatest . downward pressure on the CPI rate came from domestic electricity and gas . bills, which fell 1.3 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively. Scottish . Power reduced gas tariffs by an average 5 per cent for around 1.4 . million domestic gas customers last month, after E.ON announced a 6 per . cent fall in electricity bills, benefiting 3.7 million customers. Falling: The Consumer Prices Index, the Government's preferred measure of inflation, fell to 3.4% last month, figures revealed today. It is the first time it has been so low since November 2010 Last October, prices were increasing at above 5% . Change: The rising cost of alcohol and tobacco added 0.08% to the cost of a typical basket of goods last month. However, inflation was kept down by a large fall in the price of utilities . But . there was also a drop in the cost of recreation and culture, driven by . cheaper digital cameras, pet-related products and books, newspapers and . stationery. Air fares fell by 1.6 per cent, compared to a 2.1 per cent rise a year ago, driven by cheaper European tickets, the ONS said. The . average price of petrol rose in February by 1.9p a litre to 135.1p, . while diesel rose 1.4p to hit a record high of 143p a litre. But the ONS . said this had a negligible effect on the overall rate of inflation. The price of crude oil has risen by 25 per cent to $125 per barrel since the start of the year as tensions in Iran and Syria escalate. Barack Obama and David Cameron discussed releasing more oil reserves onto the market to stop further price rises. Elsewhere, alcohol prices rose 2.6 per cent which is a record rise for a January-to-February period. Budget discussions: The quad - (from left to right) Danny Alexander, David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg - discuss the 2012 Budget in 10 Downing Street yesterday . Boost: George Osborne, pictured during a visit to Barclays Bank yesterday, was delivered a pre-budget boost as inflation fell to 3.4 per cent . Vicky . Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said food prices, . which were steady in February, could rise in months ahead in response to . the recently-declared droughts. She . said: 'The downward trend in the headline rate is likely to pause over . the next couple of months. Indeed, inflation could even rise in March on . the back of the continued rise in petrol prices.' Matthew Cheung, chief economist at the market analysts RANsquawk, said: 'The fall was less than expected, but from the Bank of England's perspective, so far so good. 'But there's every indication the CPI rate will float down, rather than tumble. 'Behind . the falling year-on-year number are some conflicting drivers. While the . prices of many consumer goods have been cut, the oil price crept up . throughout February. 'Currently at $125 a barrel, oil now poses the primary inflationary risk. 'With . the impact of last year's VAT rise fast disappearing from the . year-on-year figure, next month's figure will flatter the Bank much . less.' Falling inflation has provided a small boost to beleaguered savers who have seen their nest eggs cannibalised over recent years. With . the Bank of England base rate held at a historic low of 0.5 per cent . for three years in a row, savers struggled to open accounts that keep up . with the rate of inflation. Today a basic rate taxpayer needs an account that pays 4.25 per cent interest just to keep up with the rate of inflation. A higher rate 40 per cent taxpayer must achieve a rate of 5.66 per cent. In order to achieve that, savers will need to use tax-free ISAs or lock up their money over the long term. A survey today revealed 87 per cent of people are concerned about the effect of inflation on their income. A . third of people (33 per cent) believe inflation will rise over the next . three years, according to Post Office Savings. Just 15 per cent believe . it will go down. Over half of people - 53 per cent - do not know what the current rate of inflation is. Richard . Norman, director of savings and investments at Post Office, said: . 'Today’s inflation announcement will serve as a welcome relief for UK . savers.' 'With RPI at 3.7 . per cent today, is still higher than the 10 year average of 3.1 per cent . and five year average of 3.5 per cent.' Improvement: £10.7bn was lent in February - up 14 per cent on the same period last year . Mortgage lending is up 14 per cent in the last year as first-time buyers rush to purchase properties before the stamp duty amnesty ends this weekend. Banks provided £10.7billion in February and mortgage lending has now been higher year-on-year for the last seven months in a row, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said today. From Saturday, the two-year stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers purchasing homes worth between £125,000 and £250,000 comes to an end. The looming deadline has prompted a . recent surge of interest from this sector of the market, according to . lenders and estate agents, who have called for the holiday to be . extended. The latest lending figure is 'almost identical' to the January, when £10.65 billion was lent. CML chief economist Bob Pannell said: 'Although a seasonal decline is expected over the winter months, our forward estimates suggest that February was the seventh month in a row of higher year-on-year lending. 'This indicates that lending for house purchase remains brisk in advance of the ending of the stamp duty concession.' Mr Pannell said the pick-up in activity also appears to mark 'a more generalised improvement' across the market, perhaps reflecting hopes that the squeeze on household incomes caused by high bills and tough employment conditions is easing off. He said: 'This may reflect household sentiment stabilising in anticipation of a recovery in real incomes, but wider economic uncertainties make it difficult to judge how well the upturn will persist.' He said a scheme recently launched by the Government to help buyers purchase a new-build property had the potential to offset the expected dip caused by the ending of the stamp duty concession. The NewBuy scheme enables first-time buyers and home-movers to purchase a new-build home with a deposit of only 5 per cent or 10 per cent, rather than the 20 per cent often demanded by lenders, although this will do little to help those trying to buy or sell an existing property. Mr Pannell said: 'The launch of the NewBuy scheme is an important addition to lenders' toolkit in addressing the various needs of would-be borrowers. 'The scheme has the potential to offset the dip in first-time buyer activity that the end of the stamp duty concession on March 24 may produce.'","Fall was less than expected and there are fears over rising oil prices .

"By . Paul Revoir . PUBLISHED: . 20:29 EST, 8 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:29 EST, 8 March 2012 . The BBC has already spent £6.5million on relocation deals for just 549 staff moving to its new headquarters in Salford. Dozens of workers have been given tens of thousands of pounds each to fund their move. Figures released under the Freedom of Information act show that already three members of staff have received in excess of £80,000 to pay for their moves, with two getting about £85,000. The BBC's new Salford base has been operational since May 2011, and began broadcasting from the site in September . Another has received £70,000, with two others getting £67,000 and another £64,000 as the true individual cost of the move is laid bare. The BBC’s offer to workers moving to Salford includes payments for stamp duty, estate agents fees, not to mention up to £3,000 a head to buy carpets and curtains. Others have received up to £1,900 a month, before tax, to rent a home in the North West, in a deal which lasts for up to two years, allowing them to temporarily maintain current homes. The corporation has even provided a house-buying scheme which sees it, through an external company, buying staff’s properties for 85 per cent of their market value. The new figures, which cover the period up to mid-November, also show more than a dozen people have been given between £40,000 and £50,000 with almost 30 receiving between £30,000 and £40,000 and about 35 individuals in the £20,000 to £30,000 band. The figures are set to rise further as they do not even cover the remaining 250 individuals in the first phase of the move. BBC Presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins have decided to leave the breakfast news show rather than go with their jobs to the new MediaCityUK complex in Salford. A further thousand roles are being relocated to Salford in a second phase, although it is currently unclear how many people will decide to move with their jobs. The BBC has already moved its children’s department, sport, Radio 5 Live as well as part of its new media division to Salford and hopes to move BBC Breakfast there next month. Presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins have decided to leave the breakfast news show rather than go with their jobs to the new MediaCityUK complex in Salford. Broadcasting bosses had originally earmarked £30million for relocation deals and believe that they will fall well within budget for this. Nevertheless some of the large individual payments will raise questions about the controversial move and whether the attempts to make the BBC less London-centric’ are too costly. There is also a provision for temporary accommodation costs to be paid for up to six months and duplicate costs for gas, water and electricity and council tax can also covered for those caught in a housing chain. The BBC’s scheme will pay for estate agent fees of up to 1.5 per cent of the sale price, and the £3,000 towards ‘household goods’ like carpets and curtains for those moving house. The so-called Remote Location Allowance, allows people to receive up to £1,900 a month for two years, if they are not in a position to fully move from their London home, such as in cases where children are taking exams. Figures provided under the Freedom of Information request, cover up to mid-November, and account for almost 550 out of about 800 people that opted to make the move as part of the first phase. About 1,500 roles have moved from London in the initial ‘migration’, . Other costs incurred by the BBC include interest payments on bank loans for the house-buying scheme and paying tax liabilities on relocation payments. Most up to date figures show 160 people are on remote location deals and only 30 people have taken part in the BBC’s house-buying scheme, with vast majority buying houses in the traditional way. The Salford base has been operational since May 2011 and began broadcasting from the site in September. The BBC says that by next month the first phase of the move will be complete. BBC North human resources director Ken Lee said the new figures represent a ‘snapshot’ at a point in time and said the corporation’s packages had been benchmarked against other organisations. He said the deals were not about ‘enrichment’ but making sure people did not lose any money as a result of relocating their jobs.",BBC bosses believe they will fall within £30m budget for relocation deals .

British taxpayers are underwriting a multi-million-pound loan to help China plant trees as part of a project to tackle climate change. The Treasury has agreed to a European Union scheme to help the country grow forests to compensate for its contribution to global warming. The Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank – of which the Chancellor is a governor – has lent China  £210million (250million euros) to kickstart the project. Reforestation: The Treasury has agreed to help China grow forests. Pictured, trees in the China's Xinjiang Uygur region . Britain has agreed to underwrite the loan, covering 16p in every pound that is not paid back should the debt turn toxic – which would cost us more than £30million. While EU member states – which are the EIB’s shareholders – are mired in trillions of pounds of debt and sluggish growth, China is now the second largest economy in the world and continues to expand by 2 per cent a year. India and Brazil are among other countries with surging economies to receive similar EU anti-climate change loans in the past 12 months. Changing landscape: A new Ferrari roars through Beijing against the backdrop of a traditional temple. China is now the World's second biggest economy . Since last year, the deals have seen the UK taxpayer loaded with an extra £920million of liabilities. The British government has announced plans to stop sending aid to China. But, through the EIB, we will still be underwriting loans to the country for years to come. Last night, critics expressed amazement that the UK was helping China plant trees – saying the move could harm our economy. Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘As a result of ridiculous climate change policies at home, we are seeing industries relocating to China because energy here is becoming so expensive. Helping hand: The UK underwrote nearly £1billion for climate change packages in the last year alone, sending hundreds of millions off to countries like Brazil, pictured . ‘And yet at the same time as we are exporting industry, it turns out we are helping them curb their own climate change emissions. ‘You couldn’t make this up – it’s like a late April Fools.’ He added: ‘This is what happens when you’re controlled by a supranational body like the European Union. We want to make our own decisions.’ Roger Helmer MEP, industry spokesman for UKIP, said: ‘The revelations that the UK is underwriting nearly £1billion for climate change packages in the last year alone is staggering. That we are sending hundreds of millions off to Brazil, India and China to plant trees and the like is quite simply absurd.’ The Chinese deal was struck last month between Beijing and the EIB, which borrows money from the markets to lend out. A total of £210million (250million . euros) will support eight forestry projects, which will involve the . planting of millions of trees to soak up industrial carbon emissions. The . loan comes in the wake of two others to China totalling £460million . (550million euros) for ‘green’ energy schemes in 2007 and 2010. China’s carbon dioxide emissions rose 10 per cent in 2010 to 8.33billion tons – a quarter of the global total. Loadsa money: The UK has contributed money to EU projects including one to pay for a Belgian dance teacher to run a project in Burkina Faso . Meanwhile Britain is backing more investment to India through the EIB. Last summer, it lent £167million (200million euros) to Mumbai-based financial giant ICICI Bank to distribute to renewable energy projects and has since approved another £82million (100million euros). This comes despite India recently telling the UK that it doesn’t need the £1.1billion of foreign aid London is sending there over the next four years, describing it as ‘a peanut’. And, in October, the government of Brazil – where annual growth is 5 per cent – was given a £418million (500million euros) loan to support undefined ‘green’ schemes. In all, since the start of 2011, the EIB has paid out 66 loans worth a total of £5.4billion (6.4billion euros) in a bid to fight climate change. The EIB insisted that the risk to the British taxpayer was a remote one. A spokesman said: ‘We perform due diligence to ensure that all projects are economically and financially viable, technically adequate and in compliance with the Bank’s environmental and social requirements. But Tory MEP Daniel Hannan said: ‘The true purpose of EIB loans is to buy the loyalty of the contractors, consultants and middle-men that feed off the system.’","UK agrees to underwrite loan which could cost us £30million .

Mr Mueen-Uddin moved to Britain from Bangladesh in the early 1970s and has since become a British citizen and forged a successful career as a community activist and Muslim leader. In 1989 he was a key figure in the protests against Salman Rushdie controversial book, The Satanic Verses. And he was photographed with Prince Charles when the heir visited a Islamic centre in Leicester in 2003. In the early 1970s, before he moved to Britain, Mr Mueen-Uddin was a member of Jamaat-e-Islami, a fundamentalist party that supported Pakistan during Bangladesh’s fight for independence. More...

In between their champagne-swilling lunch and glitzy dinner reception, Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha took time to visit a centre in Washington DC that helps with a cause close to their hearts. They visited the National Children’s Center yesterday, which provides services for children and adults with developmental disabilities. The centre was chosen for the Camerons' visit because of their interest in special needs support due to their experience of caring for son Ivan, who died aged six in 2009 after being born with a rare condition which gave him epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Compassion: Samantha and David Cameron talk to LaJoy Law (back facing camera) as Mr Cameron holds her seven-month-old daughter Abria during a visit to the National Children's Center . The Camerons were clearly moved as they spoke with therapists and nursing staff about the help they offer to more than 500 children and young adults with a variety of disabilities. Showing compassion - and creating a perfect photo opportunity - Mr Cameron cradled seven-month-old Abria Law, who was born three months prematurely, weighing just one pound six ounces. The couple spoke to mother LaJoy Law, while Abria curled her tiny hand around Samantha’s finger.

Mrs Cameron, wearing a maroon dress from Victoria Beckham’s range, held the hand of two-year-old Azahr Jackson, who has cerebral palsy, and stroked his arm as he practiced sitting upright. She and Mr Cameron applauded warmly as he managed to sit up without assistance. The couple had just come from a glittering lunch hosted by Vice-President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the State Department. They were joined by famous faces including Vogue Editor Anna Wintour and ex-Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the visit to the Children’s Center, Mr and Mrs Cameron headed back to the White House for a state dinner, attended by dignitaries and celebrities including George Clooney, Olympian Denise Lewis and Warren Buffett. Mr Cameron is finishing his trip to the States today with a stop in the New York City area. The Prime Minister is expected to meet Newark Mayor Cory Booker, before making a visit to the World Trade Center site and September 11 memorial. He’ll then meet with students at New York University before heading back to Britain this evening.

He boasted to undercover reporters about a Chequers event, saying: ‘I was sitting next to Sam and I said to her, “Do you want a Ruby Murray?”, and she said, “Yeah, go on then.” Party time: Samantha Cameron is planning to have a big bash to celebrate her 41st birthday .

Centre of breach: Spies created a fake Facebook account for Nato's Supreme Allied Commander, Admiral James Stavridis (above) in a bid to steal private information from his friends . Nato's most senior commander has been embroiled in a major security alert after a fake Facebook account was set up in his name by ‘Chinese spies’. Senior British military officers and Ministry of Defence staff are understood to have accepted ‘friend requests’ from a bogus account for Nato’s Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis. In the mistaken belief they had linked up with the American admiral on the site, they then unwittingly provided a treasure trove of personal details – including pictures, phone numbers and email addresses. Nato will not officially say who was behind the cyber-fraud or who accepted friend requests but it is understood that evidence points to Chinese state-sponsored hackers. Admiral Stavridis – who was in charge of operations in Libya to bring about the end of Colonel Gaddafi’s regime – now has an official Facebook page, while the bogus one has been permanently deleted from the internet. Although spies are unlikely to have found any genuine military secrets, it is not known how much information was harvested and any personal details could be used to create profiles of targets for blackmail or espionage. Officials at SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, confirmed the admiral had been targeted. A spokesman said: ‘This type of compromising attempt is called “social engineering” and has nothing to do with hacking or espionage. ‘Discussions/chats/postings on Facebook are of course only about unclassified topics.’ A Nato official added: ‘There have been several fake Supreme Allied Commander pages. We are not aware that they are Chinese. Facebook has co-operated in taking them down.’ Internet con: The genuine Facebook page of Adml Stavridis, which was imitated by suspected Chinese spies . Nato officials asked the networking site to remove the fake page last year. Facebook said false accounts have very different footprints from normal users and are identified using the most sophisticated techniques. An MoD spokesman said:  ‘We issue guidance on the risks and benefits of channels such  as Facebook.’ The fake Facebook account is the latest tactic in the use of the internet to spy on key figures, with an increasing fear that Chinese intelligence agencies are using ‘electronic warfare’ to target not just military secrets but every aspect of western life. Information allegedly stolen by hackers includes secrets of stealth aircraft, submarine technology, the space programme and solar energy. A Facebook spokesman said: 'We removed the profile for violating our terms within a business day of receiving a report.' Threat: Officials at Nato's headquarters in Brussels (above) got Facebook to remove the bogus account as soon as they were made aware of it late last year .","British top brass and MoD officials duped into accepting 'friend requests'

Ejected: Rachael Pagani, 20, pictured here in a Facebook image, was being thrown out of the Walkabout bar in Carlisle when she threw a champagne bottle across the dancefloor . A former international ice skater who knocked a woman unconscious with a champagne bottle 'for no reason' has been jailed. Rachael Pagani, who had 'tremendous potential' as a young ice skating champion, hurled a bottle across a crowded nightclub dancefloor after being thrown out the Walkabout bar in Carlisle. The 20-year-old became involved in a scuffle with other revellers in the club and was escorted from the bar after the row in December. But as she collected her bag, Ms . Pagani grabbed a champagne bottle and threw it across the packed . dancefloor, striking Hayley Dodgson, 20, on the back of the head. Miss Dodgson was rushed to hospital and treated for a 3cm gash to the head after the incident.

Neolithic people 'packed' the base of the Garsdom Edge monolith with smaller stones and angled it precisely using the altitude of the sun . A seven-foot monolith in the Peak District was erected to track the sun 4,000 years ago, researchers believe - and could have been an important pagan site. Neolithic people 'packed' the base of the Garsdom Edge monolith with smaller stones and angled it precisely using the altitude of the sun. The researchers believe the stone was put there for symbolic reasons, and angled precisely to catch light through the changing seasons. At midsummer, the stone would 'light up' - but in winter, it would be permanently shadowed. A similar cycle is used at other burial sites to symbolise eternity, the researchers say. The people who raised the stone would have just switched from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to primitive farming. Researchers carried out a detailed 'microtopography' survey of the ground around the monolith, and believe that stones were carefully packed aroun the stone. A 3D model of how light strikes the monolith - adjusted for changes in Earth's tilt over four millennia - shows that the stone was very precisely angled to catch the sun. The orientation and inclination of the slope is aligned to the altitude of the Sun at mid-summer. The Nottingham Trent University researchers believe that the monolith was set in place to give symbolic meaning to the location through the changing seasons. The landscape surrounding the stone harbors many ancient monuments such as Bronze Age roundhouses, a late Neolithic enclosure, and other traces of a long lasting human occupation. ‘Given the sensitivity of the site, we can’t probe under the surface of the soil. However, through our survey, we have found a higher density of packing stones on one side, supporting the case that the stone has been orientated intentionally,’ said Dr. Brown. A 3D model of the stone - adjusted for the change in Earth's tilt over four millennia - showed how it would have caught the light on Midsummer's day and remained in darkness through winter . The researchers showed how the stone was carefully angled to catch the sun at certain seasons . The 3-D modeling shows that during the winter half-year, the slanted side of the stone would remain in permanent shadow; during most of the summer half-year it would only be illuminated during the morning and afternoon; close to midsummer it would be illuminated all day. The researchers are currently backing up the modeling work by gathering contemporary photographic evidence of the stone. ‘The stone would have been an ideal marker for a social arena for seasonal gatherings,’ said Dr. Brown. ‘It’s not a sundial in the sense that people would have used it to determine an exact time. We think that it was set in position to give a symbolic meaning to its location, a bit like the way that some religious buildings are aligned in a specific direction for symbolic reasons.’ The researchers hope that the new evidence will support the case for a wider archaeological survey of the site. ‘The use of shadow casting in monuments of this period is quite rare in the British Isles,’ said Dr. Brown. ‘But there are some examples including New Grange, Ireland, and some Clava cairns in the north-east of Scotland that have been proposed to include the intentional use of shadows. 'Both are associated to burial sites using the symbolism of a cyclic light and shadow display to represent eternity. Given the proximity of the Neolithic enclosure and possible ritual importance of this site, the Gardom’s Edge monolith could be another such example.’","Stone was angled using 'packing stones' at base .

He acted with selfless disregard for his own life when confronted with the terror of a colleague grievously-injured in an explosion on the Afghan battlefield. Private Martin Bell, a young paratrooper with a reputation for remarkable courage, disobeyed a direct order from his commander not to help his stricken friend because his own life would be at risk. Displaying unimaginable bravery the 24-year-old dashed across land strewn with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to reach comrade Private Scott Meenagh, who had lost both legs in the blast. He administered immediate first aid, . saving his friend’s life. But as he helped pull the injured soldier’s . stretcher up a steep bank, he tragically triggered a homemade bomb and . was killed.

He touched so many hearts in his 24 years, if I live to be 424 I’ll never do the same - he was just an amazing son. ‘He was told to stay where he was but could not see Scott. ‘He ran across what was classed as dangerous ground to apply a tourniquet to both his legs and inject morphine.

Downsizing: When Mark Thompson took on the role in 2004 he had a basic salary of £609,000 and a further £10,000 in pension top-ups and bonuses . The new BBC director general will not be eligible for a bonus or pension top-ups and will have a salary under £500,000. In a sign that the corporation has heeded public anger at inflated salaries, the corporation has dramatically scaled back the perks of the job. When Mark Thompson took on the role in 2004 he had a basic salary of £609,000 and a further £10,000 in pension top-ups and bonuses. By 2010 his total remuneration package was at a high of £838,000 before he agreed to curb is pay as part of rigorous cost-cutting measures. Thompson, 54, now earns £671,000 a year but one senior insider said it would be “a surprise” if the new director general is paid more than £450,000. The BBC has now begun its search for a replacement, unveiling an advert for the role on its website calling for an 'inspirational' leader to take the helm. Despite the job being both chief executive and editor-in-chief of one of the biggest news providers, broadcasters and producers in the world, it is not a 'must have' for applicants to have journalistic or programme-making experience. The advert said: ‘Experience as a journalist and/or programme maker would be desirable but is not essential,’ the ad states. ‘Understanding of new platforms and technologies (for example, online and mobile) is essential. Experience of harnessing these to transform business performance would be valuable.’ Odds on: The BBC's chief operating officer Caroline Thomson is favourite for the role according to bookmakers William Hill who have made her 5/2 on to get the job . It also stipulated the new boss needed to 'be able to admit quickly when in the wrong... but stand up to huge pressure without bending when s/he believes that it is right so to do.' Mr Thompson announced he was stepping down last month and said he would go 'once the Olympics and the rest of the amazing summer of 2012 are over.' He said he wanted his successor to “have time to really get their feet under the table” before the next review of the BBC charter which will take place before the end of 2016. The advert states: 'The Trust is looking for an inspirational leader with the strong, clear vision that will take the BBC through the next review of the Corporation’s Charter, ready for the world as it will be in 10 or 15 years time.' The BBC’s chief operating officer Caroline Thomson is favourite for the role according to bookmakers William Hill who have made her 5/2 on to get the job. Finish line: Mr Thompson announced he was stepping down last month and said he would go 'once the Olympics and the rest of the amazing summer of 2012 are over' Other contenders include George Entwistle - director of BBC Vision - who is 11/4 and current ITV boss Peter Fincham who is 12/1. BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has made clear that whoever takes over - they will not be paid as much as Mark Thompson. He said in a recent interview: ‘The biggest issue for the public is senior executive pay, because what’s happened does seem to fly in the face of public service ethos. ‘And I think we can deal with all that; and if we do so, we’ll deal with one of the most toxic reasons for the public’s lack of sympathy for the BBC as an institution, even though they like enormously what it does.’ One suggestion he made was capping senior salaries but he has made clear that he feels there should be a limit to the number of BBC executives who are paid more than the Prime Minister’s £142,500 a year. The advert states that 'remuneration will reflect the unique challenge and privilege of leading the BBC, as well as the fact that it is financed by licence fee payers.' Big move: Mr Thompson also oversaw the move to Salford which has seen around 2,500 staff move north and some high-profile faces, including BBC Breakfast presenter Sian Williams, refuse to go . It adds that there will be a “annual base salary” but no “variable component” which refers to bonuses and pension top ups. Applicants have until May 7 to throw their name into the hat and it is hoped that a successor will be found by the summer. Mr Thompson’s time in the top job saw the BBC hit by scandals including Sachsgate which saw a public outcry over obscene messages left by Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand on Andrew Sachs’ answerphone which were then broadcast on Brand’s Radio 2 show. In 2007, there was also Crowngate which saw Mr Fincham, then BBC1 controller, resign after misleading footage appearing to show the Queen storming out of a photoshoot was used in a trailer. Issues of excessive pay, salaries for top talent and the treatment of older women presenters also caused problems. Mr Thompson also oversaw the move to Salford which has seen around 2,500 staff move north and some high-profile faces, including BBC Breakfast presenter Sian Williams, refuse to go. Successes include the launch of the iPlayer which has been a huge hit and allows viewers to catch up on shows via internet-connected TVs, computers and mobile phones. Mr Thompson also oversaw the Delivering Quality First process which saw the BBC commit to saving billions of pounds from its budget after the annual licence fee was frozen at £145.50 for six years.","Corporation has heeded public anger at high salaries, and has dramatically scaled back the perks of the job .

One of the two men involved in a Good Friday shooting spree which left three dead and two injured has denied he was motivated by racism. Jake England has been accused of a hate crime for his role in the Tulsa killings alongside his roommate Alvin Watts, which came just a day after he posted a racially charged message on Facebook. However, in an interview from his cell he has insisted he is not racist, and even said that some of his 'best friends' are African-American. The 19-year-old also spoke of the torment of witnessing the death of his father, who was killed during an attempted burglary, and his girlfriend, who shot herself at their home. Scroll down for video . Interview: Shooting suspect Jake England told his lawyer he was not motivated by racism . Accused: Alvin Watts, right, and England have confessed to a murderous shooting spree on Good Friday . England and Watts, 32, have confessed to shooting five black men on the evening of April 6, killing three and sending two more to hospital. They drove around the city in a white pick-up truck, attacking their victims after asking them for directions. On Sunday, police followed the pair from the house they shared and arrested them, providing relief for African-American residents of Tulsa who had been terrified by the prospect of a killer on the loose. In an interview with his lawyer, Clark Brewster, England said that he was not a racist, and added that growing up on the city's majority-black north side had enabled him to make friends with people of all races. Grief: Relatives mourn at the funeral of shooting victim Bobby Clark in Tulsa on Friday . Roommates: The pair were arrested on Sunday after being followed from their home by police . Tirade: The day before the Good Friday shootings, Jake England railed against the 'f****** n*****' who shot and killed his father Carl England . When asked if he harboured any 'ill will' towards African-Americans, he replied: 'Always have gotten along. Didn't matter what colour they were,' according to footage of the interview posted on KOTV. He added: 'The line of work that I was in and the place I worked, we always got along with everybody.' And when asked by Mr Brewster whether it was correct that he had 'African-Americans that you count among your best friends', England - who has Cherokee heritage - said that it was. The day before the Good Friday shootings, England posted a message on Facebook saying: 'Today is two years that my dad has been gone shot by a f****** n*****'. But he told his lawyer: 'It was to express the way I was upset over the guy that shot my dad. But that's the only time I've ever expressed anything like that about somebody.' Home: Tulsa massacre suspects England and Watts lived together in this one-story house . Gunned down: Carl England was killed by an ex-convict after a fight at his daughter's apartment complex . England also used the interview to describe his troubled upbringing by a mother who has been in prison for over a decade and a father killed in 2010. Soon after his father's death, the teenager became responsible for bringing up his sister Katie, now 16, who was 'a little much for [other relatives] to handle'. He was in a two-year relationship with girlfriend Sheran, and the couple had a baby son, Jacob Jr, born in October last year. But in January, she shot herself in front of him and one of her other children. England told Mr Brewer that he had been disturbed by the violent incident, and said: 'I got medication to help me overcome bad thoughts, I guess.' He wrote on Facebook that 'it's hard not to go off', and said that he was 'gone in the head'. The three men who died in England and Watts's rampage have been named as Dannaer Fields, 49, Bobby Clark, 54, and William Allen, 31. The two men wounded in the attacks, David Hall, 46, and Deon Tucker, 44, have since been released from hospital.

Jailed: Peter Chen was driving at up to twice the speed limit when he hit Ray Tutton in the early hours of Christmas Eve last year . A gambling addict who mowed down and killed a father-of-three while racing to a casino has been jailed for more than three years. Peter Chen’s car struck pedestrian Ray Tutton with such force that he was tossed through the air like a ‘bin bag’ and landed more than 30metres away. Chen, 40, had been doing up to 60mph in a 30mph zone and was rushing back to a casino, having had to return home to get more money during a night of gambling. Mr Tutton, 46, and his wife Liz, 47, were walking home from a night out at a pub in Poole, Dorset, when the collision happened in the early hours of Christmas Eve last year. Mrs Tutton later told police how her husband was slightly in front of her on a pedestrian crossing before he was flung through the air in a split second. She said at first she thought the object in the air was a bin bag before she realised what had happened. Mr Tutton’s lifeless body came to rest 33metres further down the road, Bournemouth Crown Court heard. A passing paramedic stopped to help the elevator engineer but he died shortly afterwards in hospital. Two men drove past Chen’s Nissan Micra . car and turned around to follow it when they saw both the damage to its . front and the accident scene. Mike Coombes and Jamie Lindsay, both nightclub bouncers, eventually caught up with Chen and blocked his car in before police arrived and arrested him. Victim: Ray Tutton and his wife Liz (left) were walking home from a night out at a pub in Poole, Dorset, when the collision happened . Chen, a chef, told officers he had been to a casino, spent his money and gone back home to get more funds. Marton Booth, prosecuting, said: 'He was in a rush to get back to the casino to gamble further; he told police he was anxious to get there. 'When asked what speed he had been travelling at when he collided with Mr Tutton, Chen replied that he was driving at between 50 and 60mph in a 30mph zone. 'Mr Tutton was slightly in front of his wife and she has described seeing headlights in the distance. 'In a split second her husband was no longer there. 'She saw what she thought was a bin liner in the air and then she realised it was the body of her husband, about 33metres away from the crossing.' Tribute: Flowers left at the crash scene in Poole . Chen, a Malaysian national, pleaded guilty to a charge of causing death by dangerous driving. Jailing Chen for three years and four months, Judge Samuel Wiggs told him: 'You were in such a hurry to get back to the casino that, on a road you must have been familiar with, you completely failed to see the light was red. 'You took the life of a hard-working family man and it doesn’t need me to go through the anguish that will have caused those close to him. 'They had no idea that the happy evening was going to turn out so tragically - you were responsible for that.' After the case Mrs Tutton said no length of prison sentence would have been enough for her. She said: 'It doesn’t seem like a long time but even if the maximum sentence of 14 years had been imposed it wouldn’t have been enough. Nothing will bring Ray back. 'In some ways it would have been more understandable if it had been a teenager who had been drinking; not a 40-year-old man who was stone-cold sober and all because of his gambling habit.'","Ray Tutton, 46, was walking through Poole, Dorset, in the early hours of the morning when he was run over ."

A policeman at the centre of the Scotland Yard racism crisis is to be prosecuted for allegedly abusing a suspect. PC Alex MacFarlane, 52, was apparently recorded telling a 21-year-old black man he ‘will always be a n*****’ during last summer’s riots. The decision to act is a  U-turn for the Crown Prosecution Service who originally expressed doubts about the case. Scroll down for video . Charges: PC Alex MacFarlane (pictured) is to be charged with racially abusing a suspect during the summer riots . But after being threatened with a . High Court challenge, the CPS now says MacFarlane can be charged with a . racially aggravated public order offence. MacFarlane, a response officer based . in Newham, East London, has been suspended from duty since Mauro . Demetrio claimed he was abused in the back of a police van on August 10. His recording forced senior officers to confront a backlog of outstanding racism claims. There are now 11 allegations involving . 18 officers and a civilian worker under investigation by Scotland Yard . and the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Chaos: A Pc allegedly hurled racist abuse at a 21-year-old black man during the riots in London last year (file picture) Alison Saunders, chief prosecutor for . London, said she had advised the Independent Police Complaints . Commission to charge Pc MacFarlane despite the CPS's decision not to . charge him in January. 'In . March, the complainant's lawyers challenged that decision and, in . accordance with standard CPS practice, Grace Ononiwu, Deputy Chief Crown . Prosecutor for CPS London, directed that the case be reviewed by a more . senior lawyer who was not previously involved. 'That review is now complete and the conclusion, based on all the evidence now available, is that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction to charge Pc MacFarlane with a racially aggravated public order offence contrary to Section 4a of the Public Order Act 1986 and Section 31 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Review: Met Commissioner Bernard-Hogan Howe has appeared before MPs over the force's review of racist allegations . 'When a review shows a previous decision . not to prosecute is wrong, it is open to the CPS to rectify that error . by bringing new proceedings.' Ms Saunders said the original CPS decision was 'regrettable', adding that a prosecution was necessary to maintain public confidence. Pc MacFarlane was suspended from his duties following a review of the mobile phone footage. The arrested man, named as Mauro Demetrio, 21, from Beckton, east London, was held on suspicion of drug-driving in August last year but no action was later taken. The charging announcement came as Met Commissioner Bernard-Hogan Howe appeared before MPs over the force's review of racist allegations. Ms Saunders said: 'As Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, I have taken the decision in this case that, as well as there being sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, and a prosecution being in the public interest, a prosecution is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the criminal justice system. 'That is the test I must apply under the Code for Crown Prosecutors when reinstituting a prosecution. 'Accordingly, I have advised the Independent Police Complaints Commission to charge Pc MacFarlane. 'It is regrettable that the original decision was wrong, but I hope the action taken and my decision today demonstrates the willingness of the CPS to review its decisions independently and swiftly and to take appropriate action where necessary.' An additional charge of assault relating to an allegation of 'strangulation' will not be pursued, the CPS said. There are now 11 separate racism allegations under investigation at the Met Police involving 10 police officers . Ms Saunders added: 'However, having now had opportunity to consider all available evidence, including the statements of others in the van alongside the recording, the lawyer reviewing the case concluded that the inconsistencies in the various accounts of what happened were such that no additional charge could properly be added. 'The inconsistencies included a dispute over the identity of the officer who took hold of the complainant - the complainant said that this was one officer but all other witnesses dispute this. 'There is also inconsistency over why the officer, who does accept that he took hold of the complaint, did so. He and other witnesses say it was in response to the complainant's apparent aggression and in self-defence. 'I agree with the conclusion that, in the circumstances, there is insufficient evidence to meet the Code test for bringing charges.' Another allegation of abuse by a police officer against a youth at Forest Gate police station remains under consideration, the CPS said.",Pc Alex MacFarlane allegedly racially abused a 21-year-old man last summer .
"By . Rob King . UPDATED: . 13:20 EST, 6 March 2012 . A diabetic who suffered horrific burns when she lost consciousness while her foot was under a hot tap for six hours is recovering - after healthy skin was sprayed back on. Laura Ritchie, 52, who has been told on several occasions that she could lose her leg, must now wait a week to find out whether the treatment, which took less than half an hour, has worked. It is the first time the treatment has ever been given to a patient in Scotland. Mrs Ritchie, from Aberdeen, believes the wound has shrunk . significantly since the end of last year and is able to walk a few . steps with a walking frame. 'Now I feel like I'm a human being again with a life,' she said. Recovery: Laura Ritchie is back at home after being the first person in Scotland to receive ReCell spray-on-skin treatment . Mrs Ritchie has been wheelchair bound for two years since she suffered a hypoglycaemic attack in the . bath and her foot came to rest under the scalding water. Her son, Peter, 30, returned home to find her slumped over the side of the bath and gave her Glucagon to raise her blood sugar levels. As it began to take effect, however, she screamed in agony and he called an ambulance. Mrs Ritchie suffered such severe burns that her lower left leg has failed to heal . despite two skin graft attempts. But consultant vascular surgeon Paul Bachoo, at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, has made history in Scotland by using ReCell spray-on skin technology to treat her. The procedure works by harvesting cells from a postage stamp-sized . piece of donor skin. Mrs Ritchie, who has had Type 1 diabetes for 40 years, said she had been in excruciating pain before the treatment. 'It was getting to the point where, however hard I tried to keep positive, it seemed never-ending,' she said. “I can’t tell you what the pain was like. It was unbearable. 'I was on four or five kinds of painkillers constantly. 'The . quality of life was unbearable. The nurses were in every day - in the . beginning, it took three nurses nearly an hour to dress it. 'I thought my life was over. It was like I was looking out of a window and saying where has it gone? 'But now I feel I’m a human being again with a life.' Mrs Ritchie has also been receiving another revolutionary therapy since December - Extracorporeal Shockwave Treatment. Despite . being readily available in parts of Europe, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary is . the only NHS hospital in Scotland to be equipped with the machine, which in Mr Bachoo’s words 'gets the wound to a point where it can think about healing'. It . is hoped that with these two treatments, Laura’s leg wound will . eventually close up, allowing her to finally resume her life as it was . two years ago. Agony: Laura Ritchie scalded her leg in the bath two years ago (pictured) after she had a diabetic attack . Mrs Ritchie said: 'After the first shockwave treatment, I could not tell you where my pain had gone, but it wasn’t there. 'When I went back the second time, the wound had shrunk from about 20cm to 15cm.' Thanking the staff who treated her, she added: . 'I just feel so strongly about this. The first few weeks I was going round telling everyone about it. 'I can imagine how people must have felt when penicillin came about. What a difference. 'The loss of pain is one of the first signs it’s working. I feel nothing when they do it. 'It’s like someone is scratching something that has been wanting to be itched for a long time.' Mr Bachoo, clinic lead for vascular surgery, . said the treatment could be very successful for a certain group of . people, including diabetics like Laura. He said: 'The clinical knowledge is that in a range of patients whose wounds were not healing, it works. 'It transforms wounds from infected, contaminated, painful, smelly sores to clean and healthy ones that are ready to heal. 'It can transform a person’s quality of life remarkably. ReCell technology has been around for seven years but few surgeons perform it. Last month, the mother of two-year-old Zed Merrick told how he was making a remarkable recovery after he received the treatment for burns he suffered when he knocked over a cup of tea at their home in Lincolnshire. Doctors at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, worked for two hours to give Zed a spray-on skin.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:00 EST, 16 February 2012 . North Korea's new leader celebrated his late father's 70th birthday today with a spectacular military parade - just days after internet rumours suggested he himself had been assassinated. Proving you cannot believe everything you read on Twitter, Kim Jong Un appeared alive and well on state television in a dark Mao-style suit. Smiling and looking happy, a stark contrast to his sombre appearance at his father's funeral two months ago, he bowed deeply before a portrait of Kim Jong Il in Kumsusan Memorial Palace in the capital Pyongyang. Scroll down for video... He's alive! Kim Jong Un's appearance scotched rumours that he was dead once and for all . Honour: Kim Jong Un marks the birthday of his late father during a series of celebrations today . Celebration: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (bottom right) marked his later father's birthday by appearing at a massive military parade . Rumours of the new leader's murder originated in China when a . man working near the North Korean embassy in Beijing noted how 30 . cars were outside the building and asked: 'Did something happen in . Korea?' Putting pay to those rumours, Kim Jong Un appeared in front of hundreds of senior officials, military leaders and citizens in tribute to his father. Outside the palace, a huge crowd of North . Korean soldiers lined up in neat rows on a sunny but frigid day, . listening to speeches praising the Kim family. Later, the new leader and other officials watched as goose-stepping soldiers marched by, followed by military jeeps and trucks carrying artillery guns and rocket launchers. Fireworks exploded, military music boomed and people waved artificial pink and red flowers. Happy times: North Korean soldiers share a laugh during the celebrations to make Kim Jong Il's birthday . Impressive: Fireworks exploded over the heads of North Korean soldiers as they marked their former leaders birthday . Tribute: North Koreans laid flowers at Kim Il Sung Square beneath a large portrait of the late leader Kim Jong Il today . Scramble: Senior North Korean military members pictured approaching an area where new North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other military and political leaders were standing . Kim Jong Il ruled with an iron fist for 17 years, a period that included a famine in the 1990s that killed hundreds of thousands of people and protracted tensions over the nation's drive to build nuclear weapons. Food shortages persist in North Korea . and relations with South Korea are at their lowest point in years. But . since Kim's death two months ago, expressions of mourning and adoration . have been common in Pyongyang. After the funeral, Kim Jong Un was named supreme commander of the country's 1.2 million-member military. State media and officials have praised Kim Jong Il as a strong but benevolent leader, while calling Kim Jong Un the unquestioned choice to succeed him in this socialist nation of 24 million. 'We will faithfully uphold the 'military-first' leadership of our respected supreme commander and comrade with our guns,' military General Staff chief Ri Yong Ho said in a speech. 'Let's dedicate our lives to protect Kim Jong Un,' troops in the plaza roared. Parade: New leader Kim Jong Un reviewed a procession of thousands of soldiers who vowed to protect him with their lives . Joyous: The bright colours exhibited in the celebrations contrast greatly to the dull shades used following Kim Jong Il's death . At Kim Il Sung Square, the main plaza in the capital, North Koreans bowed and laid flowers, including red 'kimjongilia' begonias, at a portrait of Kim Jong Il hanging on the Grand People's Study House. Among them was Paek Won Chol, who described himself as a 'soldier and disciple' of Kim Jong Il. 'I will devote my all for the building of a powerful and prosperous nation' under Kim Jong Un, Paek said. Joy: The parade was just one event taking place to celebrate Kim Jong Il's death. New poems have been written in his honour and slogans etched into mountains . Show of strength: Outside the palace, a huge crowd of North Korean soldiers lined up in neat rows on a sunny but frigid day, listening to speeches praising the Kim family . Today's memorial could serve as closure to North Korea's mourning ahead of important nuclear talks next week with the United States, said John Delury, an assistant professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Studies in South Korea. Kim Jong Il's death halted discussions between Pyongyang and Washington on much-needed food aid in exchange for nuclear disarmament. North Korea has tested two atomic devices since 2006. A U.S. envoy will hold talks with North Korea on its nuclear program in Beijing next week, the first such negotiations since Kim's death. 'There were a lot of balls in the air when Kim Jong Il died, so things froze,' Delury said.

Momentous: Fireworks exploded, military music boomed and people waved artificial pink and red flowers during the day of celebration . Bowing down: North Koreans honoured the birthday of their late leader at Kim Il Sung Square today . 'The timing of this public ceremony ... allows North Korea to make a last major public expression of grief as part of moving on and getting back to a lot of orders of business.' In a burst of propaganda, composers have crafted new odes to Kim Jong Il, while sculptors have chiseled slogans honouring him into the sides of mountains. His birthday was renamed 'Day of the Shining Star', and this week he was accorded a new title: Generalissimo. The North's leadership has sought to portray Kim as a defender of the nation, which has remained in a technical state of war with the United States since the 1950s, when the Korean War left the Korean peninsula divided into north and south. During his rule, Kim focused on building nuclear weapons, calling them necessary protection against the U.S. military presence in South Korea even as they drew sanctions. Kim Yong Nam, North Korea's nominal head of state, praised Kim Jong Il on Tuesday for 'turning our country into an invincible one that can never be defeated and has a nuclear deterrent.' Applause: North Koreans clap as a large screen shows a portrait of the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, during a concert in Pyongyang to commemorate his death and what would have been his 70th birthday . Mourning: A screen shows 'devastated' North Koreans in the days following Kim Jong Il's death, during a concert in Pyongyang to commemorate his 70th birthday . Portraits of Kim show him smiling beatifically, and a stamp issued following his death captures him sharing a laugh with Kim Jong Un. Those images are replicated across Pyongyang in huge portraits hanging at the People's Palace of Culture, a flower exhibition featuring his kimjongilia begonias and at a book fair at the Grand People's Study House. It's an image that contrasts with Kim Jong Il in his later years, as he reportedly recovered from a stroke and battled chronic illness. He often appeared in public wearing a heavy parka and dark sunglasses. Last month, top leaders of the Workers' Party announced that Kim's body would lie in state at Kumsusan, where his father, North Korea founder Kim Il Sung, already lies in state. Officials said later today that the building had been renamed Kumsusan Palace of the Sun. Kim Jong Il has often been referred to as the 'Sun of the 21st Century' in state propaganda, which calls Kim Il Sung's birthday the 'Day of the Sun'. Sombre: The colourful display of today's celebration are staggeringly different to the mourning observed by North Koreans following Kim Jong Il's death (pictured here) Stricken: North Koreans were seen crying in the streets in the aftermath of Kim Jong Il's death, but many questioned the veracity of their actions . While North Korea's leadership has venerated Kim Jong Il, it has also emphasised his son's links to his revered grandfather, whom Kim Jong Un resembles in looks and style. Shedding the quiet demeanour he displayed when his father was alive, Kim Jong Un wasted no time in asserting himself as the new leader, making energetic visits to military units seen as important to his father's 'military first' policy. At Kumsusan palace today, he strolled slowly onto a reviewing stand beneath another large portrait of his father. The crowd then paid silent tribute to Kim Jong Il, heads bowed, while a breeze ruffled the flags and Kim Jong Un's hair. During the military parade, Kim appeared relaxed, laughing and speaking with Ri Yong Ho and Armed Forces Minister Kim Yong Chun. Among others who paid their respects with Kim were Kim Yong Nam; Premier Choe Yong Rim; Kang Sok Ju, a vice premier who was Kim Jong Il's key foreign policy adviser; and Kim Ok, a woman believed to have been Kim Jong Il's companion.","Colourful display in contrast to sombre funeral scenes two months earlier .

"Came to international attention in November of last year for her outrageous police mugshot showing her enhanced backside . Born a man but living as a woman, Oneal Morris denies all charges of practicing medicine without a license . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:38 EST, 6 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:25 EST, 6 April 2012 . The transgender 'fake doctor' at the centre of the 'toxic tush' botched cosmetic surgery cases in Florida has pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought against her. Thirty-two-year-old Oneal Morris denied three counts of practicing medicine without a license in a written plea to a Broward, Florida judge. Prosecutors say that Morris injected a substance consisting of cement, Fix-A-Flat, mineral oil and superglue into her two of her 'patients' in a Dania Beach motel room in 2009. Toxic Tush: Oneal Morris, 32, has pleaded not guilty to the latest charges brought against her for illegally practicing medicine . Born a man but living as a woman, Morris is accused of charging hundreds of dollars to administer the potentially lethal shots, which several of her male and female customers allege left them with life-threatening injuries. Coming to national attention after her arresting mugshots showed her with an disproportionately outsized backside, Morris allegedly performed similar procedures on three other women in two Florida counties. Infamous mugshot: The notorious mugshot of Oneal Morris taken following her arrest in November of 2011 . The latest charges relate to Lournise Linton, 41, of Tampa, Pheilia Parker, 36, of Vero Beach and Tiffany Kennedy of Lauderhill. Miss Linton and Miss Parker say that they traveled to meet Morris in a Motel Six in Dania Beach in May of 2009. The pair claim that Morris presented herself as a bone-fide medical professional and was wearing a nurses uniform and was carrying a photo ID. However, both women claim the equipment he used to produce the desired 'junk in the trunk' backside implants was not of medical grade and that they almost died as a result of the injections. One of the ladies says she was pumped full of a substance that Morris was carrying in a Pedialyte oral re-hydration bottle. The other lady claims that Morris could not remove the cotton ball from the injection site because it was stuck down by superglue. Both women say they paid upwards of $4000 for the procedures. It is alleged that Oneal Morris would pose as a medical professional complete with standard issue I.D . The other lady, Tiffany Kennedy paid $1000 in 2009 for the work that she says Morris carried out and in fact came to Miss Kennedy's home to carry out the procedure. All three women told investigators on the case that Morris looked and spoke like a medical professional. In an interview with Florida's Sun Sentinel this week, Miss Kennedy's mother, Julie Matthews said that her daughter was always concerned for her looks. 'She always thought that she had to have a bigger rear end,' the mother said Miss Matthews. 'She's perfect the way she is. She's very beautiful.' It was after the procedure that her daughter became ill suffering from a fever and according to doctors came close to death. Miss Matthews said that her daughter came forward to authorities after seeing Morris on television following last years infamous arrest. Junk in their trunks: It is alleged that Oneal Morris would inject a mixture of cement, Fix-A-Flat, mineral oil and superglue into her 'patients' All three women still suffer from serious lingering side effects. However, Morris' attorney Michael Mirer said his client is ready to face down all the charges brought against her. 'My client is looking forward to her day in court,"" said Mr Mirer. 'At this point, I haven't seen any evidence other than what the victims are saying. 'These allegations are from three years ago. I question the timing of charges being brought now.' Also known by her alias the 'Duchess' Oneal Morris was arrested in November of last year along with her alleged assistant Corey Alexander Eubanks. She was accused in Miami-Dade of tricking a Miami Gardens woman into paying for a round of six injections of life threatening chemicals given through a tube hooked to a cooling fridge. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight last year, Morris protested her innocence before this latest round of charges. 'They didn’t catch me doing anything. So they are just allegations. So I’m innocent. I really am innocent or whatever,' said Morris. 'I didn’t do any of these things to these people. Just know these people who are lying are ruining my life. That’s all I have to say.'","Came to international attention in November of last year for her outrageous police mugshot showing her enhanced backside .

Assad vows to aid peace missionBashar Assad's promise to do all he can to ensure the peace plan came as rebels carried out a string of bold attacks, killing two army colonels and kidnapping a high-ranking pilot. The president's condition of an express promise from the opposition to stop attacks could complicate Mr Annan's attempts to bring an end to more than a year of violence that the UN says has killed more than 9,000 people. Syrian president Bashar Assad talks to officials during a tour in the Baba Amr neighbourhood of Homs earlier this week . The opposition has cautiously welcomed Annan's six-point plan, which calls for Assad's regime to implement a cease-fire. But the opposition is also deeply sceptical Assad will carry it out, believing he has accepted the plan just to win time while his forces continue their assault to crush the uprising. Armed rebels are unlikely to stop fighting unless offensives by security forces halt. In speeches at the Arab leaders' annual summit in Iraq's capital, Baghdad, yesterday, many made clear they felt the burden was on Assad's regime to halt the fighting.

'The Syrian government is required today to listen to the voice of reason and wisdom and stop all kinds of violence,' the emir of Kuwait told the gathering. In comments carried on Syria's state news agency, Assad said: 'Syria will spare no effort to make (Annan's) mission a success and hopes it would return security and stability to the country.' But he added that Mr Annan must also get a commitment from armed groups to cease their 'terrorist acts' against the government. Throughout the crisis, Assad's regime has held that it faces not a popular uprising against his rule but a campaign of violence by terrorists.

Throughout the crisis, Assad's regime has held that it faces not a popular uprising against his rule but a campaign of violence by terrorists . Since then, army defectors and protesters who took up weapons have formed militias, initially to protect protesters. But as the bloodshed rose, they turned to seizing pro-opposition neighbourhoods, towns and areas and launching attacks on government forces, usually raids on checkpoints or on army convoys. The new attacks today were particularly bold. In Aleppo, Syria's largest city, gunmen opened fire on two army colonels in the central Bab al-Hadid roundabout, killing them. The state news agency Sana said the four attackers belonged to an 'armed terrorist group'. In eastern Ghouta, a suburb a few kilometres from Damascus, gunmen kidnapped the pilot, a brigadier, while on his way to work, . Rebels also attacked an army truck and killed two soldiers in the central province of Hama, activists said. Fresh clashes also broke out between government troops and army defectors in the north and south, and activists said security forces reportedly killed at least 16 civilians across Syria, including a child and two women. Sana said authorities successfully liberated five military personnel who it said were kidnapped earlier by an 'armed group' in the northern province of Idlib.","William Hague: Funding will help 'hard-pressed' opposition document regime's violations .

Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe's motorcade has been involved in a third fatal road smash in just two weeks. The 88-year-old tyrant's line of official vehicles smashed into a minibus on Sunday, leaving one man dead. The bloody accident happened a fortnight after two people were killed in a single day in two separate smashes involving the presidential motorcade. Rush: Robert Mugabe pictured getting out of his Mercedes which is believed to be part of the longest motorcade in Africa . In the latest incident, reported on the The New Zimbabwe website, a bus passenger was killed and 15 people injured on Sunday afternoon. It happened as Mugabe was being driven in a convoy to the country's capital Harare from his home village of Zvimba. The website said: 'President Robert Mugabe's motorcade was involved in a third accident on Sunday inside two weeks. 'The presidential motorcade was making a brisk return to Harare from Mugabe's rural home in Zvimba when a police lead vehicle sent to clear traffic rammed into a commuter minibus carrying 22 passengers. 'A male passenger in the minibus, known locally as a kombi, died on impact with the police Mercedes while 15 others - including two police officers - were injured.'It is believed Mugabe's lengthy motorcade was speeding the president to the international airport ahead of a scheduled flight to Brazil.Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said the accident happened after the minibus taxi driver ignored the presidential convoy's flashing blue lights.He said: 'The police vehicle was flashing its blue lights. A vehicle travelling in the opposite direction pulled to the side of the road, and unfortunately the kombi driver took the decision to overtake that vehicle and smashed into the police car.' The Zimbabwean president was on his way to a funeral on June 6 when the two previous incidents occurred. Mugabe's motorcade had two accidents on his way to a funeral before the latest incident . First of all, one of the tyrant's outrider . motorbikes killed a homeless man as they rushed the . octogenarian president to a funeral. The independent Daily News reported the . motorbike which knocked down the pedestrian had been the first vehicle . in Mugabe's motorcade, which is reportedly one of the longest in Africa. The newspaper claimed the rest of the . statesman's long chain of vehicles sped by without stopping to help the . victim. The 88-year-old statesman is . traditionally ensconced safely in a luxury Mercedes limousine when he . travels around his poverty-stricken country. The presidential vehicle is . accompanied by more than a dozen others as part of an extensive . motorcade which includes Land Cruisers, security vehicles full of armed . soldiers, high-powered motorcycles and a standby ambulance.

The Daily News reported that several . of the leader's security guards were later injured in a second accident . after a tyre blew out in one of their Land Cruisers. Presidential spokesman George Charamba confirmed the victims of both accidents had been taken to hospital. The motorcade smash comes a decade after Mugabe brought in new laws to ease his passage around Zimbabwe. Since 2002 motorists have been legally required to pull over if they see the presidential car approaching. It is also an offence to gesticulate at the motorcade with the intention of insulting those inside. Offenders have previously been arrested or met with a robust physical response from Mugabe's guards.","A homeless man, security guard and a minibus passenger all die as Robert Mugabe is transported around Zimbabwe .

The United Nations today said it may withdraw from its monitoring mission in Syria after a joint U.S.-Russian call for an immediate end to the conflict. Mission leader Major General Robert Mood, whose 300 unarmed monitors suspended operations on Saturday because of escalating bloodshed, will brief the Security Council later. With civilians trapped by regime shelling of rebel bastions such as the central city of Homs, Mood has urged the government and opposition to let 'women, children, the elderly and the injured to leave conflict zones'.

'In order to stop the bloodshed in Syria, we call for an immediate cessation of all violence,' the two leaders said in a statement after meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico. The leaders added: 'We are united in the belief that the Syrian people should have the opportunity to independently and democratically choose their own future.' Putin told reporters that he and Obama had found 'many common points' on the 15-month-old uprising against President Bashar Assad that monitors say has cost more than 14,400 lives.

Victim: The body of a man, who residents say was killed by shelling, lies in a makeshift hospital in Houla near Homs yesterday . Obama said he and Putin agreed on the need for a 'political process' to halt the conflict and had pledged to work with UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, who has crafted a largely-ignored six-point plan aimed at halting the bloodshed. But there was little sign they had agreed on concrete means to end the conflict, following U.S. frustration at Russia's blocking of Security Council moves against Assad. The United States, Britain and France are working on a new UN Council resolution in which they want to threaten sanctions against Assad. Mourning: Residents gather during the funeral of Hussein Omish, whom protesters say was killed by forces loyal to Assad, in Jubar near Damascus . But Russia, Syria's main international ally, and China have already blocked two resolutions. Moscow news reports, meanwhile, said Russia is preparing to send two amphibious assault ships and marines to the Syrian port of Tartus where Russia has a naval base to ensure the safety of its nationals. The amphibious warships, The Nikolai Filchenkov and The Tsezar Kunikov, are to be sent to Tartus with a 'large' group of marines, Interfax news agency quoted an officer at Russian naval headquarters as saying. There was no official confirmation of the report by Russian authorities. The Tsezar Kunikov can carry 150 troops and armaments including tanks, while The Nikolai Filchenkov can carry up to 1,500 tonnes of cargo and equipment, the report said. Interfax said the ships could be used to evacuate Russian nationals.

Clashes and shelling persisted in several areas of Damascus province, including the towns of Douma and Qudsaya which have been under bombardment for the past five days. In New York, diplomats raised doubts about the viability of the observer mission.

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 03:46 EST, 9 February 2012 . People with Parkinson's disease often suffer from shaking limbs and stiff muscles, which makes moving increasingly difficult. Now scientists have found practising an ancient Chinese martial art could help both their balance and ability to walk. A team from the Oregon Research Institute assigned nearly 200 patients twice weekly sessions of 60 minutes each in either tai chi, resistance-training or stretching. Improvement: Tai chi helped sufferers with balance and walking (posed picture) Those who did the gentle martial art outperformed the stretching and resistance-training groups in tests of balance and length of stride when walking. Those in the tai chi group also experienced fewer falls than the stretchers, and just as many falls as the resistance-trainers. 'These results are clinically significant because they suggest that tai chi, a low-to-moderate impact exercise, may be used, as an add-on to current physical therapies, to address some of the key clinical problems in Parkinson's disease' said lead author Fuzhong Li. 'The improvements in the balance and gait measures that we demonstrated highlight the potential of tai chi-based movements in rehabilitating patients with these types of problems.' Tai chi entails regular practice of deep breathing and relaxation techniques to calm the mind, combined with slow and gentle movements. It is based on tenets in Confucian and Buddhist philosophies that there are two opposing life forces, yin and yang, which govern health. Ill health results from an imbalance in these forces, but it can be corrected by tai chi by improving the flow of internal energy through the whole body, according to these beliefs. Last year, scientists from Hong Kong Polytechnic University found the practice helped elderly patients to avoid dangerous falls. Parkinson's is a progressive motor-system disorder that affects more than 120,000 people in the UK and around one million in the U.S. Symptoms usually appear in people over the age of 50 and include body trembling, stiffness and loss of balance. Drugs and surgery are two possible treatments however there is no known cure.","Tai chi entails regular practice of measured breathing and slow, gentle movements .

Chef Neil Iron allegedly spiked a chocolate mousse with ecstasy which was later eaten by two toddlers, who were both hospitalised . Two toddlers were taken to hospital after eating a chocolate pudding spiked with Ecstasy by a chef who once served the Queen, a court was told. Neil Iron, 32, is accused of lacing desserts with the party drug to ‘liven up’ a birthday celebration at a trendy gastropub. The youngsters were taken ill after their parents took them to the Red Lion in Hoxton, East London, the following day for Sunday lunch. One of the children suffered a ‘pretty severe’ allergic reaction after they shared a chocolate mousse pot, and both were left ‘injured and seriously affected’. Another customer, Charlie Webster, had an ‘out-of-body experience’ after eating two chocolate truffles left over from the party. Iron, a former head chef at the Royal Marsden hospital in Chelsea, once served the Queen and Prince Edward afternoon tea when they opened a rehabilitation centre for cancer patients. He also reached the semi-finals of the National Chef Of The Year awards. Snaresbrook Crown Court was told he began working at the Red Lion, which is popular with families, last September. The three victims were allegedly poisoned after visiting on October 9. The jury was told the two children fell ill after eating a chocolate pot at the end of a roast lunch with their parents. After they were taken to hospital tests on them found traces of cocaine and Ecstasy. Police were called, and they traced the youngsters’ movements back to the pub. Officers informed Iron the next day that the children had been taken ill, and he was arrested later that month. Giving evidence in his defence, Iron claimed that the desserts could have been tampered with at the chaotic party on Saturday night. The chef, who was cautioned last April for cocaine possession, said: ‘It must have been a person from the party because that’s where the food was. I wasn’t in the room, I was in the kitchen.’ Ecstasy dessert: The Red Lion pub in Hoxton, north London, where the children were fed the laced food . Accused: The chef, on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court, denies any wrongdoing . He added that leftovers were brought . to the kitchen by guests at about 1.45am when the party ended. ‘At that . point, there were about six people milling around in the kitchen,’ he . said. ‘Other people were putting food in the fridge as well as me.’ The court heard a chocolate cake made for the party was tested and did not have any traces of drugs. Under cross-examination by prosecutor . Jack Talbot, the chef denied telling the children’s father or Mr Webster . that there were drugs in the truffles. ‘I’m not going to say to someone, . “would you like some drug-laced food products?” when you are about to . sit in my restaurant and consume a lunch,’ he said. Mr Talbot claimed that Iron was lying, . and that guests at the party may have asked him to lace the desserts . with drugs to ‘liven it up’. He said: ‘You made it clear, even if it was . by alluding to it, that they were drug truffles. You told at least Mr . Webster that there were drugs in there.’ Describing how Mr Webster came to eat . the truffles, Iron said: ‘He came into the kitchen and asked where his . dinner was. While he was in the kitchen I took out the tray of truffles . and asked him if he wanted one. He took one, ate it and said “that’s . nice”. ‘Two minutes later his dinner was on . the table. He came in half-way through and asked if he could have . another truffle. I said “help yourself”.’ Iron, from Hoxton, denies three counts of administering poison or a noxious substance with intent. The jury will consider their verdicts today.","Neil Iron, 32, allegedly spiked desserts to 'liven up' a party the night before .

Ticket to ride: Gary Lineker, pictured with his wife Danielle, is chauffeured between Manchester and London after his Match of the Day duties at a cost of £15,000 to the BBC . You might expect someone earning a reputed £2million to be able to foot his own commuting bills. But it seems the BBC has other ideas – and is splashing out more than £15,000 a year to cover Gary Lineker’s travel to work. After finishing each Match of the Day show, the presenter has a chauffeur waiting to drive him from the Corporation’s new studios in Salford to his home in London. The BBC also pays for the former England captain’s first-class train ticket from London to Manchester to begin filming each week. This is despite Lineker, 51, taking home one of the highest salaries at the Corporation. The broadcaster’s official policy is not to pay travel expenses for freelance presenters who live in the South-East and work in Salford – meaning other hosts, such as Radio 5 Live’s Victoria Derbyshire, have to meet these costs themselves. But Lineker’s contract was signed before the Corporation’s move to the Greater Manchester site was confirmed. It is understood to have guaranteed to provide his travel to and from the programme. Since the move, however, Lineker’s 200-mile chauffeur-driven trip home from work can take up to four hours and costs around £350. He makes the journey 40 times a year, leaving his employer with an annual bill of about £14,000. His rail tickets are thought to cost a further £1,500 every 12 months.

Gift of a lifetime: 83-year-old Nicholas Crace is the oldest living kidney donor in the UK and the oldest person to give a kidney to a stranger . At the age of 83, most of us would be grateful just to have our health. But not only is Nicholas Crace fighting fit, he is using his good condition to help others. The former charity director has become Britain’s oldest living kidney donor by giving his organ to a stranger. Mr Crace decided to be an 'altruistic donor' – someone who donates to a patient on the NHS waiting list whom they do not know – after his wife Brigid died last year. After researching how he could help others, he found he was 43 years too old to be a bone marrow donor and 13 years too old to give blood, despite donating 57 times previously. But when tests showed his kidneys were functioning as well as a 40-year-old’s, he knew he had to donate. 'I couldn’t have lived with myself with the knowledge that I had had the chance of changing someone’s life and turned it down,' he said. 'Giving a small part of me to someone else will make little difference to my life but a huge difference to someone else’s. 'It was an easy decision for me to make.’ Mr Crace, who volunteers as a driver for a hospice, was moved to act after discovering what life was like for patients on the transplant list who are having dialysis. New lease of life: A kidney patient will be able to come off dialysis thanks to Mr Crace (File pic) He said: 'All this can be put right by the donation of a healthy kidney.' Mr Crace, from Overton, Hampshire, had the operation at the Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, and was back bicycling and mowing the lawn a week later. 'Giving a small part of me to someone else will make little difference to my life but a huge difference to someone else's - it was an easy decision for me to make' Because he is an altruistic donor, he will never know who received his  kidney, but he has been told the recipient is 'doing well'. Consultant surgeon Sam Dutta, who performed the operation, said: 'A living donor kidney performs better, works quicker and lasts longer than one from a deceased donor. 'An altruistic donor coming forward is an amazing thing for us. The recipient just gets a new lease of life.' Mr Crace's operation took three hours and the surgeon congratulated him as his kidneys were in perfect condition. He said: 'In fact, given a halter, he would gladly have led me into the winner's enclosure at the Smithfield Show to have a rosette pinned on.' Generous: Mr Crace, 83, from Overton, Hampshire, had an operation to remove his kidney and was back bicycling and mowing the lawn a week later . Annabel Ferriman, chairwoman of Give a Kidney - One's Enough, a charity dedicated to raising awareness of altruistic donation, said: 'Altruistic donors are very special people. 'They have the imagination to understand the suffering that people go through on dialysis while waiting for a transplant and the courage and generosity to do something about it.' The process involved Mr Crace undergoing a number of tests during 14 hospital visits in a six-month period. Almost 100 people have donated a kidney since the altruistic living donor scheme was launched in the UK in 2006 and in 2011 a further 1,000 people gave a kidney to a relative or friend.","Nicholas Crace's kidneys found to function as well as those of someone in their 40s .

Bankers at bailed-out Lloyds relaxed from the strains of Britain's worst economic downturn for a century by escaping to a luxury spa. A dozen senior executives were sent on breaks at Champneys to show them how to be better 'hunter-gatherers in the corporate jungle', it emerged today. The resort, more commonly associated with Premier League footballers and celebrities, created a 'bespoke programme' to protect the bosses from 'bail out, burn out or being booted out'. The executives were advised on the latest techniques used in 'physique management', the skills needed to be 'alpha males and females' and even anti-ageing methods. It is unknown how much the break at Champneys' Tring resort in Hertfordshire cost, but comparable stays start at £995 per person. The shocking revelations will outrage millions of hardworking Britons, who learnt the grim news this week that the UK has plunged into the first double-dip recession since 1975. Lloyds Banking Group, which is around 40% owned by the UK taxpayer, to whom it owes about £20 billion, sent staff on a two-day trip intended to show them how to 'manage their chaotic lives', the Guardian reported. Tim Bean, the celebrity trainer, instructed the 12 bankers about the 'little-known, but highly effective methods of the UK's leading physique and corporate longevity specialists'. Luxury: Champneys resort in Tring, where Lloyds bankers were sent . He gave the 12 bankers tips on 'executive nutrition' and devised a workout programme for each of them. Mr Bean, who uses the nickname 'The Merciless Mr Bean', revealed one seminar called Hunter-Gatherers in the Corporate Jungle was arranged to 're-equip them with the skills of alpha males and females'. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, told MailOnline: 'Taxpayers are still picking up the pieces from bailing out the banks. 'Bosses at those institutions cannot carry on living the high life when it’s taxpayers who are propping them up. 'Lloyds chiefs should focus on paying back what they borrowed rather than spending their time on corporate spa breaks.' A spokesman for Lloyds said: 'It is important to stress that this was a free one-off event that a small group attended last year at the request of a customer who wanted feedback on a new programme they planned to launch. 'It was arranged by a senior executive who no longer works for the group.' But Stephen Purdew, chief executive of Champneys, told the Guardian: 'Of course they bloody paid for it.' Spa to the stars: Champneys created a . 'bespoke programme' for Lloyds bankers . The bankers arrived at the Tring spa, which is surrounded by 170 acres of parkland, on November 3 - the day after Antonio Horta-Osorio, the Lloyds' chief executive, went on a month's sick leave after being diagnosed with extreme fatigue and stress due to overwork. As part of his treatment, Mr Horta-Osorio checked into the Priory clinic, where he slept under constant medical supervision for eight days and nights. The Lloyds bankers got up at 6am on November 4 to attend a 'dawn-breaker exercise class' and later went to a 'build before you burn' session, which advised them not to take on heavy workloads in a rush. At the end of the day, they were encouraged to 'de-stress or detox' in the spa, where they were able to choose from more than 100 'relaxing, energising and rejuvenating' treatments. The names of the Lloyds employees have not been disclosed but Mr Bean said they were an 'executive team'. It is not the first time that a stay at Champneys has landed somebody in the public eye in hot water. Sir Paul Stephenson quit as commissioner of the Metropolitan Police after it emerged he accepted £12,000 of free hospitality from Champneys. At the time, Neil Wallis, the former News of the World executive editor arrested in connection with the phone-hacking scandal, had been working as a PR consultant for the spa. Last December, it emerged Lloyds sent ten bosses to comedy school to brush up on their leadership skills. The bank signed up for a two-day workshop with The Comedy School in London, as part of a six-month training scheme for department heads. Among the courses offered by the school, from around £75 per person for a half day, were improvisation classes and lessons in clowning.

Adrian's Law would ensure every pupil over 16 would be given at least one session on becoming a donor. It would be named after Adrian Sudbury, a 27-year-old reporter, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, who died after a two-year battle with leukaemia.

The report, on tech site CNET, said that Apple was intending to move from simple 'generations' of tablets to a naming system similar to iPhone's, with its iPhone 4S. Sites such as The Verge have previously reported that the new tablet would be called iPad HD. The website iPadHD.com still exists, though, and its owner has not been contacted by Apple. 'He told us that he's never been contacted by Apple about the domain in the years he's held on to it. That includes the last few weeks,' said CNET. CNET also points out that Apple has pushed ahead with names in the past despite their being owned by other companies. When iPhone launched in 2007, the name was owned by Cisco Systems. Whatever the name, the device will be unveiled on March 7 at a special even in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The invitation says, 'We have something you really have to see. And touch.' The invitation shows a finger over an iPad screen, pointing to the Calendar app, which is set to March 7. Apple has not confirmed what it will be launching at the event. Other rumours claim that Apple will introduce new technologies such as its upcoming Apple TV or a smaller model of iPad at the event. These seem unlikely, as information about the new iPad has been widely leaked from Apple's factories, and there has been no sign of all-new technologies such as an Apple-branded television. The new iPad models are expected to offer a much higher resolution Full HD screen. Bloomberg . reports that iPad 3 processor . will be a 'quad-core' device, a step that would put Apple's tablet ahead . of competing devices such as Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 in terms of . computing power, and enable a new generation of high-powered apps. The new version of Apple's hit tablet computer will be unveiled at a special event in San Francisco on March 7, according to reports . Tech site MacRumors claims that the device will be 'near identical' to iPad 2, which . tallies with other leaks from Apple accessory makers.

EU foreign minister Baroness Ashton is facing calls to resign after appearing to use the fatal shootings of three Jewish schoolchildren in France to criticise Israeli policy in Gaza. In a speech on Palestinian affairs in Brussels, the British EU official suggested that the shootings outside a Jewish school in Toulouse were the same as the deaths of children inadvertently killed in Israeli attacks on Palestinian militants. Lady Ashton also seemingly compared the deaths in Gaza to the slaughter of innocents in Syria, the rampage by a gunman in Norway last year in which dozens of teenagers were killed and the bus crash in Switzerland that killed 22 Belgian schoolchildren a week ago. EU foreign policy chief Baroness Ashton, pictured here on Monday with Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority Salam Fayyad, is under fire after likening the Toulouse school shooting to troubles in Gaza suffered by Palestinian children . Coffins of the dead lie in shrouds. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a . statement that he was incensed by Ashton's comments about the tragedy . She said: ‘When we remember young . people who have been killed in all sorts of terrible circumstances – the . Belgian children having lost their lives in a terrible tragedy and when . we think of what happened in Toulouse, when we remember what happened . in Norway a year ago, when we know what is happening in Syria, when we . see what is happening in Gaza and in different parts of the world – we . remember young people and children who lose their lives.’ The Israeli government demanded that . Lady Ashton step down, with defence minister Ehud Barak denouncing the . mention of Gaza as inappropriate and demanding a retraction. He said: ‘The comparison made by . Ashton between what is happening in Gaza to what happened in Toulouse, . and what is going on in Syria every day, is outrageous and has . absolutely no grounding in reality.’ Israel’s interior minister Eli Yishai . said Lady Ashton’s statement ‘further harms the ability of the EU to be . an honest broker’ in the Middle East, adding: ‘She can no longer serve . in her position.’ Tragic: Rabbi . Jonathan Sandler, 30, the Jewish studies teacher shot dead along with . his sons (left) and Miriam Monsonego, (right) the eight-year-old . daughter of the school's headteacher, who also died . He was joined in his calls for a retraction by Avigdor Lieberman, Israel’s foreign affairs minister. A spokesman for Lady Ashton, who was a . surprise appointment to the new post of EU High Representative for . Foreign Affairs in 2009, claimed the remarks had been grossly distorted. ‘In her remarks, the High . Representative referred to tragedies taking the lives of children around . the world and drew no parallel whatsoever between the circumstances of . the Toulouse attack and the situation in Gaza,’ he said. But that explanation was not accepted . by Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said she wrongly . sought to draw a parallel between the calculated murder of children and . Palestinian casualties who have died in attacks on adult terrorists in . Gaza. Too young: Aryeh Sandler (left) who was killed alongside his father and brother Gavriel (right) ‘What especially outrages me is the . comparison between a targeted massacre of children and the surgical . defensive actions of the IDF [Israel Defence Forces], intended to strike . at terrorists using children as human shields,’ he said. Tory MP James Clappison, vice-chairman . of the Conservative Friends of Israel, said: ‘It is entirely . inappropriate for her to make a comparison between events in France and . Gaza when she is speaking as the EU’s foreign minister. She needs to . think again.’ Downing Street launched  a lukewarm defence of  Lady Ashton. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘I’m not entirely sure that was the comparison she was making.’ He said Baroness Ashton’s team ‘feel her remarks were taken out of context’.","EU chief came under fire for taking luxury break at a five-star hotel in .

"By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 13:49 EST, 21 November 2011 . Before Marilyn Monroe became famed for her platinum blonde locks, she set off to find stardom with her natural honey-hued hair. And these are the photographs from Marilyn Monroe's first professional shoot that show off her natural beauty that consequently led her to celebrity status. The photographs, of the then 19-year-old, are now to be sold after the legendary snapper Joseph Jasgur passed away. First professional photoshoot: Marilyn Monroe, then called Norma Jeane, pictured by the late Joseph Jasgur when she was 19-years-old in West Hollywood . The pictures of the star, then called Norma Jeane, show the young hopeful in a side street, unrecognisable from the blonde bombshell she would become. The photos, which are being sold with copyright and include many other snaps of the model, could fetch nearly a million dollars in the U.S. when they are sold. Jasgur was commissioned in 1946 by the Blue Book agency to take pictures of various aspiring models, among them the brown-haired Norma Jeane Dougherty. The pictures show her in a side street in West Hollywood behind Beverly Boulevard and she is wearing a jumper, black hat and is slightly plump in the face. It was these snaps that Norma Jeane presented to Ben Lyon, the casting director at 20th Century Fox, who signed the wannabe and turned her into Marilyn Monroe. Up for sale: The photos, which are being sold with copyright and include many other snaps of the model, could fetch nearly a million dollars when they are sold . The pictures are believed to give the . truest depiction of the woman who rose to the very summit of American . society and died aged just 36. There . are dozens of pictures of Monroe taken by Jasgur in the sale as well as . release forms signed by Monroe for her first assignments. There . is also a letter from 1945 from Monroe to her half-sister saying how . she wanted to become a model and that her then husband Jimmy was . supportive. Darren . Julien, of Julien's auction house in California in the US, which is . selling the photos, said the archive was included in a huge sale of . photographs. He said: ‘Among the archive of Joseph Jasgur are the first pictures of Marilyn Monroe taken professionally. Natural beauty: The photographs show the young hopeful in a side street in Hollywood, unrecognisable from the blonde bombshell she would become . Transformation: Marilyn after she morphed into a blonde bombshell . ‘Jasgur . died about a year-and-a-half ago and his archive is being sold by the . executor of his estate and these pictures come with copyright - it is a . unique opportunity. ‘In 1946 the Blue Book agency commissioned Jasgur to take some pictures of their models. ‘He did some of them in a group together then did some individually of Norma Jeane, as she was known then. ‘These led to her career taking off and prove that the camera loved her before the world did. ‘The early photos are fascinating because they show Marilyn Monroe before she found fame and some shots so the confidence of later years and others reveal a more timid woman. ‘And the look is in contrast to the platinum blonde which is how people usually remember her. They were highly distributed so the pictures are not that well known. ‘Also in the sale are release forms signed by Marilyn and an important letter to her sister telling how she wanted to be a model. ‘We expect the archive to go for anywhere between $200 and a million dollars.’ The sale is on December 1-2.

"By . Oliver Pickup . UPDATED: . 09:55 EST, 12 September 2011 . Following last week's news that a convoy of dozens of vehicles trucked south from Libya to neighbouring Niger, carrying Muammar Gaddafi's closest supporters - if not the 69-year-old despot himself - it has been reported that one of his sons has also now crossed the border. A government spokesman for the large, landlocked West African country - over 80 per cent of which is the Sahara Desert - confirmed that 37-year-old Saadi Gaddafi, a former footballer in Italy, has also fled. The fugitive dictator's son, who apparently arrived in Niger with nine other people, is one of the most high-profile figures from his regime to have left Libya, if the reports from Justice Minister Amadou Morou are to be believed. Scroll down for a video report about Saadi Gaddafi's flight to Niger . Al-Saadi Gaddafi, pictured in front of his father, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2005, has reportedly fled from Libya to Niger . Colonel Gaddafi's third son became known to the wider world when, in 2003, he signed for Italian club Perugia, where he played only one match before failing a drug test. Formerly on the board of the Italian footballing giants Juventus - of which 7.5 per cent is owned by a Libyan consortium - he was also captain of the Libya national football team, captain of his home club in Tripoli, and president of the Libyan Football Federation. According to the official, Saadi's convoy of vehicles were travelling south towards the outpost of Agadez, where other fleeing Libyan loyalists are believed to be holed up in a hotel. 'I wish to announce that one of Gaddafi's sons - Saadi Gaddafi - was intercepted in the north of Niger by a patrol of the Nigerian military,' Mr Morou said of the ex-Serie A and international footballer, and businessman. He said Saadi 'has no status at all' in Niger, indicating that he has not been granted refugee status, which would guarantee him certain rights. The pro-Gaddafi convoy in Niger are reportedly in a hotel in Agadez, Niger, at the moment. It is thought they could move on to Burkina Faso . In Tripoli, rebel forces reportedly captured Libya's former prime minister and Gaddafi's head of external intelligence service, Abu Zayd Dourd . Since last week, several convoys carrying senior officials of the former Libyan regime as well as civilians and soldiers have made their way across the porous desert border into Niger. Among them were several of Gaddafi's top military officers, including his chief-of-security and the head of his southern command. Niger has faced increasing scrutiny for allowing the former regime members on to its soil, and al-Saadi's arrival will likely intensify international pressure on the country to cooperate with Libya's new rulers. They want all Gaddafi's sons - and Gaddafi himself, who is on the run - to be handed over for trial. Last week, the U.S. urged Niger to detain any individuals who may be subject to prosecution in Libya, as well as to confiscate their weapons and impound any state property, such as money or jewels, that were illegally taken out of the country. While some senior former regime officials have managed to escape, Libya's new leaders have arrested several former high-ranking regime officials since the then-rebel fighters swept into Tripoli on August 21, effectively bring an end to Gaddafi's nearly 42-year rule. Yesterday, anti-Gaddafi forces in Tripoli captured the former head of the regime's external intelligence service, Abu Zayd Dourda, said Anes Sharif, a spokesman for Tripoli's military council. A long-time Gaddafi insider, Mr Dourda also served as prime minister in the 1990s. As Libya's new leaders move to exert their authority in Tripoli, forces loyal to Gaddafi continue to hold out in three strongholds - Sirte on the Mediterranean coast, Sabha in the southern desert, and Bani Walid south east of Tripoli. According to Al Jazeera, a pro-Gaddafi radio station in Bani Walid is urging residents to rise up against the revolutionaries, promising 'the prettiest girls' in town as a reward.","37-year-old son 'has no status' in Niger - not guaranteed refugee status .

Today, President Obama named Dartmouth president Jim Yong Kim as the White House’s nominee to lead the World Bank, thought by some to be an unconventional pick. Mr Obama said Dr Kim, a Korean-born physician and pioneer in the treatment of HIV, AIDS and tuberculosis, has the breadth of experience on development issues needed to carry out the financial institution's anti-poverty mission. But despite the seriousness of the role, Dr Kim is well known at the New Hampshire Ivy League school for his sense of humour. Only last year, he debuted as a rapping spaceman for the school’s annual talent show. Scroll down for videos . Serious and silly: Dr Jim Yong Kim looked sombre as Mr Obama nominated him to helm the World Bank (left), and full of levity while performing at a Dartmouth talent show last year (right) Futuristic: Dr Kim donned a white jacket, LED shirt, and glow sticks for his appearance in the Dartmouth Idol video . Dance dance revolution: Dr Kim looked at home rapping and dancing with the students in the video . In the video, Dr Kim offers a nod to the Black Eyed Peas in a futuristic rendition of Time Of My Life from the movie Dirty Dancing. He is seen alongside Dartmouth students rapping, singing, and wearing a space-age getup of a white leather jacket and green glow sticks. But despite the bouts of silliness, Dr Kim has an impressive resume – including an MD from Harvard Medical School and  a PhD in anthropology, also from Harvard, and received the coveted MacArthur grant in 2003. Mr Obama, speaking from the White House, acknowledged Dr Kim’s credentials: 'It is time for a development professional to lead the world's largest development agency.' He was flanked by Dr Kim, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Meanwhile, Angola, Nigeria and South Africa have endorsed the nomination of Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a respected economist and diplomat, as a candidate to take over the bank when Robert Zoellick steps down in June. 'The endorsement is in line with the belief that the appointment of the leadership of the World Bank and its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, should be merit-based, open and transparent,' the three said in a statement. It was a rare example of unity among countries often at loggerheads as they strive for dominance on the continent. Departing: They were also joined by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner (left) as Mr Obama made the announcement at the White House . A spokeswoman for U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs said he was withdrawing his nomination in support of Dr Kim. 'Professor Sachs supports Dr Kim 100 per cent and with complete enthusiasm,' spokeswoman Erin Trowbridge said. The United States has held the presidency since the bank's inception after World War II, and a European has always headed the IMF. Brazil would like to nominate former Colombian finance minister Jose Antonio Ocampo, but said it cannot do so without Colombia's support, which now looks unlikely. While Mr Ocampo had agreed to stand and Brazil was willing to nominate him, Colombian Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said on Thursday his country was instead focusing on a bid for the presidency of the International Labour Organization. He said that effort had a greater chance of success than going for the World Bank job because Colombia already held the top post at the Inter-American Development Bank. Russia, a member of the so-called BRICs caucus of large emerging market economies, has refrained from publicly backing a non-U.S. candidate and instead called for a greater role for them in top management at international financial institutions. Although the World Bank board would like to reach a consensus, Washington retains the largest single voting share and could expect the support of European nations and Japan, the bank's second-largest voting member.

A young British driver taking part in an elite car rally to Verbier has allegedly been caught doing 113mph in a 50mph zone on a Swiss road. Former public schoolboy William Colebrook, 23, was stopped by police on the final leg of the tour to the upmarket ski resort from London. He was behind the wheel of a black two-seater Audi R8 sports car - the same kind of car driven by Prince Harry - which has been impounded. 'Badass': Former public schoolboy William Colebrook was allegedly caught speeding at 113mph in a 5mph zone in Switzerland while taking part in an exclusive supercar rally . Fun-loving: Picture taken from Will Colebrook's Facebook page shows him enjoying a cocktail with another friend, named as Emily Jenkins . The car is capable of doing 0-62mph in 3.9 seconds and has a top speed of 196mph. Colebrook, who is a student at Oxford Brookes University and a former pupil of Tonbridge School, Kent, was taking part in the 2012 DodgeBall Winter Rally, along with eight other drivers. He is due to appear in court today. Police spokesman Jean Marie Bornet said: 'The driver of an Audi was stopped on a three-lane section of road where overtaking is allowed within the 80km/h limit. He was stopped at 182km/h. 'His driving was not acceptable. Other people were put in danger. It was a busy day on the roads. 'The car was immediately impounded. His driving licence would have been taken if he was Swiss.' He said the UK authorities will be made aware of the incident. He . added: 'The case has been passed to the Ministere Public du Bas Valais . in St Maurice. He will pay an initial fine guarantee while the case is . being dealt with. 'The . police have valued the car at 227,000chf (£157,000) without the . modifications. This figure will be used by the judge when deciding the . level of fine to impose.' Turbo-charged: Colebrook was driving a £157,000 Audi R8 sports car like this one when he was stopped by police on the final leg of the 2012 DodgeBall Winter Rally . He said the process of returning the car could take years. After being stopped by police, . Colebrook joked on Twitter: ‘Being delivered to the #DodgeballRally . finish line by police car is pretty badass. Having to fly home is . not...’ The £5million . convoy of supercars, including a McLaren MP4-12C, a Rolls Royce Phantom . and a Ferrari 430 Spider, set off from the Mayfair Hotel in London on . March 1. The drivers in the invitation-only rally, which costs £2,250 per person, drove through France making stops in Paris and Burgundy before arriving in Verbier last Saturday, where the entrants then spent time on the slopes. The first stop of the rally was the Pontoise private airport just outside Paris where the runway was closed for the day so the participants could test their hypercars to the limit. Swiss police had been alerted about the rally and had set up multiple radars. Officers keep a close check on such rallies since they caught 20 motorcyclists in 2007 doing excessive speeds. Entrants in last year’s DodgeBall Rally included a Sheik driving a gold Bugatti Veryron and another driver in a Lamborghini Perfomante. Jonny Dodge, chief executive of GP Management, which organises the rally, said drivers are given a briefing by police before taking back and are told to ‘obey speed limits where they can’.",William Colebrook stopped by police in Audi R8 on final leg of elite tour .

Former New Zealand cricket captain Chris Cairns won £90,000 libel damages today over an accusation of match-fixing which he said turned his achievements to 'dust'. The 41-year-old, who notched up the rare double of 200 wickets and 3,000 runs in his 62 Tests, had sued Lalit Modi, ex-chairman of Twenty20 franchise the Indian Premier League (IPL), over an 'unequivocal allegation' on Twitter in January 2010. He was not at London’s High Court for the ruling by Mr Justice Bean, who heard the case without a jury. Scroll down for reaction outside court . Damages: Former New Zealand cricket captain Chris Cairns, left, won £90,000 libel damages against Lalit Modi, right, over an accusation of match fixing which he said turned his achievements to 'dust' The judge said that Modi had . 'singularly failed' to provide any reliable evidence that Cairns was . involved in match-fixing or spot-fixing, or even that there were strong . grounds for suspicion that he was. He said: 'It is obvious that an . allegation that a professional cricketer is a match-fixer goes to the . core attributes of his personality and, if true, entirely destroys his . reputation for integrity. 'The allegation is not as serious as . one of involvement in terrorism or sexual offences (to take two examples . from recent cases). But it is otherwise as serious an allegation as . anyone could make against a professional sportsman.' The judge heard that Modi’s tweet was picked up by cricket website Cricinfo. When Cairns complained, Cricinfo . withdrew its report, paid damages and apologised - but Modi declined to . apologise and pleaded justification, maintaining that the charge was . true. Cricket star: Chris Cairns of New Zealand in action during the Twenty20 International match between New Zealand and the West Indies in 2006 . Cairns’s case was that it was 'wholly . untrue' and a very grave libel which could destroy all he had achieved . over a distinguished 20-year career. In evidence, he said: 'The defendant’s allegations have also had a profound effect on my personal and private life. Cricket star: Chris Cairns hits 84 runs against England at Lords and sets a world record for sixes in test match cricket in 2004 . 'It put a strain on my marriage. It hurts that my wife may think that I am not the man she thought I was. 'It hurts me too that friends, many of . whom are former cricketing foes, will question my integrity as a man . and a sportsman and that all I achieved in the great game of cricket is . dust.' In 2007 and 2008, Cairns captained the . Chandigarh Lions in three competitions in the Indian Cricket League . (ICL), which flourished briefly before the ascendancy of the IPL. The allegation made by Modi related . to the second and third of these competitions, between March and April . 2008 and October and November that year. Later, Cairns said in a statement: . 'Today’s verdict lifts a dark cloud that has been over me for the past . two years. I feel mixed emotions. 'Firstly, sadness that I should ever . have had to put myself, my friends and my family through this because of . one man’s misdirected allegations. 'But I also feel great joy because my . past career has come through unscathed and remains intact and because I . had the courage to stand up in the highest court to defend my name.' He added: 'Lastly, I feel great relief that I am able to walk into any cricket ground in the world with my head held high.' The judge granted Modi permission to . appeal over the amount of damages but refused permission on the question . of liability, although Modi’s lawyers are set to pursue that . application with the Court of Appeal direct. He also ordered Modi to pay £400,000 on account of costs to Cairns’ solicitors within 28 days.","Chris Cairns said the accusation turned his achievements to 'dust' and put strain on his marriage .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:40 EST, 18 February 2012 . A Kentucky woman has pleaded guilty to killing an expectant mother and ripping her unborn baby . from the womb. Kathy . Coy of Morgantown entered the plea on grounds of mental illness on Friday morning at Warren Circuit Court. Family and . friends of the victim, 21-year-old Jamie Stice, appeared in court wearing pink . ribbons in support of the mother-to-be who was left for dead by the side of a road last April. Ms Stice's baby boy, Isaiah, survived the attack although he was born five weeks premature. He's now learning to walk, beginning to talk and bears a bittersweet resemblance to the slain woman. Guilty: Kathy Michelle Coy, seen here last April, pleaded guilty while mentally ill Friday to murdering Jamie Stice in a horrific plot to cut out her unborn baby from her body to claim as her own . Prosecutors say Miss Stice was shocked with a stun gun before having her wrists and throat cut. Coy faces life in prison without parole at her sentencing on March 1st. Before Friday's hearing, the boy's grandmother proudly showed off a photo of her chubby, smiling grandson on top of his father's shoulders. The pictures were the first released of the child who can now say 'mama', causing anguish to the Stice family. 'He looks a whole lot like Jamie when she was a baby,' Mrs Stice said. Growing up: Jamie Stice's mother posted this photo to a Facebook memorial showing her daughter, seen as an angel, with her baby Isaiah who is now a year old . Touching: Isaiah is seen visiting his mother's grave with his father James Reynolds who he now lives with . Remembered: Stice's baby was five weeks premature . Coy, who had shown little emotion in previous hearings, cried and shook her head on Friday as a prosecutor read the evidence against her. Her slight, high-pitched voice shook with emotion as she entered her plea to murder, capital kidnapping and kidnapping. She wore an orange jail jumpsuit and leg irons. 'The brutality of it is like nothing any of us have ever seen,' Warren County Commonwealth's Attorney Chris Cohron said. Mr Cohron said he would have sought the death penalty if Coy had been convicted at trial. Police had said Coy and Ms Stice were Facebook friends. The victim's mutilated body was found off a dirt road in southern Kentucky on April 14, a day after she had been seen leaving her home with Coy. Police arrested Coy at a local hospital after she arrived with the infant but showed no signs of having given birth. Psychologist Eric Drogin testified . briefly before the plea was entered. Mr Drogin said he met with the . 33-year-old Coy as recently as this week and that she suffers from a . mental illness. During a . hearing in April, Kentucky State Police detective Chad Winn testified . that Coy had lured the expectant mother out of her home by telling her they were going . shopping for baby supplies. After . killing Stice and stealing the baby boy, Coy drove to the home of a . friend and said she had given birth to the baby, Mr Winn said. The . friend told troopers that Coy was in a car, wearing no pants and . sitting on the placenta while holding the baby, who had grass on him. Left for dead: Jamie Stice, 21, was eight months . pregnant when she was attacked and her mutilated body was found in woodland.  James Reynolds, right, and Stice were no longer together when she was murdered . Growing up: The victim's brother said his nephew, pictured here with father James, . will grow up knowing about his mother and her hopes for him. She wrote . letters to her son during her pregnancy that Isaiah will be given . The friend called for an ambulance . after helping to clean the baby and taking a picture of the newborn. At . the hospital on April 13, Coy brought in a uterus, ovaries and placenta . with umbilical cord still attached, along with the baby, Mr Winn said. Coy initially insisted she gave birth to the boy, then told police she bought the baby for $550, Mr Winn said. Police searched Coy's home and . computer, finding links to two pregnant women on her Facebook page. Investigators found one of the women unharmed, but couldn't find Stice. Heartbreak: Jamie's tearful sister Angie, left, and mother Jeannie, right, being hugged by their ttorney, are pictured at court on Friday. They were among the 35 supporters who attended wearing pink ribbons . Police would later find a stun gun and two knives believed to be used in the attack. 'I then asked Ms Coy if that baby was Jamie Stice's,' Mr Winn testified. 'She answered ""I don't know,"" I was alarmed by this.' Coy was arrested shortly after she arrived at a friend's home with the baby still attached to the placenta and uterus . Coy eventually led detectives to a wooded area off a dirt road, where the victim's remains were located. Jamie Stice's body was found face down on the ground, disembowelled with her hands tied behind her back the next day. Her family ran from the courtroom when this part of the detective's testimony was read out last April. Mr Winn told reporters on Friday that Coy had faked pregnancies and was obsessed with the thought of having a baby. Coy has two children of her own but they didn't live with her, Mr Winn said. In . further testimony heard last spring, the detective said that Coy had asked her . teenage son to help her commit murder but when he refused she said she . was just joking. She had told people she was pregnant and had been hatching a plan for months, it was alleged. She even stole a sonogram photo to help back her claim. ‘She was desperate to prove to everybody that she was pregnant, and I . guess nobody believed her,’ said Ms Stice's friend, Ashley Reeder. Miss Stice had posted this photo of her bump on her Facebook page, with the caption 'Mommy's Baby Boy' ‘So I think she did this to show everybody that she was going to have the baby when it really wasn't her baby,’ she told NBC. Her neighbours in Bowling Green were all taken in by Coy’s baby scam. ‘She has been telling everyone that she was pregnant and we had no reason not to believe otherwise,’ said Darla Mueller. 'The miracle in the whole thing is that the baby made it,' Winn said of Jamie Stice's baby. Jamie Stice's 29-year-old brother Eric marvels at how his nephew has overcome his violent entry into the world. 'He's a miracle,' he said after the hearing. 'He's never had a doctor visit where he weighed in too light.' Mentally ill: The killer was previously married to Shannon Coy, pictured. She was already a mother of two when she killed Ms Stice, having a daughter and a son from previous relationships . At home, Jeannie Stice . memorialises her daughter with a wall of photos that recount happy . times. There are photos of her pregnant daughter and ultrasound pictures . of Isaiah. Jeannie and Eric Stice were among 35 . relatives and friends of Jamie Stice who came to Warren County Circuit . Court to witness Coy's plea. They wore pink ribbons. 'There's no justice that can be . served,' Eric Stice said afterward, calling his sister's killer a . monster. 'The worst possible thing that they could do to her would not . suffice the actions she committed.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:08 EST, 9 March 2012 . The mother of young children found living in a dilapidated bus has spoken out from prison saying the vehicle was in good shape and did not smell when she left. The siblings, a 5-year-old boy and 11-year-old girl, were found living alone in squalid conditions at the end of a muddy, one-lane road. But the children's parents, currently in . prison for hurricane-related fraud, insist they take good care of their . offspring, who have now been placed in emergency state care. Sherrie Shorten said the bus was supposed to be only a temporary home while they built their house on the wooded lot they bought in Splendora, Texas in 2009. 'We moved from an apartment into the bus to conserve funds, but then we were arrested,' Shorten told Chron.com. 'But there was no smell when we lived there.' Scroll down for video . Concerned citizen: Vanessa Picazo is the postal worker who saw the children and alerted the authorities . Makeshift: A sheriff's deputy inspects the bus where two children- a girl age 11 and boy age 5- were found living alone . Speaking from the federal prison in Lake Charles, Louisiana Shorten said she has daily telephone . conversations with her children and 60-year-old aunt, Hazel . Burts, who stays with the children at night. No one indicated anything . was wrong, she said. 'We were trying to keep them in their . normal routine, around the toys, clothes and home that they knew,' the . mother said. 'When we left, that bus was clean and did not reek of . anything.' The postal worker who discovered the children living alone on Wednesday described the squalid scene she found there. 'The little girl's hair was just . matted, like a stray dog's,' Vanessa Picazo said after alerting . authorities to the children's appalling living conditions. The father, known as Mark Shorten but who also goes by the name of Alan Parsons, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for conspiracy charges in January. Mark Shorten, 51, said he never . intended for the bus to be a permanent home. He said the family had . planned to build a house at the site, which was now strewn with reeking . trash. 'The house is normally clean. If me . or my wife were there, it would not be in that shape, I assure you,' Mark Shorten said. 'Our house would be completed or almost completed.' Both children told authorities they were being 'home-schooled.' Shorten . said her youngest knew his numbers and letters but was not supposed to . enter kindergarten until next year, and that she had continued teaching . her daughter by mail from her jail cell. 'Every week I would mail her a new set of lessons and return the graded . ones,' she said. 'We'd talk on the phone when she had questions. Last . week she was having trouble understanding exponents.' Randal McCann, a Louisiana attorney . who represented the children's mother prior to her imprisonment, said an . aunt had been taking care of the children since the case against the . parents was launched more than a year ago. 'It was believed by everybody . involved in this case that [the aunt] was properly tending to those . children. What I saw in the newspaper this morning was shocking,' Mr . McCann said. Upkeep: A woman, who is thought to be the children's great aunt, said that she works during the day but then spends the night with them and brings them food . Survivors: The two children, who have not been identified, are now in the care of Texas Child Protective Services . Mr McCann said the aunt would often contact him but only to discuss the criminal case and not the children. 'But there was no indication that the living conditions were as bad as those photographs,' the lawyer said. It was not clear how long the children had been living in the bus and whether the aunt lived with them or simply made visits. A spokesman for Child Protective . Services said authorities were less concerned about the bus itself than . with children's overall well-being. 'It's not the bus. It's the condition . and supervision issues,' spokesman Gwen Carter said, explaining that . the agency understands that poor families often must resort to dire . living arrangements. Surviving: Neither the 11-year-old girl nor her 5-year-old brother told authorities that they had been living on their own in the filthy bus since their parents went to federal prison earlier this year . On their own: The children were supposedly fending for themselves during the day and did not go to school but they claimed to be home schooled in the bus . Shorten and his wife, Sherrie, were . convicted of embezzling money from victims of Hurricane Ike, which . struck in 2008. The mother was arrested in December 2010, the father in . March 2011. In a phone interview with the . Associated Press from an Oklahoma City federal prison, Mark Shorten said . he had not slept since his children were taken Wednesday. He said an aunt who was asked to . watch the kids couldn't keep up, and he blamed the garbage blanketing . his property on neighbours dumping their trash there. Sherrie Shorten is scheduled to be released next month and says she plans to fight to regain her children. 'I want my kids back. I am being released April 5th and was looking forward to being reunited and making a fresh start,' she said. Investigating: An unidentified woman examines the bus on Thursday, the day after authorities found the scene . Awful amenities: The bus had an air conditioning unit in one window and working electricity throughout . The children slept in bed bunks that were installed in the bus, and the windows were covered . On Thursday the bus appeared to have electricity, and outside there was a small propane tank and homemade grill. The Shortens said the bus also has . hot and cold running water, including a shower and flush toilets, as . well as heat and closets. Ms Picazo said her latest visit to . the bus was not the first time she was worried about the children. Once . when she needed a signature for a package, the 11-year-old girl . volunteered. But when Ms Picazo handed her the signature slip, the girl . confessed she didn't know how to sign her name. That was a 'red flag that she wasn't being schooled. But she was a bright child,' Ms Picazo said. Mark Shorten said his children were . being home schooled through a Texas Tech University program. He said his . daughter was highly intelligent and 'can even do tax returns.' He said the family was originally . from Louisiana but that the hurricane left their home under more than . 8ft of water. They brought the bus to Texas and only planned to live in . it 'maybe nine months' while he built a new home on the property. Discovered: Though the bus is on private property, the children were found by a postal worker who saw them running around the grounds looking unkempt and dirty . Rough childhood: The bikes and scattered toys are the few reminders of the true age of the children who were fending for themselves in the abandoned bus . Neighbours told the Houston Chronicle . that the children typically looked unkempt and could often be spotted . running around at night. 'They always had dirty clothes on [and] no shoes, even in the winter,' said Gayla Payne. A woman on the property told welfare . agents that she worked 12-hour shifts Monday through Friday but that she . stayed with the children at night. 'The aunt said that she does provide . meals for them during the day,' Montgomery County Constable Rowdy Hayden . told Houston television station KTRK. Looking around the bus, 'we didn't . see a lot of food readily available,' Mr Hayden said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:58 EST, 8 March 2012 . The wife of a man who died in the Caribbean last year after being thrown from a speeding power boat taken out by Stew Leonard Sr., is suing the grocery chain tycoon and his son. Barbara Speranza is seeking 'millions of dollars' for the death of her 73-year-old husband Robert, according to the wrongful death lawsuit filed in Bridgeport, Connecticut. It claims Leonard, who founded the Connecticut-based Stew Leonard's stores, and his son Thomas were operating the $4.6 million boat at 'high speed' in rough waters despite weather warnings. Lawsuit: Barbara Speranza, left, has filed a lawsuit over the death of her husband Robert, right, who died after suffering brain, head and spinal damage before being thrown overboard a boat in the Caribbean . Their 'negligent and reckless' driving meant Speranza was 'violently tossed . about inside the boat' injuring his head and spine and throwing him overboard, the suit alleges, the Hartford Courant reported. Stew Leonard Jr., who had been friends with Speranza for 40 years, had previously said that a 12 to 15 foot 'rogue . wave' had hit the 70-foot powerboat, sweeping Speranza . overboard. But Mrs Speranza's lawyer Joel T. Faxon said Leonard had designed the boat, the Stew's Special, to reach 90 mph and it did not move vertically through the water at top speeds as speedboats should. The suit alleges that Stew Leonard decided to take the boat from St. Maarten, where Mr Speranza and his wife owned a resort, to St. Thomas despite a small craft advisory warning of a hurricane. Accused: She claims his death was caused by the reckless driving of Stew . Leonard Sr (third from left) and his son Thomas (second from . right). Leonard Sr founded grocery store chain Stew Leonard's in 1969 . 'Responsible': Thomas, left, and Stew, right, allegedly decided to take the boat on a 300 mile trip between two Caribbean Islands despite a small craft advisory warning about an approaching hurricane . 'First of all, he shouldn't be out there because conditions are so bad. Second, he shouldn't be out there on a 300-mile trip under those conditions,' Faxon told The Daily Weston. He added: 'The Leonard defendants are . responsible for Mr. Speranza's death. This lawsuit, combined with the . inquest in Tortola, will answer the many questions that have been raised . by Bob's death at sea. 'We will seek punitive damages from . the Leonard defendants to punish them for this senseless tragedy.' Mrs Speranza is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the death of her husband, but Faxon would not specify the amount. Fast: The $4.6 million 70-ft long power boat, Stew's Special, is designed to travel up to 90 mph . High life: Stew Leonard Sr, pictured aboard the boat with Sir Richard Branson, is being sued for 'millions' 'It will be several million dollars,' he told the Hartford Courant. 'Obviously he's a very wealthy man, and when . the jury makes a decision on punitive damages they have to decide what . amount constitutes a punishment for that person. The wealth of a . defendant is a factor.' Stew Leonard Sr. opened his first grocery store in Norwalk, Connecticut in 1969. It came complete with an animal farm and initially just focused on dairy. Since, the brand has expanded to four stores in Connecticut and Yonkers, New York, as well as a spin-off store, Tom Leonard's in Virginia. The chain is known for their meandering paths around stores, as well as mechanic, singing animals placed by entrances and aisles. There are also games zones and petting zoos to entertain children while their parents shop. Annual sales are around $300 million and the company employs nearly 2,000 employees. But it was scandal hit in 1993, when Stew Leonard Sr. was convicted of committing tax fraud. He diverted more than $17 million in cash register receipts over a ten-year period, avoiding nearly $7 million in tax. He was sentenced to 52-months in jail. Carpe Diem Three LLC, which owns the boat, is also named in the lawsuit. Stew Leonard Sr. is a member of the company, Faxon said . The three men were on board with the vessel's captain, Martijn Haasdit, when they got into trouble, previous reports claimed. Stew Leonard Sr had recounted to the Westport News: 'The . wave came crashing through the boat and smashed the glass of the . 10-foot-wide windshield, which is normally bulletproof. 'My son was also swept down to the back of the boat, but he was able to grab onto a railing. 'Immediately we turned the boat around to look for Bob where we saw white cushions floating in the water. 'We called in a 'mayday,' got him on . board, and proceeded to do CPR on him for about 30 minutes, which was . the time it took to get the boat to Tortola. 'We all worked on him, trying everything we could to resuscitate him, but to no avail.' Before his death, the couple, who had . been married for 53 years, ran the Ocean Club, a resort on the . Caribbean island of St. Maarten. They moved to the island from New Haven, Connecticut. Mr Seranza had previously worked as an engineer for NASA. But now Mrs Speranza will be forced to close the resort, Faxon claimed. Sued: Tom Leonard, who has been named in the lawsuit along with his father and the boat's owner, opened a spinoff of the store, Tom Leonard's Farmer's Market (pictured), in Virginia in 2004 . Family business: It is not the first timeStew Leonard Sr (third from left, with his family), has a run in with the law. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to a $6.7 million tax fraud and was sentenced to 52 months in jail . 'I cannot run the business, I have to sell it,' he quotes her as saying. 'My life is completely turned upside down, all as consequence of a reckless decision made by Stew Leonard.' It is not the first time Leonard Sr. has been in trouble with the law; in 1993, Leonard Sr. pleaded guilty to the largest tax fraud in state history and received a 52-month prison term. It came after he oversaw the use of a computer software program to skim $17.1 million off the books to avoid paying $6.7 million in taxes. A spokeswoman at Stew Leonard's told the Courant the company had no comment.

The rogue American soldier who shot dead 16 Afghan civilians in their beds may havelaunched the killing spree for revenge after seeing his friend’s leg blown off by a bomb the day before the massacre. The highly decorated veteran was also traumatised by two battle wounds, suffering brain damage and losing part of his foot, his lawyer said yesterday. Tears of grief: An Afghan youth mourns for his relatives, who were allegedly killed by the U.S. service member over the weekend . Burning anger: Afghan students protested this week and burnt an effigy of President Obama . A high-ranking U.S. official also claimed the gunman was drunk when he embarked on the rampage. ‘When it all comes out it will be a combination of stress, alcohol and marital issues – he just snapped,’ the aide said. The revelations came amid growing anger in Afghanistanover the decision to fly the soldier out of the country. He was initially taken to Kuwait but is expected to be flown back to the U.S. because the Kuwaitis don’t want to get caught up in the row. Afghans, furious over the attack on defenceless villagers – which left nine children among the dead– fear they won’t get justice if the soldier is tried in America. Lawyer: The shooter is being represented by John Henry Browne, pictured, an attorney who has defended notorious serial killer Ted Bundy and the 'Barefoot Bandit . Horrific: The bodies of an elderly Afghan man and a child killed in the Alkozai village of Panjwayi district are shown wrapped in blankets . Aftermath: Families gather in the Panjwayi district on Sunday, hours after the rogue U.S. soldier opened fire on innocents in three houses, killing 16 people, including nine children . Disbelief: Two grief-stricken Afghan men look into the van where the body of a badly burned child is wrapped in a blue blanket following the shooting last weekend . The 38-year-old father of two from Seattle has not been named by the military because of concernthat his young family could be targeted. He has two children, aged three and four. His lawyer, John Browne, said the family provided him with details of the injury to his friend. He said: ‘His leg was blown off, and my client was standing next to him.’ During tours in Iraq, the suspect suffered a head injury in a car accident caused by a roadsidebomb and a battle-related injury that resulted in surgery to remove part of his foot. High alert: American soldiers keep watch at the entrance of a military base near Alkozai village following the shooting of Afghan civilians, after which the Afghan Taliban vowed revenge . Mr Browne has spoken briefly by phone with the soldier, who was ‘stunned and distant’. His family were ‘totally shocked’, he said. ‘He’s never said anything antagonistic about Muslims. He’s in general very mild-mannered.’ The family were unaware of any drink problem, and he described the couple’s marriage as ‘fabulous’. Scene of the crime: Afghan men investigate at the site of an shooting incident in Kandahar province .

"Nixon calls his future wife Patricia Ryan 'dearest heart' and daydreams about their future together . Letters go on display this Friday at California museum to celebrate 100th birthday of Nixon's wife . By . Rachel Rickard Straus . PUBLISHED: . 06:54 EST, 12 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:09 EST, 12 March 2012 . Richard Nixon is remembered for many things – but very rarely for being a softy. However a series of love letters penned to his future wife long before his rise to power and fall from grace, reveal that at one time he was just another man in love. Decades before he became known to some as ‘Tricky Dick’, it was Nixon making up the nicknames – sweet ones to his future bride in gushy love notes that reveal a surprisingly soft and romantic side of the man taken down by Watergate. Young love: Then attorney Richard Nixon and his bride pose with their newly acquired marriage license in in front of a fireplace at the Mission Inn. They wed in the inn's wedding chapel on June 12, 1940 . Love token: This delicately written letter from Pat Nixon to her husband is part of the display . ‘Dearest heart’, he addresses her, while recalling their first meeting in flowery prose and daydreaming about their future together. During their two-year courtship Nixon and his wife Patricia Ryan exchanged dozens of letters, six of which will be unveiled Friday at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, California, as part of an exhibit celebrating the 100th birthday of the woman Nixon playfully called his ‘Irish gypsy.’ ‘Every day and every night I want to see you and be with you. Yet I have no feeling of selfish ownership or jealousy,’ Nixon writes in one undated letter. ‘Let's go for a long ride Sunday; let's go to the mountains weekends; let's read books in front of fires; most of all, let's really grow together and find the happiness we know is ours.’ Eighteen years after his death, the correspondence offers a tiny window into a fiercely private side of Nixon that almost no one ever saw. ‘These letters are fabulous,’ said supervisory museum curator Olivia Anastasiadis. ‘It's a totally different person from the Watergate tapes that people know. President Nixon started out as an idealistic young man ready to conquer the world and with Pat Ryan he knew he could do it. There's a lot of hope, there's a lot of tenderness and it's very poetic. United: Richard Nixon and his wife Pat pose for photos while campaigning at the Rockefeller Center in New York in 1960 . Tender: The highly personal letters reveal a totally different side to Nixon . Richard Nixon was secretly seeing a psychiatrist during the height of his political career, a new book has claimed. The former US president began seeing Dr Arnold Hutschnecker in 1952 with a string of complaints he thought were all in his mind, like back and neck pain and insomnia. ‘The Gumshoe and the Shrink’ claims that Nixon continued seeing the doctor for at least a decade including during the fateful 1960 election which he lost to John F Kennedy. Should the disclosures have been made public at the time, it is questionable whether voters would have allowed such an unstable man to become president. Author David Robb also reveals that in a foreshadowing of Watergate Nixon once hired a private eye to look into Kennedy’s health. According to the book, in 1960 Nixon’s team got into offices belonging to two doctors treating Kennedy looking for dirt that he was actually secretly ill. When Kennedy found this out his father bizarrely asked his friend Frank Sinatra to find the best investigator around so they could do their own digging. ‘He loved her, he was absolutely enthralled by her and that's all he thought about.’ The letters stand in stark contrast to the grim-faced leader forced to resign in 1974, disgraced. Instead, Nixon comes across as an ardent and persistent suitor in the letters, which date from 1938 to just before the couple's marriage in June 1940. The two met while auditioning for ‘The Dark Tower’ in the Southern California town of Whittier and dated for two years until Nixon proposed on the south Orange County cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. He later delivered her engagement ring in a small basket overflowing with mayflowers. The romantic touch and chivalry that Nixon brought to his seaside proposal comes through in the letters as well. In two of the handwritten notes, . Nixon — raised a Quaker — uses ‘thee’ instead of ‘you’ to refer to his . future bride, a pronoun that signals a special closeness in the Quaker . tradition. He also writes about himself in the third person, referring . to himself as a ‘prosaic person’ whose heart was nonetheless ‘filled . with that grand poetic music’ upon knowing her. ‘Somehow . on Tuesday there was something electric in the usually almost stifling . air in Whittier. And now I know. An Irish gypsy who radiates all that is . happy and beautiful was there,’ he wrote in one letter. ‘She left . behind her a note addressed to a struggling barrister who looks from a . window and dreams. And in that note he found sunshine and flowers, and a . great spirit which only great ladies can inspire. Someday let me see . you again? In September? Maybe?’ A . much more practical - and somewhat less impulsive — Pat Ryan replies in . one short note: ‘In case I don't see you before why don't you come . early Wednesday - and I'll see if I can burn a hamburger for you.’ The . object of Nixon's affection was slower to come around, but eventually . was just as smitten with Nixon as he was with her, said Ed Nixon, . Nixon's youngest brother. Exhibition: Six love letters go on display on Friday at the Richard Nixon Presidential . ‘She was quite an independent young lady and she was very cautious about anyone she met and if they couldn't smile, she wouldn't want to do too much unless she could make them smile. That captured Dick's imagination,’ the younger Nixon said. ‘She was challenging. She challenged me and I think she challenged Dick.’ Nixon's presidency began to unravel in 1972 when burglars who were later tied to his re-election committee broke into the Democratic headquarters to get dirt on his political adversaries. Nixon denied knowing about plans for the break-in beforehand, but an 18 1/2 minute gap in a recording of a post-Watergate White House meeting led many to suspect a cover-up. Secret shrink: A new book details the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon against John F Kennedy and how Nixon was secretly seeing a psychiatrist . Faced with impeachment and a possible criminal indictment, Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974 and retreated to his native California. The following month he was granted a pardon by President Gerald Ford. Pat Nixon never doubted her husband and stood by him until she died in 1993, a day after their 53rd wedding anniversary, said Robert Bostock, a consultant to the Richard Nixon Foundation, which is co-sponsoring the exhibit, and a former aide to Nixon after he left the White House. Her loyalty and spirit was a . testament to their love and part of what bound them together from the . earliest days of their courtship in Whittier, when he was a young . attorney and she a high school stenography teacher fresh out of college. ‘She . was with him the whole way; she never lost faith in him. Her feeling . was that it was the country's loss when he had to resign, that he had . accomplished so much good and had so much more good to accomplish,’ Mr . Bostock said. ‘Her favourite saying was, 'Onward and upward.' She spent . no time looking back. She was always looking forward.’ Revelations: British journalist David Frost (left) interviewed Richard Nixon in a series in 1977 that ended in one of 20th century television's most dramatic confessions .","Nixon calls his future wife Patricia Ryan 'dearest heart' and daydreams about their future together .

Gareth Warden, prosecuting, told the court how a man called police when a woman who appeared drunk asked him to start her broken-down car in Plymouth, Devon at about 2.45pm on Monday. He said officers arrived and smelt alcohol in the Honda. They then discovered the bottle of gin, a bottle of tonic water and a glass containing slices of lemon in her car. Plymouth Magistrates' Court: The sentence was adjourned for Hawke to be assessed for an order to treat her habit but she was handed an interim driving ban. She was released on unconditional bail until April 30 and refused to comment upon leaving court . Mr Warden said she failed a breath test at the side of the road and failed on four occasions to provide a sample back at the police station. Two samples are needed in a police station to support a drink-driving conviction. Bill LaHive, mitigating, said Hawke had herself described the incident as 'crazy.' He said she was very upset at the death of an uncle to whom she was close in what he said were 'tragic circumstances.' Mr LaHive said she started drinking in the morning while sorting out his belongings and then ran out of petrol on her way to the supermarket, which caused her car to stop. He added that she had sought help for her drink problem and was making progress but the bereavement had brought 'matters to a head.' Hawke had been able to combine her work at Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust with binge drinking, he said. Probation officer Charlie Casey said Hawke would drink for a couple of days at a time, but not while she was at work. Magistrates adjourned sentence for her to be assessed for an order to treat her habit but she was handed an interim driving ban. She was released on unconditional bail until April 30 and refused to comment upon leaving court.","Janice Hawke failed a breath test at the side of the road and later refused a blood alcohol test at police station .

Former Liberian President Charles Taylor begged for leniency ahead of his sentencing for a catalogue of brutal war crimes saying he has sympathy for Sierra Leone’s civil war. Taylor was found guilty of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, and conscripting child soldiers, during a landmark ruling by judges at the U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone in April. He asked judges at The Hague to render their sentence against him in a spirit of ‘reconciliation, not retribution’. However, he stopped short of admitting any wrongdoing, apologizing for his actions, or expressing remorse. Prosecutors said there was no reason for leniency, given the extreme nature of the crimes, Taylor's ‘greed’ and misuse of his position of power. ‘The purposely cruel and savage crimes committed included public executions and amputations of civilians, the display of decapitated heads at checkpoints, the killing and public disembowelment of a civilian whose intestines were then stretched across the road to make a check point, public rapes of women and girls, and people burned alive in their homes,’ wrote prosecutor Brenda Hollis in a pre-hearing brief. The court found his aid was essential in helping rebels in Sierra Leone continue their bloody rampage during the West African nation's decade-long civil war, which ended in 2002 with more than 50,000 dead. It was the first time a former head of state had been convicted of war crimes since the aftermath of World War II. Attacked: Victims of the brutal crimes committed during the Sierra Leone civil war nurse their wounds . Crimes: Taylor was found guilty of conscripting child soldiers during the decade-long Sierra Leone civil war . Child soldier: Youngsters were forced into the army during Liberia's violent civil war, where women were held as sex slaves and civilians had limbs hacked off with machetes . Innocent victim: A young girl, who has had both of her hands amputated, rests at a camp for amputees and wounded from Sierra Leone's civil war . Taylor is due to be sentenced on May 30, with prosecutors demanding an 80-year prison term, and defence lawyers arguing he should at least be given a sentence that leaves him some hope for life after release. ‘I express my sadness and deepest sympathy for the atrocities and crimes that were suffered by individuals and families in Sierra Leone,’ Taylor said. He insisted his actions had actually been done to help stabilize the region and claimed he never knowingly assisted in the commission of crimes. ‘What I did...was done with honour,’ he said. ‘I was convinced that unless there was peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia would not be able to move forward.’ Chaos: The decade-long civil war saw tens of thousands of people killed and many more horrifically mutilated during the bloody conflict . Bloody: A soldier loyal to Taylor keeps watch on the streets of Monrovia during fighting . Judges found Taylor helped the rebels obtain weapons in full knowledge they would likely be used to commit terrible crimes, in exchange for payments of ‘blood diamonds’ often obtained by slave labor. Defence attorney Courtenay Griffiths argued for a sentence that reflects Taylor's indirect role: he was found guilty only of aiding the rebels, not leading them, as prosecutors originally charged. He said Taylor's conviction has been ‘trumpeted...as sending an unequivocal message to world leaders that holding office confers no immunity’ from war crimes prosecution. 'But the reality is that while many Western countries have funded militias that have committed atrocities, no Western leader has ever been indicted by a war crimes tribunal, he said. Real prize: Miners from Sierra Leone wash gravel in large sieves looking for rough diamonds . Country's gems: Diamonds from Koidu town in eastern Sierra Leone, which sparked horrifying civil war that would later inspire the film Blood Diamond . The lesson is ‘if you are a small, weak nation, you may be subject to the full force of international law, whereas if you run a powerful nation you have nothing to fear,’ Griffiths said. Taylor added that once Britain and the U.S. decided they wanted him out of power, his conviction was a foregone conclusion. ‘The conspiracy was born, all systems put into motion, and here I stand today,’ he said. ‘I never stood a chance.’ Leaked Wikileaks diplomatic cables admitted into evidence appeared to show the U.S. government hoped Taylor would never return to power, but the cables did not prevent his conviction. Judgement day: Judges Teresa Doherty, Richard Lussick and Julia Sebutinde, rear row from left to right, will sentence Charles Taylor on May 30 . Griffiths said the 80 year sentencing demand is ‘manifestly disproportionate and excessive’ for Taylor, who is 64. In court, Hollis scoffed at that. She said Taylor's involvement in the crimes was ‘more pervasive than that of the most senior leaders’ of the Sierra Leone rebels who have already been sentenced. The longest sentence so far, 52 years, was handed down to rebel leader Issa Sesay, who testified on Taylor's behalf in 2010. Taylor fled into exile in Nigeria after being indicted by the court in 2003 and wasn't arrested for three years. While the Sierra Leone court is formally based in that country's capital, Taylor's trial is being staged in Leidschendam, a suburb of The Hague, Netherlands, for fear holding it in West Africa could destabilize the region.","Former Liberian President Charles Taylor begs for leniency before sentencing at The Hague for war crimes .

A female lawyer who posted an erotic novel on the internet has won the go-ahead to sue a top City law firm for almost £22 million for alleged sexual harassment. Deidre Clark, 46, is demanding the huge damages after she was fired by Allen & Overy from her £126,000-a-year job at its Moscow office. Miss Clark, whose pen name is Deidre Dare, claims she suffered 'sexual persecution' by her 60-year-old married boss at the firm between July 2008 and her sacking in January 2009. East London employment tribunal last year refused to hear her £3.5 million claim for sex discrimination and unfair dismissal last year, saying it was outside its jurisdiction. But now US judge Marcy Friedman has ruled that Miss Clark should be allowed to take legal action in New York, where she currently lives. Her $35 million claim accuses Allen & Overy of sexual harassment, discrimination, wrongful termination of her employment, retaliation, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent retention and supervision of the lawyer who allegedly harassed her, defamation, and conspiracy. Allen & Overy once again tried to have Miss Clark’s case kicked out for lack of jurisdiction - but Judge Friedman ruled in her favour on seven out of eight counts. Miss Clark, who represented herself in court, said afterwards: 'I won against Allen & Overy! Isn’t it amazing? 'You can’t imagine how great it feels - pure joy, really. And it’s not just a win. I devastated them.' Since leaving the firm, Miss Clark has written a newspaper column telling of her love of sado-masochist sex and bondage - and claimed it is 'natural' for men to rape and beat women. According to the preliminary ruling at New York’s Supreme Court, Miss Clark alleges that on July 19, 2008 she 'engaged in sexual activity with Tony Humphrey, the partner supervising her work in Moscow, while she was intoxicated at a party in the home of a colleague'. He allegedly then 'made inappropriate comments, sought to engage Miss Clark in sexual conversations and ceased to give her work assignments'. In legal papers put before both the English and American courts, Miss Clark alleges that her sacking was purely down to him. She claims that he became 'sexually obsessed' with her after their steamy clinch - that did not involve actual sex - in full view of colleagues at the party. She says he was then left 'infuriated' when he spotting her with a new, Russian boyfriend. She claims: 'When I rebuffed his further advances and took up with a much younger and Russian man, it infuriated him and made him crazy with jealousy and that that is why I was dismissed. 'I believe my dismissal was purely a matter of sexual persecution by my superior.' Miss Clark’s novel ‘Expat’, written as Deidre Dare, was seen as exposing the debauched sex and drugs lifestyle of highly-paid Westerners in Moscow. The heroine, Dasha, states: 'I drink too much. I do too many drugs. I f**k around. I waste days and time. I spend too much time at parties. There’s a shorter way of saying all that: ""I live in Moscow"".' Miss Clark was sacked by Allen & Overy in January 2009 and told it was because of the novel, racy poetry and revealing pictures of herself that she was posting on her website. Racy: Miss Clark posted a number of pictures of herself scantily attired on her website . But she claims that reason was just a pretext for her sacking; denies that the novel was about colleagues; and insists she had the right to publish a fictional story. Allen & Overy said when Miss Clark was fired that her novel was 'unacceptable and totally at odds with the standards of behaviour that we expect'. But she alleges: 'One of my potential clients said he often sees A&O people at whorehouses and throwing up in bars. 'He couldn’t understand how my little book could possibly bring the firm into disrepute.' In her subsequent newspaper column for the Moscow News called ‘sExpat’ she wrote: 'Men have been dragging women by the hair since caveman days. It’s in their nature to be violent. 'The human male has evolved to slap his slutty woman... if you’re hanging out with real men and you’re a little slutty, you’re going to get hit. Period.' Miss Clark described rape as 'simply part of human nature', adding: 'At any rate, it works out perfectly for me. When it goes to raping and pillaging, I say: Bring it on, baby!!!' In one article entitled ‘Come on, cavemen!’, Miss Clark said she 'gets off on being bound and whipped inside the bedroom'. She wrote: 'Anyone who has spent even five minutes in bed with me knows that I have a strong proclivity for S&M.' She went on to say that she has been slapped and thrown into walls by jealous Russian boyfriends and mocks Western women for ditching boyfriends and seeking restraining orders over domestic violence. She said: 'Russian men are MEN. Real men. And I rather like that.' Allen & Overy said: 'We have always been entirely satisfied that the termination of Ms Clark’s employment was justified and lawful. 'We remain committed to defending Ms Clark’s claim vigorously.'","Deirdre Clark was fired from her £126k-a-year job in Allen & Overy, Moscow .

A devoted wife is giving her husband the gift of life, after she was found to be a million to one match for a kidney transplant. Nina Woodburn of Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria, said she was ‘over the moon’ when doctors told her she could donate one of her own kidneys to her husband Darren who has been on kidney dialysis for several years after his original kidney transplant failed . Darren, 42, who first had his first kidney transplant . when he was 20 described Nina as the light at the end of his tunnel. He said: 'I’m one of the lucky ones, there are . people who have been going into . clinics for years with no light at the end of the tunnel. Devoted couple: Nina Woodburn will give husband Darren the gift of life, after she was found to be a million-to-one match for a kidney transplant . It has been a two-year struggle for . the couple, who have had to undergo a series of tests to triple-check . that they would be a safe match. Nina said it had been ‘really hard’ to watch her husband’s health deteriorate during that time. 'I just want to save his life, I want him back to what he was like when I married him,' said the 33-year-old. Finding a match was difficult for Darren because this will be his second kidney transplant. His first transplanted kidney lasted for two decades, but now Darren's health is deteriorating rapidly, with a . loss of energy and a daily restriction on what he can eat and drink. Gruelling: Darren Woodburn is one of 6,500 people who have to be attached to a kidney dialysis machine like this one every week as they desperately wait for a kidney transplant . While waiting for the transplant, Darren continues to undergo gruelling dialysis sessions which take a full day once a week. Nina says that before the weekly treatments his mood . and energy levels make it a struggle to even get out of bed. she said: 'Darren doesn’t want me to do it because he doesn’t want me to go through what he has but I just want to him back.' Now the couple are appealing for more people to join the organ donor register (ODR) in a bid to help the 6,500 people who are desperately waiting for a new kidney in the North West of England where last year only 19 transplants were completed. Helping others: Nina and Darren Woodburn hope that highlighting their story will encourage others to sign up to the organ donor register . 'I feel so lucky that I can do this for my husband,' said Nina. 'If I had 100 kidneys I would give each of them away. If people saw what living with the illness was like then I think everyone would join the register.' Darren is allowed just 900ml a day to drink and so gets very dehydrated. He has also developed a renal bone disorder which has meant he has had to have a hip replacement. The couple now hope they will be called to the Royal Manchester Infirmary for the surgery as early as May or June. When the operation is over Darren and Nina say they are really looking forward to a trip abroad, a luxury they have not been able to enjoy for years. Darren also said he was excited about eating a bowl of cereal with lots of milk. 'It’s the simple things you really miss,” he said. “It’s like putting your life on hold.' Fiona Biggins, live donor co-ordinator at the Royal Preston Hospital, said that in the last 12 months there had been a ‘plateau’ of people coming forward to join either the ODR or live transplant scheme in the North West. She added: “Even if people are not compatible with a person they want to help with there are other ways of donating.' Donors and recipients can be matched up with people all around the country.","Transplant will be end of two-year struggle for couple .

"By . Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 12:27 EST, 17 November 2011 . Georgina Edmonds, 77, was 'brutally murdered' inside her country cottage in Brambridge, Hampshire, by electrician Matthew Hamlen, 33, the prosecution allege . A man tortured a pensioner with a knife for her credit card pin number and then beat her to death with her own marble rolling pin, a court heard today. Grandmother Georgina Edmonds, 77, was 'brutally murdered' in January 2008 inside her country cottage in Brambridge, Hampshire, by electrician Matthew Hamlen, 33, the prosecution allege. A jury at Winchester Crown Court was told that Mrs Edmonds lived in the grounds of her son Harry's house and was independent, but suffered from osteoporosis and had had several hip replacements. She was discovered in a pool of blood in the kitchen by her son and two estate workers after the house was found in darkness. She had been unable to defend herself or activate a personal alarm, the court heard. Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, told the jury: 'The many knife wounds penetrated Georgina Edmonds's skin. Their pattern suggests they had been inflicted with some deliberation rather than a significant degree of force. 'Given the theft of her credit card and its unsuccessful use hours later, the inference is she was tortured in order to obtain her pin and then beaten to death.' Hamlen, from Eastleigh, Hampshire, denies murder. The court heard that the self-employed electrician admitted to police in June 2010 that he was a cocaine addict in the year of the murder and would spend up to £100 a week on the Class A drug. Mr Bowes said: 'He (Hamlen) said that in 2008 he was a very different person from who he was in June 2010. He had taken cocaine. It was possible that in January 2008 he was on cocaine. 'He agreed that he may have been spending £100 a week on cocaine but imagined he had paid for it by working.' Mr Bowes added that Hamlen confessed he had drug debts which he needed to pay back and may have been threatened with physical violence if he failed to find the cash. Police found he was nearly £6,000 in debt in January 2008. The court heard that it was Mrs Edmonds's son who found her body. He had gone to see his mother after he returned home from work on January 11. He noticed that all the lights were off, which was unusual and the door was locked which was also unusual, Mr Bowes said. 'The whole place seemed dark and still and he had a feeling that something was just not right,' he told the jury. The 77-year-old grandmother was discovered in the kitchen of her cottage, pictured, in a pool of blood . A police officer stands at the end of the lane where Mrs Edmonds lived . Mr Edmonds tried to phone his mother . but got no answer. He later returned to the house with the estate . workers and found the pensioner. 'Initially . he thought she had fallen. He then saw his mother lying flat on her . face, completely still, with a very significant pool of blood coming . from her head or face,' the barrister explained. 'He . saw that her trousers had been pulled down slightly and that on the . back of her head there was a significant pinkish dent, as if caused by . one huge hit or by several blows in the same place. 'It was obvious to him that she was dead and that she had been murdered.' Mr . Bowes told the jury that Mrs Edmonds had suffered knife wounds to her . neck, shoulder, abdomen and thighs and fractured ribs, and the . prosecution claim they were due to 'jabbing which was part of escalating . violence in order to get information out of her'. He said her credit card, mobile phone and handbag were stolen and that her alleged murderer, Hamlen, had attempted to use the card unsuccessfully in a nearby Tesco Express cash machine at 10.38pm that night and he was captured on CCTV disguised in a hooded fluorescent jacket. Mr Bowes also told the jury there was a 'forensic DNA link to Hamlen' from the rolling pin handle. Analysis of Hamlen's mobile phone also showed him in the vicinity of where Mrs Edmonds lived. Hamlen was first interviewed as a witness in August 2008 when he said he did not know the area around the cottage well and he was at work that day. When interviewed under caution in 2010, Hamlen said he could not remember his movements that day and he denied the murder, but he said to police he walked all around the area where the cottage was. He said he might have gone into the grounds of the cottage, which he knew, because he liked old houses and castles and he liked to have 'a nose'. But he could not be sure whether he was in the cottage on the day of the murder. The case, which is expected to last six weeks, was adjourned until tomorrow.","Georgina Edmonds, 77, was found in her kitchen in a  pool of blood .

"By . Paul Sims . UPDATED: . 20:45 EST, 8 November 2011 . Jon Venables (pictured aged ten) abducted, tortured and then murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993. He was jailed last year after he was caught with a stash of depraved images . Child killer Jon Venables is being kept in prison for his own safety – because he cannot be trusted with keeping a new identity secret. Venables and his friend Robert Thompson were ten when they were jailed for life after they abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993. When they were released in 2001  amid a public outcry, they were given new identities to protect them from vigilantes. But after Venables was jailed again last year, when he was caught with of stash of child pornography, it emerged the killer had already blown his own cover. Officials have now ruled out giving him a second false identity – which costs taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds – on the grounds he would not be able to keep his real past hidden, sources have told the Mail. The extraordinary development means that Venables will remain in prison for the foreseeable future for his own safety. Denise Fergus, James’s mother, said: ‘In his twisted mind he believes the name Jon Venables makes him some kind of celebrity and he cannot resist telling people who he really is. ‘It seems he gets some kind of perverse thrill from it, and it’s clear he has no remorse about murdering my son.’ A surveillance camera shows James holding the hand of Venables as he is taken from the Bootle Stand shopping mall on February 12, 1993 . Draconian legal anonymity orders ban any information being revealed about the identities or whereabouts of Venables and Thompson, who killed James after luring him away from his mother in a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside. During Venables’s child pornography trial last year, his barrister claimed the strain of living under an assumed name and constant threats to his life had led him into drink and drug addiction. He then apparently became paranoid that friends had discovered his true identity and he began telling them who he really was, before calling his probation officer to raise the alarm. Victim: Jamie Bulger, 2, left, was murdered after being led away from a shopping centre and right, his mother Denise Fergus, who said Venables 'cannot be trusted outside prison' Officials are now convinced that if released after completing his two-year sentence he would not be able to keep secret a second identity, leaving him a sitting duck. ‘If Venables were to be given a new identity the chances are that he would compromise it,’ said a source. ‘That puts him in danger of vigilante attacks. ‘It is safer for him if he remains in custody until he no longer poses a risk of revealing his true identity. Venables received a life sentence for the murder of James Bulger, so they can keep hold of him for as long as they want.’ The decision not to give Venables a new name comes despite a High Court ruling that he was in ‘clear and present danger’ of being killed should his true identity ever be revealed. Last night, prison sources confirmed there were ‘no current plans’ to create a new identity for the 29-year-old killer, who is still using the alias he was given in 2001. ‘It would be a pointless waste of money  giving him a new identity at the moment because he is unable to keep his real name a secret,’ said one source. ‘He remains at risk of revealing his true identity, and until that is resolved he won’t be given a new name or be released from prison.’ Harry Fletcher, of the National Association of Probation Officers, said: ‘Changing a criminal’s identity is an extremely expensive thing to do. The decision will not be taken if there is a risk the individual involved would fully disclose his identity to others. ‘For his own safety, to protect the individual from others, he would remain in confinement in prison.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment.","‘If Venables were to be given a new identity the chances are that he would compromise it.

Public trust in David Cameron and George Osborne to steer Britain through the economic crisis has plunged to a record low following last month’s botched Budget. A new ComRes poll has revealed that almost two thirds of British people do not trust the Chancellor to handle the  economy, while more than half have lost faith in the Prime Minister. The dire ratings, the worst since both men came to office in May 2010, follow the most turbulent period of Mr Cameron’s premiership. Pressure to perform: Two thirds of British people don't trust the Chancellor with the economy, while half have lost faith in the Prime Minister . Since the Budget the Prime Minister and Chancellor have faced a furious backlash over the so-called ‘Granny Tax’, the fuel crisis and plans to allow same-sex couples to marry. The latest poll ratings are likely to fuel growing discontent on the Tory backbenches, with increasing numbers of Conservative MPs accusing Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne of being out of touch with the party and its voters. The poll, conducted for ITV News, has found that 60 per cent of people do not trust the Chancellor with the economy – up from 52 per cent on last month. Meanwhile, the numbers saying that they would trust him have plunged to 21 per cent. The proportion who say they trust the Prime Minister has also hit a new low of 31 per cent, down from 36 per cent. The numbers who do not trust Mr Cameron have increased from 47 per cent last month to 53 per cent – equal to the Prime Minister’s worst previous rating. The March 21 Budget was supposed to cement the Government’s seven-year austerity plan and offer help for those on low incomes. But it triggered a furious backlash over plans to axe tax relief for the elderly and a tax rise on pasties. Sceptical: The poll finds that the proportion of people who say they trust David Cameron has fallen from 36 per cent to 31 per cent . The proportion who say they trust the Prime Minister has also hit a new low of 31 per cent, down from 36 per cent. Just days later, the Tories were hit by another scandal following an investigation by newspaper reporters who revealed that a Conservative treasurer offered access to the Prime Minister in return for a hefty donation to the party. Ministers were also fiercely criticised for triggering panic buying of fuel after they reacted to a potential strike by  petrol tanker drivers by urging motorists to keep their cars topped up and hoard petrol in cans at home. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s ratings are also worse, with just 15 per cent saying they have faith in him to run the economy. Labour does not appear to be benefiting, though. Leader Ed Miliband’s trust rating is up just two percentage points to 18 while Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is unchanged at 15 per cent.","Ratings worst since both men came to office in May 2010 .

Mr Roots, who shot to fame on TV's Dragons Den, met writer Anita Flowers when she paid him to do talks at the Performing Rights Society. At the time he was planning to launch the sauce, and was 'looking for' £5,000 to fund the project, it was said. In court: Levi Roots, left, is being sued by old friend, Tony Bailey, 52, right, who claims he stole his secret recipe and took it on Dragons Den in 2007 . She gave him the money and the sauce later went on to be a huge success - but he failed to pay her back, the court heard. The 53-year-old reggae singer and entrepreneur is being sued by old friend, Tony Bailey, 52, who claims Mr Roots stole his secret recipe and took it on Dragons Den in 2007. Mr Roots won a £50,000 investment from 'Dragons' Peter Jones and Richard Farleigh, and the famous franchise is now worth millions. He is also being sued by financial advisor Sylvester Williams, who claims he, Mr Bailey and Mr Roots had an agreement to go in to business together, when Mr Roots cut them out and went it alone by appearing on the show. The court heard how before he shot to fame on the hit BBC 2 show, Mr Roots is said to have borrowed cash from Welsh author Ms Flowers, who wrote Masking the Madness. Dragon: Mr Roots won a £50,000 investment from 'Dragons' Peter Jones, pictured, and Richard Farleigh, and the famous franchise is now worth millions . The pair became lovers after meeting, and Mr Roots asked Ms Flowers to invest the money as part of his plan to cut his business partners out, it is alleged. But Ian Glen, QC, acting for Mr Bailey, claims he never paid her back and leaving her 'skint' and unable to afford a train fare to London. Mr Glen said: 'You were looking for £5,000 and wandering in to your life was a woman who could provide £5,000. 'She gave you £5,000 for this business and she was skint by the time the bowl came round wasn't she, because you took what she had. She said she couldn't afford to come to London.' Tony Bailey claims Mr Roots stole his secret recipe and took it on Dragons Den in 2007 . Mr Roots replied: 'I don't think the proposed £5,000 was all her money. She came to the carnival. 'Ms Flowers made it quite plain that she fancied me. I was doing the sauce at the time.' Mr Glen asked: 'Did you repay her?' Mr Roots replied: 'Yes.' Ms Flowers previously gave evidence claiming that she had received no money from her former lover since his business took off. An expert witness, advisor to the food industry Vince Craig, told the court Mr Bailey's recipe was 'commercially unusable' as it was too vague and designed to be made on a domestic scale. Mr Roots claims he created the sauce from a basic jerk sauce recipe, before experimenting with adding and removing ingredients until he arrived at Reggae Reggae sauce and didn't use Mr Bailey's list of ingredients, which Mr Bailey claims is the basis of Reggae Reggae. Company director of Meadowbrae Technical Services Limited Mr Craig cooked both Mr Bailey's sauce and Mr Roots' from the original recipes. Giving evidence at the High Court yesterday, Mr Craig said: 'It [Mr Bailey's] was commercially unusable. I had to make a number of assumptions due to the differing numbers on the recipe. 'I had to make a guess at which all purpose seasoning was used because it didn't specify. 'That was challenging. I had to take a guess as to consistency as there was no indication of that on the instructions. 'The sauce that I attempted to make I found thinner in consistency, slightly lighter in colour, harsher to the mouth, so when you put it in your mouth it hit you very hard, very quickly on the front end of your tongue and back of your mouth. 'The Reggae Reggae sauce is slightly darker, thicker and you enjoy the pleasure of the fruitiness of the tomatoes first before you get the heat that comes in at the second stage.' Mr Bailey and Mr Williams are suing Mr Roots for a third share each in the sales of Reggae Reggae sauce, thought to be more than £300,000 a piece. The claim breach of confidence, over the sauce recipe, and breach of contract. Mr Roots denies their claims, saying he came up with the sauce from a basic Jerk Sauce recipe, and that Mr Bailey had 'no interest' in the commercial marketing of the Reggae Reggae Sauce. He also insists Mr Williams was due to provide £5,000 finance - but never did, so he decided to go it alone, and by the time he appeared on Dragons Den, both were history.

The new series of Toddlers & Tiaras aired last night, and true to form it presented a whole new set of shocking behaviours from fame-hungry pageant parents. The hit TLC show, which has focused on child beauty pageants in Texas and Maryland in the past, launched its new season in New York where we met Isabella, five-years-old and Shian, eight-years-old and their mothers. The new season also marked the return of three-year-old Paisley, who famously sparked outrage from viewers when her mother dressed her in a Pretty Woman prostitute costume last year. Too much: Eight-year-old Shian is made to carry weights by her mother Trisma as she runs around the block in preparation for her pageant performance. She is just one of the extreme stars of TLC's Toddlers & Tiaras . Shian, from . New Jersey is shown carrying purple weights as she runs around the block in preparation for her . pageant appearance. The behaviour is guided by her mother Trisma. The mother also reveals she makes her daughter sleep in a girdle at night.

It's proving to be a bitter and ugly custody battle between Halle Berry and her ex Gabriel Aubry over their daughter Nahla. And according to reports today, the former couple have been told they should take parenting classes together to see how their war is affecting their three-year-old girl. Halle, 45, and 36-year-old Gabriel, were in court today, have been recommended to take the classes by the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services. Bitter battle: Halle Berry arrives at Los Angeles Superior Court today in the ongoing custody battle against her ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry over their daughter Nahla . Strained relations: Halle and Gabriel have apparently been advised to attend parenting classes by the authorities in a bid to iron out their difficulties for the sake of their daughter . Halle was pictured arriving at Los Angeles Superior Court this morning. A source told RadarOnline today that . the classes were recommended to the estranged pair in the hope that they . will see how their fighting is affecting their daughter. The . source said: 'The report recommends that Halle and Gabriel attend . parenting classes together, so that they can co-parent Nahla together. The classes will give them the tools to work through their issues, and . hopefully become better parents for it.' It was also reported yesterday, on TMZ, that Aubry has 'agreed to take anger management . classes' following an incident where he is alleged to have 'pushed' his . daughter's nanny. The website also reported that the couple have been requested to attend mediated sessions, in which they would be accompanied by a third party as they decided how to best raise their child, which apparently Halle was receptive to, although Gabriel was not. And the US website also report that the DCFSe have recommended counselling for Nahla. Halle and dad Gabriel Aubry: He has reportedly agreed to take anger management classes . According . to TMZ, the 36-year-old male model and his former girlfriend spent . hours yesterday with representatives from the Los Angeles County . Department of Children and Family Services. It is claimed by sources that social workers concluded Aubry 'needed to work on his anger issues.' A law enforcement source connected with the case told the website: . 'Gabriel has a little bit of a temper, but the good news is that he . realises it.' The recommendation stems from an incident earlier this month in which . Gabriel allegedly pushed the nanny while she was holding three-year-old . Nahla. Halle was advised to seek . professional help after the nanny claimed Gabriel screams at the child . and violently yanked Nahla from her arms. In turn, Gabriel is asking for a restraining order as he believes she's inventing lies to side with Halle. Today in court it is said that Halle has asked for Aubry to have only just supervised visits with Nahla, according to Radaronline.com. 'Halle is asking the judge to order . monitored visitation for the entire time that Nahla is with Gabriel . pending the outcome of the criminal investigation,'  a source told the website. 'Currently, the nanny, under terms of the current custody agreement is . with both parents from 12:30 p.m. until Nahla goes to sleep. 'Halle . doesn't want Nahla alone with Gabriel at all right now, period. Gabriel . is absolutely opposed to monitored visitation because he feels he has . done nothing wrong.' It has also been reported that Gabriel wanted to meet with the LAPD to clear his name. 'Gabe was more than willing to meet with law enforcement, he has nothing to hide. He was under NO obligation to meet with cops, but recognized this was something he needed to do to erase this cloud of suspicion that has been lingering over him,' a source told Radar. Tender moment: Oliver Martinez and Halle Berry's daughter Nahla were seen sharing a tender kiss together as they spent the day at the beach in Malibu . 'He is hopeful that criminal charges won't be filed against him. While Gabriel is still under investigation for child endangerment and battery, many insiders believe that he won't be charged. Berry is reportedly paying her ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry's legal fees in connection with their ongoing custody dispute. 'Halle has been ordered by the judge . to pay Gabriel's legal fees. It's not uncommon in custody dispute cases . when the parents aren't married, to have the person that earns more . money, pay for the other side’s legal bills. 'It's so that both sides will have a . level playing field, and fees in custody disputes are racked up very . quickly,' a source told Radar. Meanwhile, Nahla was oblivious to the drama as she enjoyed a day at the beach on the weekend with her mother's beau Olivier Martinez. The 46-year-old French actor showed off his paternal side as he watched the three-year-old playing. Look at me: Nahla showed off her skills on the swing as Olivier played along .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 19:49 EST, 14 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:42 EST, 15 March 2012 . A boy who disappeared as a baby had been found eight years later and is set to be returned to his family. Eight-month-old Miguel Morin was being cared for by his godmother, Krystle Tanner, at the time of his disappearance in 2004. This week Tanner, 26, has been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping the boy, now aged eight, and Miguel has been taken in to the care of Texas Child Protection Services. His discovery came as a surprise, since the case was officially abandoned in 2006. Found: Miguel Morin, left, went missing in 2004 while being babysat by his godmother Krystle Tanner, right . His mother Auboni Champion-Morin has spoken of her joy at Miguel's re-appearance. She told KPRC: 'Right now, I'm just really anxious to see him, but I know there is a lot of legal stuff I have to do. 'I want to hold him in my arms and let him know who I am. I hope he can feel the same thing I feel for him.' Ms Champion-Morin, who has five other children, had fallen on hard times in November 2004 when she asked her close friend Tanner to look after Miguel overnight at her apartment in Houston. When she went to pick him up in the morning, they had both gone, and Tanner's mother claimed they had fled Texas. Police investigated the case but were unable to track Tanner down, and two years later the case was closed. However, Ms Champion-Morin says she was never told that authorities were no longer investigating, and found it difficult to get information on the status of the case. Relief: Auboni Champion-Morin is delighted at the prospect of being reunited with her long-lost son . A police spokesman said the case had disappeared from their databases and they did not even know the child's name. 'It was very difficult because we were essentially searching for a ghost,' he said. A fresh breakthrough finally came last August, when officials received a complaint about Tanner, according to CNN. It was reported that she had hit an eight-year-old boy in her care - but child welfare officials were unable to meet with the boy. She also apparently gave contradictory answers to officials' questions, and changed her story about whether or not the child was her own son. This prompted the authorities to turn the case over to police, who opened a criminal investigation. Tanner was arrested in San Augustine, 165 miles from Houston, earlier this week but was reportedly unco-operative and refused to reveal Miguel's whereabouts. However, yesterday her sister called police and said that the boy was with her, later turning him over to authorities. Miguel is said to be in good health, and will be re-united with his family after his mother takes a DNA test proving that he is her son. He is believed never to have attended school, and to have been called names like 'Dirty' by Tanner. Ms Champion-Morin told KTRK that her friendship with the alleged kidnapper had made the ordeal even tougher. 'I knew this family,' she said. 'It wasn't like, ""Hey stranger."" No, I knew this family. I spent time with them. We had Thanksgivings and Christmases.' Although the family will seek counselling to ease Miguel's re-entry into the life from which he was separated as a baby, Ms Champion-Morin is optimistic that he will settle in. 'We love him very much and we never gave up. That's one thing I would never give up.'","Miguel Morin was abducted in 2004 when he was eight months old .

These are the pictures that show a seasoned shark expert and professor catching one of the largest bull sharks on record. Neil Hammerschlag, who is an associate professor at the University of Miami, caught the massive sea creature during an on-going survey project to capture and tag sharks. He said he’s floored that creatures like that still swim around in the open water. ‘It’s an amazing sign to know they’re still out there,’ he told the Miami Herald earlier this month. The pictures show the colossal creature being brought aboard the ship’s drum, where the female bull shark was then tagged and released into the open water. Fish tale: Marine scientist Neil Hammerschlag was conducting a research tagging project when he and his team snared a lethal bull shark that weighed as much as 1,000 pounds . Mind the mouth: Hammerschlag, far right, poses with his team and the shark while keeping a wary eye on the colossus . As soon as he began to pull on the fishing line, Hammerschlag could tell this was no ordinary catch. 'We . didn't know if we were pulling up a sunken boat, a monster shark, a . school bus — we had no idea which it was,' Hammerschlag told OurAmazingPlanet. It turned out to be a monster - a 10 foot long bull shark weighing in at over 1,000 pounds, to be precise. 'As soon as it came to the surface, . it literally took my breath away, it was so big,' Hammerschlag said of . the beast caught in the Florida Keys. Hammerschlag, a shark researcher and professor at the University of Miami, spends every other weekend hunting for sharks in Southern Florida. He has caught more than a thousand sharks over the years, which he and his team label with either a satellite tag or an ID tag, take muscle and fin samples, as well as a vial of blood before releasing the animal back into the ocean. And, on May 27, Hammerschlag and his team tagged their biggest shark to date. The scientist says that he can usually bring in a line by himself but this time he needed a colleague to help. Hauling it in, the massive, female bull shark took their breath away, Hammerschlag said.  The researchers estimated that it weighed more than 1000 pounds. Bull sharks tend to weigh between 200 and 500 pounds. After fitting the massive shark with an ID tag, they released her back into the deep blue. A blood sample will determine whether or not she is pregnant. Bull sharks are the region’s top predator and, like other species, females tend to be larger than males. Both male and female bull sharks have the most testosterone of any animal on the planet, according to Hammerschlag. Shark Hunter: The researchers caught the massive animal in the reefs near the Florida Keys, they released the bull shark back into the deep blue after tagging it with an I.D . Like great white sharks and tiger sharks they have serrated teeth which allow them to tear apart their meals and go after bigger prey. Bull sharks also like to swim in shallow, coastal waters and are unusual in their ability to survive in freshwater. They have previously been found in rivers around the world, including the Mississippi river. Hammerschlag reassured Our Animal Planet that the sharks don’t specifically target humans: 'They possess the machinery but lack the motivation.’ That said, experts often say that Bull sharks are the most dangerous in the world and are often blamed for unprovoked, deadly attacks. Of the 29 shark attacks in the U.S. last year, 11 happened in Florida. None were fatal.","Enormous female bull shark captured off the coast of Florida in May - the largest on record .

The Daily Mail and the Big Lottery Fund today award more than £6million to charities and organisations helping to improve the lives of older people. The joint initiative, known as the Silver Dreams Fund, is part of a wider campaign to distribute National Lottery grants totalling £110million to the most inspirational and worthy projects. In the spirit of this paper’s long-running Dignity for the Elderly campaign, the money will be given to causes that enhance the lives of those over 50 and recognise the contribution they make to society. Awards: Bel Mooney, centre, with Big Lottery Fund England committee member Geoff Wilkinson, back left, and Daily Mail readers Christine Squires and Marilyn Tenbeth . The first tranche of the money is today awarded to 37 voluntary and community groups in England that will receive grants of up to £200,000 each. They include a farm project to ease loneliness in rural areas and a charity to help former Gurkhas resettle in England. An appeal for nominations last October prompted an incredible response from charities and organisations which submitted nearly 1,500 applications for grants. Daily Mail columnist Bel Mooney and . three readers, David Searle, Christine Squires and Marilyn Tenbeth, . joined Lottery representatives and independent experts to decide the . winners. The panel awarded . grants of between £50,000 and £200,000 to the organisations to test and . develop innovative ideas to help older people over 12 to 18 months. Up to five of those projects, which all help those over 50 to cope with issues such as health, isolation and bereavement, will then receive up to £1million each to carry their ideas forward. The panel’s choices will help determine how the rest of the £110million, which represents the Big Lottery Fund’s biggest single investment in older people, is spent between now and 2015. The Big Lottery Fund has calculated that the money already allocated will benefit around 16,690 people directly, as well as helping 3,700 volunteers. Charities and organisations that will . receive grants include Come Dine With Us, a lunch club in Durham which . encourages healthy eating, and Care And Repair England, a charity which . helps older people ensure building work is satisfactory.

There's a lot of resentment out there for families exactly like this, especially now, especially with the country in the state that it's in, there's not much money and people have seen families maybe like this one taking advantage.' Carole Malone said on This Morning that there was a lot of resentment for the Philpott family . Grief-stricken: Mick and Mairead Philpott, the parents of six children that died following a fire at their home in Derby last week, appeared at a news conference yesterday . Mick and Mairead Philpott were inconsolable yesterday during a press conference about the house fire . Her comments were met with anger on Twitter with one user known only as Ellen saying: 'Carole Malone fails at empathy, sensitivity, decency and humanity. 6 children burned to death. Stem your hatred for a few minutes.' Ms Malone added: 'This family became a target a couple of years ago and I suspect they have many enemies out there because they were seen to be on benefits, they were seen to be asking for a bigger council house and I think they upset a lot of people at the time.' She was speaking the morning after the fire claimed its sixth victim, 13-year-old Duwayne Philpott, who succumbed to his injuries over the weekend. His parents, Mick and Mairead, broke down in tears yesterday as police confirmed that an arsonist had started the blaze and petrol had been poured through the family's letterbox. Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers John, nine, Jack, seven,  Jessie, six, and Jayden, five, all perished as flames and smoke engulfed their council house in Derby. Mr Philpott's actions were praised by Schofield who was echoing comments by Ann Widdecombe who said that he did what he could to save his children's lives.

Front row, from left, Shareen and Jesse with Mrs Philpott, Duwayne and John . When Schofield pointed out that accelerants had been used so it didn't appear to have been an accident, Malone responded by suggesting the family had brought it on themselves. She said: 'I mean the culture of the family and the fact that they consistently did interviews about their situation. They did bring attention to themselves. The tragedy; this is what's happened. Six innocent children have died as a result.' Sixth victim: Duwayne Philpott, 13, died in hospital after his parents made the difficult decision to turn his life support machine off . On YouTube, user Thibor65 wrote: 'This is despicable! No one, Whether rich or poor, employed or unemployed deserves to lose a child, let alone 6! This ""person"", I use the term loosely as any normal thinking person would think ""Is this comment going to hurt people that are grieving?"", is abhorrent.' There were people who agreed with Malone, however, with Lee Hadfield from Leeds saying: 'I can't help but think that Carole Malone might be right about the comments she made on @itvthismorning' Distancing themselves from Malone's comments, a spokesman for This Morning said: 'The views expressed in the This Morning newspaper review on Monday were those of Carol Malone and not shared by ITV or This Morning. 'Our thoughts are with the family and all those affected by this tragedy at this difficult time.' Today it emerged hundreds of people are to join hands in a mile-long human chain to help pay for the children's funerals. The fund-raiser will see 1,600 people each pay £1 for the funerals, which are due to take place at Derby Cathedral on a date yet to be fixed. The funerals were originally due to be held at a local Roman Catholic church, but have been moved to the cathedral because of the large number of people who want to pay their respects . The Philpotts want each coffin to arrive at the cathedral in a horse-drawn hearse. A series of events have been organised by the local community in support of the family. Anthony Slater, who is co-ordinating the events, said: 'The response from the community has been nothing short of overwhelming. 'Quite often people keep themselves to themselves but this tragic event has helped unite them in their grief and support for Mick and Mairead. 'Everyone in the area knows Mick, Mairead and the children and everyone knows how much he loved not just his own children but other people’s children too.' Mr Slater said hundreds of people from across the world had offered to help raise money for the funerals and surviving family members. The human chain event will take place on Tuesday, June 5; starting at the Philpott family home where the blaze took place and finishing at a local park. Other fund-raising events include a 16-mile walk ending in Derby city centre. Local schools are allowing children to come to school without wearing their uniforms tomorrow to raise money for a trust set up to help the Philpotts. Police are yet to establish who started the fire that killed the six children or what their motive was but said yesterday they were ruling no one out. One line of inquiry is that the family was targeted because of its ‘celebrity status’. Mr Philpott, a father of 17 children by five women, became known as ‘Shameless Mick’ in 2007 after demanding a larger house to share with his wife, his girlfriend Lisa, and eight of  his offspring. When asked if Mr and Mrs  Philpott would be quizzed as  suspects, officers refused to comment. Appearing at a press conference yesterday, Mr Philpott, 54, repeatedly broke down in tears while describing the events of last Thursday night and thanking the authorities for their efforts in trying to save his children. Mr and Mrs Philpott are believed to have been sleeping downstairs when petrol was poured through the letterbox of their three-bedroom council house and ignited with a match or a cigarette lighter. The fire then funnelled upstairs, with smoke filling the rooms where the children were sleeping. Respect: Well-wishers have left hundreds of cards, flowers, teddy bears and candles after a candlelit vigil . Mr and Mrs Philpott were woken by a smoke alarm but ‘valiant’ attempts to save the children were unsuccessful. Mr Philpott said: ‘I want to thank my three eldest children because they have helped us cope. And then there’s a young lad who tried to get in the house the same as myself. ‘Then of course there is the four firemen, the police, the ambulances, the doctors and nurses – everybody who tried to help save our children. ‘We can’t express our gratitude enough. It’s not just us that have suffered, it’s them as well – it’s everybody.’ Mr Philpott said that his son Duwayne’s organs had been donated to save the life of another child. ‘That makes us happy and it takes a bit of the pain away,’ he added. ‘We grew up in a community that’s been through a lot of problems with violence and to see this community come together like it has, it’s too overwhelming. 'Those poor gentlemen from the fire  brigade, who saw what we saw – my heart goes out to them.’ Steve Cotterill, Assistant Chief Constable at Derbyshire Police, said: ‘The seat of the fire was inside the front door below the letterbox and there are clear indications petrol was used as an accelerant to light the fire. ‘The consequence was the fire took hold and smoke went upstairs to where the children were sleeping. Tragically, those children died of smoke inhalation.’ Mr Cotterill added that authorities were ‘not ruling anybody out’ as suspects. Mr and Mrs Philpott are yet to be questioned fully because it would have been ‘utterly inappropriate’ so soon after the tragedy, he said. Mr Philpott’s former mistress, Lisa Willis, 28, and her brother-in-law Ian Cousins, 38, had  been arrested on suspicion of murder before being released without charge. Miss Willis shared the home in Allenton with Mr and Mrs Philpott until they fell out two months ago. She is in a custody battle with Mr Philpott over their five children.","Columnist said the family became a target for seeking a larger council house .

"By . Paul Sims . PUBLISHED: . 08:42 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:32 EST, 17 May 2012 . Disgraced: Grahame Maxwell, former Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police, is to get the payout despite admitting 'gross misconduct' A disgraced former chief constable who admitted gross misconduct for helping a relative get a job has walked away from the force with a £250,000 golden goodbye, it emerged yesterday. Grahame Maxwell, 51, narrowly escaped the sack over the claims of nepotism and was given a final written warning at a secret disciplinary hearing last May. But after the police authority refused to extend his £133,000-a-year contract a controversial clause legally entitling Mr Maxwell to £247,636 in compensation was activated. The clause enables Mr Maxwell to receive 85 per cent of the difference between the pension lump sum he is now eligible for after serving 28-and-a-half years and the amount he would have received had he continued for another 18 months. It is believed to be the first time the compensation clause has ever been activated following a decision not to renew a chief constable's contract. Today, the payment to the former North Yorkshire police chief was branded 'shocking' and 'ridiculous'. Skipton and Ripon Tory MP Julian Smith urged the government to overhaul the rules which entitled Mr Maxwell to the large pay-out. 'The taxpayers of North Yorkshire will find this figure shocking,' he said. 'I have already written to the Policing Minister and I am meeting with him to make the case that never again will a chief officer guilty of gross misconduct be able to take these ridiculous sums of money.' Mr Maxwell admitted making 'errors of judgement' when he helped a family member jump the queue to apply for a job within his own force in February 2010. He stepped in after a hotline set up to recruit 70 new officers was 'overwhelmed' by 500,000 applicants, many of whom were unable to get through. Former office: The headquarters of North Yorkshire Police in Northallerton . Among them was a male member of Mr Maxwell's extended family. The relative was not entitled to a 'call back', but nonetheless Mr Maxwell rang the family member himself and completed the vetting questionnaire. Mr Maxwell later admitted his involvement and in a meeting with the force solicitor allegedly described himself as an 'a***hole'. Despite his apparent admission Mr Maxwell continued to deny helping the relative and only admitted the charge of gross misconduct - a sackable offence - when his disciplinary hearing got underway. By then more than £300,000 of public money had been spent on the misconduct case. Mr Maxwell did not respond to calls from this newspaper for a comment. But the existence of the clause that entitled him to the pay-out is likely to come into sharper focus when the newly-elected police commissioners take over from police authorities at the end of the year. Under new rules commissioners will be given the power to remove chief constables from office. As a result there could be more pay-outs similar to the one Mr Maxwell received. Last night, Police Authority Chief Executive Jeremy Holderness said: 'It is important that the public understand that the Authority had absolutely no discretion in this matter whatsoever. 'Mr Maxwell became entitled to receive this payment as a matter of law, following the Authority's decision not to extend his fixed term appointment.' A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: 'Police authorities signed up to these arrangements several years ago but we are looking at them again in the light of the recent Winsor Review.' 'It recommended that misconduct hearings should have the power to remove all or part of a chief constable's severance payment and we have asked the Police Negotiating Board to consider this.' Mr Maxwell has been succeeded by temporary chief constable Tim Madgwick. The police authority said Mr Madgwick's temporary appointment was to allow the Police and Crime Commissioner, due to be elected in November, to make the final decision on a substantive appointment.","Graham Maxwell awarded sum due to special clause after North Yorkshire police refused to renew contract .

"By . Oliver Wainwright . PUBLISHED: . 17:26 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:11 EST, 18 May 2012 . Clouds of smoke belch from forests of chimneys, while armies of spidery figures scuttle to and fro between narrow terrace houses and imposing factory gates. Crowds of fans shiver on the edge of a football field, a fist-fight breaks out, and barefoot children tease a stray cat on the street corner. These are the scenes depicted in the haunting paintings of L.S. Lowry who, more than any other artist, managed to capture the strange, bleak beauty of daily life in northern industrial towns. Recognition: L.S. Lowry, (pictured in 1957), the artist from Manchester, is the subject of a major new show at the Tate Britain gallery - the first such exhibition in a public institution in London since his death in 1976 . His dream-like images captured the popular imagination, adorning chocolate boxes and biscuit tins, tea towels and jigsaws. Yet they are scarcely to be found on the walls of our major national galleries. The Tate owns 23 of his works, but has only ever exhibited one on its walls in the past 20 years — and then only briefly. ‘It is a shame, verging on the iniquitous, that foreign visitors to London shouldn’t have access to the painter English people like more than most others,’ thundered the actor Sir Ian McKellen in a television documentary last year, suggesting an anti-northern, anti-working-class conspiracy against the flat-capped Lancastrian. Disappointing: Actor Sir Ian McKellen said last year it was a shame, verging on the iniquitous, that foreign visitors to London shouldn't have access to the painter . But Lowry’s exile is coming to an end. Earlier this week, the Tate Britain announced that it will stage a vast Lowry retrospective next year. It will be the first such exhibition in a public institution in London since the artist’s death in 1976. Why has it taken so long? ‘He’s a victim of his own fan base,’ said Chris Stephens, Tate Britain’s Head of Displays. ‘What makes Lowry so popular is the same thing which stops him being the subject of serious critical attention. What attracts so many is a sort of sentimentality about him.’ This is a strangely inverted piece of art world logic, where the popularity of an artist is seen as an obstacle to showing their work. What has the Tate been afraid of for all these years? Did they fear that the walls of its gallery would be breached by a violent stampede of clog-wearing northerners? The art establishment has long had a patrician aversion to proletarian schmaltz — a prejudice that Lowry is not a 'proper' artist, but someone to be confined to the gift shop. It is a stigma he battled his whole career. He was deeply ashamed of having to make a living by working as a rent-collector, seen by his contemporaries not as an artist but as 'a man who paints'. By day, he tramped the streets of Salford, from where he got so much of his inspiration. He observed children playing in the road, workers filing in and out of the factory, mothers gossiping, teenagers fighting, market traders selling their wares, and the prosaic daily grind of having to pay the rent. Later, his observations would take a darker turn, including the Blitz and subsequent rebuilding, slum clearances and new housing. The cloud of melancholy that hangs over all of Lowry’s work has a deep-rooted history in his unhappy childhood. He was born in 1887 in Stretford, between Manchester and Salford, to parents underwhelmed by his arrival. At first, his mother had difficulty even looking at him, and later expressed envy of her sister having ‘three splendid daughters’ instead of ‘one clumsy boy’. His father, who worked as a clerk for a property company, was an introverted man whom Lowry described as a ‘cold fish’, happy to fade into the background like one of his own anonymous stickmen. It was a repressive family atmosphere, and painting presented a natural escape. Or, as Lowry himself put it: 'Aunt said I was no good for anything else, so they might as well send me to art school.’ Reappraisal: A scene of Piccadilly Circus, one of L.S. Lowry's rare views of London, sold for £5.6million last year . His naive, almost cartoonish style always led many to assume he was self-taught, but he attended art college in Manchester and Salford, studying under the French impressionist Pierre Adolphe Valette. He only ever used five colours — ivory, black, vermilion, Prussian blue and yellow ochre — and worked the paint with sticks and fingers, stabbing at the canvas with both ends of the brush. The surfaces of his paintings are scratched and scruffy — a total rejection of the formality of high 'academic' style. As a result, he was often dismissed as an amateur, a ‘Sunday painter’ — to which he once retorted: 'If so, I’m a Sunday painter who paints every day of the week!' A review of one of his earliest exhibitions in 1921 described his style as ‘authentically primitive’, as if this simple creature had been discovered daubing the walls of his cave. It is a stylistic — and class-based — prejudice that has remained to this day. His paintings represent a world many have forgotten: the drudgery of pre and post-war Britain when life was rendered in shades of grey. He painted the city as it was: drenched in a grimy industrial haze.  Before the dark satanic mills were rebranded as bohemian 'loft apartments' filled with boutique galleries and organic coffee shops, they were dirty, chugging, noxious things. They were even a shock to the young Laurence Lowry, coming from the leafy Manchester suburb of Victoria Park. A lack of money forced his family move to the industrial town of Pendlebury when he was 22, replacing a familiar landscape of trees with one choked by chimneys. 'At first I detested it,' he recalled. 'And then, after years, I got pretty interested in it, then obsessed by it.' Interest: L.S. Lowry was born in Stretford, Lancashire and many of his drawings and paintings depict scenes of life in the industrial districts of Northern England . One day he missed a train and happened upon the Acme Spinning Company’s mill, ‘a huge black framework of rows of yellow-lit windows standing up against the sad, damp charged afternoon sky’. The mill was turning out at the end of the day, hundreds of bodies flooding out of the gates, a swarm of ants moving as one tidal mass. ‘I watched this scene — which I’d looked at many times without seeing — with rapture.’ Lowry’s was always a particular kind of observation, conducted at a remove from the people in his gaze. It is telling that his scenes are always painted from a raised, bird’s eye viewpoint, looking down on the life played out below as if a children’s game. H  is people are pliable, doll-like figures, observed from a safe distance, without ever getting too involved. Faces are fleshy smears, features hidden behind turned-up collars and deep-brimmed hats. His figures are hunched, burdened things, weighed down by cumbersome clogs and bulky overcoats. Or else they are stick-thin spindles, insignificant human flotsam ready to be blown away on the next gust. For a painter who now enjoys such popularity, Lowry was singularly antisocial, a withdrawn outsider. He lived alone, never married, and at the age of 88 he claimed he had 'never had a woman', poignantly adding: 'Had I not been lonely none of my works would have happened.' Although he was not short of money in his later years, he did not earn the fortunes that his works now command. His Football Match (1949) sold at Christie’s for £5.6 million in May last year and the same astronomical price was reached by his Piccadilly Circus (1960) in November. He died just months before a retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy that broke all attendance records for a 20th-century artist. And it is this common popularity that makes Lowry so divisive. His vision of northern, working-class towns is one that has always garnered loyal popular affection, but it is this same laconic portrayal of the day-to-day public rituals of urban life, executed in a distinctly childlike manner, that has been anathema to the rarefied world of the art establishment. Collectable: L.S Lowry was not short of money in his later years, but after his death his works, including An Open Space (pictured) as featured in a sale of 20th Century British & Irish Art at Christie's, generated huge amounts at auction . And the condescension only increased as the artist’s influence spread beyond the gallery. Two years after his death, his work was the inspiration for a sing-along pop song, Matchstalk Men And Matchstalk Cats And Dogs, which spent three weeks at the top of the charts. 'He painted Salford’s smokey tops / On cardboard boxes from the shops,' sang one-hit wonders Brian And Michael on Top Of The Pops, dressed in breeches and flat caps, gently strumming their guitars, as girls from St Winifred’s School choir swayed in the background. ‘They said he just paints cats and dogs / And matchstalk men in boots and clogs / And Lowry said that’s just the way they’ll stay.’ It may not be quite what the Tate has in mind, but it provided a fitting tribute to this astute recorder of everyday modern urban life. Next year, 80 of his works will be shown together on the walls of the illustrious institution for the first time, finally installing this wild outsider in his rightful place — in the famous gallery appropriately founded by a fellow Lancastrian, sugar magnate Henry Tate.

"Scientists believe genes that help us fight viruses were inherited from Neanderthals . By . Stephanie Darrall . UPDATED: . 02:09 EST, 26 August 2011 . Ancestors: Scientists discovered as much as 4 per cent of the DNA of some people living today is Neanderthal . Virus-fighting genes inherited from different ancient human sub-species have had a positive effect on our fitness, according to U.S. researchers . Cross- breeding between ancestors of modern humans . and their extinct close relatives passed down specific genes which can still be found in our DNA. Improvements in the Homo . sapiens' immune system may also have been inherited from the Denisovans - a now-vanished human sub-species from eastern Asia. Scientists discovered last year that . ancient intimate relations meant as much as 4 per cent of the DNA of . some people living today was Neanderthal. A similar genetic study showed that up to six per cent of the modern human genome, or genetic code, was Denisovan in origin. Lead researcher Professor Peter Parham, from Stanford University, California.said cross-breeding contributed to our gene pool. He . said: 'The cross-breeding wasn't just a random event that happened, it . gave something useful to the gene pool of the modern human,' Neanderthals, who lived in western Asia and Europe, co-existed with early modern humans for several thousand years before dying out around 30,000 years ago. Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans split into different populations from a common African ancestor around 400,000 years ago . The research, published today in the journal Science, focused on immune system elements called HLA  genes. They are critical to the body's ability to identify and destroy harmful foreign invaders and are among the most variable and adaptable of human genes. DNA: Genes passed down from ancient human sub-species have improved our immune systems . Being flexible helps them stay ahead in the arms race with rapidly evolving viruses. By comparing the HLA genes of modern and extinct humans, the scientists were able to show that certain HLA carried by people today were inherited from Neanderthals and Denisovans. The ancient genes were analysed by looking at DNA extracted from fossil bones. Within one class of HLA gene, the experts estimate that Europeans owe half their variants to interbreeding with Neanderthals and Denisovans, Asians 80 per cent, and people from Papua New Guinea up to 95 per cent. The same pattern of inheritance was not seen in other regions of the human genome. Researcher Dr Laurent Abi-Rached said: 'The HLA system is unique in its diversity and the strength of natural selection acting on it. 'But it's possible that other gene systems, particularly the ones under similar pressure for variation, could show a similar pattern.'",Scientists believe genes that help us fight viruses were inherited from Neanderthals .

A schoolgirl has to eat olive oil with everything - otherwise she could suffer from life-threatening seizures. Light-weight Amy Paterson, nine, has a rare, incurable genetic condition, which means her brain can't receive enough nourishment from a normal diet. As a result she must consume three times as much fat as her friends  and drink as much double cream or olive oil in one meal as an adult would consume in a day. Amy manages to attend school and live a . normal life, but her devoted mum Michelle and dad Allan, both 44, have . to closely monitor her 1,482 calorie, six meal-a-day diet. Amy Paterson has a diet rich in double cream and fat and is pictured with some of her usual daily fare . There are only 25 people diagnosed with the condition, known as 'glut1 deficiency syndrome', in the UK, with 100 sufferers in the world. Mrs Paterson said: 'Feeding Amy is the complete opposite of feeding a normal child. 'Parents are constantly being told to cut down their child’s diet to reduce the amount of fat. 'But for Amy that’s exactly what she needs because it’s the fat that’s feeding her brain. 'She’s a thin little thing too, she weighs the same as any other nine year old girl.' Amy suffered her first seizure at just eight weeks old and endured a second just four months later. Michelle noticed the seizures hit just as Amy was being fed and that her young daughter was constantly lethargic. The worried parents, who live in Falkirk, Scotland, took Amy to several doctors, but they were baffled due to the rarity of the condition. Amy was at first misdiagnosed with ataxic cerebral palsy because of a lack of balance and unexplained tiredness. Michelle said: 'We kept saying something wasn’t right. Amy suffered her first seizure when she was eight weeks old and then when she was three months old I was feeding her baby food and she had another one, so we knew it had to be something relating to food. 'She was fighting for energy all the time - we didn’t know it was because we were giving her the wrong kind of foods.' Amy was finally diagnosed at the age of seven following a lumbar puncture at Yorkhill Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. The condition, which is caused by a faulty gene passed down from one of her parents, means Amy can’t transport glucose into her brain efficiently, leaving her starved of energy. Since her diagnosis and high-fat diet Amy has not suffered a single seizure. Amy holds a bottle of olive oil, which she pours over her meals every day, and drinks a glass of double cream . Michelle and Allan, whose 13-year-old daughter Rebecca isn’t affected by the condition, have now spoken out to warn other parents. Allan, who works as an instrument engineer for BP, added: 'Amy has to have three times as much fat in her diet as she does carbohydrates and protein. 'She takes a lot of things like triple cream, oils and fatty meats. 'It’s difficult for her but she handles the condition really well. If one of her school friends offers her some chocolate, which she loves but she can’t have because it contains too much sugar, she says no because she knows she could have a seizure. 'We don’t know why she has been affected by this faulty gene. Our other daughter is perfectly fine. 'We have to be very incredible careful, we have a massive pair of scales in the kitchen because we have to measure everything. 'The problem for doctors at the beginning was, because the condition is so rare, they didn’t know what to look for but since her diagnoses they have been fantastic. 'We have to give Amy extra olive oil with everything. If she has soup we have to top it up with oil, if she has bacon we have to add extra oil, but she seems to be used to it. I tried it once and I couldn’t handle it. 'Amy will probably have to stay on the diet for the rest of her life unless a drug is developed that can manage it. 'We just want other parents to be aware of this condition in case their child has it. Having the right diet really can make a difference.'","Amy consumes huge portions of pizza, double cream and olive oil .

Guto Harri, Boris Johnson’s ex- spin doctor, has accepted a lucrative job at News International. The former BBC journalist – who worked closely with the Tory London Mayor and helped mastermind his re-election – starts work today as communications director at Rupert Murdoch’s media company. Mr Harri’s appointment will raise questions about continuing close links between the company and the Conservative Party, which are under intense scrutiny at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards. Earlier this month it emerged that David Cameron nearly hired Mr Harri to be his spin doctor ahead of his eventual appointment of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson. Mr Coulson told the inquiry that Mr Cameron had held talks with Mr Harri but was persuaded by George Osborne to hire him instead. Mr Harri, the BBC’s former chief political correspondent, went on to become Mr Johnson’s spin doctor when he first won office in 2008 and worked with the mayor until his re-election for a second term earlier this month. It is understood that the Prime Minister made a second attempt to woo Mr Harri after he let it be known that he would be stepping down as Mr Johnson’s director of external affairs. Commenting on Mr Harri’s new job, Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ‘It feels a bit like the revolving door of the Conservative Party, the Metropolitan Police and News International continues to revolve.’ Labour’s media spokesman, Helen Goodman, said: ‘It seems that the lure of Murdoch or his money is irresistible to some people in the political world – but this is a mistake, especially after Boris called for the head of the BBC to be a Tory. ‘Of course newspapers have values but to be able to hold politicians to account they need a degree of independence from political parties, which Mr Harri is signally failing to demonstrate.’ Mr Harri, 45, who is reported to be on a salary of £250,000 a year, will be responsible for restoring News International’s battered image in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. But, after four years at Mr Johnson’s side, he will have an intimate knowledge of the thinking of a politician still tipped to succeed Mr Cameron as Tory leader. Mr Harri replaces Andrew Honnor who held the position in an interim capacity and has recently set up his own agency. Links: Labour MP Chris Bryant, left, has questioned if the appointment of Guto Harri, centre, showed continuing close ties between the company run by Rupert Murdoch, right, and the Conservative Party . Mr Johnson, meanwhile, has been criticised for initially dismissing the hacking scandal as party political ‘codswallop’ in September 2010. Documents subsequently revealed that NI was at the time offering him £2million towards an academy school in London and talking of donating millions more to sponsor another Johnson project, a cable car crossing the Thames. Pressure: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, seen walking with former adviser Adam Smith, left, will appear before the Leveson Inquiry this week . In 2010, according to emails already published by Leveson, News International executive Will Lewis asked colleagues: ‘Where are we with the schools project, particularly Boris securing the land and [Education Secretary] Michael Gove the capital investment?’ Both offers were, however, dropped shortly afterwards. Beleaguered Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt faces more pressure this week when the men at the centre of the row over his handling of the Murdoch bid for BSkyB give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry. His former special adviser, Adam Smith, and News Corporation’s chief lobbyist, Frederic Michel, will appear on Thursday, leading to fresh scrutiny of the minister’s role in the £8billion bid by the company to take full control of the broadcaster. Mr Smith quit last month after a damning 163-page dossier of emails between the minister’s office and the Murdoch empire was published during James Murdoch’s testimony to the inquiry. Mr Smith admitted he went ‘too far’ in handing sensitive information to Mr Michel, but said he acted ‘without authorisation’ from the minister. Mr Hunt insists he acted with propriety and did not know what Mr Smith was doing. News International chief executive Tom Mockridge said: ‘Guto’s experience as a communications professional, along with his solid journalistic background, means he is well qualified to lead us through the challenges we face as NI continues to change and progress.’ Mr Harri said: ‘With a proud heritage and firm commitment to serious journalism, I relish the chance to play my part in helping the new leadership secure a strong future.’ Last week, the company’s former chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, 43, was charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice along with her husband Charlie and four others. She protests her innocence.","Labour MP slams appointment of Guto Harri to role at News International .

"By . Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 07:55 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:59 EST, 17 May 2012 . Two brothers had their childhood ‘stolen’ by their mother and stepfather who kept them locked in a bedroom for up to 23 hours a day, a court was told. The boys were shut away for weeks on end, given little food and forced to take cold showers in the garden with a hosepipe. They endured the ‘oppressive regime’ for seven years and when they were eventually rescued as teenagers, they were so malnourished that neither had gone through the normal physical changes of puberty. 'Oppressive regime:' Stepfather Corin Holmes, 39, and Linsley, 41, kept their children locked up for up to 23 hours per day and fed them only basic meals . The younger, aged 17, weighed just five stone six pounds and his elder brother, aged 19, was six stone. Mother Linsley Holmes, 41, was jailed for four years and her ‘domineering’ husband Corin Holmes, 39, given a five-year prison sentence at Grimsby Crown Court. Both admitted child cruelty and false imprisonment. The case raises serious questions about social workers and teachers who failed to raise the alarm about the family. Social services had investigated them years earlier, but the case  was closed after it was decided that the boys’ ‘basic needs’ were being met by the pair. Both teenagers were allowed by the parents to attend school and college, yet their emaciated physical condition was not picked up. Eventually an investigation was launched when one of the brothers spoke to a college tutor. The court was given details of the cruel and depressing daily routine imposed on the boys from 2004 until 2011 behind the doors of the family home in Grimsby. Food amounted to two inadequate meals a day. At lunchtime they were given two slices of toast and an example of dinner was plain pasta with vegetables or Marmite. ‘Sometimes if they were in trouble they wouldn’t get any dinner at all,’ said prosecutor Megan Rhys. The boys would eat their meals apart from the adults, sitting on the living room or landing floor. When they were not at school or college they were shut in their bedroom, which had a TV with no aerial, an Xbox with no controller or games and a broken DVD player. By contrast the parents had computer games, televisions and DVDs, which they would use late into the night. Years of abuse: The brothers were only allowed out of the house (above) to go to school or college and run errands for their keepers, and weren't trusted to be alone in the kitchen or the bathroom in case they 'stole' food and hot water . Miss Rhys said the boys estimated they often spent 23 hours a day in their bedroom. A rope was used to secure the door. ‘They entertained themselves by creating fantasy games and carried them out in whispers,’ she said. They were banned from the kitchen or bathroom without supervision in case they took food or used hot water. Only one hot shower was allowed a week. Any swearing was punished by washing the boys’ mouths out with soap and water. In 2011 they escaped to buy  biscuits one morning and were punished when the wrappers  were spotted. One boy had to stay in bed for four or five days and the other for a month. ‘In the bedroom they were expected to lie silently in bed like statues,’ said Miss Rhys. On a different occasion one boy spent an entire summer holiday  confined to his bed. Linsley Holmes, who was on benefits, married factory worker Corin Holmes in 2002. The court heard he was the only father figure the boys had and they referred to him as ‘dad’. Catarina Sjolin, defending Corin Holmes, said: ‘It is not a case of sadistic brutality. ‘It is a case of strict parenting gone badly, dreadfully and seriously off-track.’ Judge David Tremberg said the boys’ physical health and emotional well-being had been seriously damaged, but he hoped  they would recover from their  ‘stolen childhood’. The court heard they had both put on weight and ‘improved immensely’ since being rescued.","Brothers, now 17 and 19, weighed just 5st 6lb and 6st each when they were rescued .

Police investigating the disappearance of a young girl from her family's southern Arizona home said that child welfare workers went to the household in December, but authorities declined to provide additional details. The disclosure came nearly a week after the father of 6-year-old Isabel Mercedes Celis was barred from having any contact with his 10- and 14-year-old sons. Tucson police spokeswoman Sgt. Maria Hawke confirmed the visit but said she couldn't describe the circumstances that prompted it. The child welfare call was first reported by the Arizona Daily Star. Scroll Down for Video . Revelations: Police say that child-welfare officials went to the home of missing Isabel Mercedes Celis nearly five months before her disappearance . Tasya Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of Economic Security, which oversees the state's child welfare agency, declined to confirm the visit or say why the girl's father, Sergio Celis, isn't allowed to be with his two boys. Authorities have been searching for Isabel since her father reported her missing April 21. Family members have said they last saw her in her bedroom the night before. A window was later found open with the screen pushed aside. A few days after the disappearance, a neighbor told KVOA-TV that she heard her dogs barking and male voices outside her bedroom window around 6:30 a.m. on the day Isabel was reported missing. The neighbor said there were no sounds that indicated a struggle. Police have declined to comment on those details. Missing since April 21, 6-year-old Isabel Mercedes Celis (left and right) was declared by police to have been abducted from her Tucson Arizona home . Earlier this week, police released 911 recordings of Sergio Celis reporting his daughter missing. He was calm while Isabel's mother, Rebecca Celis, was full of emotion. Calls to Sergio and Rebecca Celis weren't returned Thursday afternoon. And now after almost one month of the investigation into the disappearance of Isabel Mercedes Celis, including interviews with more than 500 sex offenders and examining 1,000-plus tips, police have acknowledged for the first time that the 6-year-old was taken from her home. But so far, authorities in Tucson, Arizona, haven't been able to name a suspect in the case. Revelations over the past week that Isabel's father, Sergio Celis, has been barred from seeing her two brothers raised questions about the focus and pace of their investigation. Yesterday, nearly a month since she went missing, police confirmed for the first time that she was abducted, rather than characterizing the case as a 'suspicious disappearance/possible abduction.' Authorities have been searching for the girl since her father reported her missing April 21. Family members have said they last saw her in her bedroom the night before. A window was later found open with the screen pushed aside. A few days after the disappearance, a neighbor told KVOA-TV that she heard her dogs barking and male voices outside her bedroom window around 6:30 a.m. on the day she was reported missing. The neighbor said there were no sounds that indicated a struggle. Police declined to comment on her account. Little girl lost: Authorities have been searching for the Isabel Celis since her father reported her missing on April 21. Family members have said they last saw her in her bedroom the night before . Pleas: Becky and Sergio Celis ask for the return of her daughter Isabel, six, at a volunteer center close to their Tucson, Arizona home last month . Authorities searched for Isabel in a three-square-mile area around her home, ponds, dry streambeds and empty houses. They also searched her house, but a judge has sealed those records until at least later this month. Police had examined the possibility that Isabel was in Mexico because of Tucson's close proximity to the border. Federal authorities have been in touch with Mexican police officials who checked hotels, bus terminals and other businesses as they looked for her. Meanwhile, Sergio Celis, an opera singer, sang 'Ave Maria' at a May 6 benefit to raise money for the search for his daughter. Finding Isa: Daniel Cadena, foreground, holds a candle along with his mother, Angela Sanchez, left and his aunt, Areliz Sanchez during a recent vigil . Missing: Police believe Isabel Celis, 6, was taken from her Tucson home the night of April 20 . Police announced in a news release late last week that Arizona's child welfare agency was barring him from having any contact with his 10- and 14-year-old sons. On Monday, after a regularly scheduled news conference, investigators released 911 recordings of him reporting his daughter missing. He was calm while her mother's reaction was full of emotion. Sergio Celis told a 911 operator that he believed his daughter was abducted. Asked to explain why he thought that, Celis said, he couldn't and that Isabel wasn't there when the family awoke. 'I want to report a missing person,' he said, calmly. 'My little girl, who is 6 years old. I believe she was abducted from the house.' Evidence: The video shows two males and three females walking in a parking lot in the direction of the Celis home on the night she went missing between 1 and 1:30am . The tone of Celis' wife, Rebecca, was frantic. 'She's only 6,' said the mother as she cried. 'Can you please hurry and get somebody over here?' Calls to Sergio and Rebecca Celis weren't returned Tuesday. Michael Piccarreta, a criminal defense lawyer in Tucson who isn't involved in the case but has followed it, said family members are normally eliminated as possible subjects at this point in investigations. In some cases, he said, police focus on family members longer than usual. 'That doesn't mean they are guilty,' Piccarreta said. 'It could mean the police are having difficulty with an alternative theory.' Police spokeswoman Maria Hawke said investigators have eliminated one theory. Innocent: Tucson police have scoured the girl's home and interviewed more than 500 sex offenders in the area since Isabel disappeared . 'She didn't get up and leave the house on her own,' Hawke said. She declined to discuss the evidence that led investigators to make that conclusion or reveal details about who they suspect took her. Experts say the abduction of a child from a home is relatively rare. Police are holding out hope that Isabel is still alive. Tasya Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of Economic Security, which oversees the state's child welfare agency, declined to comment on why Sergio Celis isn't allowed to be with his two boys. She also declined to say whether there were any past calls at their home. Vanished: Isabel has now been missing for nearly a month and the search has expanded as far as Mexico . The Arizona Daily Star had reported early Tuesday that police concluded that Isabel was abducted. Lynn Jones, a criminology professor at Northern Arizona University, said the public will connect the decision to prohibit Celis from seeing his sons with the 911 recordings because they were both released around the same time. 'So law enforcement, I would imagine, would have to do some work if they don't want them to be perceived together,' Jones said. Hawke said it was a coincidence that the two pieces of information were released at once and that the child welfare decision was released to keep the public informed of the investigation. News organizations had been requesting the 911 recordings, which take a while to prepare and happened to be ready on the same day as the child welfare news conference. 'People are free to form their own opinions,' Hawke said. David Pike, who lives on the same block as the Celis family and whose sons used to play with Isabel's brothers, said he is perplexed by how calm the father sounded in the 911 phone calls. 'It just struck me as odd. I get excited easily if I think one of my kids are hurt ... and then there's times I've just sat there dumbfounded. 'Maybe that was a dumbfounding moment for him and he wasn't able to wrap his mind around it right away,' he said. 'Maybe he truly thought she was playing a game,' Pike said.

British merchant seamen who were kept as prisoners-of-war in Germany passed the time by holding elaborate horse racing events, a newly discovered archive has shown. The Merchant Navy Jockey Commission (MNJC) was formed by Andy Fairgrieve in 1941 to hold meetings and raise money for charity during World War Two. Inmates built an indoor track measuring nearly 36ft in length and the small 'horse' pieces were moved along by 'race course' officials after dice were rolled. It was arranged so that six runners could follow a field varying in length from six furlongs to 1.25 miles. A cartoon drawn at the time shows how British merchant seamen who were kept as prisoners of war in Germany passed the time by holding elaborate horse racing events . A plan showing various horses' colours and how the tote machine was constructed. The Merchant Navy Jockey Commission (MNJC) was formed by Andy Fairgrieve in 1941 to hold meetings and raise money for charity during WWII .

They even fashioned an electronic board so that onlookers could keep an eye on the progress of their fancies. During the weekly meetings, there were three races of six furlongs, two steeplechases of one mile and a final event of a mile and a quarter - up to 600 men watched each meeting. Mr Fairgrieve’s 'Wartime Log' includes race results and betting history and also numerous cartoon drawings of the prisoners enjoying the occasions.

Witnesses claim Mr Bourke – a former prison officer – drove his car on the wrong side of the road before stopping near a group of 250 protesters. They were workers from three prisons within the 'Sheppey Cluster' –  Swaleside, Elmley and Standford Hill  – angry about cuts to pensions and part of a national public service workers' walkout on May 10.

It is alleged that Mr Bourke grabbed and pushed Malcolm Young, a branch official of the Public and Commercial Services Union, swore at him and said: 'Get out of the way.' Earlier, Mr Bourke is said to have phoned Kent police, who sent two officers in a van to investigate his claims that the pickets were causing an obstruction outside the prison. The officers concluded that no offence had been committed and decided to take no action. Later, after a second call from the jail, Kent Police Chief Inspector Peter de Lozey went to the scene. After talking to pickets, he also decided against any action. Sources said last night that Mr Bourke had denied pushing anyone or swearing.

Three men accused of making Molotov cocktails had been planning to attack President Barack Obama's campaign headquarters, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's home and other targets during this weekend's NATO summit, prosecutors said Saturday. The suspects have been identified as Brian Church, 20, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Jared Chase, 24, of Keene, New Hampshire; and Brent Vincent Betterly, 24, of Oakland Park, Massachusetts. They are each being held on $1.5million bail. The trio is facing charges of conspiracy to commit terrorism, possession of an explosive or incendiary device and providing material support. Suspects: Brian Church (left), Jared Chase (center) Brent Vincent Betterly (right) have been charged with plotting to throw Molotov cocktails at President Obama's headquarters in Chicago during the NATO summit . During the Wednesday night raid, police seized four completed Molotov cocktails in beer bottles and weapons, including a mortar gun, swords, a hunting bow, throwing stars and knives with brass knuckle handles, according to law-enforcement records cited by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. The suspects also had protective gear such as pre-positioned shields, assault vests and gas masks to help hide their identity during the planned attacks, prosecutors said. Court documents indicate that authorities likely have audio recordings of the suspects discussing their plot, which allegedly included attacking other jurisdictions. The trio also talked about planned escape routes and held late-night training sessions for engaging in combat with police, prosecutors said. ‘The city doesn't know what it's in for,' an undisclosed defendant is quoted as saying in court records. The three young men apparently came to Chicago late last month to take part in May Day protests. Six others arrested Wednesday in the raid were released Friday without being charged. Defense attorneys alleged that the arrests were an effort to intimidate the thousands of people expected to stage protests during the meeting of world leaders. They told a judge that undercover police were the ones who brought the Molotov cocktails. High alert: Security remains high in Chicago ahead of the NATO summit that will features 60 delegations from around the world . 'This is just propaganda to create a climate of fear,' defense attorney Michael Duetsch said. Later, outside the courtroom, Duetsch said two undercover police officers or informants who called themselves 'Mo' and 'Gloves' were also arrested during the Wednesday raid, and defense attorneys said they later lost track of the two. 'We believe this is all a setup and entrapment to the highest degree,' Duetsch said. Chicago police Lt. Kenneth Stoppa declined to elaborate on the case beyond confirming the charges against the three who were still in custody. The suspects’ attorney, Sarah Gelsomino, said her clients are ‘absolutely in shock and have no idea where these charges are coming from.’ Carefully guarded: Protesters walk past Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's house today as police officers guard it . Activist Bill Vassilakis, who told the New York Daily News that he let the men stay in his apartment, described Betterly as an industrial electrician who had volunteered to help wire service at The Plant, a former meatpacking facility that has been turned into a food incubator. Vassilakis described the 24-year-old as a ‘stand-up’ guy and said that the charges against him were unwarranted. ‘He and the other guys had done nothing but volunteer their time and energy,’ he said.’ Betterly appears to have a history of minor run-ins with law enforcement. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported that in February, Betterly was cited for disorderly intoxication after taking a swim in a high school swimming pool and vandalizing the cafeteria. The case, however, was later dismissed. March: Protesters held an impromptu rally on the Michigan Avenue bridge on Friday . Chase grew up in New Hampshire and moved to Boston a few years ago before becoming active in the Occupy movement, said his aunt, Barbara Chase. Church is an emergency medical technician and is studying to become a paramedic, according to his mother, who asked to remain anonymous. She added that her son supports the Occupy movement and traveled to Chicago in late April to join the anti-NATO protests. One of the other six protesters who were jailed and released, activist Darrin Annussek, of Philadelphia, denied there were Molotov cocktails, or the raw materials needed to make them, in the apartment. ‘No way,’ Annussek told reporters after his release. ‘If I had seen anything that even resembled [a Molotov cocktail], I would have left.’ Annussek claimed that during 18 hours in custody, police never told him why he was arrested, read him his rights or allowed him to make a phone call. He said he remained handcuffed to a bench, even after asking to use a restroom. ‘There were guards walking by making statements into the door along the lines of `hippie,' `communist,’ `pinko,’’ he said. According to law enforcement officials, the Wednesday raid was the culmination of a month-long investigation into a group suspected of making Molotov cocktails – homemade bombs created by filling glass bottles with gasoline, the Chicago Tribune reported. However, the National Lawyers Guild, which is representing the three suspects, said they had beer-making equipment when the apartment they were staying at was swarmed by officers dressed in black and armed with battering rams and guns. Provoked: Police officers largely ignored taunts during this week's rallies and showed restraint in arresting protesters . Restraint: Police trailed protesters on bicycles and on foot during a Friday demonstration, but went out of their way to keep the number of arrests down . The men also were in a car that was stopped by police a week ago, leading to a YouTube video of the stop that has prompted protesters to complain Chicago Police were harassing the occupants, their attorney said. The two-day NATO summit will get under way on Sunday, bringing together delegations from some 60 nations, including 50 heads of state, who will discuss the war in Afghanistan and the European missile defense plan. On the first day of the talks, thousands of protesters are expected to march two-and-a-half miles to the McCormick Place convention center, where delegates will be meeting. Security has been high in Chicago in anticipation of the high-profile, although the protests have been marked by relatively few arrests. Mounted: Police horses blocked some intersections as groups of protesters who broke away from the main rally wound through the city . On Friday, police officers on bicycles and foot followed throngs of noisy activists through the streets of the city, but ignored taunts in an effort to avoid detaining people. In all, police said there was a single arrest on a charge of aggravated battery of a police officer. Another man was briefly taken into custody, but was released shortly after. Also, officers were seen trying to arrest a man who scaled a bridge tower and pulled down part of a NATO banner. Earlier, police handcuffed a man at the end of a raucous but largely peaceful rally organized by National Nurses United, one of the largest nurses’ union. Participants of the rally demanded a ‘Robin Hood’ tax on banks' financial transactions. The event drew several thousand people and featured a performance by former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, an activist who has played at many Occupy events. At one point, on the bridge at Michigan Avenue, the gateway to the city's famed shopping district, the Magnificent Mile, the number of officers swelled and they appeared ready to forcibly remove dozens of protesters who sat in the middle of street. Instead, police simply waited for the demonstrators to leave on their own.","Three men were allegedly planning to target President Obama's headquarters .

Three astronauts have arrived on the International Space Station after successfully hitching a lift on a Russian-built shuttle. NASA astronaut Joseph Acaba and Russian cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin are set for a four-and-half-month stay in space, after docking with the ISS in the early hours of this morning. The astronauts were aboard the Soyuz craft for two days, as they made their 240-mile vertical trip. It is a busy week in space - in two days there is a planned launch of the privately owned SpaceX's Dragon Capsule from Cape Canaveral. See video of the docking here: . Docked!

After safely docking on the ISS, the three astronauts had to wait for about three hours as leak and pressure checks were carried out, before they were finally welcomed by their new crew mates. The $100billion space station is currently occupied by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, NASA astronaut Don Pettit and Holland's Andre Kuipers. Before they left, Soyuz Commander Gennady Padalka, Flight Engineer Sergei Revin of Russia, and U.S. prime NASA Flight Engineer Joe Acaba were blessed by priests and wished well from dozens of onlookers that saw their spacecraft leave the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Three minutes into the flight, the crew members gave a thumbs-up signal to a camera on board the capsule. An anchor inside Mission Control outside Moscow told assembled scientists and students that the three astronauts were feeling well. Nasa, which officially retired its shuttle fleet last year, has relied exclusively on Russian Soyuz craft for space station crew transport since late 2009. According to the organisation more than 1,500 launches have been made with the craft to orbit satellites for telecommunications, Earth observation,weather and scientific missions, as well as for human flights.

A Soyuz space capsule took the first crew to the International Space Station in November 2000 and since that time, at least one Soyuz has always been at the Station, generally to serve as a lifeboat should the crew have to return to Earth unexpectedly. After the Columbia accident in February 2003, the Soyuz TMA became the means of transportation for crewmembers going to or returning from the orbiting laboratory. However, Tuesday's flight was delayed from March 30 to allow Russia's partly state-owned space contractor, RKK Energia, to prepare a new capsule for launch after an accident during pressure tests damaged the Soyuz crew capsule.

Two young men have were arrested Friday in the killings of two Chinese graduate students who were shot to death near the University of Southern California campus last month, police said. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Javier Bolden, 19, and Bryan Barnes, 20, were arrested on suspicion of the murders after material evidence directly linked both suspects to the crime scene. Barnes was arrested at a home near campus Friday afternoon, and Bolden was arrested a few hours later in Palmdale, Beck said. Both were being held without bail. Tragic: Two suspects have been arrested in the shooting deaths of USC students Ming Qu, 23, left, and Ying Wu, 23, right, last April in a suspected car robbery . KTLA reported that a 19-year-old woman was also taken into custody during Barnes' arrest. Ming Qu, of Jilin, and Ying Wu, of Hunan, were shot April 11 while sitting in a BMW about a mile away from the USC campus. Both students were 23 years old. The motive was still under investigation, Beck said, but the 'evidence points to a street robbery.' Beck said investigators believed the killings of Wu and Qu were part of a larger string of crimes committed in Los Angeles. Evidence: Police believe they were murdered either in an attempted robbery or car-jacking that left material evidence behind connecting to the suspects . 'Forensic evidence recovered at the scene linked them to two other attempted homicides,' Beck said. Material evidence directly linked both suspects to Wu and Qu, he added. The deaths sent shockwaves through the school, which has the largest number of international students of any U.S. university. Roughly 19 percent of the school's 38,000 students are from overseas, including 2,500 from China. After the shooting, Wu was found in the BMW's passenger seat and Qu was on the steps of a nearby house where he collapsed while trying to summon help, police said. On Friday, USC's president C L Max Nikias released a statement, thanking the city's mayor and police force behind the arrests. 'The arrest of the suspects in the tragic deaths of our graduate students, Ying Wu and Ming Qu, begins the process of healing and of closing a painful chapter in the life of our community. We will always mourn the loss of Ying and Ming, but find comfort in the hope of achieving justice,' Mr Nikias wrote. Blown out: The windows of the BMW luxury car were blown away; Ying Wu was found slumped over in her seat, and Qu tried to get out for help . Rough around the edges: The neighbourhood, though gentrifying, is in a seedy area of Los Angeles . USC's campus is located in an urban center a few miles south of downtown Los Angeles. It is across the street from county museums and not far from the Staples Center arena and a gentrifying area of Victorian homes. Yet it is also known as an area that had faced high crime and gang activity. The victims' parents filed a lawsuit Wednesday alleging the university made false claims about safety in the 'frequently asked questions' section of its online application. The 15-page lawsuit accuses USC of hiding behind the word 'urban' and not saying the school is in a high-crime residential area. It also notes that Chinese students in particular would interpret 'urban' to mean USC is in a safe area. 'The `urban' representation misled Chinese students, including Ming Qu, into believing the area is safe since in China, the more urban the area, the safer the area,' the lawsuit states, claiming USC understood this is how Chinese students would interpret the description. USC lawyer Debra Wong Yang said the university was deeply saddened by the deaths but found the lawsuit to be baseless. Prestigious: As many as 35 per cent of USC's international student population is comprised of the Chinese . The school and city police announced new security measures after the slayings and promised more video cameras, escorts and patrols. The additional security will include sending over 30 more officers to the department division that handles the USC area, and the university will pay for four additional officers to patrol the student residential neighborhoods, Beck said. Following the students' death, Chinese media reported the two were murdered in their luxury BMW because they were 'showing off their wealth,' outraging the victims' friends. In a statement released on Thursday, classmates and friends of Wu and Qu said they are 'deeply grieved and angered at the distorted reports of our friends', reports the LA Times. As news of the shooting broke, media outlets first reported that Wu was found dead in a new BMW. Headlines in China have focused on the make of the car because luxury vehicles have become a political issue in the country. Mourning: More than 400 Chinese students participate in a memorial service on campus of the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, for the murdered couple . Rebecca Peterson lights candles at an impromptu memorial on campus for the two international students . But in their statement, friends say Qu had recently purchased the BMW, which was in fact a used 2003 model with 80,000 miles on the clock. He had planned to use the car to commute to a job after graduating this spring. They said the car had no license plates because they had not yet arrived and not because the car was new, reports the Times. 'Ying and Ming lived a simple life during their nearly two-year study at USC. In order to keep their living expenses down, they both shared rooms with other classmates. 'Ying even chose to live on the west side of campus, where it is comparatively cheaper and less safe.' The friends ended the statement by imploring people to 'ignore the rumors and help tell the truth', reports the Times. Gloria Tigolo who lives on the street where the shooting occurred said she heard a single gunshot. She went downstairs but didn't go outside because it was raining. 'It was just one big shot,' she said. 'I am amazed that one gunshot could kill two people.' Investigators said earlier that several shots were fired at the couple. Ms Tigolo said the area is peaceful and this is the first shooting she can recall since she moved to the neighbourhood three years ago.","Javier Bolden, 19, and Bryan Barnes, 20, arrested on suspicion of murders .

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 17:38 EST, 19 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:29 EST, 19 May 2012 . Jury selection is expected to begin on Monday in the murder trial of a Washington beauty school student who is accused of strangling and stabbing to death his 17-year-old classmate. Prosecutors said Christopher Scott Wilson, 31, had a fascination with death and corpses when he killed high school senior Mackenzie Cowell in February of 2010, comparing him to a serial-killing character from the television shows Dexter. Wilson also has an arm tattoo of Hannibal Lecter, the fictional serial killer from Oscar-winning movie Silence of the Lambs. Accused: Christopher Scott Wilson has been charged with first-degree murder in the 2010 death of 17-year-old Mackenzie Cowell . Star: Mackenzie Cowell was described as a popular high school girl who kept busy with work at the beauty school and her dance team . Wilson was ultimately charged with first-degree murder in a case that shocked the small agricultural city of Wenatchee, the self-described 'Apple Capital of the World'. The 31-year-old and his alleged victim could hardly be more different. Unlike her grim older classmate, Cowell was a popular girl and a member of her school dance team known as the Apple-Ettes. Reid Cowell, Mackenzie's father, recalled a driven girl with an ‘unreal schedule,’ juggling high school in the morning, beauty school in the afternoon and dance classes and dance team practice. ‘She would never have gone with anyone she didn't trust,’ Mr Cowell said. ‘The evidence tells me the chances are slim it wasn't him.’ Grim: Wilson was said to be obsessed with serial killers like the character in the TV show 'Dexter' (right), and he even got an arm tattoo of Hannibal Lecter (left . Slain: Cowell was last seen leaving her beauty school with classmate Wilson on February 9 . Wilson reportedly rejected a ten-year plea deal after the defense won all of the major pre-trial motions. Leading the defense team is John Henry Browne, the attorney who also represents the U.S. Army soldier charged in the killing of 17 Afghan villagers in March. Browne said there are some cases where he encourages clients to plead guilty, even if they are 100 per cent innocent, because the deal is too good to turn down. Reaper: During the investigation, police received a letter saying that Wilson talked about enjoying cutting people up while working at funeral homes . ‘It's a significant risk for Chris, but he's maintaining his innocence, and I admire that in him,’ Browne said. On February 9, Cowell left the Academy of Hair Design at around 3pm, telling her friends that she would be back in 15 minutes. According to court documents, Cowell was last seen driving toward Wilson's home about two blocks away from the school. Police later found her abandoned vehicle five miles away on a rural road. Her purse was still in the car, but her keys and cell phone were missing. Four days later, police found her body 20 miles away on the edge of the Columbia River. The teenager had been struck in the head, strangled and stabbed to death. In addition to the fatal wounds, the coroner also determined that someone had tried to amputate one of the girl’s arms after she died. Over the next seven months, police chased hundreds of leads and interviewed more than 800 people. Ultimately, Wilson was accused of murdering Cowell in his Wenatchee apartment, where police discovered traces of blood. Three people reported seeing a person, closely matching Wilson's description, walking down the road near where Cowell's car had been abandoned. DNA found on duct tape near Cowell's body was linked to Wilson. He was charged with the murder in October of 2010. Mutilated: The coroner said that someone tried to amputate one of Cowell's arms after she died . Tragic: Police believe Cowell was killed in Wilson's apartment, where they found traces of her blood . According to court documents cited by KirovTV, several people contacted police with concerns about Wilson after Cowell disappeared. One person wrote a letter to police claiming Wilson was obsessed with corpses and serial killers. He also claimed that the 31-year-old tried to choke his female friend, and then acted as if nothing happened. Another acquaintance claimed that Wilson told her he liked to ‘cut people up’ when he was working at area funeral homes. However, a judge barred prosecutors from introducing that work history - or mentioning his Hannibal Lecter arm tattoo - at trial. Due to the media attention surrounding this case, Wilson’s defense team has expressed concerns that it will be difficult to find a pool of potential jurors that have not been tainted by the press coverage over the past two years. Browne said he has filed a motion for change of venue, but will wait to see if an unbiased jury can be seated. Certainty: Mackenzie's father, Reid Cowell, said he has little doubt that Wilson is his daughter's killer . Once the jury selection gets under way, Browne plans to present several motions, including a request to allow testimony from a police informant who claimed two other men admitted to murdering Cowell. He will also seek to bring the two men to the stand in person, according to the Wenatchee World. The female informant named Samuel S. Cuevas and Emmanuel ‘Buddha’ Cerros Sanchez in Spring 2010, leading police to eavesdrop on the two men. However, police eventually determined that the two had strong alibis for the time of the murder. Browne also seeks to suppress photos and a video police believe show the interior of Wilson’s apartment, where Cowell is thought to have died. The images and videos involve Wilson’s friend Tessa Schuyleman, who has been accused of misleading police in the Cowell case, but never charged with any crime. Police said some of the photos show Schuyleman ‘posing as a dead person’ on the floor of Wilson’s apartment next to a stain. Investigators said the stain is Cowell’s blood, matched directly to her DNA. Wilson, however, insisted that the stain in the video was spilled water from a marijuana bong, according to defense documents. If convicted, standard sentencing calls for Wilson to serve 20 to 26 years in prison, but the judge could impose a tougher sentence. .","Trial begins on Monday, two years after Mackenzie Wilson was found dead .

David Cameron has given the green light to a new generation of Trident nuclear submarines, pitching the coalition into civil war over the future of Britain’s deterrent. The Ministry of Defence will next week reveal the names of defence firms who have won £350million of contracts to design the new super subs. The decision means the UK is set to replace the four giant Vanguard class boats with a new Bravo class of submarines, rather than downgrade the deterrent as the Lib Dems want. Making waves: David Cameron has given the go-ahead to a new generation of nuclear submarines to replace the current Vanguard class of boats, which includes HMS Vanguard (above) The successor submarines are due to come into service in 2028. And the design of the new submarines will use a new nuclear propulsion system to make the next generation of boats longer lasting and more cost effective. A senior government source said: ‘This is an important step towards renewing our nation’s nuclear deterrent into the 2060s. ‘The contracts which will be awarded to British companies will also sustain and create 1900 jobs in the UK’s world-class submarine-building industry. ‘The Royal Navy has been operating continuous at sea deterrent patrols for more than 40 years and the Successor submarines will allow us to do so well into the future with cutting edge equipment.’ Face-off: Mr Cameron's decision pitches him into a civil war with Nick Clegg's (left) Lib Dems, who want to abandon a key Cold War doctrine in order to justify a cut-price nuclear deterrent . Details of the deals were revealed as David Cameron attended the Nato summit in Chicago, where he was set to argue that the alliance needs to get smarter about defence with budgets tight. But his decision to press ahead with a full blown replacement for Trident puts him on a collision course with his coalition partners. It emerged last week that the Lib Dems want to abandon a key Cold War doctrine in order to justify a cut price nuclear deterrent. Former leader Sir Menzies Campbell, a close ally of Nick Clegg, said the UK should scrap the so-called Moscow Doctrine, which has governed nuclear policy for 40 years. Since the 1970s, it has dictated that the UK must possess the nuclear capability to overwhelm Moscow’s air defences and destroy its government and military command centre. Changing enemies: The test-firing of a Trident missile. The Lib Dems want the focus on containing the nuclear threat from smaller states like Iran, on the basis that the UK would never fight a nuclear war with Russia or China without the U.S. Cabinet Office officials are considering whether the UK’s deterrent threat should instead be based on the ability to inflict unacceptable damage on a foe by wiping out smaller cities or military facilities. They want the doctrine tweaked to focus on containing the nuclear threat from smaller states like Iran, on the basis that the UK would never fight a nuclear war with Russia or China without the United States. The Lib Dems believe the UK should scrap plans for a new generation of subs and instead adapt the existing, smaller and cheaper Astute class boats to carry nuclear tipped missiles. Lib Dem Armed Forces Minister Nick Harvey has begun a review of the options inside the Ministry of Defence on the options for a cut price deterrent. Observers believe could lead to the Lib Dems entering the next election with a pledge to scrap the nuclear deterrent altogether.","Cameron green light to new generation of nuclear subs .

Confronting an economic crisis that threatens them all, President Barack Obama and leaders of other world powers on Saturday declared that their governments must both spark growth and cut the debt that has crippled the European continent and put investors worldwide on edge. 'There's now an emerging consensus that more must be done to promote growth and job creation right now,' Mr Obama proclaimed after hosting unprecedented economic talks at Camp David, his secluded and highly secure mountaintop retreat. Seeking a second term amid hard economic times, President Obama hailed a debate heading in the direction he likes, with nations now talking of ways to spark their economies instead of just slashing spending. Members of the G8 including President Obama (centre), Angela Merkel (fourth from right) and David Cameron (third from right) pose for their group picture . France's President Francois Hollande (left), U.S. President Barack Obama, Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron and Russia's Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev attend the first working session of the G8 Summit at Camp David, Maryland May 19, 2012 . Yet there were no bold prescriptions at hand. Instead, leaders seemed intent on trying to inspire confidence by agreeing on a broad strategy no matter their differences. With all of them facing their own difficult political realities, they built some sovereign wiggle room into their pledge to take all necessary steps, saying 'the right measures are not the same for each of us.' Mr Obama played international host as Europe's debt crisis threatens to drag down the U.S. recovery and his own political future, underscoring the stakes for him in getting allies abroad to rally around some answers. Much of the new emphasis on government-led growth seemed aimed at German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who came to the summit as the European leader who had demanded austerity as the most important step toward easing the eurozone's debt crisis. But the election of Socialist Francois Hollande as president of France, and Greek elections that created political chaos in the country were clear rejections of the belt-tightening Merkel represented. President Obama walks (left) to the podium to deliver his remarks at the end of the G8 summit at Camp David in Maryland . Mr Hollande, a new voice at the table in just his first week on the job, offered President Obama a reminder of his own responsibilities to work to expand the economy, 'even if he's in an electoral period and who has a Congress that's not necessarily easy to deal with.' Coping with shaky oil markets, the leaders set the stage for a united release of world oil reserves to balance any disruption in world markets when tough new sanctions are imposed on Iran's exports because of its disputed nuclear program. The leaders said they were ready to take 'appropriate action' to meet any shortages. The mere preparation to release oil reserves could help calm markets and ensure that oil prices, which have been dropping, don't climb again and anger consumers as U.S. elections approach. The Group of Eight summit includes leaders of the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Russia. The G8 including President Obama (centre) meet to discuss the eurozone crisis and the ability of Greece to remain in the Euro at Camp David in Maryland . A joint summit statement reflected how urgently the countries must contain a financial crisis that could spread from the eurozone to the United States and infect the rest of the global economy. They declared unanimity in ensuring that Greece, which is crippled in debt and politically gridlocked, remains as part of the 17-member euro currency union. 'The leaders here understand the stakes,' Mr Obama said in summing up a packed, unusually intimate day of world talks. 'They know the magnitude of the choices they have to make and the enormous political and economic and social costs if they don't.' Mrs Merkel said growth and deficit-cutting reinforced each other and that everyone around the table agreed. 'That is great progress,' she said. As for promoting growth, she said investments under consideration include research and development, Internet networks and infrastructure. But she said 'this doesn't mean stimulus in the usual sense.' President Obama talks to the gathered media at Camp David on the conclusion of the G8 summit . Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev speaks to reporters following the G-8 Summit at Camp David, Md., Saturday, May 19, 2012 . U.S. officials agreed, saying growth measures that the Europeans might pursue don't all require outright public spending, and could be in the form of public-private partnerships or in initiatives designed to loosen credit. And the leaders stayed away entirely from the world 'stimulus,' which has taken on an unpopular political connotation, including in the United States. 'The global economic recovery shows signs of promise, but significant headwinds persist,' said G-8 leaders said. The tension between austerity and growth - whether to slash debt by cutting budgets or use public money and other means to help spur economic growth - was the backdrop as President Obama welcomed an emerging push for a balance between the two. There was time for light relief in the evening as Angela Merkel (centre left) and David Cameron (centre right) watched the Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Chelsea from Camp David . He seized the opportunity to cast the debate in terms favorable to his own re-election, closing the summit with the steps he took to right the U.S. economy and his economic vision for a second term. He said he was confident Europe could get on a path to recovery as has the United States. 'We know it is possible in part based on our own experience here,' he said. 'In my earliest days in office, we took decisive steps to confront our own financial crisis.' President Obama chose Camp David in part to encourage a freewheeling discussion out of sight of most media and potential protests, allowing the leaders to sit around a cabin table to negotiate terms, or stroll through the leafy paths for chats that seemed a world away from the typical summit convention-hall setting. It all came before Mr Obama was to lead a much larger NATO summit in Chicago on Sunday and Monday that will be heavily focused on the Afghanistan war. The G8 reached an emerging consensus that more must be done to promote growth and job creation right now according to President Obama . The drag of a eurozone crisis comes as joblessness and doubts about a life of better opportunities are already the chief concerns for American voters. In their united view, the leaders conceded some points about Merkel's push for austerity, saying budget deficits must close. But their joint statement added that budget cutting should 'take into account countries' evolving economic conditions and underpin confidence and economic recovery.' That suggested a willingness to let indebted countries take more time to reduce their deficits in line with eurozone rules in order to lessen the deadening impact of cuts on the economy. It also called for 'investments in education and in modern infrastructure,' which would involve more government spending. David Cameron (centre right) laughs with President Barack Obama (centre left) during G8 summit talks at Camp David, Maryland . That approach also meshes exactly with Mr Obama's campaign-year strategy for accelerated economic growth, which is to keep spending money on core priorities while taking on the debt through cuts and higher taxes. The statement of support for Greece remaining in the euro underlines the unpredictable damage to the global financial system that could come from a Greece departure. It follows a week of increasing speculation that Greece might not be able to stay the course, and in which a top European Union official said officials were working on emergency plans in case of a Greek exit. Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron (L to R) , U.S. President Barack Obama, and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel watch Chelsea vs. Bayern Munich Champions League final in the Laurel Cabin conference room during the G8 Summit at Camp David, Maryland . That country is facing the most acute financial crisis of the eurozone and is set to hold elections June 17 to end political deadlock. At issue is whether Greece abandons the euro to escape austerity measures. Meanwhile, Europe's woes have given shudders to Wall Street. The Fitch ratings agency dropped Greece to the lowest possible grade for a country not in default Thursday. Fitch said Greece's departure from the euro 'would be probable' if elections next month do not reverse political trends there, which have brought in politicians opposed to the terms of Europe's bailout.","'There's now an emerging consensus that more must be done to promote growth and job creation right now,' said President Obama .

A nine-year-old boy has died after being crushed by his grandfather’s horse when it fell on top of him. Kaian Burford was enjoying an afternoon riding with his brothers and cousins when the accident happened. The horse suddenly reared up twice and before falling backwards with Kaian still clinging on. It then landed on top of him. At first Kaian’s grandfather, John, believed he had just been winded. But his nose began to bleed and he collapsed moments before paramedics and his mother, Joliene Burford, arrived at the field in Markfield, Leicester. Despite the desperate efforts of the emergency services, Kaian was pronounced dead at the scene.An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned. Joliene, 32, paid tribute to her son today, describing him as her 'little smiler'. She said: “He loved life and was keen to be friends with everyone. 'People would call him ""little smiler"" and everyone always said he was a little gentleman. 'Nothing fazed him and he would have time to talk to anyone. He was a lovely boy. 'He wanted to be friends with everyone he met, and everyone he met loved him - they adored him. 'The house already seems empty without him and it’s never going to be the same.' Joliene, of Ratby, Leicester, said her father was leading the horse, which was on a long rein, in figure of eight shapes in the middle of the field when the tragedy occurred last Sunday. She added: 'It was all a complete blur, with paramedics and police and everybody coming and going. 'It didn’t seem real. It still doesn’t. I half expect him to come running in the door with his big grin on his face shouting, ""just kidding, Mum"".' Kaian also leaves his dad, Craig, sisters Beth, 16, and Piper, four, and brothers Cody, 15, and Kory, 11. He was well known in the local area for rollerskating to school every day, and for his love of BMX riding at a nearby track. Andrew Pridmore, head teacher at Elizabeth Woodville Primary School, where Kaian was in Year 4, said staff and pupils were 'devastated' by his death. He added: 'Kaian was an absolutely delightful child with a truly infectious smile He had an endless enthusiasm for everything he did. 'Everyone was his friend and everyone remembers the fun that Kaian always brought with him. 'He really had that extra special sparkle. We will miss him hugely.' Mr Pridmore said the school’s vicar and youth worker were talking to children to help them understand what had happened. He said: 'We will obviously continue to support the children in the coming weeks and months as we try to cope with this devastating loss.' A spokeswoman for Leicestershire Police said: 'Officers were called to a farm in Markfield following a report that a child had fallen from a horse and had been crushed, causing fatal injuries.'All indications are that it is a tragic accident.' Kaian’s family has asked that, instead of buying flowers, anyone who wishes to pay tribute to him send a donation towards two memorial benches they hope to install - one at his school and another at the BMX track, in Groby, Leicester, where he loved to ride.

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 18:49 EST, 20 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:50 EST, 20 May 2012 . The think tank set up by Iain Duncan Smith has dealt a stinging rebuke to the Government’s efforts to tackle family breakdown and strengthen marriage. The Centre for Social Justice said ministers are not delivering on their promises because of a Coalition ‘tug-of-war’ between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems. Its annual report card on the Government’s progress in dealing with the drivers of social breakdown highlights a string of policy failures and omissions in its approach to families. Mr Duncan Smith with his wife Betsy. A think tank set up by the Work and Pensions Secretary has criticised efforts to strengthen families . It cites the lack of progress being made in introducing transferable tax allowances and eliminating the ‘couple penalty’ in the welfare system. The CSJ also castigates the Government for its policies towards charities, in particular its decision to impose a cap on tax relief for charitable giving. Ministers get four out of ten for their measures to reverse family breakdown but score even worse – two out of ten – for their approach to the voluntary and community sector. In a foreword, the think tank’s managing director Christian Guy said: ‘There has been commendable political progress in areas such as addiction treatment strategy, education reforms and radical welfare reform. ‘Yet there is much left for the Coalition to do if it is to leave a social legacy in 2015. ‘The Government’s focus on supporting families and charities remains inadequate. ‘A political tug-of-war has once again stifled attempts to tackle the family breakdown that is devastating the poorest parts of our society. ‘And the Government must rethink its dangerous plan to cap tax on charitable donations. ‘It is wrong to brand philanthropists as tax dodgers, as the mishandled arguments of ministers have done recently. ‘It is a proposal which makes less sense as time passes and it should be dropped with haste.' The CSJ says high-profile events such as the Royal Wedding have not done enough to promote marriage . The CSJ report said ministers had so far failed to implement promises to boost marriage. ‘As leader of the opposition, David Cameron was firm in his resolve to bolster marriage and he is closely associated with the flagship policy of a transferable tax allowance,’ it said. ‘However, the Government has still not capitalised on opportunities to implement this measure. This cannot simply be down to cost.’ And it criticised the fact that Mr Duncan Smith had not laid out plans to tackle the ‘couple penalty’ in the benefits system. ‘A benefits system that disincentivises parents from living together makes it more likely that children will be raised by single parents,’ it said. The think tank has called for David Cameron to back up his promises to bolster marriage . The CSJ was set up by Mr Duncan Smith, now Work and Pensions Secretary, when the Tories were in opposition. The report card accuses ministers of repeating the mistakes of the previous Labour government by making childcare and parental leave their chief preoccupations. It suggests that differences between the Conservative and Lib Dem parts of the Coalition are responsible for a ‘frustrating lack of coherence in tackling the tragic breakdown of family life’. And it warns that last summer’s riots underline the urgency of dealing with the social challenges facing the country. The report card says the cap on charitable giving tax relief has damaged morale and demonstrated that some ministers do not appreciate the powerful and unique contribution that non-state agencies can make to tackling the most deep-rooted causes of poverty. However on other aspects of the broken society the CSJ awards the Government higher marks. It gets eight out of ten for its welfare reform efforts, seven out of ten for Michael Gove’s academies and free schools, seven out of ten for its emphasis on full recovery from drug addiction, and six out of ten for measures to help people avoid serious levels of debt. Mr Guy said: ‘The Coalition still has time to lead the radical social reforms necessary to complement economic recovery. ‘It needs to reclaim the governing initiative which characterised its early months in office, and lead the country into a new era in which even the most dysfunctional communities have their chance to play a positive part in society.’","Failure to tackle the 'couple penalty' in benefits system is criticised .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:18 EST, 16 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:18 EST, 16 May 2012 . The beautiful wife of a U.S Marine found dead on the side of the road last month was lured to her death through a conspiracy executed by the trio of defendants charged with her murder. Prosecutors allege on April 13, 22-year-old Brittany Killgore was convinced to go on a boat cruise with Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino, 36, but on the drive there with U.S Marine Staff Sgt. Louis Perez, 45, texted the word 'help' to a friend. Within minutes, according to investigators, Perez had himself texted Maraglino asking her to meet him at the home they shared with Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, and on April 17, Killgore's nude body was found on the side of the road. Dorothy Maraglino, 36, appears in court in Vista, California for her arraignment in the killing of Brittany Killgore . All three co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to murder and have been held on a $3 million bail bond. The complicated case has taken on many twists, with Perez, Lopex and Maraglino all alleged to be part of a sex-slave three way relationship. The victim, Killgore, was last seen alive wearing a purple gown on Friday 13 April before heading out to what prosecutors allege was the bogus boat cruise dinner date. She had filed for divorce from her U.S Marine husband just days previously court records revealed. Investigators have found that Killgore first met Perez, Lopez and Maraglino when she accompanied a friend to the home they all shared near to Camp Pendleton military base. She had traveled there to buy something that her friend had seen advertised online, Deputy District Attorney Patrick Espinoza said to reporters. Investigators allege that Maraglino asked Killgore to the dinner cruise as a ruse and Killgore only accepted after Perez offered to pick her up because she felt 'ill will' from Maraglino. Furthermore, the court hearing was told of the suicide note that Jessica Lynn Lopez left in a San Diego motel after she tried to kill herself on the day that Killgore's naked body was found. The note allegedly refers to Maraglino as 'Mistress' and Lopez as 'Master'. 'Master I am so sorry I dragged you into this,' the letter reads and goes on to say, 'I thought I was defending the family and it would be simple like Dexter.' The prosecution believe that is a reference to the hit television show 'Dexter' about a serial killer. It is furthermore alleged that in the letter, Lopez admits to binding and strangling Kilgore and then dumping the body near Lake Skinner in California. Authorities have not linked Killgore to the sadomasochistic lifestyle and believe that she was an innocent victim . These developments follow on after Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino, 36, of Fallbrook, California, was taken into custody last week from a hotel in downtown San Diego, Sheriff Bill Gore said in a written statement. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service assisted in the arrest, according to the statement. Mystery suspect: Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino (pictured) was arrested in San Diego in connection with the April murder of 22-year-old Brittany, Dawn Killgore . Gore said that Maraglino was taken into custody as a result of information and evidence obtained during the ongoing investigation into Brittany Dawn Killgore's death. Killgore, 22, was last seen April 13, three days after she filed for divorce from her husband, Lance Corporal Cory Killgore. Her body was found in brush near Lake Skinner on April 17. Authorities did not mention what role investigators believe Maraglino played in the alleged murder. The 36-year-old was ordered held without bail. She is expected to be arraigned on Monday at the Vista branch of San Diego County Superior Court . The other suspects in the killing are Maraglino's boyfriend, Louis Ray Perez, 45, a Camp Pendleton Marine staff sergeant, and Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, who was a roommate of Perez and Maraglino. Both have pleaded not guilty to murder. During Perez's arraignment in April, prosecutors revealed that Killgore met him for a night out after she filed for divorce. Another woman was supposed to join them, but canceled last minute. During their date, however, something apparently went awry. ‘She sent a text saying, 'Help,'' said Patrick Espinoza, a deputy San Diego County district attorney. ‘She was missing from that point on.’ According to Espinoza, investigators found Killgore's blood and a weapon in Perez's car. He also said Perez told investigators he dropped off Killgore in downtown San Diego's Gaslamp District, but investigators concluded that he lied about his whereabouts and stayed about 60 miles north in Fallbrook, where Killgore lived. Authorities said Killgore's body was found hours after paramedics were called to a San Diego motel and found Lopez with self-inflicted cuts and a suicide note. Tragic: The body of Brittany Killgore was discovered on Tuesday, four days after she was last seen with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge . Suspect: Authorities believe that the victim knew Jessica Lynn Lopez (pictured here), and the two were involved in some kind of sex slave ring . While authorities would not elaborate on the nature of the relationship between Lopez and the victim, Lopez's neighbor claims she and Mrs Killgore were involved in a dangerous sex ring, playing sex slaves. According to online profiles cited by the San Diego Union-Tribune, Perez and Maraglino were also involved in sadomasochism and bondage. The prosecutor said Lopez and Perez once lived together but didn't indicate when or where. Lopez lives a mile from Killgore's second-floor apartment overlooking Camp Pendleton.It is still unclear how Killgore died. Cory Killgore has not been named as a suspect or person of interest in the killing. The couple married in July of 2010. Lopez's attorney Dean Broyles said he didn't know if his client knew Perez or Mrs Killgore, who was reported missing one day after Lopez turned 25. 'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said. 'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.' Suicide attempt: Jessica Lynn Lopez was found with numerous self-inflicted stab wounds on her body at this Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport . Estranged: Brittany Killgore, right, filed for divorce from husband Cory, left, last week . Lopez's parents, who live in nearby Escondido, released a statement saying they loved their daughter. 'We pray for the family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort them during their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said. 'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.' Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected. A neighbour, who declined to be identified, told ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring. She said: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into.' Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton US Marine base . Perez, 45, had initially pleaded not guilty to stealing a AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton, but was re-arrested on April 24 and charged with Killgore's death. Lopez's bail was set at $3 million. Mrs Killgore went missing shortly after filing for divorce from her husband, Cory Killgore a 22-year-old Marine deployed to Afghanistan. Her body was found in brush in Riverside County about 25 miles northeast of her modest, two-story apartment in Fallbrook, a San Diego County community known for its avocado orchards. Killgore lived a short walk from an entrance to Camp Pendleton, and her complex - like others around it - is full of Marines and their families who tend to be short-term residents and often don't get to know each other well. Fears: Cory, right, is returning from Afghanistan after hearing about the disappearance of his wife, left . Killgore's husband, Lance Corporal Cory Killgore, flew back to California after learning his wife was missing. The couple from Missouri were married in July 2010. Brittany Killgore filed for divorce April 10 and listed 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason. She gave no details on the paperwork. Her cellphone was found in the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego, an area populated with bars and restaurants. Darryl J Wrest of Rolla, Missouri, confirmed Brittany Killgore is his daughter but said he was not commenting on anything at this time. Killgore's other family members also declined to comment. Authorities investigating the homicide said a suicide note of the prime suspect contained key details about the case, including the location of a body. Serious: The Fallbrook scene where Louis Ray Perez is being questioned in connection with the disappearance . Authorities in California are now reportedly examining a possible link between Killgore, the suspect, and a seedy sex ring. ABC 10 reported that officers later responded to a Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport, where they found a woman with stab wounds all over her body in an apparent suicide attempt. That woman, 25-year-old Lopez, was arrested at the scene but hospitalized at UCSD Medical Center. Cory Killgore was deployed to Afghanistan earlier this year as a vehicle operator. Since his wife's murder, Killgore has spoken publicly about her just once, saying in a statement that she was 'beautiful beyond words' and that he was 'devastated' by her loss, according to Patch. 'My duty to her memory is now to ensure her good reputation remains intact, and help law enforcement and prosecutors secure justice for the person or persons who took her away from me,' he said.","Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino invited Brittany Killgore to a dinner cruise on April 13 .

One of the closest friends of Madonna Badger, whose three children and parents perished in a fire at her home on Christmas morning, has revealed how she is coping with the loss. Fashion executive Michelle Kessler-Sanders said Badger, who owned the Stamford, Connecticut property, was being comforted by her close circle of friends from the industry. And she said she was confident Badger will pull through as she comes to terms with the loss of two generations of her family. Friends: Madonna Badger, left, lost her three daughters and both parents in a fire at her Stamford, Connecticut home. Michelle Kessler-Sanders, right, exec for fashion label Vera Wang, said friends are providing support . Mrs Badger barely escaped from the blaze that claimed her parents, Lomer . Johnson, 71, and Pauline, 69, and her three daughters – Lily, 10, . and 7-year-old twins Grace and Sarah. Her boyfriend Michael Borcina, a contractor who was renovating the Victoria house, also survived. 'It's so awful, ' Kessler-Sanders said. 'But here's what I know about Madonna Badger: she is the strongest woman I've ever known in my life, throughout our 20-year friendship. 'I could not handle this myself. But she will find a way to do good things in her life because of this. It will take time, obviously.' In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, the executive vice president and creative director of the Vera Wang Group said she was speaking with the family's permission. She said friends of Badger, 45, were struggling to come to terms with the devastating fire at the Connecticut home. Family: The Johnsons and their grandchildren (L-R) Lily, Grace, Sarah and Morgan - who was not in the house . 'I don't even know how to describe to you how this is for me,' she said. 'For all her friends, it's almost inconceivable. But she has an amazing network of friends who have all shown up. 'That first day after the fire, we were all together. The children's father, Matthew Badger, is going through this in his own way, very privately. 'But there has been an enormous outpouring for Madonna. You can't possibly say anything to comfort a person in this time. You just have to be there and sit with her. Be there so she knows she's not alone. 'She is being cared for by the right people, close friends. She is not alone.' Kessler-Sanders said she learned of the tragedy from a friend. 'I couldn't absorb it,' she says. 'But over the last couple days, you realize - it's epic,' she said. Tragic: Fire officials are unsure whether the property was correctly fitted with activated fire alarms . It comes as Mrs Badger's boyfriend, . Mr Borcina, uttered words of hope before he left the hospital where he . was being treated for smoke inhalation. 'We’re going to be OK,' the contractor, 52, said. 'We’re just trying to stay positive.' Other family members are equally distraught by the tragedy and are trying to make sense of it all. Victims: . Lomer Johnson, 71, his wife Pauline, 69, and their three . granddaughters, Grace, Lily and Sarah (all pictured) perished in a fire . on Christmas morning after fireplace embers caught the house alight . Campbell Badger said his brother . Matthew was devoted to his three daughters and added that the family is . appreciative of the outpouring of public sympathy. ‘Matthew is devastated,’ Mr Badger . told the Associated Press Wednesday. ‘He’s doing as best as can be . expected under the circumstances.’ He said his three nieces were ‘wonderful, delightful energetic children’. ‘They were loved tremendously by their mother and their father, who always put the kids first,’ he said.

Floral bouquets, stuffed animals, and . candles have been left outside the torn-down Victorian home by . passers-by and others wishing to express their condolences. All five victims died of smoke inhalation, the Connecticut medical examiner said Wednesday. Mr Johnson also suffered a blunt head . and neck injury, which could have resulted from a fall, according to . the medical examiner’s office. Generous spirit: Mr Johnson, pictured with his three grandchildren, worked as a department store Santa Claus . All the deaths were ruled accidental. Stamford fire officials said Tuesday that embers in a bag of discarded . fireplace ashes started the fire. The . house should not have even been occupied, fire and city officials have . said, as fire alarms did not appear to have been activated, and the . property did not have an inspection certificate. But . as authorities on Tuesday described the chaotic scene, it emerged two . of the girls were painfully close to safety, but instead turned around . in a moment of panic, becoming trapped in the furious blaze. Led by their mother's boyfriend from . their third-floor bedroom to the second floor, the girls reportedly . bolted back into the flames. Stamford Fire Chief Antonio Conte . said: 'You have to realise with that amount of heat and smoke how scared . those children must have been. They just left him.' Flames quickly entered the house, . spread throughout the first floor and licked upstairs, trapping the . girls. Outside, their mother frantically tried to direct firefighters to . her doomed family, but was unaware her daughters had moved. Bereaved: . Matthew Badger, pictured, lost his three young daughters in a . deadly fire at their mother's Stamford, Connecticut home on Christmas . day. He was in New York City at the time of the tragedy . Two of the girls were found on the . second floor; their other sister died just feet from escaping through a window. Officials at the press conference . could not confirm whether or not the family would have survived if the . home had been fitted with activated smoke alarms. It would depend on the . direction the wind was blowing the smoke, they said. Friend Michelle Kessler-Sanders . They added that investigations are in . the early stages and that Mrs Badger was not in the right state of mind . to answer their questions. Witnesses said Mrs Badger was heard saying: 'My whole life is in there.' Kessler-Sanders . recalled she first met Badger when they worked for Calvin Klein in the . press department. Another colleague was Carolyn Bessette who later . married John Kennedy Jr. She . said: 'Madonna was the art director, she conceived of the whole Marky . Mark/Calvin Klein campaign, which is so iconic. It was an incredible . time at the company. I think even Calvin Klein would say that. 'Madonna . and I stayed very close. I had her baby shower for her first daughter, . Lily. We stayed very close throughout all of our mutual pregnancies. She . had my baby shower for me when my son was born. She was the very first . person who came to the hospital. Aftermath: Investigators examine the roof of the house which collapsed during the deadly fire in Stamford . Trapped: The family of two adults and three children were trapped on the second floor when the fire broke as they slept in their bed at 5am on Christmas morning . 'Although, since she moved to Connecticut, we didn't see each other as much, we remained connected as old friends do.' Family members have also paid tribute to the Johnsons, who would have celebrated their 49th wedding anniversary on Monday.

A suspected homegrown terrorist published a new autobiography online tracing his path from a small town in Alabama where he had enjoyed a 'privileged’ life to a Somali militant group linked to al-Qaida. Omar Hammami, also known as Abu Mansur al-Amriki, said that he is releasing the first part of his autobiography, ‘The Story of an American Jihaadi,’ now due to the ‘unpredictable nature’ of jihad. The text featuring odd spellings and banal observations appeared on Wednesday, two months after Hammami issued a video in which he said he feared for his life because of his disagreements with other members of the al-Qaida group, called al-Shabaab. Wanted: Omar Hammami, also known as Abu Mansur al-Amriki, was born in Alabama, but became radicalized after September 11 and ended up joining a group linked to al-Qaida . In the document, the 28-year-old Hammami describes the actions and deaths of numerous Americans, mostly from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, who also joined with the militant group in Somalia, according to ABC News. ‘Minnesota represented!’ he writes. ‘Those Minnesota brother have almost all left their mark on the [jihad] and most have them received martyrdom; while the rest are still waiting [sic].’ Hammami grew up in Daphne, Alabama. He joined al-Shabab in 2007. Memoir: Hammami published his 127-page autobiography online through an organization called SITE Intelligence . His mother, Debra Hammami, recently told ABC News that even though she does not agree with her son’s ideology, the 127-page memoir was something of a comfort considering that she has not heard from him since he disappeared in 2006 after telling his family he was going to Dubai for work. ‘The silence has been devastating,’ she said. In his memoir, distributed by the SITE Intelligence group, Hammami recounts his arrival in the capital of Somalia and his first meeting with the militants. Hammami describes the training he received, including from one instructor nicknamed ‘The Spy,’ and jokes that the American drones buzzing overhead are ‘racist,’ targeting only 'white' people in Somalia. Throughout, Hammami,  who is wanted by the FBI for his role in militant activities, is unrepentant for his decision to join the jihad and for his calls for violence against the West. Warrior: Hammami moved to Canada in 2002 in hopes of reading 'blacklisted' books, and was embraced by the Somali community there . Looking back on his childhood, the 28-year-old writes that he was 'brought up like most of the children in America.' He celebrated Christmas and birthdays, and went hunting like one of the 'good old boys' on holidays. He points out that, like Apple Corp. founder Steve Jobs, he is the product of a Syrian father - an engineer who moved to the U.S. - and American,  Southern Baptist mother. A religious awakening in his teenage years, he says, led him to don a ‘turban in the Bible Belt post-9/11.’ In 2002, he quit his university studies and moved to Toronto to read 'blacklisted' Islamic books. Recalling his arrival in Canada, Hammami writes: 'There are Tim Horten’s (sic) fast-food joints all over the place and people speak from their nose... We used to have a blast asking the Canadians we met: 'How ’bout that hockey eh? Wanna have a coffee at Tim Horten’s or should I get ya a Fresca?' Fundamentalist: Hammami's friend Daniel Maldonado (pictured) was sentenced in 2007 to ten years in prison for being trained by terrorists . Eventually, however, the 28-year-old jokingly admits that he became addicted to Tim Horton's coffee, according to Metro News. He was welcomed into Toronto’s Somali community after marrying a young woman from it, but he found it had ‘Western defects,’ such as partiality to rap music. Before long, Hammami decided to pursue his dream of becoming a jihadist and moved to Egypt, where he met a fellow fundamentalist from America, Daniel Maldanado, who paved the road to Somalia for him. However, his wife and the mother of his daughter refused to follow him and asked for a divorce. 'I told her that I live under a tree and that I am speaking from a mountain,' he writes. 'She didn’t seem to understand. She refused to come to Somalia and insisted that I should simply come back to Canada and live happily ever after (fat chance!)' Maldonado was later arrested in Kenya and deported to the U.S., where in 2007 he was sentenced to ten years in prison for receiving military training from a terrorist organization. Hammami dates the memoir May 16, 2012, and signs it, 'Still alive and well.' Amended to the book are his answers to questions posed by a journalist. When he is asked if he has any final remarks, Hammami just says, ‘Viva la Revolution!’","Omar Hammami was born in Daphne, Alabama .

Families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing are still angry with the Scottish and British government over the release of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi, a leading senator said yesterday after the terrorist's death. ‘This man was a horrible man,' said New York's Chuck Schumer. 'It would have been better if he’d not died in freedom but died in prison. That’s what he deserved. ‘I still believe that the Scottish government, perhaps with the participation of the British government, created a major injustice when they let him out.’ Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Al-Megrahi (above in 2009) was convicted of being the evil mastermind behind the 1988 plane explosion that killed 270 people . Asked if we will ever know what happened in the bombing, he said: ‘Both the Scottish and British governments have not been forthcoming. ‘The whole deal smelled of a trade for oil for this man’s freedom and that was almost blasphemy given the terrible destruction he caused. ‘I don’t know if we’ll ever get to the bottom of it now’. Frank Duggan, president of Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, which represent the US families who lost loved ones in the disaster, said: ‘Megrahi was shameless, he was unrepentant and chose to go to his death claiming that he had nothing to do with the bombing, which was unbelieveable. Megrahi was the only person convicted in 2001 of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 as it flew to New York from London .

A taxi driver left his neighbour with a four-inch gash after battering him over the head with a wooden pole during a row over damage to a fence. Mohammed Arif, 38, was arrested after launching into Robert Martin at his home in Erdington, Birmingham, last October. The attack followed a long-running dispute over a fence which the neighbours of seven years shared. Attack: Taxi driver Mohammed Arif, pictured, left his neighbour with a four-inch gash after battering him over the head with a wooden pole during a row over damage to a fence . At Birmingham Crown Court today, Arif was handed a 12-month prison sentence - suspended for 18 months - after he admitted unlawful wounding. He was also given a restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Martin and his family. Following the sentencing, Mr Martin spoke of his ordeal. 'I had a four-inch open wound and needed 17 metal staples,' he said. 'I also lost a lot of blood. 'I now get panicky and stressed and suffer from anxiety. 'We just want to move positively forward and live a normal life. We have been through a stressful and troublesome episode in our lives.' Victim: Robert Martin said he gets panicky and stressed and suffers from anxiety following the attack . The court heard how Arif and Mr Martin had been neighbours for seven years, and there had previously been problems over dogs and damage to a fence, with complaints lodged with police on both sides. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said the victim had gone into his garden on October 27 last year to inspect a temporary fence panel he had erected between the two addresses. She said: 'He saw that it had been damaged and had suspicions that the neighbour’s dog had caused the damage.' Mr Martin called Arif out of his home and the two then argued about the damage. The row culminated in Arif, who had been shouting and swearing, attacking his neighbour with a stick, causing a wound to his head, which had to be treated in hospital. Sunit Sandhu, defending, said 'It was a loss of control on the day and out of character.' He said that Arif, who had a large family, intended to leave the address and regarded what he did as an 'act of stupidity'. Arif was also ordered to do 150 hours’ unpaid work and pay £150 compensation. Judge Paul Cullum said he accepted he had not intended to cause the degree of harm that he did and that his conviction meant he would lose his job. He said: 'Overall, this was an unpleasant incident when you lost your temper. You delivered one blow with a weapon.'","Mohammed Arif, 38, was arrested after launching into his neighbour of seven years Robert Martin .

Far from enjoying the quiet of the countryside, what farmyard animals really want to hear is a good rock song from the likes of Aerosmith and Bon Jovi - preferably on Radio 2. A survey carried out by RSPCA Freedom Food showed 77 per cent of farmers in the east of . England play music or sing to their livestock, tipping Radio 2 as the . most popular radio station for animals, followed by Radio 1. Among the artists to have found a new fan base in pigs and cows are Adele, Bon Jovi, Coldplay and Eminem, according to farmers. Farmers have said livestock enjoy listening to rock music, preferably on Radio 2 . They also admitted to singing hymns, rugby songs and piggy nursery rhymes to keep their animals relaxed. But it isn't just the sound of music that puts the farm animals in a good mood. The research found livestock also . enjoyed keeping up to date with  current affairs and sport from Radio Five Live and Radio Four's Today . programme. It follows research from Writtle College in . Essex which found that playing background music can have a positive . effect on sows and piglets by increasing suckling and making mothers more . playful. Bon Jovi is a top choice to keep animals happy . Mark Hayward of Dingley Dell Pork in Woodbridge, Suffolk, has taken the theory one step further and has his own house band the Broadside Boys. He said: 'We often sit on the hay bales, singing and strumming to our Freedom Food pigs and I’m convinced they love it. 'And when the bands not playing we have music on all the time, coming from the tractors or my truck. 'It’s really important to be relaxed and calm around farm animals because they respond to your mood and in turn become more chilled out too. 'Music and also talking to our animals is a key part of that. I chat away to my breeding sows all the time, although the piglets are often too busy to stay still long enough to listen.' The survey found that more than half of farmers, 59 per cent, talk to their animals with hot topics including the weather and how they are feeling. Tracks by Coldplay also proved to be a hit among the herds . RSPCA farm animal scientist, Dr Marc . Cooper, said: 'Chatting to farm animals may sound daft but there is a . clear welfare message behind Freedom Food’s survey.

The figure is 4,000 more than the number who currently serve in Afghanistan and will see bomb disposal experts, specialist sniffer dog handlers, building search teams and regular soldiers will support the police to keep the 2012 Games safe. The Ministry of Defence added that snipers in Lynx and Puma helicopters will patrol the skies of London. Typhoon jets will move to RAF Northolt in west London from bases in Scotland and Lincolnshire so they can be scrambled to the Olympic site within minutes.

A bungling burglar who stole £700 of drugs left his address in a bag near the pharmacy he plundered. Idiotic Darren Henderson, 31, had only been out of prison for a day when he raided the chemist's in Norwich.

James Landles, defending, said Henderson had been freed from prison just the day before and he had burgled the pharmacy to get drugs. Mr Landles told JPs: 'The root cause of this is his desire to escape from living in the real world. 'He came out of prison still on class A drugs. He was at a low ebb.' He added: 'He was desperate. He had been released with nothing to go to - nobody for support.' The case was adjourned to Norwich Magistrates' Court for sentencing for two weeks while reports are prepared.
