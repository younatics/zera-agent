"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Nearly one per cent of young women who have become pregnant claim to have done so as virgins . Nearly one per cent of young women who have become pregnant claim to have done so as virgins, an American study has found. Researchers interviewed 7,870 women aged 15 to 28 and found that more than 0.5 per cent of them who said they were virgins had also given birth - without the help of IVF. The women were part of the . long-running National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,  according to a report in the Christmas edition of the BMJ. The girls were 12 to 18 years old when they entered the study in the . 1994-95 school year and were interviewed periodically about their health . and behaviour over 14 years. Based on interviews with the women, 45 of the . 5,340 pregnancies in this group through the years occurred in women who reported that they conceived without a man being involved. Lead researcher Amy Herring and her colleagues devised an experiment where subjects were . able to reply candidly to  computer-generated self-interviews. While the women weren't specifically asked about virgin births, the researchers used their replies to make a rough timeline of when the women started having sex and when they became pregnant. The average age at which 'virgins' reportedly gave birth was 19.3 . years. Of the 45 women who became pregnant despite claiming to be virgins, 31 per cent said they had signed chastity pledges. Only 15 per cent of non-virgins said they had signed a the pledge - promising to not have sex before marriage. The 45 self-described virgins who reported having become pregnant (and . the 36 who gave birth) were also more likely than non-virgins to say their . parents never or rarely talked to them about sex and birth control. About 28 per cent of the 'virgin' mothers' parents (who were also . interviewed) indicated they didn't have enough knowledge to discuss sex . and contraception with their daughters, and were less  likely to know how to use condoms. While the 'virgin' mothers in question were more likely to have boys than girls, and to be pregnant during the weeks leading up to Christmas, neither similarity to the Virgin Mary was statistically significant . The researchers, from the . University of North Carolina, say such scientifically impossible claims show researchers must use care in interpreting self-reported behaviour. The researchers found that although the mothers in question were . more likely to have boys than girls, and to be pregnant during the weeks . leading up to Christmas, neither similarity to the Virgin Mary was . statistically significant. Virgin births in animals generally occur by asexual . reproduction, and have been documented in multiple animals including pit . vipers, boa constrictors, sharks, and Komodo dragons.

The idea of coming out to your parents or loved ones by way of a digitalised recorded message from David Hasselhoff may seem the pinnacle of bizarre, but that is precisely what makers of a new app propose. Celebrity Video Messages has 40 celebrities on its books, including David Hasselhoff, Shane Richie, Sinitta, and Warwick Davis, who will record bespoke, personalised messages for anyone for a modest fee (from £10-100). The makers say they expect most of the messages will be for things like Happy Birthday, Get Well Soon, Good luck on your exams, or the occasional proposal of marriage. Sign up to get The Hoff, left, to tell your folks something you can't face doing yourself, or maybe choose Sinitta, right, instead . Website Celebrity Video Messages has 40 celebrities on their books personalized messages for anyone for a modest fee . However they also envisage the app will be used to convey other messages. As well as being use by people who want to come out about their sexuality, the app could be used to heal a family rift (for who could resist the wisdom of the Hoff) or to encourage a dieter on their weight loss journey. In fact any of the 40 celebrities will say anything you wish for a set price. But not all celebrities are created equal, and a few seconds of talk from David Hasselhoff will set you back $100 (or about £70), while a message from Simon Cowel’s ex Sinitta is a bargain at just £15, while former Hear Say singer Suzanne Shaw is a rather specific £27.50. Just $100, or about £70 can buy you the Hoff on a screen, for a few seconds . Actor and singer Shane Ritchie is just one of the 40 or so celebrities who have already signed up to the website .

Once you have paid, you simply say what message you want recording and the video will be sent to you in between ‘a few days to a few weeks’. However, if your chosen celebrity has gone all diva and is taking too long to record your message, you can cancel your request and get your money back.

"By . Beth Stebner . Updated: . 18:14 EST, 15 December 2011 . Sirhan Sirhan, the man convicted for the assassination of Senator and presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy, is appealing his sentence of life in prison, claiming that he is innocent. He has repeatedly protested his innocence and requested parole, with his most recent request denied in March. Sirhan’s lawyers, William Pepper and Laurie Dusek, are using a defence that is eerily familiar to another Kennedy murder - that there was more than one shooter. They say the 67-year-old Christian Palestinian born in Jerusalem was hypno-programmed to divert attention from a shooter who actually killed Mr Kennedy in 1968. They also allege he was an easy scapegoat because he is Arab. Seeking reprieve: Jordan-native Sirhan Sirhan (pictured after the 1968 shooting) claims he did not shoot Senator Robert F Kennedy . The attorneys cite an expert analysis of ‘new evidence’ that shows two guns were fired on the night Mr Kennedy was assassinated in the former Ambassador Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. According to court papers, Sirhan has stronger eyewitness evidence, along with ‘scientific, forensic evidence which cannot be credibly refuted’ that was not available during his 1969 trial. Someone get help: Senator Kennedy was shot in the kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel . The attorneys allege that fraud was . committed during the trial when the court counted an ancillary bullet as . evidence for a bullet that was retrieved from Mr Kennedy’s neck. Mr Pepper says the substitute bullet had been matched to others from Sirhan’s weapon. Mind control and hypno-programming . are serious and real and have been used for decades by the CIA, U.S. military and other covert operations, Mr Pepper and Mrs Dusek say in the . federal court papers, which were filed earlier this week. ‘The . public has been shielded from the darker side of the practice. The . average person is unaware that hypnosis can and is used to induct . antisocial conduct in humans,’ the court papers say. They . attest to Sirhan’s innocence, saying: ‘[Sirhan] was an involuntary . participant in the crimes being committed because he was subjected to . sophisticated hypno-programing and memory implantation techniques which . rendered him unable to consciously control his thoughts and actions at . the time the crimes were being committed.’ Mr Pepper told CNN that new examination of audio from that fateful June night ‘clearly showed that 13 shots were fired in the pantry, and Sirhan’s gun had only eight shots, so it definitely means there was a second shooter.’ The once and future president: Senator Kennedy had won the California Primaries and was just addressing a cheering crowd of supporters when he was shot . In custody: Sirhan Sirhan was arrested at the hotel after the shooting. His attorneys claim there was more than one shooter at the Ambassador . An analysis of a recently recovered audiotape recorded by a freelance journalist gives Sirhan’s attorneys new fuel for their case. Mourning: Bobby Kennedy's wife and son follow Kennedy's coffin at his funeral in Washington . The tape – discovered by CNN’s Brad . Johnson – has the only known audio recording of the shots fired at . Robert Kennedy, recorded from 40 feet away from the shooting. Two experts independently verified that more than eight shots were captured on the tape. One of the analysts, Phillip Van Praag, says the shots were too close together to have all come from Sirhan’s handgun. Nor would Sirhan have had time to reload in the amount of time the shots were fired, Mr Van Praag says. Robert’s death, much like his brother John’s, is shrouded in mystery and a never-ending list of conspiracy theories that popularly involve multiple shooters and government plots. Sirhan is serving a life sentence at . Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, California after he was . convicted of killing Mr Kennedy and wounding five others during the June . 5, 1968 shooting in the pantry of the glamorous Ambassador Hotel. Mr . Kennedy, having just delivered a short speech after winning . California’s Primary Election, was ushered through a kitchen pantry en . route to a room where reporters were waiting for a press conference. Shots rang out– three bullets struck Mr Kennedy, and a fourth grazed his suit coat. He died the next day in the nearby Good Samaritan hospital. Sirhan was arrested at the scene and indicted for murder. After the 1969 trial, he was convicted to death, a sentence that was overturned in 1972 in exchange for life in prison. He has repeatedly been seeking parole - and denied it - since 1983.

"By . Cindy Tran for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . South African cricketer Dale Steyn admits he hasn’t yet forgiven the Australian skipper Michael Clarke after their heated on-field spat during the Cape Town Test. Lifting the lid on the lingering bad blood between the pair, Steyn intimated he's never been more deeply offended by a personal sledge made by Clarke in the final moments of Australia's bitter series victory back in March. Clarke claims he apologised to Steyn immediately after the match and admits he was 'out of line' for overstepping the mark during a post-match press conference. South African cricketer Dale Steyn admits he hasn't yet forgiven the Australian skipper Michael Clarke after a heated on-field exchange during the Cape Town Test in March . But Steyn clearly hasn't accepted Clarke's remorse as genuine. South Africa and Australia stayed at the same hotel in Harare during the one-day tri-series, but the pair never spoke one word to each other before Clarke returned home through injury, missing Saturday's final won convincingly by South Africa. Steyn didn't mince words about his attitude towards Clarke since the explosive incident and what it would take to bury the hatchet. 'I don't take many things personally, but what he did say to me I did take personally,' Steyn said after claiming man-of-the-match honours in the tri-series final win in Harare on Saturday. 'I know he apologised in the media and I should be playing this down. 'But the day he comes and shakes my hand and says 'I really mean what I said' and behaves like the way he should, maybe then I will (forgive him). 'But for right now, he's not here so I'll wait until I get to Australia.' Steyn intimated he's never been more deeply offended by a personal sledge made by Clarke in the final moments of Australia's bitter series victory back in March . Clarke and Mitchell Johnson of Australia consult the umpire after a review decision for the wicket of Vernon Philander of South Africa during day 5 of the third test match between South Africa and Australia at Sahara Park Newlands in Cape Town . Clarke claims he apologised to Steyn immediately after the match and admits he was 'out of line' for overstepping the mark but Steyn clearly hasn't accepted it . Steyn's comments sets up another heated battle when South Africa tour Australia for more limited overs matches in November. Especially given Clarke feels he's already adequately apologised for the incident which occurred while Steyn was batting desperately to try save the Test. The Australian skipper intervened while Steyn was having words with James Pattinson, prompting the Proteas star to blow up in response - although the exact nature of Clarke's sledge is unknown. Clarke claimed before leaving Harare that he believed he had set the record straight with Steyn. 'I would hope Dale and I have a good enough relationship. I'm pretty sure he would front me if he still had an issue with me,' he said nine days ago. 'I think my apology at the time was well taken and respected by Dale.' Steyn's comments sets up another heated battle when South Africa tour Australia for more limited overs matches in November . Clarke returned to Sydney on Tuesday from the team's one-day series in Zimbabwe, after aggravating a hamstring injury . Clarke said he didn't believe the two teams had fallen out, but also conceded Australia wouldn't be losing any sleep if South Africa were holding grudges. 'If no player in their team wants to talk to anybody in our team I don't think it's going to bother anyone,' Clarke said. 'But I would like to think there's always that play hard on the field but off the field have a beer (attitude).' The teams did share a drink after Saturday's ODI final, and Australian coach Darren Lehmann says he wasn't aware of an ongoing issue. But chief antagonists from the Test series Clarke and David Warner weren't present and from the Proteas' perspective, relations are at an all-time low between the teams off the field. Only one South African player, Alviro Petersen, ventured into the Australian sheds for a customary post-match beer after the Test series.","South African cricketer Dale Steyn admits he hasn’t yet forgiven the Australian skipper Michael Clarke after their heated on-field dispute .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline . A Chinese farmer left with a large chunk missing from his skull is to have it repaired with the help of a 3D printer. The man, known only as 46-year-old Hu, was injured after falling from the third floor of his home in Xi'an, Shaanxi province. Doctors are now planning to re-build his skull with a titanium mesh created by a 3D printer. The man, known only as 46-year-old Hu, was injured after falling from the third floor of his home in Xi'an . Doctors are now planning to re-build his skull with a titanium mesh created by a 3D printer . The custom-made implant will be inserted under Hu's skin and attached to his skull. If the procedure is successful, doctors say the mesh will restore the original shape of his head. Last week surgeons in China successfully implanted an artificial 3D-printed vertebra into a 12-year-old bone cancer patient to help him walk again. Doctors at Peking University Hospital in Beijing first removed a tumour located in the second vertebra of the boy's neck. They then replaced it with the 3D-printed implant between the first and third vertebrae to allow him to lift his head. The five-hour surgery was a world first and will enable the boy named Minghao to walk again after spending two months confined to a hospital bed. While 3D-printed organs are not yet commonly used, there have been previous cases of patients being implanted with 3D-printed jaws, hips and even a pelvis. 'This is the first use of a 3D-printed vertebra as an implant for orthopaedic spine surgery in the world,' Dr Liu Zhongjun, who performed the surgery, told Chinese media CCTV. The custom-made implant will be inserted under Hu's skin and attached to his skull. If the procedure is successful, doctors say the titanium mesh will restore the original shape of his head. Using existing technology, the patient's head needs to be framed with pins after surgery. The patient's head cannot touch the bed when he is resting. This lasts for at least three months,' Dr Liu said. 'But with 3D printing technology, we can simulate the shape of the vertebra, which is much stronger and more convenient than traditional methods,' said Dr Liu Zhongjun, who performed the surgery . And last year, British surgeons used 3D printing technology to recreate the severely injured face of a road accident victim. The unaffected side of the biker’s face was used to create a mirror image, to enable perfect facial reconstruction. The images are were both to design guides to cut and position facial bones with pinpoint accuracy and create tailor-made implants for the patient. The guides and implants were produced in medical-grade titanium in Belgium, at one of the world’s few specialist 3D printing facilities.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Armed with a small GPS device and some hacking tools, the spy sneaks from house to house, tapping into vulnerable Wi-Fi systems and exposing networks that can be accessed with ease. But this isn’t a human testing out the security capabilities of homes; rather, it’s a cat fitted with a gadget around its neck to see if pets could hack into Wi-Fi networks. It might sound far-fetched, but it’s a scenario that was played out recently by one security expert, and while its slightly tongue-in-cheek he says that cats could indeed be used as mobile hackers, highlighting unsecure networks in a neighbourhood. Gene Bransfield in Virginia used a siamese cat (stock image shown) called Coco to hack into his neighbours' networks. The pet was fitted with a device around its collar to seek out vulnerable Wi-Fi. The device included a GPS device and hacking tools and cost less than £60 ($100) Google has unveiled an elite squad of hackers tasked with scouring the internet for security holes and defending the public against cyberattacks. Unveiled as 'Project Zero' the team will hunt for bugs in the world's most popular software, such as Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. 'You should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state-sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer, steal secrets or monitor your communications,' Google security researcher Chris Evans said in a blog post. Yet he said sophisticated attacks continue to target, for instance, human rights activists and businesses. 'This needs to stop. We think more can be done to tackle this problem. 'We're hiring the best practically-minded security researchers and contributing 100 per cent of their time toward improving security across the internet.' At the Def Con 22 Hacking conference this weekend in Las Vegas, Tenacity Solutions Principle Security Engineer Gene Bransfield will present a rather unusual bit of research. Titled ‘Weaponising your pets: The War Kitteh and the Denial of Service Dog,’ Bransfield’s presentation will explain how he used a cat and tracking collar to hack into Wi-Fi networks. 'The collar contained a GPS device and a cellular component and would track your cats movements throughout the neighbourhood,’ Bransfield explains on the Def Con website. He also explains that, if the owner gets nervous that the cat might get caught, the GPS device can be used to find the cat and retrieve it. According to Wired the method used was something called ‘wardriving’, which involves scouring multiple networks to see how secure they are. Usually one might expect a hacker to drive round in a car and search for networks and see which were vulnerable. But Bransfield’s method instead fitted a cat with a digital collar and used it as a smaller ‘wardriving’ agent, something that he has dubbed ‘WarKitteh’. Bransfield will present his findings at the Def Con 22 hacking conference in Las Vegas this weekend. He says that he had no malicious intent but it is does highlight that some people should update their home security settings. Pictured is a team competing in Def Con 17 on 1 August 2009 . The device strapped around the cat’s neck cost less than £60 ($100) and looked for an older form of wireless encryption that can be easily broken, known as WEP. The modern WPA encryption, meanwhile, is more secure. Using a friend’s cat called Coco, he was able to find 23 Wi-Fi hotspots and more than a third of them used WEP encryption and thus could be hacked into. While he insists his research was solely for fun and not with any malicious intent, he explains that anyone could mimic his device with relative ease. And the method goes to show that if even a cat can break into someone's weak home Wi-Fi network, they should perhaps consider upgrading their security to make it less accessible to hackers.","Gene Bransfield in Virginia used a cat to hack into his neighbours' networks .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . The parents of two step-brothers have spoken of their heartache that both boys are suffering the same muscle-wasting condition. Cameron McKenzie, eight, and Ben Stewart, nine, are unlikely to survive beyond their teenage years after being told they are both suffering Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The condition has left Cameron largely confined to his wheelchair, while the same fate is expected to befall his step-brother Ben in the near future. Step brothers Cameron McKenzie, left, and Ben Stewart, right, both suffer the rare muscle-wasting condition Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and are not expected to live beyond their teenage years . The condition has left Cameron largely confined to his wheelchair, while the boys' parents Sheryl and Alan Stewart said the same fate is expected to befall Ben in the near future . The brothers, who are also best friends, were both diagnosed as toddlers, but only met four years ago when their parents rekindled a romantic teenage relationship . Around one in 3,500 boys in the UK are born with DMD, but two unrelated brothers having the condition is simply a very unlucky chance association, London-based genetics specialist Dr Anand Saggar, told MailOnline. In the face of their bleak prognosis, the inspiring pair, from Stoneyburn, West Lothian in Scotland, have compiled a bucket list of dreams they aim to complete before their time runs out. Meeting comedian Harry Hill, the cast of Top Gear, a dream holiday to Australia and spending Christmas with Mickey Mouse, all feature on the boys' list. The pair's parents Sheryl and Alan Stewart, both 35, and their sisters Phoebe, six and Layla, two, are helping the boys achieve their dreams before their bodies begin to fail them. Mrs Stewart, who has now become a full-time carer for the brothers, said: 'What's important is fulfilling their dreams and having no regrets. 'If the worst happens sooner rather than later, we want to know we've done everything we could to make their dreams come true. 'The boys have got such a special bond, they would literally do anything for each other. It's good that they've both got each other. 'They're getting a wee bit older and Cameron is deteriorating earlier than we thought - we don't think he'll go another year walking - so now is the time. 'The only thing we are going to be left with when they are gone is memories and photos so it means everything to us.' Ben and Cameron were both diagnosed as toddlers, but only met four years ago when their parents rekindled a romantic teenage relationship. Mr and Mrs Stewart were childhood sweethearts almost 20 years ago, but the love affair waned - until they met years later. Fate brought them back together and they discovered that both their children were suffering from the same illness. They tied the knot in 2011, which made Cameron and Ben step-brothers and the best of friends. Ben and Cameron have compiled a bucket list of adventures they want to complete before their bodies become too affected by their condition . Mrs Stewart, who has now become a full-time carer for the brothers, said: 'What's important is fulfilling their dreams and having no regrets. If the worst happens sooner rather than later, we want to know we've done everything we could to make their dreams come true' Both boys have been on steroids to help keep them mobile for longer, but the side-effects were so severe the family felt there was no alternative but to stop. The drug withdrawal has accelerated their decline . Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a neuromuscular condition caused by a lack of protein called dystrophin. Around 100 boys with the serious condition, which causes progressive muscle weakness, are born in the UK each year. It is a genetic condition and can be inherited. The condition starts early in childhood and maybe detected when noticing a child has difficulty standing up. Children with DMD will struggle to walk, climb and run. The condition causes muscles throughout the body to weaken and waste, including those of the . heart and chest. Around one in 3,500 boys in the UK are born with DMD. Symptoms of the condition include: . Source: Muscular Dystrophy Campaign . Mrs Stewart said: 'It's so rare to even know someone who has a child with DMD, for it to happen to both of us, it's unbelievable. 'It's a one in a million chance that this would happen.' The family have now managed to get financial support from the Fund a Wish Foundation, which will go towards an adventure trip to Lapland in early December. But the pressure is on to get Ben and Cameron to meet their TV idols and their favourite animals in Australia, before their condition deteriorates. Both boys had been on steroids, to help keep them mobile for longer, but the side-effects were so severe the family felt there was no alternative but to stop. The drug withdrawal has accelerated the decline of Cameron's health and he is now showing signs of curvature of the spine - which could crush his lungs and heart. 'We really need to do the bucket list items before they need the respirators, the ventilators, before they need the feeding tubes and things like that,' said Mrs Stewart. 'We're desperate not to leave it too late because we want Cameron to be able to walk at least some parts of it.' Mr Stewart, who works as a graphic designer, added: 'We are on a limited time scale of what the boys can do before their condition deteriorates. 'We have hard times ahead, so we made a conscious decision to make their dreams come true. It won't be easy, but it would mean the world to us.'

Speaking in his first ever television interview, Perumal has revealed that he made around £3million from rigging football matches around the world and claims that he would sometimes sit on team benches giving orders to players and coaches. He told CNN: ‘I never really counted, but I think it should be between 80 and 100 football matches. VIDEO Scroll down for Director of Sport Integrity: Battle against match-fixing is winnable . Fixer: Wilson Maj Perumal (pictured) claims that he rigged around 100 football matches and made £3million . ‘I was on the bench at times, and telling players what to do, giving orders to the coach. It was that easy. There was no policing whatsoever.’ Perumal said that when he was younger he had dreamed of a career in the armed forces. He added: ‘I had my boyhood dreams. I wanted to be a soldier but during my school days I got a criminal record and couldn't really pursue what I wanted to. And then I got attracted to betting when I was about 19-20 years old. ‘I kind of got hooked and I didn't want to lose… so I started fixing local matches.’ The 49-year-old began fixing matches in the late 1980s in Singapore and eventually joined what international police organization Interpol described as 'the world's most notorious match-fixing syndicate'. He boasted that his success rate was about 70 to 80 per cent. Astonishingly, some football associations welcomed him ‘with open arms’, he explained.

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Being known as one of the game's greatest AFL players would mean nothing to Adam Goodes if it's the only memory people have of him, the star has revealed. In light of last week's social media war with Shane Warne - which touched on Goodes' Australian of The Year title - the Sydney Swan has opened-up about life as and indigenous ambassador to Aboriginal people and the 'legacy' of being a father. Speaking about life other than football, the premiership-winning captain said being an Aboriginal person doesn't stop when you win Australian of The Year and that his greatest hope from a career in AFL is not to create history on the field, but off it. Scroll down for video . Adam Goodes wants to be known for more than just his on-field attributes when he retires . Some punters on Twitter attacked Warne (left) for not knowing about Goodes' title (right) Goodes was the 2014 Australian Of The Year . In a one-on-one interview the star has revealed that should he not be remembered for reasons other than AFL, then he hasn't achieved his life aims. 'If people only remember me for my football...I've failed at life,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'I live by that quote.' Goodes was borrowing a similar belief from a 1980s basketball player, former Detroit Piston guard Isiah Thomas, who was an African American player. 'He uses basketball,' Goodes said. 'I change it to football.' 'If I'm only defined by my sport, I really have failed.' His other legacy, he said, is his children. And while he said he isn't even married yet there will be a time when he looks forward to bringing them into his life. On Shane Warne and the controversial Twitter admission he made during an AFL match where the leg spinner said he was 'shocked' he won the Australian Of The Year honour, Goodes said: . 'My argument has always been, 'I didn't nominate me...I don't have a vote on the Australia Day council, it's their choice.' Former test Cricketer Adam Gilchrist who is a member of the Australian Day council said Shane Warne is entitled to his opinion on both the AFL player and the Australian of The Year winner, but stopped at saying Warne was 'racist'. 'Some have misconstrued Warnie's comments as racist. People have got wildly out of control if they think that.' During an AFL game on Saturday Former Australian cricketer Shane Warne made a bizarre admission on Twitter that he didn't know Swans star Adam Goodes was Australian of the Year . Goodes hit back on Sunday morning mentioning Warne's former teammate and fellow cricketer Adam Gilchrist . The comments where made during an AFL match between the Sydney Swans and Richmond Tigers on Saturday evening. Warne accused Swans star Adam Goodes of staging, or taking theatrical dives in order to earn free kicks during the game. 'Come on tigers beat those Swans and make the finals. By the way, does everyone get annoyed when Adam Goodes always ""stages"" for free kicks ?' Warne wrote. It was soon after he said he was shocked to learn of Goodes January award: 'I think Syd or the Hawks will win the flag. Shocked as I just found out Goodes was Aust of the year, wow ! Who votes for that?' Warne wrote in a bizarre tweet. Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke said called Swans star Goodes a 'legend' during the exchange . What followed was many puzzled punters asking what he meant by his comments, while other users were astounded he missed the news. One wrote to Warne 'So much respect gone for you. Use to like you but you're actually a flog. Can't believe I looked up to you as a kid.' Others joked that they thought the former cricketer's account to be a parody based on his recent comments, only to discover it wasn't. On Sunday morning Adam Goodes responded to the exchange as he pointed out that Australian cricketer and one of Warne's former teammates Adam Gilchrist, is the head of the Australia Day Council. Michael Clarke also responded that Shane Warne could be the next Australian of the Year . '@ShaneWarne thanks for your support mate maybe ask @gilly381 who votes for it he is the chair of the Australia Day Council'. Goodes wrote. Warne then repeated his initial advice for Goodes to stop diving, and wished the Swans star luck for the upcoming finals. '@adamroy37 Just stop staging for free kicks mate. You should be better than that as Aust of the year !!! Good luck in the finals', Warne tweeted. Some twitter users threw their support behind Warne over the strange sentiments, while many other people were astounded by the comments made by the former cricketer. One user commended Goodes on his response and wrote: 'Well done Adam, so tired of ppl (people) undermining your achievements'. Warne ended the conversation with the same comment he began it with - about staging during the match .","The Sydney Swan says his AFL career would mean nothing if not used for the betterment of Aboriginal people .

"By . Martin Robinson . Business success: Nicky Blair, the football agent son of Tony Blair, is understood to have secured a record fee for a Mexican star this summer . He has some way to go before  he matches his father’s multi- million-pound fortune. But Nicky Blair certainly seems to be heading in the right direction. After setting himself up as a football agent, Tony Blair’s middle son has reportedly struck his first big deal – collecting 10 per cent from a £6.7million transfer. Nicky, 27, apparently helped negotiate the big-money move of Mexican Hector Herrera to top European side FC Porto in June. But that record transfer for a Mexican player may be dwarfed if his compatriot Marco Fabian, who is also represented by Nicky, is snapped up by Premier League or European clubs next year for a reputed £10million. Nicky was once thought to want to follow his father into politics. But unlike older brother Euan, 29, who is tipped to stand for Parliament, Nicky left Oxford, where he studied modern history, and taught at an inner-city school in the West Midlands for two years. He and his university friend Gabriel Moraes then launched themselves into the lucrative field of football agencies. Last year he was sharing a desk in his mother Cherie’s London law practice but his Magnitude agency has reportedly become so successful that it now has offices in Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City. Star player: FC Porto's £6.7million Mexican midfielder Hector Herrera runs with the ball last week, and moved to the European giant in a deal secured by young Blair . His success makes him a chip off the old block. Tony Blair makes millions of pounds a year advising governments and international firms, and is said to be worth £60million to £80million. He is notoriously secretive about his wealth, with most of his earnings since he left office in 2007 hidden in a network of private firms. However he is believed to have paid for the a four-storey, £1.35million Georgian townhouse in central London where Nicky lives. Nicky's mother was a director of  Magnitude Limited until May, owning 20 per cent, and allows her son to use a desk at her business in central London. Supportive: Nicky, pictured left with his siblings Kathryn and Euan, has had help from his parents, including mother Cherie, who is a director of his company and on one occasion helped court a young star on his behalf . EUAN BLAIR: Euan is the eldest Blair child and is the only one with obvious political ambitions. The Labour seat of Coventry North West could become vacant as current MP Geoffrey Robinson may retire in 2015, and the 29-year-old is thought to be keen. He is currently chief commercial officer for recruitment agency Sarina Russo Job Access. Last month he married his long-term girlfriend Suzanne Ashman, 25, in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire. KATHRYN BLAIR: 25-year-old Kathryn was called to the Bar last year by Lincoln’s Inn – the same inn of court her parents Tony and Cherie joined in the 1970s. The young barrister has a boyfriend and lives in £975,000 home her father bought her in 2010, near his own central London property. LEO BLAIR: 13-year-old Leo is the youngest child, and known to be musically-gifted, currently appearing in the English National Opera's production of The Magic Flute . The schoolboy is playing 'Spirit', and made his West End debut in the chorus of Bizet’s Carmen last year. In 2000 he was the first child born to a serving Prime Minister for 150 years, and was named after Tony Blair's late father. Mrs Blair had even taken major steps to help Nicky secure top players in the Americas. In 2011 she took time out of her busy international schedule to meet an unknown Mexican footballer. A car collected then 17-year-old soccer prodigy Raul Mendiola from his family’s rundown trailer-park home in a Spanish-speaking suburb of Los Angeles and took him to the plush hotel where the wife of the ex-Prime Minister was staying. She spent time chatting to the footballer before posing for a photograph with him. Just days later, in an apparent attempt to cement confidence in her son’s business, Raul’s mother Claudia Velador received a picture of a smartly dressed Mr and Mrs Blair, personally signed with the words ‘Thank you’. But it emerged that Raul had no idea he had entrusted his future to a man whose parents are on first-name terms with the world’s most powerful people. Speaking from her home in San Bernardino, California, Claudia said: ‘Raul didn’t have a clue he was dealing with a former Prime Minister’s son'. He now plays for David Beckham's former side LA Galaxy. Nicky gave up being a school teacher to set up the company with Oxford University friend Gabriel Moraes. However, it emerged earlier this year that the business was loss-making and was to be dissolved and restructured. But the Herrera transfer may have made . all the difference to the company and Nicky is now said to be looking . to expand into the Middle East.

"By . Jonathan McEvoy for the Daily Mail . Lewis Hamilton, his bling twinkling in the flash bulbs, summoned the Mercedes PR man to hand him his phone. Quick, Jeeves. Hamilton turned round to take a ‘selfie’ with the pre-Italian Grand Prix press conference throng, adopting the nonchalant air of a man without a care. Nico Rosberg sat on the other side of the front row, his arms firmly folded. Fernando Alonso was sandwiched between them — just in case. VIDEO Scroll down for Lewis Hamilton previews the Italian Grand Prix . Trio: Ferrari's Fernando Alonso sat between feuding team-mates Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton . This was the first time we had seen Hamilton and Rosberg in such close proximity since they tangled at the Belgian Grand Prix a fortnight ago, and the body language yesterday was more instructive than their answers, which were often vague, coded or plain evasive. Hamilton, it seemed, enjoyed holding the psychological edge over his title rival who has apologised for the crash, paid a six-figure fine to his Mercedes team for causing it and been reduced in the estimation of many for his perceived utter ruthlessness. It was an all the more welcome feeling for Hamilton because he has lost virtually every mind-game of the season to the usually ice-veined Rosberg, who leads him at the top of the standings by 29 points. Spa break: The two drivers came together in Belgium, Rosberg admitted the crash was his error . Momentum, mechanical luck and championship points have all drained away from the British driver since he won in Spain in mid-May, when Mercedes chairman Niki Lauda proved himself to be the anti-Nostradamus by hailing Hamilton as ‘unbeatable’. Since the Spa fracas, there has been a frank meeting of the squabbling protagonists and the Mercedes management at the team’s Brackley factory. But a truce is not a peace. As if to prove all is not right, a smile played across each of their lips at a point when the other was in a slight fix. It was Rosberg’s turn when Hamilton was asked if he had been penalised for ignoring a team order to let the German through during the previous race in Hungary. Rivals: The pair have endured a tense relationship all season, but it has deteriorated in recent months . He took an age to answer. ‘Um…well, I don’t really know,’ he finally ventured. ‘We always get a big slap on the wrist.’ Mercedes later said Hamilton was not fined, but the matter was discussed. Hamilton’s moment to smirk came when he was asked if the FIA should have investigated the crash at Spa? ‘I think it’s a really good question,’ he said. ‘I don’t know the full answer to that really.’ Again and again we were left to decipher the code. Hamilton was asked if trust had been restored. ‘Trust is a big word and it’s not something I would particularly apply to racing,’ he said. ‘Naturally, Nico and I have been racing for a long time and I think we set a good foundation a long, long time ago.’ Drivers' standings: Rosberg is currently leading the championship, while team-mate Hamilton is second . Decoded that reads: ‘I don’t trust him an inch. I have known him and his knavish tricks since we were boys.’ Did Hamilton now see the crash as nothing more than a racing incident? ‘What has happened in the past is in the past.’ Decoded: ‘No, he meant to do it and has had his comeuppance.’ Although some Hamilton fans will be horrified by the suggestion, it was a minor incident brought about by the two men racing hard. Rosberg pushed an inch or two too far. Little more. He certainly did not deserve boos on the podium in Spa. ‘It was not a nice feeling,’ said the German. ‘I understand because they travelled a long way to watch a big battle between Lewis and me, and they didn’t get that. I accept that.’ Time was called after half an hour. Rosberg, last out of the room, gave Hamilton plenty of space as they left.

Brawn was an integral cog in the Ferrari winning machine at the turn of the century which saw Michael Schumacher storm to five consecutive Formula One titles. But the Italian team are now 26 races without a victory - their longest winless streak in almost two decades - and only 10 points ahead of Williams in the battle for third in this year’s constructors’ championship. Glory days: Ross Brawn (right) was at Ferrari when Michael Schumacher dominated Formula One . Earlier this year, the likeable Stefano Domenicali resigned as team principal and was replaced by little-known Marco Mattiacci; a move which, on the face of it, appeared as a short-term fill, prompting suggestions Brawn could return. And speaking ahead of the team’s home race in Monza this weekend, Mattiacci reveals Ferrari would love to see Brawn back with the Prancing Horse. ‘Ross Brawn is an iconic figure at Maranello, said Mattiacci. ‘Everyone would like to have Ross or would like to see Ross back at Ferrari.’ Time for a return: Brawn would be welcomed back at Ferrari, according to Marco Mattiacci . Brawn was snapped up by Ferrari from Benetton where Schumacher won consecutive titles in 1994 and 1995. He then established his own team from the ashes of Honda which saw Jenson Button storm to the 2009 title before helping to lay the foundations for Mercedes’ dominance this season. Speaking to CNN’s, The Circuit, Mattiacci added: ‘He’s one of the most respected personalities in F1 with the highest knowledge and pedigree.

"By . Rob Wildman . It's back: The Daily Mail Schools Trophy returns . An eagerly awaited North-South showdown launches the second Daily Mail Schools Trophy when Whitgift host Sedbergh on Saturday. The clash is a first trip for the Cumbrian rugby establishment - whose old boys include Will Carling and Will Greenwood - to Whitgift, the Croydon-based school who helped nurture Danny Cipriani and Marland Yarde. Last season, Woodhouse Grove, the Bradford-based school, inched out Sedbergh to win the Trophy and were rewarded by a visit from Sir Clive Woodward. ‘We’ve travelled up twice to Cumbria and lost twice,’ said Whitgift’s head coach Chris Wilkins. Glory: Woodhouse Grove School from Bradford lifted the inaugural Daily Mail Schools Trophy last season . ‘But the one time they were due to come to us there was an outbreak of mumps at Sedbergh and the fixture was called off.’ Sedbergh lost only once last season and so, understandably, Wilkins is keen to face them on home turf. ‘It’s a great game to start the season. We expect another good contest,’ Wilkins said. Sedbergh and Whitgift are among the pack out to stop Woodhouse Grove, who went 12 games unbeaten last season. Woodhouse Grove - Adrian Sweeney: ‘We’ve lost 11 of our squad so we need to rebuild. But we still expect to be competitive. We have some good players coming through and some very promising teams further down.’ Sedbergh - Simon Mulholland: ‘We went on tour to South Africa in the summer and it provided exactly the sort of rugby we wanted. We played some excellent rugby in helping to put a new team together.’ Hampton - Zoran Higgins: ‘We’ve had five or six good seasons now so we’ve set the standards high. We expect to do well and hope to be very competitive, but there some good teams around and you always expect tough games.’ Whitgift - Chris Wilkins: ‘We have a hard working group which has been bolstered by some very good players from our Under 16 squad. We have a tough fixture list so let’s see how we get on.’ Dulwich - Sam Howard: ‘It’s looking like a transition season for us and we are not as big. But we are hoping our backline will play some very exciting rugby. Consistency will be the key.’ Brighton College - Nick Buoy: ‘We are looking to have a strong squad. A lot of the players from the lower sixth gained good experience last season and are ready to step up.' Pedigree: Croydon-based Whitgift helped nurture England stars Danny Cipriani (pictured) and Marland Yarde . To cap that success Woodhouse completed a national double by capturing the schools’ 20-20 cricket title. This year, however, they will field a new-look team with 10 or 11 new faces due to pupils moving on. Grove should know if they have a title-challenging squad by the end of September, as their opening games are against two of Yorkshire’s strongest schools - St Peter’s York and QEGS Wakefield. Elsewhere, RGS Wycombe host Wellington and Millfield on successive Saturdays, while Solihull, who came fifth last year, face trips to rivals Old Swinford and King’s School, Worcester.

"By . Marcus Townend for the Daily Mail . Up-and-coming trainer Hugo Palmer is considering an ambitious tilt at the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf in California with Aktabantay. After the colt had scrambled home by a short-head under jockey Ryan Moore to land Saturday’s Group Three Solario Stakes at Sandown, Newmarket-based Palmer — who is in his fourth season training — revealed that taking the son of Oasis Dream to Santa Anita at the end of October is a serious option. Promise: Aktabantay (right) under jockey Ryan Moore won Group Three Solario Stakes at Sandown on Saturday . Palmer, 33, said: ‘It is something we will discuss over the next few weeks. He is also in the Dewhurst Stakes. He is lovely horse for next year. ‘We would get quick ground and a fast pace in the Breeders’ Cup — they go flat to the boards — and he will be suited by that. He is a very exciting horse.’ Having won valuable handicaps at both Glorious Goodwood and York’s Ebor meeting this summer, the Solario win of Aktabantay was a first at group level for Palmer, a scion of the biscuit-making family. Up-and-coming: Palmer, 33, is only in his fourth season as a trainer but will be pleased after recent successes . The colt’s Turkish owner Ibrahim Araci had previously won the Solario in 2010 with Ed Dunlop’s Native Khan, a colt which went on to finish third to Frankel in the 2,000 Guineas. Palmer had fitted 370,000-guinea purchase Aktabantay with cheekpieces to help him concentrate after the colt had finished third twice in three of his first four races.","Hugo Palmer is in his fourth season training and has been very successful .

"By . Ian Ladybourn, Press Association . St Helens took advantage of the first-half dismissal of Leeds centre Joel Moon to earn a precious win that takes them a step closer to securing top spot in the First Utility Super League. The Challenge Cup winners were forced to play for an hour with 12 men after centre Moon was sent off by referee Richard Silverwood midway through the first half for an illegal shoulder charge on St Helens centre Mark Percival, who had to be substituted. With skipper Kevin Sinfield and stalwart Jamie Peacock at the heart of a superb defensive effort, the Rhinos looked capable of hanging on but the task proved beyond them as Saints came from 12-2 down to snatch a 13-12 victory that takes them five points clear of nearest rivals Wigan. Red mist: Joel Moon (right) of Leeds is sent off in the first half following a dangerous tackle from Mark Percival . Stand-off Lance Hohaia was St Helens' hero on his return to the side with a drop goal seven minutes from the end which followed two quick tries against a tiring Leeds defence by Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook and James Roby. Now only Castleford can prevent Nathan Brown's men from clinching the league leaders' shield but they will need to win their last three games and hope Saints slip up in both their last two. Leeds, who were without two of their Cup final heroes, Danny McGuire and Rob Burrow because of injury, have now lost three successive league matches to take some of the shine off their Wembley triumph. Saints took the lead with a fifth-minute penalty goal from Percival but then spent most of the first half on defence. With hooker Paul Aiton revelling in his rare opportunity to start a match and Peacock and Jamie Jones-Buchanan tearing into the Saints defence, the home side were full of attacking threats and that did not change even when they were reduced to 12 men with Moon shown a red card for his ugly challenge on Percival. Sinfield kicked his side into a 4-2 lead with a couple of penalties and the Rhinos scored the only try of the first half on 29 minutes when Brett Delaney's probing run stretched the St Helens defence and half-back Liam Sutcliffe went past a wrong-footed McCarthy-Scarsbrook to touch down. Sinfield's conversion made it 10-2 and he added another two points with a third penalty on the stroke of half-time. Saints rarely threatened and when a break out of defence from winger Tom Makinson eventually set up a promising position for them, they failed to make the most of it when Jordan Turner got in the way of team-mate Willie Manu's dash for the line. The visitors improved dramatically in the second half, with full-back Shannon McDonnell making an impact on attack in his second appearance for the club. Leeds defended magnificently, though, and Sinfield temporarily relieved the pressure with his first 40-20 kick of the season. However, the momentum was firmly with Saints and it was no surprise when they eventually prized open the home side's defence, with Hohia putting McCarthy-Scarsbrook through a gap for a try on 62 minutes. Turner fluffed the comparatively easy goal-kick but Makinson was on target seven minutes later to convert Roby's try from dummy half to tie the scores and Hohaia kept his nerve to land the all-important drop goal.","Lance Hohaia seals victory with late drop goal .

"By . Sam Cunningham for the Daily Mail . Follow @@samcunningham . The vultures who have been circling Southampton finally descended this summer and tore great chunks out of the club. Liverpool have had the biggest feed, devouring their heart, Adam Lallana, and the guts, Rickie Lambert. On Sunday, they went for the spine with Dejan Lovren completing his £20million move to Anfield. Manchester United ripped out the most tender part of all in young full back Luke Shaw. Tottenham took off with the brain; their manager Mauricio Pochettino. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Southampton's two summer signings Tadic and Pelle . Mass exodus: Southampton have willingly allowed a number of key players to leave the club this summer . Switch: Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert left Southampton for Liverpool following an impressive season . Red Devil: Talented left-back Luke Shaw joined Manchester United from Southampton in a £30million deal . Man at the helm: Mauricio Pochettino left St Mary's this summer to take charge of league rivals Tottenham . And Arsenal are ready to swoop for £12m right back Calum Chambers and rival Tottenham for midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin. But what’s left of a club who, in just four seasons, rose from League One to an eighth-place finish in the Barclays Premier League? A side who in their first campaign back in the top flight were described as the best to play at Old Trafford, by Sir Alex Ferguson. Since former executive chairman Nicola Cortese quit in January after a dispute with owner Katharina Liebherr, there has been a complete overhaul at the top. New manager Ronald Koeman insists he was aware of the situation after meeting their head of football development Les Reed. ‘The first meeting with Les was open and the information was clear about the squad,’ said Koeman. ‘I knew Lambert, Lallana and Shaw would go. I had no influence on that. The most important message I gave is that we will keep the philosophy and ambition of the club.’ Plenty to shout about: Saints centre-back Dejan Lovren is on the brink of a £20million switch to Liverpool . VIDEO Dejan's a done deal for Liverpool . Soon to be rivals? Calum Chambers is moving to Arsenal while Morgan Schneiderlin is wanted by Spurs . In their first game last season, a 1-0 win at West Brom (Aug 17), Saints’ starting XI included Chambers, Lovren, Fonte, Shaw, Schneiderlin, Lallana, Lambert and Rodriguez. All have left or been linked with moves. TEAM: Boruc; Chambers, Fonte, Lovren,Shaw; Lallana, Schneiderlin, Wanyama,Ward-Prowse; Lambert, Rodriguez. The problem is, those who work closely with Southampton say that the philosophy has altered. One source said: ‘Under Cortese it was very much like Barcelona or Real Madrid, where it doesn’t matter who the head coach is it’s just that you do right by the club.’ In March, Liebherr appointed Ralph Krueger as chairman — a bold move given he had no football experience, though he had just led Canada to ice hockey gold at the Winter Olympics. His complete absence from Southampton in the past six weeks, during such a crucial period, has not gone unnoticed by staff even though he has been keeping in touch by telephone. Critics argue that Liebherr and Krueger know nothing about football and Reed is out of his depth. ‘Getting Katharina to stabilise the club after Cortese left is like getting a lunatic to run an asylum,’ said a source who has worked with a number of top-flight clubs. Promises that Reed made to the fans in April have already been shattered. ‘We want to retain the players we’ve got,’ he said. ‘I think our fans deserve to understand that there is not going to be a fire sale here.’ Three months later their four best players have gone or are about to go with others set to follow. Matt Le Tissier, who played for Southampton for 16 years, suggests losing key figures around the club is nothing new. ‘When you’re a club of our size after the season we had there’s always a chance vultures will nick our best players,’ he said. ‘We’ve had to live with that, we’ve generally sold our most talented boys that came through our system. That’s the way it is.’ Bad boy: Inter Milan are keen on signing Dani Osvaldo who joined the Saints from Roma last summer . On target: Frontman Jay Rodriguez has at least been offered a new deal to ward off any potential suitors . Adamant: Nicola Cortese believes Southampton's star men would have stayed had he remained in charge . But another Saints legend Mick Channon is upset. ‘I don’t know when this is going to stop,’ he said. ‘It’s sad to see a side which was only going to get better being broken up. It’s getting beyond a joke. It’s the fans I feel for.’ It is understood the majority of funds made from sales — £27m for Shaw, £25m for Lallana, £4m for Lambert and £20m for Lovren — will be spent on recruitment. They are looking to sign six players in total for around £10m each rather than three at £20m. They have already signed Dusan Tadic from FC Twente for £10.9m to replace Lallana and spent £8m on Feyenoord’s Graziano Pelle for Lambert. They will stick with their policy of bringing through players from their highly successful academy. For instance, 18-year-old Matt Targett is seen as the long-term replacement for Shaw. ‘When we start the season we will have a very good team,’ Koeman insisted. ‘We will bring in players with even better qualities.’ But promises have already been broken and some are tipping Southampton for  relegation. Indeed, the club’s future could well be decided by the time the transfer window shuts at the end of next month.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . McLaren Group chairman Ron Dennis has promised he will announce his 2015 driver line-up before the end of the season. Current drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen are in limbo as Dennis assesses the market to see who might be available. Although linked with Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel, both men are under contract to Ferrari and Red Bull respectively, and Dennis has previously stated he is a man who respects agreements. On track: But Jenson Button is facing a fight to save his McLaren seat with Ron Dennis assessing his options . One situation he is keeping an eye on is that at Mercedes as former driver Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg go head to head. With Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff also suggesting one or others could be out of a job if they cross the line in future, in the wake of their collision at Spa, that has placed Dennis on alert. McLaren are ready to offer him an escape route. They and Honda, their engine partners of next season, want a marquee signing to end a period of decline at the team. Button, who is 34 and thought by the McLaren hierarchy to be small fractions short of fast enough, could well make way. Ron Dennis (centre) is courting a reunion with former McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton, who left the team in 2012 . For now, Dennis maintains he does not know who will be behind the wheel in 2015, but insists an answer will be delivered come the conclusion to the season in Abu Dhabi in late November. 'We always have the best available drivers,' said Dennis. 'Without being derogatory, detrimental or negative to your existing drivers, the first thing you have to establish, before you have any process of selection, is who is available. 'No-one could have predicted the tension inside Mercedes-Benz, or imagine a range of scenarios that could see one of those drivers on the market by the end of the year. 'That does not mean we would automatically reach for that driver, or any other driver, in preference to what we have. Rookie: Kevin Magnussen has impressed on his debut year with McLaren but his seat for 2015 is not yet safe . 'What it means is you are trying to understand who is available, and then you make a decision. It could be that decision is not to change. 'That's because stability, as we go into the relationship with Honda (power unit supplier from 2015), has huge value, and loyalty is very important to me too. 'So as for a decision, it certainly won't be in the next few days, and it won't be at the end of the season, it will be something in between.' Dennis insists Button and Magnussen are in the loop as to his plans, adding: 'I am a huge fan of both Kevin and Jenson - Kevin has done an amazing job. 'We are delighted with our drivers, and I have apologised to Jenson for the distracting elements of where we are at the moment. 'But we've always tried to understand driver availability, and at this moment there is no decision to take. 'All I'm doing is making Kevin and Jenson completely aware the best thing they can do is their best job and not get distracted by the whole thing. There is nothing to be distracted by.' Dennis has confirmed, though, Honda are involved in the selection process. It has long been understood Honda are driving McLaren to recruit an A-list name for their return to F1 after what will be a seven-year absence. 'We would not, for one minute, not involve them in the decision, but the decision is ours,' said Dennis.","Lewis Hamilton could make sensational return to British team .

The Sky Blues were playing their first game at their home stadium since April 2013, following a dispute between the stadium's operators Arena Coventry Limited and the club owners Sisu. The club have been playing 35 miles away in Northampton, prompting fans to boycott 'home' games, but they flocked back to the stadium as the first team football returned to Coventry. Decisive: Frank Nouble scored after nine and a half minutes on debut to celebrate Coventry's Ricoh return . The first of many: Nouble celebrates his side-footed strike as the loanee made the perfect debut impact .

Subs: Fish, Glenn Morris, German, Linganzi, Pritchard, McKain, Norris. Referee: Keith Stroud (Hampshire) A massive attendance of 27,306 fans flooded the Ricoh Arena, forcing kick-off to be delayed by 15 minutes as the club tried to ensure everyone could get in. And those who were part of the sell-out crowd were rewarded early on, as Steven Pressley's side responded brilliantly to the home support. James O'Brien's acrobatic volley in the sixth minute may have lacked power and accuracy, but the attempt, and the football that preceded it, demonstrated purpose, ambition and quality down the Coventry left, and was a sign of things to come. Four minutes later Nouble put Pressley's side ahead. Again the move came from the left hand side, Ryan Haynes getting in behind before cutting the ball back to the former West Ham forwrard, who sidefooted home from eight yards. At the other end Ryan Allsop was rarely worked in the first 45 minutes, although Haynes almost deflected a cross into his own net on the stroke of half time. Many happy returns: Many fans had refused to attend home games during the club's absence from the city . Good to be back: Scarves celebrating the return from Northampton were sold outside the Ricoh Arena . In control: Conor Thomas holds off Gillingham's Bradley Dack as Coventry dominated the first half . Feeling sky blue: Gillingham were unable to cope with a Coventry side lifted by their huge support . After the break Coventry were again on top, and Nouble almost turned provider for John Fleck on 48 minutes, but the Scot couldn't make a good enough connection from five yards. Gillingham were still on the back foot, but they began to create chances as the game wore on, Kortney Hause heading over from a corner, and Jermaine McGlashan bursting past the Coventry defence into the box, before a poor decision to pass instead of shooting ended the attack. Coventry were still the better side however, and on 65 minutes they almost doubled their advantage, Fleck's audatious attempt from 40 yards out on the touchline kept out by a combination of keeper and crossbar. With fifteen minutes to go Pressley's men were almost made to pay for failing to turn their chances into goals. A free-kick from the left hand side found the head of John Egan but, under no pressure, he headed well wide. Winning ways: Steven Pressley celebrates as Frank Nouble gives Coventry the lead after nine minutes .

Cody McDonald could have earned his side a point, but he fired a difficult volley into the side-netting five minutes from time. Had it gone in, it would have been a strike worthy of a point. Then, in the final seconds Allsop allowed a cross to bobble along the six-yard box, but no-one in a red shirt could turn it home. In the end though, Coventry held on for their victory. Given the pain of the last seventeen months, you couldn't begrudge their happy fans their three precious points. Pressley was clearly proud of the victory and believes the return has finally given the club a platform to progress. He said: 'I said all along I have huge sympathy for the supporters because clubs are built around them. The return in many respects shows their value to a club. They voted with their feet and forced the club to where it truly belonged. 'I hope it's not a false dawn. We have so much work ahead of us. I think we have given people hope and that's vital. 'It was an outstanding night and I was exceptionally proud to be the manager of the club, we showed our true potential. 'I'm pleased with the result because I have seen many of these scripts before, when we turn up in numbers and everyone expects us to win and we end up with egg on our face.'","Coventry playing at Ricoh Arena for the first time since April 2013 .

"By . Sam Peters . English professional football has been warned it faces a ‘tsunami’ of damaging legal claims that will cripple some clubs if managers continue to over-rule doctors and allow concussed players to play on. In an exclusive interview with the Mail on Sunday, the Football Association’s senior doctor Ian Beasley this week said the NFL’s massive legal settlement with former American Footballers suffering from early on-set dementia linked to head injuries — now in excess of £870million — has set a precedent other sports would be foolish to ignore. The last Premier League season saw an alarming number of incidences where managers ignored team doctors and allowed concussed players to return to play while this summer’s World Cup in Brazil also saw players with head injuries, including Uruguay’s Alvaro Pereira and Germany’s Christoph Kramer, play on. VIDEO Scroll down to watch England players star in FA appeal to reduce concussion risks . Latest case in football: Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer was allowed to play on in the World Cup final . Eventually subbed: Kramer leaves the pitch after being concussed during Germany's match against Argentina . ‘Clubs need to be aware that if they make mistakes and something tragic happens to a player after their manager has over-ruled the medic then it’s the club and the manager who become liable,’ Dr Beasley said. ‘For smaller clubs that could break them financially. We have to make sure they understand what the consequences are. ‘What we have to point out to clubs is that if your staff start over-ruling medical staff it may not be next year or the year after, but there are going to be difficulties. In 10 or 15 years if a player comes back and says: “I’ve got long-term brain damage because of this [concussion mismanagement]” then it’s going to be extremely difficult. It will get hauled through the courts and there will be a lot of bad publicity. The clubs will suffer one way or the other. We need to make sure they understand that. ‘When you’ve got precedent of a tsunami [the NFL pay out] coming your way the best thing to do is to build your defence properly so you can withstand the tsunami. Because it could come our way there is absolutely no doubt in my mind about that.’ Last week the FA announced their head-injury guidelines, in conjunction with the Premier League and League Managers’ Association, which state that all players who have lost consciousness or are suspected of losing consciousness must be removed from the field immediately. Dr Beasley, along with FA chairman Greg Dyke, will hold an hour-long meeting at Wembley ahead of today’s Community Shield match with the family of former England and West Bromwich Albion centre forward Jeff Astle, who died in 2002 aged 59 suffering from dementia linked to heading footballs. A coroner found Astle’s death was caused by ‘industrial disease’ while in May this year one of the world’s pre-eminent neuropathologists, Dr Willie Stewart, re-examined tissue samples from his brain and found evidence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) – the same disease found in brains of deceased American Footballers, boxers and rugby players. ‘The release of the concussion protocols for the new Premier League season indicate a desire to progress this issue and I’m encouraged by the FA’s leadership,’ said Dr Stewart, who will accompany Astle’s widow Laraine and daughters at today’s meeting. ‘My hope is it translates into meaningful initiatives beyond the first week of the season and that where the FA lead, other associations in football and wider sport might follow.’ Premier League case: Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was allowed to play on against Everton in November . Dyke apologised in April after a Mail on Sunday investigation found that a joint FA and PFA study into head injuries in football promised in 2002 was never completed, prompting Astle’s family to accuse the authorities of ‘sweeping the issue under the carpet’. The have since set up a ‘Justice for Jeff’ campaign and have been approached by former professional players and their families convinced they are suffering similar neurological problems to the ones he faced. The family, who are not seeking financial compensation, will ask for the FA to acknowledge their father’s death was caused — at least in part —by playing football while also calling for an extensive new research project to be established and consideration given to a body being set up to support retired players suffering dementia. ‘We know that repetitive head injury causes CTE — I think that’s reasonable from the evidence from the States —there’s still some doubt about how that applies to football,’ Beasley added. ‘That’s why we need more research. I don’t have an axe to grind one way or another. I want to make the game safe. But we need to definitively understand what playing football does to brains.’","Football Association's senior doctor Ian Beasley said massive NFL legal settlement linked with early on-set of dementia has set a precedent .

"By . Sam Peters . In the week FIFA were hit with a potentially crippling law suit over football’s ‘negligent’ handling of head injuries, the world governing body have launched a mental-health research project. The class action suit, filed last Wednesday by a group of parents and players in California, alleges football’s governing body have acted ‘carelessly’ and ‘recklessly’ in their management of head injuries — a move which could have far-reaching implications for the sport. The filing reads: ‘FIFA presides over this [concussion] epidemic and is one of its primary causes.’ Injured: This summer’s World Cup in Brazil was blighted by cases where players carried on with the game . Succumbing: Germany’s Christoph Kramer was eventually taken off in the final but initially kept playing . This summer’s World Cup in Brazil was blighted by a spate of cases where players — including Germany’s Christoph Kramer in the final — were allowed to play on after suffering concussion. Last season’s Premier League also saw a number of alarming cases, one of which involved Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, where medics were over-ruled by management desperate to return players to the field. Earlier this month the FA’s head of medicine, Dr Ian Beasley, told the Mail on Sunday football could face a ‘tsunami’ of damaging legal claims if it fails to radically improve its protocols. Beasley’s prediction appears to be coming true in the US. The so-called ‘soccer moms’ lawsuit is not seeking financial compensation but is looking for rule changes which allow for adequate time for off-field assessment while limiting the number of headers allowed by children under 17. Symptoms such as depression, increased aggression levels and increased risk of suicide have all been linked to repeated concussions, and FIFA’s investigation into mental health issues in football appears to be in response to the lawsuit. Adamant: Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris overruled his medics and played on despite his injury . Dazed: Lloris is led off by medical staff but returned to the action soon after and did not want to go off . Back: Lloris, against his medical advisers' wishes, came back on the field after sustaining a head injury . ‘Any scientific data on the mental health of athletes is rare, and almost no scientific study has yet investigated the mental health among football players,’ the statement read. ‘To respond to this gap in knowledge, FIFA has established the new research area, so that those in the game feel more comfortable coming forwards to talk about issues and in order to ease access to treatment.’ Last week a group of sports medics — including representatives from the NFL, FIFA, the International Rugby Board and Australian Rules Football — met in New York to discuss what some have termed a ‘concussion crisis’. ‘Fifa’s decision to start research into mental health issues in the same week as a law suit is filed may be coincidence,’ said one attendee. ‘There appears to be so little understanding of head injuries within the organisation they may not even have realised the link.’","FIFA hit by law suit over football's 'negligent' handling of head injuries filed by group of parents and players in California last Wednesday .

Natural make up accentuates Pamela's piercing blue eyes and shapely cheekbones as she poses sweetly in front of the cameras, but notably her wedding ring is still missing. It comes after she was seen out and about wearing the ring suggesting that things with husband Rick Salomon are definitely back on. Like butter wouldn't melt: The 47-year-old looked unrecognisable as she flaunted her new look .

In July, just weeks after marrying Salomon for a second time, Pamela filed for divorce but the blonde bombshell has now filed a petition asking a judge to toss out the divorce filing. Pamela filed the dismissal request on August 21, according to People magazine, just weeks after the pair enjoyed a cosy holiday in Copenhagen, Denmark. Apparently Pamela was only trying to force the wayward Salomon to tow the line when she hit him with divorce papers. Change of heart: Pamela Anderson has apparently filed a petition requesting the court to dismiss her July divorce filing against husband Rick Salomon (pictured with her on May 16 in Cannes, France) 'Pam felt the only thing she could do at this point in her relationship and marriage to Rick was to file for divorce because of his wild partying,' an insider claimed. 'They love each other, but it's always a roller coaster with Pam and Rick. No one should be shocked if they reconcile. Since she filed for divorce, Rick has been begging Pam to halt the proceedings.' Pamela, who has two teenage boys with ex-husband Tommy Lee, gushed about Rick during a speech at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. After surprising the press by opening up about sexual attacks she endured during her childhood, Pamela called Rick her 'Angel.' 'He is the only man besides my boys that I trust,' she said. She added: 'His way of helping the world to be a better place is by caring for me, protecting me and making me happy. I am so proud of him.'","Pammy adopted a girl next door look for a cover shoot .

"By . Liam Heagney . Barry O’Driscoll’s phone suffered a meltdown the other week. He was in Tenerife on holiday, enjoying a sports-free Friday night in the Spanish tourist mecca, when he received the same advice from numerous people. Check out the Florian Fritz incident in the Toulouse versus Racing Metro match was the suggestion. He did and what he saw appalled him. Rugby across the board is supposed to have cottoned on to the fact that concussion is no good for any player and a concussed player is no good for any team, but what happened at Stade Ernest Wallon made a complete mockery of the supposedly-increased surveillance. Protest: Barry O'Driscoll resigned as IRB medical advisor due to its introduction of a five-minute concussion bin . Although bloodied and clearly unsteady on his feet when being taken off following a scary collision between his head and a Racing player’s knee, Fritz was patched up and eventually sent back into the fray at the behest of his coach Guy Noves, who was shown by the television cameras at the door of the medical room pressurising his staff and player to get a move on. Fritz played six more minutes before common sense finally prevailed. He would not return for the second half. ‘It was horrific,’ says O’Driscoll, adding that sort of impact to the head can cause damage to the brain. ‘That is the sort of thing the IRB, even with their protocol, are not going to be able to control if it is a vital game.’ The medical expert insists power of TV and the huge influence of the commercial side of the game focuses on the glory for a club and not player welfare. It’s not the only development this month that has concerned O’Driscoll, though. It’s nearly two years now since he resigned as a leading IRB medical advisor due to its introduction of the controversial five-minute concussion bin. That trial had its notable malfunctions, most infamously the sorry sight of the Wallabies sending George Smith back into battle against the Lions last July when he was in no fit state to do so following a head collision with Richard Hibbard. Barry O’Driscoll’s phone suffered a meltdown the other week after the Florian Fritz incident in the Toulouse versus Racing Metro match. Head injury: Toulouse centre Florian Fritz returned to the field of play . However, O’Driscoll  was left gobsmacked the other week when the IRB hailed its experiment a success in forcing a drop in the number of concussed players returning to the field of play. But more depressingly for the former Irish international, he learnt that the pitchside concussion assessment [PSCA] will now double in duration from five to 10 minutes to accommodate altered balance and memory tests. O’Driscoll still vehemently insists — as he has always done — that the policy should be zero tolerance. Nothing else. That if a player is recognised as showing concussion symptoms he is taken off and that’s it. No second chance because a five-minute or the soon-to-be 10-minute check is, in his belief, simply not sufficient when dealing with the grey matter of a brain injury. ‘There needs to be zero tolerance on this, not varying degrees if you show signs you are concussed. Pure and simple,’ he insisted. ‘Doing a five-minute or a 10-minute assessment, it becomes completely arbitrary. The IRB have confused and trivialised concussion. ‘The experts still don’t know exactly the full significance of concussion but every bit of research that is coming out is really bad news. ‘There can be no messing about with the brain. Discussion: Brian O'Driscoll was concussed during the match with New Zealand and spoke to Dr Eanna Falvey after the half-time whistle . Family affair: Frank O'Driscoll, right, celebrates with his son, Brian after Ireland's Grand Slam victory . ‘It’s frightening how little we do know about the brain, but there has been no bit of good news at all about the short or long-term effects of concussion. ‘To say rugby has got a couple of tests on the touchline, that we will get you to stand up straight for a few minutes and clear you, that’s just the wrong way to go about it. ‘It just really frustrates me. People are playing their own agenda on this, whether it is a club agenda or a player agenda or a doctor agenda, and that is because the IRB has given them the opportunity… and now they have given them another layer. ‘They had got five minutes and now they are getting 10 minutes. They have got potential concussion, they have got suspected concussion, four or five different levels and they can get away with it [clearing a player to return to play]. ‘The whole thing is arbitrary now for all different reasons. Different coaches, different clubs making different decisions on the same situations. That has only got one end point, zero tolerance.’ O’Driscoll continues to have no regrets about quitting and going public with his concerns over the PSCA trial. In the high-powered world of “mercs and perks” sports administration, it’s rare for someone to go cold turkey but O’Driscoll was driven by his conscience and will continue to do so despite becoming a persona non grata in the eyes of his former colleagues. Taking a hit: O'Driscoll is tackled by New Zealand's Ma'a Nonu . Making ground: O'Driscoll was part of the Lions squad that beat Australia in the recent Test series Down Under . ‘I miss very much a lot of the people there and a lot of the work I was doing there, just discipline and medicine, but I can sleep at night.’ He’ll sleep even more soundly after this weekend knowing his nephew — Leinster’s Brian O’Driscoll — will have finally hung up the boots and won’t be exposed to any more potential concussions. ‘I’m glad Brian is finishing. For all sorts of reasons he has been an incredible player, one of the best players the world has ever seen. He has carried himself as an example to everybody but he has taken a lot of knocks and I’m just glad he is finishing his tremendous career now. There’s nothing left for him to achieve.’","Barry O'Driscoll  has spoken out against the concussion regulations .

"By . Howard Fendrich . In the heat of the moment, locked in a suddenly tight match after midnight at Flushing Meadows, Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka snapped at a rowdy spectator, telling him to 'Shut up.' An hour later, his 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-1) victory over 91st-ranked Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil in the second round of the US Open complete, Wawrinka was able to laugh about the exchange. 'At the end of the day, they start to get a little bit drunk,' Wawrinka said at his news conference, shaking his head and chuckling. 'It was OK. I had to talk to a few of them. At the end, it's normal... Everybody was into the match. That's OK. It can happen.' Roaring trade: Stan Wawrinka progressed to the third round of the US Open at Flushing Meadows, but was forced to shout at a spectator who was distracting him . Tough going: The European (right) squeezed past Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci, who took a set . In a match that began on Wednesday and finished after 12.30am on Thursday, the third-seeded Wawrinka quickly built a two-set lead before faltering a bit, muttering aloud at himself after one miss: 'Too many mistakes!' By the time he was in the grind of the fourth set, Wawrinka was talking directly to a fan who was bothering him, turning toward the Arthur Ashe Stadium stands and saying: 'Shut up, man! Seriously, shut up.' Once his mind was back on the tennis, Wawrinka was fine. Wawrinka said afterwards: 'It was comfortable, because I was playing really good tennis. I think I was serving big. I was moving really well and taking the ball early, dictating every point. That's why it (looked) like - not easy, but it (looked) good for me.' Onward bound: Wawrinka will now meet Slovenia's Blaz Kavcic, who upset 30th seed Jeremy Chardy . Bellucci, a left-hander, was ranked as high as No 21 in 2010, but arrived in New York with a record of only 11-10 this season. He entered the match with a 5-19 record against opponents ranked in the top 10, including 0-9 on hard courts. But after a poor start, he began giving Wawrinka some trouble. Bellucci finally earned his first break point of the match in the fourth game of the third set. He converted the chance on a 10-stroke exchange, stumbling as he flubbed a shot that clipped a net cord, then righting himself to deliver a backhand lob winner that landed on the baseline for a 3-1 lead that helped him take that set. Wawrinka called that 'one bad game.' Flair: Thomaz Bellucci returns the ball between his legs during the second round match . And then, making things really interesting, Bellucci went up a break at 2-1 in the fourth set. But Wawrinka was able to break back to get back on serve. At 5-4 in the fourth set, Wawrinka held two match points, but Bellucci saved them to hold serve there and get to 5-5. With a chance to force a fifth set, though, Bellucci faltered in the tie-breaker. 'I tried to focus more on my game and not on what he was doing,' Wawrinka said in an on-court interview. 'Tried to make him work a lot. I was playing a little bit smarter at the end of the match.' Wawrinka made a real breakthrough at Flushing Meadows last year, eliminating defending champion Andy Murray and getting to his first major semi-final in the 35th Grand Slam tournament of his career. He has now reached the third round of the US Open for the fourth time in the past five years. Wawrinka's next opponent is 92nd-ranked Blaz Kavcic of Slovenia, who eliminated 30th-seeded Jeremy Chardy of France 6-2, 6-7 (6-1), 6-3.

"By . Laurie Whitwell for MailOnline . Louis van Gaal’s defensive concerns could deepen after it emerged that the Premier League are yet to sign off on Marcos Rojo’s transfer, partly because of Sporting Lisbon’s involvement with funding group Doyen. Rojo moved to United for £16million eight days ago but has not yet played for Van Gaal. It had been thought that obtaining a work permit was the only delay in his registration being ratified but Sportsmail understands that the Premier League are still processing the paperwork associated with Doyen’s claim to 75 per cent of the transfer fee. The delay would need to be overcome by 12pm on Friday if Rojo is to be eligible for the important encounter with Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday afternoon. It is uncertain whether that will prove the case. Move: Marcos Rojo was unveiled by Manchester United last week after his £16m move from Sporting Lisbon . Theatre of Dreams: Rojo could make his debut against Burnley if the Premier League ratify his transfer . When Rojo was bought by Sporting from Spartak Moscow for £3.5m in 2012 Doyen are understood to have loaned the Portuguese club most of the money. In return the investment fund would receive 75 per cent of any future transfer fee or be repaid in full at a set interest rate – as with a lending bank. But a row between Sporting’s new president Bruno de Carvalho and Doyen broke out when he discovered the arrangement and claimed the club were being put under pressure to sell Rojo to United. Doyen insisted this was never the case but in the end the Argentina international did switch to Old Trafford. Sporting received £8m immediately, with two further instalments of £4m due but Sportsmail understands Doyen have yet to receive a single penny and are considering legal action that could end up in court. United are not implicated in this in any shape and Doyen’s only concern is holding Sporting to the contract the club signed in 2012. In training: Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal speaks to his new signing during training . That wrangle in itself is not holding up the Premier League’s legal team but any transfer involving third-party entities is looked at with great care after the Carlos Tevez affair. On a similar basis it took time for deals to be completed for Manchester City’s Eliaquim Mangala and Liverpool’s Lazar Markovic earlier in the window as guarantees on the ownership of their economic rights were sought. Once the Premier League are satisfied with the issues around Rojo he will be granted permission to play – but until then it leaves Van Gaal without one of his key signings and a defensive headache.","Transfer waiting to be approved, in part because of Sporting Lisbon's association with Doyen .

The Cameroon striker was unveiled as Everton's fifth major signing of the summer and revealed that he has selected the unusual No 5 jersey – not a number usually associated with strikers – as it 'received wisdom that you change shirts when you get older'. Eto, 33, became embroiled in a spat with Mourinho last season at Chelsea when the Portuguese was revealed by a French television station in a private moment questioning his age – Mourinho later insisted that he was joking.

It is perhaps fate, then, that Eto'o could return to haunt Mourinho on Saturday evening at Goodison Park following his release from Stamford Bridge but the former Barcelona and Inter Milan star stressed he does not have a problem with his old boss. 'The only thing I have to say about Jose is that I want to thank him for giving me my opportunity in English football,' said Eto'o, who has signed a two-year deal. 'It is down to him that I have had the chance to play and integrate into the Premier League. That is the end of the matter.' Everton manager Roberto Martinez is thrilled to have added Eto'o to a group that he has bolstered with Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry, Mohamed Besic and Christian Atsu and Eto'o, who scored 12 times for Chelsea, is adamant he can make a contribution. Joker: Eto'o pretends to be an old man after scoring a goal against Tottenham for Chelsea last season . Thankful: Eto'o is grateful that Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho gave him a chance in the Premier League . 'I wanted to play football here and I enjoyed my meeting with Roberto Martinez,' said Eto'o. 'Everton fit my philosophy on the way the game should be played. I had a good feeling from the comments he made to me. 'I want to bring my experience to the squad. Everton have a winning mentality and I want to help them continue with that. I won't say what we can achieve, I will just concentrate on the philosophy I have of taking things game by game.' Eto'o met Liverpool officials last Friday in Paris and had a medical examination as Brendan Rodgers concerned alternatives should his move for Mario Balotelli fall down but Eto'o is adamant that he could not have joined a better club than Everton. 'In the last 10 days I have travelled quite a lot and met a lot of managers,' said Eto'o. 'But the one that gave me most belief was Roberto. I now want to help the team and use my experience. I wanted to stay at the top.' And providing a full explanation of why he picked No 5, Eto'o added: 'The received wisdom is that your numbers change when you get older. Five was available, so I picked that. I could have gone for 22, which is the birthday of my future wife. Maybe next year, if I change again, I will pick that one.'

"By . Jack Gaughan . Follow @@Jack_Gaughan . Blackburn Rovers. The hilariously optimistic Steve Kean, the farcically inept Venky’s. Out they tumbled of the Premier League in disgrace when vociferous chants against the ownership of the club were far more frequent than home goals at Ewood Park. They were only heading in one direction. You felt for the supporters, but couldn’t help but laugh: they were a joke. Even more so when Kean was ‘forced to resign’ in September 2012 with the the club third in the Championship. Further still after the dismissal of Henning Berg 57 days into the post. His replacement, Michael Appleton, last just a week-and-a-half longer. He's going nowhere! Blackburn Rovers have no intention of selling striker Jordan Rhodes to Hull City . Awareness: Anuradha Desia (left, with Venkatesh Rao and Balaji Rao) want to keep supporters on side . It was scarcely believable. Venky’s had to change. They dispensed of the flamboyant yet flappable ‘global advisor’ Shebby Singh and serial caretaker Gary Bowyer was handed the job full-time. That appeared to be a sign of realignment in the second tier, but Bowyer has made moves in his 15 months in charge to suggest that they are ready to kick on. Jordan Rhodes is the man any manager outside the top flight - and more than a few in it - wants leading his line. The much-maligned Rudy Gestede is proving to be a terrific foil, too. Gestede has nine goals in his last eight for Rovers; Rhodes is typically on more than a goal every other game. It is the ongoing situation of the latter that will offer a real insight into where the East Lancashire side are going before the transfer window slams shut. Hull City have made no secret of their desire to spend the money earned from the sale of Shane Long to Southampton on prising away the Scotland international. The offer is touching £12million. The answer is a categoric no. Rhodes only signed a new contract last month and there is absolutely no reason for Venky’s to sell.Sportsmail understands that defiance isn’t borne out of negotiating a strong position for themselves in the market - this isn’t about the money, it boils down to perception. Boiling over: Blackburn fans have made their feelings known about the owners, Venky's, in the past . What a difference: Gary Bowyer has steadied the ship at Ewood Park since taking the job permanently . Rovers’ Indian owners - particularly Anuradha Desai - are very aware of their standing among the club’s support. They want to keep their star striker, who scored in the win against Bournemouth on Saturday, to build bridges - to show they mean business. There has been a fair amount of relationship rebuilding going on since Appleton was given the boot and selling Rhodes would see some good work wiped out in an instant - there is a realisation of the bond between supporters and the player. They do, however, have Financial Fair Play to worry about, which represents a reasonably strong argument to part with the Championship’s best front man for a quick buck. It is not so long ago that the club posted a pre-tax loss of £36.5million following relegation from the Premier League and - in a bid to make a swift return - they overspent on the wages of Danny Murphy, Nuno Gomes and the like. Problems of the last four years have derived from ill-judged decisions stemming from poor advice taken by the owners, rather than an inherent disregard of the club. They are desperate to rectify that. All smiles: Rhodes celebrates with Ben Marshall after finding the net against Bournemouth on Saturday . The monetary situation remains precarious and they could still do with profiting from the sale of players in order to balance the books for the next set of accounts. But allowing Rhodes to depart would be counterintuitive. This season is one where they can attack the top end of the division. Bowyer has made some shrewd signings and they have seven points from their opening four games. This is not a league full of quality rivals. There is an opportunity to win promotion with a solid foundation and a man - or men in this case - finding the net frequently. Add Craig Conway and Tom Cairney into the mix and they’ve a side capable of upsetting the favourites. Rovers recognise they also need new players. Bowyer is over in Pune at the moment and likely to fly back to England with the blessing of Venky’s to go and sign a couple of new faces and utilise the loan market. This isn’t a Kean visit to India. He hasn’t been summoned, he doesn’t have to go every month to provide updates. Bowyer commands their respect and there is a rapport; trust is the operative word. And at the moment, it seems rather tranquil up in Blackburn. They scored almost a quarter of League One’s goals this weekend. Andrew Cole’s son Devante - on loan from Manchester City - get in on the act as they thrashed Gillingham 4-1 at Oakwell. After a miserable couple of seasons at the bottom of the Championship, the Tykes are just looking forward to winning games regularly this season. When will it end for the German? He has won just three games of 16 in charge of Fulham since taking over in February. They were thumped 5-1 at Derby County at the weekend and there is growing talk that the Cottagers could ‘do a Wolves’ and suffer consecutive relegations. Unrecognisable after players have left the club in the last three months. TALENT SCOUT: DANNY ROSE . Danny Rose was someone who made an immediate impact on loan at Bury last season with three goals in six substitute appearances. So when the chance to snap him up permanently from Barnsley arose last week it was a no-brainer for David Flitcroft. The 20-year-old has now found the net twice in his first two fixtures for the Shakers - against Luton and then Plymouth - and provides the sort of firepower Bury will need if they are to get out of League Two this season.

"By . Melanie Mcgrath for MailOnline . On a freezing night last February, the body of 13-year-old Mackenzie Howard was found lying in the back porch of the church in the tiny, remote village of Kake, Alaska. She had been battered to death. In one of the world’s most hazardous natural environments, the real dangers for women living in the Arctic come not from polar bears or cracking ice but from the men they live among. Mackenzie Howard’s body lay outside the church in Kake for 11 hours after it was found. With a population of 559, Kake is just one of 75 remote Alaskan villages with no police force. Scroll down for video . Remote: While some women live wonderful lives in the Arctic, for many others, the reality is quite different . The state currently employs one trooper for every million acres and it’s the same story across the Arctic. Of the 53 communities in the Arctic Canadian province of Nunavut, only 28 have Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachments. 15 of these are staffed by only two people. In the absence of police, according to a report into Mackenzie’s murder in the Washington Post, Kake residents were forced to set up a rota to guard the body and patrol the village. Since the only way out of Kake is by plane or boat, the killer was still at large in the community. State troopers arrived the following morning. It took investigators another few hours to make the journey from Anchorage, 1000 miles away. Speaking to the Washington Post, Teresa Gaudette, chair of Kake’s public safety committee, said, ‘It can be terrifying. When something happens, we have to call 911 to get a state trooper to come. Isolated: Many villages such as this one in Alaska are extremely isolated and can become cut off during winter . Distant: This street sign reveals just how far away the remote villages of Alaska really are . 'Then, it can take a few hours to a day or two…by the time they get here, sometimes nothing can be done because there’s no evidence. People can just get away with it.’ Mackenzie’s mother, Marla Howard, added: ‘People don’t really fear the law here.’ They have reason not to. Even where it exists, law enforcement often fails to act. The New York Times recently reported the story of a 19-year-old Alaskan woman raped in the remote fishing village of Emmonak. After an intruder broke into her home and attacked her, she called the local tribal police and left a message on their voice mail. No one ever returned her call. Her attacker remains in the village. The woman reportedly knew of five other women who had been raped by the same man, none of whom reported the crime. Police can take the view that the prosecution of sexual crimes is too disruptive of community relations. A culture of victim-blaming is rampant in tiny, remote villages where, if prosecuted, the perpetrators are likely to be sent to correctional institutions thousands of miles to the south. To many Arctic residents that feels like the 21st century equivalent of transportation. In rural settlements across Alaska and Arctic Canada, violent crime against women is reaching crisis levels. A 2010 poll of nearly 900 Alaskan women found that a shocking 37 per cent had experienced sexual violence. According to a survey by the Federation of Natives reported in the New York Times, rates of sexual violence in the US’s largest state stand at 12 times the national average. Rape nearly four times. 74 per cent of victims responded to by Alaska State Troopers were under 18. The situation is so dire that it prompted Alaska Governor Sean Parnell to launch a state-wide initiative in December 2009 to halt what he called ‘the epidemic of domestic violence, sexual assault and child sexual abuse’ in the state. Hostile: Alaska's hard winters mean that the snows often cut remote villages off - leaving women vulnerable . Further east, the picture is the same. In the 53 isolated villages of the Arctic Canadian province of Nunavut violent crime has risen to nine times the national average. Reports of domestic violence are six and a half times more common than in the south. The Inuit women’s group Pauktuutit reported that 52 per cent of women in Nunavut have suffered physical violence, and 27 per cent have been forced into sexual activity. In this frozen, remote zone these statistics remain the tip of the iceberg. The Canadian government estimates that only 29 per cent of domestic abuse in Nunavut is ever reported. A recent Canadian Department of Justice report notes: 'It is truly indeed a war zone in some households, with no protection for the most vulnerable.' The isolation of most Arctic communities makes fear of reprisals a real issue in reporting abuse. Most victims of rape in the Arctic not only know their attackers, they are forced to live side by side with them. Beautiful: The Arctic's stunning scenery conceals high rates of alcoholism and domestic violence . Dangerous: Some think they can do as they please in the wilderness so the area has high levels of sex abuse . Speaking to Canadian-based news network APTN, Suny Jacob of Qimaavik women’s shelter in Iqaluit, the Nunavut capital, insisted that 'people don’t want to report due to fear. They’re afraid of community members.' Even if a woman does report a sexual assault, there’s very often no refuge or safe house to escape to. Only seven of the 53 communities in Nunavut have shelters. The nearest is often hundreds of miles away. There are no roads out. In Arctic Canada, 15 per cent of homes don’t even have a phone. A plane ticket averages C$1000 (£500). As Associate Attorney General Tony West told the Washington Post, 'Where are you supposed to go? You have nowhere to go.' The reasons for this epidemic of violence are complex. Economic deprivation, custom and the often bewildering speed of social change all play a part. Native custom dictates that sexual violence is rarely talked about. As a result, abuse gets passed down between generations. Trafficking: Many young girls are trafficked south by their parents while others suffer appalling abuse . Research: Melanie McGrath has spent years researching the lives of people in Alaska and northern Canada . Overcrowding, homelessness, and resettlement have deprived men of their traditional roles. Arctic women are consistently out-performing men in education and employment, leading to resentment and, among the men, feelings of worthlessness and rage. Soaring rates of alcohol and substance abuse don’t help. The RCMP informally estimates that alcohol is responsible for 95 per cent of all family violence. In a part of the world where, according to a study by the University of Quebec, 25 per cent of young people in Nunavut have alcohol addiction issues, alcohol and drugs are often used as bait by transient outsiders eager to sexually exploit the vulnerable. When a mine opened at Fort McMurray in Arctic Canada police reported an increase in sex crimes of 1400 per cent. The sudden availability of drugs and moonshine, along with jealousies about jobs and money, led to a rise in domestic violence of 1200 per cent. There are stories of young girls being trafficked to the south, or even sold by parents for as much as C$20,000. Right now, mines like that at Fort McMurray are opening weekly. Across the Arctic, women are beginning to speak out, in rallies and village meetings but, in the land of ice, it will take a sea change before young women like Mackenzie Howard can feel even moderately safe or protected by the law.

"By . Stephen Davies . Roberto Soldado and Erik Lamela, two players with plenty of points to prove at White Hart Lane this season, each found the target as Tottenham thrashed Celtic 6-1 in Helsinki on Saturday. It was Lamela’s third goal in four pre-season matches under Mauricio Pochettino as Spurs extended their unbeaten build-up with another impressive performance. Harry Kane, Lewis Holtby, Christian Eriksen and Emmanuel Adebayor, making his first appearance after missing Tottenham’s tour of the US with malaria, were also on target. Scroll down for video . Back on track: Soldado celebrates scoring for Tottenham against Celtic . It rounded off a dismal week for Celtic — their Champions League qualification hopes are hanging by a thread following Wednesday’s 4-1 humbling by Legia Warsaw — and Pochettino admitted he expected more from the Scottish champions. ‘I was hoping for a stronger test,’ he said. ‘We brought a strong squad but it was still a worthwhile game. It wasn’t a waste of time, sometimes these games are more difficult because young players try harder in friendlies.’ New Celtic boss Ronny Deila fielded what was essentially a development side and assistant John Collins defended Celtic’s team selection. ‘The bottom line is the game was arranged in February before we arrived,’ he said. ‘It’s fallen between big European games, so circumstances dictate we come out here with a really young team.’ Clinical: Emmanuel Adebayor fired home from the spot to net Tottenham's sixth goal of the day . Point to prove: Erik Lamela impressed for Spurs netting their fourth goal in the 6-1 thrashing over Celtic . Not that any of that will have concerned Lamela, who is desperate to catch the eye of Pochettino after an injury-hit first year at the club.Signed for £25.7million from Roma 12 months ago, the forward made just three league starts under Andre Villas-Boas and then Tim Sherwood, fuelling speculation that he could be sold. Soldado, too, had a forgettable first year in north London with only six goals following his £26m move from Valencia. Both appear to be very much part of new boss Pochettino’s plans, however. Spurs led 2-0 thanks to efforts from frontmen Kane and Soldado in the fourth and 11th minutes respectively. Jamie Lindsay pulled a goal back for Celtic in the 43rd, but Holtby, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Fulham, restored the two-goal cushion and Lamela made it 4-1 just before the hour mark. An Eriksen free-kick and Adebayor’s penalty sealed the rout in the last 10 minutes, while Celtic’s misery was compounded by a red card for Efe Ambrose — his second this week, having been dismissed at Legia Warsaw — for a foul on Adebayor.","The duo were both on target as Tottenham beat Celtic 6-1 on Saturday .

Stephanie Procter, 33, of Newmarket in Suffolk, is 'inseparable' from her twin sister Gina Breakenbury and desperately wanted twins herself so they could share the same special bond. She fell pregnant with twins with her husband Danny, 32, a mechanical engineer, but suffered a miscarriage. Then incredibly, she conceived a second set. Three generations of twins in the same family, (left to right) Marianne Flack, Marianne's daughter Stephannie Procter with her twin babies Honey and Amalie, Stephanie's twin Gina Breakenbury, and Marianne's twin Valerie Taylor. Identical siblings Honey and Amalie were born just three minutes apart and are now being doted on by their extended family. Proud Stephanie - whose mum Marianne Flack, 61, has a twin sister Valerie Taylor - said: 'It’s been hard work but it’s a dream come true for me.

Even before the scan Stephanie says she had an inkling. 'I told my twin sister I thought I was carrying twins,' she said. 'I didn’t want to tell anyone else in case I was wrong, but I’m so glad I was right.' The twins were born on July 2 at 11.11am, with Honey arriving first, weighing 4lbs 15oz and Amelia three minutes later at 3lbs 15oz. Mum Stephanie with twin Gina growing up .

However, their early days of life were fraught with worry as Honey had an underdeveloped stomach and was taken to the Rosie, a neo-natal unit at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. The twins were separated for 12 days. Stephanie, who is a planning coordinator for a packaging company, said, 'We thought Honey was going to need an operation but luckily in the end she didn’t.' Now nine weeks old, the twins are back at home. Stephanie’s mum Marianne and her husband Danny are taking it in turns to help out.

Stephanie hopes her children Honey (right) and Amalie will have the same 'magical' experience growing up . Stephanie explains: 'All the twins in the family are natural so it’s very rare. Three sets of twins in one family is just amazing. 'It’s hectic when we all get together. The poor husbands, bless them, they hardly get a word in edgeways.' Stephanie's twin, mother-of-two Gina, who works as a commercial analyst, said: 'I loved growing up as a twin and I’m so pleased that Stephanie had her own set of twins because they’ll be exactly the same. 'It’s just brilliant. She’s my best friend as well as my sister. 'We did everything together, netball, clubbing, going on holiday. I’ve never felt alone in my life because I’ve always had Steph - and her kids will be the same. New mum Stephanie (left), pictured here with sister Gina, says having twins herself is 'a dream come true' Marianne (left) and Valerie have been close their whole lives . 'Maybe they’ll be even closer because they’re identical.' Knowing how much hard work twins can be, Stephanie’s mum took some time off work to help out. Proud grandmother Marianne, who works as a labour and delivery domestic at RAF Lakenheath, said: 'I thought it was marvellous when I found out and I was excited for her but, knowing what I know, I thought it would be hard work for the first year. 'Then it’s very rewarding after that. They play together - they’re much better together than bringing them up on their own. 'They were never sad, they were always happy and that’s how me and my twin are. We do everything together and we always have.' Marianne has been married to her husband Stephen, 67, a retired construction worker, for 43 years.She added: 'I’ve got my twin who’s my best friend. 'It’s just wonderful. There’s me and my sister and then my daughters and now my granddaughters. They’re going to have fun together.' Marianne's twin, Valerie, a cleaner, said: 'We’re a close family anyway but with twins it’s very special.'

Making friends: Calum Chambers  with Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain and Wojciech Szczesny in Austria . Right at home: Mathieu Debuchy (left) poses for a picture with team-mate Laurent Koscielny . The defender is with his new team-mates in Austria, with keeper Wojciech Szczesny posting a welcome picture and message of himself, Chambers and Oxlade-Chamberlain on the team bus. Chambers will fight for a first-spot with  Mathieu . Debuchy, who Arsenal signed from Newcastle for £10m after Bacary Sagna joined Manchester City. His arrival means Carl Jenkinson may now leave the Emriates with Hull and West Ham interested in him. Chambers is another product of Southampton's fruitful academy and has been a regular with England U19s. He has signed for an initial £12m - the same price Arsenal paid for Oxlade-Chamberlain - but his fee could eventually rise to £16m in add-ons. Oxlade-Chamberlain's fee could rise to £15m, while Walcott's eventual fee was £9.1m. Chambers is the latest player to leave Southampton, who have already sold Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren to Liverpool for a combined £48m while Luke Shaw has moved to Manchester United. Exit door: Arsenal's Carl Jenkinson is expected to leave when Chambers' deal is finalised . Au revoir: Bacary Sagna decided to swap Arsenal for Manchester City earlier this summer . Moving on: Dejan Lovren signed for Liverpool from Southampton in a £20m deal on Sunday . But executive director Les Reed claims the club were disappointed to lose Chambers and remain commited to signing new players: He said: . 'We are naturally disappointed whenever any of our Academy graduates leave the club, and that is very much the case with Calum’s departure. 'Calum made it clear to us that he did not see his future at Southampton. As such, it was crucial that we were able to negotiate a substantial fee that also reflects the work our staff have put into Calum’s development since he joined the club at the age of eight. 'Our position remains unchanged in that we are determined to keep our best young players at the club, as is evidenced by the decision to award Harrison Reed a new long-term contract last week, adding to the list of committed young professionals like James Ward Prowse, Sam Gallagher, Jack Stephens, Jordan Turnbull, Matt Targett, Sam McQueen and others who have seen plenty of first-team activity recently. 'We have an abundance of talent in the Academy coming through, and everybody at the club is continuing to work hard on bringing in quality new players as we build a team capable of taking us further forward in the coming seasons. 'It is important in the transfer window to remain calm, resilient and above all patient. We have targets, and we are working hard to get them across the line.'

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . The third wife of beloved TV comic actor Phil Hartman, who shot him dead in a murder-suicide in 1998, wrote a venomous four-page letter to his former wife threatening to 'rip [her] eyes out.' For the first time since Hartman's death 17 years ago, the events leading up to his untimely death are being revealed in a new book, You Might Remember Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman. One episode related by Hartman's second wife Lisa Strain proved a terrifying portent of the fury that would see him die at the hands of Brynn Hartman. Tumultuous: Phil and Brynn Hartman were married for 11 years before she fatally shot him as he slept in 1998, then hours later shot herself . Volatile: Hartman's second wife Lisa Strain says that Brynn Hartman sent her a venomous letter telling her to stay away from Hartman and herself after Strain sent a card congratulating them on the birth of their first child . Strain sent a card to Brynn and Phil Hartman congratulating them on the birth of their son Sean Edward in 1988. In return, she received a hate-filled letter that shook her to her core. Brynn Hartman threatened Strain's life and warned her that if she contacted Hartman again she would 'rip my eyes out,' Strain told author Mike Thomas. Strain was so concerned she called Hartman and told him about the vicious letter. Hartman told her that he was partly to blame for the diatribe, because when Brynn has asked him if Strain had been his soul-mate, he said yes. She was horrified to learn that Hartman was aware of the letter - and had even been privy to an earlier draft version that was even worse. Beloved: Hartman got his start on SNL (seen left as Eugene with John Goodman in Anally Retentive Chef skit 1989); A new book documents the life and times of Hartman as well as his untimely death at 49 . She hung up on him and did not speak to her ex-husband again for two years. Ten years after that phone call, Phil Hartman was shot dead by his wife at the home they shared with their two children. Friends of the couple said the couple's confrontations in their sometimes-troubled marriage were fuelled by Brynn's temper and her problems with drugs and alcohol. A pattern emerged in which Hartman would withdraw into himself when Brynn worked herself into a rage, often going to bed and leaving her to cool down alone. That could be the scenario that took place the night Hartman was shot. His body was found in the couple's bed after Brynn pumped several shots into her husband's head. She drove to her friend Ron Douglas's house to tell him what had happened, but he didn't believe her until he saw Hartman's body in the bed. Douglas called 911 and as police were escorting the couple's two terrified children to safety, they heard a shot. Brynn Hartman had shot herself dead. Strain told The Courant in 1998 that Hartman was always a calming influence. They divorced in 1985 because 'we were both unable to do the work necessary to make a good thing better,' but remained friends, she said. 'He was a quiet man and a sensitive and gentle person.' You Might Remember Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman goes on sale September 23.","Phil Hartman's third wife Brynn Hartman wrote a vitriol-filled letter to his second wife Lisa Strain .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A group of award-winning gardeners have been ordered to remove decorative flowerpots from their pathways amid health and safety fears that they are an 'obstruction'. Green-fingered residents of Rialto Gardens sheltered housing in Higher Broughton, Salford, Greater Manchester, have spent the last five years decorating their neighbourhood with a range of flowers including fuchsias, lilies and begonias. And for the past two years they have won second prize for the best communal garden category of a Summer Bloom competition – which is run by social housing provider Salix Homes. However, they have now been asked by Salix to remove around 20 flowerpots and tubs lining a communal footpath next to their homes over complaints about them causing an 'obstruction'. Residents of Rialto Gardens in Higher Broughton, Salford have been told to remove their flowerpots over fears they are an 'obstruction'. Pictured: (from left to right)  Allen Fiander, Jim Brown, Janet Lawson and Valerie Webb . Social housing provider Salix Homes has told residents the flowerpots are causing 'obstruction' to the path . The angry residents claim they flowerpots are not causing an obstruction or hazard and are simply there to brighten the neighbourhood, which they have done so for the last five years since the group took up gardening . Pensioner Valerie Webb said: 'They have never caused an obstruction or an accident. They are only on one side of the railings but we have been told that they are a trip hazard. 'I feel really depressed about this because my gardening is all that I've got. No gardening, no Val.' The 62-year-old added: 'We do it to cheer ourselves up but we won't bother next year.' In a letter to residents, customer support manager Helen Thorpe said: 'While we appreciate that a lot of work has been put in by some of the residents, including you, into the gardens and that this as recognised by the recent award made in the garden competition, we do have to ask that any communal paths or walkways on the scheme are kept clear.' The residents including (from left) Jim Brown, Janet Lawson, Valerie Webb and Allen Fiander, have twice won second prize in the best communal garden category of a Summer Bloom competition run by Salix Homes . The social housing provider sent this letter to residents asking them to keep paths and walkways clear . Pensioner Valerie Webb, who takes pride in her plants, blasted the letter and said: 'I feel really depressed about this because my gardening is all that I've got. We do it to cheer ourselves up but won't bother next year' Salix Homes chief executive Sue Sutton added: 'We appreciate the efforts of all the residents at Rialto Gardens who take such pride in the area and work so hard to keep the communal area looking so pleasant and welcoming. 'However, there are a number of residents in the area who suffer from mobility issues. We have a duty to ensure that the footpaths are clear and accessible at all times. 'We have asked the residents involved to move their tubs into their own gardens or onto a grassed area off the path and we are working very closely with the residents to resolve this issue.'","Residents of Higher Broughton, Salford, have decorated gardens for 5 years .

"By . Alex Finnis for Mail online . The humble hot dog - we know it as the cheap snack you can pick up for a few dollars on the street or during half-time at a baseball game. So you might be more than a little shocked if you decided to buy one from a food van in Seattle, only to be charged $169 (£102). The Junni Ban is what you might call a haute dog, and is the creation of Japanese food fusion specialists Tokyo Dog. World's dearest dog: Tokyo Dog's Junni Ban costs $169 and is topped with truffles, caviar and foie gras . The mouthwatering foot-long smoked cheese bratwurst is topped with butter teriyaki grilled onions, maitake mushrooms, wagyu beef, foie gras, shaved black truffles, caviar and Japanese mayonnaise, all served up in a brioche bun. Chefs need two weeks notice to order and prepare the ingredients, yet despite this and the hefty price tag, five people have already jumped at the chance to sample the world's dearest dog. Tokyo Dog owner Eugene Woo told local media: 'It's an amazing hot dog - it is savoury and tastes fabulous. 'We didn't want to just throw together a load of ingredients, but instead put some real research into it. There was a lot of trial and error to make it a really awesome hot dog. Food fusion: Creator Eugene Woo wanted to make something great, not just throw expensive ingredients on top if it . 'So far our buyers have loved it.' Along with fellow creators Samson Kwong and Rocky Weh, it took Mr Woo a year to perfect the gourmet hot dog. Alan Chang from California was the first to fork out for it, and with four others also buying, the Junni Ban has so far brought in $845 (£510) for the Red Cross, where all proceeds are being donated to. It has been crowned the most expensive on the planet by Guinness World Records, beating the previous record by $23.51 (£14). Mr Woo said: 'The previous record was $145.49, and we thought it would be fun to break that record. 'But it is also for fundraising. We gave away every single penny to the Red Cross.' Although the Junni Ban is officially recognised by Guinness as the world's most expensive hot dog, that does not mean it actually is. Many restaurants decide not to go through the hassle of submitting their dishes for records, as the process can be long and expensive. Tokyo Dog sent their evidence in, including photos and videos,  back on February 23, but only now has the record been recognised. In 2012, New York's 230 Fifth restaurant released a $2,300 creation made out of 60-day dry-aged wagyu and topped with vidalia onions caramelized in Dom Perignon, caviar and sauerkraut braised in Cristal. Hot dogs are not the only fast food which have been given expensive makeovers for the famous Guinness book - the world's most expensive pizza can be found at Gordon Ramsey's Maze restaurant in London and costs  £100. The thin-crust, wood fire-baked pizza is topped with onion puree, white truffle paste, fontina cheese, baby mozzarella, pancetta, cep mushrooms, freshly picked wild mizuna lettuce and garnished with fresh shavings of a rare Italian white truffle, itself worth a whopping £1,400 per kilogram.","Tokyo Dog in Seattle have broken Guinness World Record with 'Junni Ban'

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . An arresting series of photographs of breast cancer survivors bearing the scars of their battles with the disease depict the confronting reality of its aftermath on the body. International fashion photographer David Jay started The SCAR Project in New South Wales' capital of Sydney after a close friend was diagnosed with breast cancer at 29 years of age. The collection of colour and black-and-white photos depict the raw emotions of the survivors with their mastectomy scars who show them off with pride. Scroll down for video . Fashion photographer David Jay started The SCAR Project in Sydney after a close friend named Paulina (not pictured) was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 29 . The exhibition of photos is coming to Sydney on September 11 and will be shown at On Seven at David Jones on Elizabeth Street in the CBD . His friend, Paulina, had the surgery done within two weeks of being diagnosed and Jay described her as a 'beautiful, strong young woman'. 'I had taken Paulina’s picture a hundred times since she was 17,' he said. 'I saw her soon after her surgery and knew I would have to shoot her again. 'I took her picture because, perhaps as a photographer, taking pictures is my way of confronting, understanding and accepting the things I see.' In his photos, Jay said the photos were not about breast cancer, it was about depicting the 'raw and honest' realities of young women . But National Breast Cancer Foundation chief executive Carole Renouf said The SCAR Project shattered the belief that young women did not get breast cancer . Jay knew the subjects had come to him to look beautiful but he did not want to destroy the 'visual integrity' of the photos . Despite National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) bringing the project back to Australian shores, Jay was adamant the photos were not about breast cancer. He said one of things the photos were about was reality and it was 'not always pretty'. 'The images can be uncomfortable for the viewer,' Jay said. 'It forces us to confront our fears and inhibitions about life, death, sexuality, sickness, relationships, et cetera. 'I once read it described as ""unflinching"".' The fashion photographer said he had struggled to shoot The SCAR Project because he wanted the pictures to be 'raw, honest, sincere'. 'I knew why the subjects had come - they wanted something beautiful,' Jay said. 'They had already suffered greatly and although I desperately wanted to serve them, I knew in my heart that compromising the visual integrity of The SCAR Project for the sake of easily digested beauty would serve no one.' Each year around 800 young Australian women under the age of 40 will be diagnosed with breast cancer and the likelihood of recurrence was higher in them . According to NBCF, the types of breast cancer affecting young women are often more aggressive and have a much poorer prognosis . The collection features colour and black-and-white photos depicting the survivors with their mastectomy scars who show them off with pride . NBCF chief executive Carole Renouf said The SCAR Project shattered the common belief that young women did not get breast cancer and depicted the striking reality of what it was like for young women to live with the disease. 'Each year around 800 young Australian women under the age of 40 will be diagnosed with breast cancer,' she said. 'Unfortunately the types of breast cancer affecting young women are often more aggressive and have a much poorer prognosis as well as a much earlier likelihood of recurrence compared to older women. 'We're grateful to David and the subjects of his portraits for the opportunity to share the raw reality of breast cancer with Australians.' The exhibition will be displayed at On Seven at David Jones on Elizabeth Street in Sydney during store trading hours from September 11 to September 21. Jay is an international fashion photographer based in New York and his friend Pauline (not pictured) was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy just two weeks after she found out .

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . The websites dedicated to raising money for Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson have mysteriously stopped accepting donations after collecting nearly half a million dollars - and it's not clear why. Since Wilson's name was released to the public on August 15, two GoFundMe pages have raised more than $433,000 to pay  legal bills and other costs associated with his fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. By Sunday, however, both pages were no longer accepting money, giving donors the message: 'Donations are Complete! The organizer has stopped donations.' Wilson has been in hiding since he was identified as the officer who killed Brown. The teen was shot at least six times in a Ferguson street. Wilson, through friends, has said he was justified in opening fire. However, residents of mostly black Ferguson are furious and the shooting sparked several days of protests. Giving help: Two funds for Officer Darren Wilson have mysteriously stopped accepting donations after raising nearly half a million dollars for him . The shooting is currently under investigation by the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney, as well as the Justice Department. Brown's family and supporters are calling for Wilson to be charged with murder . A GoFundMe page supporting Brown's family has raised $315,000. It is still collecting money. George Zimmerman raised more than $300,000 for his legal defense . The Los Angeles Times reports that a GoFundMe spokeswoman said that company is not responsible for halting donation to the sites 'Support Officer Darren Wilson' and 'Support Officer Wilson.' More than 10,000 people have donated to the two campaigns - with an average donation of about $40. Some donors, however, gave thousands. One contributed $10,000. 'Support Officer Wilson' - which has raised $197,620 - is run by St. Louis police charity Shield of Hope. That charity's directors are Timothy Zoll, a public information officer for the Ferguson Police Department, Jeffrey Roorda, a Missouri state representative, and Joseph Eagan, a city councilman in the St. Louis County town of Florissant - near Ferguson. 'Support Office Darren Wilson' has raised $235,550 and is run by an anonymous GoFundMe user. However, a GoFundMe spokeswoman told the Times that the company could vouch for the user and that they had verified the person collecting the cash. That page is run by a user with the username StandUp - but provides no information about the person or group collecting the donations. Even an email address provided for the page offers no identifying information about the administrators. The organizers had pledged to work with Shield of Hope to ensure the donations go to the right place - but so far, that has not happened. After George Zimmerman was arrested and charged with the murder of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, his supporters raised more than $300,000 online to help pay for his legal defense and living expenses while he was in hiding.","Two GoFundMe sites were set up for Officer Darren Wilson after his name went public .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A woman convinced she was suffering a bout of hayfever has been diagnosed with a brain tumour, leaving her unable to walk. Beth Frazer, from Valley in Anglesey, visited her GP three times, complaining of suffering headaches. But each time her doctor sent the 20-year-old away with hayfever remedies, to try and treat her symptoms. When Miss Frazer's condition worsened she was sent for rounds of rigorous tests. A brain scan revealed a growth, leading doctors to diagnose her with a cystic brain tumour. Beth Frazer, 20, from Anglesey in North Wales, has been diagnosed with a brain tumour after becoming convinced her symptoms were the result of hayfever. She noticed a her left eye had drooped, right, and is now confined to a wheelchair, unable to walk, left . Miss Frazer, a student at the University of South Wales, now requires round-the-clock care, the brain tumour having left her wheelchair bound and unable to walk. She said: 'I feel like a 90-year-old trapped in a 20 year-old's body. 'I feel like an old lady suffering with arthritis because sometimes my body is just so sore. 'My life is nothing like it used to be I was so independent before my diagnosis and now I have to rely on other people every day. 'My family and boyfriend have become my carers and I can't go anywhere without someone being with me.' The singer and songwriter began suffering with symptoms in June this year. After weeks of tests and brain scans, she was finally diagnosed with a pineal cystic tumour. But due to the location of the cyst doctors warned her that surgery was not an option. She is now plagued with health problems including extreme fatigue, anxiety, chronic headaches, insomnia, extreme upper body stiffness and pain, and sensitivity to light. She said: 'I had always suffered with bad hayfever and when it began in June I just thought it was worse than normal this year. The musician visited her doctors three times but was sent home with hayfever remedies, before further tests and a brain scan revealed a growth on her pineal gland . Doctors warned Miss Frazer that due to the position of the tumour, they will be unable to operate . 'I had the usual watery and itchy eyes but then one day I woke up and my left eye had completely drooped down. 'My eye drooped down with my hayfever symptoms for a week or so but came to themselves after a couple of hours. 'I had started to get really bad headaches as well to the point where I couldn't be in any light because it would be so painful. The pineal gland is located in the brain and is responsible for secreting melatonin. Pineal cyst tumours are rare and are normally benign. Commonly the tumours are diagnosed using MRI scans to detect the growth. Symptoms often include problems with eye movement, headache, nausea and vomiting and double vision. Pineal region tumours represent less than one per cent of all primary brain tumours, however three to eight per cent of childhood brain tumours occur in the area. The tumours tend to be diagnosed in young adults, aged 20 to 40. Various treatments are used, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy to reduce the size of the tumours. Surgery can be possible in some patients, to remove part of the growth or insert a shunt to relieve pressure caused by the tumour. 'I was sent to A&E, eye clinics, and two different hospitals for tests but it wasn't until they did the highest strength MRI that they found the tumour. 'We literally came the full circle because when I first went to doctors they said it could be one of three things, inflammation on the brain, a bleed on the brain or a tumour. 'But after the MRI and CT scans came back with no worrying results they ruled out a brain tumour, but that's exactly what it has turned out to be. 'It was hard to be told it wasn't a tumour and be relieved that it wasn't to then be told it was and have to then try and deal with that.' Miss Frazer has been told by doctors that due to the location of the tumour they are unwilling to do surgery as the nine-hour procedure is too risky. The once outgoing student is now on constant pain relief medication to try and keep her symptoms at bay. Doctors at the Walton Centre in Liverpool are also unable to determine whether she will regain use of her legs. Self-employed musician Miss Frazer, said: 'Doctors told me that I am the first person they have seen with this type of cyst that has lost use of their legs. 'I was able to walk with an aid at first but my legs are just too weak now and I need a wheelchair to get around. 'I feel sorry for my family and especially my boyfriend who I live with because he is now not just a boyfriend but he is now my carer.' She has now set up a fundraising page with the hope of raising £150,000 to go to America to see the world's leading experts on pineal cystic tumours. She said: 'It was hard to be told it wasn't a tumour and be relieved that it wasn't to then be told it was and have to then try and deal with that. I was able to walk with an aid at first but my legs are just too weak now and I need a wheelchair to get around' She will also be undergoing cosmetic surgery to correct her left eye. 'I want to get treatment and be able to come out the other side of this and be able to walk and drive and just be a normal 20 year old again,' she said. 'I miss singing as I used to do a lot of gigs and I want to be able to get back to university and continue with my music industry course. 'We have raised near to £4,000 already and I am so grateful to everyone who has donated I just hope it continues so I get as close to my target as I can.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . More than 90,000 are performed in the UK each year and patients often require a second knee replacement or a 'revision' A computer program could help cut costly or unnecessary surgery on patients with knee replacements. Scientists have developed a diagnostic tool to counter the soaring rise of knee replacement operations. More than 90,000 are performed in the UK each year but this is expected to rise by more than 600 per cent by 2030 due to an ageing population, obesity and younger people having the surgery. Patients often require a second knee replacement or ‘revision’, which can cost up to four times as much as the original surgery and bring increased risk of infection and failure. But researchers at the University of Bath have developed a semi-automated computer program to assess the condition of a replacement, a task usually performed ‘by eye’ by surgeons. It gives a score for radiolucency – the region surrounding a hip or knee replacement which is dark on an X-ray and can progressively worsen with loosening – provides a more accurate, independent method to assess the need for extra surgery. Richie Gill, professor of Healthcare Engineering at the university, said: ‘Until we did the work that we did, all radiolucency lines were looked at by eye by the surgeons. 'What was interesting to us was the lack of agreement between different surgeons looking at the X-rays. ‘Using a digital computerised tool that accurately identifies patients with progressive pathological radiolucency, showing severely loosening knee replacements, would ensure correct surgical procedures are applied. 'This will improve outcomes and save money spent on operations which may not ultimately be successful.’ Knee replacements are a highly successful method of relieving the pain and disability of knee osteoarthitis, which usually affects those aged over 40. Researchers at the University of Bath have developed a semi-automated computer program to assess the condition of a replacement, a task usually performed 'by eye' by surgeons . Studies suggest almost one in two people will suffer from symptomatic osteoarthritis – the degeneration of joint cartilage and underlying bone – of the knee during their lifetime. The study, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, compared surgeons’ assessments of radiolucency in 38 knee replacement radiographs with those made by the computer program. There was large variation between the surgeons’ results, with total agreement in less than 10 per cent of zones examined, compared with 81.6 per cent in those of the program’s.","More than 90,000 knee replacements are performed in the UK each year .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A family are today celebrating the arrival of a baby boy, just months after losing another son to a rare heart condition. Lucas Tasker was born just over two weeks ago. But his arrival comes months after his parents Lois and Jason suffered a devastating loss when their 14-month-old son Oscar lost his battle for life. The toddler became the face of a national organ donor appeal after he was born with the arteries to his heart wired the wrong way around. Lois and Jason Tasker from Coventry, welcomed baby Lucas two weeks ago. Four months earlier they lost their 14-month-old son Oscar after he was born with the main arteries in his heart wired the wrong way around . 14-month-old Oscar Tasker (pictured right and left) passed away in April after he was born with the arteries to his heart wired the wrong way around . Mrs Tasker did not find out until three weeks before Oscar's sudden death that she was pregnant with Lucas, by which time she was already 17 weeks pregnant. 'We looked back trying to find any signs, any symptoms, but there was nothing,' the 29-year-old from  Radford, said. 'I wasn't sick like I'd been with the other children - it was like the baby had been hidden from us. 'We didn't know how we would cope. We were the only two people who could look after Oscar and our first thought was how would we look after him.' They struggled to come to terms with the fact there would be a new addition to the family with siblings Abbie, 12, Paige, 10, Ryan, eight, Milo, five and Lyam, four. And with the gruelling demands of caring for Oscar and their other five children, the couple admit they even briefly considered abortion. But they said now, they wouldn't change it for the world. 'Lucas is our gift from Oscar,' said his father, Jason, 34. 'It's like Oscar's been looking after us all. 'Having Lucas has helped us with the healing process.' He said the first few days after Lucas's arrival were tough as they were constantly reminded of Oscar, who was born at Coventry's University Hospital with the main arteries to his heart the wrong way around, starving his body of oxygen. He underwent two emergency seven-hour operations within 24 hours at Birmingham Children's Hospital and was placed on the organ transplant list and rushed to Newcastle's Freeman Hospital. Oscar had spent most his life in hospital, but seemed to have turned a corner when he was welcomed home for the first time to live with his five brothers and sisters before Christmas before his health sadly deteriorated again. Lucas has become one of the youngest organ donors registered on the national database, following in the footsteps of his siblings, Abbie, 12, Paige, 10, Ryan, eight, Milo, five and Lyam, four . Mrs Tasker, said: 'People might think our new baby must be some consolation but it hasn't been easy at all. 'We found it quite hard as we used Oscar's clothes and toys but we've got our heads around it now. 'We just think that if Oscar was here we'd be using all that stuff.' She faced a traumatic birth delivering Lucas at home as planned but encountering complications after her son was born. She was rushed to Coventry's University Hospital for an emergency procedure leaving her husband, a National Express driver, to fear the worst. Now baby Lucas is among the youngest people on the NHS Organ Donor Register after being signed up when he was just a few days old. 'It's so easy to sign up,' Mrs Tasker said. 'You just go on the website. 'All our children are registered. We couldn't expect to receive without doing this.' The family remains passionate about organ donation and continues to raise cash for good causes in Oscar's name, including Zoe's Place Baby Hospice in Coventry and the specialist children's heart unit in Newcastle where Oscar received much of his treatment.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A mother convinced her sore throat was tonsillitis was horrified to discover the pain was actually due to 35 cancerous tumours. Tracey Stear was diagnosed with throat cancer while in hospital for an unrelated procedure. Telling doctors about the lumps, they ordered a biopsy, which confirmed the devastating diagnosis. Surgeons operated on the 52-year-old, opening her throat from her ear to collar bone to remove the growths - two of which were the size of goose eggs. Mother-of-three Tracey Stear was diagnosed with throat cancer after tests revealed 35 lumps in her throat were cancerous tumours . She was fed through a tube for four months and faced repeated rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, losing more than two stone as a result of her treatment. Ms Stear has now beaten the disease and is fronting a national campaign to raise awareness of the early symptoms of cancer. The grandmother-of-two from Plympton, Devon, said she owes her life to Tass Malik, consultant head and neck surgeon at Plymouth's Derriford Hospital, who spotted the problem. She said: 'I had noticed a few lumps and thought it was tonsillitis. I went to hospital for a totally different operation and mentioned I had a problem with my throat, just in case it affected the breathing tube. 'The anaesthetist noticed I had a lump in my neck and took me to a specialist who diagnosed me straight away. Everything just escalated from there. 'I had a biopsy and remember Mr Malik saying: ""I can tell you it's cancer"". It was at a stage where if I had left it a few weeks longer, I wouldn't be here. 'But he said he could cure me - I owe my life to Derriford Hospital and Mr Malik.' Ms Stear had an operation to remove the tumours, followed by three bouts of chemotherapy, then radiotherapy. She said: 'It took the doctors longer to operate because the biggest tumour had attached to the blood vessels - I was picked apart and put back together again. 'I finished treatment on June 4, 2008 and I will always remember that date. I was fed through my stomach for around four months. I lost about two stone - it's the first time I have ever fit in size eight jeans. The 52-year-old credits her life to consultant head and neck surgeon Tass Malik . 'Losing my hair didn't really bother me and I didn't have a wig. I forced myself to eat yoghurts to start eating again and did the Race for Life in a wheelchair. 'I never worry about anything serious any more. I'm quite happy to stand in the rain. 'Life is precious - you don't realise until you nearly lose it. It changes you totally.' Ms Stear, a support worker for people with learning difficulties, is fronting a new campaign with Cancer research UK and Channel 4 to raise money, awareness and accelerate new cancer treatments to save more lives. She is also drumming up support for the March On Cancer event, a series of fundraising marches taking place across the country on October 11. She said: 'I am through it all now and know I was so fortunate that my cancer was caught early. I want to give something back. 'Even so, my treatment was really harsh. I am standing up to cancer so that we can find kinder treatment for people like me. Research is the key.' Alison Birkett, of Cancer Research UK, said: 'One in three people in the UK will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives. 'Thanks to the incredible progress that's been made in the last 40 years, more people are surviving than ever before. 'But we can't afford to stand still. We have the technology and the knowledge to conquer cancer, we just need the funds to turn it into real-life treatments.' Mr Malik and his team operated on Ms Stear at Plymouth's Derriford Hospital, removing the tumours before she was given rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She has now beaten the disease .","Tracey Stear was convinced she had tonsillitis after suffering a sore throat .

"By . James Nye for MailOnline . The search for an Alabama woman missing since 2012 has been cast in an even more sinister light this week with the news that she was raped and abused by her grandmother's boyfriend when she was a young girl. Young mother, Brittney Wood, was raped for two years on and off by, Ronald Robertson, 53, until in 2003, when she was 11-years-old, she accused him of attacking her. Indeed, since 2012, eleven members of Wood's family have been arrested for having sex with underage relatives in Mobile County. Robertson was convicted in 2005 and is currently serving a life sentence for first-degree rape charges. Mystery: 19-year-old Brittney Wood, pictured with her daughter, vanished in May 2012 . While . sexual assault victims are not usually named, the fact that Wood is . missing and her family suspected of systemic pedophilia, AL.Com chose to . name her. Since . her disappearance in May, 2012, after leaving her mother's home, 11 . people including her brother, aunts and uncles have been arrested in . connection with a huge family sex abuse investigation. Police have said in the past that they fear that Wood is dead. The . large investigation is still continuing and seen the arrest of Chessie . Wood, 39, Derek Wood, 23, Brittney Wood's brother, according to AL.Com. The . recently released files from 2003 show that Wood's sexual abuse first . emerged after she reported it to a day care director at a local Baptist . church. 'She . said Brittney asked her if she could talk to her, but she was afraid . that someone would get hurt,' according to the Mobile police report. 'She said Brittney wrote a note and told her, 'He touched me in a bad spot.' When she was 12 years old she testified at Robertson's trial and revealed horrifying details about the case. Arrest that sparked scandal: Brittney Wood accused Ronald Robertson in 2003 and he was sentenced in 2005 . She said that once, she tried to evade Robertson by telling him she was thirsty. 'Finally, he told her to get something to drink and come back to the room,' according to the court records. 'She . left the bedroom and attempted to hide from Robertson to call her . grandmother. Robertson, however, found her naked hiding by the garbage . and told her to get back in his room.' Robertson had know Brittney from birth and had lived with her grandmother for 14 years. 'I helped raise the mother of this child,' said Robertson. 'I'm sorry about what happened,' he said. 'If I hurt them in anyway, I apologize.' The  arrests are linked to missing . mother-of-one Brittney Wood, 19, who hasn’t been seen since she left her . Theodore home, just outside Mobile, to visit her uncle, Donnie Holland, . in the Styx River area, on Thursday May 31, 2012. She was last seen in a car with Holland at Tillman's Corner. Two days later he committed suicide using a gun which Brittney owned. Missing: Brittney Wood hasn't been seen since May, 2012 . Since . then 11 people, either members of the Wood family, or with direct links . to it, have been arrested on charges including rape, sex abuse with . children under 12, incest and sodomy. The . suspects in the sex ring include Brittney’s mother, Chessie Wood, her . brother, Derek Wood, Nelton ‘Butch’ Morgan, Dustin Kent, William ‘Billy’ Brownlee, Mendy Kent, Wendy Holland, James Cumbaa, Randall Scott Wood . and Jennifer Moore, the most recent arrest. Detectives . believe that Brittney may have gone to visit her uncle to confront him . about sex abuse and have voiced their frustration that the one person . who may be able to shed light on the alleged crimes has disappeared. Detective Eric Winberg told Fox 10 news in April 2013: ‘We often (sic) times look for that golden nugget. That one person that can make the difference in your case. Accused: Brittney's mother, Chessie Wood, is charged with two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child less than 12 . Suspects: Randall Wood (left), who's been . charged with second degree sodomy, enticing a child to enter and second . degree rape, and Brittney Wood's brother, Derek Wood (right), who's been . charged with second degree rape and second degree sodomy . ‘In this particular case, Brittney Wood was that person. She was the person that could tell the whole story.’ Police were investigating the abuse before Brittney's disappearance. Detectives . say Brittney exchanged messages on Facebook on May 27, 2012, with one . of the alleged victims, in which abuse was discussed. After Brittney asked ‘how are you? Tell me what's going on. I don't know what's true and what you said’, . the victim claimed to have been raped by Randall Scott Wood, Dustin . Kent, and Donald Holland. ‘I love you, I’m sorry,’ Brittney replied. The alleged victim wrote more messages to Brittney on May 28 and May 30, but did not receive a reply. In October 2012 a police detective testified in the case against Dustin Kent. The court heard that Kent raped a relative at the age of 13 in 2008 while her father watched. According . to the detective, the father took the young girl out in his truck . claiming they were going to buy a hamster from a pet store. Instead they picked up Kent and drove to an industrial park. Disappearance: A smiling Brittney Wood pictured here with her child . Investigation: Donald Holland (left) committed . suicide two days after Brittney was last seen while his son, Donald Paul . Holland Jr, has been arrested in connection with the sex abuse . allegations . Linked: William Brownlee (left), a friend of the . Wood family, has also been charged, while Jennifer Moore, 32, became . the 11th arrest in the case . Crucial: Detectives believe Brittney could reveal important information about the case . When the car pulled over, . Kent took off her clothes and performed a sex act on her before raping . her as her father watched, Sgt. Scott Congleton testified. 'She kept telling him to stop. He did not,' the detective said. According to AL.com . there are at least four victims of alleged abuse. Officers claim some . of the victims were under the age of 12 when the attacks took place and . are related to those arrested. Lead . prosecutor Mobile County Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson . told the website that suspected victims have been placed in foster care . where necessary. 'This is a more layered group than we have seen or uncovered here in Mobile,' Patterson said. 'Family members sharing their children, unfortunately, is not new. It is not that unusual from what we know.' 'If you’re getting to a third generation and people are still choosing to abuse, sometimes these networks take place' 'Everybody's main interest here is to protect these kids and do the best job that we can.' 'Most . of these children are no longer with their immediate family members. They are either in foster care or with extended family.' Speaking to WKRG.com, she added: 'Pretty much everyone in this extended family was having sex with one another and having sex with the children"", . Det. Terri Hall of the Mobile County Sheriff's Office said:  'For just your . everyday person, you just can't understand how a family operates the way . they operate. You just can't. I can't even think of a word to describe . this family.' Chessie Wood has accused her deceased brother-in-law of killing Brittney. She maintains her innocence on the sex abuse charges she faces. The accused are currently awaiting trial. Under suspicion: Brittney's uncle Dustin Kent is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl while the father allegedly looked on .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline . Hayley Edwards, right, suspected her son Nathan, 14 weeks, had picked up her milk allergy . A mother who took her baby to doctors claiming he had a milk allergy was dismissed as an anxious first-time parent was days before he was taken to hospital when he started to choke. Hayley Edwards was brushed off when she tried to tell her GP that her three-week-old boy had an allergy to cow's milk, despite him being covered in rash and having swollen eyes. But when little Nathan Hudson began to choke and was rushed to hospital by ambulance it was only then that a paediatrician finally diagnosed an allergy, as well as reflux. Miss Edwards, 31, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, has now launched a campaign to see GPs better trained in spotting allergies in babies. Miss Edwards, who also suffers from a milk allergy, said: 'Nathan was covered in a rash and he had swollen, watery eyes and he was really congested. 'He was squirming in pain all the time - I knew what was wrong but nobody would listen.' The mum took Nathan, now 16 weeks, to see a doctor at Kings Medical Centre in Wakefield but was deemed anxious and nervous. His symptoms only improved after his later diagnosis by a paediatrician at Pinderfields Hospital, when he was started on a milk-free diet and medication for reflux. A lead GP at King's said: 'Even with a thriving baby such as Nathan, reflux or feeding problems can be distressing and it sometimes takes a while to get the right treatment. 'We are glad that after all the appointments and visits he is doing so much better. We would be very happy to speak directly to Nathan's mum about this.' Dr Allison Grove, consultant paediatrician at The Mid Yorkshire Hospital NHS Trust, said: 'As part of their general paediatric education and training, paediatric doctors at our hospitals are trained in spotting the symptoms of milk allergies and reflux, along with all other common conditions found in babies and children.' Miss Edwards' online petition aims to review the system doctors take dealing with babies with potential allergies or reflux, and has so far gathered 3,700 signatures. The petition can be signed at http://epetition.direct.gov.uk/petitions/68614. Some babies can develop an intolerance to cow's milk. It is the most common form of food allergy in small children but most will have grown out of it by the time they go to school. Babies with an intolerance react to an enzyme in the milk with various degrees of severity. In extreme cases the allergy can cause anaphylaxis. In most cases, babies develop diarrhoea, vomiting and stomach cramps. They can also suffer from eczema.

"By . Hilary Boyd . The truth is one I have only recently acknowledged, but I am in no doubt now that it is universal: if you have a husband, you should also get a shed. All married men need one — a place where they can do important things such as tinker with perfectly functioning bikes, read comics and drink Thermos tea (for an average of around 26 days a year, as one recent report conservatively estimated). For years, ‘heading to the shed’ has been a technique for escaping ’er indoors. But while men may have always been allowed to think it’s their idea to get a shed, I now realise it’s women who really drive the plan. Hilary Boyd is more than happy to let her husband lock himself away in the shed while she gets on with writing . Sheds, I have discovered, are essential places in which to contain a husband. And for every man who’s smugly congratulating himself on breaking out for some sneaky man time, you can bet there’s a wife breathing a huge sigh of relief at having him out from under her feet. I think I may have struck upon the cure for our soaring divorce rate which, tellingly, is particularly prolific among the over-60s — the age that retirement sets in and couples suddenly find themselves permanently, and seemingly maddeningly, rubbing shoulders under one roof. Simply make sure he has a mini, felted roof of his own. Until recently I wasn’t lucky enough to have a shed in my life. So my husband of 41 years, Don, was on the loose. And as a selfish writer who works from home, this spelt disaster. I am the sort who needs total quiet and isolation when I’m writing. I am in awe of writers who work alongside their partners. Maeve Binchy wrote side by side with her husband, Gordon, in the same room; twin typewriters next to each other. Can you imagine? Author Laurie Graham has her husband, Howard, who sadly is suffering from dementia, with her at all times. I have nothing but respect for them both. Author Maeve Binchy with husband Gordon, who she writes side by side with . Don and I used to settle ourselves at opposite ends of our one-and-a-half-bedroom flat in North London, and I still couldn’t manage it. The ‘half’ was my office, and Don — a crazy film-maker type — had an office in town where he went daily. But modern technology meant he could do a lot of his work — running an online arts website — from home. This meant the Boyd family scenario during the week went as follows: ‘Are you going into work now?’ I’d say, ever-so-casually after breakfast, at around 9am. ‘Yes,’ Don would say. ‘I’ve got a meeting at 11am.’ A t that point, I would retreat to my office and pretend to start writing. In reality, I’d be sitting waiting for sounds that he was going — the blessed shout of goodbye that meant I could start scribbling in peace. Not because he was making a noise as such, but because he was there, lurking. After a while, I’d pop back out. ‘How’s it going?’ I’d ask, nonchalantly. ‘Fine,’ he’d reply. ‘Are you off soon?’ I’d persist. Then he’d look hurt. ‘OK, OK, I’m going in a minute. I don’t see what difference it makes me being here — I’m not making a sound.’ Hilary Boyd says having her own space has helped her to be successful . And another row would ensue, me incoherently trying to explain why his silent presence was as annoying as nails on a blackboard. I’m sure anyone reading this is probably feeling sorry for Don right now. And fair enough. I was being a bit of a harridan, wanting to chuck my husband out of his own home. But I couldn’t write with him there, not in that tiny space — and it became crucial to the harmony of our relationship and ongoing success of my career that this chucking out issue got sorted. So, this year, we made the momentous decision to move out of London — where I’ve lived for more than six decades — to find somewhere bigger, more peaceful, where Don could have his own office at home. Still, at the back of my mind, I was worried. Wouldn’t it be the same as in the flat: Don in his new office, me in the next room, itching to have the house all to myself? As soon as we stepped through the door of any potential home, I immediately scanned the bedroom situation to see if there would be enough separation. And mostly there wasn’t. Then we walked into this small cottage by the coast in West Sussex, and I spied the answer to all our problems: a shed. Hallelujah! A converted garage across the small garden, already kitted out as an office, and a thousand miles away from the lovely spare bedroom — my space — in the attic. We decided to take it straight away. And here we are, four months later, settled into our new place near the sea. Don still goes up to London a couple of days a week, but the time he is at home is happily spent in our marriage-saving shed. Now and again I’ll take him a cup of tea, sometimes even make him lunch, and encourage him in his latest endeavour. All I need to do now is make sure he never, ever retires.

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . A dazzling conjunction of Jupiter and Venus will be visible on Monday morning, shortly before sunrise in the UK. A 2012 conjunction over Canada is pictured . A dazzling conjunction of Jupiter and Venus will provide an impressive light show on Sunday night and Monday morning. The two brightest planets in the sky will form a spectacular 'double star', hanging low on the north-eastern horizon. This will be visible shortly before sunrise at around 5am BST (midnight EST) and will appear only 0.2 degrees apart - less than half the width of a little finger held out at arm's length. A number of similar conjunctions were captured in 2012, but this will be the closest and brightest conjunction of the two planets since 2000. Experts believe their combined brightness and low position in the sky could keep switchboards busy with reports of UFOs. Robin Scagell, vice-president of the Society for Popular Astronomy, said: 'They will be so close together that it's going to be quite a striking sight. 'Undoubtedly people could mistake them for a UFO, especially being so low down. 'They might appear to move around because of the distortion effect of the atmosphere.' Although the planets appear to be kissing-distance apart, as seen from the Earth, they are actually separated by hundreds of millions of miles. Venus and Jupiter pair up about once a year on average, but their conjunctions vary greatly in separation and visibility. Some are missed completely because they occur in daylight. The next Venus-Jupiter conjunction is due to occur on June 30 next year, but will be less close. During Monday's conjunction, Venus will appear six times brighter than Saturn, even though its diameter is less than a tenth that of the larger planet, which measures 86,881 miles (139,821km) across. The two brightest planets in the sky will form a 'double star', hanging low on the north-eastern horizon.

'Undoubtedly people could mistake them for a UFO, especially being so low down. 'They might appear to move around because of the distortion effect of the atmosphere.' That is because Venus is much closer to the Earth and also nearer the sun, causing its clouds to be lit more intensely. A pair of binoculars will heighten the conjunction experience, but even a small telescope should provide a dramatic view. Venus will mimic a tiny full moon, while Jupiter will appear three times wider. Jupiter will also be accompanied by its four brightest moons strung out in a row. Ideally the conjunction should be seen from a high unobstructed vantage point. 'People who have buildings, hills or trees in the way might miss it, but even a roof top in London should offer a good view,' said Mr Scagell.","Jupiter and Venus will form a 'double star' on the north-eastern horizon .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A young woman told she was 'anorexic' when her weight plummeted to seven stone has recovered after having Botox injections. Jade Nock lost weight after struggling to keep any solid food down. The 25-year-old had to endure a year being fed through a tube, before eventually being diagnosed with a rare condition called gastric dysrhythmia. The illness caused Miss Nock's stomach to automatically expel any food she swallowed. Jade Nock, 25, from Walsham-le-Willows in Suffolk was told by doctors she was anorexic after suddenly losing weight when she was unable to keep food down . Miss Nock was in fact suffering gastric dysrhythmia - a condition which caused her stomach to expel food automatically. For a year she was fed through a feeding tube, left, before she was diagnosed and treated using Botox injections to 'freeze' her stomach tissue . Since her diagnosis, doctors have been able to cure her of the condition by administering twice-yearly Botox injections. The anti-wrinkle treatment works to 'freeze' the tissue in Miss Nock's stomach, allowing her to digest solid food again. Miss Nock, whose weight is now stable, said: 'I began feeling sick suddenly one night while I was out in London with friends. I went home thinking it was a stomach bug. 'My mum Ali gave me dry toast and tea, and I couldn't keep that down either. Even keeping water down was impossible.' The former maternity ward auxiliary was taken to hospital by her mother, after several days of sickness. Staff at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital put the 25-year-old on a drop to replenish her fluids. She was sent home to Walsham-le-Willows in Suffolk with the assurance that she was suffering from a passing stomach bug. But her sickness continued, resulting in her losing weight rapidly. In around three weeks she lost three stone, prompting a return to hospital in November 2008. She said: 'A doctor sat at the end of my bed and told me I must have been suffering from anorexia - that my inability to keep food down had psychological rather than physical roots. 'I was stunned, and burst into tears. I knew that it wasn't all just in my head - that there was something else going on. 'For one thing, I loved my job and was desperate to get well again so I could go back to work.' Miss Nock, who is engaged to Vincent Norton, pictured, said: 'Even keeping water down was impossible' Her mother Ali, pictured right, took Miss Nock to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital after she suffered several days of sickness. She was sent home with the assurance she was suffering a bug but the vomiting continued . Miss Nock was allowed  home under observation but returned to hospital around a month later for the traumatic experience of being fitted with a feeding tube. She said: 'It wasn't very nice. I ended up pulling one of my tubes out because I was feeling incredibly depressed by the situation. Gastric dysrhythmia is a condition that causes the stomach to automatically empty. As soon as any food enters the stomach, the condition causes a sufferer to vomit, expelling it immediately. It is connected to a similar condition gastroparesis - a neuromuscular disorder of the stomach. Gastric dysrythmias are caused when electrical signals governing the function of the stomach are disturbed, leading to nausea and vomiting. It is a broad term covering a range of illnesses. ' I was told I was allowed to eat solid food at the same time, but whenever I did the tube became dislodged when I was inevitably sick afterwards. 'I was even put on a course of anti-psychotic medication which really spaced me out. 'I began to think that the problems really were just all in my mind - after all that was anyone's best guess at the time.' The following summer, doctors concerned at Miss Nock's mounting depression booked her in for an appointment at the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where she was given a meal of scrambled eggs laced with radioactive tracer to monitor the passage of food through her body. It was then that doctors saw that her stomach was expelling food completely from her stomach. An appointment with a specialist at the Royal Free Hospital in London in January 2010 confirmed that she had gastric arrhythmia - a condition which interrupts the stomach's ability to hold and process food and liquid. She said: 'It was nice that people were listening to me after so long. I thought, ""at least something's going to get done now"". 'There were two options - have Botox to firm up the tissue in my stomach, or a pacemaker-like device in my stomach. The plan was to try the Botox first and see what happened.' After being referred to see a specialist at Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, Miss Nock was finally diagnosed with the stomach condition. She now requires Botox injections every six months to keep the illness at bay . In May 2010, surgeons gave Miss Nock, who is engaged to automotive engineer Vincent Norton, 22, her first injection through a needle mounted on a camera which was guided down her throat. She said: 'It took a few days to start working, but then when it did work, it was amazing. 'I had my first solid food - mashed potato with cheese - a week after the first injection. Having been suffering for more than a year, it was revelation to be able to digest solid food again. Shortly after that I said goodbye to the feeding tube forever.' Miss Nock's weight is now stable at seven stone but she requires Botox injections every six months to make sure that the gastric dysrhythmia does not return. She said: 'As the injections wear off I start to bring up food again which means my weight will drop off. 'I can't eat food which is too rich or creamy. I can't overeat - if I push myself, it doesn't stay down. 'I'd heard of Botox being used medically to cure bladder conditions before - but not the stomach. 'When I tell people, some people are surprised, and think that such treatment is just for cosmetic purposes. 'I was wary. I thought 'how's it going to work?' I was happy to go along with it if there was a chance it was going to be effective - and I'm so glad it was. 'I love stew and dumplings and sausage casserole - home cooking that my nan used to make. I also like chicken pie. 'I appreciate food much more now that I've been through this experience. I used to be quite fussy, but now I'm more open.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . The universe is bathed in a steady stream of ultraviolet light – but where this light comes from has long been a mystery. One theory is that light comes from quasars, which are distant objects powered by black holes a billion times as massive as our sun. But some astronomers believe that much dimmer galaxies, which are larger in number, are responsible for bathing the cosmos in light. Scroll down for video... The universe is bathed in a steady supply of ultraviolet light – but where this light comes from has long been a mystery. A computer model shows one scenario for how light is spread through the early universe on vast scales  of more than 50 million light years across . Now, new research by London-based scientists could finally solve the mystery of the UV light and understand how galaxies formed by analysing its distribution. 'Which produces more light? A country's biggest cities or its many tiny towns?' asked Dr Andrew Pontzen, lead author of the study at University College London (UCL). 'Cities are brighter, but towns are far more numerous. Understanding the balance would tell you something about the organisation of the country. 'We're posing a similar question about the universe: does ultraviolet light come from numerous but faint galaxies, or from a smaller number of very bright quasars?' One theory is that light comes from quasars, which are objects powered by black holes a billion times as massive as our sun (artists's impression pictured). Their intensity means quasars are relatively easy to spot . Answering this question will give scientists a valuable insight into the way that the universe built its galaxies – the places where stars and planets are born, live and die. It will also help researchers properly calibrate their measurements of dark energy, the mysterious force that is accelerating the universe's expansion and will determine its far future. In July, astronomers discovered an enormous deficit of ultraviolet light in the universe. Observations made by Hubble have revealed that the universe is 'missing' a large amount of light. Experts say 'something is amiss in the universe' with 80 per cent of the light missing. 'It’s as if you’re in a big, brightly lit room, but you look around and see only a few 40-watt lightbulbs,' said the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Juna Kollmeier, lead author of a new study on the missing light published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. 'Where is all that light coming from? It’s missing from our census.' The research team - which includes Benjamin Oppenheimer and Charles Danforth of CU-Boulder’s Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy - analysed the tendrils of hydrogen that bridge the vast reaches of empty space between galaxies. When hydrogen atoms are struck by highly energetic ultraviolet light, they are transformed from electrically neutral atoms to charged ions. The astronomers were surprised when they found far more hydrogen ions than could be explained with the known ultraviolet light in the universe. The difference is a stunning 400 per cent. Strangely, this mismatch only appears in the nearby, relatively well-studied cosmos. When telescopes focus on galaxies billions of light years away - which shows astronomers what was happening when the universe was young - everything seems to add up. The fact that the accounting of light needed to ionise hydrogen works in the early universe but falls apart locally has scientists puzzled. To help find the light source, astronomers use quasars as beacons. Because of their intensity, quasars are relatively easy to spot in astronomers' observations, even at distances more than 95 per cent of the way across the observable universe. 'Because they can be seen at such great distances, quasars are a useful probe for finding out the properties of the universe,' Professor Pontzen says. 'Distant quasars can be used as a backlight, and the properties of the gas between them and us are imprinted on the light.' As the light travels through the universe towards Earth, two things happen: first, the expansion of the universe causes the lights colours to become redder and wavelengths become longer. Clouds of gas absorb some very specific colours of light, progressively eating chunks out of the full spectrum. Analysing the light when it arrives at Earth allows scientists to reverse-engineer the process and so understand the intervening clouds. Doing this for a million quasars should help researcher learn a great deal about the distribution of matter, including both the gas and the galaxies and quasars that bathe the gas in radiation. If galaxies caused the light, scientists would expect the remaining dark gas to be relatively evenly-spread across the universe. If quasars did it, they would find a much less uniform distribution. The team plan to use the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey which will include detailed measurements of about a million distant quasars. Although these measurements are designed to reveal how the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to dark energy, the new research shows that results from DESI will also determine whether the intervening gas is uniformly illuminated. In turn, the measurement of patchiness will reveal whether light in our universe is generated by 'a few cities' - quasars or by 'many small towns' – or galaxies. 'It's amazing how little is known about the objects that bathed the universe in ultraviolet radiation while galaxies assembled into their present form,' says co-author Hiranya Peiris. 'This technique gives us a novel handle on the intergalactic environment during this critical time in the universe's history.' Some astronomers believe that much dimmer galaxies, which are larger in numbers, are responsible for bathing the cosmos in light.

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Hiawatha Rutland, 33, drowned after jumping from a boat into Lake Erie, Cleveland, on Sunday evening . A former Iowa state football player drowned after jumping off a boat to swim ashore with his girlfriend. Hiawatha Rutland, 33, was found dead in Lake Erie near Whiskey Island, Cleveland, on Monday afternoon. He tried to swim to shore from a private boat at around 7.30pm on Sunday, but began to flounder 90 feet from land and called out for help, according to authorities. A female friend tried to jump in and save Rutland, but nearly drowned before being pulled to safety. The Coast Guard used helicopters and boats to search for Mr Rutland, who worked as a school teacher in New York, before recovering his body. The running back played at Iowa State from 2000 to 2003 and scored nine touchdowns before a knee injury cut his career short. He is the eighth known Cyclone to have his life cut short during the coach Dan McCarney era. Mr McCarney served as head coach at Iowa State University from 1995 to 2006 and during that he time led the Cyclones to five bowl games. He said: 'Prayers go out to the family and friends of Hiawatha Rutland. People die only when we forget them, if you can remember, he will always be with us.' Cyclones coach Paul Rhoads said: 'Great Cyclone. Great human being with a monster size heart. 'I was fortunate to be here when he was recruited, fortunate to be here when he played, fortunate to be here when he's come back to this state and this university every year. 'A funny human being. Kind of guy that would do everything for his teammates. A great friend. Sad day.' In 2003, former running back Ennis Haywood died after ingesting ethanol and two drugs and three years later former quarterback Cris Love lost his bout with cancer. Fans mourned the deaths of former running back Stevie Hicks and linebacker Justin Eilers in 2008. Earlier this year, former defensive end Jason Berryman was found shot and killed. And Cyclones assistant Curtis Bray died of a pulmonary embolism in January. With Haywood, Hicks, and now Rutland's deaths, Iowa State's leading rushers from the 2000 to 2006 team have all passed away. He is the eighth known Cyclone to have his life cut short in recent years.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Naked, drawn by a robot and painted in his own blood, a Brooklyn artist may have just created the ultimate selfie. Ted Lawson's bizarre latest piece - titled 'Ghost in the Machine (blood robot selfie)' - is exactly what it says on the tin. In order to bring it to life, Mr Lawson had to connect the robot artist to a vein in his arm, via a medical tube. Scroll down for video . Blood, sweat and tears: The creation took hours of coding and a lot of Ted Lawson's blood . Finished product: Mr Lawson had to sit for hours with the robot attached to a vein in his arm while it 'painted' He wrote thousands of lines of code to direct the machine, and then sat for hours as the it sketched out his likeness, while sucking blood from his arm for the ink. 'I'm always trying to find the intersection between technology and existential human experience,' he said. 'I was trying to work out a way to program the machine to draw with a brush and ink when it occurred to me that I could hook myself up to the machine directly. Modern art: Mr Lawson is used to creating unorthodox pieces, and focuses largely on the human form . 'I've never really been a huge fan of self portraits, and was not really into putting my nude self out there, but conceptually it made sense. 'I wanted to show, in a poetic way, the connection we all have with technology and how it has permeated our inner selves in different ways.' Much of Mr Lawson's artwork is quite gruesome and features the human form. One of his pieces, titled 'Eve', is a circle of eight sculptures of a woman, starting out extremely thin and skeletal and ending up grotesquely fat. He also creates sculptures from crude oil and does paintings of abstract space scenes. His website bio reads: 'Using figurative representation and geometric abstraction, Ted Lawson creates a narrative progression of forms that reveals something conceptually greater than the sum of their parts. 'Ted’s large scale works combine digital technology with highly crafted traditional sculpting methods to seamlessly produce conceptual objects that express the underlying analog truth within his subject matter. 'His working process in an exploration into the human existential experience through imagined models of the universe as physical form.' Mr Lawson is not the only artist to recreate himself in blood. Young British Artists member Marc Quinn has made a series of sculptures of his own head made from frozen blood. He makes a new version every five years for the project, titled 'Self', with the first head being made from 4.5 litres of his own blood taken from him over five months. Charles Saatchi bought the original in 1991 for a rumoured £13,000, before selling it to an American collector for £1.5m in April 2005.","Ted Lawson creates ultimate selfie drawn by a machine in his own blood .

"By . Michael Gadd For Mailonline . The amount of money spent tax-free by foreign tourists in Britain has fallen for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009, new figures show. Experts blamed political unrest and weakened currencies in key nations for the four per cent fall year-on-year for the first six months of the year. However, Britain is far from being the only country hit by the downturn in tax-free spending by tourists. Spending down: Tax-free spending has dropped in the United Kingdom for the first time since 2009 . Global Blue, which operates 'Tax Free' services in 43 countries around the world, reported a drop in spend across all leading retail tourism destinations for the second quarter of 2014, down three per cent year-on-year overall. Gordon Clark, UK country manager for Global Blue, said: 'Our figures show that political unrest and weakened home currencies are leaving shoppers from our top spending nations in a position where they are still spending more per transaction than before but are making less purchases than they would have made in the past, resulting in the UK seeing a four per cent year-on-year reduction in the sales in store from Tax Free shopping. 'More than ever now British retailers and hotels need to review their international marketing plans, product range and staff training to ensure they still continue to secure this crucial international spend.' He said China and Middle Eastern nations have continued to lead spending in the UK, but growth has slowed. Money woes: Global Blue says tax-free spending is down across all 43 nations in which they operate . Chinese spend is up eight per cent so far this year, but much less than the 20 per cent to 50 per cent growth seen in recent years. Clark added: 'However, as economies begin to recover, we expect to see growth from key nations pick up again.' Russia has been suffering a weakening economy since the end of 2013, and with the Ukraine crisis making the situation worse, the ruble reached a record low this year. Clark said Russian shoppers visiting the UK have been left disadvantaged against sterling, resulting in a 20 per cent year-on-year drop in spend seen by Global Blue.","Experts blame political unrest and weakened currencies in key nations .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Two 'Wolves of Wall Street' funded a multi-millionaire's lifestyle by masterminding an elaborate scam which encouraged British investors to buy £60million of worthless shares. Australian Jeffrey Revel-Reade, 49, from Dursley, Gloucestershire, and Anthony May, 58, from South Norwood, south London, orchestrated the complex boiler room scam from their base in Madrid, Spain. The deception - similar to the type orchestrated by Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfont, played by Leonardo di Caprio in the Hollywood film - allowed the fraudsters to live a life of luxury, with yachts, private jets and a huge portfolio of plush mansions across the world. Jeffrey Revel-Reade, pictured left, from Dursley, Gloucestershire, and Anthony May, from South Norwood, south London, masterminded a £60m boiler room scam by encouraging British investors to buy worthless shares . The 'exceptionally talented' duo shamelessly splurged on vintage wine collections, top of the range cars and two prized Rolf Harris paintings - worth £72,970 - after duping the investors. Father-of-two Revel-Reade spent . £13,000 on Rolex watches alone, as well as £54,000 on sports cars and . motorbikes. He also . owned a $2million luxury flat in Melbourne, Australia, three apartments . in Marbella, Spain - which were worth more than 3million euros - and had four mansions . in Wimbledon, south west London, including one worth £5million. After a three-month trial at Southwark Crown Court, Revel-Reade and May were jailed for nine years and six months and seven years six months respectively for conspiracy to defraud. During the trial, the jury heard how the pair executed the scam by enlisting a team of salesmen who used high pressure sales techniques to trick vulnerable victims. Last year six of those salesmen were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and jailed almost 30 years in total. The scam was similar to the type orchestrated by Jordan Belfont, played by Leonardo di Caprio in the Wolf of Wall Street . Their convictions can now be revealed after reporting restrictions were lifted. All six defendants, who persuaded the punters to invest, were convicted of conspiring to . defraud investors by dishonestly making, causing or permitting false . representations between March 2003 and August 2007. The court was told one of the victims, veteran Roger Carr, has been left 'isolated' after the hoax and now only has his 'small army pension' on which to survive. Another victim Rosemary Howard invested her £200,000 life sayings in the fraudulent scheme to try and fund care for her elderly disabled mother - who is in her 90s and wheelchair bound. During the latest trial, judge Michael Gledhill QC said the effects the scam had on the victims were 'catastrophic'. He told them: 'The investors' losses amounted to many millions of dollars. 'Most of those investors have lost every penny. The consequences for all of them, both financially and psychologically, have been dreadful and in some cases catastrophic. 'The salesman were very successful in pressuring investors to buy these shares by using a combination of devices - lying, making false representations, using high pressure sales techniques, befriending those who were elderly or vulnerable through loneliness and making threats and bullying.' Judge Gledhill described them as intelligent and 'exceptionally talented' men. The pair spent their money on luxury items, such as private jets, mansions around the world and designer clothes and goods . He said: 'You are both men with . exceptional talents, highly intelligent and astute, both capable of . making a large amount of money from hard work but unfortunately you . decided there was far more money to be made from fraud. Revel-Reade was extradited from Australia while May was brought back from Spain to face criminal proceedings. Revell-Reade splurged £13,000 on Rolex watches, as well as £54,000 on sports cars . A third defendant, solicitor John . Manning, 65, was allegedly recruited to provide a 'veneer of . respectability', but was cleared of corruption. Prosecutor Stuart Trimmer QC said: 'This was grand deception on a global scale. 'Simply, this was greed on a vast scale, dressed up in the language of business, hidden behind layers of corporate disguise. 'The investors were told, whatever it took to persuade them, to buy the shares that the conspirators had on the shelf to sell. 'They were not stockbrokers but they set up an elaborate facade that looked and sounded, to the would-be investor, like real professional stockbrokers. 'Their purpose was, in reality, not to provide a service but to sell their ""stock"" and simply to make as much money as possible.' Revel-Reade was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud but cleared of another charge of corruption. May, a father-of-two whose family lives in Switzerland, was convicted of conspiracy to defraud. Manning, from Alwoodley, Leeds, West Yorksire, was acquitted of corruption. Judge Gledhill continued: 'Everyone involved in this fraud made a great deal of money. The two men were jailed collectively for 17 years after a trial at Southwark Crown Court . 'Madrid salesmen enjoyed a luxury lifestyle driving top of the range vehicles, expensive holidays and investing in property. 'From your proceeds you invested substantial amounts to be put to your wife and children's school fees and provide goods. 'You were able to rent and own properties in England, Spain and Austria. You had ready money to travel the world.' From the previous case, the defendants were Daniel Gooding, 39, and Emma . Farmer, 40, both from Brentwood, Essex; Jon Emery, 36, from Romford, Essex; Ian Hughes, 33, from Cardiff; Philip Morris, from Ashford, Kent and Shaun . Rumsey, 33, from Dunmow, Essex. Gooding was jailed for seven years, while Rumsey, Emery and Morris received a five-year jail term. Hughes was locked up for four years, while Farmer was handed a three-year prison term.","Jeffrey Revel-Reade, 49, from Gloucestershire and Anthony May, 58, from London, masterminded the scam from their base in Madrid, Spain .

"By . Helen Pow . The real Wolf of Wall Street has admitted he lost his soul 'as much as a person can and still be walking around' in the midst of his wheeling and dealing and debauched life of 90's excess. Jordan Belfort, who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Oscar-nominated film, described in a Monday night interview the moment he learned he was selling a scam, cheating innocent people out of millions of dollars of savings. 'It was about a month in when I realized. That was the first moment where I allowed greed to get the better of me,' he told Piers Morgan Live. Scroll down for video . Soulless: The real Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, pictured Monday night, has admitted he lost his soul 'as much as a person can and still be walking around' in the midst of his wheeling and dealing and debauched life of 90's excess . Belfort, 51, who is now a motivational speaker, applauded the movie, and said he spent more than 100 hours with DiCaprio, helping him prepare for the role of his life. He praised the actor for making the film what he calls a cautionary tale rather than glorifying the excessive behavior, as many critics have claimed the film does. 'Originally when Leo saw this project, he wanted to get it on screen – and he said this publicly – because it represented the mistakes that I made, and the attitude I had at the time, represents a lot of what went really wrong ultimately, many years later with Wall Street,' he told Piers. 'It was important to him, and I think . that - what impressed Leo, I think about my new life so much, is he saw . me make this really radical turn, and I think that moved him. And I was . really proud and shocked that he did that.' According to Belfort, he and his associates at the time didn't lose their souls all at once - the decline happened bit by bit. Turn around: The man, right, who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Oscar-nominated film, described his life and the movie in the interview with Piers Morgan, left . 'What happens when you get to this section of Wall Street is it's very easy to rationalize everything you do one action at a time and then it goes further and further,' he said. The man who spent 22 months in prison for securities fraud and money laundering insisted to Piers that 95 per cent of what he did was legal but he added 'the 5 per cent was incredibly destructive and it poisoned everything.' Those moments were hard to watch in Scorsese's three hour epic, he confessed. 'It was shocking ... I saw the movie with my fiancee the first time, and we were speechless afterwards,' he said. 'I . had come to terms with my old life. I wrote this book, and that was . like a cathartic experience for me. But to see it on film like that, . with someone that did such a good job, I literally, I felt myself . sweating at certain points, when some of the cocaine was being snorted. I . got almost sympathetic reactions to it.' Belfort . then saw the movie again with his 18-year-old son and his ex-wife, who . he is shown punching in the stomach in the movie - something he claims . didn't happen in real life. Hard to watch: Jordan Belfort attended 'The Wolf of Wall Street' film premiere in December with his partner . Certain larger-than-life things that did take place, however, include a scene where a woman shaves her head for $10,000, which she used to pay for breast implants, and another where stock brokers are throwing a dwarf at a dart board in the office. Belfort's pal really did eat a live goldfish and there was a 'sex-free zone' in the promiscuous workplace. 'It started with the elevator, someone christened the elevator early on,' he explained. 'There were all these young guys and girls, 18-23, and everyone's making a lot of money. These things do happen.' The most outrageous thing he ever witnessed happened at his bachelor party, Belfort told Piers, but didn't elaborate. 'I can't say it on TV. It was an act . of sexual depravity that made even me speechless,' he said. 'It happened . in front of a crowd of 100 people, there were 50 prostitutes there and . they said it was the most depraved thing they ever saw. It was . absolutely disgusting.' Belfort told Piers his lowest moment though was when his family fell apart. Hard: Some moments were hard to watch in Scorsese's three hour epic, pictured, Belfort confessed . 'My marriage unwound and the thought of losing my children was the bottom,' he said. Thankfully, his kids were young enough when he quit his addictions that they only know him as the man he is today, he said. 'I was an amazing father and I was proud of that. I got sober when my daughter was 3 and my son was 1,' he said. He added that his parents never judged him and always showed him unconditional support despite his criminal behavior. When Piers noted that if Belfort had stayed legitimate, the hardworking salesman would have been worth a fortune today, he responded: 'That's the shame of it all. The biggest mistake I made was not delaying my gratification, I would have been worth $10-20 billion now.' Belfort reportedly owed some $110 . million to the victims of his scam. But he said he's paid back around . $12 million of his debt and is giving 100 per cent of cash made from the . book sales and the movie to the compensation fund. 'I think it'll be many, many millions of dollars and I'm really happy about that,' he told Piers. Caution: He praised DiCaprio, pictured in the movie, for making the film what he calls a cautionary tale rather than glorifying the excessive behavior, as many critics have claimed the film does . According to CNN, the film based upon his life has already grossed more than $91 million since opening a month ago. During the hour-long interview, the host listed some of the people impacted by the behavior that landed Belfort in prison - Peter Springfield, an architect in Mystic, Connecticut, who lost half of his life savings, Dr. Alfred Vitt, a retired dentist, who lost $250,000 and Bob Shearin, who reportedly lost $130,000. But Belfort said he hadn't met with any of his victims. 'I have not ... no one has sought me out,' he said. 'What I'm doing here, by turning over 100 percent of the profits, is probably the most genuine thing I can do. Honestly I feel terrible about what happened. You asked if I had shame: back then, yes. Now, no. I'm not going to live my life in shame. I think that's a toxic emotion. 'I live with remorse, and that means I go out and do things actively to make up for the wrongs that I committed in the past.' But the former Wolf said he was open to meeting some of the people he swindled in a bid to make amends.","Jordan Belfort, who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, described in a Monday night interview the moment he learned he was selling a scam, cheating innocent people out of millions of dollars .

"By . Anucyia Victor For Mailonline . For any young boy, saying farewell to their dad is always a touching moment. And for eight-year-old Ethan May, it was no different - as he hugs Gary goodbye at Gatwick airport en route to a business trip to the Middle East. However, the tears of sadness soon turn to tears of joy for the boy - as his 41-year-old father reveals he plans to take his son and his partner Claire on holiday instead. Tearful moment: Gary hugs Ethan goodbye - before telling his son he's going on a family holiday . Gary, from the New Forest, and Claire - who filmed the two-minute footage on her mobile phone - had planned the prank as a surprise for Ethan. The video, which was posted on Monarch Airlines' Facebook page and has been viewed more than 35,000 times, shows father and son hugging and crying in Gatwick airport car park. Gary asks Ethan: 'Why don't you come with?' Family holiday! Ethan, Gary and Claire on the flight to Egypt after surprising the eight-year-old . To which his son replies that he doesn't have his passport or any clothes. Gary opens the boot of their car and gets out two suitcases, saying: 'This is Claire's ... and this is yours.' At that point, Ethan starts crying again - this time tears of happiness. 'It was the best surprise ever!' he says. The family flew to Sharm el-Sheikh on Monarch Airlines, where they spent a week at Sentido Reef Oasis Senses Resort. Gary told MailOnline Travel: 'We planned this quite quickly as I was due to fly to the Middle East for business. Holiday fun: Ethan jumps into the swimming pool on his surprise family holiday to Egypt . 'But the client rescheduled the meeting just three days before this video was taken. 'We didn't think we were going to get a holiday this year and then suddenly this week in July appeared. 'We decided, with great difficulty, to keep it from Ethan.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Council workers are being told to own up about any office romances or affairs as part of a new code of conduct requiring them to confess 'close personal relationships' to their bosses. Employees of Ipswich Borough Council in Suffolk have been told to discretely let their line manager know of any trysts or other 'close relationships' after a new code of conduct was brought in. The fresh set of rules was designed to combat 'conflicts of interest' at the local authority, and to give 'very clear details of what is and is not acceptable'. Confess: Workers At Ipswich Borough Council have been told to reveal 'close personal relationships' to their bosses (posed by models) The code, introduced in March, even extends to people who do not work for the council, but do business with it in some other way. However, the change has sparked concerns that the authority could end up prying into the personal lives of staff. Employment lawyer Julie Temple from Ipswich-based Quantrills, said staff codes of conduct are common, but could later land the council in legal trouble. She said: 'I can see what the council is trying to do by introducing this code of conduct and I can understand that they see it as necessary. 'However I think it is almost certain that someone somewhere will challenge a code like this under human rights legislation.' But the council denies claims of snooping and says the code only applies when there is a risk of a conflict of interest arising. Council leader David Ellesmere insisted the rules are merely a matter of 'common sense'. Crackdown: Ipswich Borough Council brought in the tighter rules to combat 'conflicts of interest' He said: 'This is really in place to protect our staff against claims that they might show favour to someone they are close to - it is really a matter of common sense. 'It is something that is fairly common. We are not banning relationships - but we need to know if they are going to impact on council business'. The new code states: 'Employees must declare any Close Personal Relationship with another employee of the Council where the relationship could cause, or be perceived to cause, a conflict of interest'. 'In such instances there may be a need to consider alternative employment for one of the employees concerned'. Ipswich council recently pledged to tighten up its staff rules after a report recommended a more stringent code of conduct. It said the new 'rules-based' code would make it easier to 'monitor compliance' and would give 'very clear details of what is and is not acceptable'. A council spokesman said: 'The code only requires employees to disclose, in confidence, to their line manager any close personal relationships where there is a risk of a conflict of interest arising. 'Examples where an employee would be expected to disclose a close personal relationship include cases where an employee’s spouse or partner is the managing director of a company bidding for a council contract. 'Internally the code would be applied where two employees who both work for the council are in a close relationship and one is responsible for managing the other or could be involved in selection for promotion or redundancy'. Suzanne Williams, Ipswich representative for Unison, said the union was consulted on the changes to the new code of conduct and she has received no complaints.","Workers at Ipswich Borough Council in Suffolk told to confess to bosses .

"By . Martin Robinson . Three Scotland Yard officers jailed for dealing drugs could have their convictions overturned in a new undercover policing scandal, it was revealed today. Derek Haslam, an officer who infiltrated South London's criminal underworld, is alleged to have befriended the corrupt detectives to pass back information to the Met before their 2000 trial. The Court of Appeal in London heard yesterday that Mr Haslam was the Yard's 'spy in the defence camp' after he befriended Tom Kingston, Tom Reynolds and Terry O'Connell. The trio were found guilty of a conspiracy to supply £7,500 of the drug speed in 2000 but their QC has said their convictions may be unlawful because the Met carried out a 'fundamental abuse of the process of the court'. Corruption: In 2000 DC Tom Kingston was found . guilty of being part of the Groovy Gang drugs ring along with colleague . DC Tom Reynolds, and Terry O'Connell (left to right) but they now want their . convictions overturned . At the time . of their convictions it was branded the biggest corruption scandal to . hit the Metropolitan Police in 30 years but judges will now consider . whether it was 'unsafe'. Undercover cop: Derek Haslam, whose face has been covered for legal reasons, has called the allegations about him 'absolute garbage' According . to the Independent the court heard yesterday Haslam allegedly visited . one of the suspects in a Sussex prison ahead of his trial and took . defence material, before photocopying it and handing it to the Met. Representing the convicted police officers - who were part of the 'Groovy Gang' drug dealing ring - Alun Jones QC said: 'We have material that raises reasonable grounds to believe that the Met . police appointed a spy called Derek Haslam to . befriend Mr Kingston when he was preparing his defence, in order to . report back to police. 'There are grounds to believe that (anti-corruption command) used Mr Haslam as a spy in the defence camp to . see privileged material, that would be a fundamental abuse of the . process of the court.' Mr Haslam, who says he fears for his life because he was unmasked as an undercover operative, told the Independent the claims were 'absolute garbage. Complete and utter twaddle.' It came just months after it emerged a police spy passed on confidential details about the breakdown of Neville and Doreen Lawrence’s marriage to Scotland Yard bosses. The undercover officer sent reports of how the couple ‘had, in reality, separated’ during the Macpherson inquiry into their son Stephen’s racist murder. In one, he made it clear that the collapse of the couple’s marriage ‘is not public knowledge’. Details of the astonishing intrusion of privacy are contained in the Ellison review into the Stephen Lawrence case. In the new case Mr Jones QC also questioned the evidence of Neil Putnam - a police officer turned  'supergrass' who made a series of claims linked to the Stephen Lawrence investigation and how an officer had links to the father of one of his killers. His evidence was central to the convictions of the three men. Intrusion: In March it emerged an undercover police officer passed . on details about the breakdown of Doreen and Neville Lawrence's marriage . to bosses at Scotland Yard . Evidence: The Crown says evidence from the Met used to convict the three me is 'safe' The Met 'suppressed' some of Putnam's evidence from Sir William Macpherson's inquiry into the first botched investigation which means the Met the CPS no longer saw him as a 'witness of truth', Mr Jones said. Crispin Aylett QC, for the Crown, said Putnam could still be trusted despite his dispute with Scotland Yard over the Lawrence case. The judges have reserved their decision on the case until a later date.","Tom Kingston, Tom Reynolds and Terry O'Connell jailed for dealing drugs .

"By . Leon Watson . A British man who saved hundreds of Jewish children from the Holocaust is to be given the highest honour of the Czech Republic. Sir Nicholas Winton, who celebrated his 105th birthday last week, organised the transport of 669 children – mostly Jewish – from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. Independently of Operation Kindertransport, which did not include the children of Czechoslovakia, he ensured that over the course of nine months before the Second World War broke out in September 1939 they made their way to Britain. Sir Nicholas Winton, organised the transport of 669 children - mostly Jewish - from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, at the Czech Embassy in London . Highest honour: Sir Nicholas Winton with one of the children he rescued . The ceremony held at the Czech Embassy for Sir Nicholas Winton . Sir Nicholas enjoyed his birthday party with a smile on his face and showed no signs of fatigue despite the never ending attention of almost one hundred well-wishers . Most of the children's families ended up being sent to Nazi concentration and death camps and were murdered during the Holocaust. The . decision to grant Sir Nicholas the Order of the White Lion was announced by . the Czech ambassador, Michael Zantovsky, at an event in London to mark . his birthday. It also follows the launch of a biography written by his daughter, Barbara Winton. In . a letter to the former stockbroker, the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, . said: 'You gave these children the greatest possible gift: the chance to . live and to be free. 'But . you did not think of yourself as a hero because you were conducted by a . desire to help those who could not defend themselves, those who were . vulnerable. 'Your life is an example of humanity, selflessness, personal courage and modesty.' Sir Nicholas was presented with a beautiful home-made birthday cake with 105 candles and a bouquet of flowers . After the war, Winton married, cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly . Sir Nicholas Winton signing a copy of a new book about his life called If It's Not Impossible written by his daughter Barbara Winton . Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman wrote a letter of thanks to Sir Nicholas . Dear Sir Nicholas Winton,By means of this letter I would like to congratulate you on your important jubilee that you are celebrating today. I would like to convey greetings and congratulations to you from the capital of a country where people remember your name in relation to an extraordinary heroic deed that arouses respect, esteem and gratitude across the generations. That is why I write to you, not only on my behalf but on behalf of many of my fellow citizens.History is made up of people's stories and their often complex fates. It is especially those who did not originally intend to become famous and did not see their deeds as exceptional who usually make their mark in history and are remembered. Such people only did what they considered to be the right thing, to the best of their knowledge and belief. They did not think about what such behaviour would bring them or whether it would make them famous. And this is exactly what makes them heroes who are so much needed by each chapter of human history, if it is to serve as a lesson and inspiration for others.On the verge of World War II, disregarding the danger to yourself, your personal commitment helped to save 669 Czechoslovak children, mainly Jewish, who would otherwise have faced prison, war hardships and often death. You gave then the greatest gift you could give them: the possibility to live and be free. However, you did not consider yourself to be a hero and the motive for what you did was your desire to help those who could not defend themselves and were vulnerable. Only many years after did the world learn about your heroism, which was and still is most greatly appreciated by the gratefulness of those whom you have saved.Sir Nicholas, your life story is exceptional for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it is a role model of humanity, unselfishness, personal courage and humbleness. That is why I have decided to confer upon you on the occasion of our National Holiday on 28th October this year, the Order of the White Lion, the highest decoration of the Czech Republic. I would hereby like to invite you to Prague where I would like to confer upon you this decoration in person.I would like to wish you all the best, good health, a lot of personal happiness and vitality. And allow me to wish us all to have the strength to draw inspiration from such life stories as yours, for without them there would be no hope for human history.Kind regards,Miloš Zeman . Recognized: He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2002 (pictured) and has been the subject of a film. Next month, his daughter is releasing a book about her father . The Daily Telegraph reported that at the reception in the Czech embassy Sir Nicholas said: 'I am always surprised every time I come here to see all . kinds of people who have come really very great distances to say hello. 'As . far as I am concerned, it is only anno Domini that I am fighting – I am . not ill, I am just old and doddery. And I am more doddery than old.' It was . 1938 and violence was escalating against Jewish people in Europe when Sir Nicholas, then just 29, travelled to Prague on holiday. Unassuming: Winton was 29 when he went to Prague and made a list of children to be saved . As . the Nazis marched into Czechoslovakia, Sir Nicholas - who had no experience . or connections in this sort of work - decided that he would see if he could save people. He . had actually booked a holiday to go skiing in Switzerland, but changed . his plans at the last minute when a friend involved in Jewish refugee . work asked him for help. In a special interview with CBS' 60 Minutes last week, he said: 'All . I knew was that the people that I met couldn't get out. 'And . they were looking of ways of at least getting their children out... I . work on the motto that if something's not impossible, there must be a . way of doing it.' When he . returned to London, he had lists of hundreds of children and started trying to . convince the British authorities to take them. The stockbroker pretended to be more official than he was by taking stationery from an . established refugee organization, adding 'Children's Section' to its . header and making himself chairman, CBS reported. He . admitted it took 'a little smoke and mirrors' to convince authorities . to believe him - but he said it mostly took getting a printing press to . print the paper. He . continued his work as a stockbroker by day, before returning to the . office to work on getting the children to the UK. His mother and . volunteers also helped at the office. Sir Nicholas said he contacted American authorities to take the children, but they said they were unable. But . British authorities said they would take them if Winton found each one a . home, so he got to work advertising their pictures so that families . would take them. When . he had secured them homes, the youngsters were ready to leave - but he . found that the British authorities were slow to issue their travel . documents. Desperate to help the children get out, he forged their documents and also paid off officials, he said. 'Took a bit of blackmail on my part,' he admitted. 'It worked. That's the main thing.' The first children left Prague on March 14, 1939 - just hours before German troops occupied Prague. Eventually, . seven trains carried more than 600 children to Holland, where they . caught ferries to England. The Nazis allowed them to leave, happy that . the country was being 'cleansed' of Jews. Saved: Among the children saved were 14-year-old Alice Eberstark, left, and 10-year-old Hugo Meisl, right . Thankful: Alice, who now lives in Bethesda, Maryland, said she only heard Winton's name after 50 years . Survivor: Meisl said he was always hopeful that he would return home and find his parents . On December 2, 1938, Jewish and Christian agencies began rescuing German and Austrian . Jewish children on Kindertransporten (children's transports). The Refugee Children's Movement, a group under the auspices . of the Central British Fund for German Jewry or CBF, which later became . the World Jewish Relief organisation, urged concerned Christians . and Jews to support Operation Kindertransport. An extensive . fund-raising effort was organized and the British public . responded generously, raising £500,000 in six . months. A large portion of this money was used to care for the children . who were rescued. Between December 1938 and May 1940, almost 10,000 . children, infants to teenagers, were rescued and given shelter at farms, . hostels, camps, and in private homes in Britain. However, this effort . did not include the children of Czechoslovakia; and this is why the . work of Nicholas Winton was so vital. Another train was scheduled to leave on September 1, but was stopped by the declaration of war. Sir Nicholas said he has reason to suspect not many of those children survived. At . the reception in the Czech embassy Sir Nicholas said: 'I am always surprised . every time I come here to see all kinds of people who have come really . very great distances to say hello. 'As . far as I am concerned, it is only anno Domini that I am fighting – I am . not ill, I am just old and doddery. And I am more doddery than old.' After the war, Sir Nicholas trained pilots for . the Royal Air Force, married, raised a family and lived comfortably. He . cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly. But he hardly told anyone about what he had done. But in . 1988, his wife Grete found a scrapbook in their attic listing the names . of the children, their parents and the families that had taken them. Later that year, the BBC learned about the story and Sir Nicholas was invited onto its That's Life show, where he met scores of the children he had saved. In . 2002, he was knighted, and he was also celebrated in a documentary . called 'Nicky's Family'. Found: A letter dated 1939 and written to President Franklin D. Roosevelt has been found in the National Archives. It asks the U.S. for help granting refuge to European children . Plea: It is signed by Sir Nicholas Winton - then a young London stockbroker who made it his mission to save children . Questions: Archives show that the letter was passed on to U.S. officials for a decision on what to do . Inquiries: The archivist found a letter to the President's Advisory Committee on Political Refugees .","Sir Nicholas Winton  organised the transport of 669 children to the UK .

"By . Rebecca Brett for MailOnline . It is not a place you usually expect to see sandcastles, but Gatwick Airport has unveiled two giant sand sculptures in its terminals. Created by renowned artist Zeus, the giant works are a celebration of the airport's expanded route network and depict New York's Chrysler Building and Dubai's sail-shaped, seven-star Burj Al Arab hotel. Standing at six feet six inches tall, the sculptures celebrate the launch of Norwegian's new services to New York and Emirates' A380 flights to Dubai. Standing over two metres high, the New York sand sculpture of the Chrysler Building stands tall while Catherine Stobbs, Phil Mennel and nine-year-old Theo Mackintosh walk by . The works of art, which will be displayed for two months at the airport, will be viewed by around 7.5 million passengers expected to pass through Gatwick's terminals during the period. Insights gathered from Gatwick's Airport Passenger Panel, an independent body set up to highlight potential improvements to the airport passenger experience, highlighted that UK airports needed more 'heart and soul'. As a result, over the last few years Gatwick has invested in brightening its spaces and building its contemporary art collection. Dad Dale Anderton and sons Andrew, 10, and James, 7, walk past the sand sculpture replica of Dubai's Burj Al Arab at Gatwick airport . In 2012, a 12-piece collection by the 'godfather of British pop art' Sir Peter Blake was installed across both Gatwick terminals offering passengers a warm, British welcome to the capital. Last year, 'The People's Monarch' artwork was also installed, a single piece the size of a double decker bus, depicting the Queen but made up of 5,500 images of the people of South East England. 'Gatwick has invested over £1 billion in improving facilities and the airport experience in recent years,' said Spencer Sheen, head of retail at Gatwick airport. 'This transformation means more people and airlines than ever before are choosing to fly from Gatwick and many new routes are being opened. Reach for the sky-scraper: Little Theo Mackintosh, 9, is dwarfed by the Chrysler Building sand sculpture . Emirates flight attendants Lisa Leesmith (l) and Jo Bew standing next to the Burj Al Arab sand sculpture . 'This latest addition to the airport's collection of artwork, creatively brings to life that Gatwick is now a world-class airport, serving over 200 destinations across the globe for both leisure and business travellers.' Zeus, the artist for the two new sculptures, said: 'I am delighted that these two urban sculptures will be exhibited at London Gatwick, the inspiration for which was taken from two of the flagship cities Gatwick flies to – New York and Dubai. 'Airports are symbols of modern metropolises like London, so what better place to display the works where millions of passengers can see them. 'My aim is to give people passing through Gatwick's terminals a place to reflect before they travel and when they return home to London.'","Artist Zeus was commissioned to make the two sculptures .

"By . Ray Massey . End of the road: The car tax disc which has been displayed on car windscreens for 90 years could be scrapped . The car tax disc which has adorned windscreens for more than 90 years could be due for the axe. Ministers say scrapping the paper discs would cut costs and streamline services to motorists. They are currently displayed on around 36million vehicles as proof that road tax has been paid. However, the discs could become the latest victim of the digital revolution. Officials say that because police can tell instantly from access to the DVLA computer whether a car has been taxed or not, there is no longer a need for proof on the windscreen. Even tax disc reminders may soon come as emails or texts rather than paperwork through the post. The paper element of the driving licence – which accompanies the credit card size photo-card – is also due for the chop by 2015. Motoring groups said scrapping the tax disc would mark ‘the end of a motoring era’ and would divide opinion among the UK’s 44million drivers, as well as the police. The plan is set out in the small print of a Government consultation paper published yesterday by the Department for Transport. It is looking into reforming the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, the Driving Standards Agency, the Vehicle Certification Agency and the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency. The report from Roads Minister Stephen Hammond says: ‘We will remove the need for unnecessary paper, including abolishing the driving licence counterpart and consider the continuing need for the tax disc.’ The paper element of the driving licence - which accompanies the photo card - is also due to be axed . It marks a potential U-turn by the Government which only recently – on its own ‘Better Regulation’ website which seeks cost-cutting ideas from voters – rejected the idea of scrapping the disc. It concluded: ‘The police strongly support the Department’s view that display of a tax disc should remain a legal requirement.’ But now, with money tight, abolition is back on the agenda. AA president Edmund King said ‘traditionalists will mourn the tax disc’s passing’ but he added: ‘Motoring and vehicle information is increasingly going online. ‘The police use number-plate reading camera technology to check car details on their own or on the DVLA’s database.’","Police can tell from access to DVLA computer whether car has been taxed .

"By . Emily Payne for MailOnline . British airline Monarch may be about to ditch all its long-haul flights, in a bid to compete with low-cost airlines Ryanair and easyJet. In what it has called a 'strategic review', the carrier is retiring three Boeing 757s this autumn and looking to replace its whole fleet in the next five years, after admitting passenger demand was 'flat'. The overhaul, which will see the carrier concentrating on scheduled short-haul flights to Europe, may lead to slashing 1,000 jobs in a reduction of its workforce by a third. Scroll down for video . Total overhaul: Monarch are conducting a 'strategic review' after admitting passenger demand was 'flat' The company has not officially announced the cuts, but sources have revealed the plans to the BBC. It currently operates 34 flights a week from Luton airport to nine destinations, mainly in and around the Mediterranean.Monarch . The review could mean a smaller fleet and the end of long-haul flying. Last month, the airline confirmed a £1.75bn order for 30 new Boeing 737 aircraft to be delivered by 2020. This may mean a reduction in the size of its fleet from 42 to 30 aircraft. Andrew Swaffield, who took over as Monarch chief executive in July, said: 'We're on a trajectory of changing from a charter airline to a scheduled European low-cost carrier. All change: The airline are retiring three Boeing 757s  and will have replaced its whole fleet in the next five years . 'We need to operate as efficiently as a low-cost carrier,' he said in an interview with Travel Weekly. 'It's difficult to run a long-haul business with two aircraft.' The move towards short-haul airline is expected to take place within the next year to 18 months. Earlier in August, Monarch announced it will stop flying from East Midlands Airport next year. A spokesman for Monarch MailOnline Travel: 'The company has previously stated that the new management team is conducting a strategic review of the group's businesses, in relation to its operations, ownership and financing. That review is on-going and further announcements will be made upon its conclusion or as otherwise appropriate.'","Airline has said it is undergoing a 'strategic review'

"Harry Reid, the Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate, apologized on Friday after video surfaced of him cracking two jokes about Asian-American stereotypes while speaking to the Asian Chamber of Commerce in Las Vegas.

'I don't think you're smarter than anybody else, but you've convinced a lot of us you are.'

And, Reid reportedly continued, Obama spoke 'with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.' Reid's apology for that remark, delivered after the book's publication, was more of a deep bow. 'I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words,' he said. 'I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans for my improper comments.' 'No negro dialect': Reid put his foot in his mouth during the 2008 campaign season, explaining why he though Barack Obama's race would help him win the presidency . The Las Vegas Review-Journal noted on Friday that Asian-Americans make up about 7.7 percent of Nevada’s population, a number twice what it was a decade ago. The Breitbart.com website reported Friday that a spokesman for the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus – a group composed exclusively of Democrats – declined to criticize Reid. The group's website says it will 'denounce' any 'racial and religious discrimination affecting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.' During the 2010 midterm campaign season, Reid told an audience comprised mainly of Hispanic voters that 'I don't know how anyone of Hispanic heritage could be a Republican.' His office never blasted out an apology for that remark. He has been a U.S. senator since 1987 and a member of Congress since 1983. His next appointment with an re-election calendar will come in 2016.","Reid told the Asian Chamber of Commerce in Las Vegas that 'I don't think you're smarter than anybody else, but you've convinced a lot of us you are'
He later joked that he was having 'trouble keeping my Wongs straight' among the 100 attendees of his speaking event .
Reid previously caught flak for saying Barack Obama could win the presidency because he was 'light-skinned' and had 'no negro dialect'
In 2010 he told a group of Hispanic voters that he couldn't understand how any of them could possibly be Republicans ."
"By . Bianca London . While most women dream of a traditional all white wedding, one long-suffering bride was given a black and yellow themed wedding - based on the the colour scheme of her husband-to-be's favourite power tool brand. Carpenter John Jones, 28, is obsessed with DeWalt drills, saws and sanders which are made only in black and yellow. And when John proposed to sweetheart Kelly Williams he came up with the ultimate DIY wedding - to show her the power of love. Team colours: Kelly Williams was given a black and yellow themed wedding, in honour of the colour of her new husband John Jones' favourite power tool brand . John, his best man and three groomsmen wore black with yellow ties. The two bridesmaids donned bright yellow dresses and the £400 wedding cake was in black and yellow tiers with marzipan models of John and Kelly on the top. The 150 guests sat down for the wedding reception in a hall decked out in none other than black and yellow, and they all went home with black and yellow carpenter's measuring tapes as wedding gifts. Kelly, 27, gave her approval to John's power tool wedding day but stuck to her guns and wore a traditional white gown. She said: 'He's mad about just one brand of power tools, he has been since the day I met him. 'When he came up with the idea I wasn't too happy - black and yellow are not really traditional for a wedding. Original: The 150 guests sat down for the wedding reception in a hall decked out in black and yellow and the cake was made in his favourite colours too . 'But my chief bridesmaid said it would look original so I told him to go ahead. 'But I put my foot down when it came to my dress - that's where I drew the line.' John's obsession started on his first day as an apprentice carpenter when he bought a set of DeWalt tools. He has since set up his own carpentry business and wears a black and yellow uniform in his black and yellow van. Easygoing: Kelly let her husband go along with the strange theme but drew a line at her wedding dress and opting for traditional white . He said: 'Some people wear their favourite football team's colours but I wear the colours of my favourite power tools. 'Kelly was not sure about a black and yellow wedding but I think we all looked great although I'm glad she wore white.' The couple, from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, have an eight-month-old baby Jessica whose pram is - you've guessed it - black and yellow. A spokesman for DeWalt said: 'It is fair to say John is our biggest fan.'

"By . Katy Winter . Elle Kaye is unusual even within the world of taxidermy, perhaps not only because she is a young attractive woman, but because she chooses to eat the animals she works with before stuffing them. The 22-year-old, from Hertfordshire, makes bespoke designs from roadkill or animals that have died through other means, and attempts to eat as much as possible of an animal, as long as the meat is fresh enough. The former art student, who studied fine art at Loughborough University, says this decision is based on wanting to recycle and minimise waste, and happily tucks in to a diet more akin to that of a medieval lord than a modern woman. Scroll down for video . While she creates stunning designs herself and on commission- from imposing peacocks to mouse ornaments and bird based fashion pieces- Elle also teaches taxidermy classes . Elle with two of her exhibition pieces made using mice: Left the mouse bouquet and right the chess set . Speaking to the MailOnline Elle explains: ‘For me it is a lifestyle choice. Doing what I do ensures I recycle a deceased animal, as a meat eater, there is no logic in wasting perfectly edible meat. ‘It is important to me, because it upholds all of the notions that underpin taxidermy, and it means that I do the animal justice in recycling all of it.’ With pheasant, rabbit, wood pigeon, squirrel, and deer all regularly on the menu and her workbench, Elle is unsurprisingly regularly the target of hate and abuse from people who disagree with her practice. She has received abuse online with people saying she deserves to ‘go to hell’ and threatening to ‘cut her up’. Video courtesy of Elle Kaye . Elle, pictured putting the final touches on one of her creations, has received abuse online for her work but stresses ethical considerations are her top priority . Elle studied Fine Art at Loughborough University before beginning her unusual career . One of Elle's creations, which she mainly sources from road kill, farmers and aviculturists . But despite this, Elle has not been deterred from her passion. ‘I am lucky to have a close network of people around me who support what I do, which has helped to give me the confidence to excel in what I do and push myself. ‘I have had animal rights activists, vegans, vets and animal lovers take my classes and they have all been really complimentary about the steps I take to ensure the most virtuous and human preservation is being carried out.’ But Elle is keen to point out she is extremely conscious of ethics when it comes to her work. Speaking to the MailOnline Elle says: ‘Taxidermy combines my interests in biology, animal science and conservation. It allows me to experience the fascination of animal biology, whilst also providing me with the opportunity to preserve animals for educational study. Giving animals new life is an immense privilege to me. The high level of skill, effort and time required for each of Elle's pieces means they can cost hundreds of pounds . ‘I will never harm an animal for the purpose of my work. I have many connections to farmers and aviculturists across the country that control pests and livestock on their land. ‘I have no intervention in the way that these animals are controlled, and am simply a vehicle of alternative disposal for their owners and keepers. ‘I also take pride in working with road kill, or animals that I find deceased in wooded areas where I live. I keep a paper trail to log the properties of every animal that I find, and acquire all the correct licenses when appropriate.’ While she creates stunning designs herself and on commission- from imposing peacocks to mouse ornaments and bird based fashion pieces- she also teaches taxidermy classes. Run in London and from an Essex farm house, these sessions allow anyone to learn how to properly prepare and stuff a mouse for £60. But for those who don’t quite trust themselves, Elle will preserve and pose nearly any animal you desire, with beloved deceased pets a common commission. However, commemorating Fido in this way does not come cheap. The high level of skill, effort and time required means a dog costs £980 while a cat will set you back £800 and a hamster or guinea pig £160.","Elle works full time as a taxidermist and teaches classes .

"By . Martha Cliff . A London based taxidermist has given a new meaning to the phrase drop dead gorgeous with her range of animal corpse fascinators. The one of a kind accessories are designed by Margot Magpie and are created using stuffed, dead animals such as mice and birds. The 31-year-old from Battersea took up the hobby three years ago, creating pieces for herself and friends but has since seen the business gain popularity and now sells the accessories for around £60 a piece. Margot Magpie creates unique fascinators using dead stuffed animals . Far from being run of the mill, most pieces are specially commissioned by Margot's clients guaranteeing that they will not suffer the embarrassment of matching outfits at a wedding. Despite the unusual method that goes into the making of the pieces Margot says that it is the unique materials that attracts her clientele, . 'They ask me to make something for a wedding or events, or just for fun as I am very creative and I tend to use different techniques and materials' says Margot who adds that, for her, taxidermy was an obvious fashion choice. She says that birds in particular capture her imagination when creating the unique head pieces. Margot's favourite animal to work with is a bird as she says the wings have amazing colours . 'Taxidermy just made sense to me as something you might wear on your head or just on your person. 'I love birds and wanted to incorporate unused bits of the ones I found dead on the ground as roadkill. 'I thought that as a fashion statement it was unique as each bird wing is shaped differently depending on the bird type, and I love the asymmetry and pointy yet smooth edges the feathers create. 'I think birds are just stunning, especially when you are close enough to see the fine detail and colour. Many people think a crow wing is just black, but there is so much more spectrum to the colour and all birds have this.' Margot has seen popularity rise in the art of taxidermy and has since started teaching her own classes . In her classes Margot teaches students how to gut, stuff and pose mice into their 'cutest' positions . Margot says that she never has trouble selling any of her macabre pieces and has gone from selling exclusively online to working with individual commissions. 'Usually . if I make a batch and put them online, they sell very very fast. However . I have recently starting just taking commissions. 'It is more personalised and I think people enjoy experiencing the creative process with me ie choosing colours, fabric, and sourcing particular birds.' Margot says she does receive abuse for her work but insists that she never kills an animal purposefully for her work . Since starting her businesses, the quirky designer has seen the interest in taxidermy grow and has started teaching a range of taxidermy classes across London. In the sessions Margot teaches her students how to gut, clean, stuff and pose mice, birds and small mammals in a variety of positions. Margot first started selling her unusual accessories to friends who wanted something a bit different for special occasions . Margot sells her head pieces for around £60 each both online and through privately commissioned pieces . Margot's classes have proved extremely popular and she has since extended her tutoring to private classes where clients can specialise in guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters as well as the usual birds. Margot says that despite the popularity of her work she does recieve some abuse for her controversial fashion statements. Margot says that when she makes a batch of accessories they sell out extremely quickly . 'Sometimes I do get negative reactions, I get people telling me they think it is absolutely appalling, cruel or disrespectful. 'But I don't kill anything purposefully for taxidermy, so I don't have any issues with it. 'There will always be people who think it is distasteful or who are against it - but each to their own.' For Margot it makes perfect sense to use taxidermy as a fashion accessory .","Margot Magpie creates fascinators using dead and stuffed animals .

"By . Tom White, Press Association . Newcastle fan Liam Sweeney was 'a gentle giant' and a 'family man', the funeral of the first British victim of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 to be identified has been told.

"By . Rebecca Brett for MailOnline . British travellers are deserting the beach in favour of seeking out more cultural holiday experiences, new research reveals. Almost half of holidaymakers now describe themselves as 'culture vultures' and prefer delving into museums and historic sites rather than just lounging on the beach. According to a new survey, trippers are heading to more off-the-beaten track destinations to explore local history and traditions thanks to the rising value of the pound, with Eastern Europe offering some of the best deals. Warsaw Old Town: The cost of six cultural excursions in Poland's capital city costs just £69.95 . The Cost of Culture report by Post Office Travel Money reveals tickets for national ballet and opera performances in Warsaw can be picked up for £20 thanks to a 13 per cent rise in sterling over the past five years. Comparing a basket of six cultural items including a museum trip, visit to an art gallery and a classical concert, the Polish capital came out cheapest in a league of 12, costing just £69.65 in total. Museum entry is around £2.82, while a night at the ballet or opera will set trippers back around £20.13 each. The Hungarian capital of Budapest came out second cheapest with six cultural treats costing just over £80. In third place is Prague at £92.59 followed by Dublin, Rome and Berlin. The report comes as figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that last year 5,333,000 Britons went abroad on a break of one to three nights - spending around £1,635 million. Rome is ranked as the fifth cheapest city on the list with visits to six cultural attractions costing £132.01 . 'With almost half of holidaymakers seeking a helping of culture while on a leisure break, it seems that people are now looking to add an extra dimension to their trips abroad', said Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money. 'The latest figures suggest that UK tourists are already spending many millions of pounds on short breaks abroad but culture vultures can cut their costs by doing their homework in advance and swapping to a city like Warsaw or Budapest where prices are significantly lower than better known cultural capitals like Paris or Amsterdam.' The research shows it may even be cheaper to go abroad for a taste of culture with London coming out as the most expensive city. London was the most expensive city with the total of six cultural trips costing £256.25 . Although museum and art gallery entry is usually free, high costs of ballet and opera performances push the cultural basket price to more than £250. A 23-per cent strengthening of the pound against the Czech koruna means a cultural trip to Prague costs around the same as it did in 2009. Dublin and Rome emerge as best value for a cultural break in the Eurozone with prices in the Irish capital 19 per cent better than five years ago. Going to see the ballet in Warsaw costs just over £20 while in London it can be in excess of £90 . Mr Brown added: 'We based our report on the idea that people would want to visit galleries and museums every day on a short break and spend evenings at music-based events. 'What we found was that while every city surveyed boasts world-class cultural attractions, prices vary dramatically. 'This means culture vultures can save hundreds of pounds by doing their homework before booking and swap expensive cities for cheaper ones.' WARSAW - £69.95 . Museum: £2.82 . Art gallery: £3.02 .

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Unions representing Air France employees are calling on the airline to halt its flights to and from the West African countries that are grappling with the worst Ebola outbreak ever. The National Union of Air France (SNGAF), which represents flight crew, is circulating an online petition that says the flights pose a serious health risk and are putting a significant amount of stress on employees. More than 1,300 people have died during the outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. An Air France employees' union is circulating a petition asking the airline to halt its flights to Ebola-hit nations . Sophie Gorins, the secretary-general of the SNPNC union, which represents cabin crew, told AFP: ‘We know that our jobs put us at risk, but they are measured risks. This is completely out of control and the information is not the same from one day to the next.’ Some workers are refusing to board planes bound for the affected countries, a spokesman for the airline said. Air France crew members have been trained to deal with infectious diseases such as Ebola, and aircraft are outfitted with special containment gear. The airline offers daily service to Conakry, Guinea and Lagos, Nigeria, and three to five flights a week to Freetown, Sierra Leones and two other destinations in Nigeria. A handful of carriers have stopped flying into and out of countries affected by the outbreak. Outbreak: A health worker wearing protective gear offers water to an Ebola patient in Kenema, Sierra Leone . Earlier this month, British Airways announced that it was suspended its service between Heathrow Airport and Monrovia, Liberia and Freetown, Sierra Leone. The UK airline followed the lead of Emirates, which became the first major international airline to cancel flights, and African carriers Arik and ASKY. Kenya Airways and Korean Air Lines have also halted flights to the region. The current outbreak is believed to have started in Guinea last December. There is no proven treatment or vaccine. The World Health Organisation said the risk of transmission of Ebola virus disease during air travel is low as it is not spread by breathing air from an infected person. The organisation said: ‘Transmission requires direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected living or dead persons or animals, all unlikely exposures for the average traveller. ‘The risk of getting infected on an aircraft is also small as sick persons usually feel so unwell that they cannot travel and infection requires direct contact with the body fluids of the infected person.’ In one of its latest statements, WHO said it does not recommend any ban on international travel or trade.","One union has started a petition that says employees' health is at risk .

"By . Michael Gadd For Mailonline . It is England's tallest war memorial and an iconic fixture of Leek since 1925, but the arrival of a new hotel has silenced the Staffordshire market town's iconic memorial. The town council has been forced to compromise with a new Premier Inn which called for the chimes of the memorial to be restricted in order to stop guests being disturbed. Instead of sounding off every 15 minutes from 6.15am the bell will first toll at 8.15am each day to enable the Premier Inn to live up to its promise of a great night's sleep for guests. Bell silenced: A Premier Inn's opening in Leek reduced the Nicholson War Memorial's bell song by two hours . The bell historically chimes until 10pm, and will continue to do so despite attempts from the Premier Inn to shut it down at 8pm, a request rejected by the council of the historic town, which lies 10 miles north-east of Stoke-on-Trent. Leek deputy mayor Pamela Wood, who is chairman of the Friends of the Nicholson War Memorial group and whose husband is a bell ringer, said the compromise is a good move for the town as it bids to attract tourism. 'Most people won't notice the difference because there aren't that many people around at that time of the morning,' Wood told the BBC. Premier Inn has spent £6.5million on the hotel on Ashbourne Road and brought 30 jobs to the town. The 63-bed accommodation is built around the former Talbot pub. The 90-foot tall memorial was commissioned by manufacturer Sir Arthur Nicholson and his wife Lady Marianne in tribute to their son, Lieutenant Basil Lee Nicholson, who was killed in action at Ypres in 1915. Historic: Sir Arthur Nicholson (left) and his wife Lady Marianne commissioned the memorial for their son, Lieutenant Basil Lee Nicholson, who died a war hero in Ypres 1915, and the tower being opened in 1925 . The monument, which has four clock faces, honours all victims of World War I and II and has plaques commemorating the 535 men and women from Leek and the surrounding district who died in those conflicts. The building was restored between 2010 and 2012 thanks mostly to a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The clock's keeper, Alan Brundrett, perhaps the man most likely to be put out by the two-hour silencing also considers the good of the town when commenting on the Premier Inn's influence. Keeping the peace: Locals have responded favourably to the arrival of the Premier Inn in Leek . He pointed out to the Stoke Sentinel that the clock once chimed every 15 minutes for 24 hours. 'This was before electronic timers and it would have been impracticable to fit a silencer,' he told the paper. 'I don’t think it makes much of a difference. If you book a hotel room in a nice quiet town I think it’s fair enough to expect a quiet night’s sleep.' The agreement with the Premier Inn also means the bell can be rung three additional times each year 'to mark significant occasions.' A spojepserson fro Premier Inn said: 'In close consultation with the local Council we agreed with them that the bells would not ring between 10pm and 8am to help guests to get a great night's sleep. 'However, the bells will continue to ring at all other times. The agreement also means that the bells can be rung an additional three times a year, inclusive of the 10pm-8am period, to mark significant occasions. 'So far the feedback we have received from residents and local businesses has been extremely positive but we will continue to monitor this on an on-going basis. We hope that the new jobs created by the hotel and the investment in the area underlines our commitment to the town.'","The Nicholson War Memorial, opened in 1925, will chime for two hours less .

"By . Anucyia Victor For Mailonline . This amazing Egyptian eco-hotel, which looks like it rises up out of the desert, has no electricity and bans mobile phones outside the bedrooms. Rooms at the stunning Adrère Amellal, which start from £460 a night, are made from materials like salt-rock and palm for the roof. The thick, earthen walls absorb the heat of the sun during day, maintaining a cool interior at the 40-suite hotel. At night, when the temperature drops, the walls radiate the heat captured from the scorching sun. Torches, beeswax candles and stars help illuminate the completely electricity-free 40-room resort. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have both been guests at the hotel near Siwa, staying in the £1,420-a-night Royal Desert Romm, which boasts the only bathtub at the property - installed especially for the couple. The earthen buildings are designed to blend in with the surrounding desert, along with the olive and palm groves and the relaxing slow-bubbling Roman springs. A spokesman for the hotel said: 'All our furniture and accessories pay tribute to the talented artisanship of the Siwan people.' Adrère Amellal sits only 16km away from Siwa, an ancient city famed as the location of the Oracle of Amon, who was consulted by Alexander the Great before he continued with his Persian conquest. The city is surrounded by seven stunning salt lakes, the largest being Al Zaytun, which is 25km long. A wondrous mirage: The incredible Adrère Amellal resort in Siwa is made entirely out of salt rock and looks like it's rising out of the desert. The resort is close to Siwa, an ancient city near the Libyan border and overlooks Siwa Lake . Lit up by stars: The hotel is completely electricity-free and relies on starlight, torches and beeswax candles for light.  Made of kershef (a mixture of salt rock and mud) the thick earthen walls absorb heat in the day and radiate warmth at night . Romantic lighting: Lanterns illuminate the stairways to the rooms (left) and candles brighten the indoor dining area (right). Guests can also opt to have dinner outdoors . Wander around the resort and discover  open courtyards and roof terraces which can be converted into private dining rooms. Dine under the stars or request for candles to illuminate the table . An oasis of calm: The Berber-style hotel is part of a local sustainable development plan. The hotel roofs are supported by felled palm trees. All other wood used in the hotel is taken from the yearly trimming of surrounding olive trees . Cool and airy rooms: Sleep on crisp cotton sheets or recline on the locally-made furniture, created using traditional methods by artisans around the area . Stunning: The 40-room resort faces the Siwa Lake (left) and has a natural spring fed-pool. Enjoy traditional delicacies (right) in one of the many dining areas . Classy: Most of the food served comes from the hotel's organic farm and almost everything is home-made. There isn't a menu for lunch or dinner but individual dislikes are taken into consideration when food is being prepared . Visitors can relax under the shade of palm trees by the natural spring-fed pool (right) or just lounge on the comfortable floor cushions in their rooms . Communal area: Gaze across Siwa Lake and while away the afternoon in silent contemplation or grab a book from the resort's library, conveniently located by the lake .","Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall visited the socially-conscious Adrère Amellal resort in Siwa .

Adventure company Discover the World is planning to fly customers to the eruption site – if there is one – as soon as it is safe and logistically possible to do so. The UK-based operator has set up a ‘volcano hotline’ that allows people to sign up for the trip, and it is promising sightseeing tours that could involve helicopter flights or transport by Superjeep.

Four years ago, Discover the World took about 300 people to witness the Fimmvorduhals eruption in south-western Iceland. Some of the lucky tourists arrived within 24 hours and were fortunate enough to see spouting magma. The ‘tourist’ eruption occurred about a month before the Eyjafjallajokull volcano blew its top and spewed a massive ash cloud that shut down much of Europe’s airspace. Despite the chaos that followed Eyjafjallajokull, getting to an eruption site at Bardarbunga shouldn’t be a problem, according to Discover the World. Eyjafjallajokull: A gigantic ash cloud caused widespread disruptions for air travellers after an eruption in 2010 . River of fire: Molten lava flows along the Eyjafjallajokull glacier following an eruption in 2010 . The Icelandic travel specialists believe it is highly unlikely Europe will see an air traffic disruption similar to that of 2010 because scientists are better prepared for such an event. Bardarbunga is Iceland’s largest volcano and is situated under the country’s largest glacier. It has been rocked by two earthquake swarms for six days and is at risk of eruption, although there are no signs of magma moving toward the surface, according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office. As a precaution, police have evacuated an area near the volcano and closed roads, and the country’s aviation alert level has been raised to orange, the second-highest level on the five-colour scale.","Discover the World is planning to fly customers to the eruption site .

"By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . How many people does it take to solve a Rubik's cube? The answer is 84 people - and a monkey and a snake - from eleven different countries, according to a filmmaker who took the puzzle on a trip around the world. Nuseir Yassin set off on the trip after graduating from Harvard in economics in May, but he decided to take a bit of light entertainment with him - in the form of a Rubik's cube. For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to one colour. In order to allow people from all over the world to take part and decipher the code, Nuseir planned the moves beforehand. He then asked people in each country to complete a single move under his instruction while he filmed them with his iPhone. Nuseir also included some brilliant footage of a monkey playing with the cube and a snake slithering past. 'When I asked people to do their move, I told them which move they have to take,' Yassin explained to The Huffington Post. 'It's basically impossible to have people know what move to make if you just hand them a Rubik's Cube and say ""go"".' Monkey business: Nuseir Yassin gave this Rubik's cube to the mammal to see if it would make the right move . Nuseir began his journey in England before moving on to other countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and his native Israel. 'I had to spend an average of 5 minutes demonstrating what I was asking from them. 'This is, after all, an odd thing to ask a random stranger. I'd say, eventually, I got much better at asking the right people to do the move.' Despite only being able to speak Arabic and English, Nuseir was able to signal to people in other countries how to complete the cube.","Harvard student Nuseir Yassin set off around the world after graduating .

"By . Nick Pisa In Perugia . Updated: . 11:00 EST, 24 September 2011 . With the prospect of freedom only days away, the pressure has clearly taken its toll on Amanda Knox. Showing visible signs of hair loss yesterday, the 24-year-old looked pale and apprehensive as she attended the closing statements which could see her conviction for the murder of roommate Meredith Kercher overturned. Knox wore her hair in a centre parting - her scalp betraying signs of the strain she is under - and managed a . weak smile to her father, Curt Knox, and mother, Edda Mellas, who had flown in from . Seattle and was at the back of the court. She has good reason to be optimistic, though, as a damning new court report has condemned the original forensic investigation - increasing the chances of her 26-year sentence being quashed. Feeling the strain: Amanda Knox showed clear signs of hair loss as she attended a court hearing in Perugia today, which could see her conviction for the murder of Meredith Kercher overturned . Pressure: Amanda Knox leaves the courtroom at the end of her appeal trial session . And today an Italian prosecutor attacked the 'embarrassing' performance of forensic experts who shed doubt on evidence used to convict American student Amanda Knox for the murder of her British housemate. On the second day of closing arguments in Knox's appeals trial in the university town of Perugia, prosecutor Manuela Comodi questioned the methods used by the experts whose work was not up to standards, she said. 'Would you entrust the marriage of your only daughter to a cook who knew all the recipes by heart but has never cooked?"" Comodi asked the panel of lay and professional judges. The experts' report boosted Knox's case for being absolved of murdering Meredith Kercher with her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito during a frenzied sex game in 2007. Their report concluded traces of Sollecito's DNA found on Kercher's bra clasp could have been due to contamination. But if contamination had occurred, DNA belonging to many others would also have been found on the clasp, Comodi argued. Pulling out a white bra, Comodi said Sollecito's DNA ended up on the clasp when he pulled one end of Kercher's bra strap and cut off the bra with his other hand. Amanda Knox arrives at her appeal trial session today with her hair back in a ponytail . Amanda Knox's face shows the strain today during her appeal trial session in Perugia . Meanhwile Knox's father has urged the . heartbroken parents of Meredith Kercher to see that his daughter had . nothing to do with the brutal murder. Mr Knox spoke as his daughter's appeal . resumed today and after Meredith's heartbroken family had described how . she had been 'completely forgotten' as emphasis on the case had shifted . to Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito. They . were convicted of murdering Meredith, 21, who was found semi naked and . with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox and . two Italian women almost four years ago. They . have insisted they are innocent of the murder and are appealing against . the conviction which saw Knox jailed for 26 years and Sollecito for 25 . and their families are more hopeful than ever that they will be . released. Mr Knox, who is in Perugia to be with his daughter spoke of the Kercher's agony and said: 'We have not reached out to them but we have always expressed our sincere condolences to them for their loss. 'They are going through a living hell, they have lost their daughter, it's the worst thing that can happen to a parent but understanding the truth will allow them closure. To have two kids in jail for something they did not do, will not do honour to their daughter. 'I want the Kercher family to know that Amanda had nothing to do with the death of their daughter. They have the impression that Amanda had something to do with this and until they know that she didn't we cannot reach out to them - I cannot imagine the pain the Kercher's feel. 'I am very hopefully - the report that was presented has given us hope but until the court announces that she can go free we have to wait - they are deciding on Amanda's life.' Plea: Curt Knox, who is in Perugia to be with his daughter, said that he is hopeful her conviction will be overturned . Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were jailed for 26 and 25 years respectively after being convicted of Meredith's murder . He added: 'She is feeling very jittery. All this stop starting is very hard for her but now we are finally underway we are hopeful that the court will make the right decision and clear her of this and we can take her home. The court has her life in their hands.' In an Italian TV interview Meredith's mother Arline and sister Stephanie, had spoken of how they feared Meredith's death had been overshadowed especially in the light of the new court report which slammed the police investigation as poorly handled with the real possibility that evidence had been contaminated and the verdict was unsafe. Stephanie said: 'In this whole case over the last four years Meredith has been completely forgotten but we need to find justice for her, the truth. 'There are no photos of Meredith in the papers or on the TV it is all on Amanda and Raffaele - the focus has shifted on them. 'Meredith was a lovely, intelligent person, loving and we lost her in tragic circumstances.' The original trial heard how a 30cm kitchen knife found at Sollecito's house had DNA from Meredith on the blade and that of Knox on the handle but the report said the amount from the victim was so small it could not be retested and should be considered unreliable - crucially they said there was no trace of blood on the knife but food starches were present. Also key to the first hearing was a . bloodied clasp from Meredith's bra found at the scene six weeks after . the original investigation by forensic teams and on which was said to be . Sollecito's DNA however the experts said the time gap gives rise to the . real possibility of contamination. Today . the hearing began with Perugia's chief prosecutor Giovanni Galati . making a statement to the court in which he backed his team and the . original investigators saying he had his 'full faith' in the original . findings and added: 'The conclusions of the report are unfounded and are . full of holes.' Knox could soon be free if her appeal against her conviction is successful . Stress: Knox, 24, looked pale and apprehensive in court but managing a weak smile to her father who had flown in from Seattle . At today's hearing Comodi tried to . keep the jurors interested in the highly technical discussion about DNA . testing and forensic science by using down-to-earth expressions and . simple language. At one point, to explain DNA testing, . she made references to ingredients used in pasta dishes; at another she . pulled out a bra from her bag, seeking to illustrate how she thought . the garment was cut from the victim's body. The DNA is crucial in the case, where no clear motive for the brutal killing has emerged. Prosecutors maintain that Knox's DNA . was found on the handle of a kitchen knife believed to be the murder . weapon, and that Kercher's DNA was found on the blade. They said . Sollecito's DNA was on the clasp of Kercher's bra as part of a mix of . evidence that also included the victim's genetic profile. Victim: Meredith Kercher was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox . But those findings were always disputed by the defence, and the appeals court decided to appoint two independent experts to review the evidence. The independent experts challenged both findings. They said police had made glaring errors in evidence-collecting and that below-standard testing and possible contamination raised doubts over the attribution of DNA traces, both on the blade and on the bra clasp, which was collected from the crime scene several weeks after the murder. The review significantly weakened the prosecution case, giving the 24-year-old Knox hope that she might be freed after four years behind bars. Prosecutors have fought hard to undermine the review. They have described it as superficial and sketchy. In several hearings in past weeks, and then again during the summations Friday and today, the prosecutors challenged the review point by point. Today Comodi said that the possibility that the bra clasp might have been contaminated with Sollecito's DNA was 'nil' since the bra clasp, while recovered after a delay, never left the crime scene. She noted that Sollecito, who had been dating Knox for about a week at the time of the November 1, 2007 killing, did not frequent Kercher's room. She insisted protocols were followed by forensic police. 'Sollecito was never there, but his DNA somehow got there and landed on the bra clasp,"" she said sarcastically, gesturing as if something was moving in the air. Comodi also had harsh words for the experts, accusing them of an ""embarrassing performance"". She contended they had been given a task they did not know how to fulfil and betrayed the trust of the court that had appointed them. She challenged their qualifications, saying: ""Would you entrust the wedding reception of your only daughter to somebody who knows all the recipes by heart but has never actually cooked?"" When questioned in court, the experts stood by their findings. A verdict in the appeals trial is expected either late September or early October.Next week, a lawyer representing the Kercher family and then the defence teams will deliver their closing arguments.. Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was in Perugia as part of her Leeds University and had only been in Italy for two months before she was brutally murdered and Knox and Sollecito were jailed in December 2009. A third defendant, small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing. He was handed a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in October 2008 which was later cut to 16 years.",But Italian prosecutor slams 'embarrassing' experts whose evidence could free her .
"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Preparation: Esther McVey claims it is her mission to better prepare school leavers for the work place . Young people must not let their dreams stand in the way of 'getting their foot in the door' of their first job, the employment minister said today. Esther McVey, who last week said the jobless should be prepared to take lowly jobs in coffee shops, insisted she was not telling people to lower their ambitions. But she insisted that they had to 'work their way up' as figures showed thousands of young jobless people have come off benefits after enrolling on controversial government work experience schemes. New government figures show more than 3,000 young people a month have been given an opportunity to get their foot on the career ladder through work experience since 2011. From January 2011 to May 2013 a total of 112,990 people aged 18-24 started work experience through the Government scheme. Around half of work experience participants were off benefits 21 weeks after starting a placement. Last week Miss McVey, 46, vowed that tackling . youth unemployment will be her ‘top priority’ but said that those . looking for work have to be prepared to get a foot on the ladder before . expanding their horizons. Asked . if they should be prepared to take ‘entry-level jobs’, she told the Mail: . ‘Absolutely. You could be working at Costa. But in a couple of years’ time you might say, “I’d like to manage the area” or might even want to . run a hotel in Dubai.’ But today she insisted she was not telling people to ditch their dreams to take any job. She told ITV's Daybreak: 'I’ve worked with kids for many, many years now, particularly inner city kids. 'I said ""Hold on to your dream, reach high, have a dream but what you need to do is get your foot on the ladder and work your way up"". 'I certainly did not say get say: ""Get rid of your dreams"". I said: ""Hold onto those dreams just work your way through"".' However she face criticism for suggesting there were jobs available which people were reluctant to take. Last year, more than 1,700 people applied . for eight jobs at a new Costa Coffee shop in Nottingham, which paid . between £6.10 and £10 an hour. A barista making coffee in Costa, Bromley, where Miss McVey suggested more young people should consider working . However, Miss McVey, a former TV presenter, said it was 'tough' in the jobs market but more roles are on offer. 'The latest employment stats only last Wednesday said this is a record number of people going to employment so this Government, what we came in to do was rebalance the economy, stabilise it, get growth and get jobs. 'There is a lot to be positive about but still much more work to do.' Latest employment figures also show that . an extra 280,000 people had a job in the last three months - the largest . quarterly increase since records began in the 1970s. Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'With more than 900,000 young people unemployed and 250,000 young people out of work for over a year its clear the Government is failing to get young people back to work. 'Even the government’s own advisers branded its flagship scheme for young people, the Youth Contract, a failure. In December the Government admitted that the last time long-term youth unemployment reached the levels we are seeing was under the last Tory government led by John Major.'","Esther McVey tells young they must to start at bottom and work way up .

"By . Thomas Burrows . It has long been regarded as the most important meal of the day. And now it seems that the traditional full English breakfast is back on the menu for a rising number of British people. New research has shown that people are choosing to kick-start the day with an old fashioned fry-up - commonly referred to as 'The Full Monty' because former British Army officer Field Marshal Montgomery was particularly fond of the classic breakfast. Scroll down for video . The traditional English breakfast has enjoyed a renaissance in the last year, with eggs doing especially well . The data from Kantar Worldpanel, a company dealing in consumer knowledge, showed that eggs featured in 804.6million breakfasts at home - up 13.7 per cent year on year. Servings of bacon and sausages also increased, by 7.1 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively. Trade magazine The Grocer said: 'The cooked breakfast is experiencing a renaissance. 'Over the past six months, Brits served up elements of the classic Full Monty - such as eggs, bacon, sausages and beans - on 142.4million more occasions than they did a year earlier. That’s an uplift of 9.8 per cent. Research from Kantar Worldpanel showed that more people are starting the day with a full English breakfast . 'These figures will surprise many as the . resurgence of cooked items contradicts received wisdom that fewer of us . eat a proper breakfast at home these days.' Interestingly, the research showed that increasing numbers of people are cooking smaller breakfasts, more often with one element of the classic fry up, with eggs doing particularly well. Andew Joret, chairman of the British Egg Industry Council said: 'If consumers are looking for unprocessed, natural and healthy breakfast options, eggs are the ideal option as they are a rich and natural source of high quality protein, vitamins and minerals.' Similar eating patterns are also benefiting the other breakfast favourites, bacon and sausages. A spokesman for Bpex, the pig levy board, said: 'Although bacon and sausages are more popular at weekends, the fastest growth has come from weekday breakfasts.' Sophie Flacks, of Kantar Worldpanel, said: 'Filling up at the start of the day is becoming very important to consumers, with an extra 366 million breakfast choices over the past six months being motivated by the need for a filling option.'

"By . Sam Cunningham for the Daily Mail . Follow @@samcunningham . Jermain Defoe is hoping for a move to the Barclays Premier League to rejoin Harry Redknapp at QPR. The striker has been at MLS side Toronto since July, but QPR are in the market for a forward after they lost Loic Remy to Chelsea and Defoe is ready to replace him on a permanent deal. Rangers also hope to tie up a loan deal for Sandro  and are interested in Aaron Lennon, too. Both worked under Redknapp at White Hart Lane, but the club wouldn't be able to sign them both temporarily because of loan regulations. On his way? Sandro may be set to leave Tottenham and join QPR before the transfer window closes on Monday . Race against time: Sandro may move after seemingly falling out of Mauricio Pochettino's plans at Spurs . Going? Aaron Lennon (pictured) and Sandro were left out of Mauricio Pochettino's squad for Sunday's game . Charlie Austin has scored nine goals in his last nine games at Loftus Road. Redknapp signed Defoe, who has scored 15 goals in 16 league games for Toronto, while in charge at his previous two clubs Tottenham and Portsmouth. Sandro and Lennon were left out of Tottenham’s squad for Sunday’s defeat by Liverpool. Toronto FC general manager Tim Bezbatchenko confirmed on Sunday: 'We have received multiple offers for Jermain Defoe and we will make a decision on this in the next 24 hours.' Rangers have also bid for Dutch striker Jeremain Lens of Dynamo Kiev and are talking to Dnipro left-back Ivan Strinic. They have also revived interest in Ajax forward Kolbeinn Sigthorsson. After having to pull Remy out of his squad to face Sunderland at the last minute on Saturday when Chelsea triggered his release clause, Redknapp admitted he would be looking to strengthen in that area. He has only Charlie Austin, who scored his first Premier League goal in their win against Sunderland, and Bobby Zamora as available out-and-out strikers and both have been prone to injuries in recent seasons. After QPR’s first win of the season, Redknapp called for a rule to be put in place to stop clubs blaming medical tests when deals break down at the last minute. Remy was on the verge of a transfer to Liverpool in July only for the Merseyside club to claim he failed a medical. Hunting: QPR manager Harry Redknapp is keen to bolster his squad and is looking at the Tottenham pair . Familiar sight! Redknapp is known for his interviews through car windows on deadline day . Redknapp said: ‘Remy’s a fit lad, he’s never had a problem. That’s a rule that needs to be changed. ‘When there’s a fee agreed and you have the medical, if you don’t sign a player I don’t think you should say he has failed a medical. You should say you couldn’t agree terms. The medical side can finish people’s careers in some cases.’ Redknapp did not have Remy available after Jose Mourinho triggered his £10.5million release clause a few hours before the game. Remy’s absence did not matter in the end as QPR won their first points of the season when Austin scored from close range in first-half stoppage time. Redknapp said Liverpool’s allegation damaged QPR. ‘I think it did,’ he added. ‘It didn’t do us any favours.’","Aaron Lennon and Sandro both left out-of-favour by Mauricio Pochettino .

"By . James Gordon . A hair stylist from New York is smartening up the city's homeless by giving them haircuts on his day off. Mark Bustos, 30, usually works at a trendy salon in Manhattan where he deals with glamour models and sexy photo shoots, but he has found a unique way to give back to the city. Every weekend, he wonders the city's streets to find people who look as though they could do with a haircut and who might otherwise not be able to afford it. Mr Bustons experience in hair-styling goes back to when he was a teenager. At the age of 14 he was styling out of his parent's garage. Scroll down for video . Client number one: This man was sitting on the corner of Bowery and Rivington Street in Manhattan when Mark Bustos found him . A goat herder in Jamaica: This man was trying to make a little extra money by charging tourists to come see his goats. Bustos isn't sure whether he was homeless, but he was definitely in need of a haircut . Mark Bustos: His motto is simple: 'Be awesome to somebody' Bustos, who kicked off his hairstyling career at age 14 out of his parents' garage, said that he's 'never made a penny in my life (that) hasn't had to do with hair . They don't always know when their next haircut will be. Most times they ask me to buzz it all off… Til we meet again…. His haircuts for the homeless was inspired after taking a trip in May 2012, to his native country of The Philippines where he snipped away on underprivileged kids. He said the trip gave him the idea and momentum to continue the good deeds back in the States. 'The feeling was so rewarding, I decided to bring the positive energy back to New York City.' He has also done the same for poor people living in Jamaica, Costa Rica and Los Angeles. 'I do believe people with a proper, professional haircut receive more respect than those who do not have a proper haircut,' Bustos told Today. 'Having a proper haircut also gives the recipient much more confidence.' The first thing this man asked Bustos after his haircut was: 'Do you know anyone that's hiring?' The transformations seen after a simple haircut and shave are incredible. Bustos says that people are treated better when their hair is styled neatly . 'He didn't say much during the haircut,' said Bustos about Jamar, who he found outside a homeless shelter. Afterwards, when he looked in the mirror Jamar asked, 'Do you know anyone who is hiring?' 'He actually had his own buzzers but they were all rusty and weren't working anymore, so he said it was perfect that I showed up. He asked me to buzz all his hair off because he didn't know when his next haircut would be.' 'Red,' as he is known by his friends, is a war veteran who can almost always be found sitting on his wooden stool at the corner of the Bowery and Rivington Street in Manhattan . After getting his hair cut and his mustache cleaned up, James said he now has the confidence to start looking for a job again -- starting with some nearby hotels. Along the way, he's posted some of his customers' cuts on his Instagram feed . Sometimes Bustos says he can walk around for hours looking for a haircut recipient on the streets . Bustos strolls the streets of New York most Sundays to continue the tradition he started in the Philippines and later duplicated in Jamaica, Costa Rica and Los Angeles . His friend and professional photographer Devin Masga takes photos of his work and posts them to an Instagram account. The transformations are often incredible. 'I've decided to have photos taken in an attempt to inspire others to do great things for fellow human beings,' he said. Bustos explained that he does his services in open spaces not for people to see him, but for others to be inspired to do a good deed to the needy. 'Even a simple smile can go a long way,' he added. Bustos says he always cuts hair in public so people can find inspiration in good deeds . In the past Mark Bustos said he didn't take photos of his haircuts, but now he does because he wants to inspire others to do great things for fellow human beings .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Of all the stories of luck and survival to emerge from the Great War, they are among the most remarkable. These three British soldiers all cheated death when items in their pockets took bullets that should have killed them. The incredible escapes of Wilfrid Bush, Ralfe Whistler and Joseph Clucas have now emerged 100 years after the outbreak of fighting. Private Bush was saved by his Bible, a bullet destined for Lieutenant Whistler hit his pocket camera while Corporal Clucas’s whistle deflected a shot that would have killed him. Their tales have been told for the first time by Paul Atterbury, an expert on the Antiques Roadshow. His book, called Antiques Roadshow: World War One in 100 Family Treasures, highlights stories that came to light in the making of the programme’s First World War centenary episodes but never made it to air. They include: . SAVED BY HIS BIBLE . Private Bush had his devout Christianity to thank for saving his life when, in 1917, two bullets destined for his chest were stopped by a Bible he kept in his breast pocket. Pte Bush was knocked off his feet and into a shell hole on the ravaged battlefield in Ypres, Belgium, and nearly drowned before being dragged to safety by his comrades. They feared Pte Bush had been mortally wounded but instead found a bullet lodged in the brown Bible. Another had ricocheted off the Bible and passed through his collarbone. Following the war Pte Bush worked in a paper mill in Bristol. He died in 1960 aged 76. Saved: Wilfrid Bush, pictured with his daughter and wife, had his devout Christianity to thank for saving his life when, in 1917, two bullets destined for his chest were stopped by a Bible he kept in his breast pocket . Fate: It was feared Pte Bush had been mortally wounded but instead found a bullet lodged in the brown Bible. Another had ricocheted off the Bible and passed through his collarbone . BULLET BOUNCED OFF HIS WHISTLE . Corporal Clucas, a veteran of the 1914 Battle of Mons, was fighting in France with the Royal Field Artillery the following year when he was hit by enemy fire. But his luck was with him that day as the bullet bounced off a whistle he was carrying. The Liverpudlian soldier’s luck ran out later in the war when he was wounded fighting in the Battle of Passchendaele at Ypres in 1917. While being taken by stretcher to a dressing station a shell exploded, killing the 22 year old. Close call: Corporal Clucas, a veteran of the 1914 Battle of Mons, was fighting in France with the Royal Field Artillery the following year when he was hit by enemy fire . Fortune on his side: His luck was with him that day as the bullet bounced off a whistle he was carrying . CAMERA TO THE RESCUE . Ralfe Whistler, a lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry, saw action on the Western Front, the Dardanelles, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Russia. He had already been wounded twice – and made a full recovery – when he was drafted to Mesopotamia in April 1916 during the unsuccessful relief of Kut, Iraq. The Glaswegian officer was hit several times by gunfire but the bullet aimed at his heart was stopped by his pocket camera. After a spell in hospital in Basra Lt Whistler returned to fighting but was sent home after contracting typhoid fever. He later returned to the army but was killed in April 1917 at Arras in France. Mr Atterbury, who lives in Lyme Regis, Dorset, said: ‘What it highlights is the sheer chance of the war. So much came down to being in the right place at the right time or the wrong place at the wrong time. ‘Had these soldiers made even the most minuscule of movements they would have been killed but as fate would have it the bullets intended for them hit objects kept in their uniforms.’ Survivor: Ralfe Whistler, a lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry, saw action on the Western Front, the Dardanelles, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Russia .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A mother is facing a £7,000 bill after her 12-year-old son ran up huge charges playing a popular online game on his phone. Theresa Cox said she and her son James were not given any warning about costs of up to £240 a day on Clash of Clans. T-Mobile said Supercell, the developer of the game, was responsible for setting the charges. Scroll down for video . James Cox, 12, from Breaston, Derbyshire ran up the £7,000 phone bill while playing on his smartphone . James was playing Clash of the Clans on his smartphone where he was paying £240-a-day for add ons . But Ms Cox, of Breaston, Derbyshire, said she might now have to sell her car to pay the debt. She added: 'The only way I have financially of raising that money is selling my car and I need my car to get to work. 'I naively thought the industry was better regulated than this - that there were safeguards in place. 'Before you download the game it says there are in-app purchases and each time you make one you have to approve it. 'Nobody at any point alerted me to the situation.' Ms Cox's son inadvertently paid extra charges that are used to progress in the game. In similar games, players can pay for extra gaming credits - or add-ons - which would otherwise take a long time to build up or as a fast track to unlocking content in the game. She told BBC Derbyshire: 'He bought two add-ons totalling £5.98 for the game Clash of Clans and the phone has kept buying (add-ons) at a rate of £240 per day.' James said: 'I was confused to what had happened - I didn't have a clue.' His mother said she did not blame her son, but added: 'He was slightly over-enthusiastic when playing on his phone.' Alistair Charlton, a games expert with Mobile Choice website, said he had tried the game and that there were various password options for when transactions were necessary, including just once at the beginning, every 30 minutes or after each transaction. Smartphones often operate on a system where applications themselves are free but various add-ons will then be offered to you in exchange for money. This could take the form of in-game credits or 'currency' to help secure game upgrades or unlockable content or extra features with the application. But there are options to turn off in-app purchases off on different systems. On Apple's iOS the 'restrictions' menu it is possible to turn such purchases off altogether or set your own password. Tap on 'Settings' then 'General' and 'Restrictions' then tap 'Enable Restrictions' and choose a PIN and enter it a second time to confirm. At this point it's possible to set restrictions from a menu and in the 'Allowed Content' menu, slide 'In app purchases' to 'Off'. On Google Android open Google Play Store and cselect 'Menu' and then 'Settings' and under 'User Controls' there is an option to enter the PIN to confirm. At this point, tick the box to 'Use PIN for purchases' - anyone wanting to make a puchase in the app will have to know the PIN. On Amazon Kindle Fire open the Amazon Appstore app and choose 'Menu' then 'Settings' and then select 'Parental Controls before tapping on 'Enable Parental Controls'. At this point you can enter your Amazon password or tick the 'Use PIN' box, if you prefer a PIN. But he was unable to explain how £240 would have been charged every day. 'For each payment made there would have been an email receipt sent to the person whose Google account is registered on the phone. 'Before you download the game it says there are in-app purchases and each time you make one you have to approve it.' Mrs Cox said: 'Mobile firms need to review procedures, and forget making a profit from vulnerable people.' T-Mobile said it has placed Mrs Cox's bill on hold to allow to her resolve the issue with the game provider. Supercell refused to comment on individual complaints, but advised users to read the parent's policy on the firm's website.","Theresa Cox faces £7,000 bill after son ran up huge charges on mobile phone game .

New York businessman Marc Lino and his Scottish wife Lynne have bought Candacraig Houseand its surrounding estate from comedian Billy Connolly and his wife . Mrs Lino, 44, has set up a company called Candacraig Enterprises and a new website for the property is set to launch soon. Mr Lino founded Billy's Bakery with a friend from business school in 2003 and it now has three stores in New York. A profile of Mr Lino on his company's website reads: 'Marc has more than 15 years of experience in consulting and has worked with clients in the US, Europe and Asia across a variety of industries, with a focus on Financial Services and Technology. 'He has teamed with clients to address a wide array of business issues relating to strategy, full potential and enterprise transformation (including IT). 'Prior to moving to Amsterdam, Marc was a partner in Bain's New York Office.' Mr Connolly, 71, bought Candacraig House from Body Shop founder Anita Roddick for £590,000 in 1998. He then spent an additional £500,000 buying up the neighbouring properties in order to ensure greater privacy. Marc Lino and his wife Lyne, pictured centre, welcomed locals into their home at the weekend to celebrate the traditional Lonach Gathering and Games . During his time at the house, the comedian entertained celebrity friends there including Steve Martin, Dame Judi Dench and the late Robin Williams. At the time it went on sale last year, Jamie Macnab, of selling agents Savills, said: 'It is absolutely gorgeous, in the most stunning position and money has been lavished on it over the years.' Mr Connolly now spends most of his time at his apartment in New York but recently said he was considering moving to the south coast of England. He said: 'I've been a moving target for a long, long time. It suits me lovely, but recently I've been thinking about moving back to Britain. 'I don't know why but it's been calling on me. I just feel this tug, it keeps coming into my mind. I thought about Brighton a lot.' It is understood the comic and his wife kept a cottage in the grounds of Candacraig as part of the sale. The Linos were unavailable for comment.","Billy Connolly sells his mansion in Strathdon, Aberdeenshire for  £3million .

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Don’t be surprised if you encounter larger crowds when you’re strolling through a town square or museum on your next staycation. It appears many holidaymakers are choosing to remain closer to home this year, with the average Briton splurging on two or three UK breaks instead of an overseas getaway, according to a new study. Sixty per cent of us are planning at least one domestic trip that will last an average of four days. Light my way: More holidaymakers are choosing to stay in converted lighthouses, coast houses and windmills . Staycation: 60% of Britons are planning at least one UK break this year, according to a new study . The survey commissioned by luxury holiday rental firm Rural Retreats analysed the habits of more than 2,000 adults and found that Britons consider a shorter staycation a better fit with their busy lifestyles. With couples facing the challenge of getting time off work together and children committed to summer activities, the traditional two-week foreign getaway is no longer practical for many families, the study found. Holidaymakers are spending 15 per cent less on overseas trips compared to 2013, and the survey suggested there is a growing demand for more interesting destinations closer to home. And it appears more families are choosing to spend their nights in unusual places. Rural Retreats reported increased demand for overnight stays in converted lighthouses, coast houses and windmills. On top of the world: A traveller takes in the sights while visiting Peak District National Park . Summer fun: The average Briton is splurging on two or three UK breaks this year, the study revealed . Charles Millward, chief executive of Rural Retreats, said: ‘In this country we have stunning landscapes, fantastic heritage and great holiday locations to enjoy all year around and more people are being reminded of that. ‘Having decided to take a break, Brits are looking to enjoy something different, rather than simply staying in a hotel or B&B. ‘Staying in a unique location like a lighthouse can provide fun and a very different experience, adding to the enjoyment.’","60% of British holidaymakers are planning a domestic trip .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . Property website Zoopla accidentally rated this run-down cul-de-sac in the West Midlands as one of Britain's most expensive residential streets - with prices averaging  £3.6million. A computer software glitch calculated that houses in Crawshaws Road in Castle Bromwich were among the most desirable in the country. The error put the modest neighbourhood above London's most prestigious postcode W8 in Kensington where house prices average £2.78million. Error: Property website Zoopla accidentally rated this run-down cul-de-sac in the West Midlands as one of Britain's most expensive residential streets - with prices averaging £3.6million . Price hike: The error put the modest neighbourhood above London's most prestigious postcode W8 in Kensington where house prices average £2.78million . Homeowners on the 38-house road were stunned after their properties apparently rocketed to almost 30 times more than their actual value of just over £125,000. The error in the firm's Property Rich List 2014 declared the average house price on Crawshaws Road - which is mostly made up of social housing - was £3,562,687. Incredibly, the Knightsbridge postcode SW7 is the next most expensive with average values reaching £2.48 million while prices in Chelsea's SW3 are £2.37million. Pricey: The average house price on Crawshaws Road was given as £3,562,687, higher than the Knightsbrige SW7 postcode . Desirable: The glitch priced the homes in Crawshaws Road above those in Wellington Court, Knightsbridge . Zoopla bosses spotted the mistake  after it was published and blamed it on a fault in the formula used to estimate the value of thousands of UK homes. People living on the road - just 200 yards from the busy M6 motorway - have been amused their neighbourhood has been ranked as one of Britain's most sought-after addresses. Tracy Hogan, 50, who works at Asda and as a school dinner lady, paid £114,000 for her three-bedroom house in 2004. The mother-of-three joked: 'It's hilarious really but it explains why I've got two jobs because obviously I need to work more to keep myself in the lifestyle I've become accustomed to. Seeing the funny side: Tracy Hogan, 50, and Bev Bridges, 36, were stunned after their properties apparently rocketed to almost 30 times more than their actual value of just over £125,000 . Typical: Mother-of-three Bev Bridges, 36, said the street was a typical working class area . 'Now that we're officially living on one of Britain's most expensive streets we're thinking of getting some posh gates fitted at the top of the road to stop the riff raff coming in. 'Even the postman's going to get vetted from now on. We're going up in the world. 'I reckon our house prices have gone up because of HS2. It's planned to come up right beside us so obviously that's going to make it a desirable place to live for commuters.' Husband Steve, 42, an engineer, added: 'I have heard the estate has been suggested as a site for oil fracking. 'There's supposed to be a lot of fossil fuels beneath the ground. 'We're doing our house up at the moment, but I think we could only dream of fetching £3.6million.' Single mother-of-three Bev Bridges, 36, has lived in a housing association-owned property for 14 years with her two teenage daughters and 11-year-old son. 'Uncommon': Zoopla said an 'uncommon' flaw in the algorithm which assesses factors such as previous sale values, characteristics and size had led to the mistake . Facts: Crawshaws Road is part of a suburb just two miles north of Birmingham which had a population of 11,857 in the 2001 census . She said: 'It's very funny for Crawshaws Road to get mentioned alongside the posh neighbourhoods of Knightsbridge and Chelsea. 'We're a typical suburban street full of working class families, single mums like myself and council houses. We're enjoying the attention this has brought us.' Retired Chubb worker Keith Warren, 66, who has lived on the street since 1980, added: 'I'd be very happy if my house was worth that. 'I don't know where they've got that figure from. Mistake: Another resident Luke Norris, 29, said: 'I'd love it if my house was worth £3.6million but they've obviously made a mistake' 'I've seen a lot of changes in the time I've lived here. 'The road was one of the first on the estate to be built so it used to be in the middle of a field. 'I used to drive down from Water Orton Lane through potato fields so it's a bit different nowadays.' Another resident Luke Norris, 29, added: 'I'd love it if my house was worth £3.6million but they've obviously made a mistake. 'You only need to look at the street to know that. 'I've lived here most of my life, but would have sold up if my house was worth that much.' Zoopla said an 'uncommon' flaw in the algorithm which assesses factors such as previous sale values, characteristics and size had led to the mistake. Value: £300million . Bedrooms: 45 . Bathrooms: Unknown . Mod cons: Gold leaf adorns many of the internal fittings. Bullet proof windows. Benefits: The 60,000sq/ft living space - only slightly smaller than a football pitch - includes a large swimming pool, industrial-size catering kitchen, underground parking and several lifts. Neighbours: London's wealthiest landlord the Duke of Westminster, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Value: £130,000 . Bedrooms: 3 . Bathrooms: 1 . Mod cons: Gas fired central heating, double glazing. Benefits: Close to the M6 and HS2 line makes the house handy for commuters.

'We have a rigorous system and process in place that continuously checks the data for any outliers such as the one you identified. 'This over-inflated estimate was in a queue to be manually checked. 'The estimate for the street is actually £125,619 and we have now updated this to reflect a more accurate average property value for that street .

"By . Chris Spargo For Mailonline . A Wall Street financier has completed the Ice Bucket Challenge in the most luxurious manner yet, filming himself as he jumps into a freezing tub at his $23.6 million penthouse in downtown Manhattan. Richard B. Handler, the chief executive of the investment bank Jefferies Group and its parent company, the Leucadia National Corporation, decided to skip the bucket all together as he took part in the challenge, which benefits the A.L.S. Association, and instead dunked himself in an icy bath. The video, which was uploaded on Tuesday, prominently showcases his apartment's stunning views of Manhattan. Scroll down for video . Richard B. Handler prepares to take the plunge for the Ice Bucket Challenge in the bathroom of his $23.6 million apartment, with features stunning views of Manhattan . 'There’s a special stipulation in this challenge, I’m not sure people are aware of it,' he says in the video. 'Instead of taking a bucket and dumping it on your head, if you put yourself and dump yourself into the bucket, you’re allowed to nominate four people instead of three people.' Handler, 52,nominated three other Wall Street execs; Tilman J. Fertitta, the CEO of Landry's, Inc.; Gerald Hassell, the CEO of The Bank of New York Mellon; and  Carl Icahn, the 78-year-old businessman whose net worth is $24.5 billion. Icahn took to Twitter to say he would get back to Handler on the challenge, but was currently 'too busy working on BIG deal with another investment banker.' For his fourth nomination, Handler selected rapper Armando Perez, better known as Pitbull. Handler before (pictured left) and after (pictured right) taking the freezing cold plunge . It was another financial bigwig, KCG Chief Executive Officer Daniel Coleman, who nominated Handler. Thanks in large part to the challenge, the A.L.S. Association has received $88.5 million in donations from late July through Tuesday, compared with $2.6 million in the period a year earlier. Handler, whose 2012 salary as CEO of the Jeffries firm was $58 million according to the Daily News, may however soon be losing a little bit of that gorgeous view from his 14th-Floor penthouse, as there is a proposal to build a two-story rooftop restaurant nearby.

Handler's apartment building is almost entirely glass, and provides sweeping 360-degree views of Manhattan . He sued the landlord of 50 Varick Street and the Department of Buildings in March of last year, alleging the restaurant flouted zoning guidelines. 'The project will significantly obstruct the panoramic river views from his apartment,' Handler's lawyer said in their lawsuit. If the plan goes through, Handler would lose part of his view of New Jersey.","Richard B.

"By . Ben Spencer . A key report on the impact of fracking was censored 63 times in just 13 pages. Even the author's name was among the redactions by Whitehall officials, which have been described as 'comical' by campaigners. The internal report, written in March by Defra's Rural Community Policy Unit, has now brought fresh accusations that the Government has something to hide over the effects of shale gas exploration. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Protestors and police clash again to prevent vehicles entering the fracking site at Balcombe in Sussex . Deleted sections included eight from the executive summary, four from the chapter on economic impacts, four from the section on social impacts, and 17 from the analysis of the impact on local services. The chapter examining the effect of drilling on house prices had three sections cut. Only three paragraphs survive in the conclusion. Even a summary of previous research is heavily censored – despite the original studies being freely available to the public. Defra – the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – claimed yesterday that there was a 'strong public interest' in withholding all the information so officials could consider the issue without 'closing down discussion'. It gave copies of the report to the Environment Agency. But Green Party MP Caroline Lucas accused the Government of wilfully withholding negative data about fracking – the process by which shale gas is extracted from rock. 'This report would be comical if it was not so serious,' she told Radio 4's Today show. 'The only conclusion you can draw from looking at this report is that the Government has something to hide and we need to know what that is.' Green Party MP Caroline Lucas (centre) has accused the Government of wilfully withholding negative data about fracking . The document, entitled Shale Gas: Rural Economy Impacts, was released after an environmental information request – similar to a Freedom of Information request. One section that remains intact refers to a 2010 study which found the value of properties near a well in Texas fell by up to 14 per cent. A Government spokesman last night said there is no evidence that house prices would be affected by fracking, adding that it will provide energy security, growth and jobs. Defra said the decision to redact was made by civil servants alone. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham has already said he will not tolerate the censorship of embarrassing reports and is seeking a review of a study into the HS2 high speed rail project.","Even  author's name was among redactions by Whitehall officials .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . American fur designer Dennis Basso is launching a collection of luxury clothing for girls aged four to 12; which includes a sable fur coat priced at an eye-watering £30,000. 'In today’s world, we’re getting to a point where people are doing what they want to do,' Mr Basso, 60, told WWD. 'For some, it’s too much. For others, it’s not.' The collection, which will debut this autumn at Harrods in London - Europe's largest and most extravagant department store - also features a £2,500 embroidered party dress. Pricy: Renowned couture designer Dennis Basso is launching a collection for girls aged four to 12, which includes a sable fur coat (pictured) for £30,000 . His dark brown, knee-swinging coat is crafted from the skin and fur of a sable - fluffy Russian mammals which somewhat resemble stoats or ferrets - and is modelled by a pretty but decidedly sulky-looking young girl. Mr Basso - who launched his business 31 years ago selling animal pelts out of the trunk of a rented car, and now counts Debra Messing, Mary J Blige and Olivia Palermo as customers - correctly identifies that his kids collection is not to be larked around in. 'These are not the kind of clothes to go to school in or to go out and play in,' he said. 'These are dresses for special occasions and weddings.' Flash: 'In today's world, we're getting to a point where people are doing what they want to do,' Mr Basso, 60, said. 'For some, it's too much. For others, it's not' Why so glum? The Fall collection also features a £2,500 embroidered party dress (pictured) High tea: The pricy range will sell at Harrods in London, Europe's largest and most extravagant department store . The line is sprinkled with beading and feather embellishments and Mr Basso says he has attempted to translate the same 'quality and sophistication' over from his women's collection, which has its flagship store on New York's Madison Avenue, and sells for tens of thousands of dollars. 'These are not the kind of clothes to go to school in or to go out and play in' Mr Basso, who is married to long-time partner Michael Cominotto, is on the board for a number of children's charities, and holds them particularly close to his heart. He claims he designed the collection after attending numerous social events and noticing a lack of suitable attire for young girls.

Happy is not an adjective animal rights campaigners PETA would use to describe Mr Basso's latest fashion endeavour. 'Sales of fur and other animal skins are on a continuous decline' 'Dennis Basso fails to understand that children have a natural empathy for animals, so his fur coats for young girls couldn't be more out of touch,' PETA director Colleen O'Brien tells MailOnline. 'Sales of fur and other animal skins are on a continuous decline, as more and more people see PETA's videos of fur farms. 'Many don't want to contribute to the suffering of animals who are confined to cramped, filthy cages for life and then finally drowned, beaten to death, strangled, electrocuted, or even skinned alive.

"AR Wear has launched an online crowd funding campaign to help get its creation off the ground . The brand has been met with criticism, as some sites say that rape proof underwear is in no way a solution to the issue of sexual abuse . By . Daily Mail Reporter . A new line of anti-rape underwear named AR Wear uses modern chastity belt-type technology to ward off potential sexual predators. Unlike the electric shock anti-rape underwear introduced in spring, AR Wear locks wearers into the gear with cut-proof, adjustable straps that don’t leave underwear lines. It is currently being vetted online through a crowd funding campaign. Cut-proof: AR Wear's adjustable straps are incredibly difficult to cut or rip open . AR Wear’s creation is meant to give wearers a sense of comfort while running at night, travelling alone, going out to a nightclub, as well as other ‘risky’ environs, as is explained in a promotional video.The project has already raised $37,000 of its requested $50,000 budget on crowd sourcing site Indiegogo, with 17 days left of seed funding to go. The project was founded by two Nyack, New York-based young women named Ruth and Yuval, who say they have carried out years of research before launching their Indiegogo campaign. They admit on their site that ‘only by raising awareness and education, as well as bringing rapists to justice, can we all hope to eventually accomplish the goal of eliminating rape as a threat to both women and men.’ Pull-proof: AR Wear's pants are difficult to pull down, once locked into place . The page continues to explain: ‘Meanwhile, as long as sexual predators continue to populate our world, AR Wear would like to provide products to women and girls that will offer better protection against some attempted rapes while the work of changing society's rape culture moves forward.’ While AR Wear bills itself on . providing safe alternatives to women who feel threatened or want a bit . of added safety to go out, its designs have been met with controversy . online. Website The Daily Dot . wrote: ‘These ideas for anti-rape clothing never go anywhere, and . that’s because preventing rape has nothing to do with what a woman is . wearing, or not wearing, and everything to do with the rapist and a . culture of victim-blaming.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Four soldiers in an iconic First World War image that was widely used for morale-boosting posters and postcards have finally been identified. The official war photograph - titled 'Tommy at home in German dugouts' - shows soldiers from the Border Regiment resting in a trench during a lull in the Somme offensive in 1916. Very little was known about the origins of the picture, however, until a relative of one of the men saw the image in coverage of the recent First World War centenary, and came forward to confirm his identity. Iconic image: The four British soldiers, with Norman Park on the far left, on the morale-boosting postcard . Familiar face: Sylvia Nichol (right) saw the picture during the War's centenary and recognised her grandfather . Sylvia Nichol, from Over Kellet, near Carnforth, Lancashire, said the sergeant on the left of the picture was her grandfather Norman Park, who was born in nearby Kendal. She named the other men in the trench as, from left, L/Cpl Tattersall, Dan Daly and E Carradice. The only person she had no name for was a soldier laid across the top of the dugout, who was cropped out of the photograph when it was used as a postcard by the Ministry of Information. Mrs Nichol believed the photograph was taken at Ovillers on the Somme in July 1916 - although the Imperial War Museum dates the image a month later. Sergeant: Mr Park was born in Kendal, Cumbria, and served in the Border Regiment in the First World War . 'Stern father figure': Mr Park with his wife Mabel and, right, standing proudly in his Army uniform . The Battle of the Somme took place between July 1 and November 18, 1916 in the Somme area of France . It began with an offensive by British and French forces against the Germans, which, since invading France in August 1914, had occupied large areas of the country. The Allies gained little ground over the four-month battle - just five miles in total by the end. The battle is controversial because of the tactics employed, and is also historically significant as tanks were used for the first time. On the first day of fighting the British lost more than 19,000 men, rising to 420,000 in total. By the time fighting ceased there were more than 1 million casualties, including 650,000 Germans. With the British troops posing in captured German trenches, the photograph was adopted for morale-boosting propaganda and given the title 'Tommy at home in German dugouts'. 'I sort of knew about the photo years ago before I ever saw a copy,' said Mrs Nichol, who remembered Mr Park as 'a happy smiling granddad'. 'My dad told the tale of when he came home on leave in the Second World War from Belgium or Germany. He got off the train at Euston station and looking out at him from a poster on the wall was his old man.' Mrs Nichol's sister Sue Streadwick, who emigrated to Canada, was also aware of the picture and for years has had a copy hanging in her home. She said: 'I was raised by my grandfather, so have memories of him as a stern father-figure, more than as a soldier. 'He was born in Kendal, the seventh and youngest son in a family of nine children. His father ran a building business and built the houses on Park Street and vicinity. 'He took part in the Battle of the Somme and suffered gas poisoning. He was sent home as an invalid, and often lamented that he had an 'easy way out' of the war. Laying low: The original picture had a fifth soldier, draped across the top of the German trench . Calling card: A colour-enhanced version of the postcard that was issued by the Ministry of Information . 'When World War Two came around, he joined the Territorial Army and held the rank of captain.' Mrs Streadwick added that he had two children and worked at Ibis engineering as a purchaser. He drank at the Ring O' Bells, loved cricket, grew vegetables, was a Mason and was 'an active and caring grandfather'.","Little was known about identity of the soldiers in the widely-used image .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Black-and-white photographs from the First World War are not hard to come by, but far less familiar are the colour images from the time. ‘The First . World War in Colour’ contains more than 320 colour photos brought . together from archives in Europe, the United States and Australia. They were taken by a small band of photographers at the time who were pioneering autochrome technology when the war began. The . process of taking colour photos back in 1914 required quite a long . exposure time, so almost every picture shows carefully composed scenes . of soldiers  preparing for battle, day-to-day life in the trenches and the devastating consequences on the front line. Their remarkable fully-hued pictures have now been published in time for the centenary, bringing a human reality to the ‘war to end war’. The volume by author Peter Walther includes some of the most important developments of the war including the mobilisation of 1914 to the victory celebrations in Paris, London and New York in 1919. It was possible to take colour photos as early as the 19th century and the autochrome technique was introduced in 1907 before even new technology in the 1930s made colour photography more mainstream. More than nine million soldiers and seven million civilians were killed in the First World War, which started on July 28, 1914 and ended on November 11, 1918. Hundreds of events are taking place throughout this year to mark 100 years since the war began. Scroll down for video .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It's a job for the flying squad, at the very least a member of the Old Bill who won’t duck a challenge. Officers at Sutton Coldfield Police Station were called out at 7am to help mallard Matilda and her six ducklings who were stranded outside a pub in the West Midlands town. Two officers were dispatched to the Bottle of Sack pub after the manager became concerned that the family of ducks were risking their lives crossing a busy road to reach a nearby brook. Help from the old bill: Two police officers help Matilda and her ducklings cross the road in Sutton Coldfield . The hardest part was rounding them up in the pub's beer garden; after that they did as the policemen told them . Caroline Wrenn, who runs the Wetherspoons pub, said the mallard moved into the pub garden five months ago and has already raised one family of ducklings there without a problem. But when she watched the latest brood try their luck at crossing the road, she decided it was time to call the police. She said: 'To start with, I think they thought it was a hoax, but when the officers arrived, they were marvellous. 'Finding all the chicks in the beer garden was the hardest part.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Police detained six Romanian prostitutes yesterday following raids on two brothels in London. Two women were found in a semi-detached house two doors away from a church in Harrow, north west London, while another four were caught in a flat above a charity shop near Rayners Lane Tube station. 'Crystal', 26 and a mother-of-three, was caught having sex with a client when police arrived at the first property. Mother-of-three 'Crystal', 26, was caught having sex with a client in a house just two doors away from a church in Harrow, north west London . She said she left her toddler twins and eight-month-old baby with a nanny while she worked a 12 hour shift. Police detained six prostitute during the raids, but as the women are here legally and their clients will not provide sworn statements, they were released with a caution . Speaking to the Daily Express, she said: 'I left Romania because it is very bad and here I can earn good money - sometimes £2,000 a week. 'I do it for a better life for me and my children. When I am with a customer the only thing I think about is my children.' She added that she didn't want to stay in London, and was only raising enough money to move back home and start a business. In the second brothel 'Sally', 24, who has a four-year-old son, said she needs the money to survive, but tells her boyfriend she works as a cleaner because otherwise he would kill her. All the women said they had left behind abject poverty in Romania for a better life in the UK, and claimed they had looked for legitimate work but were turned down because of their race. Police closed the brothels, but only gave the women formal warning as they are all here legally and it is unlikely that any of their clients would testify against them leading to criminal charges. Officers also found a stash of illegal tobacco and alcohol worth thousands of pounds in separate raids on several corner shops. Harrow has become a magnet for Eastern European immigrants to the UK, with 5,000 already said to be living in the borough. These women, aged between 21 and 26, were found in a flat above a charity shop and say they left behind abject poverty for a better life in the UK . Despite that Dr Ion Jinga , Romanian ambassador to London, claims the predicted rush of his countrymen to the UK after EU border controls were relaxed has not happened. The diplomat also says that ten companies have contacted his London embassy trying to get Romanians to work for them, and they have been forced to direct them to the Jobcentre.","Police detained six prostitutes yesterday after raids in London .

"By . Tara Brady . Brighton College headteacher Richard Cairns said he would like to see a minimum standard introduced for teachers . Top schools are finding it difficult to recruit would-be headteachers because job applications are littered with basic mistakes. Covering letters and CVs are often ‘really badly completed’ with appalling spelling and grammar, according to Emma Knights, head of the National Governors' Association. Many candidates often fail to use the correct spelling for the school they are writing to. According to recent figures one in four schools are struggling to employ senior staff. 'Sometimes, it's basic grammar that's wrong', Ms Knights told The Times. 'You don't expect a school leader to be told to put the apostrophe in the right place, or to check that their capital letters are in the right place, or they've got the school name right.' Last month the head of a leading independent school released examples of job applications he had received which exposed the sloppiness and poor standards of literacy among candidates. Brighton College’s Richard Cairns received 50 letters for the position of deputy head. Of the 30 from people working at state schools, he said 12 were ‘semi-literate’ and only one made the shortlist. According to Mr Cairns, some candidates were unsure how to address him in applications. One history teacher said he liked 'to see a student bossom' while a chemistry teacher gave his date of birth as 1053. Mr Cairns also said that many teachers between 25 and 40 who were taught in state schools were never taught basic grammar, spelling and sentence structure. The head called for a minimum standard to be introduced in which teachers would have to achieve at least three B grades at A-level, and a 2:1 degree in their chosen teaching subject. According to Mr Cairns some candidates were unsure how to address him in job applications . The Department for Education said a growing network of teaching schools was helping to ‘identify teachers with potential for headship’. 'I like to see a student bossom' 'I have been a science teacher form more than 10 years' 'Date of birth: 1053' 'Dear Cairns' 'Dear Mr Richard' The National Governors' Association is a charity for 300,000 volunteers who act as school governors, who appoint head teachers. In December 2013, a new international study revealed that British pupils lag behind leading nations including Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and the Chinese city of Shanghai. The study was carried out as part of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and focused on applied skills rather than theoretical knowledge. The findings show that the UK's average score for maths was 494 and in reading it was 499, roughly average for all countries and on a par with the Czech Republic, France and Norway. Britain did better in science with an above-average 514 points, similar to Australia, Ireland and Slovenia. Official figures have shown that one-in-five of state secondary school maths teachers in England do not have a maths degree, with the same being true of 34 per cent of physics teachers.","Emma Knights is head of the National Governors' Association .

Joanna Barrientos, 36, and her stepdaughter Mia Lopez, 5, were discovered shot to death Saturday night in the town of Hemet. Johnny Lopez, 36, Joanna's estranged husband, was arrested Saturday in connection to the double homicide and attempted murder of another woman. Scroll down for video . Monstrous crime: Johnny Lopez (left) is accusing of shooting dead his biological daughter, 5-year-old Mia, and his estranged wife, Joanna Barrientos (right) Crime scene: The bodies of the woman and child were discovered in their Hemet home . According to a relative, the slain victims were not blood relatives, but Miss Barrientos cared for Mia and treated her as her own daughter, KTLA reported. Sheriff's deputies got a call at around 9.13pm Saturday from Barrientos' mother, Annie Copado, who said that two dead bodies were inside a home in the 26000 block of Girard Street in Hemet. An hour earlier, deputies responded to a home in the 40000 block of Sunset Lane, about a mile away from the second crime scene, where they discovered a woman suffering from stab wounds and lacerations to her neck. She was taken to a hospital in critical condition. Johnny Lopez was arrested a short time later on Sunset Lane after being spotted standing on the street covered in blood. The 36-year-old allegedly put up a fight but was taken into custody after a brief struggle. In cold blood: A relative said little Mia and her stepmother were likely killed as they slept .

John Bustos told the station that the deadly incident may be related to drugs. The man added that Mia's death may have been prevented if only child services acted on his earlier report asking the agency to remove the girl from her parents' home. Johnny Lopez has been charged with murder with malice, multiple homicides and attempted murder. He is being held without bail pending his arrangement, which is scheduled for Thursday, MyFox LA reported. Deputies said both incidents appear to be related.

"By . Elizabeth Sanderson . Game: The Duke of Edinburgh on a shoot in Suffolk in 2008. He has recently been joining shooting parties at Balmoral to regain his strength following surgery . It’s a particularly regal form of recuperation. Since arriving at Balmoral three weeks ago, Prince Philip has been joining the shooting parties at the Scottish estate in a bid to regain his strength after undergoing major surgery. The Duke of Edinburgh had an exploratory abdominal operation in June, spending 11 days in hospital followed by a two-month period of convalescence at Sandringham. The 92-year-old is now back on his feet and, according to a source, has been enjoying grouse shoots at the Royal Family’s retreat. The source said: ‘Philip goes on all the shoots. He says he’s feeling fine. He only goes out for half a day and then joins the Queen for lunch.’ The Duke, a formidable shot, was told to give up shooting after a heart scare in December 2011 because doctors feared the recoil could dislodge a stent fitted to unblock a coronary artery. Prince Philip was said to have accepted their advice reluctantly in the hope that it was on a temporary basis. Last night, Palace officials claimed the Duke had not picked up a gun in two years, although they admitted he still enjoys accompanying shooting parties. In fact, he is believed to have gone on a hare shoot earlier this year. The source said: ‘He goes out in the morning and insists he’s now on the mend.’ The Queen traditionally spends the summer at the 50,000-acre estate and is usually joined for the duration by her husband, while other members of the Royal Family drop in. This year, Philip arrived on August 12 – the first day of the grouse season – more than a fortnight after the Queen as he was not well enough to travel. Prince Edward, Prince Andrew, the Duchess of York and Princess Beatrice have all been to stay. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are also expected to introduce baby George to the Duke of Edinburgh within the next three weeks. Philip is the only member of the Royal Family not to have met the new arrival. Prince Philip leaves the London Clinic in central London, in June, 11 days after he was admitted for exploratory abdominal surgery .","Duke of Edinburgh has an exploratory abdominal operation in June .

"By . Martin Robinson . Tragic: Flt Lt Sean Cunningham, 35, died on the runway at RAF Scampton near Lincoln in 2011 because of a defective ejector seat . A Red Arrows pilot who died when his ejector seat went off unexpectedly was failed by a manufacturer who knew it was defective for more than 20 years but did not tell the RAF, a coroner said today. Flight Lieutenant Sean . Cunningham's seat's firing handle was in the wrong . position when the airman entered the cockpit, and went off while he was on the ground. The Iraq veteran was hurled up to . 300ft into the air before plunging to the ground at the RAF aerobatics . team's base at RAF Scampton, near Lincoln. Following a three-week inquest, Central Lincolnshire coroner Stuart Fisher recorded a narrative verdict and said: 'There was a very serious failure of communication by . Martin Baker (the manufacturer) in my view'. Mr Fisher described a safety pin that goes through the . firing handle as 'entirely useless' and said its presence was 'likely to . mislead'. 'The seat's designer and manufacturers had failed to appreciate the consequent risk of incorrect pin provision,' he said. RAF personnel missed 19 chances to spot . that the ejection seat was in an unsafe position and the pin was incorrectly housed, the inquest heard. The coroner also said that Martin Baker was aware of issues with the . over-tightening of crucial nuts and bolts in the mechanism of the seat . which would cause the main parachute not to deploy properly. However . despite being aware of these issues since 1990, Martin Baker failed to . pass on the warnings to the Ministry of Defence, the coroner said. When Flight Lieutenant Sean . Cunningham was fired into the air but the main parachute on the Mk 10 Martin Baker seat, which should have saved . his life, failed to deploy and he suffered multiple injuries. The . inquest has heard that to trigger the 1960s ejection seat pilots must . pull the firing handle - fitted between their legs - sharply upwards. But . tests since the tragedy revealed that if the handle was 'locked' in a . certain position, a slight downward pressure would unexpectedly launch . the ejection seat. Damage: The jet pictured on the tarmac at RAF Scampton after the ejector seat had fired . Hero: Comrades carry Flight Lieutenant Cunningham at his funeral, who was shot 300ft into the air and his parachute failed to deploy, leaving him fatally injured . The coroner said: 'Automatic separation from the ejection seat and main parachute deployment failed to occur. 'Very shortly thereafter and when still retained in seat there followed a high- velocity impact with the ground from which he suffered no survivable injuries'. The coroner said Flt Lt Cunningham's fatal injuries were suffered as a result of his impact on the ground. Lawyers acting for the family today confirmed it had secured an . undisclosed settlement from the Ministry of Defence in December 2013 . following a full admission of liability for the incident in July that . year. Bereft: Sean's family paid tribute to him today but admitted it was difficult to accept the manner in which he died in 2011 . Speaking after the verdict, Flt Lt Cunningham's father Jim said: 'Our son Sean died aged 35 doing what he loved, which was flying with the Red Arrows. From the age of 17, he had wanted nothing more than to join the Royal Air Force and serve his country, which he did with utmost pride and sense of duty. 'He served a number of tours in Iraq flying Tornados in close air support of coalition forces. 'Sean's death was a tragedy which we hope the evidence revealed in this inquest will help to avoid in the future. 'We are very grateful to the coroner, Mr Fisher, for allowing a full exploration of how this tragic death occurred. 'We still find it difficult to accept that so many people could have missed, between Sean's last sortie on Friday and the following Tuesday, what should have been obvious to those having a duty to ensure the safety of the seat, and we remain unconvinced as to that aspect of the coroner's finding. 'Nevertheless, we accept that how the seat firing handle came to be in a position where it could be inadvertently activated may never be fully understood. 'We welcome the conclusions of the coroner, which confirm what we knew all along, which is that Sean was blameless and his tragic death was preventable. We therefore welcome the coroner's recommendations, which we hope and pray will ensure that no family such as ours has to endure such a pointless and avoidable death'. In a statement released after the hearing today, Air Commodore Terry Jones, speaking on behalf of the MoD, said: 'The tragic loss of Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham is still keenly felt by the Royal Air Force, the Red Arrows and all of Sean's former colleagues. 'Sean had an enthusiasm for flying and life that endeared him to all. His tragic accident has been a shattering blow to everyone on the team in particular. 'Now that the inquest into this tragic event has concluded it is time to reflect on what a wonderful man and pilot Sean was. We were extremely privileged to have known him and to have had him within our ranks.'","Flt Lt Sean Cunningham, 35, died on the runway at RAF Scampton, Lincoln .

"By . Peter Allen . An interview in which Colonel Gaddafi admits funding the election campaign of former president Nicolas Sarkozy will be broadcast across France today. It is expected to signal a massive crisis for Mr Sarkozy and his third wife Carla Bruni, who are already desperately trying to stave off a range of corruption investigations. The Gaddafi footage, shot in March 2011, shows the former Libyan dictator saying: 'Sarkozy is mentally deficient. It's thanks to me that he became president. We gave him the funds that allowed him to win.' Revelations: In the interview the late Colonel Gaddafi claims to have funded an election campaign for former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who he refers to as 'mentally deficient' The interview is expected to trigger another massive crisis for Sarkozy and his third wife Carla Bruni, who are already trying to stave off a range of corruption investigations . Sarkozy is accused of accepting millions of pounds in illegal payments from Gaddafi before inviting him on a state visit to the Elysee Palace in 2007. The pair acted like firm allies and friends before the Arab Spring uprising of early 2011, when Gaddafi's hold on power loosened. It was then that Sarkozy turned on his former friend - initiating Nato bombing raids on Libya which eventually ended with Gaddafi being killed. There are even well-sourced claims that Sarkozy personally ordered Gaddafi's killing because of fears that their corrupt dealings would be exposed. Sarkozy is consideirng running for president again in 2017 as incumbent Francois Hollande (pictured) is thought to be doing a bad job . Pouria Amirshahi, a leading Socialist politician in France, described the 'shameful' dealings as being 'akin to prostitution', saying ‘the possibility of corruption is very real.’ In the France 3 TV audio recording, to be broadcast today, Gaddafi said his move to finance Sarkozy was part of his political strategy. ‘For us, as Libyans, if the president of France wins elections thanks to our funds, it is a real advantage,’ Gaddafi told journalist Delphine Minoui. Gaddafi said Sarkozy personally asked him for financial support when he was still France's Interior Minister. Gaddafi, who ruled Libya for more than 40 years, was shot and stabbed to death by a baying mob, after the convoy he was travelling in was bombed by the French airforce. Sarkozy lost the 2012 presidential election to Francois Hollande, and the home he shares with Ms Bruni in Paris was raided by anti-corruption police soon afterwards. As president he was immune from prosecution, but he is now facing a range of enquires, most centring on the raising of illegal funds. Despite all this, Sarkozy is convinced he can run for president again in 2017 because of the disastrous job Hollande is doing as he tries to run France.","Footage shows Gaddafi saying Libya funded Sarkozy's election campaign .

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . Former First Sea Lord West said Britain needed to be very clear on its 'gameplan' in Iraq . Britain risks taking the ‘dangerous step’ of being dragged further into military action in Iraq, former top brass warned tonight. A retired commander cautioned ministers to properly think out any attack against Islamist jihadists who have spread a reign of terror over huge parts of northern Iraq. Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, spoke out after David Cameron said Britain would ‘use all the assets that we have’, including ‘military prowess’ and aid, to defeat Islamic State (IS) extremists. The Prime Minister insisted the UK would not deploy ‘boots on the ground’ but the Government is considering increasing the number of fast jets based in Cyprus capable of launching air strikes against the fanatics. IS, the extreme Sunni Islam group formerly known as ISIS, is seeking to build a so-called caliphate - a new Islamic state spanning Iraq and Syria. The brutal terrorist group, which is linked to Al Qaeda, has carried out a wave of atrocities including beheadings, crucifixions and abducting thousands of women and children. The RAF’s latest spy plane - the Rivet Joint – is already being used to carry out surveillance to help the US military identify potential IS targets and eight Tornado fighter planes at RAF Akrotiri, currently being used for surveillance, could easily switch to a bombing role. Nearly 200 Special Forces troops have also deployed to the region. But Lord West, a military grandee, warned ministers to be aware of the ‘unintended consequences’ of a military campaign. The former head of the Navy said: ‘We need to be very certain of our ultimate aim and we don’t seem to have great clarity of vision about what we are going to do there. It is very worrying. ‘There is always a danger of mission creep. We need to be very clear on our game plan - what, at the end, is going to make our nation and the globe more secure. ‘The problem with getting involved is there is no way you want to become fully involved. It would be a dangerous step to have troops on the ground. ‘But you look at what the Islamic State is doing and it is incumbent to do something. We should use limited military capabilities: reconnaissance capabilities, intelligence, possibly airstrikes and using Special Forces to mark targets for firing from drones. ‘The Islamic State is a huge threat to the region and we need to pushing for a very joined-up policy, dealing with our allies, getting people in the Middle East to get into line. ‘It does not help that Qatari money is pouring in to help Islamic State because they are Sunnis. A Peshmerga fighter flashes the sign for victory near Mosul, Iraq. Britain should use 'limited military capabilities' in the region, such as reconnaissance, airstrikes and special forces, Lord West said . ‘I don’t think some countries have fully grasped how dangerous the Islamic State is. We have got to get these people in a row.’ Lord West also hit out at the Coalition for making such deep defence cuts since coming to power in 2010. The Ministry of Defence has axed nearly 30,000 troops, warships, spy planes and fast jets in a bid to save billions of pounds. He said: ‘It is ironic that having had large cuts in defence spending over the past four years, and facing the distinct possibility of even more to come, that David Cameron is relying on the Armed Forces yet again. ‘He rightly says our forces are excellent – they are – but you can’t keep cutting, cutting, cutting military capability if then you want to use it.’ Defence Select Committee chairman Rory Stewart, a former coalition deputy governor in Iraq following the 2003 war, backed arming the Kurds, but warned that their fighting forces needed significant reforms. He added: ‘It is not just a humanitarian thing anymore. Arming the Kurds is taking a military position against the Islamic State. But before we do any of this we need far, far more information. ‘The lesson, above all, of our last intervention in Iraq is we have got to focus on what we can do.’","Former Navy commander warns of dangers of 'mission creep' in Iraq .

Horrific: Jeremy and Christine Moody (seen in court today) admitted to killing a sex offender and his wife and though they are self-proclaimed 'skinheads' they say that the local white supremacist group that they are affiliated with did not have a role in the murders . Appalling: The couple said later after the sentencing that they had a second sex offender target in mind and added that the female victim was 'a casualty of war' since they really wanted to kill her sex offender husband . Delusions: Jeremy Moody's lawyer said that at the time of the slaying, he 'felt he was the right hand of God' Acted alone: Though they had personal connections to a local supremacist group, Crew 41, which the Southern Poverty Law Center notes has a history of targeting sex offenders, the Moodys claimed that the Parkers murder had nothing to do with the group. Pictured are Jeremy and Christine Moody's mugshots from their July arrests in Union County . They were unrepentant at the sentencing on Tuesday and even kissed after being sentenced to two consecutive life sentences each. Initially, Jeremy and Christine Moody apologised to the judge and asked for a 30-year sentence so they could see their children and grow old together. But after Union County Judge Lee Alford handed down the maximum punishment, they showed how they really felt. 'See you perverts later,' Jeremy Moody shouted at Charles Parker's family as he walked out of court. 'That's what child molesters get.' 'They got exactly what they deserve,' Jeremy also told reporter. 'Had to do it over again, I'd kill more.' 'I think Jeremy and I would have done it again if given the opportunity,' Christine Moody said to reporters. 'I have no regrets. Killing that pedophile was the best day of my life.' If authorities had not acted fast enough, they may have: Christine Moody said that they had another sex offender in mind as their third victim but were caught in connection to the Parker killings before they could strike again. The Moodys plead guilty to murder, kidnapping, burglary and firearm possession. Though they had personal connections to a local supremacist group, Crew 41, which the Southern Poverty Law Center notes has a history of targeting sex offenders, the Moodys claimed that the Parkers murder had nothing to do with the group. Happy for themselves: The couple smiled and kissed one another as they were awarded consecutive life sentences in a Union County, South Carolina court on Tuesday for the July murder of Marvin and Gretchen Parker . Medical conditions: Jeremy Moody's lawyer says he is bipolar and schizophrenic (left) while Christine Moody is said to have PTSD and borderline personality disorder (right) Union County Sheriff David Taylor told the SPLC that Jeremy shot both of the victims while Christine slit the wife's throat after they told Parker and his wife exactly why they were going to kill them. A surveillance camera on Parker's land caught them leaving, and deputies recognised Jeremy Moody from the word 'skinhead' tattooed on his neck and the 'Made in America' tattoo on the side of his head. Lawyers said both defendants were sexually abused as children and that made them want revenge against the type of people who hurt them. They believed they had a divine assignment to kill all sex offenders, said psychologist Harold Morgan, who analyzed Jeremy Moody. After he was arrested, Jeremy Moody directed investigators to a sheet of paper in his home. He wrote the name and address of another sex offender, telling police he was going to kill that person the next day if he had not been arrested. The Parkers were killed on a Sunday and he planned the next murder for that Wednesday. Brackett said the Moodys had no right to act as a judge and a jury after Parker had already served a sentence for taking advantage of a disabled woman. 'I'm going to tell you, she's cold as hell,' Sheriff Taylor said of Christine Moody. 'She wants to get the glory.' Crew 41 is believed to be a loosely . associated group that connects largely online, but they had their first . meet-and-greet scheduled for August in Nebraska, and the Moodys . apparently planned to attend after the July 21 double murder. Sheriff . Taylor went on to explain that Christine Moody, who was 36-years-old at . the time of the murder, said that Gretchen Parker 'was a casualty of . war'. Target: Marvin Charles Parker (left) and his wife Gretchen Dawn Parker (right) were killed in their home in July and the Moodys said Marvin's sex offender status is what led them to target him . Outside of reading the 69th Psalm from the Bible and letters from their church members, the couple showed little remorse. They smiled and looked longingly at each other during the hearing. Jeremy . Moody smirked as members of the Parker family asked the judge for the . maximum sentence. When the judge asked Christina Moody the standard . question of whether anyone offered her anything for plea, she answered . 'just fame and fortune.' The couple told authorities they had killed others, but investigators found no evidence of other crimes, Brackett said. Defense . lawyers pointed out Christine Moody was a breast cancer survivor who . underwent a double mastectomy four years ago and Jeremy Moody suffered . from schizophrenia and was not on his medicine when the killings took . place. When Moody, who was 30 at the time of the . murder, does not take his prescribed medication, he suffers from . paranoia and delusions, according to his attorney Harry Dest. Christine Moody has her own share of . medical conditions, in addition to cancer she has borderline . personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and antisocial . personality disorder. Parker's family . didn't hear Jeremy Moody call them perverts because they were already . being taken out of the courtroom. They shrugged off his words outside. 'He . got what he deserved. He would kill again if he was let out,' said . Charles Parker's sister Brenda Franklin. 'He can say whatever he wants. He's dying in prison.' In this particular instance, Moody believed that he was acting as 'the right hand of God'. According to the local Fox station, Charles Parker was listed as a registered sex offender after being convicted in 2003 of third-degree criminal sexual conduct involving a 31-year-old woman and was also convicted in a sexual assault case involving a child in 1991.","Jeremy and Christine Moody admitted to killing Marvin and Gretchen Parker in July 2013 and the Moodys were sentenced today .

"By . Sara Malm . Swimming champion Ian Thorpe has left a rehab facility and has gone home after spending two days being treated for alcohol abuse and depression, Australian news reports. The five-time Olympic gold medallist has long been battling what he himself called ‘crippling depression’ in his 2013 biography, and was admitted to a Sydney hospital Wednesday. It has been reported that the 31-year-old Australian athlete left hospital early on Friday morning, after being injured in a fall at his parents’ house in a Sydney suburb, where he has been staying since returning to his home country over Christmas. Breaking his silence: Ian Thorpe has taken to Twitter to congratulate Torah Bright for her silver medal at the Winter Olympics . Just last week, Mr Thorpe was seen smiling and joking at model and long-time friend Tahyna Tozzi’s wedding, and celebrated Australia Day at a party surrounded by friends. However, the happy exterior has been hiding several years of trouble, something which Mr Thorpe described in his biography This Is Me: The Autobiography. He revealed that at some of the worst times he turned to alcohol in a bid to quell the thoughts running about his head. 'It was the only way I could get to sleep,' he wrote. 'It didn't happen every night, but there were numerous occasions, particularly between 2002 and 2004 as I trained to defend my Olympic titles in Athens, that I abused myself this way - always alone and in a mist of disgrace.' Thorpe says in the book that he was able to hide the effects of alcohol from team-mates and coaches and continued to enjoy one of the best periods of his career, despite his private battle with depression. Stuggle: Thorpe was seen at the wedding of long-time friend Tahyna Tozzi last week . Back to the start: After spending nearly 18 months in Switzerland, Mr Thorpe returned to Australia just before Christmas and has been staying with his parents in Sydney . Dry side: After failing to make a comeback in the 2012 Olympics in London, Thorpe (centre) became a pundit for the BBC alongside Clare Balding (right) and Mark Foster (left) The swimmer said he also felt the need to stay silent about his depression, thinking it was a 'character flaw'. 'Not even my family is aware that I've spent a lot of my life battling what I can only describe as a crippling depression.’ He admits in the book that he is ready to speak to his parents about his depression, but this is the first time he has been reported to have sought treatment. ‘Yes, it's serious but there's not a lot I can or want to add,’ broadcaster Alan Jones, a close friend of Ian Thorpe told the Herald Sun. ‘Ian is a beautiful person but he has difficulty recognising his problems.’ Australian swimming hero: Five-time gold medalist Ian Thorpe is in an intensive care ward in Sydney, and close associates are gravely concerned for his welfare . The 31-year-old dominated the shorter freestyle distances for several years after winning his first World Championship in 1998, aged 14 . Surgery complications: A report in Sydney's media claims that the swimmer contracted a 'bug' after surgery that threatens the use of his left arm . After becoming the world's youngest male World Champion in the 1998 Perth World Championships, he dominated the shorter freestyle distances for several years. He still holds the records of most Olympic gold medals won by an Australian (five) and became the first person to win six golds in one championship in 2001. He took a break from swimming in 2004, after the Athens Olympics, but failed to make a comeback two years later due to illness and chose instead to retire. He attempted a comeback ahead of the London 2012 Olympics but only made it to the second day of Australia's Olympic Trials in Adelaide, and instead worked as a pundit for the BBC during the games. Shortly after London 2012 he moved to Switzerland, but returned to Australia in December last year.","'Thorpedo' admitted to Sydney hospital on Wednesday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Billionaire: Tom Perkins, worth $8bn, compared criticism of the super rich to the Holocaust . A California multimillionaire has attracted ridicule after the Wall Street Journal published his letter comparing criticism of super-rich Americans to the Holocaust. Venture capitalist Thomas Perkins, who is thought to be worth around $8billion, wrote to the paper  from San Francisco, where a class war is currently brewing over rich tech employees who are driving up the city's cost of living. He opened his letter to the paper: 'Writing from the epicenter of progressive thought, San Francisco, I would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its ""one percent,"" namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the ""rich.' Mr Perkins describing the hatred attracted by Google workers in San Francisco and an incident in which his former wife author Danielle Steele was branded a 'snob' in the San Francisco Chronicle in a row over the height of her hedge. He then added: 'This is a very dangerous drift in our American thinking. Kristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendent ""progressive"" radicalism unthinkable now?' Kristallnacht translates as 'The night of broken glass' and refers to coordinated attacks on Jews in Germany on November 9 1938, as authorities looke on and did nothing. Superyacht: Mr Perkins commissioned the $150m yacht Maltese Falcon which he later sold . Mr Perkins, 82, was educated at MIT before gaining an MBA from Harvard. He founded Venture capitalist firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1973 and has served as a director on boards of companies including Compaq. He recently spent $150million building a super yacht called Maltese Falcon and lives on a 60th floor, 5,500ft penthouse overlooking San Francisco Bay. Comparisons: Mr Perkins referenced the Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in Germany in 1938 . Protests: Mr Perkins also discusses the protests in San Francisco against Google buses and tech workers driving up the area's cost of living . Before that, he was a general manager credited with building Hewlett Packard into the huge company it is known as today and started a successful laser company based on his own invention. His comments comparing criticism of the rich to the Nazis persecution of the Jews that resulted in six million deaths have attracted ridicule from many. Kaili Joy Gray wrote on the Wonkette blog: 'The parallel of Nazi Germany and some people getting kind of annoyed by the tech bro dudes is exactly ZERO.' Author and New York Times writer Steven Greenhouse tweeted: 'As someone who lost numerous relatives to the Nazi gas chambers, I find statements like this revolting & inexplicable.'","Thomas Perkins, 82, wrote of the 'parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its [San Francisco's] war on its ""one per cent""

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . Nick Kyrgios managed to override his emotional outbursts to defeat classy Russian Mikhail Youzhny on his Flushing Meadows main-draw debut at the US Open but admits he needs to curb his on-court antics. Kyrgios backed up his Wimbledon slaying of Rafael Nadal in a stirring 7-5 7-6 (7-4) 2-6 7-6 (7-1) victory over the world no.23 player on Monday with an impressive 26 aces and 68 winners in the four-set demolition. But the 19-year-old Australian stood just one point away from being forfeited after being hit with three code violations during the tense and high-quality three-hour encounter on Show Court 17. Scroll down for video . Nick Kyrgios's managed to override his emotional outbursts to defeat classy Russian Mikhail Youzhny on his Flushing Meadows main-draw debut at the US Open . But the 19-year-old Australian stood just one point away from being forfeited after being hit with three code violations during the tense and high-quality three-hour encounter on Show Court 17 . Kyrgios smashed a ball out of the stadium in frustration during the second set, then dropped the F-bomb before being docked a game in the fourth set for a second audible obscenity. Kyrgios conceded his tantrums probably didn't add to his performance and that he was trying to eliminate them from his game . 'Most players never even see that (game) penalty. I've seen it,' tennis superbrat John McEnroe said while commentating on American television. In Kyrgios's defence, he was only penalised a game - to fall behind 3-1 in the set - because his third offence came on game point against him. Unfazed, he held his next service game to love before breaking back to advance to the second round in an otherwise stellar performance. Kyrgios conceded his tantrums probably didn't add to his performance and that he was trying to eliminate them from his game. 'It just comes from having high expectations most of the time,' he said. 'I have been an emotional player most of my career. Maybe I will be able to manage it in the future. 'It's a work in progress. It's something that's always been there.' However, Youzhny, one of the tour's elder statesmen and a two-time Open semi-finalist, felt Kyrgios's behaviour was little more than a display of passion and youthful exuberance. 'He's young. I mean, it's normal. It's emotion, it's everything,' Youzhny said. 'He looks like he has lots of emotions. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it's not (helping).' Kyrgios admitted before the tournament he was feeling the weight of expectation from Australia and said Monday's dummy spits were 'I guess just heat of the moment'. 'I was frustrated the way I was playing, and, yeah, it was just all that sort of stuff,' he said. 'It was just an outburst, and hopefully I will be able to control that the next time I play.' While Youzhny tipped a bright future for the former world junior champion. 'He played well. We saw already at Wimbledon how he can play,' the Russian said. 'He beat some good players and I think if he works hard he will have a good future.' Russian Mikhail Youzhny tipped a bright future for Kyrgios and put this on-court behaviour down to passion .

"Former Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland has found himself at the center of an alleged mistaken identity scandal . Police who thought they had arrested former Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland have been left with egg on their faces - after it was revealed they had in fact been duped by a bold lookalike. A man who was arrested for burglary and drug possession on July 26 managed to convince cops he was the famous rocker for a month - and the truth only came out after the real deal posted a video of himself in the recording studio on his Facebook page. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department even went so far as to give gossip website TMZ a release stating that they had the 46-year-old singer in custody, and it was the resulting story that led Weiland to prove the only place he was locked up was in the studio. The written statement, titled 'Celebrity . Arrest', read: 'The suspect, former Stone Temple Pilots band member . Scott Weiland (46 years of age), was taken into custody for burglary and . possession of a controlled substance.' The department confirmed last night through analysing fingerprints that the man was in fact a 44-year-old man named Jason Michael Hurley, who is believed to bear an uncanny residence to Weiland. 'It's a lie,' said Weiland in the video, as he sat . flanked by backup singers The Wildabouts. 'I've actually been . touring, writing and recording my new album.' Weiland's imposter was arrested for stealing razors from a Rite-Aid in Beverley Hills, and was also charged with felony possession of a controlled substance when police found methamphetamine on him. Scroll down for video . 'It's a lie': Former Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland posted a video proving that he is not currently in jail for drug possession and burglary . Hurley was stopped by a security guard when he was caught allegedly stealing the razors and other toiletry items, but escaped before being caught by officers, who then also found the drugs. The charge was upped to burglary from . simple theft because Hurley allegedly carried an insulated bag that . wouldn't set off sensors, indicating the act was premeditated. He gave police the name and birth date of his famous lookalike, which resulted in TMZ reporting that Weiland had been in jail for the last four weeks, with the bail set to $95,000. After being found out, police said Hurley could now also face charges of giving false information to officers. Back in day: Weiland was fired from the Stone Temple Pilots last year by his band mates for breach of contract and using the group's name to promote his solo career . Weiland . has faced legal troubles in the past, mostly drug- and alcohol-related, . and has been in-and-out of rehab over the years. But he told Canadian reporter Rudy Blair early last month that he has overcome his 'demons.' 'Past . demons are past demons; that's stuff that I dealt with 14 years ago,' he said. 'I mean, I guess Keith Richards gets asked about [his past drug . use], so why shouldn't I? But it's not something that I think about, . ever. Those days of my dope abuse, and use, are long since by me.' In . 2013, he was fired from Stone Temple Pilots and was sued by his former . band mates for using the group's name to promote his solo career. He filed a $7 million countersuit, alleging his co-founders were not legally authorised to remove him from the band. Record: .

Walters. She will host specials, conduct in-depth investigations and  big name interviews. 'For many years to come Diane will be a driving force at ABC News with her exceptional storytelling genius,' said Goldston  'She is one of the giants of modern journalism.

"By . David Mccormack . Katie Couric’s big money move from Today to CBS News and the subsequent criticism she received over flagging ratings left the under fire star comparing herself to Hillary Clinton, a new book has revealed. During her 15 years on the Today show, Couric was dubbed ‘America's Sweetheart' but that was before she jumped ship to join CBS Evening News in 2006 and became the highest paid journalist in the world earning $15 million a year. The move quickly turned sour and Couric was left facing a mountain of growing criticism which she wasn’t used to, according to a new book – The News Sorority: Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Christiane Amanpour - And The (Ongoing, Imperfect, Complicated) Triumph of Women In TV. During her 15 years on the Today show, Katie Couric was dubbed 'America's Sweetheart' but that was before she jumped ship to join CBS Evening News in 2006 and became the highest paid journalist in the world . ‘In private, Katie - who had recently turned 50 - was now beginning to actively and repeatedly compare herself to the embattled but energized Hillary Clinton,’ writes author Shelia Weller. ‘Katie deeply related to Hillary; she felt she was being pummeled as the first female anchor just like Clinton was being pummeled as the first major female presidential candidate.’ Behind the scenes, Couric’s massive salary and supposed superstar attitude, mean’t she wasn’t popular with other members of the team. ‘The resentment was virtually immediate,’ a CBS correspondent told Weller. 'Katie deeply related to Hillary,' writes author Shelia Weller in her new book about the high profile TV journalist . ‘The burden was on her,’ Weller wrote. ‘People were waiting to see her disprove the reputation she arrived with. You’ve gotta be conscious of the fact that you’re making at least ten or fifteen or twenty times more than anybody on the show.’ Several of Couric’s colleagues at CBS were less than impressed when they were asked to take pay cuts in the wake of her massive deal. Morley Safer was supposed to earn 30% less, Lesley Stahl was asked to take $500,000 less in salary and Ed Bradley – who died soon after from leukemia - was also supposed to take a cut, according to an extract from the book first published by the New York Daily News. Couric was described as unfriendly and abrasive by ex-CBS staffers interviewed for the book. ‘Katie can put on a charm offensive if she wants to,’ the book says. ‘But really, she doesn’t give a s*** about you only as much as it affected her.’ Video Source CBS . Katie Couric was described as unfriendly and abrasive by ex-CBS News staffers, while the show failed in the ratings war too . Instead of taking on the ‘real work’ associated with being a managing editor, the book says, ‘Katie was out doing other things.’ ‘She was being a star,’ Weller wrote. In 2011, Couric returned to ABC News as a special correspondent and in 2012 she signed a record $40 million contract to host the ill-fated daytime talk show Katie. The show was cancelled after two seasons due to poor ratings and a reported disdain of her core female audience. The last ever episode was filmed last week. In November 2013, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer hired Couric, 57, as Global Anchor of Yahoo News. Couric, who is getting married this summer, debuted in her latest role in January, but has faced growing criticism over her failure to land big-name interviews. She launched with an interview with former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Ex-colleagues of Diane Sawyer, left, spoke about how she made life miserable for overnight staffers at ABC News in the new book The News Sorority, right, which is out in September . The News Sorority focuses on three of the biggest female names in television journalism – Couric, Diane Sawyer and Christiane Amanpour – who Weller writes 'have infiltrated the once impenetrable ""boys club"" and become cultural icons.' The bestselling author has carried out exclusive interviews with many former colleagues. Ex-colleagues of Diane Sawyer have spoken about how she made life miserable for overnight staffers at ABC News, frequently calling them at 1 a.m. and demanding different stories get covered. Despite concerns that the segments would never run, staff were forced to comply with her demands or else. 'If you didn’t do it, and she found out you didn’t do it, she would triple your agony for the next few weeks by calling in at one a.m. more often, wanting more stories, checking back to make sure you were working on them,' writes Weller.","A new book has reveal that Katie Couric's big money move to CBS News in 2006 was unpopular behind the cameras as well as with TV audiences .

According to The Atlanta Business Chronicle, the sign was replaced Wednesday night, but not before it became the subject of plenty of mockery.

Even worse, the sign ended up on the Downtown Connector, which is the city's most traveled road.

Georgia Aquarium officials have not commented on the sign's error . The misspelled sign has been in place just under a week.

'The passenger was shaken up (who wouldn’t be?) but not injured,' Massachusetts State Police wrote on their Facebook page. Terrifying: A hatchet hurtled off the back of a landscaper's dump truck and sliced into the windshield of a car traveling behind it on the Interstate 95 in Topsfield, Massachusetts on Wednesday . A photo shared by police online shows that the axe's head landed on the car's dashboard next to the air conditioning vent - not far from where the unidentified passenger sat. Newbury Barracks Trooper Joseph Risteen who attended the scene fined the truck driver, from Peabody, $200 for failing to secure cargo.

"By . Adam Duggan . and Australian Associated Press . The day Essendon have been dreading has arrived - with players at the AFL club receiving official word they will be facing anti-doping charges. It's the latest development in a saga that first came to light last February, when the club announced they would come under a joint AFL and ASADA investigation over their 2012 supplements program. Meanwhile, NRL club the Cronulla Sharks are also in the firing line, with Fairfax Media reporting up to 17 players from their 2011 squad will also be issued show cause notices by the anti-doping body. If proved, the anti-doping charges may well spell the end of some players' careers. Scroll down for video . On notice: ASADA have officially announced that players at the Essendon Football Club will face charges, as a result of the anti-doping agency's joint investigation with the AFL into the club's 2012 supplements scandal . Former Essendon Bombers great Tim Watson, father of current captain Jobe, said players were in 'real shock' after ASADA issued show cause notices. 'It's been a real possibility for some time,' Mr Watson told Channel Seven. 'New AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan told the CEOs and presidents only last week they should start preparing themselves for what could be a very bumpy ride.' 'It could go on for two or three years.' Possibly career ending: The suspensions that could be handed down may well spell the end of some Essendon players careers . Show-cause notices require those issued to explain, within 10 days, why they shouldn't be handed an infraction notice for breaching the World Anti-Doping Agency drug code. If the explanation isn't deemed acceptable by ASADA, the anti-doping agency then compiles a report on those they believe have breached the report. The report is then handed to a group of independent experts, who assess the evidence and decide whether an infraction notice will be handed down. If issued with an infraction notice, the player is immediately suspended until the matter is resolved at a Tribunal. Melbourne's The Age newspaper is reporting ASADA is issuing 34 players with show cause notices. But ASADA, the AFL and Essendon are keeping quiet, refusing to confirm any details. 'Essendon are not in a position to comment on any matter relating to its players and the ASADA investigation,' Essendon said in a statement on Thursday night. 'The club will continue to act in the best interest of their players and respect the integrity and confidentiality of this process.' The team were heavily penalised by the AFL last year, kicking them out of the finals and suspending coach James Hird for 12 months. The club brought in a team of investigators to conduct an internal probe into the supplements program. Former Telstra CEO Ziggy Switkowski was among the investigators. He spoke of a 'disturbing picture of a pharmacologically experimental environment never adequately controlled or challenged or documented within the club.' 'It's been hanging over their head since February last year, I think they've done an amazing job to be able to go out there and play every week like they have,' AFL Players Association president Luke Ball told the AFL Footy Show on Thursday. 'I'm glad to hear that hopefully, what's happened today, gives some sort of clarity.' 5 February 2013: Essendon Bombers announce a joint investigation, with the Australia Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) that will look into the club's 2012 supplements program – 10 days out from their season opener.7 February 2013: In what some have labelled the 'blackest day in Australian sport,' the Australian Crime Commission uncovers widespread use of drugs, including some not yet approved for human use, in Australian sport.

"By . Nicky Harley . It's often called the most important meal of the day, vital to set you up for hours of work or play. But, according to new research, British people are struggling to fit breakfast into their increasingly hectic schedules. A survey found the average person takes less than seven minutes to wolf down their morning meal and more than a third skip it altogether. Only half eat breakfast every day, with 40 per cent telling researchers they have rushed the meal - with the average time taken just six minutes and 15 seconds. Scroll down for video . Two-thirds of Brits surveyed eat breakfast on the go - some in the car and on public transport . The poll of 2,000 adults, by oat drink producers Oatly, also revealed 34 per cent of people don't eat anything before noon. Only half eat breakfast every day, with 40 per cent telling researchers they have rushed the meal - with the average time taken just six minutes and 15 seconds. The most common reasons are rushing to work (58 per cent), starting work too early (24 per cent), waking up late (18 per cent), being distracted by the children (16 per cent), the school run (14 per cent) or a long commute (12 per cent). Two-thirds (65 per cent) admit munching breakfast while getting ready, more than a quarter (27 per cent) eat in the car, while 15 per cent admit eating on public transport. Weekends see the nation take the most time over breakfast, with an average of 13 minutes and two seconds spent enjoying the first meal of the day on Saturdays and Sundays. Pharrell Williams' (left) hit Happy is one of the top songs listened to at breakfast followed by the Beatles (right) Those who do make time for breakfast are more than likely to do so while listening to music (86 per cent) to perk them up for the day ahead. 1. Pharrell Williams - Happy . 2. The Beatles - Here Comes the Sun . 3. U2 - A Beautiful Day . 4. The Monkees - Daydream Believer . 5. The Killers - Mr Brightside . Pop is the number one morning mood-lifting musical genre (60 per cent), with Pharrell Williams' chart-topper Happy (25 per cent) named the ultimate track to accompany breakfast. However, nearly half (45 per cent) say they don't even have time to put the radio on in the morning. Neuroscientist Doctor Jack Lewis, co-author of Sort Your Brain Out, said of the findings: 'Music is one of the very best tools available to every one of us, enabling us to shift our brains into a different gear. 'Its mood-altering impacts are extremely well supported by decades' worth of scientific research. Using music to get us into the habit of making a little extra time each morning to give our brains the right fuel to kick start our day can only be a good thing.' 1. Pop . 2. Rock . 3. Indie . 4. Classical . 5. Hip Hop . He added: 'A nutritious breakfast is also brilliant for brain-hacking, which refers to simple adjustments to our behaviour that get our brains working better.' Toni Petersson, chief executive of Oatly, added: 'A healthy breakfast makes starting the day a lot easier, so it's a shame to see so many are rushing it, or even skipping it altogether. 'It seems many are trying to eat as quickly as possible in the mornings, so the joy of sitting down to our most important meal is being forgotten.","Only half of Brits eat breakfast everyday, with 40 per cent rushing meals finishing it in under seven minutes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 450lbs white rapper from Antioch, Tennessee, is regretting borrowing his favorite restaurant’s logo for the cover of latest mixtape after Waffle House sent him a cease and desist letter for infringing their copyright. Jason DeFord aka Jelly Roll jokingly describes himself as ‘a regular fat piece of white trash’ and claims to have visited the food chain hundreds of times. Earlier this year, he recorded a 21-track mixtape which he called ‘Whiskey, Weed & Waffle House’, in tribute to three of his favorite things. Waffle House blues: Rapper Jelly Roll has been a loyal customer for years but that didn't stop the company suing him for copyright infringement . He printed up 10,000 copies to give away, with a front cover featuring a bottle of Crown Royal whiskey, a pot leaf and Waffle House’s distinct logo. The back-cover design even looked like the chain’s menu. Unfortunately Waffle House didn’t appreciate the homage and within a month 28-year-old Jelly Roll had received a cease and desist letter from their lawyers. The heavyweight rapper was ordered to destroy everything featuring the company’s name and logo within 10 days for infringing their corporate trademark. Lawyers for the food chain were quick to hit aspiring rapper Jelly Roll with a series of charges after he used their logo on his mixtape cover as a tribute to his favorite eatery . The company also filed a trademark claim that shut him out of his Facebook and YouTube accounts for more than a week. Initially flattered by all the attention from his favorite eatery, it took a visit to a lawyer for Jelly Roll to realize the severity of the situation. The thoughtless homage has left him picking up a very expensive check and he estimates that he’s lost more than $10,000 so far, including scrapping a video shot at a Nashville Waffle House and $500 every time his lawyer communicates with the chain. Yet despite being on the receiving end the company’s strong-arm tactics Jelly Roll confesses that he hasn't been able to stop eating at his local Waffle House. Jelly Roll called his mixtape 'Whiskey, Weed & Waffle House' in tribute to three of his favorite things . ‘I swore I wouldn't tell too many people - I promise you're the only reporter I’ll tell - I just ate at a Waffle House! Even after I vowed I'd never eat at one again, I found myself hungry at an odd hour, under the intoxication of a little whiskey and a little weed, and I wound up in a Waffle House,’ he confessed to Gawker. The incident has brought Jelly Roll a lot of undue stress, but he has gotten through tougher situation in his 28 years including going to prison for drugs possession. The father-of-one has even made able to make light of the situation. ‘I'm 450 pounds - I should have sued Waffle House 10 years ago! Do you know how many All-Star Breakfasts I bought in my life? I might’ve stopped at 330!’ he joked. Weighing in at 450 pounds, Rapper .

"By . Becky Evans . Comedian Joan Rivers was quizzed by a squad of balaclava-clad UK Border Agency officials - after being mistaken for an illegal immigrant. Four guards swooped as the American star enjoyed a weekend fishing trip while filming her latest reality show. The Border Agency officials had been alerted about a suspicious group of people on two fishing trawlers on the Swale Estuary in Kent - a well-known spot for attempts at illegal immigration. Mistaken identity: Joan Rivers, pictured with her film crew on a fishing boat, was recording an episode for her US reality television show during a visit to Lees Court Estate in Kent to see her friend the Countess Sondes . Sense of humour: Despite the mix-up Rivers, pictured with her daughter Melissa and members of her team, saw the funny side and was 'hilarious' throughout . Despite the mix-up, Rivers managed to hang on to her notorious sense of humour. She said: 'Even though we were innocent I am so sorry they didn't arrest us. I love Englishmen and they were very cute.' The 79-year-old was visiting her friend, and fellow New Yorker, the Countess Sones at the 6,900 acre Lees Court Estate in Faversham, Kent, which she owns. Border Agency officers, dressed in black, quizzed Sondes, Rivers and her daughter Melissa who were filming Joan and Melissa, Joan Knows Best! for US television. After the discussion the Border Agency allowed Rivers to go back to work. Lady Sondes said: 'Given the Lees Court . Estate's close involvement with the Swale, it was a great comfort to . know that the Border Agency acted in a pro-active, efficient and . friendly manner.' A spokeswoman for the estate added: 'It was all very dramatic. Joan was hilarious throughout the whole time she was with us. 'The Border Agency did not have the same sense of humour - they understandably took the situation very seriously. 'They were all dressed in black and were wearing balaclavas but you could still see their face - they were very efficient not the sort of people you would want to mess with. 'But they were very professional and did a fantastic job - it's great to know people like that are protecting our shores.' Hilarious: Rivers, pictured left with daughter Melissa, were filming for their US show, pictured right with her film crew, when they were stopped. The comedian wished she had been arrested because she 'loves Englishmen' The UK Border Agency yesterday confirmed the incident on October 20, but denied they were acting on a tip off. A spokeswoman said officers spotted the vessel while on routine patrol. She said: 'Our officers will investigate any potential immigration or customs offences and take swift and robust action to ensure our borders remain secure. 'On October 20, 2012, whilst on routine patrol, Her Majesty's Cutter Vigilant approached a fishing vessel in the Swale Estuary, Kent. 'Border Force officers spoke with the captain of the vessel to establish ownership and number of passengers. 'After a short discussion, Border Force officers were satisfied the passengers and crew did not present a risk to the border. 'The search of any vessel in UK territorial seas and internal waters plays an important role in protecting the border. 'Presently there is no means of establishing, with any certainty, where a vessel has come from until Border Force officers have spoken to the captain, crew and in some cases boarded the vessel. 'In the vast majority of instances, officers will take no more than a few minutes to satisfy themselves as to whether a vessel presents a risk to the border.'

"By . Arthur Martin . Asif Hussainkhil, 33, from Kabul, pictured with his makeshift tent in Calais, France, where he was returned by coastguards after trying to sail a homemade raft across the Channel to England . Coastguards told him he could have drowned and his friends think he is crazy. But even though his attempt to cross the Channel on a flimsy raft ended in disaster, Afghan migrant Asif Hussainkhil is determined to try again. After recovering from hypothermia brought on by his failed bid to reach Britain, he told the Mail: ‘I will keep trying because it is my destiny to get  to England.’ The 33-year-old tried to cross the Channel on Monday with a raft made of six nailed-together bits of plank, with a bedsheet as a sail. His craft had no rudder to steer it, and was only kept afloat by a piece of polystyrene covered with a tarpaulin. Mr Hussainkhil also had no compass to guide him. French coastguards said he was being blown wildly off course towards the rougher seas of the Atlantic Ocean when he was picked up. Now, despite the obvious  pitfalls of his plan, Mr Hussainkhil has already started  collecting the materials he needs to build a similar raft. ‘The police have destroyed my boat so I am going to build another one,’ he said. ‘But I would have made it to England on Monday if the coastguards did not pick me up. I am very cross with them. ‘During my journey, I was singing to myself as I was sailing because I was so happy. I am certain I was going the right way.’ His four-hour attempt to cross the world’s busiest shipping lane took him into the path of a P&O passenger ferry. He said: ‘Some people thought I got too close to the ferry, but I knew what I was doing. I got out of the way in time. 'In fact, as I sailed past I waved at the passengers and said “Hi”. I told them I had a better boat than they did.’ Mr Hussainkhil told the Mail he left his home village of  Mussahi, 15 miles south  of Afghan’s capital Kabul, aged 19 because the Taliban were putting pressure on him to  join them. If you got points for effort... French coast guard rescue Asif Hussein Khail who tried to cross the Channel on a makeshift raft using a bedsheet as a sail . Afghan migrant Asif Hussainkhil with his makeshift tent in Calais, France, where he was returned by coastguards after his latest attempt to cross the Channel. He has vowed to build a new boat. Since then he has travelled through nine countries, including Iran, Serbia and Switzerland, before moving to France to try and get to Britain. He is now living in a tent in Calais. He said: ‘I’ve lived and worked in lots of places but many of the people in those countries were racist towards me. So I wanted to keep moving on. ‘I’ve heard good things about the treatment of people in  England. It is my dream to get there and I will keep trying. Mr Hussainkhil’s failed boat trip is his third attempt to reach Britain. On the two previous occasions he tried to swim across the 21-mile Channel with a pair of wooden fins attached to his feet. He was picked up by coastguards after three hours on his first attempt and after one hour on the second try. ‘I want to work really hard in England and show the people there how I can be of service to their society.’ He added: ‘This time I’m going to build a special boat which will go faster than the last one so that I won’t get caught. It’s not dangerous on the sea. I know I can get there. It’s my dream.’ French Coastguard chief Bernard Barron said the Afghan's solo sail was undoubtedly nothing to do with the gangs of people smugglers currently . operating in Calais.’ ‘They . do not encourage migrants to travel alone, and certainly not in the . sea,’ he said. France is to bulldoze camps containing hundreds of illegal migrants hoping to travel to Britain from Calais because of a growing danger to public health, it emerged today . Local prefect Denis Robin also said there were particular 'fears for public health', especially as the makeshift camps do not have basic supplies like water . Last month four would-be immigrants to Britain were taken to hospital suffering from severe hypothermia after being caught in the sea off Calais. In a further sign of the desperate methods being used by the migrants, all were trying to get aboard England-bound ferries moored in the harbour. It follows four other migrants dying in a single week in Calais as they risked life and limb for the chance to claim residency in the UK. Clutching waterproof bundles full of food and other essentials, the men swam out from Fort Risban, part of the city’s ancient fortifications. ‘The idea was to swim out to the ferries so as to avoid customs and other checks,’ said a local police spokesman. ‘Fisherman spotted them, and alerted the authorities. Port patrol cars were on the quay alongside them within a few minutes.’ Police in the French port said that many of the settlements would be 'cleared by the end of next week,' to stop them getting bigger . The migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police as they try their luck at getting to Britain . Three of the men were plucked out of the water relatively easily, but one went missing and got into difficulty into deep water. The body of an Eritrean who also tried to swim across the harbour drowned in exactly the same spot last October. Hundreds of migrants from outside the EU are living in a camp yards from the perimeter fence of Calais port. Charities . say there are more than 650 in the town, the greatest number since the . closure of the Red Cross camp at Sangatte in 2002 – and they are taking . advantage of gaps in security and a minimal police presence. There are currently up to 1000 migrants living rough in Calais, with up to 650 around the port area alone . On March 9 an Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port. The body of a 25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in Calais’s  Batellerie dock on March 14 and the next day a fellow Ethiopian in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a  vehicle transporter. It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Residents in the Japanese province of Fukushima have decided to tell the world that they are alive and well and living perfectly normal lives despite the recent nuclear disaster by recording a music video with Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy as the soundtrack. Hitomi Kumasaka, a 53-year-old consulting firm manager in Fukushima, came up with the idea of creating a Fukushima version of the song after learning on the internet of a widespread misunderstanding that people can no longer live in the region due to the nuclear accident caused by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. About 200 people, including Fukushima Mayor Kaoru Kobayashi, small children, Buddhist monks, and people from all walks of life in the area appear in the video and dance in their own styles. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Smiles better: The people of Fukushima have made a YouTube video in which they dance to Pharrell Williams' Happy to prove life in the area is carrying on as normal despite 2011's nuclear disaster . You've got to hand it to them: The video features some wacky characters . Enthusiasm: A huge number of people took part in the upbeat YouTube video . Participants were given a free rein to dance to the song in their own way, and the video they produced as a result was filmed at various locations including the Fukushima Train Station, local tourism attractions such as the hot springs, a rice paddy and vineyards, and a shopping mall.

She said: ‘With this video, I want you to know that we are also happy and healthy just like you. Please enjoy our dance and share our happiness. And many thanks to Pharrell for this great song.’ Williams's song, which repeats the phrase ‘because I'm happy’ with a light rhythm, was released late last year.

Since then, using it as the accompaniment to YouTube videos has become a global phenomenon. There were also well over 1,000 comments on the Fukushima version with many people declaring that it was the best use of the hit song yet. One user wrote: ‘[The video] cheered me up’ and another added ‘is it really filmed in Fukushima?’ JR Fukushima Station Master Yasunori Kano, who appeared in the video, said: ‘I hope that the video shows how attractive Fukushima is.’ Volunteers in Ishinoamki, Miyagi Prefecture, and in Rikuzen-Tataka, Iwate Prefecture, are also working on their own ‘Happy’ videos, which are expected to be released from early July. More than three years after the March 2011 meltdowns, the Fukushima plant is still plagued by a massive amount of contaminated water. Repeated water leaks from storage tanks and other mishaps have hampered a decommissioning effort that is expected to take decades.

"By . Lydia Warren . Arrest: Will Hayden, from Sons of Guns, was arrested on Saturday but posted bond . The star of reality TV show Sons of Guns has been arrested for child molestation - but he insists the claims are the work of a bitter ex-girlfriend. William Hayden, 49, whose show airs on the Discovery Channel, was arrested in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Saturday on charges of molestation of a child and a crime against nature. The gun store owner posted $150,000 bond the same day and was released, according to the sheriff's website. While the case has been sealed by a judge, Hayden told TMZ that his ex-girlfriend, who is mother to one of his daughters, went to authorities a week ago and accused him of molesting the girl. He said that she did it as revenge for him ending their relationship. Hayden has since married and is bringing up the girl with his new wife. The youngster returned to his home after he was interviewed by Child Protective Services. His older daughter Stephanie, who appears on Sons of Guns beside him, said that her father was innocent. 'There was never any impropriety in our home,' she said. 'He was and is a good father.' On the show: Hayden (second left) is the star of Sons of Guns, which first aired on Discovery in 2011. It follows Hayden's company, which manufactures and sells custom guns in Louisiana . On Monday, she took to Facebook to defend her father. 'This . was a false allegation and unfortunately that's all it takes,' she . wrote. 'My father is a good man, and ALL of his children love him very . much and are truly sickened that a person would try to do this to our . family. Its not right [sic]. You see the love we have for our family... 'The . one thing that really hurts us is that my sister is heartbroken that . anyone could think this of her father. Its a nightmare...please stand . with us.' Sons of . Guns first aired on the Discovery Channel in 2011 and follows Hayden's . life at the helm of a gun store, Red Jacket Firearms, in Louisiana. Stephanie manages the office for the company. It's . not his first brush with the law; in 2009, Hayden - a former Marine - . was investigated over ten unregistered guns by the U.S. Department of . Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Video Source Discovery . Support: Hayden's daughter Stephanie, who also appears on the show, said her dad (right) was a good father . Defense: Stephanie took to Facebook on Monday afternoon to defend her father and said that her younger sister was 'heartbroken' by the claims made against their father . Then in . 2013, relatives filed a lawsuit against him, claiming he and his ex-wife . had previously given them shares in the company - before transferring . part of the company to a new name and rendering the shares worthless, Business Report reported. But his attorney argued that he had transferred some of the business to comply with the ATF and federal regulations regarding automatic firearms and had never intended to deceive anyone. East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's office refused to comment on this latest case, saying it had been sealed by a judge.","Will Hayden, 49, was arrested in Louisiana on Saturday and posted bond .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . With their friendly faces and playful natures, it may seem that wild dolphins are always friendly. But a bottlenose dolphin has been reported to have deliberately pushed a man underwater while he was swimming in the sea off County Cork, in the Republic of Ireland. The animal is said to have ‘lashed out’ at the swimmer twice with its tail, prompting experts to warn swimmers to keep out of the water near the large predators. Smiling assassin? A bottlenose dolphin is said to have deliberately pushed a man under water who was swimming in the sea in County Cork, Ireland. A local group said: 'Do not confuse the shape of their jawline with a smile. They can cause serious injury to humans and have killed in the past.' A stock image is pictured . The incident occurred on July 26 off Sherkin Ireland, according to a report made to the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group (IWDG) which stated that the animal acted ‘aggressively’. Known as Clet, the adult bottlenose dolphin is thought to have come to the area from France, after spending time off the coasts of South Devon, Cornwall and Wales. The IWDG said that Clet is a non-social solitary dolphin who does not seek out and engage with swimmers. The group’s log book reads: ‘We are aware of a report of an adult swimmer nearby in wetsuit and mask, from a yacht at anchor, being aggressively pushed underwater by the dolphin. They got a bit of a shock as a result.’ The IWDG has now warned swimmers to exercise ‘extreme caution’ when attempting to interact with the powerful creatures and to respect the space of ‘this very large, apex predator’. ‘IWDG's advice is not to get into the water with it, and to enjoy the animal from the safety of the shore or from one of the local whale watch boats or licenced ferries.’ ‘Bottlenose dolphins are not cute and cuddly, they are not our ""friends"" and nor do they benefit in any meaningful or long term way from interacting with humans.’ Clet has been observed swimming close to boats in the area, but experts claim that he is solitary and does not enjoy contact with humans. The incident happened on July 26 off Sherkin Ireland (pictured on the map), according to a report made to the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, which stated that the animal acted 'aggressively' The group told swimmers: ‘Do not confuse the shape of their jawline with a smile. They can and do cause serious injury to humans and have killed in the past.’ It is not known exactly why dolphins attack humans or large animals like porpoises as, unlike sharks, they do not eat their victim. An expert from the IWDG told BBC News that it is impossible to known if the dolphin was deliberately attacking the man, or if it was trying to play with him. Dolphins often engage in rough play, holding each other down and giving chase, so it is possible that the dolphin was playing, but some dolphin experts claim that the creatures sometimes attack humans when they are feeling amorous. Bottlenose dolphins can display violent mating practices where they act in groups to chase and mate with a female of their own species over weeks, whether she is interested or not. Male dolphins are also known to fight and kill rivals and offspring, suggesting they could also turn on humans mistakenly. Trevor Spradlin, a U.S. Federal dolphin expert told The New York Times that dozens of bites to humans have been reported and people have been pulled under the water by bottlenose dolphins, which can measure 12ft (3.7 metres) long and have sharp teeth to tear fish and squid. A dramatic rise in killer attacks by dolphins on porpoises is baffling scientists in one of Britain's main breeding seas. The calm waters of Cardigan Bay in Wales turned red in July as bottlenose dolphins killed smaller porpoises. Marine . scientists are struggling to understand why the attacks have been on . the rise - with three out of the four attacks proving fatal. Researchers . at the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre (CBMWC) said they have . always known dolphins attack porpoises, but that the frequency of recent . attacks is alarming. Experts . have reported stranded porpoises, and floating bodies with punctured . lungs and other internal injuries, inflicted by dolphins. People have witnessed bottlenose dolphins repeatedly forcing porpoises under water, bashing them and throwing them in the air. Cardigan . Bay is home to Europe's largest resident population of dolphins - who . share the sheltered waters with smaller harbour porpoises. Scientist Sarah Perry said she had been left baffled by the recent spate of deadly attacks. 'One . possibility is that they see the porpoises as competitors for food, . especially if there's a shortage of prey in the area,' she said. 'Although . porpoises normally go for smaller prey, dolphins will eat anything. However there's been no other indication recently of any shortage.' Another theory is that a low number of females is prompting the attacks by males. Male . dolphins have been known to kill young dolphins in order to mate with . the calf's mother. Porpoises are similar in size to a dolphin calf. Clet the dolphin (not pictured) is said to have 'lashed out' at the swimmer twice with its tail, prompting experts to warn swimmers to keep out of the water. Experts say it is impossible to tell if the animal was playing or deliberately attacking someone . He said: ‘A woman who fed a pair of dolphins and then jumped into the water to swim with them was bitten. ''I literally ripped my left leg out of its mouth,'' she said during her one-week stay in the hospital’. Just last summer, two women were taken to hospitals with injuries after they were attacked by a female dolphin known as Dusty, off the coast of County Clare and there have been frequent reports of the animals attacking porpoises in harbours. ‘Such interactions between bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises are invariably aggressive and routinely result in the death of the porpoise, by blunt traumas from ramming, which can result in serious internal injuries,’ the IWDG said. ‘They [the interactions] are likely to be a common occurrence in all Irish inshore waters, where the ranges of these two coastal species overlap.’ Clet has been spotted ramming a porpoise and the group said it is ‘another good reason why ‘people should not swim with him or any ""solitary"" bottlenose dolphin....they are wild animals that should be respected as such'.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Imitations of Flappy Bird – the free gaming app that took the world by storm – might be popping up everywhere, but the original game is ‘gone forever,’ according to its creator. Nguyen Ha Dong, the developer who pulled his highly successful and profitable app over the weekend, revealed he did so because he thinks it was too addictive. The Vietnamese Hanoi-based developer is believed to have walked away from a small fortune as it is estimated he could have made $50,000 every day in in-app advertising alone. Scroll down for video . It's coming back! Flappy Bird, a simple game that became a surprise hit, was the most popular mobile game on the App Store before it was pulled unexpectedly by its developer in February, but Dong has now announced that it will return - but not necessarily soon . Flappy Bird caused a sensation after rising out of obscurity to become one of the most downloaded mobile games on both Apple and Google's online stores. Users have to steer a bird between green pipes. The Android version has been downloaded up to 50 million times, and attracted more than half a million reviews. It also topped the Apple download charts, although figures have not been released for the iOS version. He told Forbes that he created the app - which saw players tapping on their smartphone screen to navigate a pixelated birds though narrow pipes - to be played in a few minutes, in his first interview since he took his game away. ‘It happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem,’ he said. ‘To solve that problem, it’s best to take down Flappy Bird. It’s gone forever.’ Flappy Bird was the most popular free mobile game on Apple App Store and Google's Android Play store. The exclusive interview took place in a secret location in Vietnam, perhaps because Dong has received death threats for pulling the app. Nguyen Ha Dong, (pictured) the creator of the game, pulled his creation from online stores because he said it was too addictive, he told Forbes. He has previously said that the runaway success had ruined his 'simple life' The 29-year old has been thrust into the spotlight since the app became incredibly popular - and now obsolete - and has even been summoned by the country’s deputy Prime Minister. Dong’s parents only learned of his involvement with the hit app last week, despite the fact the game has been growing in popularity since it was released on May 24, 2013. He coded it in just a couple of days but claims he pulled it for altruistic reasons – rather than a threat from Nintendo about the similarity of the app’s pipes to those in the legendary Super Mario games. Dong currently has two other apps in the top 20 gaming slots of Apple’s App Store but says that he has no plans to remove them as they are ‘harmless.’ Removal: Dong made the sudden announcement to pull the game on Twtter in February but he didn't explain in any detail why he decided to take down his popular game . He told Forbes that his decision to remove the app was difficult but that his life was not as good as it was before the incredible success of the game. ‘I don’t think it’s a mistake - I have thought it through,’ he said. This is despite Dong receiving a barrage of death threats on Twitter. It appears that fans of the game are willing to go to extremes to keep on playing and phones preloaded with the hit have been listed for as much as $20,000 on eBay. Addictive: Dong said he created the game in just a couple of days. Players had to guide birds between green tubes, reminiscent of those seen in Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. games . Dong announced the grounding of the addictive game in a Tweet at 1900 GMT on Saturday in which he also apologised to Flappy Bird players. '22 hours from now, I will take ""Flappy Bird"" down,' Dong said adding: 'It is not anything related to legal issues.' 'I cannot take this anymore,' he wrote. The move led to a barrage of abuse, including one tweeter who messaged: ‘YOU BEST NOT BE DELETING FLAPPY BIRD BECAUSE I WILL MURDER YOU IF U DO,’ while another told Dong ‘I’ll find you and I’ll kill you.’ The end: Rumours were rife that Dong removed the game because of a legal threat from Nintendo as well as he had a plan to sell it to  a game development company. However, the app developer claims he did so for altruistic reasons . Fans of the game were shelling out thousands for phones preloaded with the game. Shortly after Dong announced the game was being pulled from the stores back in February devices were being listed for up to $20,000 (£13,000) on eBay, pictured .","Nguyen Ha Dong, a Vietnamese game developer, announced on Twitter Saturday that he would take down his game Flappy Birds .

"By . Alex Finnis . Bloody Marys and fried food are known as two of the best hangover cures. But a bar in Milwaukee has taken the idea to the next level - by creating a whopping Bloody Mary topped off with a whole fried chicken. Sobelman's Pub and Grill now boasts the 'Chicken Fried Bloody Beast' on its menu - and it really is an absolute monster. Sobelman's Pub and Grill has created the 'Chicken Fried Bloody Beast' - an 80 ounce Bloody Mary topped off with an entire fried chicken . The 'drink' is made to feed four people, and also includes two 'Baconadoes' (skewers of bacon-wrapped jalapeño cheeseballs) as well as other garnishes . The drink-cum-supersize-meal is served in a jug and features four regular sized Bloody Marys, as well as cheese, sausage, pickles, olives, onion, mushrooms, asparagus, scallion, shrimp, lemon, Brussels sprouts, tomato, celery and two 'Baconadoes' (skewers of bacon-wrapped jalapeño cheeseballs) - not to mention the entire fried bird. The price might look as hard to stomach as the concoction itself - it will set you back a whole $50 - but it is big enough to feed four people, and $5 of every sale goes to Milwaukee’s Hunger Task Force - a food charity which works in the area. The crazy cocktail is the brainchild of Dave 'King of the Bloodies' Sobelman, who already comes with a reputation for making drinks with a delicious twist. The whopping bloody will set you back $50, $5 of which is donated to Milwaukee’s Hunger Task Force - a food charity which works in the area . Sobelman's is famous for its brutally big bloodies - it already serves 'The Bloody Masterpiece' - a Bloody Mary with a bacon cheeseburger on top. It is not the only bar to experiment with food-filled cocktails though - Vancouver bar the Score on Davie sells a Caesar, the Canadian take on a Bloody Mary, that not only features a whole roast chicken, but also a burger, pulled pork Sriracha-glazed slider, onion rings, chicken wings, a pulled pork mac and cheese hotdog and even a brownie. Their effort is a monstrous 5,000 calories, costs $60 and takes 20 minutes to put together.","Sobelman's Pub and Grill create the 'Chicken Fried Bloody Beast'

Speaking about the exciting plans, organiser Remi Ray said: 'The idea behind the London Plus Size Fashion weekend came to me a few years ago. 'I had always felt uncomfortable trying to fit into mainstream fashion when my shape didn’t conform to what is perceived to be mainstream sizes. 'After completing my fashion degree I decided to look further into supporting the plus size market and started Trapped in a skinny World, which is a plus-size vintage fashion boutique.' However, Remi, who studied at London College of Fashion, wanted to go further and put a spotlight on the plus size market by hosting the London Plus Size Fashion weekend show around the same time as the world famous London Fashion Week when fashion's focus will be on the capital. Remi added: 'We are working night and . day to make sure the first ever London plus size fashion weekend event . will be a huge success and the first of many.

They ran against Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2012 - and lost - but yesterday Congressman Paul Ryan said he would love to see Mitt Romney have another run at the White House saying the 'third time's the charm'. Former Massachusetts Governor Romney who failed to win the nomination in 2008 and then lost the election to President Barack Obama four years later interviewed Mr Ryan at the Union League Club of Chicago about his new book The Way Forward: Renewing the American Idea - the first time the pair have been seen at a public event since the failed presidential bid two years ago. Governor Romney returned the compliment claiming that Congressman Ryan 'wouldn't be a bad president' himself. Scroll down for video . Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney (right) and his 2012 vice presidential running mate Paul Ryan arrive at the Union League Club in Chicago where Mr Romney interviewed Mr Ryan about his new book . Congressman Ryan has said that he will wait until after the midterm elections to decide whether to pursue his own presidential campaign in 2016. The Republicans need six seats to take control of the Senate, which would in turn give them Congress thus making life difficult for President Obama in his last two years in office. Yesterday's men or tomorrow's presidential running mates? Congressman Ryan expounds his philosophy while former Massachusetts Governor Romney listens . Working the room: Mitt Romney interviews his 2012 presidential running mate Paul Ryan (left on dais) Governor Romney has been campaigning for GOP candidates across the country, most recently for Congressman Tom Cotton this week in Arkansas, and Congressman Ryan has been promoting his book. Romney himself reviewed Ryan's manuscript and offered notes. And Congressman Ryan even sought advice from former Romney speech writers and advisers during the writing. During their interview, both men criticised the president's record on domestic issues, including the economy, health care and immigration, with Congressman Ryan warning that President Obama will 'poison the well' on immigration compromise if he takes any unilateral action. Governor Romney said that the president sent a message to Russia when he did not act in Syria and that there has been 'an explosion of very bad things in the world' since then. They also blamed President Obama and the Democratic-led Senate for not working with Republicans on important issues. Glad handing: 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney (left) shakes the hand of a member of the audience after interviewing his former vice-presidential running mate Paul Ryan (centre) in Chicago . 'If people want to actually see action in this country and dealing with problems from education to health care, immigration to our fiscal needs ... they're going to have to vote for Republican senators and ... a Republican president, as well,' Governor Romney said. Congressman Ryan told reporters after the question-and-answer session with his former running mate that he would 'love to see Mitt Romney run for president again'. The Q&A session stayed on political issues and did not touch on the section where Mr Ryan recounts how at the age of 15, he discovered his 55-year-old alcoholic father dying in bed from an apparent heart attack. Mr Ryan has said event shaped him as a politician and family man, and figures heavily into whether he'll seek the presidency in 2016. Although writing a book often is seen as a prelude to a presidential campaign, Congressman Ryan has said he's not sure that he is ready to spend more time away from Janesville, the small Wisconsin town where he grew up and where he and his wife, Janna, have raised their three children. 'One of the reasons why I've always passed elected leadership positions up in the House - you know, speaker, leader, all the things people ask you to run for - is because it takes you away from your family even more,' Mr Ryan said. 'I've made career decisions based upon family balance and part of that is because of my own upbringing and my own childhood.' Who will run in 2016?

However, staff at one of Britain's oldest pubs believe they have caught a ghost on CCTV - and claim it has smashed a glass on the floor.

This spooky figure was caught on CCTV at Ye Olde Man and Scythe in Bolton, Manchester. It is believed to have smashed a glass on the floor of the premises, which is one of the oldest pubs in Britain . Manager Tony Dooley discovered the spectre after heading downstairs on Friday morning and stumbling upon a broken glass lying on the floor. Thinking he had been burgled, he rushed to check CCTV footage - only to discover the figure flickering mysteriously by the bar. The recording then shut off - for no apparent reason - at 6.18am. 'I came down and saw a glass smashed on the floor so I was instantly suspicious and went to check the CCTV and found it has stopped working,' said Mr Dooley.

'To be honest I was a bit concerned - I’m a bit of a sceptic when it comes to ghosts but you become more of a believer when you see things like that.' The pub, which dates from 1251, is the fourth-oldest pub in Britain and is reportedly haunted by the ghost of James Stanley, the seventh Earl of Derby. Spiritual presence: The pub, which dates from 1251, is reportedly haunted by the ghost of James Stanley (pictured), the seventh Earl of Derby . The royalist, whose family originally owned the inn, is believed to have spent the last hours of his life there before he was beheaded in 1651 toward the end of the Civil War. The chair he sat in before he was executed is still in the pub today - leading some to believe his spirit also remains on the premises. Hundreds of soldiers and civilians were also killed outside the pub during the Bolton Massacre in 1644. With such a bloody history, the premises has long been considered a hotspot for paranormal activity - with a psychics previously finding it to be haunted by at least 25 spirits. Among these are believed to be s woman who hung herself in the cellar several centuries ago, as well as an eight-year-old girl and a phantom dog. 'There have always been rumours it is haunted and we have had psychic readings done here in the past,' said Mr Dooley. 'Occasionally you hear things and wonder if it is just the building settling down or whether it is something else. 'It is the fourth-oldest pub in Great Britain so it’s had its fair share of deaths and whatnot.' Mr Dooley added that he hoped his customers would not be put off by the spirits of olde - saying: 'There is a well-known haunt in Bolton and people are quite receptive of it. 'But you can’t help but get all spooked out when you see something like this. It can make your hairs stand on end.'","Spooky intruder captured on CCTV at Ye Olde Man and Scythe in Bolton .

"By . Simon Jones for MailOnline . Juventus have made an enquiry about the availability of Javier Hernandez after Arsenal stalled on the proposed loan of Lukas Podolski to the Italian giants. Louis van Gaal looks prepared to let the Mexico striker leave Manchester United with Angel di Maria on the verge of completing a £59.7million transfer from Real Madrid and the likes of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie remaining the Dutchman's clear first-choice strikers. And with a top-quality defensive midfielder still desperately needed at Old Trafford, Van Gaal could yet use Juve's interest in Hernandez as bait in a move for Arturo Vidal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Javier Hernandez miss an absolute sitter for Mexico . Kneel-y done: Javier Hernandez (left) looks set to leave Manchester United after four years at the club . Podolski looked set for a move to Turin but Olivier Giroud is now facing up to the prospect of three months out with a broken foot, meaning Arsene Wenger's forward resources have been stretched to their limits. Theo Walcott and Yaya Sanogo are also injured, leaving Alexis Sanchez as the Gunners' only option up front - but the Chile star has struggled in the 'false nine' role in Arsenal's opening few games of the season. Podolski's agent told German publication Die Welt: 'Lukas is fighting his way back into the squad after a tiring World Cup. He feels good here, and has a contract until 2016. But things can happen quickly in football.' Back-up: Lukas Podolski (centre) could now be needed at Arsenal due to Olivier Giroud's injury . Hernandez is set to start Tuesday night's Capital One Cup second round clash at MK Dons along with Danny Welbeck, another United striker whose future is uncertain. Van Gaal looks ready to let the England forward quit the club in search of a more regular starting spot elsewhere.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 04:30 EST, 7 January 2012 . There was an icy, some would say, ghostly welcome on the Welsh hillsides for a tourist on a short break to the Valleys. For when holidaymaker Paul Feehan replayed the video from his holiday he was in for what he believes is the supernatural shock of his life. During a break at his holiday caravan the property developer from Manchester deliberately picked an isolated quiet spot beside a manmade lake to relax and take it easy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Spooky imagining: Paul relaxes on his holiday to Wales while the camera picks up what he believes to be a figure in the background . And as he took full advantage of the peace and quiet to sit and soak in the views of the stunning Welsh countryside near the village of Abersoch on the Lyn Peninsula he was filmed by a friend. Even as the camera rolls there is no hint from either man that they have spotted anyone else near them. Yet when Paul replayed the video he could clearly see a figure standing just a few feet behind him. The figure, which Paul believes could be a ghost, can be seen at the back of the frame standing very still. Lady in red circle: Paul is convinced that the figure captured on the video is wearing Welsh national costume and is female . Behind you! Paul's mystery figure appears more than once in the film shot while he was on holiday in Wales. And it remains there for the duration of the short film as the camera pans left and right across the landscape. Paul even believes that the ghostly spectre is female and is dressed in Welsh national costume. He said: ‘This is really, really, weird. There was nobody else in the area at the time. When we walked down to the lake we saw nobody. ‘I am absolutely positive that the place was deserted at the time and I have no explanation for what you see on the video. It was completely deserted. ‘Knowing the lie of the land I think the figure could have been no more than 15 metres behind me. 'We heard nothing to suspect anybody else was near us. ‘When I saw it on the video I was shocked and did a bit of research on the internet. 'The outline with the hat and the type of dress looks exactly like a woman wearing Welsh folk dress.’","Caravanner adamant only he and friend were present during filming .

"By . Reuters . and Associated Press . A women's college soccer coach has been suspended for a week without pay and most of the team is suspended for one game over a hazing incident. University of New Mexico officials say last Sunday's hazing involved seven freshmen and two were taken to the hospital for excessive alcohol consumption. Athletic director Paul Krebs said he expected coach Kit Vela's suspension to begin immediately, but university policy dictates she has ten days to appeal. Krebs says assistant coaches Jorge Vela and Krista Foo will receive letters of reprimand. Scroll down for video . University of New Mexico vice president of athletics Paul Krebs (left) and women's head soccer coach Kit Vela speak to reporters on Wednesday. She has been suspended following the hazing incident on the team . Twin sisters Danielle and Devin Scelsi quit the team on Monday, withdrew from school and returned to their home in Orange County, California. Friday's season opener against Texas Tech in the Mountain West Conference was canceled, resulting in a $5,000 fine for UNM. 'We are also assessing what our coaches did and didn't know (about the incident),' Krebs told reporters on Wednesday. Kit Vela sat alongside him and appeared visibly distressed. 'As a mother, I am upset and angered over what happened,' she said, adding that the teenager who went to hospital was released on Monday. University officials said heavy drinking was involved but they rejected local media reports that Sunday night's incident involved players being made to strip, or even being sprayed with urine. The OC Weekly reported that Danielle Scelsi called campus police to report her 18-year-old sister Devin was struggling to breathe and appeared to be vomiting after drinking. Officers found two other teens in the apartment with the teen sisters who also seemed drunk. Devin Scelsi was taken to a hospital and another 18-year-old was taken to a separate center. Two days after the incident, the sisters had left the school, the OC Weekly reported. Twins Danielle (pictured right) and Devin Scelsi (left) left the University of New Mexico following a drinking incident during hazing rituals with the soccer team.  Devin reportedly had to be hospitalized last Sunday because she had trouble breathing . The two fraternal twin sisters, pictured with an unknown man, dropped out of the school after they were brutally hazed . Their mother Dawn Scelsi told KTLA her freshman daughters were brutally hazed by older members of the team. She said that they had been playing soccer since the age of four and that was all they wanted to do. They were now focused on their future education, the mom added. Two students have left UNM as a result of the initiations, the team's coach confirmed on Wednesday. The school said the UNM athletics department had let down its players. 'We failed the young women of our soccer program who did not understand the seriousness of hazing,' UNM athletic director Paul Krebs told a news conference in Albuquerque. 'These are good women, but they damaged the reputation of the university, the women's soccer program, and themselves.' Krebs said an ongoing probe has revealed that the majority of the team's players were consuming alcohol at more than one off-campus location, but that none of them were forced to drink. A report by UNM campus police said officers responding to a 911 call took one 18-year-old player to hospital who was extremely intoxicated and had trouble breathing. A soccer match scheduled between UNM and Texas Tech this Friday has been canceled resulting in a $5,000 fine for the New Mexico school.

"By . Francesca Chambers . Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will headline a fundraiser celebrating New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's birthday next month. Romney has let bygones be bygones and reaffirmed his friendship with Christie since the New Jersey politician cozied up to President Barack Obama in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy six days before the general election in 2012. The September 10 birthday bash benefiting the New Jersey GOP is the latest in a string of political events the high-profile Republican politicians have appeared at together this year . Buds again: Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, right, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, left, have reaffirmed their friendship since Romney's defeat in 2012 to Barack Obama. The Republican politicians are pictured here at a town hall meeting in Ohio a few weeks before the presidential election . Once rumored . to be on Romney's short list for vice president, Christie's relationship with the former Massachusetts governor was reportedly on the rocks after he was photographed with the president surveying the damage caused by Sandy less than a week before the presidential election. Christie met Obama on the tarmac when he arrived in New Jersey on Air Force One and took . an aerial tour of the devastated areas in the president's Marine One helicopter. At a press conference afterward Christie said he 'cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and the people of our state.' 'Good . news for all of us is that the president couldn’t have been better . today,' Christie said during his remarks. 'He made it very clear to me today that getting New Jersey . back to normal is his top priority, and it’s my top priority, too. We . had a good day.' Officially, the Romney campaign stood behind Christie, and Romney himself never uttered a harsh word against the New Jersey politician. Romney campaign . manager Matt Rhoades even told the New York Times that Christie did 'exactly . what a governor should do.' But behind the scenes conservatives and Romney aides trashed Christie and blamed him in part for the Republican presidential candidate's defeat at the polls the following week. 'He went out of his way to embrace the president during the final . week of the campaign,' a Romney adviser told National Review Online the day after the election. 'It . wasn’t necessary and it hurt us.' 'Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock, and . Chris Christie undermined the Republican message,' the Romney aide said, . lumping Christie in with two Republican candidates who lost their . Senate races because of their controversial comments on rape. Refusing to be the scapegoat for Romney's drubbing, Christie fired back that people blaming him in the media were 'know-nothing, disgruntled Romney staffers who, you know, don't like the . fact that I said nice things about the president of the United States.' 'I wouldn’t call what I did an embrace of Barack Obama,' Christie told reporters. 'That’s become the wording of it but the fact of the matter is, I’m a guy who tells the truth all the time. If the president of the United States did something good, I was going to say he did something good and give him credit for it. 'It doesn’t take away for a minute the fact that I was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney, that I traveled literally tens of thousands of miles for him, raised tens of millions of dollars for him, and worked harder than any other surrogate in America other than Paul Ryan,' he said, referring to Romney's running mate. Still, Christie continued to be badgered by Republicans in the weeks after the election for his contribution to the GOP's loss. At a Republican Governors Association meeting just after the election, The New York Times said Christie was overheard telling an attendee, 'I will not apologize for doing my job.' Photos of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie meeting President Barack Obama on the tarmac when he came to New Jersey to view the damage caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and Christie's laudatory remarks about Obama's response to the crisis contributed to Romney's loss in the presidential election the next week, conservatives and Romney aides claimed immediately after the election . Whatever ill will Romney may have had for Christie directly after the incident appeared to have dissipated by the time he spoke out about his blistering electoral loss for the first time nearly four months later. 'I'm not going to worry about how Chris was doing what he thought was best for the people of his state,' Romney said on Fox News Sunday. 'I lost my election because of my campaign, not because of what anyone else did.' Romney had verbally forgiven Christie, but the former Massachusetts Governor publicly kept his distance from the potential presidential candidate despite endorsing him for reelection in his Governor's race in 2013. It was not until earlier this year during the Bridgegate scandal that the two men joined forces again, coming together to raise money for the Republican Governors Association, an organization of which Christie is the chair. They've continued to appear at political events together since, including one last month in Utah and the upcoming event in East Brunswick, New Jersey. According to an invitation obtained by Politico, admission to the fundraiser honoring is $150 and entry to the private reception with Romney is $5,000. Guests also have the option of giving the legal maximum in contributions to the New Jersey Republican State Committee - $25,000- to attend a roundtable with Romney. Instead of gifts, the political party asks that attendees bring an 'unwrapped children's toy' to be donated to Toys for Tots. Christie enthusiasts who can't afford to attend the fundraiser can show their support for the second-term Governor by paying $15 to have their name listed in the committee's birthday card to him.","Romney aides and conservatives claimed after the 2012 presidential election that Chris Christie was at fault for Romney's loss to Obama .

"By . Steve Robson . and Will Stewart . Russian scientists claim to have spotted the ‘jaws and skeleton’ of a mystery creature which could be 'the Siberian Loch Ness monster’. Divers braved temperatures of minus 42C to investigate long-held beliefs that a monster lives at the bottom of the remote Lake Labynkyr 4,500 miles east of Moscow in the Siberian wilderness. And the geologists told local media their underwater scanner found the remains of a jaws and skeleton which could be the rumoured beast nicknamed 'the Devil'. Could this be Nesski? This picture is said to show the mystery beast of the lake popping its head above water . 'There have been all sort of hypothesises about what kind of creature it could be: a giant pike, a relic reptile or an amphibia. We didn't manage to prove or to disprove these versions..... we managed to find remains of jaws and skeleton of some animal,' Viktor Tverdokhlebov told the Siberian Times. Tales of a monster measuring up to 33 feet in length predate the accounts of Nessie in Scotland, say Russian academics. Last year a picture emerged which appeared to show 'Nesski' poking her head out of the water. Top diver Dmitry Shiller led a Russian Geographical Society mission to one of the world’s most mysterious lakes which is an average 170ft in depth but has an underwater crevice reaching down to 262ft. Mystery: Lake Labynkyr in the Siberian wilderness has baffled scientists for years as it does not freeze over in the winter . Siberia . The lake puzzles scientists because unlike millions of others in Siberia it does not freeze solid in winter but maintains a temperature of at least plus 2C on the surface. More than 3,000 ft above sea level, it is in the same district as Oymyakon, the coldest inhabited village on earth. Native Evenk and Yakut people have long claimed a ‘Nesski’ lurks in its depths. Known as ‘the Devil’, testimony dating back to the 19th century says the monster has enormous jaws. Images have also recently emerged from a 2006 scientific trip to the lake when strange objects - one of 21ft 4in (6.5 metres) in length - were recorded on a Hummingbird Piranha MAX 215 Portable fish-finder at a depth of 138 to 197 feet. Evidence: Scientists found a strange large object using their echo device in 2006, left, and made an artist's impression, right, of how they believe the creature might look . 'It was our fourth or fifth day at the lake when our echo sounding device registered a huge object in the water under our boat,' said  Associate Professor Lyudmila Emeliyanova, of Moscow State University, of her own close encounter a decade ago. It was clearly alive and too large to be one of the dozen or so known fish species in the lake. 'The object was very dense, of homogeneous structure, surely not a fish nor a shoal of fish, and it was above the bottom,' she said. 'I was very surprised but not scared nor shocked, after all we did not see this animal, we only registered a strange object in the water. But I can clearly say - at the moment, as a scientist, I cannot offer you any explanation of what this object might be.'","Divers say underwater scanner picked up jaws and skeleton of beast .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Following almost a year of rumours, Apple is said to be gearing up to finally launch its iPhone 6 at an event on 9 September. Reports claim the Californian tech giant has scheduled a ‘big media event’ for this date - and is expected to use it to unveil its next-generation of iPhones. The date ties in closely to previous events, which typically occur the second week of September. Reports claim Apple has scheduled a ‘big media event’ for 9 September, at which it is expected to unveil its next-generation iPhones. The date ties in closely to previous events, which typically occur the second week of September. Last year, Apple announced its iPhone 5S and 5C at an event on 10 September (invite pictured) Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres). Last year, Apple announced its iPhone 5S and 5C at an event on 10 September, before revealing its updated iPad range a month later. The claims were made by tech site Recode, but no official invites have been issued yet, and Apple has not confirmed the date. However, sources speaking to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal have also quoted the 9 September as the day Apple chief executive Tim Cook will unveil the new devices. Apple is expected to reveal a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model at the event, which is said to include a thinner, case - similar to that seen on last year’s iPad Air - an improved camera and a faster processor. It is likely to retain the fingerprint scanner introduced on the iPhone 5S. The event may also see the debut of a 5.5-inch ‘phablet’ handset. And if Apple follows suit from last year’s event, the rumoured iPad Air 2 could launch in the last week of October, alongside a watch. Earlier this week Apple filed for Healthkit trademarks in the US and Europe ahead of iOS 8 being officially launched, said to be next month. The software could be launched at the same media event on the 9 September. Apple is expected to reveal its 4.7-inch iPhone 6 at the event (concept pictured left), which is said to include a thinner, case - similar to that seen on last year’s iPad Air - an improved camera, and a faster processor. It is likely to retain the fingerprint scanner introduced on the iPhone 5S (pictured right) While the US filing covered software, the latest European paperwork makes references to health, fitness, exercise sensors, medical devices, and watches. In particular, it references ‘horological and chronometric instruments; watches; clocks; timepieces; chronographs for use as timepieces.' This adds weight to the rumours the watch is imminent. The claims were made by tech site Recode, but no official invites have been issued yet, and Apple has not confirmed the date. However, sources speaking to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal have also quoted the 9 September as the day chief executive Tim Cook (pictured at the iPhone 5S launch) will unveil the devices . Speculation . around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release . date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. Reports have previously claimed Apple's iWatch could double up as an activity tracker. This concept image reveals how the rumoured device and health tool might look. Dubbed the Diet Watch, it could track calories and steps as well as heart rate. It could launch at an event in October, alongside Apple's next iPad range .","Reports claim Apple has scheduled a ‘big media event’ for 9 September .

"By . Paul Revoir . and Liz Thomas . Updated: . 07:13 GMT, 7 October 2011 . Facing the axe: BBC2's daytime shows such as Flog It!, with Paul Martin,  and Cash In The Attic could be lost from schedules due to the Corporation's cuts . BBC2 will become the channel for repeats after the Corporation announced £1.3billion in cuts to ensure it no longer ‘takes the licence fee for granted’. More than half the channel’s  schedule will be devoted to reruns as bosses try to end decades of empire-building by taking an axe to  ‘luxuries’ they can ‘no longer afford’. Popular daytime shows at risk could include Cash in the Celebrity Attic and Flog It! Nearly all new daytime shows will now air on BBC1, which has been spared the brunt of the cuts. But despite cuts of 20 per cent, the BBC will still enjoy an annual budget of £3.5billion. The measures will lead to 2,000 redundancies – 800 in the news division – and the sale of Television Centre. Yesterday’s report unveiling the cuts also revealed that the broadcaster will: . But the Corporation faced embarrassment after its chief operating officer Caroline Thomson appeared to compare closing a channel to the NHS shutting hospitals. She said the BBC could not close any of its services because they were too valued by the public. Asked if any other publicly funded organisation could justify saying this, she told Radio 4’s PM Programme: ‘Ask the NHS about the problem of closing hospitals.’ It was BBC2 – once best known for its pioneering arts, science and drama – that emerged as the major loser from the cutbacks. Old shows will account for 56 per cent of its schedule. Hardly any new shows will appear before early evening, and prime time repeats will increase by 3 per cent. Switched on: BBC Director General Mark Thompson (centre) arrives at Television Centre in London with colleagues ahead of the announcement of cost-cutting proposals . Staying tuned: An employee checks his phone ahead of the announcement by the BBC at their headquarters in west London . During the day, apart from repeats, BBC2 will broadcast an international news bulletin, The Daily Politics and BBC World’s HardTalk. TOM UTLEY: 'Mark Thompson seems to forget that down here in the real world, where cash is actually earned and spent, £3500 million can still go quite a long way. He seems more concerned with width than quality and I fear he may have blown his chance to save Auntie Beeb.' The BBC will be saving £700million per year at the end of the five year process. It commissioned the Delivering Quality First report, which includes details of the cuts after the licence fee was last year frozen at £145.50 for six years. The report envisages a ‘smaller and radically reshaped BBC’. It said: ‘By 2016, the BBC will be significantly smaller than it is today; employing fewer people; occupying far less space; and spending less money both absolutely and as a proportion of the UK broadcasting industry.’ BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said: ‘We should be able to run an outstanding public service broadcaster on a budget of £3.5billion. ‘It is a privilege to be funded by the public through the licence fee. This privilege should neither be abused or taken for granted. New home: A further 1,000 BBC staff will be moved to the development in Salford to cut costs at the corporation . ‘With people and organisations everywhere in the UK obliged to pull in their belts, we cannot absolve ourselves at the BBC from the responsibility of responding to current economic realities.’ He said some things the BBC wanted to do were ‘luxuries’ that it ‘cannot afford’. But unions bitterly condemned plans to axe thousands of jobs and threatened strike action. They said more than 7,000 jobs had been lost at the BBC since 2004, adding that the situation ‘isn’t sustainable’. Gerry Morrissey, of Bectu, the media and entertainment union, said: ‘They are destroying jobs, and destroying the BBC.’ The Corporation has vowed to drive down the number of senior managers so they account for just 1 per cent of the organisation. But this will still leave the final tally at around 200. And staff axed as part of the job cuts could be back working at the BBC in as little as three months after the Corporation watered down its redundancy terms. At present, staff have to wait 12 months before they can return. But this ‘cooling off’ period has been reduced to just three months. Critics said many of those who pick up pay-offs could simply walk back into  freelance deals within weeks  of leaving. This would allow the BBC to make it look like it had taken tough action but actually offer workers a safety net. Elsewhere in the report, Radio 4 and BBC1 have been broadly protected from the axe with the Corporation’s output in natural history, popular science, drama and arts ring-fenced. But as part of the savings late night TV shows, from 10.30pm, will be slashed, raising big questions over the future of programmes such as A Question of Sport. It is understood flagship shows in these slots such as Question Time, Newsnight, Match of the Day and Graham Norton’s chat show will be protected. BBC3 and BBC4 have been saved from be scrapped altogether. Radio will also see more repeats, with Radio 2 and 5 Live cutting back comedy, and Radio 3 doing less drama and fewer lunch-time concerts. Executives have also been told that spending on talent fees – one of the biggest expenditures for stations – needs to drop on Radio 1 and Radio 2, which could see big name stars axed when their contract is up for renewal. Liberal Democrat MP Don Foster said: ‘I’m confident the BBC can save money while still preserving the high quality programming the public loves. It’s unfortunate that this has to happen and it is imperative that cuts should not lead to a lower quality BBC.’","BBC1 and Radio 4 are spared the brunt of the cuts .

Sharing pictures of him and his mini-me on Instagram, he gushed: 'I went to the city to become a model. 'I never expected to have a toy myself. 'I dreamt of being a human puppet, but having one in my image was completely unexpected.' Celso, a doll enthusiast, grew up with a shelf-full of dolls and started his transformation after winning a modelling contest at the age of 16. For years, he claims, his family had been telling him he looked like the doll - which inspired him to become 'a human puppet'. He changed his last name from Borges Pereira to Santebanes, the name of his favourite character on a Mexican TV show.

"By . Lillian Radulova . A neurosurgeon who was known to be addicted to cocaine and linked to the death of two prostitutes was allowed to continue practicing precise surgeries, ruining the lives of some of his trusting patients as he spiralled downhill. Dr Suresh Nair was eventually jailed for four years after he plead guilty to one count of manslaughter and two counts of supplying cocaine, a joint investigation by the ABC and Fairfax has revealed. The Malaysian-born doctor will now be deported back to his home country after his permanent residency was cancelled, but during his negligent stint at the Nepean Private hospital in Sydney's west, Dr Nair caused a life-time of damage to a number of his patients. Dr Suresh Nair was allowed to continue working as a neurosurgeon at the Nepean Private Hospital despite the NSW Medical Council being aware of his addiction to cocaine since 2004 . Carla Downes, who Dr Nair operated on three times, told the ABC that in her second operation Dr Nair operated at the wrong level of her spine, leading to seven years of constant pain and  leaving her unable to walk up a flight of stairs. In February 2009, a 23-year-old sex worker, Victoria McIntyre, died of a cocaine overdose after a night at the neurosurgeon's apartment . Another patient, Rhonda Taylor, told Fairfax that her mishandled spinal fusion, performed by Dr Nair in 2009, had ‘taken [her] life away’. Their testimonials have come after revelations that the NSW Medical Council and both the private and public Nepean hospitals were aware of Dr Nair’s cocaine addiction since 2004, when he was suspended for six weeks after a urine test found traces of cocaine in his system. However the Medical Board deemed it safe to stop performing drug tests on the surgeon in 2008, and despite the Nepean Public Hospital maintaining the former decision to ban him from performing surgeries, their private counterpart allowed him back into the operating theatre. At the time, Dr Nair was spending tens of thousands of dollars on prostitutes and hosting small drug parties in his home, according to the ABC. Even his co-workers, fellow neurosurgeons, began expressing doubts at Dr Nair's ability 'to function as a consultant' at this point, with one person describing his surgical decisions as 'often bizarre', Fairfax reports. In February 2009, a 23-year-old sex worker, Victoria McIntyre, died of a cocaine overdose after a night at the neurosurgeon's apartment. Patients who the Malaysian-born surgeon operated on have revealed they have were left with life-long problems after his surgeries went wrong . Dr Nair was arrested in 2010 following the death of a second escort at his home. 19-year-old Suellen Domingues-Zaupa, died after suffering a cardiac arrest from a cocaine overdose . While the hospital was informed of the incident, the NSW Medical Council was not, and Dr Nair continued to work. Later in the same year, 19-year-old escort Suellen Domingues-Zaupa, also died at Dr Nair's home after suffering a cardiac arrest from a cocaine overdose. Finally, after this incident, Dr Nair was arrested and his medical licence was revoked in 2010.The full media investigation can be seen on Monday at 8:30pm on ABC's Four Corners.","Dr Suresh Nair was banned from the operating theatre for six weeks in 2004 after a drug test found cocaine in his sytem .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When strangers kept telling Aron Dale he was a dead ringer for Harry Styles, the student hit on a brilliant idea. He gave up university in the hope of making a lucrative living as a lookalike of the One Direction heart-throb. But the 25-year-old has had only six jobs in more than a year – mostly at children’s parties – at £100 a time. Scroll down for video . Lookalike: Aron Dale, of Redcar, North Yorkshire, insists that whenever he goes shopping he is 'surrounded' by screaming fans who think he really is the floppy-haired One Direction singer . Similar?

The former engineering student claims . he is a ‘distraction’ for women who cannot stop looking at him - and . often brings crowds of females ‘to a standstill’. He . added: ‘At first I didn’t really notice I looked like Harry because One . Direction is more for young girls, so I didn’t really take an interest . in the band. ‘But soon . people were stopping and gawping at me in the streets and friends and . family were commenting on our similar looks.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Zimbabwe is one of the poorest country's on Earth, but clearly despot Robert Mugabe doesn't seem to care on his 89th birthday. The president celebrated it by immortalising himself in freshly minted gold coins and held a lavish party with a giant cake. Guests, including his wife, first lady Grace, tucked into the four-tier treat made in his honour at the state house before he gave a thank-you speech. Minted: Zimbabwe dictator Robert Mugabe had the coins made to celebrate his 89th birthday . The celebration came amid accusations that Mugabe is losing his grip on a country he has ruled since coming to power in 1980 and resorting to violence. His party are suspected of being involved in the death of the 12-year-old son of a local official who is supporter of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Christpowers Maisiri was burned to death while sleeping in a hut with his brothers last weekend in Headlands district, 110 miles east of Harare. Birthday boy: Robert Mugabe celebrates with his wife Grace, right, as they have a slice from the four-tier cake at the party in Harare . Tsvangirai and Mugabe were forced . into a power-sharing government in 2009 and will resume their rivalry in . elections expected around July. The MDC quickly blamed Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, saying the alleged killers were after the boy's father, Shepherd. ZANU-PF denied killing the boy and accused the MDC of trying to fan pre-election tensions in the southern African state. Thank-you: Mugabe makes a speech at the party to celebrate his birthday . ""ZANU-PF is under siege, 'Tsvangirai . said while addressing mourners and supporters attending the burial in . Headlands, a tobacco-growing district. 'They are in a corner and this is a desperate act from a party that is losing power.' Fighting back tears, Shepherd Maisiri said he had been subjected to violence and intimidation from ZANU-PF supporters since 2000. His son had been born in the bush because his parents had to flee from opponents, he said. Tsvangirai said he had shown Mugabe pictures of the charred remains of the boy during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday and that the president had 'shrunk' in disbelief and ordered a full investigation. Tsvangirai, former trade union leader was forced to quit a presidential run-off race in 2008 after 200 of his supporters died in political violence blamed on ZANU-PF members. 'We are hurt but not intimidated. This has to end, starting with the arrest of the people who committed this heinous crime,' said Tsvangirai. He said he could not vouch for Mugabe's sincerity when calling for peaceful elections.","Four-tier cake made in his honour at Zimbabwe's state house party .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . A police station had to be sealed off for three hours after officers spilled a bottle of party drug GBL onto the carpet. Firefighters spent three hours decontaminating the office, after the chemical spilled from a half-litre plastic bottle. The colourless Class C drug, which is an irritant, was being stored as evidence at Brighton police station in East Sussex  when the incident took place. Brighton Police Station in East Sussex had to be sealed off for three hours after officers spilled a bottle of party drug GBL onto the carpet . The colourless class C drug was being stored as evidence at the police station when the incident took place . No-one was harmed or came into contact with the liquid, but Sussex police said an investigation has been launched. GBL - the full name of which is gammabutyrolacton - is converted to chemical gammahydroxybutrate (GHB), or 'liquid Ecstasy', after entering the body. The drug, sometimes referred to as 'coma in a bottle', produces a feeling of euphoria, sleepiness and reduces inhibitions. Its cheap price makes it a popular party drug. It has been blamed for several deaths, including Sussex University medical student Hester Stewart in 2009. Sussex Police has launched an investigation into the incident. There were no reported injuries and no-one came into contact with the drug, which is also an irritant . Firefighters spent three hours decontaminating the office, after a half-litre plastic bottle of the chemical was spilled . GBL and GHB are also used by date rapists to spike drinks because it is odourless and colourless and can be out of a victim’s system within 12 hours. The drug is available for legitimate use in industry. But if someone supplies or possesses the drug, knowing or believing it will be swallowed and ingested, they are committing an offence. Possession is punishable by up to two years in prison or an unlimited fine, while suppliers can face up to four years in jail. GBL is an odourless liquid sold in small bottles or capsules, costing about £15 for 30ml. It is usually diluted with water or juice and is virtually tasteless, but produces a high not dissimilar to ecstasy. It can damage the kidneys, liver and the stomach lining and can lead to psychosis. Once in the body, chemical reactions turn GBL into now notorious drug GHB - known as 'liquid Ecstasy' - which was banned in 2003 because it was being used as a date rape drug. Although legal for use in the chemical industry - in cleaning products, solvents and paints - it has been banned for recreational use since 2009 and is a Class C drug. Overdoses are common, with as little as one teaspoon enough to put the user in a coma. That is how the nickname 'coma in a bottle' came about. Deaths that have been linked with GBL include that of Sarah O'Dowd, 24, who drowned in her bath in October 2007. Lynette Nock, 28, died in 2012 after taking the drug. She was at a memorial party for her friend Carl Fearon, who had died after taking the drug the day before. Brighton medical student Hester Stewart died in April 2009 after taking GBL and drinking alcohol. A 25-year-old man died hours after taking GBL on its own while out clubbing in 2008. But because traces of GBL remain in the body for only up to 12 hours after consumption, the true number of fatalities is unknown. Anyone caught in possession of the drug can face an unlimited fine and up to two years in prison. Suppliers can face up to four years in jail.","Firefighters spent 3 hours decontaminating office after liquid went on carpet .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . O.J. Simpson is receiving tests for brain cancer and is begging President Barack Obama for a pardon so he can die in peace at home, according to a new report. The jailed former football legend, who is serving out a kidnapping, assault and robbery sentence in a Nevada prison, is undergoing secret medical exams for a cancerous tumor in his brain and is convinced he hasn't got long to live, The National Enquirer reports. The publication reported just months ago that the 66-year-old had such an extreme case of diabetes that his life was at risk and brain cancer would certainly add to his health woes. Tests: O.J. Simpson, pictured at a court hearing in May, is receiving tests for brain cancer and is begging President Barack Obama for a pardon so he can die in peace at home, according to The National Enquirer . 'O.J. says his memory is slipping and . he gets painful headaches and other symptoms,' a source told The . Enquirer, listing blurry vision, occasional stuttering and hearing . problems as other concerns. He also at times feels confused and has unusual bursts of anger and fits of depression. 'He . put off the doctors for weeks after he first started experiencing the . symptoms because he was afraid of what they would find,' the source said. 'Now the prison docs . are telling him they believe he has a brain tumor. They plan to run a . series of tests on him, MRIs and CT scans.' The . Enquirer reports that Simpson has finally agreed to the tests and is . convinced he hasn't got long to live, telling a friend, 'I feel the end . coming. But I don't want to die in prison like common jailhouse scum.' The publication reports he has even begged President Obama for a pardon so he can die comfortably at home. Diabetes? The newspaper reported just months ago that the 66-year-old had such an extreme case of diabetes that his life was at risk . Before . Simpson is eligible for parole, he has to serve another four year of . his 33 year sentence at the Lovelock Correctional Center. The . Enquirer reports Simpson tried to lose weight by sticking to a strict . diet and exercise plan after a diabetes-related health scare a few . months ago, but it was a struggle. 'He . began suffering dizzy spells, nausea, lapses in memory and headaches - . and the frightening symptoms continue to get worse,' the source is . quoted as saying. The article claims Simpson, in a last ditch attempt for freedom, wrote to the . President and said 'Mr President, I know my life is coming to an end. Please, don't let me die in prison.' In . July, The Enquirer reported Simpson had just months to live as a result . of his extreme case of diabetes and unhealthy lifestyle behind bars. The . combination of 'sky high' blood pressure, a vastly expanding waistline . and a lack of physical activity had doctors concerned about his health, . the magazine reported at the time. Court: Simpson was convicted of a slew of charges on October 3, 2008 - the 13th anniversary of the day he was controversially acquitted of killing his ex-wife Nicole brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman . Simpson's lawyer Ozzie Fumo told MailOnline that he has not heard anything about his clients poor health. 'As . far as I know his health is very good, he was doing just fine,' Fumo . said. 'I spent a lot of time with him preparing for the retrial motion . and he never once mentioned diabetes. 'We discussed health issues, we had meals together, and he seemed fine.' The . first warning signs came during a court hearing in May when the former . running-back looked much heavier than he ever had before. In . the July story, The Enquirer claimed Simpson weighed 300 pounds and . prison doctors encouraged him to exercise and eat more healthily to . combat the high blood pressure and diabetes. He had developed a habit of . passing the days by laying in bed in his prison cell and only getting up . to get sugar-filled snacks, it reported. 'OJ's . doctors have told him he could be dead in as little as three months . because of his out-of-control blood sugar and blood pressure,' an . unidentified prison friend told The Enquirer in the summer. In healthier days: In this October 3, 1995 photo, O.J. Simpson, center, appears in far better health as he reacts to being cleared of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman . 'But OJ doesn't care. He knows he's never going to get out of prison, so he refuses to take care of himself.' The 33-years he faces following a 2008 robbery are not helping motivate Simpson, as he is now making plans for his death. He . allegedly confessed to murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her . friend Ron Goldman in 1994 and told a prison friend that he will write a . confession letter that will be sent- and then publicly shared- after he . dies. Fumo countered this claim, saying that in his months of interactions with Simpson he has 'never once disparaged the Goldmans'. 'In his mind, they're creditors along with his children Sydney and Justin,' Fumo said. The . friends cited by The Enquirer said the double slaying came in a moment . of rage that he regrets to this day because he still loves Nicole.","The jailed former football legend is undergoing secret medical exams for a cancerous tumor in his brain and is convinced he hasn't got long to live, The National Enquirer reports .

It is hoped it will allow astronomers to learn about our origins by peering back to almost the first moments after the universe was formed. Scroll down for videos . A £1 billion 'time machine', which could finally reveal mysteries of the universe, is complete. The last giant antenna (pictured) for Alma, the world's largest land-based observatory, recently arrived in Chile allowing scientists to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before . The Alma array is situated high on the Chajnantor Plateau, a remote area of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile at 16,400 feet (5,000 metres) above sea level. There, the dryness and altitude create some of the best conditions for observing the night sky. With the latest arrival, the observatory combines the forces of 66 radio antennae, most almost 40 feet (12 metres) in diameter. Combined, they make the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (Alma) accurate enough to see a golf ball nine miles (15 km) away.

It is hoped Alma will allow astronomers to learn about our origins by peering back to almost the first moments after the universe was formed . Babak Tafreshi, one of the ESO Photo Ambassadors, has captured the antennae of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (Alma) under the southern sky in another breathtaking image . Alma is situated high on the Chajnantor Plateau, an area of the Atacama Desert in Chile . With all the antennae working in unison as a giant telescope, the observatory will provide astronomers with a window into the early universe. This is where cosmic secrets wait to be discovered, said project director Pierre Cox, who added Alma is poised to reach its full potential next year. ‘Up to now Alma’s observations and data were published with 16 to 20 antennae, now we're going to have double that or more, hence there will be a jump in sensitivity: better, quicker and more data,’ Cox said. I think there will be a real stream of scientific results in the coming months and years.’ The new dish is the 25th European antenna to be transported up to the observatory. It will work alongside 25 other antennae from North America and four from East Asia, as well as 12 smaller 22ft (7 metre) dishes from East Asia. Some of the Alma antennae bathed in red light. In the background there is the southern Milky Way on the left . The $1.6 billion telescope, which began full-scale operation in March, has already spotted galaxies expelling gas and a star formation near the centre of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole. It also has captured the first image of an icy ring around a distant star. By collecting radio waves rather than optical light, Alma can look through the dense dust clouds of deep space. This will give astronomers a glimpse of galaxies from just after the Big Bang. It can also look at how individual stars and planets are formed. This could shine a light on our creation as it is believed the elements spewed out by dying stars went on the seed the sun, the planets and, eventually, humans. Radio telescope antennas of the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) project . The secret to Alma's incredible resolution comes from two factors: height and distance. The observatory's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500ft (5,000 metres) above sea level. This is far above most of Earth's atmosphere and water vapour, which obscures observations. Astronomers working in Alma's facility at 9,500 feet (2,900 meters) must use supplemental oxygen for extended stays. The system currently comprises about 50 functional antennas. When the array is finished, there will be 66 of these receivers that can be moved as far as 16km (9.9m) apart. The . antennae capture astronomical signals from the sky individually, then . combine their results in a supercomputer to get precise information . about where the signals come from. Researchers say it is similar to how we use our two ears to locate sounds around us, but on a universe-size scale. This . high-resolution not only lets Alma observe young planetary systems, but . also pin down hydrogen and life-building blocks in gas clouds. The array can also track the evolution of galaxies.","Last giant antenna for Alma recently arrived in Chile's Chajnantor Plateau .

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . Killer: Robert Hansen, pictured in an old mugshot, has passed away of natural causes aged 75 . Alaska serial killer Robert Hansen, who admitted to killing 17 women and raping 30 more before he was portrayed by John Cusack in a movie about the slayings, has died of natural causes aged 75. Hansen, a former Anchorage baker who earned the nickname 'the Butcher Baker' after abducting and hunting down women during the 1970s, passed away at 1.30am on Thursday at the Alaska Regional Hospital. He was transferred to the hospital on Wednesday after being in declining health for the past year, Alaska Department of Corrections spokeswoman Sherrie Daigle said. She added that it appeared as if he died of natural causes but the exact cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner. Hansen was serving a 461-year sentence after being convicted in 1984 of murdering the women. He confessed to killing 17 young women, mostly dancers and prostitutes, during a 12-year span but he was convicted of just four of the murders in a deal that spared him having to go to trial 17 times. He also confessed to raping another 30 women in that time. He had been incarcerated at the Seward state prison and was moved May 11, 2014, to the Anchorage Correctional Center to receive medical attention. In 2006, Hansen rejected a request to be interviewed by The Associated Press. Scroll down for video . Caught: Hansen is pictured in 1983 after he was caught and admitted to killing at least 17 women and raping 30 others in Anchorage in the 1970s and early 1980s. He was a quiet baker and married with children . Creepy: Hansen, a licensed pilot and hunter, is pictured  with the horns from a record Dall sheep he killed before he was arrested. Sometimes he would let his victims go and then hunt them down with his rifle . 'I do not care so much for myself, but you journalist (sic) have hurt my family so very much,' Hansen wrote in a typo-riddled, unsigned letter from Alaska's Spring Creek Correctional Center in Seward. Hansen had owned a bakery in a downtown mini-mall in the 1970s and 1980s. He lived across town with his wife and children, who knew nothing of his other life. Construction of the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the 1970s brought prostitutes, pimps, con artists and drug dealers to Alaska's largest city, all aiming to separate construction workers from some of the big money they were pulling in. Many who looked for quick riches left as abruptly as they arrived in Anchorage, making sudden disappearances commonplace. Killed: Among his victims, he killed Andrea Altiery (left) and kept her necklace as a trophy. Police also believe he murdered Megan Emerick (right), who was just 17 when she vanished in 1973 . Victims: Sherry Morrow, 23, (left) was last seen in 1981 and shot while naked before she was dressed and buried in a shallow grave. Paula Goulding (right), a 17-year-old dancer, was killed in the same way . Glenn Flothe, a then-trooper who helped put Hansen behind bars, told the Anchorage Daily News in 2008 that Hansen's victims initially included any woman who caught his eye, but Hansen quickly learned that strippers and prostitutes were harder to track and less likely to be missed. John Cusack portrayed Hansen in a 2013 film about the killings, while Nicolas Cage played the detective . Hansen would abduct the women and take them to remote places outside the city. Sometimes, he would drive, and other times he would fly his private plane. A licensed pilot, Hansen told investigators one of his favorite spots to take his victims was the Knik River northeast of Anchorage. Many of the bodies were found there in shallow graves. Investigators have said that in some instances Hansen would rape the women but return them to Anchorage, warning them not to contact authorities. Other times, he would let the women go free in the wilderness and then hunt them with his rifle. In June 1983, one of his victims, Cindy Paulson, managed to escape his car as he loaded his plane to take her to his cabin. He had already tortured and raped her, and she was still handcuffed when she ran from his car to flag down passing traffic. She described the kidnapper and his plane to authorities, but when police questioned him, he had an alibi and a gentle demeanor, so they let him go. But after some bodies were found by hunters in the area, investigators re-visited suspects and realized he fit the profile. His alibi - two friends - also admitted they had been lying. They searched his plane, home and car and found he had some items, including jewelry, that had belonged to the women. Only 12 bodies of the 17 women Hansen confessed to killing have been found. The others were never located. Hansen became the subject of a 2013 film titled, 'The Frozen Ground,' which starred Nicolas Cage as an Alaska State Trooper investigating the slayings. Actor John Cusack portrayed Hansen.","Robert Hansen was serving a 461-year sentence for the killings when he passed away on Thursday, apparently of natural causes .

After taking a self-portrait, the digital artist started to sketch himself into the picture. But rather than completely transforming his pictures into a complete sketch, the artist only partially adapted the original pictures, creating an interesting composite effect. This is then used to make the photographs appear in part like black and white paintings. Scroll down for video . Artist Sebastien Del Grosso sketches himself into selfies he has taken to make the pictures look like paintings . He first came up with the idea when he wanted to update his Facebook profile picture and he has since developed a quirky collection of images . Rather than completely transforming his pictures into a complete sketch, Mr Del Grosso adapted the original pictures, creating an interesting composite effect . Mr Del Grosso, who was taught to draw by his grandmother, uses the sketches to illustrate his life and events that have been important to him. He said: 'My grandmother taught me to draw, and by watching her drawing and painting made me want to do the same. 'It's always important to remember the history behind an image, as it helps to produce a quality image. 'When I make a creative image, I try to attract the attention of the viewer and hold it.' He said: 'My grandmother taught me to draw, and by watching her drawing and painting made me want to do the same' The whole process, from the shooting to the final image, can take a few hours to several days. He said: 'The pencil strokes are fast and nervous, and so give the impression of a construction. 'Then, my ""dodge and burn"" effect is used a lot in the final rendering. 'It is in fact a multitude of brush strokes, black or white, which serve to highlight, or rather mitigate some facial features, and clothing. 'This treatment is intended to look like a little more like a painting than a photo. This allows me to make it more pleasant to the eye.' He added: 'All my pictures are taken inside my apartment, using only natural light. 'The drawings are done with a simple pencil on a sheet of paper. Then the drawing is scanned, cleaned and added to the picture with Photoshop tools. 'I take thousands of images using a remote control, and then choose a selection of my favourites.' Following his sketching success, Mr Del Grosso now hopes to to develop his series further. He said: 'I have many more creative and innovative ideas in my head and they will be challenging. But I hope I will be successful in achieving them all.'","Sebastien Del Grosso, from Paris, sketches himself into a picture he has taken to make the photographs look like black and white paintings .

"By . Associated Press . Ten of thousands of birds flying over California are being scorched to death each year by powerful sun beams from the world's largest solar plant. The birds have been dubbed 'streamers' by workers at the plant in the Mojave Desert, for the smoke plume that comes from them as they ignite in midair. Federal wildlife investigators visited the BrightSource Energy plant last year and watched as birds burned and fell, reporting an average of one 'streamer' every two minutes. Scroll down for video . Body count: Some experts estimate the Ivanpah Dry Lake solar plant in California scorches around 30,000 birds per year in mid-air . They are now are urging California officials to halt the operator's application to build a still-bigger version of the plant. Estimates per year now range from a low of about a thousand by BrightSource to 28,000 by an expert for the Center for Biological Diversity environmental group. The deaths are 'alarming. It's hard to say whether that's the location or the technology,' said Garry George, renewable-energy director for the California chapter of the Audubon Society. 'There needs to be some caution.' The bird deaths mark the latest instance in which the quest for clean energy sometimes has inadvertent environmental harm. Debate: Plant officials dispute that all the streamers are caused by birds. Pictured is MacGillivray's Warbler that was found at the Ivanpah solar plant . Solar farms have been criticised for their impacts on desert tortoises, and wind farms have killed birds, including numerous raptors. 'We take this issue very seriously,' said Jeff Holland, a spokesman for NRG Solar of Carlsbad, California, the second of the three companies behind the plant. The third, Google, deferred comment to its partners. Wildlife officials who witnessed the phenomena say many of the clouds of smoke were too big to come from anything but a bird, and they add that they saw the 'birds entering the solar flux and igniting, consequently become a streamer.' The $2.2 billion (£1.32 billion) plant, which launched . in February, is at Ivanpah Dry Lake near the California-Nevada border. The operator says it is the world's biggest plant to employ so-called . power towers. More than . 300,000 mirrors, each the size of a garage door, reflect solar rays onto . three boiler towers each looming up to 40 stories high. The water . inside is heated to produce steam, which turns turbines that generate . enough electricity for 140,000 homes. Sun rays sent up by the field of mirrors are bright enough to dazzle pilots flying in and out of Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Federal wildlife officials . said Ivanpah might act as a 'mega-trap' for wildlife, with the bright . light of the plant attracting insects, which in turn attract . insect-eating birds that fly to their death in the intensely focused . light rays. Federal and . state biologists call the number of deaths significant, based on . sightings of birds getting singed and falling, and on retrieval of . carcasses with feathers charred too severely for flight. Ivanpah . officials dispute the source of the so-called streamers, saying at . least some of the puffs of smoke mark insects and bits of airborne trash . being ignited by the solar rays. High tech, high mortality rate: More than 300,000 mirrors, each the size of a garage door, reflect solar rays onto three boiler towers each looming up to 40 stories high. When birds fly through the powerful reflected light, they're scorched and leave a trail of smoke . Federal wildlife officials said Ivanpah might act as a 'mega-trap' for wildlife, with the bright light of the plant attracting insects, which in turn attract insect-eating birds that fly to their death in the intensely focused rays . U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials say they want a death toll for a full year of operation. Given the apparent scale of bird deaths at Ivanpah, authorities should thoroughly track bird kills there for a year, including during annual migratory seasons, before granting any more permits for that kind of solar technology, said Mr George, of the Audubon Society. The toll on birds has been surprising, said Robert Weisenmiller, chairman of the California Energy Commission. 'We didn't see a lot of impact' on birds at the first, smaller power towers in the U.S. and Europe, Weisenmiller said. The commission is now considering the application from Oakland-based BrightSource to build a mirror field and a 75-story power tower that would reach above the sand dunes and creek washes between Joshua Tree National Park and the California-Arizona border. The proposed plant is on a flight path for birds between the Colorado River and California's largest lake, the Salton Sea — an area, experts say, is richer in avian life than the Ivanpah plant, with protected golden eagles and peregrine falcons and more than 100 other species of birds recorded there. Unsettling: Authorities at the plant call the trails of smoke left by scorched birds 'streamers' U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials warned California this month that the power-tower style of solar technology holds 'the highest lethality potential' of the many solar projects burgeoning in the deserts of California. The commission's staff estimates the proposed new tower would be almost four times as dangerous to birds as the Ivanpah plant. The agency is expected to decide this autumn on the proposal. While biologists say there is no known feasible way to curb the number of birds killed, the companies behind the projects say they are hoping to find one — studying whether lights, sounds or some other technology would scare them away, said Joseph Desmond, senior vice president at BrightSource Energy. Massive: The $2.2 billion plant part-owned by Google is the world's largest and company BrightSource Energy wants to build one even bigger . BrightSource also is offering $1.8 (£1.08) million in compensation for anticipated bird deaths at Palen, Desmond said. The company is proposing the money for programs such as those to spay and neuter domestic cats, which a government study found kill over 1.4 billion birds a year. Opponents say that would do nothing to help the desert birds at the proposed site. Power-tower proponents are fighting to keep the deaths from forcing a pause in the building of new plants when they see the technology on the verge of becoming more affordable and accessible, said Thomas Conroy, a renewable-energy expert. When it comes to powering the country's grids, 'diversity of technology ... is critical,' Mr Conroy said. 'Nobody should be arguing let's be all coal, all solar,' all wind, or all nuclear. 'And every one of those technologies has a long list of pros and cons.' The BrightSource Energy plant is located in the Mojave Desert. It is currently the largest solar thermal power plant in the world . Even bigger: The California Energy Commission is now considering the application from Oakland-based BrightSource to build a mirror field and a 75-story power tower that would reach above the sand dunes and creek washes between Joshua Tree National Park and the California-Arizona border .","Experts claim California solar array is killing nearly 30,000 birds per year .

"By . Jill Reilly for MailOnline . Porn and Top Gear and Angry Birds have all been downloaded to computers by internet users in North Korea -  a country with notoriously restrictive online policies. Few people in North Korea can access the internet which means citizens are starved of any information besides government propaganda. But according to Scan Eye, which monitors BitTorrent, a protocol for sharing files over the internet, IP addresses in Pyongyang, shows that 178 files have been downloaded. Top Gear is one of 178 files downloaded to computers by internet users in North Korea - a country with notoriously restrictive online policies . The downloads by computers registered in Pyongyang include Modern Family, The Martin Lewis Money Show and The Apprentice. On the list there is also downloads of Japanese and US pornography and of several computer games, including Angry Birds. Ernesto Van Der Sar, who edits the TorrentFreak blog, told The Telegraph that while it is possible to spoof IP addresses, it was unlikely that anyone was routing their traffic through North Korea. 'These IP addresses are registered to North Korea and there is no known Virtual Network Provider operating in that range,' he said. There were also downloads of Japanese and American pornography and of several computer games, including Angry Birds . 'This makes it likely that the traffic is indeed originating from the area.' Computer and cellphone use is gaining ground in North Korea's larger cities. However, most North Koreans only have access to a domestic Intranet system, not the World Wide Web. For North Koreans, internet use is still strictly regulated and allowed only with approval. Computers at Pyongyang's main library at the Grand People's Study House are linked to a domestic service that allows them to read only state-run media online and access a trove of reading materials approved by North Korean officials. The downloads by computers registered in Pyongyang (pictured) But even the local Intranet is limited to the politically sound among the 24 million strong population, according to Kim Heung-kwang, a North Korean computer engineering expert who defected to South Korea in 2004. 'I think around 100,000 people can use Intranet. 'There's a North Korean version of portal service called 'Naenara' (My Country) and people can download content posted there,' he said. 'People could do emails and chats until 2008, then the government shut down these services... (Now) It's all about digital content from propaganda papers such as Rodong Sinmun (the main ruling party daily) or little games.' According to North Korean law, the punishment for using anti-regime or 'bourgeois' cultural content ranges from three months to two years of hard labour. In severe cases, the code allows up to five years of re-education through labor.","Few people in North Korea can access the world wide web .

"By . Alex Lazcano For Daily Mail Australia . The miracle koala who clung for his life to the grille of a car for nearly 90kms after being hit, has recovered from his injuries and released back into the wild. Nicknamed Blinky Grille, the koala arrived at the Australia Zoo Wildlife hospital four weeks ago after colliding with a car on the Bruce Highway, three hours north of Brisbane. Blinky surprised staff at the hospital by escaping with minimal injuries, suffering just a broken toenail, superficial trauma to the nose and a case of Chlamydia, which is common in the marsupials. All his ailments have been successfully treated. Timberwolf the miracle Koala released back into the wild after being in treatment at Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital for four weeks. Dr Amber Gillett, the Senior Veterinarian at Australia Zoo who treated the koala, was thrilled to see him released after treating him for the past month. 'Not all koalas that come into contact with cars are so lucky, which is why being able to release Timberwolf was the best result we could have hoped for,' said Dr Gillett. He was found at a service station near Gympie after he was hit by a car at Maryborough 90 kilometers away. Blinky Grill was lucky enough that the owner of the car he'd clung to took him to a local vet, who then had him taken into the care of vets at Australia Zoo. Blinky Grille, hailed a miracle koala, was released in a large koala habitat bushland outside of Maryborough. 'Timberwolf leapt from one eucalypt to another' on his release back in the wild . Before and after: Timberwolf the koala who clung to a bumper bar for 90kms was treated for minor injuries and has been released to a koala habitat in Queensland . Once released he leapt from one eucalyptus tree to another, giving Dr Gillett confidence that he would remain the survivor that came through the hospital doors at the end of July. 'Timberwolf is a tough koala and the fact that he's exploring his environment confidently indicates that he's still fit and healthy after being in care with us for three weeks,' she said. Timberwolf nicknamed Blinky Grille was x-rayed on arrival at the Australia Zoo wildlife hospital to check the extent of his injuries . The Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital sees more than 800 koala patients each year. More than half of these are suffering from trauma caused by being hit by cars and other vehicles, followed closely by injuries from domestic dog attacks and disease. The Wildlife Hospital relies on donations from the public to continue its work to help koalas like Timberwolf and ultimately safeguard the species.

For United can only play a maximum of 46 games this season after being dumped out of the Capital One Cup, which will be their lowest in at least 27 years. Van Gaal inherited a team that was out of Europe and could only focus on domestic competitions, so it was somewhat bewildering that the Dutch boss elected to rest several first-teamers when travelling to Stadium mk.

Everton 67, Arsenal 68, Tottenham 69, even Hull City could reach the 71 game mark should they make all their finals. The figures gathered take into account every game, including replays, a team could face in the 2014/15 season. Now, United can only look forward to the league and the FA Cup. This is not what they're used to. The Red Devils have not dipped below playing 50 games a season since the 1995/96 campaign, while the last time they played 46 games was in '81/82. You have to go as far back as 1958/59 to find what United's realistic total could be this year, 43.

That season included a Champions League and Capital One Cup final, a Club World Cup, and an FA Cup semi. How times have changed. There could be the argument that Van Gaal's side could flourish playing less games while their so-called rivals are on their European venture in the week. United won't even play a midweek fixture until December. But should their strength in depth be so weak? The likes of Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo will certainly improve things at Old Trafford with their ability to operate in different positions, but against MK Dons, these were the man backing up the first team.

Meanwhile, City and Chelsea in particular can rely on a star-studded bench in a trusted system to ease past lowly position.

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . When a painter and decorator scooped £7million in the lottery, he thought all of his prayers had been answered. But like many millionaires before him, Willie Sibbald learned the hard way that money can't buy everything, after being turned away from a pub where he was already banned for  drunken behaviour. The 48-year-old from Newington, Edinburgh, was eager to celebrate his windfall after handing in his notice last week. Willie Sibbald was celebrating his £7million win when he was turned away from The Grapes pub in Edinburgh . Mr Sibbald, who had vowed to split his winnings with his best friend, Rab Layden, went to the pub on Friday night. But the millionaire wasn't able to enjoy a single drink, after staff refused him service. Gordon Turnball, manager at the pub, said: 'I wasn't working but I heard from staff he popped his head in to say hello to his mates. 'He'd had a fair bit to drink already and he knew not to get served. 'He misbehaved in the past but he's never been violent or anything like that. The Grapes isn't a regular haunt of his, he comes in from time to time. The 47-year-old had already been drinking when he went to the pub last weekend. He is pictured celebrating receiving his cheque . Staff at The Grapes said Mr Sibbald was not a regular customer but had been refused service in the past . 'I'd happily let him in and serve him if he behaved properly just like anyone else.' After collecting his cheque for £7,084,472 on August 12, Mr Sibbald said he would split the money with his best friend to 'see him right'. The pair had been buying two tickets each every week for years. 'We used to say ""Imagine it was us, what would you do?"" But you never expect it,' he said. Mr Sibbald (right) vowed to split his winnings with his best friend Rab Layden (left) 'It's one of those things you say. You're sitting there eating your piece and you'd say ""Rab, imagine if we won this, you'd never need to work again."" But you never really think it's going to happen.' The football fans are now looking forward to following the Tartan Army to away games across the world. Mr Layden, 57, was painting a kitchen when he was told he'd never have to work again. 'He phoned me at 1.45pm and said ""By the way I've got something to tell you, are you sitting down? I'm the guy that won the lottery"" - and I about collapsed. 'I then met him at the yard and told the bosses at 2.40pm and retired five minutes later. Then we went for a pint.' 'The trust and the loyalty is there, there was never any doubt about it. Truth and honesty always comes to the fore.' Speaking of his plans for the future, Mr Sibbald said he wanted to buy a Rolls Royce. 'It's been such a whirlwind I've not had time to really think about what I will do with the money but I will probably learn to drive and get myself a car,' he said.","Willie Sibbald won more than £7million in Lucky Dip earlier this month .
