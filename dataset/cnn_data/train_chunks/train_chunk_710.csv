The earliest known complete nervous system preserved in the fossilised remains of a creature that crawled and swam in the ocean 520 million years ago has been discovered. Scientists believe it shows the moment the ancestors of spiders and scorpions evolved from other insects and demonstrates how spiders' biting mouth parts evolved from its ancestor's appendages. The creature is an ancestor of chelicerates which branched off from the family tree of other arthropods, including insects, crustaceans and millipedes. This is a close-up of the head region of the Alalcomenaeus fossil specimen with the superimposed colours of a microscopy technique revealing the distribution of chemical elements in the fossil. Copper shows up as blue, iron as magenta and the CT scans as green. The coincidence of iron and CT denote nervous system . Chelicerates include horsehoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, mites and ticks. They originated as marine animals in the Cambrian period and surviving species include four species of horsehoe crabs. There are over 77,000 modern species of air-breathing chelicerates, but there could be as many as 500,000 unidentified species. Like all arthropods, chelicerates have segmented bodies with jointed limbs, all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins. The chelicerae, which give the group its name, are the only appendages that appear before the mouth. In most sub-groups, they are modest pincers used to feed but spiders' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey. Chelicerates were originally predators, but the group has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans - Greek for large claws - and solves the long-standing mystery of where this group fits in the tree of life. Professor Nick Strausfeld in the University of Arizona's department of neuroscience said: 'We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions. 'This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian.' Working together with London's Natural History Museum, the scientists identified the 3cm long creature unearthed from the famous Chengjiang formation near Kunming in southwest China, as a representative of the extinct genus Alalcomenaeus. Animals in this group had an elongated, segmented body equipped with about a dozen pairs of body appendages enabling them to swim and crawl, according to the study, published in Nature. They all featured a pair of long, scissor-like appendages attached to the head, most likely for grasping or sensory purposes, which gave them their collective name, megacheirans. This is an illustration of the nervous systems of the Alalcomenaeus fossil (left), a larval horseshoe crab (middle) and a scorpion (right). Diagnostic features revealing the evolutionary relationships among these animals include the forward position of the gut opening in the brain and the arrangement of optic centres outside and inside the brain supplied by two pairs of eyes . Greg Edgecombe, of London's Natural History Museum, said some palaeontologists had used the external appearance of the great appendage to infer that the megacheirans were related to chelicerates. This was based on the fact that the great appendage and the fangs of a spider or scorpion both have an 'elbow joint' between their basal part and their pincer-like tip. 'However, this wasn't rock solid because others lined up the great appendage either a segment in front of spider fangs or one segment behind them,' he said. 'We have now managed to add direct evidence from which segment the brain sends nerves into the great appendage. 'It's the second one, the same as in the fangs, or chelicerae. For the first time we can analyse how the segments of these fossil arthropods line up with each other the same way as we do with living species - using their nervous systems.' The team analysed the fossil by applying different imaging and image processing techniques, taking advantage of iron deposits that had selectively accumulated in the nervous system during fossilisation. The fossil shows the typical hallmarks of the brains found in scorpions and spiders - three clusters of nerve cells known as ganglia fused together as a brain also fused with some of the animal's body ganglia. Professor Nick Strausfeld in the University of Arizona's department of neuroscience said: 'We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs (pictured) and scorpions' This differs from crustaceans where ganglia are further apart and connected by long nerves, like the rungs of a rope ladder. Other diagnostic features include the forward position of the gut opening in the brain and the arrangement of optic centres outside and inside the brain supplied by two pairs of eyes, just like in horseshoe crabs. Professor Strausfeld said: 'Greg plugged these characteristics into a computer-based cladistic analysis to ask, ""where does this fossil appear in a relational tree?"" 'Our fossil of Alalcomenaeus came out with the modern chelicerates. Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages.' Less than a year ago, the same research team published the discovery of a fossilised brain in the 520 million year-old fossil Fuxianhuia protensa, showing unexpected similarity to the complex brain of a modern crustacean. 'Our new find is exciting because it shows that mandibulates - to which crustaceans belong - and chelicerates were already present as two distinct evolutionary trajectories 520 million years ago, which means their common ancestor must have existed much deeper in time,' Professor Strausfeld said. 'We expect to find fossils of animals that have persisted from more ancient times and I'm hopeful we will one day find the ancestral type of both the mandibulate and chelicerate nervous system ground patterns. They had to come from somewhere. Now the search is on.'","The fossil, discovered in China, shows the moment the ancestors of spiders and scorpions evolved from other insects .

"By . Helen Collis . PUBLISHED: . 08:13 EST, 16 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:03 EST, 16 October 2013 . A seriously-wounded Army Ranger who was thought to be unconscious has shown an astonishing act of defiance by saluting his senior as he was presented with the Purple Heart in hospital. John Hargis, from Cincinnati, Ohio, has been hailed an inspiration after his wife uploaded an image to Facebook showing him raising his arm to show respect for the higher-ranking officer. The touching moment - which his commander called the single greatest event he has witnessed in his 10 years in the Army - came after Hargis underwent surgery in a military hospital in Afghanistan. He had suffered serious leg injuries after a female suicide bomber detonated her explosives in Panjwai last week, killing four of Hargis' comrades. He was on his fourth tour of Afghanistan. Honourable: Army Ranger Josh Hargis courageously brought his right hand up to salute during a Purple Heart ceremony at his bedside in intensive care. His comrades thought he was unconscious . Days later as he lay motionless in his hospital bed in intensive care, a simple military ceremony was conducted to honour him with a Purple Heart, an award for his sacrifice to his country. But to everyone's complete surprise Hargis, who was thought to still be unconscious after the extensive surgery, raised his right hand to salute his commander. He battled a neck brace, breathing apparatus and tubes and even competed with a doctor who tried to stop him from moving to complete the mark of respect. The brave and magnanimous gesture brought tears to the eyes of the 50 grown men and soldiers who had gathered in the room to witness the ceremony. Inspiration: Josh's wife Taylor has shared the picture as it was the commander's hope that newspapers and new channels would publish it to show how he is anÂ  inspiration to the nation . The simple gesture left a lasting poignant memory for the senior officer, who wanted to share the story of Josh's honour and bravery with the world. A letter from his commmander to his wife, Taylor Hargis, explained the gravitas of the occasion. 'I cannot impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day,' he wrote in the letter, which she shared on Facebook. 'Grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about Josh's courage and character.' The commander wrote that he believes the picture, which he has hanging above his desk, belongs on every news channel and newspaper, adding he 'will remember it as the single greatest event I have witnessed in my ten years in the Army'. Suicide bomb: Josh Hargis was seriously injured in Afghanistan, pictured, when a suicide bomber detonated, killing his comrades . The ceremony was held just prior to Mr Hargis being flown back to Texas, U.S, via Germany, to receive further treatment. His mother, Laura Heitman, speaking to ABC Channel5, said her son 'sounded amazing' when he talked with WCPO. 'He was in good spirits,' she said. She told the news service her 24-year-old Dater High graduate has faced an uphill struggle to join the Army, because of a skiing accident which left him with a broken femur years ago. But he never gave up hope. she said: 'He was just very determined. He wanted so bad to be a Ranger. After three or four times, he wrote to the Surgeon General and got accepted from the Surgeon General.' She told ABC Channel 5 that they Rangers asked him to join up right after boot camp: 'It was a great honor.' Josh was seriously wounded as you know and survived for almost two hours after his injury before arriving to the hospital. Josh was immediately pushed through a series of surgeries and emerged hours later into an intensive care unit here at our base in Afghanistan. Despite being in intense pain and mental duress, Josh remained alert and compassionate to the limited Rangers that were allowed to visit him bedside. Prior to Josh being moved to Germany for his eventual flight to America, we conducted a ceremony to award him with the Purple Heart for wounds received in action. A simple ceremony, you can picture a room full of Rangers, leaders, doctors, and nurses surrounding his bedside while the Ranger Regimental Commander pinned the Purple Heart to his blanket. During the presentation the Commander publishes the official orders verbally and leaned over Josh to thank him for his sacrifice. Josh, whom everybody in the room (over 50 people) assumed to be unconscious, began to move his right arm under the blanket in a diligent effort to salute the Commander as is customary during these ceremonies. Despite his wounds, wrappings, tubes, and pain, Josh fought the doctor who was trying to restrain his right arm and rendered the most beautiful salute any person in that room had ever see. I cannot impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day. Grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about Josh's courage and character. The picture, which we believe belongs on every news channel and every news paper is attached. I have it hanging above my desk now and will remember it as the single greatest event I have witnessed in my ten years in the Army.","Josh Hargis was thought to be unconscious after undergoing surgery following severe injuries he sustained in an Afghan suicide bomb attack .

An 'excellent and caring mother' who put her three-year-old daughter on the wrong sort of booster seat was partly responsible for the horrific injuries the toddler suffered in a road smash, a court heard yesterday. Emma Williams suffered brain and spinal injuries when her mother Louise's Seat Leon was hit in August 2006. The child had been placed on a seat designed for older, taller children. A judge ruled Louise Williams was partially responsible for her daughter Emma's injuries in a car crash that was not her fault because she placed her in a seat designed for an older child (file picture) Dayne Williams, 18, was high on drink and drugs, when he swerved onto the wrong side of the road and hit Mrs Williams's car on the A528, near Wrexham. He died of his injuries. Lady Justice Black said there was no doubt the accident was entirely caused by his 'extremely dangerous' driving but said Mrs Williams bore 25 per cent responsibility for her daughter's injuries, because she had put her on a booster cushion designed for a four-year-old. The judge emphasised that Mrs Williams was in no way to blame for the smash and described her as 'an excellent and caring mother whose daughter's safety was naturally of paramount importance to her'. But she went on to rule that, although her 'conduct was similar to thousands of other parents' and no law had been broken, the mother had been negligent in not placing Emma in a five-point 'Mamas & Papas' baby harness that was also in the family car. A High Court judge ruled last year that, although the teenager driver's insurers had admitted primary liability for Emma's injuries, Mrs Williams, of Dudleston Heath, near Ellesmere, Shropshire, could not escape partial responsibility for the tragedy. Lady Justice Black, sitting at London's Appeal Court, dismissed her appeal against that ruling. She said that while Emma, at 15kg, was heavy enough for the booster cushion, she was eight centimetres too short for it. Emma was also 10 months short of her fourth birthday, the minimum age recommended by the manufacturers. Although . Emma seemed 'comfortable and secure' on the cushion, the instruction . booklet that came with it 'contained clear and repeated warnings' that a . failure to use it correctly could result in serious injury or death, . added the judge. Lady Justice Black, sitting at the Court of Appeal, described Louise Williams as an 'excellent and caring mother' Emphasising the dangers of 'premature graduation of a child from a harness seat to a booster seat or a seat belt', the judge, sitting with Lady Justice Arden and Lord Justice Elias, said the threat to Emma was 'reasonably foreseeable'. Although Mrs Williams, like so many other parents, was convinced Emma would be safe, the little girl simply 'did not fit all the requirements' for the booster cushion, concluded the judge, dismissing the mother's appeal. Graham Eklund QC, for Mrs Williams, earlier told the court she had been weaning Emma out of her baby seat as she was much more comfortable on the booster. The mother had read the instruction leaflet carefully before deciding that Emma would be safe. In the absence of Emma's father, who died before she was born, Mrs Williams had watched what other people did with their children, asked their advice and did research. 'As a result of Emma's father having died seven weeks before Emma was born, if anything Mrs Williams had been a paranoid mother, always following Emma around to ensure that she was safe,' the barrister added. 'If the decision to restrain Emma in a booster cushion reflected the state of awareness of many other parents, and was clearly a decision that many other parents would have taken, or did take, Mrs Williams could not be regarded as negligent in taking the decision that she did.' Jonathan Watt-Pringle QC, for Dayne Williams' insurers, said it was 'tragic' and 'sad' case, but pointed out that parents doing their absolute best for their children sometimes act negligently and unwittingly cause them harm. The result of Mrs Williams' appeal will have no impact on the very substantial compensation now due to Emma but means that 25 per cent of the bill must be covered by the mother's insurers.","Emma Williams suffered brain and spinal injuries in the 2006 crash .

A council has been accused of ordering CCTV 'spy' cars to hit minimum targets for issuing penalty notices - despite the practice being illegal. The alleged policy, carried out on behalf of Haringey Council in north London, was revealed in a series of leaked emails. They showed the council's CCTV cars were told to issue at least 260 fines a day - a total of 87,360 a year. The council has denied imposing a quota for fines. Tickets: Haringey Council in north London has been accused of setting targets for the number of tickets handed out by parking inspectors (file picture) Furious community leaders and traders in the Highgate Village area of the borough have called the policy 'immoral' and claim CCTV patrol cars are simply a 'money-making exercise' for the Labour-run authority. Emails sent between the council's parking manager and supervisors show that combined targets set for parking tickets issued by CCTV cars and wardens across Haringey in 2008 was 121,632. The messages were sent on April 10, 2008, just 10 days after the government issued guidelines warning that parking fine quota systems were illegal. Chairman of the Highgate Society, Kirsten de Keyser, said: 'Nobody should ever impose targets - that's appalling. It's not some kind of profit-driven business. They should never use fines and penalties to raise money. It's immoral and unethical.' Ban: The emails were allegedly sent ten days after the Government made it illegal to set targets for parking tickets (file picture) The leaked email from April 2008 said: 'The (CCTV cars) target for the year is 87,360. We are confident that we can achieve this target given that we are taking on new operators, return of a CCTV manager and the new cameras coming online.' The emails also show that local parking wardens were given a minimum target of issuing 362 parking tickets a day across the team. Another email to supervisors dated May 7, 2010, said staff were not performing to the 'average expectation' and threatens staff dismissal or a conduct hearing if improvements were not made. Immoral: Traders in the Highgate Village area of the borough say the council's CCTV cars are simply used to make money . Lee Harper, owner of Highgate Butchers, feared he would have to close his shop after his supplier was repeatedly fined as they tried to make deliveries. 'They were ticketed three times in one week and landed with a bill of Â£330 after being targeted by a CCTV smart car, run by external parking contractor On Time. 'I'm not surprised about this - it's just a money-generating exercise,' he said, 'we have to pay rates of Â£925 a month and we need to have the meat in to sell, so it's a total paradox. I'm just one guy trying to make a living.' A council spokeswoman said: 'Haringey Council does not set targets for parking penalties, and it is inaccurate to claim that we do. 'In fact, the email from 2010 clearly states that there is not a target for PCNs (penalty charge notices). The email from 2008 is now five years old. 'We did not set targets for PCNs after legislation was changed in 2008. In the case of this email, which was sent just 10 days after legislation was changed, the officer incorrectly used the term 'targets' to refer to forecasts for the anticipated number of PCNs for the following year.' She added that the forecasts are 'common practice' and designed to 'give an overview of workload for the coming year, rather than as any measure of staff performance.'","Policy allegedly carried out on behalf of Haringey Council in north London .

A motorist who killed a young bride-to-be while speeding on a country road was nicknamed 'The Stig' by friends, a court has heard. Hannah Seeley was buried in the wedding dress she never had the chance to wear, her father said. Luke Anderson was apparently driving at 81mph when he smashed into the midwife on a small road near Pakenham in Suffolk. Miss Seeley's mother Karen and her fiancÃ© Mark Wade went out to look for her after she failed to return home on April 22 last year, and came across the crash site. Crash: Hannah Seeley, left, was killed in April last year after Luke Anderson, right, collided with her . Victim: The young midwife was killed while driving home three days after buying her wedding dress . Bury St Edmunds Magistrates' Court heard that the 23-year-old's death came just three days after she bought her dress for the wedding which was scheduled to take place in September. In an emotional statement, her father revealed that she was buried in the dress and said to the killer driver, 'A wedding dress in a coffin, Luke - a wedding cross in a coffin.' Kevin Seeley, 50, spoke about how he waited until his daughter's wedding day until he saw a picture of her in her wedding dress.H . He joined his wife, Karen, 49, and Hannah's Mr Wade, 27, on a trip to see the tragic bride-to-be laid to rest in her wedding dress. But during his last goodbye, Mr Seeley put a sheet over his daughter's dress because he felt it was not right for the father-of-the-bride to see it until Hannah's wedding day. Five months later he was finally able to look at a picture of his daughter - taken at a dress fitting three days before she died. Couple: Miss Seeley was due to marry Mark Wade, right, in September, five months after her death . Tragic: The bride-to-be was buried in the wedding dress she had just bought and would never wear . The warehouse operative said: 'We . buried her in the dress because she loved it and there has been no . fall-out whatsoever about that decision. 'But the first time I actually saw the dress was on the day that she was supposed to get married. ""When I went to see her I made them . cover the dress up because the father-of-the-bride isn't supposed to see . anything like that until the wedding day.

The parents of a man left for dead by a hit-and-run driver have pleaded for help in catching the person responsible. Lee Rose, 23, was left in intensive care where his heart stopped three times during treatment following the crash in Leytonstone, east London, two weeks ago. His family, who have staged a round-the-clock vigil by his hospital bedside, revealed his horrifying injuries in a bid to trace the driver who hit him. His father Alex Dowie, 43, said the accident could easily have ended in tragedy. 'I just want them caught,' he said. 'Think if it was your own kid. How can you just drive away from something like that? It's just not right. The people responsible have got to be caught.' A Met Police spokeswoman said an investigation has been launched and that officers were hunting the driver involved. The crash happened after Mr Rose attended a party in Gants Hill with his friends on April 21. The trainee railway worker had just got off a bus in Leytonstone High Road at about 12.30am when he was hit by the dark green people carrier. The force of the impact hurled him through the air - but the vehicle sped off. A trainee nurse driving past immediately stopped to help him - giving him emergency treatment at the scene. Mr Rose suffered serious head injuries in the crash and was rushed to the Royal London Hospital. Surgeons had to remove a quarter of his shattered skull and he was repeatedly brought back to life after his heart stopped. He underwent seven hours of brain surgery after developing a blood clot. He also sustained a fractured collarbone, broken ribs and a broken hand. His mother Carol Rose, 43, who lives . with him in Hainault, Essex, said: 'The hospital phoned and said there . had been a serious accident and Lee had died at the scene and had just . died again.

'I just remember running down the road to the cab station to go and see him. It was just terrible.' Mrs Rose saluted the trainee nurse, called Laura, for stopping to help her son and said she would love to meet her to say a proper thank you. 'She brought him back to life. I would love to see this woman' she said, 'I would give her everything because if it was not for her Lee would not be here today - he would have gone.' Mrs Rose said she thought her son was going to die. 'I've been in tears all the time and it's just been one huge nightmare,' she said. 'My heart goes out to the doctors - they have been absolutely amazing.' Mr Rose's friend Matthew Daly, 23, of Hainault, was with him at the time of the crash. He said: 'There was a car driving erratically and it missed us by inches but hit Lee. We thought he was dead. 'Some of my friends tried to revive him and did mouth-to-mouth.

It is one of the worldâs most desirable cars, available only to Ferrariâs âmost loyal and passionateâ customers. So millionaire England footballer Frank Lampard must have seemed the perfect choice as a celebrity owner of the new Â£252,000 F12berlinetta. But the Italian firm was less than delighted when the car turned up on a second-hand dealershipâs website within days of its delivery â with a Â£78,000 mark-up. Lampardâs agent, Steve Kutner, says he bought the car himself at the end of last month, and that the footballerâs name appeared on the paperwork in error. However, he denies trying to make money off a quick turnaround, and claims he sold it on to someone else, who then sold it to a dealer. The F12, which accelerates to 62mph in 3.1 seconds and has been hailed as the fastest Ferrari ever, was named supercar of the year by the BBCâs Top Gear programme. Just 800 will be sold this year, of which 10 per cent will come to the UK. Mysteriously, within days of the first right-hand drive model being sold in Britain by London dealer HR Owen. It was advertised for sale as the star second-hand buy on the website of Tom Hartley, a Derbyshire-based car-dealer with a reputation for helping the super-rich jump waiting lists for the worldâs most desirable vehicles. The asking price was Â£330,000. The F12 in question was ordered in Lampardâs name using the footballerâs London address in Chelsea, which he shares with his TV host fiancee, Christine Bleakley. Lampardâs name and address were on the original invoice, delivery and registration documents. The Mail has also established that Mr Kutner arranged payment and delivery through his football management company. Sleek: The Ferrari F12berlinetta pictured on the second-hand dealership's website, was bought by Frank Lampard's agent in the footballers name . However, Mr Kutner, who was formerly . married to Sky News presenter Kay Burley, told the Mail he had placed . the order for the F12 in his own name, paid for it, and driven it away . from the dealership, insisting: âFrank knew nothing about it and has not . driven it. 'We order lots of our cars through HR Owen. They made a . mistake. I ordered the car in my name.â Another fan: Lampard's agent Steve Kutner claims he was the original buyer of the F12berlinetta . He said that after driving the Ferrari . for about 100 miles over seven days he decided he did not like it, and . sold it on to a third party. He said they, not he, sold the car to Tom Hartley. HR Owen declined to comment. A Ferrari spokesman said: âOur official dealers have identified the most loyal and passionate clients who would normally expect to receive the first cars which arrive in the market. 'Our dealers know their client base on a personal one-on-one basis, as befits a luxury premium brand like Ferrari.â Ferrari said it could not discuss its relationship with individual customers, but stressed that it was âimpossible that a dealer would make an error attributing ownership of a Â£250,000 car to a third party by mistakeâ. Mr Kutner, however, insisted that a mistake had been made. The Tom Hartley dealership refused to say who sold the F12, and how much it cost. But when pressed, boss Tom Hartley Junior admitted: âThe first owner of the car was Frank Lampard.â Lampard is a long-standing Ferrari fan. He has been seen driving many models, including the Â£175,000 458 Italia, the Â£180,000 599 GTB Fiorano, and the Â£202,000Â  Scuderia Spider 16M.

A rise in the number of stolen smart phones and tablet computers is behind the first increase in property crime for 20 years, leaked figures show. The data suggests austerity measures have led to an increase in crime, and show a rise in muggings and burglary with thieves targetting smartphones and tablets during thefts. Police have also reported an upturn in shoplifting with a number of first-time offenders arrested for stealing food such as milk, cheese and meat. Leaked figures suggest there has been a rise in muggings and burglary, with thieves targetting smartphones and tablets during thefts (posed by models) The shift in the figures is a particular trend in the north of England, with instances of reported crime in the south remaining largely constant. However, there is a fear that the pattern could spread to the rest of the country. Chief constables from across the country have now been summoned to a meeting with Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor to discuss the 'disturbing trends' in crime figures. Figures collated between April and . September show that all crimes recorded by forces in the north west of . England have risen by 2.3per cent, according to Police Professional . Magazine. Chief constables from across the country have now been summoned to a meeting with Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor, pictured, to discuss the 'disturbing trends' in crime figures . Victim based crime is up 4.3per cent in the region, which covers forces in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Lancashire, Cheshire and Cumbria, and general theft is 7.8per cent higher than it was last year. The reported figures, which were revealed at the Association of Chief Police Officers autumn conference and have not been compiled by the Office For National Statistics, also show that reports of burglary have increased by 5.3per cent, vehicle crime by 4.9per cent, and shoplifting by 10.7per cent. In Merseyside alone, shoplifting offences have risen by 17.6per cent, and theft in Manchester has gone up by 17per cent, with the figure even higher in areas of the city populated by students. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said his force has seen an increase in thefts of expensive smartphones and tablets, especially in student areas. There have been instances of concert audiences having their phones snatched as they hold them up to film the musicians, and gadgets have also been pinched from tables in coffee shops where customers can access free wifi. 'If you look at the last few months, it is definitely on the rise but it is largely acquisitive crime,' Sir Peter said at the conference. In West Yorkshire the number of overall crime reports have fallen, although the force reported an increase in acquisitive crime, such as shoplifting. Chief Constable Mark Gilmore said: 'As austerity measures take hold, people are committing offences to put money in their pockets.' Across the whole of England and Wales , victim based crime is up 0.4per cent, and general theft has increased by 1.3per cent. Over the last 20 years official crime figures have been falling, with the British Crime Survey for this year declaring that its estimate was the lowest since the study began in 1981. Official crime figures have been falling, with the British Crime Survey for this year declaring that its estimate was the lowest since the study began in 1981 . The latest survey, released in March, suggested that the total number of reported incidents was 15per cent lower than it had been in 2007/8, and less than half the highest tally recorded in 1995. According to the survey, the police recorded 3.7 million offences in the year ending June 2013, a decrease of 5per cent compared with the previous year. Steve Finnigan, Chief Constable of Lancashire and the national police representative on performance, told The Times: 'We've got to wait until we have a full year's figures, but there are some quite disturbing trends. 'Nobody is panicking but the sensible and professional thing to do is to try and understand what is the root cause of the things we've seen.' Mr Finnigan said he had been told by leading officers from across England and Wales that there was an increase in the numbers of people being arrested for stealing basic foodstuffs, such as milk and meat. Many of the first-time offenders said they had stolen simply to put food on the table. The Home Office said that crime figures had fallen both across the country as a whole and in the north west. 'We have two independent measures of crime and both show overall levels falling,' said a spokesman. 'In the North West police recorded crime has fallen by 17per cent since June 2010, while West Yorkshire has seen a drop of 15per cent in the same period. 'It is for chief constables to take all appropriate action against crime in their areas and for PCCs to ensure forces are delivering on the issues that matter to local people.'","Police report increase in shoplifting, with first-time offenders stealing food .

With its brightÂ  red front door and light and airy interior, this particular West London terrace townhouse is probably the lastÂ  place you would expect a shady spy to live. But Noâ9 Bywater Street in Chelsea is the address that author JohnÂ  le CarrÃ© picked as the home for his fictional MI6 intelligence officer, George Smiley. Over the years, Smiley â who is the central character in five le CarrÃ© novels and a minor character in three more â has been portrayed on screen by James Mason, Alec Guinness, Denholm Elliott and Gary Oldman. Hideaway: No 9 Bywater Street in Chelsea is the address John le CarrÃ© picked as the home for MI6 intelligence officer George Smiley . And the 1979 BBC series of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, starring Sir Alec Guinness, used Bywater Street itself to show Smileyâs home. Smiley is seen walking along the road and interior scenes were filmed next door to Noâ9 .ââ.ââ. at Noâ10. The current owner of Noâ9, Carolyn Aylmer, has on her mantelpiece a framed copy of a letter from former Eton master le CarrÃ© â written under his real name of David Cornwell â explaining why he chose Bywater Street. He says he knew the area because Lena Wickman, the literary scout who âspottedâ his breakthrough novel The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, lived in nearby Bramerton Street, and a âMrs Cheetam, a mother of a pupil of mine at Eton, lived in Bywater Street itselfâ. Memorabilia: The current owner of No9, Carolyn Aylmer, has on her mantlepiece a framed copy of a letter from le CarrÃ© . The letter continues: âI chose Bywater Street for Smiley because itâs a cul-de-sac, which is always a headache for watchers. âI reckoned Smiley would give himself that sort of advantage over life. The intimacy of the street made it doubly difficult for a surveillance team to escape notice.â Carolyn, who was told that she was moving into Smileyâs house only after sheâd bought it, can attest to the friendliness of the street. âSome people have been here 30 years. Thereâs a street party once a year, they close the street, and haveÂ  a paddling pool for the little ones in the afternoon. And then, when theyâve gone to bed, the wine comes out .ââ.ââ.â Carolynâs two sons have left home,Â  so she no longer needs as much space and is now selling up and moving to a nearby flat she owns. âMore than anything itâs the people Iâll miss,â she says. âItâs very arty round here â thereâs a writer, a designer, a journalist, and everyoneâs very friendly.â Originally from Guernsey, property designer Carolyn has been in the house for 18 years. âBefore I lived here, I came to London once a yearÂ  to get my hair cut and buy some clothes,â she says. âAfter my husband died, I was looking for a small flat south of the river but itâs like going into a dress shop â you get carried away! âI find itâs a very safe area; we donât have problems here. Because itâs a cul-de-sac, itâs always quiet.â But she adds that the street does attract attention â and not just because of the Smiley connection. âItâs always been a very photographed street,â she says, pointing out that, with the facades of the houses all painted different colours, it is visually striking. âYou get a lot of fashion shoots .ââ.ââ.â Carolynâs house â which has three bedrooms, two bathrooms and aÂ  west-facing garden â is for sale at Â£3.25âmillion.

Harry Potter has cast a spell over young readers after topping a poll to find the nation's favourite children's book. The boy wizard's first adventure, Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone, received the most votes in the survey by reading charity Booktrust. Some 24,000 book fans were asked to pick their favourite children's tale from a list of 100 titles, with JK Rowling's worldwide best-seller gaining more than 2,280 votes. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone topped a poll of the nation's favourite children's books, seeing off competition from sci-fi series The Hunger Games . Sci-fi adventure The Hunger Games finished second - with 1,193 votes - followed by Roald Dahl's The BFG and The Very Hungry Caterpillar, which topped a poll for readers aged five and under. Claire Shanahan, Booktrust's head of arts, said: 'As the biggest ever grossing literary franchise, kids and adults alike clearly can't get enough of Harry Potter. 'It's a worldwide phenomena - it has captured the imaginations of a generation of readers who have grown up in love with Harry or Hermione, want to be friends with Ron, and are truly terrified by Voldemort. 'Even when up against heavyweights such as Dahl and Tolkien, Rowling 's creation remains the nation's firm favourite.' The Very Hungry Caterpillar, which was first published in 1969, featured in the under-five category . Roald Dahl's The BFG was in the top 10, as was the first part of Tolkien's fantasy epic The Lord Of The Rings . Readers of all ages were asked to vote on Booktrust's website for their favourite tale to read before the age of 14. Other titles making the top 10 included AA Milne's classic Winnie The Pooh, Dr Seuss' The Cat In The Hat, JRR Tolkien's first instalment in the Lord Of The Rings series - The Fellowship Of The Ring, Charlotte's Web, Philip Pullman's novel Northern Lights, and CS Lewis's The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. The Harry Potter books have gone to sell more than 450 million copies worldwide after the Philosopher's Stone was first published in 1997. The series also launched the careers of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as the stars of the Hollywood adaptations, which along with video games, memorabilia, and theme park attractions have valued the Harry Potter franchise at 15 billion dollars (Â£9.26 billion), Booktrust said.","Harry Potter wins poll to find nation's favourite children's book .

A multi-million dollar gamble by the US Department of Energy has gone sour leaving the tab for taxpayers to cover. The Obama administration announced Friday it will lose $139 million on a loan to struggling electric car maker Fisker Automotive Inc. The company had sold part of the loan to a private investor that took the company into bankruptcy. It is one of the government's efforts to stimulate green initiatives, which has not managed to bear fruit.

Failed deal: The car company, which built this electric car, the Karma, had sold part of the loan to a private investor that took the company into bankruptcy . But Fisker failed to meet DOE benchmarks, causing it to lose its loan guarantee two years later. The company drew down on $192 million before its federal funding was pulled, and the Obama administration seized $21 million from the company in April to help repay taxpayers. The California car marker's new owner, Hybrid Technology LLC, said it plans to keep Fisker operating after it emerges from bankruptcy. In 2011, the government lost $528 million in the Solyndra collapse, triggering sharp Republican criticism of the loan program and President Barack Obama's investments in green energy. There are still plenty of nagging questions about the collapse of Solyndra, the California-based solar-panel maker that went bankrupt after getting $535 million worth of loan guarantees from the Obama administration.

The firm helped push for the stimulus bill that handed out $90 billion in green energy programs.

US spies were allowed to analyse the emails and phone records of potentially millions of Britons after being given permission by Tony Blair's Labour Government, it has been claimed. The government allowed the US National Security Agency to store information regarding Briton's landline numbers and later data regarding mobile phone and email communications and internet use. According to Channel 4 News, documents leaked by fugitive NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, show that the NSA was given the go ahead to 'unminimise' British landline telephone numbers from as early as 2004 in a 2007 agreement meaning that the agency was not required to delete the files and could analyse them. Agreement: The US National Security Agency, whose Maryland headquarters are pictured, were allowed to analyse landline phone records from 2004, according to claims by Channel 4 News . New claims: While top secret US document said it would only spy with the permission of GCHQ (pictured), another draft memo said it would analyse communications 'unilaterally' Documents from 2005 that were circulated to the UK's own intelligence service GCHQ outlines how America would target British citizens 'with the full knowledge and co-operation of GCHQ'. The NSA said that it would monitor communications in the 'best interest of the US'. But a second document, a draft memo marked 'Noforn' which means it is not for release even to British eyes, says how the NSA was prepared to spy on UK communications 'unilaterally' and without the British government's permission. Deal: The alleged agreement with US intelligence services took place while Tony Blair was Prime Minister . The two documents contain different wording and contain different circulation lists. Both the US and UK authorities have declined to comment on what happened to the draft memo. According to Channel 4 News, it could be that if a UK citizen sent a circular email to a terror suspect and everyone else in his or her contacts book, then details of everyone on that list would be monitored. The revelations appear to fly in the face of an agreement signed between the two countries in 1946 that the nations would share intelligence on foreign countries but not spy on each other. That agreement was later expanded to include five English-speaking nations and became known as the 'five-eyes' agreement. Margaret Beckett took over as Foreign Secretary in 2006 and still held the role a year later when the US and UK made the alleged agreement. Jack Straw was her predecessor. Channel 4 News attempted to contact both of them regarding the Snowden documents and both declined to comment. It is unclear whether UK intelligence services received anything in return as part of the agreement.

"By . Mark Palmer . PUBLISHED: . 20:26 EST, 7 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:25 EST, 8 November 2013 . Writer Mark Palmer was cynical when he joined a speed awareness course - but emerged a convert . 'And I hope we never get to meet again,â says John, as he puts the top back on his red marker pen and prepares to leave the room. Thereâs an uneasy silence. We get what he means, but most of us would be only too pleased to see him again, albeit in different circumstances. Weâve been in his company for the past four hours because weâve strayed from the rules of the Highway Code, and now we want to thank this shirt-sleeved saviour who has shepherded us back to the path of motoring righteousness. âThat was absolutely fascinating, John, and sobering, too,â I tell him as we shake hands by the vending machine. Certainly, my attitude is light years from how it was at 12.15pm when I walked into a dreary office building on Londonâs dreary Uxbridge Road on a dreary Tuesday. There were 24 of us gathered as our names were ticked off by a woman carrying a clipboard and a knowing expression. We had paid Â£97 each to attend one of the AAâs Speed Awareness Courses, a relatively small sum compared with the prospects of an âSP20â endorsement and three points on our licence. In my case that would have meant a tally of 12 and six months or so on the buses. All my points have been for speeding. On this occasion I had been doing 38mph in a 30mph limit, hardly criminal I told myself, as we shuffled into the room. Then, to my horror, I found myself sitting slap bang in the middle of the front row. At the very least, my idea had been to spend the afternoon doodling at the back of the class or writing my Christmas card list. I glanced at my fellow naughty speeders. Some attendees on the course, led by a tutor named John, did not know the national speed limit of 60mph . We were a cosmopolitan bunch of all ages. One woman arrived with her weekly Sainsburyâs shop. The man across the aisle from me was wearing a thick coat and bobble hat which he kept on throughout the session despite it being an overheated room. Some of us had taken our driving tests only a few years ago; others, like me, have been behind the wheel four decades or more, during which the rules of the road have changed somewhat âÂ  as I was about to discover. âMy nameâs John and I am not a policeman,â he began. âNow letâs face it, you donât really want to be here but letâs all try to get on and, who knows, you might find some of it interesting.â Shortly after the off, he asked us to jot down the speed limits for urban areas, rural single carriageways, dual carriageways and motorways. I was sure the country roads limit was 70mph. I always understood the round white signs with a black diagonal line through them that you see on leaving a village mean you can go pretty much as fast as you like. More than half of the 1,754 people who died on the roads last year were driving on rural roads . The correct answer was 60mph. Hardly anyone scored top marks. âPerhaps we should re-read the Highway Code from time to time,â said John. âJust a thought.â John was never patronising or judgmental, always polite and good-humoured. He told us that if a pedestrian is hit at 20mph the survival rate is almost 98âper cent, whereas if they are hit at 40mph the chances of survival drop to just 10âper cent. Writer Mark Palmer: 'I no longer think of speed cameras as cash dispensers for local authorities' He then ventured that if he were Transport Secretary he would be keen for all drivers to attend a speed awareness course every ten years or so as a ârefresherâ. âIâd vote for you,â said a woman by the window. âMe, too,â said a self-confessed White Van Man. I would go further. Learner drivers should have to attend one of these classes before taking their tests, and fines for speeding should be far higher than for a parking ticket. There is no excuse for speeding, just as there is no excuse for texting at the wheel. Oh yes, Iâm filled with the zeal and intolerance of the newly converted. I have been a speedy driver most of my life â but not because I get a thrill from it. I speed because I am impatient and am often running late. I speed because my main thoughts when driving are about myself rather than the safety of anyone else. John hasnât just cut my speed, heâs also increased my awareness of others. Yesterday, as my wife entered a 40mph zone in Norfolk, I suggested she should drive in either second or third gear so that the noise of the engine would remind her of the limit â a tip John had passed on. And, then, when she was preparing to turn right off a single lane across traffic I said she should not turn the wheels until she knew it was safe to make the manoeuvre. As John had pointed out, âif you do and someone shunts you from behind then youâll end up being pushed into the oncoming trafficâ. Last year, 1,754 people died on the roads, the lowest figure since records began in 1926. Sixty per cent of those died in accidents on rural roads, 34âper cent in towns and villages and only 6âper cent on motorways. With the help of Powerpoint slides, still photography and live footage of cars braking at various speeds, John was winning over his audience. Toot-toot! Mark Palmer was more like Mr Toad from Wind in the Willows, played here by Matt Lucas . He didnât go out of his way to shock â although there was an audible gasp when he showed a crushed childâs bike under the wheel of a car following an accident in Finchley, North London. âWhat happened to the child?â asked a woman near the back. âShe died, Iâm afraid.â âOh...â said the woman, her voice breaking. âI have a young daughter and Iâm finding this uncomfortable. Can we move on?â There were several more gasps when we saw a detailed reconstruction of the worst motorway crash ever in Britain. It involved 51 vehicles on the eastbound carriageway of the M4 near junction 14 in March 1991. No one was speeding, but several cars were going far too fast in the dense fog. Ten died and more than 25 were injured. Such was the carnage that the M4 was closed for four days while the wreckage was removed and the road repaved. What has amazed me since last week is how I no longer see speed cameras as the enemy. And I no longer think of them as cash dispensers for local authorities trying to balance the books. âHow many speed cameras are there in London within the M25?â John had asked us. âAbout 5,000,â I said. âNo, more than that,â said the Sainsburyâs shopper. âThe answer is 692, actually, and only about a quarter of those will be active at any one time,â said John, who went on to explain the strict criteria that allows a camera to be installed in the first place. Top of the list is that three people need to have been killed or seriously injured within half a mile of the allotted stretch of road in a 36-month period. In addition, 20âper cent of vehicles have to be travelling at above the speed limit for 28 consecutive days. Some crashes, such as this one on the Sheppey Crossing in Kent in September, are caused by drivers not paying enough attention to weather conditions such as fog. Another such crash on the M4 in 1991 killed 10 . What this means is that a speed camera immediately tells you there has been a history of accidents, possibly some fatal. You can rail against them all you want, but youâll never feel the pain as much as the mother or father, wife or husband of those who have died as a result of someone going too fast. Frankly, it appalls me that my son, who passed his test last month and who has inherited the impatience of his father, is driving around without attending one of these courses. And itâs ludicrous that new drivers can pass their tests without ever driving on a motorway. This week, the Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said that driving tests should have a distinction grade â rather than just a pass or a fail â to improve road safety because insurers would offer cheaper premiums to those who pass with flying colours. This seems to me an excellent idea. I also welcome the news that the Government is considering raising the driving age to 18 from 17. Just as drink driving and the whole notion of âone for the roadâ is now regarded as indefensible, so, too, speeding should be seen as beyond the pale in a civilised society.

A driver caught doing 130mph with a cup of tea between hisÂ  legs told a court he had beenÂ  surprised to find the expensive Mercedes he was driving did not have a cup holder. Andrew Howie, who owns an organic milkshake company, was travelling home after dropping his brother at the airport for an early morning flight. The 35-year-old bought a cup of tea but ended up holding it between his legs after he found there was nowhere to put it in his motherâs E-class Mercedes, which he was borrowing. Appearing at Colchester Magistratesâ Court, Howie said he had been surprised to realise there was no cup holder in the car, which can cost between Â£32,750 and Â£74,095.

Howie had taken his brother to Stansted airport on May 27 and was on his way home to Tiptree, near Colchester, Essex, when he stopped to buy a cup of tea at a McDonaldâs. He drank most of it while in the car park, but then set off home with some of the drink remaining. At around 4am, police clocked him driving at nearly twice the speed limit. Officers pulled him over and found he had the cup of tea between his legs.

A 16-year-old died Saturday during an Atlanta-bound flight to visit his military veteran father for Christmas. The teen boy, who suffered from cerebral palsy, went into cardiac after a medical emergency 30 minutes after take-off from Seattle, Spokane Fire Department spokesperson Brian Schaeffer told MailOnline. The boy was flying with his mother, grandmother and another sibling to visit his father stationed at McChord Air Force Base but was outside Atlanta for unknown reasons, according to Mr Schaeffer. On the ground: Emergency personnel with the Tacoma Fire Department race to the plane to try to save the boy's life . The boy and his family were flying to Atlanta to spend time with his father for the Christmas holiday when he went into cardiac arrest, Mr Schaeffer explained. âThe majority of the family went on the plane to fly down to Georgia this afternoon,â he added. There is no indication as to why the unidentified boy had the medical emergency, but passenger Joe Ryan, of Atlanta, told MailOnline the flight crew notified people on-board the boy had cerebral palsy. Washington State patient-confidentiality rules prohibit local officials from divulging such information outside of a coronerâs report, said Mr Schaeffer, but he did say there was nothing in his medical history to suggest such an incident was to be expected. 'It was an expected event by any means,' he said. The boy and his family were sitting at the back of the plane when they began calling for help, said Mr Ryan. The flight crew immediately sprung into action. Despite the dire circumstances, everyone â including passengers â remained calm and collected through out. âIt was calm and the male flight attendants rushed to his aid at the back of the plane,â said Mr Ryan. âThey started performing CPR on himâ¦ the pilot got on the air and said we are going to have an emergency landing.â âWe were on the ground in five minutes... I think that they did everything they could to save that boyâs life,' Mr Ryan added.

An adviser to the Leveson Inquiry has broken ranks to reject one of its most contentious conclusions: that police should keep secret arrests of criminal suspects. Shami Chakrabarti said that although it was wrong for the police to brief against suspects to âpressure or punishâ, it was âequally chillingâ for officers to refuse to name someone they have detained or charged. She also condemned a âblanket policy of arresting people in secretâ. Outspoken: Shami Chakrabarti rejected one of Leveson's key conclusions that police should keep secret arrests of criminal suspects . Findings: Lord Justice Leveson's report into Press standards concluded that unless some exceptional circumstance applied, 'the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the Press or public' Lord Justice Levesonâs report into Press standards concluded that unless some exceptional circumstance applied, âthe names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the Press or publicâ. But yesterday Miss Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, the civil liberties and human rights campaign group, said: âPolice briefing against arrested individuals to pressure or punish is clearly abusive but itâs equally chilling for officers to refuse to confirm names of those detained or charged. âAggressively volunteering suspectsâ identities is one thing, a blanket policy of arresting people in secret, without the knowledge of Press and public, is quite another. âClearer guidance to forces is plainly required but all the rules and policies in the world are no substitute for a deeper understanding of the sensitive use of discretion to protect the public including vulnerable suspects.â Her comments will fuel the growing backlash against police plans for draconian restrictions on what information they release. Within weeks, senior officers will publish new rules barring forces from identifying anyone who has been arrested, which has horrified free speech campaigners. Yesterday a Daily Mail survey revealed that 14 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales are keeping secret the names of suspects even after they have been charged. Publicity: On Thursday it emerged that BBC sexual predator Stuart Hall might never have been brought to justice under the proposed new secrecy regime . Fears over the influence of Leveson on police secrecy were raised on Wednesday when oneÂ  force announced it would no longer name suspects it had charged with a criminal offence. The Warwickshire force made the announcement in a footnote to a Press release revealing that one of its own former officers had been charged with stealing more than Â£100,000. On Thursday the force reversed its position. Secret sentence: The Daily Mail revealed the case of Wanda Maddocks, who was imprisoned for five months for contempt after trying to get her 80-year-old father John out of a care home where his family believed he was in danger . Critics say secret arrests are the hallmark of authoritarian countries. On Thursday it emerged that BBC sexual predator Stuart Hall might never have been brought to justice under the proposed new secrecy regime. Publicity surrounding his arrest in December led to more than a dozen other victims coming forward. If they had not added their complaints, the case might have collapsed for lack of evidence. After his arrest, Hall, 83, declared his innocence and invoked Leveson to complain about âsystematic leaks to the mediaâ. The countryâs most senior judge yesterday instructed his colleagues that they must never again send anybody to prison in secret. Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, said it was a âfundamental principleâ that people jailed for contempt of court should be sentenced in public. He warned judges: âThis is mandatory. There are no exceptionsâ. The âimportant guidanceâ from Lord Judge â backed by the chief family courts judge Sir James Munby â came ten days after the Daily Mail revealed the case of Wanda Maddocks, who was imprisoned for five months for contempt after trying to get her 80-year-old father John out of a care home where his family believed he was in danger. The hearing of the Court of Protection at which Miss Maddocks, 50, was sentenced was effectively secret.","Shami Chakrabarti condemned a 'blanket policy' of secret arrests .

It's a perfect reason to crack open the champagne â new researchÂ  suggests three glasses of bubbly a week can improve your memory. Scientists are convinced a regular tipple of champagne can helpÂ  prevent brain disorders such as dementia and Alzheimerâs disease. Connoisseurs have long argued its benefits. Barrister and crime writer Sir John Mortimer drank a glass of champagne every morning and said it was the secret to a long life. He died aged 85. Cheers: Scientists believe a little champagne may be good for you . But the study at Reading University is the first time scientists have identified health benefits in champagne. In Britain â where one in three over-65s develops dementia â it could be revolutionary. The compound that helps stave off forgetfulness has been found in the black grapes, Pinot noir and Pinot meunier, used for champagne. Jeremy Spencer, a biochemistry professor who led the research, said: âThese grapes are used in red wine and lots of research has been done on the health benefits of red wine, so I was curious to find out if there were any health attributes in champagne.â Red wine, if consumed modestly, has been found to help lower blood pressure and protect the heart. This is due to the compound chemicals in vines known as flavonoids. The memory aid found in champagne, however, is a different compound, phenolic acid. The study at Reading University is the first time scientists have identified health benefits in champagne . Prof Spencer suggested anyone over 40 would be wise to drink two or three glasses of bubbly a week. He said: âDementia probably starts in the 40s and goes on to the 80s. It is a gradual decline and so the earlier people take these beneficial compounds in champagne, the better.â About 80 per cent of all champagne is made from the two black grape varieties blended with a white Chardonnay grape. Researchers found that after champagne was consumed there was a significant boost toÂ  spatial memory â the ability to recognise surroundings that enables people to find their way home. The experiments were conducted on rats but Prof Spencer is confident there would be a similar impact on the human brain. The rats were given champagne daily with it mixed in their feed like a mash for six weeks. Each rat was allowed to run in a maze to find an edible treat. Five minutes later, the exercise was repeated to see if the rat had remembered where it had retrieved the original treat and where it could find another. Without champagne, the rats had a 50 per cent success rate, but after a tipple their score shot up to an average 70 per cent. Biopsy tests measured proteins which are important for short-term memory. Prof Spencer said: âThe results were dramatic. After rats consumed champagne regularly, there was a 200 per cent increase of proteins important for determining effective memory. This occurred in rats after just six weeks. We think it would take about three years in humans. âThis research is exciting because it illustrates for the first time that moderate consumption of champagne has the potential to influence cognitive functioning such as memory.â He is now hoping to conduct a trial on about 50 or 60 people aged over 65 who will be asked to drink champagne for three years. A spokesman for the Alzheimerâs Society said: âThis is an interesting study, especially for those who enjoy a glass of bubbly. However, people should not start celebrating just yet. This is the first time a link between champagne and dementia risk reduction has been found. A lot more research is needed.â","Study at Reading University finds health benefits in champagne .

A Las Vegas woman on trial for directing her brother and son to murder her estranged husband was described Wednesday as a 'scorned woman' who wanted to cash in on the man's $250,000 insurance policy. In the first day of her attempted murder and conspiracy trial, prosecutors said Amy Bessey planned the November 2012 hit on husband, Robert Bessey, just days before their divorce finalized so she could access the pile of cash, and hopefully his social security benefits too. The 43-year-old had also allegedly started a romantic relationship with her biological son, Michael Bessey, 21, whom her ex-husband adopted as a child, and this is believed to be another reason she wanted him out of the way. Scroll down for video . Planned: Prosecutors said Amy Bessey, 43, pictured in court on Wednesday, planned the November 2012 hit on husband, Robert Bessey, just days before their divorce finalized . Victim: Richard Bessey, pictured in court, survived the attempt on his life and testified in his ex-wife's trial . 'A famous saying was repeated that hell hath no fury as a woman scorned, and the evidence in this case, is going to show that the defendant, Amy Bessey is that woman scorned,' prosecutor Sam Martinez said, according to ABC News. Bessey faces up to 91 years in prison if she's convicted of the eight charges against her, which include attempted murder and conspiracy. She has pleaded not guilty in the case. In the Las Vegas justice court, Martinez read out a text message her brother, Richard Pearson, 39, sent her prior to the assassination attempt, which said, 'I love it when a plan comes together.' Accused: Amy Bessey, 42, allegedly plotted to kill her husband for his life insurance policy . 'That ladies and gentlemen is a text . message sent by Ric Pearson to his sister, the defendant, Amy Bessey, . approximately six hours prior to Robert Bessey being shot in the head,' Martinez told jurors. Bessey survived the attempt on his life and testified in his ex-wife's trial. He said he was driving his usual route to work at 4:35 a.m. November 14 when a gunshot came from a gold SUV. 'I felt a hot sensation here and towards the back of my neck. I start feeling what I believe to be a bullet,' Bessey told the court. 'This is my sweatshirt. You can see the hole in the neck.' The couple had been married for 18 years and had three kids together. They each had two children from prior relationships and Bessey adopted Amy Bessey's biological son Michael two years after they were married. Robert Bessey also testified Wednesday that Michael had been pulling away from him to be closer to his wife after he returned from the military months before the shooting. Bessey said Michael's move back into the home after he was dishonorably discharged caused friction between him and his wife. He said he noticed Michael's relationship with his mother had changed. 'They seemed to be closer or adult conversation, rather than mother-son,' Bessey testified. Prosecutors also showed the court gas station surveillance video that captured Bessey's brother and son not far from the scene of the shooting in a gold SUV that police say was tied to the incident. Police said the shooting followed another attempt at Robert Bessey's life, which involved a family friend. According to documents seen by Fox 5 News, the friend, Courtney Smith, gave Robert Bessey a Red Bull energy drink laced with arsenic in June 2012. Documents said Amy Pearson paid Smith $50,000 in the plot.

"By . Rachel Rounds . PUBLISHED: . 16:20 EST, 16 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:22 EST, 16 October 2013 . This morning I woke up alone again, as I do every morning. I nipped down to the kitchen to make a plate of hot buttered toast and brought it back to bed, where I switched on the radio, lay back and tucked in, happily scattering crumbs all over the sheets. My husband Tom and I hadn't had an argument, nor is our sex life a thing of the past. Quite the reverse. Ever since my husband and I decided to sleep in separate bedrooms five years ago, our marriage has been happier and more fulfilling than ever. 'Best thing I ever did': Rachel is highly pleased with the restorative effects sleeping in a separate bedroom to her husband has had . As I listened to Tom's footsteps in the hallway, I smiled mischievously as I recalled our wonderful 'date' in his bedroom yesterday evening, which ended with a kiss goodnight before I tiptoed back to my own boudoir. I've always believed that deciding to sleep alone was the best thing I ever did. And this week I learned that I am in some very good royal company. In an interview, Princess Michael of Kent revealed that she and her husband sleep in separate bedrooms so they are 'fresher' for each other. Since they've been married for 35 years, they're clearly doing something right. Sharing a marital bed is a peculiarly British thing. Continentals are far less keen, and America's National Association of Home Builders says 60 per cent of new homes are likely to have dual master bedrooms by 2015. So why do it? Well, please understand, I love my husband dearly and the physical attraction between us remains as strong as the day we met. But between his snoring and my fidgeting, we just could not get along while we were sharing a duvet. Tom and I met in 2001 when I was a political correspondent for GMTV and he worked at the Ministry of Defence. Reinvigorated relationship: Rachel, pictured here with Tom at their wedding, thinks their marriage is happier and more fulfilling than ever . Although he's 23 years older than me, I fell for him instantly. Born in Fiji, he joined the RAF at 17, flew all over the world and fought in two wars - a definite Alpha male, with dark skin, a deep voice and one infuriating habit. Like 40 per cent of the men in this country, Tom snores - very loudly, every night, without fail. Only last week, a survey revealed that more than half of all couples find snoring the most annoying habit in bed, and one in ten of us would rather sleep with a pet than our partner. For me, sleepless nights became a fact of life. But Tom was so lovely in every other way that I felt compelled to try to turn a deaf ear to a habit he couldn't really help. This went on for four years until 2005 when Tom and I separated. He already had three children from his first marriage and, at 57, was adamant he didn't want to start another family. I desperately wanted a child, so we split. We were apart for just over one miserable year before Tom managed to woo me back with the promise that we would marry and start a family. I was delighted - but I didn't feel the same way about his snoring. Our first few weeks back together were heaven by day, hell-on-earth by night. 'Night after glorious night, I go to sleep and stay asleep.' Ear plugs, anti-snoring sprays and nasal strips made zero impact. So I made Tom consult his doctor, who told him that his sonorous habit was thanks to some boxing he had done as a young man that had left him with a deviated septum. On the basis that it would be painful and might not even work, he firmly declined the suggested surgery - and my thoughts turned murderous. On a short break to Spain soon afterwards, things became so bad that I woke Tom and yelled at him: 'If you don't stop snoring, I am going to punch you really, really hard. Please go and sleep in the bathroom.' Tom argued that since I was the only person affected, I was the one who should sleep in the bathroom. And so it was that I took myself off to a cold, tiled floor, next to a dripping tap, too exhausted to fight any longer. Once we got home, I just told Tom straight: 'I want to sleep in the spare room.' Much to my amazement, he greeted the idea warmly. 'Thank goodness for that!' he said. 'I had been trying to think of a way to tell you that your fidgeting and getting up to the loo so many times in the night is driving me insane.' Good night's sleep: Now Rachel doesn't have to be pestered by Tom's annoying nocturnal habits . And so, five years ago, I moved into the spare room. I go to bed early with a hot-water bottle (even in summer, as I have the coldest feet) and read a book. I eat chocolate and crisps in bed and get crumbs everywhere - a habit Tom can't stand. Night after glorious night, I go to sleep and stay asleep. By contrast Tom goes to bed very late and watches television with the windows open, even in winter. Friends say we're missing out on those spontaneous moments of intimacy and early-morning cuddles. But, in reality, people wake up with morning breath and flatulence, not in a romantic embrace. Intimacy may feel like it's 'on tap' when you share the same bed, but in my experience, couples who know they can do it any time actually end up doing it very little. But when you have separate beds, you make time for each other out of desire, not out of habit. After our son, Tanoa, was born in September 2012, he slept in my room because I was breastfeeding. Now, each night Tom and I take turns to have the baby monitor in our room and get up if he wakes. Since he has slept 11 hours a night since he was six months old, that's never been an issue. In fact, our sleeping arrangements are so stress-free all round, that I have been recommending it as a foolproof way of reinvigorating a relationship. After all, there's not much that can't be improved by the restorative power of a really good night's sleep.","Rachel was unable to sleep because of her husband's deafening snore .

State benefits should be fixed by law so no Government can cut them, former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Williams said yesterday. He said welfare handouts should be âring-fencedâ so claimants would not have to worry about losing them or seeing them reduced. And he called for benefits to be renamed to try to stop people criticising them. Lord Williams, who stepped down from Lambeth Palace earlier this year, said that âwelfare has become a loaded wordâ and proposed that state benefits should in future be known as âsocial shareâ. The idea of permanently guaranteed benefits, with a new name to make them more popular, came in an article in which Lord Williams condemned levels of poverty in Britain. He attacked âthe scandalous and lethal inequalities of our societyâ. Lord Williams also described Britain as âa society with corrupt governance and low accountabilityâ. Lord Williams intervened in the continuing political row over benefits in a book of essays, published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, dedicated to the idea that poverty can be eradicated. The former archbishop said fixing state benefits was part of the answer, adding that the amount spent on welfare was âa neuralgic point in a climate of austerity, but an essential oneâ. Welfare, Lord Williams said, is now a word which invites criticism of the scale of state benefits. He added: âPerhaps we need a new vocabulary â not welfare payments but a âsocial shareâ.â The former archbishop said poverty was not about lack of wealth but a matter of peopleâs vulnerability â those who do not have dependable accommodation, for example.

More than half of people who saw George Osborneâs Autumn Statement think it was bad for them, a new poll reveals. In a blow for the Chancellor who unveiled a raft of populist giveaways, 60 per cent thought it was good for ârich peopleâ. It comes after warnings from the official economic watchdog that despite better than expected growth figures, forecasts for rises in wages have been slashed for the next five years. More than half of people who saw the Autumn Statement thought it would be bad for poor people and 'people like me', an IpsosMORI survey has found . George Osborne visited a JCB factory the morning after his Autumn Statement, where he met with JCB Chairman Lord Bamford . Mr Osborne used his yesterdayâs Autumn Statement to unveil a raft of upbeat data pointing to the recovery gaining momentum, with record numbers in work, borrowing falling and house prices forecast to soar by 5.2 per cent next year. The economy is forecast to grow by 1.4 per cent this year, up from just 0.6 per cent forecast in March. The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts a dramatic increase in house prices, up 3.2 per cent this year, 5.2 per cent next year and an eye-watering 7.2 per cent in 2015. But it also downgraded forecasts for wage rises, with average earnings in 2013 now expected to grow by 1.5 per cent compared to 2.1 per cent predicted in March. It found that wages will be outstripped by the RPI rate of inflation which tracks rises in prices for years to come. Labour's Ed Balls made a terrible speech in the Commons, but his message o the economic appears to be resonating with voters . Voters think Mr Osborne's plans will help the economy but damage public services . Battle: Chancellor George Osborne clashed with . Labour's Ed Balls over figures showing growth is up, but ordinary people . are not feeling the benefits . George Osborne has said the UK must recapture the âpioneering spiritâ of the industrial revolution if it is to secure firm long-term growth out of the fledgling recovery. The Chancellor said it was crucial the mistakes of the recent past - with over-reliance on particular sectors and areas of the UK - were not repeated but there were lessons to be taken from the country's history. He was touring digger builder JCB's factory in Staffordshire off the back of the company's Â£150 million investment announcement to expand and create new jobs. He said the Government was committed to investment in young people and apprenticeships to tackle youth unemployment, and on taking the âdifficult decisionsâ building big new infrastructure projects like new roads, and the High Speed 2 north-south rail link (HS2). He added: âHundreds of years ago our country was prepared to invest in railways and other big projects - our country needs that pioneering spirit again.â Average earnings will be below RPI until 2015, the year of the general election, when both are expected to rise by 3.3 per cent. It . means that people will not start to feel better off until 2016, and . means that real wages will have fallen by 5.8 per cent in real terms . from 2010 to 2015. A snap poll of voters by IpsosMORI . after Mr Osborne delivered his statement reveals public unease about . feeling the benefit of the recovery. More . than half of people surveyed (56 per cent) say they watched the . statement or heard about it on the TV or radio or read it online. Of . those who had seen it, 60 per cent said it was good for ârich peopleâ, . 55 per cent said it was bad for âpoor peopleâ and 51 per cent thought it . was bad for âpeople like meâ. Mr . Osborne clashed angrily with Labourâs shadow chancellor Ed Balls in the . Commons, with Mr Balls considered to have put in a dire performance . after his grim warnings of the impacts of austerity were proved wrong by . the latest figures. Mr Balls turned red in the face as he struggled to be heard against a wall of noise from Tory MPs. Mr . Balls was greeted with a roar of derision from across the House when he . claimed that it was the Chancellor who was âin complete denialâ about . the state of the economy. But the poll reveals voters think Mr Balls called it right, even if he left some Labour insiders despairing with his delivery. The . poll asked which politicianÂ  voters agreed with most: âEd Balls who . says George Osborne is in denial about the cost of living crisisâ or . âGeorge Osborne who says his long-term plan for economic recovery is . workingâ. Some 40 per cent agreed with Mr Balls, while only 24 per agree with Mr Osborne. Gideon Skinner, head of political . research at Ipsos MORI, said: âThe Conservatives have seen their ratings . on managing the economy rise in line with general optimism about the . economy. âHowever, many . people also feel that the growth in the economy is not benefiting their . own standard of living, and this is reflected in the finding that 40 per . cent agree with Ed Balls that George Osborne is in denial about the . cost of living crisis. âBut . these are peopleâs initial reactions â there is still time for them to . change as they digest the Autumn Statement - and in particular the . mediaâs interpretation of it.â Official forecasts by the Office for Budget responsibility show how wage rises will be outstripped by increases in living costs . In the Commons yesterday the Chancellor said he wanted to secure a 'responsible recovery to allow the Government to live within its means'. By 2018 the government is on course to have stopped borrowing money and even post a surplus. It is a dramatic about-turn from the . Budget in March, when the Office for Budget Responsibility slashed . growth forecasts and warned there would be no new jobs this year. The OBR said 400,000 more jobs would be . created in 2013, and unemployment forecast to fall from 7.6 per cent . this year to 7 per cent in 2015, and 5.6 per by 2018. Most strikingly it now expects the UK economy to grow by 1.4 per cent this year, up from 0.6 per cent it predicted in March. It is the highest in-year increase since 1999 and makes the British economy the second fastest growing in the developed world. The . OBR said government spending as a percentage of GDP will fall from 23.2 . per cent in 2009 to just 16.1 per cent in 2018-19, âthe lowest on . record going back to 1948â. To . loud cheers in the Commons, Mr Osborne said: 'This country is working . through its long term plan, bringing down the deficit and dealing with . the debt. Spending less on welfare and making the big decisions on . infrastructure. 'Living within our means and cutting tax on business. Making work pay and letting people keep more of what they earn. 'Confidence . in the next generation, as they make their way in education and in the . workplace. This statement shows the plan is working. Itâs a serious plan . for a grown up country. 'But . the job is not done. By doing the right thing, weâre heading in the . right direction. Britainâs moving again... letâs keep going.' Mr . Osborne took aim at Labour's claim that it was a 'fantasy' that the . private sector could create more jobs than those lost in the public . sector. 'Businesses have . already created three jobs for every one lost in the public sector and . the OBR report forecasts this will continue with 3.1million more jobs . being created by businesses by 2019, more than offsets the one million . or so reduction in the public sector.' George Osborne uses a stud gun during his visit to JCB's backhoe loader . Chancellor George Osborne may have difficulty in making his Budget sums add up, a leading economic think-tank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said he was relying on 'uncertain' revenues from a crackdown on tax avoidance and an increase in the bank levy to fund a series of giveaways in his Autumn Statement yesterday. Mr Osborne told MPs that the measures he had set out were ""fiscally neutral"" - leaving the overall level of projected Government spending unchanged. However, IFS director Paul Johnson said the Chancellor's cuts in fuel duty, employers' National Insurance contributions and business rates, and his introduction of a tax break for married couples would cost the Exchequer around Â£2.5 billion a year. The increase in the bank levy is only expected to raise around Â£500,000, while the new anti-avoidance measures are slated to bring in an 'inevitably uncertain' Â£1 billion - leaving a Â£1 billion shortfall. At the same time, the Treasury is assuming that the Â£750 million a year cost of the Liberal Demorcats' free school meals for five- to seven-year olds will be swallowed up into the 'overall spending envelope' from 2016-17 - which would mean even deeper cuts in other spending. 'The Chancellor continues to make specific promises on spending increases whilst stating that he will keep total spending at the same level. He can't keep doing that,' Mr Johnson said. 'Whilst the costs of his tax cuts are pretty definite, the benefits from his anti-avoidance measures, and indeed of the increase in the bank levy, are rather less certain.'","Snap poll of people who saw Autumn Statement reveals fears of voters .

Confidence is rising among UK firms and job vacancies are growing at their fastest rate since 1998, reports published today claim. They give another boost to Chancellor George Osborne with more evidence that the recovery is taking hold. One survey on the jobs market . found that the demand from companies for new staff is increasing faster . than at any time in the past 15 years. Recovery: Although millions are still out of work, reports published today suggest demand for workers is rising . The growth in salaries for those taken on in permanent positions is at a six-year high, because fewer good candidates are on the market. Demand for new staff was much stronger in the wealth-creating private sector than in the public sector, according to a survey by accountancy firm KPMG and the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC). Recruitment & Employment Confederation chief executive Kevin Green, pictured, said 'all regions' in Britain are in growth . The greatest demand for new permanent . staff was in the Midlands, indicating the economic revival is not . confined to London and the South East. Engineering showed the strongest growth among the professions, suggesting a pick-up in Britainâs manufacturing industry. Kevin Green, chief executive of REC, said . the report showed âall sectors, all regions and both the private and . public sector are in growth, which is fantastic news for British . businesses, the UK economy and people looking for work in 2014â. A separate report by accountants BDO found that firmsâ confidence levels rose to a three and a half year high in November. Its âOptmism Indexâ rose to 103.1 last . month, from 101.7 in October and just 91.4 in November 2012. A figure . above 100 shows that firms think growth will be better than the long run . average, while a reading of less than 100 indicates they are . pessimistic and believe it will be below the trend. âThis is a strong and broad-based recoveryâ, said Peter Hemington, a partner at BDO. âI think we can finally say that the key economic battleground has . shifted from austerity to the new debate about how the government can . help UK businesses achieve sustained growth in the context of a dynamic, . internationally competitive economy.â Relief: The reports will be welcome news to the Chancellor George Osborne, pictured on Friday visiting a JCB factory in Rocester, Staffordshire. His Autumn Statement was adamant that the recovery is well under way . The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said last week that more than one million jobs will be created in the next five years, with the number in work reaching a record 31.2 million in 2018. Unemployment is set to fall from the current rate of 7.6 per cent to 7 per cent in 2015 and 5.6 per cent in 2018. The OBR more than doubled its growth forecast for 2013 from 0.6 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for 2014 from 1.8 per cent to 2.4 per cent. That allowed the Chancellor to boast that Britain is now growing faster than any major developed economy, with job creation in the private sector more than making up for losses in the taxpayer-funded public sector. Research by Lloyds Bank also published today found business activity is strong across all regions of England.","Vacancies opening up in the private sector with a shortage of skilled staff .

'We fight tenaciously where we think thereâs a danger of the Government lurching off in the wrong direction.â Asked whether he would be prepared to serve under the present Mayor of London if he ever became Tory prime minister, Mr Clegg told the Sunday Telegraph: âYes, of course. âI want my party to punch above its weight, and indeed we do.â Last week Mr Clegg and Mr Johnson . clashed after the London mayor made controversial comments on the . subject of IQ, suggesting that much of the âspeciesâ are too stupid to . ever get on in life. Clegg (centre) said he wants his party to remain in government after 2015 whether it be in partnership with Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) or the Conservative leader David Cameron (right) But the Deputy Prime Minister said he would be prepared to work under him. Mr Clegg said his party would be happy to work with Labour, but it would need a more mature approach on the economy - such as an insistence that the deficit is eliminated. âWhat I was trying to do, beyond the individual measures, was say to Labour: âLook, we may have our differences, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but we both agree that you have to clear the decks by 2018. Whatâs your point of view?â.â It comes amid reports that Mr Clegg is preparing to unleash a wave of speeches distancing himself from David Cameron and the Tories. A party source said yesterday that the Lib Dems could soon start to indulge in âgentle flirtingâ with Labour. Danny Alexander said the Conservatives could not 'be trusted to deliver fairness in this country' âWeâll be seeing a growing number of speeches highlighting our differences,â said the insider. âWeâve said a lot about what we have achieved in Coalition. From now on weâll be focusing on what we could do apart.â The Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, told the BBCâs Andrew Marr Show that the Lib Dems and Tories were different. âIâd say that there are big differences between our parties; we want to have both a strong economy and a fair society, we think that you need the Liberal Democrats to keep the country in the centre-ground so you can have both,â he said. âLabour, as we saw this week from Ed Balls, couldnât deliver a stronger economy, thatâs why no on trusts them on the economy. But I donât think the Conservatives by themselves could be trusted to deliver fairness in this country either.â","Clegg said coalitions 'here to stay' as grip of two main parties slackens .

A top economist says Labour leader Ed Miliband's plan to cap energy bills will cripple the UK's energy infrastructure . Ed Milibandâs pledge to freeze energy prices has been savaged by the leader of the worldâs most influential economic group. Angel Gurria, of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says it will destroy investment in the energy infrastructure needed to keep the lights on. Mr Miliband said in September that he will freeze energy prices for 20 months if Labour wins the general election in 2015. The commitment is credited with keeping his party high in the opinion polls, although new research claims it has wiped billions off the value of shares in energy firms. But Mr Gurria says a freeze on bills takes no account of the fluctuating international cost of energy. In an interview with BBC Panorama tonight, he says some energy firms could be left bankrupt by the plan, which would deter investors just when Britain needs more energy infrastructure. He adds: âIf you freeze the price of energy and the international price of energy rises it means thereâs going to be a very big difference to pay. Whoâs going to pay the difference? Are you going to ask the investors to take the difference? âTheyâll probably go bankrupt. How are you going to get people to come in and invest to get their money back in 30, 40 yearsâ time, when you are saying thereâs going to be a freeze? âI think this is simply not consistent, not economically objective.â The investment bank Liberum Capital said yesterday that Â£6.7billion has been wiped off energy shares in Britain since Mr Miliband pledged on September 24 to freeze bills. It said that if Britainâs listed utility companies had kept pace with similar firms in Europe, their value would be around Â£11billion higher now. Angel Gurria, of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says it will destroy investment in the energy infrastructure needed to keep the lights on . The chief executive of Npower said . that Britain needs new energy infrastructure because the country could . soon be close to an energy shortfall, raising the spectre of blackouts. Paul . Massara said: âThe amount of spare generation at the peak has gone down . from about 15 per cent to this winter when weâll be about 5 per cent. Next winter will be even smaller. The leadership of Ed Miliband has been âa considerable gift to the Tory partyâ, Labour peer Lord Puttnam said yesterday. The film producer said the Labour leaderâs brother David would have given the Government âa much tougher timeâ. He accused Mr Miliband of beating David to the position with a âbloc voteâ by trade unions â and said he lacked experience. Lord Puttnam spoke out as it emerged Ed Miliband is seeking advice from Blairite big hitters. A leaked memo shows he consults Alastair Campbell every month, and Blairite âultraâ Alan Milburn every six weeks. Others to be consulted include: former Mandelson aides Ben Wegg-Prosser and Patrick Loughran; Blair press officer Matthew Doyle; and adviser DJ Collins. âSo will we get through this winter? Yes. Will we get through next winter? I donât know.â EDF boss Vincent de Rivaz also called for âmassiveâ infrastructure investment. Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint said excess energy company profits had pushed customer bills too high, and the price freeze was necessary. She added: âThe public have been overcharged. Wholesale prices dropped substantially in 2009. That was never reflected in a pass on to consumers. Thereâs been a distortion ever since.â But Mr Massara said it was unfair to criticise the profits of the so-called Big Six energy firms. âIn 2012 we made about a 3.5 per cent margin,â he said. âThat is hardly excessive. Unfortunately... suppliers are the easiest thing to shoot at. Warnings of an energy shortfall came as Sir Mark Walport, the Governmentâs chief scientific adviser, said shale gas could produce new energy but create less carbon dioxide than coal, adding: âItâs a better fuel. As part of a fuel mix to a low-carbon future, itâs a sensible thing to do.â Meanwhile, Cuadrilla, the firm fracking for shale gas, yesterday said it had found enough in Lancashire to fuel Britain for 50 years. Company boss Allan Campbell compared the potential to that of North Sea oil and pledged that the public in fracking areas would benefit to the tune of billions of pounds. He added: âThere is so much gas that we can give the supernormal profits to the people it belongs to â the people of Britain. We want to give away billions.â","Bills freeze takes no account of fluctuating energy prices, says expert .

A UKIP councillor has denied racism accusations over comments on immigration made on a video five years ago. Footage emerged yesterday of Victoria Ayling â a former Conservative election candidate who defected this year â saying she wished to âsend the lot backâ. The councillor denied being offensive or politically incorrect, and insisted she had been referring only to people in the country illegally. UKIP has backed its councillor Victoria Ayling, who was filmed saying she wanted to send immigrants home . Party leader Nigel Farage dismissed allegations that she held extreme views as a political smear and indicated his party would stand by her. Mrs Ayling, a councillor in East Lindsey, Lincolnshire, made the video in 2008, to promote her bid to become a Tory MEP. The Mail on Sunday said it was provided to them by her then husband, who operated the camera. They have since divorced acrimoniously. In a section published online, she is seen rehearsing her pitch on the issue â talking about the need to control the numbers arriving in the UK and to repatriate âthe illegals and failed asylum seekersâ. âThatâs not quite policy yet. Maybe I should soften it a bit,â she says at one point, adding: âOK. Send them back.â In a later take, she says: âWe must control immigration. We cannot sustain the numbers coming in; the strains on our infrastructure are enormous. UKIP leader Nigel Farage backed Mrs Ayling and decried the 'appalling attack on one of our councillors' 'Control should be done fairly and the points system like they have in Australia and all those coming here should be encouraged to speak English so they can integrate.â Afterwards, she is heard to say âI just want to send the lot back but I canât say thatâ before joking that the remark might be used in future to âget back at me, bribery, blackmailâ. In March Mrs Ayling made headlines by telling David Cameron publicly at a conference that she was quitting his Tory party for UKIP. At the 2010 general election she came within 714 votes of winning Great Grimsby from Labour for the Conservatives. Defending her comments, she told the Mail on Sunday it was ânothing different from what the Home Secretary is advocating now anywayâ. âI donât think there is anything there that can be seen as offensive or politically incorrect,â she said. âI stand by what I said: illegal immigrants should be sent back home and multiculturalism wonât work. It was a throwaway comment that has been taken out of context.â Mr Farage went on Twitter to decry âan appalling attack on one of our councillors, falsely saying she is against all immigrationâ. He said: âI have met her two or three times and I have discussed policy at length before accepting her into the party. I had no reason to believe she held views that were extreme or inconsistent with ours. âWhile this comment looks odd and unpleasant there may be a context here that is slightly different to the way it appears.â Last night Mrs Ayling pointed out that the video had been made public by her ex-husband. In a statement she said: âI have been overwhelmed with the messages of support I have been receiving, particularly via social media, and was very interested to read that many people â women in particular â read between the lines of this story and saw a man scorned and a woman trying to make her way in politics being used and caught in the crossfire of a party still trying to position itself after many years.â","Victoria Ayling denied being offensive or politically incorrect .

When . it launched Tescoâs Hudl was the cheapest tablet on the market and sold . incredibly well, with supermarkets shifting 35,000 models inÂ  the first . 48 hours, and it has sold out twice since. Last week nearly every colour model, other than purple, is shown as âcurrently unavailableâ on Tescoâs website, and a number of accessories arenât available either. This has raised fears customers may not be able to get hold of the cut-price gadget in time for Christmas. Yet, the company has dismissed claims that the shortfall is due to supply problems. The Hudl is manufactured by French company Archos. It has 16GB of built-in memory - the same as the iPad mini and Googleâs Â£80 more expensive Nexus 7 - and can access the internet and stream music and movies as well as on-demand TV services from Tesco-owned Blinkbox. It has front and rear-facing cameras, allowing users to talk face to face via Skype, too.

Appleâs second-generation iPad mini was launched last month, and costs Â£319, but has a slightly larger 7.9-inch screen.

Over 100 homeowners were issued threatening letters telling them their houses were to be bulldozed in a 'breathtaking error' on the part of a local council, it has emerged. The residents, many of whom are elderly, were warned they would face criminal prosecution if they did not go along with the sale of their houses to a council contractor. Hampshire County Council has apologised for the letters which detailed plans for the new Stubbington bypass. Homeowners were left horrified when they received this threatening letter which claimed their houses would be bulldozed to make way for a new bypass . Around 150 of 500 drafted letters were mistakenly issued to local residents on Friday morning, with recipients being told they had just 14 days to respond. Council representatives have reportedly spent the weekend delivering letters of apology to those affected, claiming the notice was meant only for a handful of local landowners. Councillor Sean Woodward, executive member for transport said: 'I would like to apologise to residents who received letters and for any distress this may have caused. 'A breakdown of communication between the council and the consultants led to an inaccurate letter being mistakenly issued. 'I have asked that the exact circumstances be investigated and measures put in place to ensure nothing like this can happen in the future.' His apology seems to have fallen on deaf ears however, with some homeowners struggling to understand why such an error could occur in the first place. Residents of Burnt House Lane in Stubbington were left dumbstruck by the letters which have been described as a 'breathtaking error' One recipient, Barry Gee said: 'It is a bit shocking for anybody... A mistake is a mistake, but why did it happen? 'You have to wonder whatâs the real reason why they sent so many letters? How did the mistake happen?' Pensioner Elizabeth Abbott, who lives on the same street, added: 'Do we even really need a bypass? Whatever they do will not be enough.' Chris Wood, county councillor for Fareham Crofton, said: 'I am terribly sorry this error has occurred and the needless anguish it has caused some of my residents. 'This is absolutely unacceptable, I am as angry as some of them are. 'I can assure villagers this was sent in error and no homes are to face compulsory purchase orders. 'The letters were meant to inform of ecological surveys, the company overstepped its remit and caused good people needless worry.' Stubbington Borough councillor Jim Forrest described the incident as a 'breathtaking error.' He . said: 'There is a lot of elderly residents in that area and they spent . the weekend worried about what will happen to their homes. Barry Gee and Elizabeth Abbott who both live on Burnthouse Lane (pictured) were baffled by the mistake, and questioned whether the area need a bypass in the first place . An estimated 150 residents received the letters on Friday morning. Hampshire County Council have since insisted no homes will be destroyed in the construction of the bypass . A Hampshire County Council spokesman said: 'We would like to apologise unreservedly for any distress caused by a letter that was sent out in error to around 150 householders in the Fareham area by consultants working on developing proposals for Stubbington Bypass. 'The County Council would like to reassure residents there are no plans to Compulsory Purchase any residential properties as part of work to develop options for a Stubbington bypass. 'The letter issued to householders, by consultants working with the Council, was intended for owners of land directly affected by the route options consulted on earlier this year, but was inadvertently sent to residents in the surrounding areas.' After considering three proposed routes for the new bypass, the council has said it will investigate alternative options and carry out ecological research before making a decision.","Letters were mistakenly sent to 150 residents in the village of Stubbington .

But one fearless swimmer embraced the potentially fatal meeting with open arms, by tossing fish into the predator's gaping jaws. The moment was captured by underwater photographer Daniel Botelho at Tiger Beach in the Bahamas where visitors can feed the powerful animals by hand. Fearless diver Vincent Canabal fed a female Tiger shark called Emma during the dive at Tiger Beach in the Bahamas . The huge shark opened wide for Mr Canabal at the resort where visitors can hand-feed the animals . The 32-year-old said: 'They look pretty scary when they open their mouths. 'You need to give the shark some space and let it know you are there before it arrives to grab the fish.' But the Brazilian warned the experience was not one for the faint-hearted. 'You need to have lots of respect, caution and be mentally focused throughout,' he added. Mr Botelho took to the water with seasoned divers Vincent and Debra Canabal to achieve the dramatic photographs. Photographer Daniel Botelho was able to capture the moment but warned the experience was not for the faint-hearted . Tiger sharks are known to swallow their prey whole and feed on a variety of crustacean, fish, seals and smaller sharks . Among them is an image of Mr Canabal feeding a four-metre long female Tiger shark called Emma. Despite the huge risk involved with such dives, Mr Botelho claimed 'shark tourism' is one of the few ways to preserve the species for future generations. 'The truth is that when 90 per cent of the tiger shark population is gone because of the finning market, tourism will be the only way that will keep sharks alive.' 'I believe that tourism and feeding are not a problem if this is keeping sharks protected from the extinction.' Feeding time: Two sharks approach the dive team at Tiger Beach in the Bahamas . Mr Botelho claims 'shark tourism' is one of the few ways to ensure the animals' future as the demand for shark finning increases . Since 1972 it is thought the global Tiger shark population has fallen by 97 per cent due to the increase of shark finning. Twenty species of shark are listed as endangered by the World Conservation Union as the demand for shark fin soup grows. Tiger sharks are known to swallow anything that crosses their paths, feeding on a variety of fish, birds, seals and smaller sharks.","Seasoned diver took to the water in the Bahamas to hand-feed Tiger sharks .

The company want to see the storeâs name change because Specialized own the trademark on the word Roubaix, which they use to market a brand of road bike. Mr Richter says he didnât name his store after the companyâs bike, but rather after a region in France that hosts one of the most famous bike races in the world, the grueling 117-year-old Paris-Roubaix. Essentially, the name is an icon of bike culture and there a hundreds of other products from bike tires to a cycling tights that use French region's name. 'Itâs been frustrating,' Mr Richter told the Calgary Herald. 'The response throughout this process (from Specialized) has been arrogant and almost unbelievably dismissive.' The rights: Specialized claims this is a matter of defending a legally owned trademark . What next? Richter has sought legal assistance in determining whether Roubaix can be registered in Canada. However, he estimates it will take upwards of $150,000 to contest the case in court, a price which may be prohibitive to the small business owner . 'We didnât want to go public, but theyâve made it clear on no uncertain terms, they are going to sue.' Larry Koury, managing director of Specialized Canada Inc says the company has a right to defend its legally owned trademark. 'A simple trademark search would have prevented this,' Koury wrote in an email, along with a reference to the federal governmentâs trademark database showing Specializedâs registration of the word Roubaix. 'We are required to defend or lose our trademark registration.' Mr Richter who served in Afghanistan says running the store has helped him over come post-traumatic stress disorder. After making a search online he did not feel that naming his shop after a geographical location would contradict Canadaâs intellectual property protection laws. 'I had assumed I could not register Roubaix as a trademark as it is a geographical location well known in cycling, not to mention the wide-spread use of the term Roubaix throughout the industry,' said Mr Richter. The real story: Richter, a military veteran medically released from service in 2012 after developing PTSD during deployment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, opened his shop on March 1, 2013 and asserts the shop's name is an homage to Roubaix, France . Innocent: 'I had assumed I could not register Roubaix as a trademark as it is a geographical location well known in cycling, not to mention the wide-spread use of the term Roubaix throughout the industry,' said Richter . 'I thought I could freely use Roubaix. To be informed I cannot use the name is devastating. I invested my life savings, military severance pay, as well as all my Veteran's Affairs award for my illness into CafÃ© Roubaix.' Furthermore, his store sells high-end bikes and does not sell Specialized products. He doesnât believe the name would confuse anybody shopping for bikes. 'I understand the need for the protection of intellectual property, but this is named after a city known worldwide for this race,' Mr Richter said. 'For our customer base, thereâs an appeal (with the name Roubaix). Our market understands that race, and it reflects what we want to provide for them.' Richter says his lawyer thinks they have a good case to make, but the fight could cost upwards of $150,000 in legal fees. He claims that changing his companyâs name isnât as simple as putting up a new sign and logo. In the year since the store opened he has built up a decent brand, reputation and online presence. There appears to be some positive news as a result of the potential brawl; CafÃ© Roubaix is also selling far more products from its online store than usual. A number of cyclists have changed their Twitter to include the word Roubaix and say they will be boycotting Specialized until it backs down. Ideas: 'I thought I could freely use Roubaix. To be informed I cannot use the name is devastating. I invested my life savings, military severance pay, as well as all my Veteran's Affairs award for my illness into CafÃ© Roubaix.'","Specialized owns the trademark for the use of Roubaix on certain cycling products .

Now, she has decided to spend Â£70,000 on a winter refuge - providing migrants with running water, heating and a sanitary block. The . camp - situated in the centre of Calais - is similar in concept to the . infamous Sangatte asylum centre, which attracted thousands of UK-bound . migrants before it was closed by the . French authorities in 2002. It opened its doors early last Thursday to a queue of more than 100 Syrians, Eritreans and Afghans.

He tried in vain to clear up this dogâs dinner after the draw forced England north, but the damage has been done. From there they will head down to Sao Paulo, via their base in Rio de Janeiro for a few days, to play Uruguay on June 19. It . sounds awful to say this but, by the time England arrive in Belo .

Instead England have another meeting with Gianluigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo, Thiago Motta and that beast Balotelli. Thatâs a massive game for England and the clash againstÂ  Uruguay will be another showstopper. They . will head to a city where the traffic never moves and it is here that . Englandâs World Cup campaign could come to a standstill. Somehow, . Uruguay threatened to make a mess of qualification until they ran into . Jordan in the play-offs and thumped them 5-0 on aggregate. Hodgsonâs side will have to contain two players that he elevated into the category of âworld classâ following the draw here. He knows all about Suarez, of course, and there is the added threat of Paris Saint-Germain forward Edinson Cavani. Beyond that itâs Costa Rica, where former Derby andÂ  Manchester City striker Paulo Wanchope is the assistant coach.

Porky: Ruby piled on the pounds and looked like a barrel on four legs after she ate lots of dog treats . But now the five-year-old is far friskier and in the best of health after shedding a third of her bodyweight. Yesterday the trimmed down terrier was named winner of the Pet Slimmer of the Year award.

George Zimmerman's girlfriend has dropped charges against him just weeks after she claimed he pointed a shotgun at her and smashed her stuff, and now she even wants him back, it has emerged. Samantha Scheibe called 911 in November, telling operators Zimmerman was brandishing a weapon during an argument and that she feared for her life. He was charged with felony aggravated assault among other lesser charges. But he is now asking to have conditions of his bail modified so he can resume contact with Scheibe, who, according to court documents filed by Zimmerman's attorney, gave a sworn statement that read: 'I do not want George Zimmerman charged.' Zimmerman, 30, had been barred from seeing or contacting the 27-year-old blonde after he posted $9,000 bond. He was also forced to give up his guns and wear a GPS monitor. According to ABC News, Scheibe says in a new affidavit, dated December 6, 'When I was being questioned by police I felt very intimidated...I believe that the police misinterpreted me and that I may have misspoken about certain facts in my statement to police.' Scheibe goes on to say in the statement that Zimmerman 'never pointed a gun at or toward my face in a threatening manner' and that she wants 'to be with George' and is 'not afraid of George in any manner.' Then she wrote: 'I make this decision freely, knowingly and voluntarily, and without coercion' Zimmerman's attorney Jayne Weintraub claims Scheibe reached out to her and asked that the order barring contact between the pair be lifted so they could rekindle their love.

Shellie filed for divorce, Zimmerman moved into Scheibe's Seminole . County home but, according to her, their relationship soon fell apart . because of his depression. In an interview, she said she helped him after he spiraled into a very dark place and tried . to kill himself multiple times, once putting a gun in his mouth and . threatening to pull the trigger. In . late October, she demanded he get professional help but she said this . made him angry and he moved all her furniture, clothes and food out of . her home. They later made up and he moved her things back into the house. But the relationship remained . volatile and on one occasion soon after, Scheibe sought refuge at her . mother Hope Mason's house to get away from Zimmerman. While . there, Mason told ClickOrlando that Zimmerman sent Scheibe's daughter a . still image from an intimate home video of Scheibe and Zimmerman. 'He's now threatened her in writing and even sent a portion of the video to her baby girl,' Mason wrote in a text. Despite this, the couple reunited again. But on November 18, a terrified Scheibe called 911 for help, telling the . operator Zimmerman put his gun in her face and was smashing up her . furniture. Mother and daughter: Scheibe, right, and her mother, Hope Mason, left, were in touch with news outlets as they were negotiating an interview that never materialized. Mason was aware of how frightened her daughter was . In cuffs again: George Zimmerman appeared in court earlier in November on charges including aggravated assault stemming from the November 19 fight . He was charged with aggravated . assault, ordered to keep his distance and also hand over his firearms. In messages to ClickOrlando, Scheibe said Zimmerman changed as soon as he was acquitted in the Trayvon Martin case. She . said he spiraled into a very deep depression after the media frenzy . went away and while he was prescribed medication, after a while he . stopped taking it. Scheibe described how he spent days in bed, refusing to get up. One day she found him passed out with an empty bottle of sleeping pills on his sidetable. She claims he overdosed and she wasn't able to revive him but noticed he was still breathing. When he did wake, she said he started crying and then put a gun inside his mouth, telling her he was ready to end it all. She said she talked him out of killing himself. But this wasn't the only occasion he threatened to take his own life, she said. According to Scheibe, Zimmerman enjoyed the media attention he received from the Trayvon case and grew depressed when he wasn't in the headlines.","Samantha Scheibe, 27, called 911 in November, telling operators Zimmerman was brandishing a weapon during an argument at their Florida home .
He was charged with felony aggravated assault but she now says she doesn't want to press charges, despite earlier detailing his intense depression and how she feared him .
In a December 6 affidavit, filed in court by Zimmerman's attorney, Scheibe writes how she felt 'very intimidated' by police and that they may have 'misinterpreted me'

Official figures showed alcohol-related hospital admissions among those aged 45 and over have more than doubled in the past decade. Among those in their 60s, admissions have almost tripled. Figures released by the Government's Health and Social Care Information Centre reveal alcohol-related admissions for those of the age of 45 have doubled in the last decade. File picture . The increase is much lower among young adults, indicating that liver disease and alcoholism are much bigger problems among the middle-aged than previously thought. Data from the Governmentâs Health and Social Care Information Centre shows that in 2012/13, a total of 26,209 men and 12,461 women aged 45 to 49 ended up in hospital purely due to alcohol. This was the highest total for any five-year age group. But the statistics reveal that the greatest increase in hospital treatment for alcohol problems over the past decade was among those in their 60s. During that period there was a 178 per cent rise in admissions of men aged 65 to 69 and a 177 per cent increase in admissions for women aged 60 to 64. Admissions more than doubled for every age group over 45. Experts said this was the cumulative effect of life-long drinking by the baby-boomer generation who felt liberated from societal constraints in the 1960s and 1970s. But they added that many older people are drinking too much now. In contrast, the smallest rises among adults in the past ten years were seen among those in their 30s â perhaps because this is the age at which many people settle down and have children. Eric Appleby, of charity Alcohol Concern, said: âToo many of us of all ages are drinking too much too often and risking our health because of it. âItâs easy to think that this is just a problem for binge-drinking youngsters but Alcohol Concernâs harm map shows that itâs the middle-aged, and often middle-class drinkers, regularly drinking above recommended limits, who are actually requiring complex and expensive NHS care. 'We have to wake up to the scale of the problem across the whole of society if weâre to reverse these frightening statistics.â Julia Manning, of the 2020 Health think tank, said: 'There is often a focus on binge drinking amongst the young but these figures show that older people need to take a look at their drinking' Julia Manning, of the 2020 Health think tank, said: âThere is often a focus on binge drinking amongst the young but these figures show that older people need to take a look at their drinking. Middle-aged, middle-class drinkers are drinking much more than they realise. âThey are drinking more frequently, they are drinking stronger alcohol and they are using it as a common antidote for stress. Alcohol has also become much cheaper in real terms.â She added: âWe have become ever more rebellious in recent decades and it makes me wonder whether there has been a significant culture shift away from taking responsibility and behaving like a grown-up.â The figures show there has also been a significant surge in alcohol-related hospital admissions among women in their 20s. In the past ten years, there wasÂ  a 111 per cent increase in admissions for women aged 20 to 24, and a 124 per cent rise among those aged 25 to 29. More than 10,600 women in their 20s were admitted for alcohol problems in 2012/13. The figures are likely to spark fresh fears of a rising âladette cultureâ. Though there was an increase among men in their 20s it was not as stark â just over 80 per cent. Worryingly, there was a 36 per cent rise in alcohol-related hospital cases among girls aged 15 to 19 and an 8 per cent rise for boys. But the number of admissions for youngsters aged 14 and under has fallen. Separate analysis shows that since 1970, deaths from liver disease have risen five-fold among the under-65s. Mortality from every other major disease has fallen. Dr Nick Sheron, a liver specialist at the University of Southampton, said: âWhat we are seeing is really dramatic and absolutely tragic. âSocietyâs relationship with alcohol has changed fundamentally in the past few decadesââ¦âand this is the impact of it.â","Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show alcohol-related admissions for the over-45s have doubled in a decade .

I canât really put it into words, it was just the best moment ever.' She embraced her figure and over the next six years became a confident and successful model. 'It was a very gradual process, but I eventually became really comfortable in my own skin. Iâd dabbled in a bit of modelling before, but never really felt comfortable, but after my job I was so much happier with my body.

Last month, she was delighted when a ruling in a commercial court in Toulon, France, opened the way to interim compensation of 3,000 Euros, with the possibility of it being increased to 16,000 Euros if an appeal fails. The court ruled that a German safety company, TUV Rheinland, which certified the implants, shared responsibility with the now bankrupt French supplier Poly Implant Prothhse, meaning more than 1,600 women, including about 100 in Britain, will receive the initial settlement. Miss Cathey said: 'This ruling is a huge step in the right direction for myself and other women.

A sheriff has refused to fly the U.S. flag at half-mast today in honor of Nelson Mandela because the late South African leader is 'not an American'. Rick Clark, the sheriff in Pickens County, South Carolina, posted a message on Friday saying that he would ignore President Obama's executive order intended as a mark of respect to Mandela, a leader regarded globally as an inspiration for leading South Africa out of apartheid. Sheriff Clark's Facebook message appears to have since been removed, but it read: 'Nelson Mandela did great things for his country and was a brave man but he was not an AMERICAN!!!' Scroll down for video . Rick Clark (pictured left), the sheriff of Pickens County, South Carolina, is refusing to lower the flag to half-staff to honor the life of Nelson Mandela . The American flag flies at half-staff above the White House in honor of South African leader Nelson Mandela on December 6 . He said that the flag would be lowered to honor a local officer who had died and also to mark the remembrance of Pearl Habor on Saturday. There is no penalty for ignoring an executive order to lower a flag to half-mast.Â  There are also precedents for foreigners being honored by the lowering of the American flag. In 1965, President Johnson issued an order to lower flags to half-mast following the death of British prime minister Winston Churchill. George W. Bush lowered flags following the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005. Nelson Mandela died on December 5 at the age of 95 in Johannesburg. Sheriff Clark wrote that he believes the American flag should be lowered at the U.S. Embassy in South Africa. He told Fox: 'It's just my simple opinion that the flag should only be lowered to half-staff for Americans who sacrificed for their country. 'I have no problem lowering it in South Africa in their country but not for our country. It should be the people who have sacrificed for our country. He added: 'I think it's great in America we can disagree.' Sheriff Clark's Facebook post appears to have been taken down after it was posted on Friday . The sheriff then followed up on Saturday with the message: 'Well the news/Facebook cycle has run its course. Time to move onto the next subject because I have work to do for my community and need to devote my time elsewhere. 'Thank you for your support and comments. I urge you to read about President Mandela over the next few days of mourning and be inspired for public service for your community and the nation as he was. It Pearl Harbor Day and thank a veteran today if you can.' There was support for the sheriff's actions on his Facebook page from local people. Brian Davis posted: 'I agree and you did the right thing.... Just saying.' Dana Kelly wrote: 'I appreciate working for you knowing that you're not a ''yes man''. This country was founded with strong backbones and seems a lot of folks have lost sight of this. Thank you Sheriff.' Deanna Counts added: 'Rick, you do what is right no matter what anyone else says! Make us proud. Our flag is for our citizens and our country!' President Obama headed for South Africa on Monday to attend a national memorial service for anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela. Along with First Lady Michelle, the President boarded Air Force One under cold, rainy skies for the long flight. The occasion presented an opportunity for a rare get-together of American presidents.

Former President Bill Clinton was traveling separately from Rio de Janeiro, where he was attending a Clinton Global Initiative event. And former President Jimmy Carter also planned to join the group in Johannesburg. George H.W. Bush is the only living president who will not attend. His spokesman said the 89-year-old no longer is able to travel long distances.

A 16-year-old has become the UKâs strongest schoolgirl â and says her success is thanks to a joint condition that used to cause her agonising pain. Laresce Browne, from Eccles, Manchester, has six British and World Champion powerlifting records under her belt - yet until just two years ago a condition called hypermobility left her in so much pain she was unable to take part in sport. Rather than let her condition limit her life, Laresce took inspiration from her weight-lifting father, Adam, 39, and began pumping iron. Laresce Browne (pictured lifting muscle man Chris Hedge), 16, is the UK's strongest schoolgirl despite suffering from painful hypermobility syndrome . This put an end to her pain and she became champion in her field. She now holds a UK record for deadlifting more than twice her own bodyweight after lifting 105kg. She can also bench press her own bodyweight of 50kg (7st 12lbs). From birth, Laresceâs toes and knees grew inward and doctors diagnosed her with metatarsus varus, commonly known as pigeon toe. The condition means her feet turned inwards. It usually corrects itself by the age of eight or nine and does not require treatment. Ms Browne thinks her hypermobility has been the key to her weightlifting success as it means her spine bends more than most people's and this gives her greater leverage for lifting . As a result of her weightlifting, Ms Browne says she no longer feels any pain from her hypermobility as she has strengthened the muscles around her weak joints . They also said she had hypermobility, which meant her joints had a greater range of movement than usual. The condition can cause severe joint pain and lead to dislocations. Laresceâs trainer Tania George, 43, says this is the secret to her success - she has more flexibility in her back than most people which means her technique in forming an arch in her spine leaves the competition behind. âMost powerlifters would kill to be able to form an action-arch like Laresce,â said Ms George. âBecause she has perfected the technique of bending her back strongly and safely she has the leverage to lift incredibly heavy weights.â Ms Browne suffered daily knee, elbow and hand pain as a result of the condition that causes her joints to have a greater range of mobility than they should . When she was younger Ms Browne missed countless days of school because of the pain - she was in such agony that she was often unable to sleep. She also had to give up PE and dancing . Despite these her conditions, Laresce loves to dance and between the ages of four and eleven she was a keen Morris dancer. As her body began to change from the ages of 11 to 14, the 5ft 2ins tall pupil began to face daily pain in her knees, elbows and hands from her hypermobility that left her unable to sleep for whole nights at a time. She was forced to miss several days of school each month due to pain and the lack of sleep this caused. Eventually she was told by doctors she could not take part in any sports lessons for eight months. After nearly dislocating her hip, Laresce was also forced to give up Morris dancing. Ms Browne said: 'I used to suffer a lot of pain from my hypermobility. When I was eleven I remember coming home from school with pains in my knees, joints and hips' âI used to suffer a lot of pain from my hypermobility,â she said. âWhen I was eleven I remember coming home from school with pains in my knees, joints and hips. âIt would stop me doing normal things like taking part in sports at school. âThe pain would be so much that some nights I wouldnât sleep at all and I just couldnât face going to school like that. âAfter almost dislocating my hip I had to do six months of physiotherapy to recover.â However, since taking up the sport of powerlifting 18 months ago she is now effectively cured. To cement her success, Laresce must train for eight hours a week. âI become involved when I started going down to see my Dad weight lift at the gym,â she said. âI really enjoyed the feeling of power I got and the excitement of people encouraging me to do my very best. âI find it fun to take part in - you have to be a bit aggressive when lifting which I think surprises people when it comes from me. âIâve made lots of friends and it an incredible feeling when everyoneâs cheering me on. Itâs the support of other people that makes the difference to winning. âBecoming a champion was a big surprise - I just started off for fun and I wasnât expecting anything. So to win six titles over just a few months was amazing.â Lascesce says her friends were surprised to learn she had taken up a fiercely competitive sport normally associated with fully-grown men. But she admitted some were a little jealous of her new found fame and popularity in her chosen field. Her trainer, Ms George, said: âLaresceâs . position as Britainâs strongest powerlifter for her age and weight is . down to her spirit and determination. Ms Browne (pictured lifting fellow bodybuilder, Mustafa Naamani) says some of her friends were surprised when she took up an 'aggressive' sport but that they are now a bit jealous of her success . Ms Browne (pictured as a toddler) was also born with pigeon toes but the condition corrected itself over time . âShe started visiting the gym just to hang out with her dad from the age of nine. âOne day when she was about 14 she just asked to have a go and under supervision we allowed her to try it. âAfter this, Lascene started to join in with our womenâs strength classes. âEven though she is alongside women three times her age with greater experience and well above her weight category, she is head and shoulders above the rest. âThis success is due to her hypermobility, a condition which she had to work incredibly hard to master. Ms Browne's trainer, Tania George (pictured), said: 'The bottom line is Laresce is a lovely and beautiful teenager who has unlocked a hidden potential no-one could have guessed at' Ms Browne's father, Adam, said: 'I couldn't be more proud of my little girl. She's truly the apple of my eye and has worked so hard to be where she is today.' Ms Browne is pictured with Mr Olympia Champion Felix Lewis . âThe bottom line is Laresce is a lovely and beautiful teenager who has unlocked a hidden potential no-one could have guessed at.â Laresceâs father explained how he feels about being the father of such a high-achieving teen. âI couldnât be more proud of my little girl,â he said. âSheâs truly the apple of my eye and has worked so hard to be where she is today. âNo-one has handed her anything on a plate - itâs only through hours of hard practice most muscle-bound men would shy away from that my Laresce was able to be a winner. âSheâs made us all so very happy and I feel we all enjoy a bright future together thanks to her.â Joint hypermobility means some or all of a person's joints have an unusually large range of movement. People with the condition are very supple and able to move their limbs into positions others find impossible. Some people with hypermobile joints do not suffer any problems as a result and need no treatment. However, other patients suffer joint pain, dislocations and soft tissue injuries. Hypermobility syndrome can also cause fatigue. It can be treated with exercise and physiotherapy in a bid to improve muscle strength. The condition is hereditary and is thought to be linked to changes in a protein called collagen. Collagen is found throughout the body and, if it is weak, it causes fragility within the body. It is thought that as many as 30 per cent of people might have some degree of hypermobility. It is more common in women than men.

From healthy 'pale straw' to potentially dangerous 'brown ale', urine comes in a wide range of colours. Now doctors at a U.S. medical centre have drawn up a diagram to illustrate what is normal and what is not. The chart, developed at the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, says urine usually ranges from a deep amber or honey colour to a light straw colour, with many shades in between. The Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, has created a diagram which shows all of the different possible shades of urine colour and what they say about your health . It says the colour of a person's urine says a lot about what is going on inside their body, and that people should take heed of its warnings. The diagram shows that if a person's urine has no colour, it suggests they are drinking too much water and should consider cutting back. If it is a pale straw colour, the person's water consumption is at a healthy level and they are well-hydrated.The same applies if their urine is transparent yellow. However, if it is dark yellow, this suggests they should drink some water soon. As a person becomes more dehydrated, their urine will turn an amber or honey colour. This suggests they are not getting enough water and that they should drink some immediately. The diagram shows that urine should be straw coloured or pale yellow. If it is darker, it suggests the person is dehydrated. If it is red, it could contain blood . The colour of a person's urine can also be influenced by factors other than hydration. The diagram shows that if it is the colour of brown ale, this could be a sign of severe dehydration, but it could also be a sign of liver disease. Experts recommend that if a person notices their urine is this colour, they should drink some water and visit their doctor if it persists. Most people would, rightly, be concerned if their urine turned red. The diagram shows that if a person has not just eaten beetroot, blueberries or rhubarb their urine should not be pink or red. If it is, they should visit a doctor as it could be a sign of blood. This can be caused by kidney disease, tumours, prostate problems or a urinary tract infection. It could even be a sign of mercury poisoning. Having orange urine can also be suggestive of a problem. If a person's urine is fizzy it could be a sign that they are eating too much protein. It could also be a symptom of kidney problems . The diagram shows it can be a sign of dehydrations but it could also be a symptom of a liver or bile duct condition. In very rare cases, urine can turn blue or green. This can be caused by food dye or medication, but it could also be indicative of a rare genetic disease or of bacteria in the urinary tract. As a result, if a person's urine turns green, and stays that way, they are advised to visit a doctor. Finally, some people notice their urine has turned 'fizzy'. This can be caused by a harmless hydraulic effect, however, it can also be a sign of excessive protein in the diet, or of a kidney problem.","The Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, has drawn up a diagram showing all of the different possible shades of urine colour and what each one means .

One in five American adults will become rich at some point in their lifetime - earning more than $100,000 a year - new research revealed today. Made up largely of older professionals, . working married couples and more educated singles, the 'new rich' are . those with household incomes of $250,000 or more at some point during . their working lives. That puts them, if sometimes temporarily, in the . top two percent of earners. Graph showing percentage of Americans by age group, estimated to experience affluence for one year o more during their lives . But this little-known group may pose the biggest barrier to reducing the nation's income inequality. The growing numbers of the U.S. poor have been well documented, but survey data provided to The Associated Press detail the flip side of the record income gap - the rise of the 'new rich'. Even outside periods of unusual wealth, members of this group generally hover in the $100,000-plus income range, keeping them in the top 20 percent of earners. Companies increasingly are marketing to this rising demographic, fueling a surge of 'mass luxury' products and services from premium Starbucks coffee and organic groceries to concierge medicine and VIP lanes at airports. Political parties are taking a renewed look at the up-for-grabs group, once solidly Republican. They're not the traditional rich. In a country where poverty is at a record high, today's new rich are notable for their sense of economic fragility. They've reached the top two percent, only to fall below it, in many cases. That makes them much more fiscally conservative than other Americans, polling suggests, and less likely to support public programs, such as food stamps or early public education, to help the disadvantaged. Last week, President Barack Obama . asserted that growing inequality is 'the defining challenge of our . time,' signaling that it will be a major theme for Democrats in next . year's elections. New . research suggests that affluent Americans are more numerous than . government data depict, encompassing 21 percent of working-age adults . for at least a year by the time they turn 60. That proportion has more than doubled since 1979. At the same time, an increasing polarization of low-wage work and high-skill jobs has left middle-income careers depleted. 'For . many in this group, the American dream is not dead. They have reached . affluence for parts of their lives and see it as very attainable, even . if the dream has become more elusive for everyone else,' says Mark Rank, . a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who calculated . numbers on the affluent for a forthcoming book, 'Chasing the American . Dream,' to be published by the Oxford University Press. As . the fastest-growing group based on take-home pay, the new rich tend to . enjoy better schools, employment and gated communities, making it easier . to pass on their privilege to their children. Their success has implications for politics and policy. The . group is more liberal than lower-income groups on issues such as . abortion and gay marriage, according to an analysis of General Social . Survey data by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. President Barack Obama (pictured in July) asserted that growing inequality is 'the defining challenge of our time' But when it comes to money, their views aren't so open. They're wary of any government role in closing the income gap. In Gallup polling in October, 60 percent of people making $90,000 or more said average Americans already had 'plenty of opportunity' to get ahead. Among those making less than $48,000, the share was 48 percent. 'In this country, you don't get . anywhere without working hard,' said James Lott, 28, a pharmacist in . Renton, Wash., who adds to his six-figure salary by day-trading stocks. The . son of Nigerian immigrants, Lott says he was able to get ahead by . earning an advanced pharmacy degree. He makes nearly $200,000 a year. After . growing up on food stamps, Lott now splurges occasionally on nicer . restaurants, Hugo Boss shoes and extended vacations to New Orleans, . Atlanta and parts of Latin America. He . believes government should play a role in helping the disadvantaged. But he says the poor should be encouraged to support themselves, . explaining that his single mother rose out of hardship by starting a . day-care business in their home. 'I . definitely don't see myself as rich,' says Lott, who is saving to . purchase a downtown luxury condominium. That will be the case, he says, . 'the day I don't have to go to work every single day.' Sometimes . referred to by marketers as the 'mass affluent,' the new rich make up . roughly 25 million U.S. households and account for nearly 40 percent of . total U.S. consumer spending. While paychecks shrank for most Americans after the 2007-2009 recession, theirs held steady or edged higher. The new rich: In 2012, the top 20 percent of U.S. households took home a record 51 percent of the nation's income (multi-millionaires Kim Kardashian and Kanye West pictured) In 2012, the top 20 percent of U.S. households took home a record 51 percent of the nation's income. The median income of this group is more than $150,000. Once concentrated in the old-money enclaves of the Northeast, the new rich are now spread across the U.S., mostly in bigger cities and their suburbs. They include Washington, D.C.; Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle. By race, whites are three times more likely to reach affluence than nonwhites. Paul F. Nunes, managing director at Accenture's Institute for High Performance and Research, calls this group 'the new power brokers of consumption.' Because they spend just 60 percent of their before-tax income, often setting the rest aside for retirement or investing, he says their capacity to spend more will be important to a U.S. economic recovery. In Miami, developers are betting on a growing luxury market, building higher-end malls featuring Cartier, Armani and Louis Vuitton and hoping to expand on South Florida's Bal Harbour, a favored hideaway of the rich. 'It's not that I don't have money. It's more like I don't have time,' said Deborah Sponder, 57, walking her dog Ava recently along Miami's blossoming Design District. She was headed to one of her two art galleries â this one between the Emilio Pucci and Cartier stores and close to the Louis Vuitton and Hermes storefronts. But Sponder says she doesn't consider her income of $250,000 as upper class, noting that she is paying college tuition for her three children. 'Between rent, schooling and everything â it comes in and goes out.' Economists say the group's influence will only grow as middle-class families below them struggle. Corporate profits and the stock market are hitting records while the median household income of $51,000 is at its lowest since 1995. That's a boon for upper-income people who are more likely to invest in stocks. At the same time, some 54 percent of working-age Americans will experience near-poverty for portions of their lives, hurt by globalization and the loss of good-paying manufacturing jobs. Both Democrats and Republicans are awakening to the political realities presented by this new demographic bubble. Traditionally Republican, the group makes up more than 1 in 4 voters and is now more politically divided, better educated and less white and male than in the past, according to Election Day exit polls dating to the 1970s. Sixty-nine percent of upper-income voters backed Republican Ronald Reagan and his supply-side economics of tax cuts in 1984. By 2008, Democrat Barack Obama had split their vote evenly, 49-49. In 2012, Obama lost the group, with 54 percent backing Republican Mitt Romney. Still, Obama's performance among higher-income voters exceeded nearly every Democrat before him. Some Democratic analysts have urged the party to tread more lightly on issues of income inequality, even after the recent election of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who made the issue his top campaign priority. In recent weeks, media attention has focused on growing liberal enthusiasm for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., whose push to hold banks and Wall Street accountable could stoke Occupy Wall Street-style populist anger against the rich. 'For the Democrats' part, traditional economic populism is poorly suited for affluent professionals,' says Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University professor who specializes in political polarization. The new rich includes Robert Kane, 39, of Colorado Springs, Colo. A former stock broker who once owned three houses and voted steadfastly Republican, Kane says he was humbled after the 2008 financial meltdown, which he says exposed Wall Street's excesses. Now a senior vice president for a private equity firm specializing in the marijuana business, Kane says he's concerned about upward mobility for the poor and calls wealthy politicians such as Romney 'out of touch'. But Kane, now a registered independent, draws the line when it comes to higher taxes. 'A dollar is best in your hand rather than the government's,' he says.","By race, whites are three times more likely to reach affluence than nonwhites .

Attorneys for Elias Montoya say the veteran officer intends to file an appeal for wrongful termination. State Police Chief Pete Kassetas fired Montoya on Friday, one day after a disciplinary hearing. Scroll down for video . Appealing: Elias Montoya, a 12-year veteran of the New Mexico police, will appeal the decision to fire him after he shot at a van full of children . Force: Montoya (pictured), who has been accused of using excessive force, previously ran a non-violence program for young men and boys . Sacked: Elias Montoya, the officer that shot at a minivan full of children, was fired Friday from the New Mexico State Police .

Memphis, Tennessee, woman drove away from a traffic stop after an officer . knocked out her van's window with a baton. The buck stops here: New Mexico Police Chief Pete Kassetas made the decision to fire Montoya . The . motorist, 39-year-old Oriana Farrell, had been stopped by another State . Police officer for speeding. She fled twice after that officer tried to . give her a ticket and then arrest her. The officer was placed on administrative leave last week following an investigation into the shooting outside the northern New Mexico tourist town of Taos. Police chief KassetasÂ  would not comment on the issue, other than to say, 'I'm the chief. I take ownership of it. The buck stops here, so to speak.; . Supporters of the decision say Montoya, who had been a mentor to young men in a local nonviolence program, used excessive force. The other officer involved in the incident Tony DeTavis can be seen bashing in the minivan's window with a baton, to the sound of children's screams. According to KRQU, the department wouldn't say what steps would be taken with DeTavis, except to say that he is still employed. A 2010 Taos News article called Montoya a 'devoted father' in an article about the local Men Engaged in Nonviolence Program. Appeal: Montoya has 30 days to appeal his firing with the public safety advisory council . At the time, Montoya was a 'model mentor' to a 10-year-old boy in the program. 'My dad was a minister and things were expected of you. he taught me how to be responsible,' Montoya told the paper of his late father. 'If he can't get something from his dad, I want to be the person he can have confidence in. According to the article, Montoya taught his mentee how to play pool and took him to football games. 'They matched him with me because he wants to be a cop. I hope I can help him reach his goals,' Montoya said.# . A Facebook page called 'I support Officer Elias Montoya' has sprung up since news of his sacking was made public. There are already more than 5,000 'likes.' Last month, Ms Farrell gave her own account in the Taos News, telling her version of the dramatic traffic stop in October in which she claimed that she was only trying to protect her children from Montoya. Mother's instinct: Oriana Farrell, the woman who was driving the minivan, told the Taos News that she was just trying to protect her children . 'A uniformed officer can shoot three bullets at my van and be considered to be âdoing his jobâ, but my doing what I can to get my own children away from such a terrifying individual has been termed âchild abuseâ and âendangerment,â according to New Mexico law,' she wrote. Calling herself a 'peace officer,' Farrell writes: 'As a single, African-American mother of five in this country, things are tough enough I should not have to endure harassment at the hands of someone who has been hired to protect the citizens of this land over an alleged âspeeding offense.â No one should.' The . traffic stop took place south of Taos, New Mexico, on October 28 - but . it sparked local outrage after the video from a state police dashboard camera . went public. Footage shows the officer casually walk up to the vehicle and begin speaking with the driver. When the officer walks away, presumably to run the license and registration and decide whether to write a ticket, the van takes off. Coming to mom's rescue: At one point in the video, Ms Farrell's 14-year-old son is seen getting out of the vehicle to defend her . A short chase ensues before the driver again relents and the van makes its way to the side of the road. The . officer at this point has had enough. He storms up to and opens the . driverâs side door while ordering the driver out of the vehicle. She refuses and a struggle ensues as children inside the Ford can be heard screaming. The driverâs son, 14, according to ABC News, gets out of the van but thinks better of the idea as the cop pulls a Taser on him. Ms Farrell does eventually exit the vehicle and gets into a physical confrontation with the officer while he tries to arrest her. Cuffed: The officer moves to arrest Ms Farrell in front of her children . That's it: Having seen enough, the teen jumps out of the car to confront the officer . At this point, the teen appears to . attack the cop as Ms Farrell is at once being pulled back into the van . by a screaming younger girl and being pulled into the middle of the road . by the cop. The teen and the officer tussle before he runs back into the van as more police arrives to assist the over-matched officer. The primary officer is then shown . smashing the right rear passenger window with his baton as petrified . children trapped inside the van scream for help. Ms Farrell has had enough, she slams on the gas and drives away as a second officer opens fire on the back of her van â emptying multiple rounds in the direction of young children. A frantic chase through wrong-way traffic and a small town ensues before Ms Farrell finally gives herself up in front of a hotel. Multiple arrests: The teen can be seen led away in handcuffs in the foreground as his mother lie arrested on the sidewalk behind him . Both she and her son are seen being led away in handcuffs. The Taos News' editor said the paper does not usually publish op-ed pieces pertaining to ongoing legal cases, but made an exception in this case because of the huge public interest in the case. According to ABC News, she was charged with five counts of abuse of a child, aggravated fleeing an officer, resisting an officer, reckless driving and possession of drug paraphernalia. Her 14-year-old son was charged with battery of an officer. No word yet on whether the charges against Ms Farrell and her son will be dropped following the officer's dismissal.

Only one third of teenage girls in the U.S. have received all three doses of the HPV vaccine - and few people understand its effectiveness against cancer, a new study has found. Data from the Health Information National Trends Survey from 2012 to 2013 showed that 1,417 people were 'vaccine relevant' - but just 33 per cent of teen girls had received all three doses. And even fewer boys - around 5 percent - have gotten vaccinated against the human papillomavirus, a virus which can cause cervical, anal and . vulvar cancers, the study found. Vaccine: A study has found that a third of teen girls have failed to have the full HPV vaccine. The injections against HPV are given to prevent a sexually transmitted infection that can cause cancer . The study, which was presented at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research on Saturday, also found that black, Hispanic and . low-income women were less likely to have received it. The Centers for Disease Control and . Prevention recommends boys and girls aged 11 and 12 get the vaccine. In addition, women up to 26 and men up to 21 who did not receive the vaccine earlier in life are recommended to receive it. This puts the 'vaccine relevant' group between the ages of nine and 27. But the target group is also largely unaware of its effectiveness, the study round. Of the 3,551 adults who were part of the survey, 70 per cent said they were unsure of how well the vaccine prevented cervical cancer and only 25 per cent said they'd talked to a health care provider about the vaccine. 'Although human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination has been available for seven years, uptake remains low, and . evidence suggests disparities exist in vaccination completion,' said the authors of this study led by Kassandra I. Alcaraz, PhD, . MPH. Protection: The study also found that 70 per cent of people were unsure how effective the vaccine was . HPV - or the human papillomavirus - . is the most common sexually transmitted infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Anyone who has ever had . sex can get the virus and it's so common that nearly all sexually-active men . and women get it at some point in their lives. It can be passed through sex and oral sex, as well as genital contact, and most people do not even realize they have it. There are many . different types of HPV and while most infections go away without . issue, some can lead to serious problems such as genital warts . or cervical cancer. There is no certain way to tell who will develop health problems from HPV and who will not. Around 12,000 new cases of cervical . cancer are diagnosed every year, with about 4,000 deaths, according to . the American Cancer Society. Pre-teens, teenagers and young people can receive Cervarix and Gardasil, which protect against cervical cancer. Gardasil . also protects against genital warts and anal, vaginal and vulval . cancers. 'Perceptions about the HPV vaccine may be contributing to these . trends. 'This uncertainty may influence decision-making about getting vaccinated, and it hinders our ability to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality and reduce disparities in cervical cancer.' Researchers added that non-Hispanic . black respondents were the least likely to have confidence in the vaccine's effectiveness - just only 18.6 per cent said they had confidence in it. In addition, the chances of discussing the injection with a healthcare provider varied depending on education level; 34 per cent of college . graduates said they talked to a provider about the vaccine, compared to 21 per cent of those with less than a high . school education. The study added: 'Findings suggest HPV communication and . messages need refinement to clearly highlight vaccine efficacy, and . targeted strategies may be needed to reach non-Hispanic Blacks and . individuals with lower levels of education.' Girls can receive either Cervarix or Gardasil, while boys only receive . Gardasil. For its effectiveness, three doses are administered. The . three-shot series costs around $400 and insurance plans typically cover . them, according the CDC. A federally funded Vaccines for Children . program also offers help to those eligible. Around 12,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed every year, with about 4,000 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. They can be detected by pap smears.","Study found that 70 per cent of people in the correct age group for the vaccine were unsure how effective it was at protecting against cancer .

A former Lululemon ambassador has slammed the company in a blog post explaining why she is cutting ties with the yoga clothing brand. Diana Vitarelli, who runs yoga studios . in Philadelphia and New Jersey with her husband, John, says the company . takes advantage of financially-strapped instructors by promising them . free clothes and publicity in exchange for teaching overcrowded, free . classes to Lululemon shoppers. Mrs . Vitarelli adds that the entire premise of the Lululemon brand goes . against many of yogaâs spiritual concepts, and that its aesthetics have . little to do with those truly interested in the ancient Indian practice. Ambassadors no more: Diana (L) and John (R) Vitarelli have written an open letter to Lululemon to formally disassociate themselves from the brand . In . a post on their blog, Mrs Vitarelli and her husband John explained the . reasons why they are openly disassociating themselves from the label. Mrs . Vitarelli says that not only are Lululemonâs clothes un-yoga-like, but . the role of being a âbrand ambassadorâ has nothing to do with yogic . principles, which encourage modesty. For this reason, she says that the . role is a âdistracting goal for so many young teachers.â 'A . lot of those teachers are poor and struggling. They are going to take . the free clothes because they are broke and probably need them. They . cannot afford to actually shop in Lululemon though, and given a choice . even if they could afford to they might choose another brand,â she . writes. âItâs not even . necessarily a âyoga clothing store,ââ she added. âA yoga brand would . very likely appeal more to the sensibilities of a person actually . dedicated to yoga by offering organic tops and bottoms and items that . you can wash and dry for years and still look great like Prana and . Patagonia do.â Mrs Vitarelli . says that being a Lululemon ambassador entails teaching in-store . community classes in exchange for free clothes, trips, and publicity. Yoga instructors: Diana and John (performing partner yoga with their baby in tow, above) served as Lululemon co-ambassadors, but had moral concerns with the role . Instructors . are often by enlisted into the ambassadorship when Lululemon staff . appears at their studio classes with a âbig bouquet of flowersâ and make . âa big fuss over you in front of peopleâ¦Itâs kind of like being asked . to the prom in the middle of the High School pep rally,â she writes. At . first, Mrs Vitarelli rejected the brandâs offer. But years later she . and John were asked to act as co-ambassadors and teach the community . classes as a team, which would also help them promote Dhyana Yoga, the . chain of yoga studios that they jointly own. The Vitarellis accepted the . deal. But when Mrs . Vitarelli got pregnant, John was left to teach the classes alone. The . overcrowded classes were full of students who required âa lot of . adjustingâ¦to keep things safe,â writes Mrs Vitarelli. 'I donât think yoga teachers should sell out and be ""Ambassadors of"" or be ""Sponsored By"" anyone at all' In . her opinion, âthese classes are generally unsafe,â because there are . not enough teachers present to help correct the studentsâ form â many of . whom are yoga novices that have not developed the skills necessary for . avoiding an injury. The . brandâs purported safety hazards, as well as its retail and stylistic . standards, lead many yoga teachers to voice their disdain for Lululemon . among fellow instructors. But . many of the teachers expressing their Lululemon frustrations are acting . ambassadors for the brand, Mrs Vitarelli says. She finds their . hypocrisy to be unacceptable and a complete disregard for many yogic . principles. âIf you are one . of those âAmbassadorsâ one of those teachers taking the free gear but . making snarky remarks about the Lululemon brand in general conversation . or even in your head, then you should not be an ambassador,â Mrs . Vitarelli wrote in her essay. She added: âIn fact, I donât think yoga teachers should sell out and be âAmbassadors of"" or be âSponsored Byâ anyone at all. Loyal following: Though the Lululemon brand has a strong following, Diana says that the label's clothes and principles are far from yoga appropriate . âI . think itâs kind of gross for teachers to get all free-geared up by any . one brandâ¦[Lululemon] should keep to their business in their stores and . stay out of Yoga studios.â Mr . and Mrs Vitarelliâs open letter asked the brand to stop using their . images for promotion in any way and to never contact them again. Mrs . Vitarelli says that they have quietly given away all of the Lululemon . clothes that they were awarded for free. Mrs . Vitarelli even feels that the Lululemon ambassadorship is a farce . because though the brand builds the role up to be an honor, a mark of . achievement, âitâs not really even a special thing to be asked,â Mrs . Vitarelli writes. 'It's not really even a special thing to be asked to be a Lululemon ambassador' âEventually they get around to almost everyone in a market,' she elaborated. When . it comes down to it, she thinks the labelâs âownerâs antics and . politics, and itâs advertising and marketing campaigns have no place in . the yoga room. Yoga teachers do. Yoga students do. All that matters when . you practice is THAT you practice, not what you wear when you do it.â Their . commentary follows many recent Lululemon-centric scandals that range . from last yearâs sheer Luon pant debacle, to company CEO Chip Wilsonâs . comments that Lululemonâs clothes donât work for âsome womenâs bodies.â Earlier . this month, the labelâs Bethesda, MD outpost outraged local shoppers . with a holiday window display that rhymed apple pie with ârubbing . thighsâ The brand responded . to the backlash on its website with a statement to customers that read: . âWeâre deeply sorry, the display is being taken down.

Worsening summer heatwaves and downpours in Europe and the U.S. could be linked to a thaw in Arctic ice. A report published in âNature Climate Changeâ warned of increasingly extreme weather across âmuch of North America and Eurasia where billions of people will be affectedâ. The study, which was dismissed as inconclusive by some experts, has intensified debate about whether human-induced global warming is responsible for climate change. Worsening summer heatwaves and downpours thousands of miles south in Europe and the U.S. could be linked to a thaw in Arctic ice. The images above show sea ice coverage in 1980 . (right) and 2012 (left) Experts in China and the United States said they could not conclusively say the Arctic thaw caused more extreme weather, or vice versa. However, they said they had found evidence of a relationship between the two. Rising temperatures over thawing snow on land and sea ice in the Arctic were changing atmospheric pressure and winds, the report said. They claim the changes slowed the eastward movement of vast meandering weather systems and meant more time for extreme weather to develop. The report claims changes in the North Pole could increase erratic weather patterns. The UK has seen extreme weather over the past 30 years. Here, the flooded River Derwent breaks its banks and floods properties in the town of Cumbria . These included a heatwave in Russia in 2010, droughts in the United States and China in 2011 and 2012, or heavy summer rains that caused floods in Britain in 2012. The UK has seen extreme weather over the past 30 years, including the Great Storm of 1987, which claimed 22 lives, devastating floods at Boscastle in 2004 and Cockermouth in 2009 and October's storms, which killed four. The report follows a warning by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that extreme weather will continue to become more frequent. âThe study contributes to a growing body of evidence that ... the melting Arctic has wide-ranging implications for people living in the middle latitudes,â lead author Qiuhong Tang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences told Reuters. Rising temperatures over thawing snow on land and sea ice in the Arctic were changing atmospheric pressure and winds, the report said . Sea ice in the Arctic shrank to a record low in 2012 and the U.N.'s panel of climate scientists says it could almost vanish in summers by 2050 with rising greenhouse gas emissions. But some scientists said other factors, including the usual vagaries of weather or changing sea temperatures, may explain some recent extremes rather than changes in the Arctic. âThe jury is still very much out,â James Screen, an expert at Exeter University, said of efforts to see if there is a link between a melting Arctic and extremes further south in the northern hemisphere. Some evidence in Sunday's study was âplausible ... but far from conclusive,â he said, adding that some of the data were not statistically significant and might be random variations. Parts of central Europe have suffered vast floods in the Danube and Elbe basins while parts of France, Italy and Spain (pictured) have been ravaged by bush fires and heatwaves . âFor people on the streets, what really matters is whether the extremes are changing or not. But from the scientific perspective we want to understand why,â he said.Â  Better understanding is vital to make reliable predictions. In September, the U.N.'s panel of climate scientists raised the probability that most global warming since 1950 has a human cause - mostly gases released by burning fossil fuels - to 95 per cent from 90 in a previous assessment in 2007. James Overland, of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said many extremes studied were in the past decade, too short to know for sure if they were enhanced by Arctic ice and snow melt or not. âSceptics remain unconvinced that Arctic/mid-latitude linkages are proven, and this work will do little to change their viewpoint,â he wrote in a comment in Nature Climate Change. The costs of extreme weather events have risen dramatically, climate scientists warned last week. The national science academies of EU Member States believe Europe needs to plan for future probabilities of extreme weather, such as heat waves, floods and storms. Highlighting a 60 per cent rise over the last 30 years in the cost of damage from extreme weather events across Europe, the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (EASAC) warned of the grave economic and social consequences if European policy makers do not use the latest estimates of future droughts, floods and storms in their planning while adapting to global warming and the resulting climate disruption. The report urges EU nations to prepare for heat waves and think about how to reduce the number of deaths. Flood defence is also an area that requires improvement, as rising sea levels will leave coastal areas at serious risk from storm surges. Researchers also believe climate research and adaptation plans should be given more priority.","Study says severe weather will affect billions in North America and Eurasia .

At least seven current and former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were arrested Monday by the FBI as part of an ongoing investigation of inmate abuse in the nation's largest jail system. A law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the arrests who wasn't authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity confirmed the arrests of lower to mid-ranking deputies by federal agents. The official said no assistant sheriffs or undersheriff had been arrested. Federal authorities called a news conference Monday afternoon to announce criminal corruption and civil rights charges filed in the case. 'Corruprt': Nearly 20 sheriff's deputies have been hit with corruption and other charges . The FBI has been investigating allegations of excessive force and other misconduct at the county's jails since at least 2011. The official said the arrests were related to the abuse of individuals in the jail system and also allegations that sheriff's officials moved an FBI informant in the jails possibly to thwart their probe. Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said he was aware of an indictment but referred calls to the FBI. He said Sheriff Lee Baca would provide a comment later Monday afternoon. 'We've cooperated fully with the FBI in their investigation and we'll continue to do so,' Whitmore said. Massive: The Los Angeles County Jail is the largest county jail system in the entire country . Baca has acknowledged mistakes to a county commission reviewing reports of brutality, but he has also defended his department and distanced himself personally from the allegations. He said he's made improvements including creating a database to track inmate complaints. Baca has also hired a new head of custody and rearranged his command staff. Bad timing: The arrests come as Sheriff Lee Baca faces a tough re-election campaign . The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Sheriff's Department in 2012 claiming the sheriff and his top commanders had condoned violence against inmates. The organization released a report documenting more than 70 cases of misconduct by deputies. Last month the county announced the appointment of veteran Los Angeles County prosecutor Max Huntsman to head a new office of inspector general that will oversee the Sheriff's Department.","Federal investigators say the deputies abused inmates .

Once a week, Terri Roberts spends time with a 13-year-old Amish girl named Rosanna who sits in a wheelchair and eats through a tube. Roberts bathes her, sings to her, reads her stories. She can only guess what's going on inside Rosanna's mind because the girl can't talk. Roberts' son did this to her. Seven years ago, Charles Carl Roberts IV barricaded himself inside an Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, tied up 10 girls and opened fire, killing five and injuring five others before committing suicide as police closed in. Scroll down for video . Terri Roberts, mother of Charles Carl Roberts IV, the gunman in the Nickel Mines Amish School house massacre, works on her computer at her home in Strasburg, Pennsylvania. She shares her experience of the power of forgiveness with others . Funeral procession: The community was devastated by the multiple shootings in rural Pennsylvania in 2006 . The Amish responded by offering immediate forgiveness to the killer - even attending his funeral - and embracing his family. Terri Roberts forgave, too, and now she is sharing her experience with others, saying the world needs more stories about the power of forgiveness and the importance of seeking joy through adversity. 'I realized if I didn't forgive him, I would have the same hole in my heart that he had. And a root of bitterness never brings peace to anyone,' Roberts said. 'We are called to forgive.' Roberts has delivered the message to scores of audiences, from church groups to colleges, and is writing a memoir. She's even considered traveling to speak in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School last year. But she is cautious, mindful an appearance there could give offense. One of her sons is making a documentary - called Hope - about her remarkable journey from heartbroken mother to inspirational speaker. Members of the Amish community embracer in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, near the scene of a mass shooting incident at an Amish schoolhouse in 2006 . Charles Carl Roberts IV barricaded himself inside the Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster and opened fire, killing five girls and injuring five others before committing suicide as police closed in seven years ago . Zachary Roberts originally conceived the film to help his mother. But it's also proving to be cathartic for him. 'It was like a step toward getting this off my shoulders and being able to speak about it,' said Roberts, 35, who lives in Sweden. 'I have a kid now, and I don't want this to be one of those dark family secrets that nobody talks about. I want to be OK with it, and I want my daughter to be OK with it.' After filming on location in Pennsylvania, Zachary Roberts and the documentary's producers recently released a trailer and have turned to a crowd-funding website to raise money to complete production. Roberts appears in the trailer and doesn't mince words about the challenge that faced his mother after his 32-year-old brother's rampage: 'How does the mother of a mass murderer move forward in life?' Terri Roberts' path toward healing and reconciliation began, surprisingly enough, that very first afternoon. Her . husband, Chuck, had wiped away so many tears that he'd rubbed his skin . raw. The retired police officer hung his head, inconsolable. 'I will never face my Amish friends again,' he said, over and over. Terri Roberts (left), mother of school shooter Charles Carl Roberts IV (right), volunteers in helping a girl who was left in a wheelchair with a feeding tube because of her son's actions . An Amish neighbor named Henry told him otherwise. 'Roberts, we love you. We don't hold anything against you or your son,' Terri Roberts recalled Henry saying as he massaged Roberts' slumped shoulders. 'We're a forgiving people.' It was an extraordinary gesture, one that gave Terri Roberts her first glimmer of hope. She calls Henry her 'angel in black'. That same day, a counselor helped her realize that 'we do not need to live in our sorrow'. Her son's rampage was one part of his life, a terrible snapshot, the counselor said. Better to focus on all the good years. Coming . to terms with tragedy: Marie Roberts Monville was married to Charles . Roberts when he shot dead five girls in an Amish schoolhouse and injured . five others seven years ago . 'I can't tell you what that did for me. That was just so helpful for me, and I feel now that it's helped many other people,' Roberts said. Charlie Roberts said in suicide notes and a last call with his wife that he was tormented by unsubstantiated memories of having molested a couple of young relatives and by the death of his daughter in 1997, shortly after she was born. His mother first shared her story nine months after the October 2, 2006, slayings at West Nickel Mines Amish School, when a friend from work asked her to speak to some Japanese exchange students.Â  The message resonated, and Roberts said she felt a calling from God. Roberts remains close with Charlie . Roberts' wife, Marie Monville, who is also breaking her silence with a . book, One Light Still Shines, which shares a similar message of hope . amid despair. Like her former mother-in-law, Monville has relied on her Christian faith to carry her through the worst time in her life. 'The . message of the book is that it doesn't matter how dark the day is, the . love of the Lord continues, and he is capable of writing a redemption . story over our lives even in those dark places,' said Monville, who has . since remarried. She said . God has given her 'healing and freedom from the weight of Charlie's . choices and from the words, ''the shooter's wife,'' that tried to define . who I was.' A Pennsylvania State Police officers holds a handout photo of Charles Carl Roberts IV in Nickel Mines shortly after the devastating school shooting in the tight-knit Amish community . The Amish were celebrated for how they responded to the massacre. Yet forgiveness doesn't always come easily or automatically, even for this Christian sect whose members are known for their plain dress and simple ways. Rosanna King's father, Christ King, said the Amish are like anyone else, with the same frailties and emotions. 'We hope that we have forgiven, but there actually are times that we struggle with that, and I have to ask myself, ''Have I really forgiven?''' King said. 'We have a lot of work to do to live up to what we are bragged up to be,' he continued. 'Everyone was talking about this forgiveness thing, and I felt that was putting a lot of weight on our shoulders to live up to that.' Rosanna wasn't expected to survive after being shot in the head. She laughs, cries and responds to stimuli, and King said she is mentally alert. But she requires constant care. Terri Roberts' weekly visits with Rosanna force her to confront the damage her son caused. But Roberts also finds peace as she spends time with Rosanna and provides some relief to the teen's family, if only for a few hours. 'Beautiful young woman, but life is not as it should've been for this little girl. So my mind will never forget the hardship that day has caused in many people's lives,' Roberts said. 'And yet,' she said, 'none of us needs to live in the saddest part of our lives 24/7.'","Terri Roberts spends time with one girl whom her son shot in the head, leaving her in a wheelchair and unable to communicate .

Violent dramas on the broadcast networks carry milder parental cautions than cable shows like 'The Walking Dead' but can equal them in graphic gore, a new study found. Scenes of stabbings, shootings, rape, decapitation and mutilation invariably received a TV-14 'parents strongly cautioned' rating on network TV, according to the Parents Television Council study released Monday. But similar fare on cable typically was given the most stringent label, TV-MA for mature audiences only, researchers for the media watchdog group found. Dead man walking: A 'walker' from AMC's The Walking Dead, a zombie-like creature regularly put to death in creatively bloody ways . 'There are zero-point-zero series rated TV-MA on broadcast,' said the media watchdog council President Tim Winter, despite programs that are awash in violent scenes.It is vital to examine the media's effect on children and real-world violence, Winter said, adding that he hopes his nonpartisan group's findings are part of a wide-ranging search for solutions. Mystery drama: Nicole Beharie (as Abbie Mills, left) and Tom Mison (as Ichabod Crane) in a scene from 'Sleepy Hollow' Episode ratings are decided by networks and cable channels, similar to how the movie studios' Motion Picture Association of America self-governs by issuing its own movie ratings. The TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board, which is composed of TV industry members and public interest advocates, checks for ratings uniformity and responds to public complaints. It received 38 complaints in the past year.The ratings system 'serves as a valuable resource for parents and helps them make responsible viewing decisions based on what is appropriate for their own families. The industry regularly reviews the TV ratings to ensure they continue to be useful to parents,' Missi Tessier, spokeswoman for the board's executive secretariat, said in response to the PTC study. Horror show: This scene from 'American Horror Story: Coven' shows Denis O'Hare as Spalding before a violent death . NBC, CBS, Fox and CW did not comment on the study, which did not include any ABC shows. Under political and social pressure in the mid-1990s, the voluntary system was established by the TV industry to be used with the so-called V-chip that can block shows electronically. Networks find it financially vital to avoid applying TV-MA ratings, Winters said, which scare off advertisers. To assess how the ratings are used, the PTC said it analyzed the seven shows each on cable and broadcast TV that had the highest levels of violence. Each show's first four episodes of the 2012-13 season were analyzed. TV-14 warns that a program may include intense violence, sex or language not suitable for children under 14, while TV-MA is intended for shows that might have indecent language, graphic violence or explicit sexuality, according to the TV Parental Guidelines webpage. Fair rating: Cable shows like AMC's Walking Dead (pictured) receive a rating of mature audiences only, while shows on networks rate similar fare TV-14 . The PTC study defined graphic as 'especially vivid, brutal and realistic acts of violence' that are explicitly depicted. Among the network examples cited:- A bar fight scene on NBC's 'Revolution' in which a character wields a sword and a dagger to slash open one man's chest, cut another's neck and stab a third in the chest. The blood-spattered character pulls his sword from the last victim's body.- CW's 'Supernatural,' in which a trail of blood leads to the bodies of two priests impaled on a cemetery's wrought-iron fence. Their eyes have been gouged out and blood drips down their faces.- A woman is tortured in captivity, with an implanted camera sending images of her agony online in an episode of CBS' 'Criminal Minds.' An FBI agent watches as a hammer is driven into the victim's head. Bloody: In episode three of season nine, a trail of blood leads to the mutilated corpses of two priests on CW's 'Supernatural' Graphic: The study found that network TV such as CW's 'Supernatural,' pictured, can be just as violent as cable network but carries milder ratings . Depictions of shootings, stabbings and dismemberment were found on cable shows including AMC's 'The Walking Dead' and 'Breaking Bad' and FX's 'Sons of Anarchy.' Five of the seven cable shows had TV-MA ratings, with 'Walking Dead' eventually switching from TV-14 to MA. Other broadcast shows in the study included NBC's 'The Blacklist,' Fox's 'Sleepy Hollow,' CBS' 'CSI' and NBC's 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.' Although administered differently, movie ratings have also been criticism for being soft on violence. A study last month found the number of scenes featuring gun violence in PG-13 movies has come to rival or surpass the rate of such action in R-rated projects. The PTC's Winter said his group's study, taken together with the movie report, 'starts to weave together a fabric that urgently needs a public response.'","Violent shows on network TV carries milder parental cautions than those on cable .

Swiss drug-maker Novartis has started supplying a new meningitis B vaccine to thousands of Princeton University students in an effort to stop an outbreak at the Ivy League campus, despite the shot not yet licensed for use in the United States. The vaccine - which is called Bexsero and is available in Europe, Australia and Canada - has been imported in and will be administered to a total of about 5000 undergraduate students and 550 graduate students in dorms at the New Jersey campus this week after receiving permission from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The green light follows eight university students being diagnosed with the serogroup B strain of meningitis, a potentially fatal infection that causes swelling of the brain and spinal cord and can kill within 24 hours. A meningitis vaccine approved for use in Europe and Australia but not in the United States has been imported to try and stop an outbreak of the disease at Princeton University in New Jersey, federal health officials have said . A Department of Health employee prepares a meningitis vaccine. Students have been diagnosed with a strand of the infection on college campuses on both the East and West coasts, requiring an unapproved vaccine to be imported and immediately distributed . Meningitis B vaccine Bexsero, created by Swiss company Novartis, has been approved for use in Europe, Australia and Canada but not the United States. It will be distributed to over 5000 students at Princeton University in New Jersey to prevent an infection outbreak . Across the country, at the University of California in Santa Barbara, at least four students have been reported as infected by meningitis B in the past month, including an 18-year-old freshman lacrosse player whose feet had to be amputated after complications from the illness. Aaron Loy is recovering slowly following the drastic surgery. 'His overall body and various wounds continue to heal with his daily regimen of nutrition, therapy and rest,' his family said on Friday. 'His next surgery is scheduled for early next week. Aaronâs spirits and commitment to return to UCSB are remarkable.' Other students who were hospitalized are recovering, health officials at both Princeton and UCSB told NBC News, without divulging details. Loyâs condition underscores the threat of meningitis infections, which are rare but very serious â especially among teens and young adults â killing 1 in 10 of those affected and leaving about 20 percent of those who survive with severe disabilities, including limb loss, deafness and mental retardation. University of California freshmen Aaron Loy, 18, has had his feet amputated after being sickened in a meningitis outbreak at UC Santa Barbara. Family say his condition is improving but remains hospitalized in San Diego . Friends of Aaron Loy write him 'get well soon' messages after the 18-year-old lacrosse player had both amputated due to complications with a meningitis infection . The infection is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk. Young adults and individuals with certain medical conditions have an increased risk of meningitis, especially when living in close proximity to one another. Meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges. Infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation, according to the CDC. The first dose of the Princeton vaccine will be available this week; a second dose in February. For maximum protection, individuals must receive two doses. A free meningitis vaccine will be distributed among students at Princeton University in New Jersey this week . Princeton have said they will cover the cost of the vaccine. Novartis has completed Phase I and Phase II trials for the vaccine in the United States and is in discussions with regulators about the path to approval. The drug-maker is hoping Bexsero will turn around its vaccine business, which has lost money to research and spending cash in the first nine months of the year. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States, according to the CDC. Of those, 160 were group B.","Eight Princeton University students have been diagnosed with the B strain of meningitis .

Officials . delayed information about the letter so it could be thoroughly analyzed . in order to be certain that it was actually written by the teenager. Law enforcement officials say that although the letter has given them fresh hope, they fear deeply for Miss Hernandez's safety. Zenya Hernandez said that she is relieved for every day that does not bring bad news about her missing daughter Abigail . One . FBI investigator suggested that Abigail could face a similar danger to . the young women in Cleveland, Ohio who escaped after being held for ten . years by Ariel Castro. The content of the letter or where it was postmarked was not revealed today as police fear copycats could send letters that would hamper the investigation. Abigail was last seen on Wednesday, October 9, leaving Kennett High School in North Conway. Police . said she walked her normal route home and sent several texts to a . friend between 2:30 and 3pm.

The mother of missing teen Abigail, Zenya Hernandez, center, and her daughter, Sarah listen as Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young speaks during a news conference on Friday . Ms Young said: 'This is a child. She was 14 when she disappeared and had her 15th birthday a few days later.' She added that the missing girl has no source of income, so someone is helping her 'whether that is a friend or what we fear is a foe'. FBI investigator Kieran Ramsey said that they feared although Abby may have left willingly, she was now being coerced or manipulated. Since her disappearance, Miss Hernandez's parents have made repeated public pleas for her safe return - even stating in a televised interview that they believe she got in a car with someone and that they believe she is in serious trouble. Her mother Zenya and sister Sarah appeared at the press conference on Friday but did not address the cameras. Ms Young said that Zenya was 'frail' due to the ordeal and requested that the family be given privacy. Incentive: The FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information in the missing person case . The girlâs mother said last month that she believes her daughter will come home someday. Zenya Hernandez urged her daughter to be strong. Police have said they donât know whether Abigail was involved in an accident, ran away or was abducted. 'I miss you and love you more than . you can imagine,' Zenya Hernandez said in her note written on a yellow . legal pad and dated November 22.Â  'I feel your absence every day.

Although investigators think that Abby may have left willingly, she may now be being coerced or manipulated . New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said investigators are still working the case and that it is important to keep Abby's picture in the media -- especially outside of the local area. âAbby, I keep having a dream where you come home and I give you the biggest hug ever,â she wrote in her letter. âI know in my heart this dream means something and that it matters. I pray to God it will come true.â The letter was signed, ' Love, Mom,' with a little heart drawn on the page. During a press conference held last month in front of the Conway Police Department, Miss Hernandez addressed her daughter, saying she believed Abby was out there somewhere watching her right now. In an interview with CBS Boston, Miss Hernandez said Abby usually took the bus home, but for some reason decided to walk October 9. State and Conway police and the FBI have been inundated with hundreds of tips. The FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case, Boston.com reported. The last call made on a missing New Hampshire girlâs cellphone was October 9 about four hours after she was last seen, investigators said. Police, FBI, New Hampshire Fish and Game personnel and volunteers have all helped to search for the teenager but have not found any leads . The last sighting of the girl, who ran on the track team for her school and was described as quiet and bright, was around 2.30pm. Investigators believe Abigail made it back to her home, but when her mother came back from her nursing job, her daughter was gone. The schoolgirl's 15th birthday was on October 12. Police said they have not located the girlâs phone, but have determined that the last call was made at 6.30pm - about four hours after her last sighting. It was used about two miles from her home at a spot near Cranmore Mountain - a popular local ski resort. Since then local police and the FBI have searched on foot, in boats, and by helicopter but have failed to turn up any new evidence about the disappearance. Abigail is 5ft 4in tall and weighs 118lb with brown hair and eyes. She was last seen wearing black stretch pants, tall brown boots and a grey sweater.

It may not be the world's greatest problem but jabbing at computer ports, when trying to insert USB cables that are almost always the wrong way up, can be very annoying. However, this frustrating pitfall of modern life is set to become a thing of the past as work has begun on the next generation of reversible USB connectors â making it possible to insert a plug into a socket both ways up. The new USB Type-C connector is being designed to be used in thinner and sleeker products like tablets and ultrabooks. Inserting a USB plug (pictured) into a port the right way up can be annoying but work has begun on a new generation of USB connector called the Type-C that will be reversible . The design has not yet been revealed but its plug will be approximately the same size as a Micro USB plug. The idea is that the Type-C âis the only connector one will need across all devicesâ according to the USB 3.0 Promoter Group. Crucially, as the new design is different to the current and old USB plugs, users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use new devices or Type-C plugs. Brad Saunders, chairman of the group, said the plug is being developed âto help enable thinner and sleeker product designs, enhance usability and provide a growth path for performance enhancements for future versions of USB.â The Type-C connector is built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies and will be reversible like Appleâs Lightning connector. Jabbing at computer ports, when trying to insert USB cables that are almost always the wrong way up, can be very annoying. But this activity could become a thing of the past as the next-generation USB connector will be reversible, like Apple's Lightning connector . The design is expected to be finalised by the middle of 2014. Alex Peleg of Intel said the company âis excited to see the development of the new thin Type-C connector as it will enable an entirely new super thin class of devices from phones to tablets, to 2-in-1s, to laptops to desktops and a multitude of other more specific usage devices.â âThis new industry standards-based thin connector delivering data, power and video is the only connector one will need across all devices,â he added.","The new USB Type-C connector is currently being designed to be used in thinner and sleeker products such as tablets and ultrabooks .

Alex Rodriguez sensationally walked out of his grievance hearing on Wednesday slamming a table and shouting 'this is f****** bull****' at MLB Chief Operating Officer Rob Manfred as he walked out. The final straw for the New York Yankees third baseman was when arbitrator Fredric Horowitz refused to order baseball Commissioner Bud Selig to testify. Horowitz was in the midst of the 11th day of hearings on the grievance filed by the players' association to overturn the 211-game suspension given to Rodriguez by Major League Baseball last summer for alleged violations of the sport's drug agreement and labor contract. Alex Rodriguez (pictured on Monday) stormed out of his grievance hearing on Wednesday after arbitrator Fredric Horowitz refused to order baseball Commissioner Bud Selig to testify . 'I am disgusted with this abusive process, designed to ensure that the player fails,' Rodriguez said in a statement afterwards. 'I have sat through 10 days of testimony by felons and liars, sitting quietly through every minute, trying to respect the league and the process. 'This morning, after Bud Selig refused to come in and testify about his rationale for the unprecedented and totally baseless punishment he hit me with, the arbitrator selected by MLB and the players' association refused to order Selig to come in and face me. 'The absurdity and injustice just became too much. I walked out and will not participate any further in this farce.' Critics suggest A-Rod's walk-out could have been a deliberate move staged so that he can avoid having to take the witness stand (pictured on Monday) Rodriguez's legal team remains involved in the proceeding, although it is unclear whether Rodriguez will testify. The reference to âfelons and liarsâ was an apparent reference to MLBâs chief witness against him, Tony Bosch, the former owner of Biogenesis, who is alleged to have supplied Rodriguez with multiple banned substances over a three year period. MLB responded with its own statement, in which it defended its collectively bargained and binding arbitration process. 'For more than 40 years, Major League Baseball and the Players Association have had a contractual grievance process to address disputes between the two parties. This negotiated process has served players and clubs well. 'Despite Mr. Rodriguez being upset with one of the arbitration panel's rulings today, Major League Baseball remains committed to this process and to a fair resolution of the pending dispute.' There is one line of thinking that the walkout may have been calculated to give Rodriguezâs team the alibi it needs to explain why he wonât take the witness stand in his own defense and go under oath about his relationship with Bosch and Biogenesis, reports The Daily News. A-Rod stormed out of the hearing on Wednesday after being informed that Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig would not be ordered to testify . A day earlier, Yankees President Randy Levine testified and denied conspiring with MLB on A-Rod's suspension. Levine was asked a series of questions by Rodriguez lawyer Joseph Tacopina. He testified for 10-15 minutes and denied having any personal gain from Rodriguez's suspension or the Yankees falling under the luxury tax threshold; and of having an agreement to receive a commission of any money the team saved because of the ban. Levine also denied discussing Rodriguez's discipline with Major League Baseball or Selig and telling Rodriguez surgeon Dr. Bryan Kelly or anyone else that he wanted the player off the field. Levine testified that he may have jokingly used the phrase 'is he off the juice?' when talking with Rodriguez about other players who weren't performing. Levine testified he had no exact recollection. The hearing resumed on Monday before Horowitz, who also heard the case from Sept. 30-Oct. 3 and Oct. 15-18. MLBâs star witness Tony Bosch, left, and MLB Chief Operating Officer Rob Manfred, right . Howard Gans, a lawyer for MLB, said in papers filed in federal court that Horowitz will hear the case daily through Nov. 26 rather than the original plan to recess after Friday and resume Dec. 16. MLB said U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan issued an order on Tuesday compelling Michael Sitrick, head of the public relations firm Sitrick & Co., to comply with a Sept. 19 subpoena issued by Horowitz to appear at the arbitration and to provide documents. Sitrick & Co. worked on Rodriguez's behalf earlier this year. In papers filed in the New York Supreme Court on Oct. 29, MLB alleged Sitrick & Co. had provided records from Bosch to Yahoo Sports, which published a story Feb. 5 saying the name of 2011 NL MVP Ryan Braun appeared in records of Biogenesis of America, the Florida anti-aging clinic accused of distributing banned performance-enhancing drugs. MLB said in the court papers it believed the documents had been 'provided to Sitrick & Co. by Rodriguez or others acting on his behalf.' A-Rod was hit with a massive 211-game suspension by Major League Baseball last summer for alleged violations of the sport's drug agreement and labor contract . Miami New Times had reported on Jan. 29 that Rodriguez bought human growth hormone and other performance-enhancing substances from Biogenesis during 2009-12. Sitrick's lawyers, who had the matter removed to federal court, did not respond to an email seeking comment on Ramos' order, which MLB said was read from the bench. Braun agreed on July 22 to a season-ending 65-game suspension. Rodriguez was suspended Aug. 5 for alleged violations of the sport's drug agreement and labor contract, and the players' union filed the grievance to overturn the penalty. Under baseball's drug agreement, he was allowed to continue playing while contesting the discipline. The three-time AL MVP said four years ago he used PEDs while with the Texas Rangers from 2001-03, but has denied using them since. At the time of his suspension, MLB said the penalty was for 'use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including testosterone and human growth hormone over the course of multiple years' and for 'engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the office of the commissioner's investigation.'","Rodriguez sensationally walked out of grievance hearing on Wednesday morning, swearing and slamming a table as he left .

Father McFalls recognises his decision will be a 'disappointment' to his congregation . McFalls has been given an indefinite leave of absence by the Bishop at the head of his Diocese . Now one member of his congregations has said she is glad he is gone, calling him 'flirty.' Diana Garcia, who has attended the church for 15 years, told Fox News: 'Heâs gone after girls before and heâs gone after my daughters.' 'Heâs just lustful, he didnât say he was in love or marry the girl, no. 'Itâs not about being a sinner, itâs about playing with God, he made a vow, this is a priest weâre talking about.' In a letter sent to the church and read to his congregation, McFalls said: 'A child will soon be born, and I am the babyâs father. I know this comes as a shock to you, and to many a disappointment. 'I assume full responsibility for my actions and will do all that I can so that my child receives the care and love that he deserves.

Jack Valero, a spokesman for Catholic Voices, said: 'It is a very very sad thing to happen. It is the same as if a married man is unfaithful to his wife. St. Mary of The Assumption Parish will have to find a new priest after the sudden resignation . On its website the church still lists Daniel McFalls as its Pastor . 'He made a commitment and he did not stick to it. It undermines priests commitment to chastity.' Priests make their vows for life, so while McFalls will no longer serve his community, he could serve other communities and continue to perform priestly duties, such as marrying people, unless he volunteers to 'laicise' himself. Laicisation is an official process carried out by The Holy See in Rome to effectively 'unmake' a Catholic priest. Priests do not have to laicise themselves following sexual relations, as with adulterous husbands who may wish to continue being married. The process is uncommon, though has peaked in recent times following the Catholic child abuse scandal.","Parishioner says he was always flirting and had gone after her daughters .

The lack of border checks on private planes landing in Britain may be allowing organised crime bosses to fly in and out of Britain with impunity, MPs warned last night. The chairman of an influential committee in Parliament warned that the failure of border officials to conduct passport and other checks on small aircraft could be âletting billionaire gangsters off the hookâ. Labour MP Margaret Hodge made her warning in a damning report about failures at the Border Force - a Home Office agency tasked with protecting Britainâs borders. Warning: Margaret Hodge, Labour Party Member of Parliament and chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee. A Damning report about failures at the Border Force has been released . The Public Accounts Committeeâs report into Border Force found staff shortages meant freight coming in to the countryâs sea and air ports went unchecked - potentially allowing in illicit goods and illegal immigrants. It also warned: . :: A major IT system, the Warnings Index, used to stop terrorists and criminals from getting in to Britain is âat risk of collapseâ. :: Staff had been fired, paid off lump sums in redundancy and then re-hired when crisis hit. :: Nearly forty per cent of passengers are not screened in advance of landing . Mrs Hodge said Border Force was unable to meet and check up to 90,000 private planes and private boats arriving in the UK each year - leaving the UK border âvulnerableâ. Known as âgeneral aviationâ this sector has long been a concern as a possible route into Britain for drugs, illegal migrants and organised criminals. The report found huge gaps in the data the agency receives on people landing private planes or boats in Britain. The report said: âThe information the Border Force receives on incoming private planes and boats is notably poor, and there is concern that those able to access private planes and boats can evade border checks. âThe intelligence alerts to frontline Border Force staff on potential threats are of limited utility as they are generated from cross-checking data on legacy systems not designed for this purpose.â Border Force was hived off as a separate agency 18 months ago after it emerged passengers were being waved through without proper checks to keep airport delays to a minimum. Mrs Hodge said Border Force was unable to meet and check up to 90,000 private planes and private boats . But the report warned there was âlittle evidenceâ since then of progress in tackling existing problems. MPs also criticised the agency for âtoo readilyâ using national security as an excuse for not providing information to the committee or the National Audit Office. It found the agency had cut staff numbers by 500 between 2010 and last year but then increased front line numbers by 400 when new checks were imposed. âPaying out redundancy and then rehiring staff is bad value for money and demonstrates poor planningâ, the report said. Mrs Hodge said: âThe Border Force prioritised passenger checks on arrival at the expense of other duties and weakened the security of our borders. âThe force neglected to examine freight for illicit goods, neglected to check lorries in Calais for concealed illegal entrants, and failed to check passengers coming into Britain on private planes or boats, potentially letting billionaire gangsters off the hook. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: âBorder Force was split from the UK Border Agency last year to create a separate command with a clear security and law enforcement ethos. âIt is making significant improvements in its performance - excessive queues at airports are gone and security strengthened. This extends to both passengers and goods and is underpinned, for the first time, by a clear Operating Mandate set by ministers. âIt will take time to transform Border Force and fix all the problems we inherited but I am confident that we are making the right changes. None of the issues raised in this report come as a surprise and they are already being actively addressed.â","Labour MP Margaret Hodge made her warning in a damning report .

I am not going to live a lie any more. âThe reaction was, mostly, incredibly supportive. âA handful of letters spoke more loudly of the sender than the recipient. My staff shielded me from the worst examples of intolerance, bile and hatred. âTheir message contained not a scintilla of understanding or know-ledge of the open and hidden battles that so many people face in their daily lives. âThere are the many youngsters who are constantly bullied at school or work because people know or suspect that they are gay. The relentless harassment destroys their lives and in some cases ends tragically in suicide.â Glamour role: Mr Evans with visiting dancers at the House of Commons . Born in Swansea in 1957, Mr Evans was educated at Dynevor School, a grammar which converted to a comprehensive during his time there. After studying for a politics degree at Swansea University, Mr Evans started his working life helping out at his familyâs newsagents shops, before embarking on his political career as a local councillor. He was defeated in three Commons Elections in the space of one Parliamentary term â Swansea West at the 1987 General Election, at the Pontypridd by-election in 1989 and the Ribble Valley by-election in 1991 â before finally taking his current seat at the 1992 Election. âAfter decades of denying it to myself, . and then just denying it to others, I didnât want to continue living a . fraction of my life.â Nigel Evans MP . He was quickly talent-spotted by William Hague who made him his Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1996, when Mr Hague was Welsh Secretary. Mr Evans was briefly a party frontbencher when he served as Shadow Welsh Secretary under Iain Duncan Smith between 2001 and 2003, returning to the backbenches after Michael Howard took over the Tory leadership. Since becoming Deputy Speaker, after the 2010 Election, he has impressed colleagues with his handling of Commons debates: his good-humoured approach is preferred by many MPs to John Bercowâs more abrasive style. Some said Mr Evans was in prime position to succeed Mr Bercow when he stands down. Master of ceremonies: Deputy speaker Nigel Evans dressed as a ringmaster while hosting a Commons reception for the circus industry . Last month, Mr Evans made clear his respect for Margaret Thatcher by mounting a strong defence of the cost of the funeral arrangements for the former Prime Minister. He rebuked the Bishop of Grantham for suggesting the event could be a focus for ugly protests, insisting Britain excelled at âpomp and ceremonyâ. He also heaped praise on Lady Thatcherâs granddaughter Amanda for her calm and collected reading at the funeral in St Paulâs. Mr Evans said: âIf she had been speaking at just a family funeral people can break down and cry, but her composure was perfect.â Mr Evans told movingly in 2009 how his mother Betty died from a superbug infection after a routine operation in an NHS hospital, writing: âThe last, harrowing moments of my motherâs life will live for ever in the collective memory of my family. 'An 86-year-old lady of infinite grace and dignity, she had the most agonising of deaths.â He blamed the tragedy on a âmixture of neglect, incompetence and indifference shown by the NHSâ before adding: âIf she had been cared for properly, if the ward had been cleaner or greater urgency had been shown in handling her case, then this tragedy might never have happened.â Mr Evans â who enjoys regular foreign trips as part of his duties â made a characteristic appearance in the gossip columns two years ago when involved in a good-humoured, late-night exchange with police after pulling up to the Commons gates in a tourist rickshaw. He made a futile attempt to persuade them to waive security rules so he could ride on to theÂ  Parliamentary estate to collect the driverâs fare. He was last spotted at the Commons on Thursday evening, cheerfully waving to colleagues as he loaded up his Saab convertible before driving to his constituency.

After their high street's Christmas tree was dubbed the worst in Britain, residents of Stockton Town Centre were left feeling a little less festive than others. So, in a bid to restore the community's Christmas spirit, a local pub landlord decided to put up his own fir near the council's effort, which has been likened to 'an upside down cornet'. But within hours of erecting the improved tree, council officials were on site to tear it down after branding it a 'health and safety hazard.' Scroll down for video . Pub landlord Craig Harker worked tirelessly with local children to put up the tree outside his pub in Stockton . Craig Harker was left mortified by the attention the town's tree had received, with some critics slamming it as a 'disgrace'. With the help of some local children, the 26-year-old decided to put up a real Christmas fir, complete with tinsel, baubles and beads. The 26-year-old was among countless residents who were left red-faced by the council's effort . But despite being admired by customers at The George Pub, the tree was swiftly taken away on the back ofÂ  a JCB by council workers who deemed it 'dangerous'. Mr Harker said: 'A bar worker saw the council workers driving away with the tree and she called me. 'She was too late to do anything about it, as they were already leaving when she saw them.' Though the pub was open at the time, Mr Harker claims no one bothered to tell staff the tree was to be removed. 'When I rang the council I was told that it had blown over and that it was a health and safety hazard,' he added. The landlord wasn't the only local resident who was left red-faced by the council's 'tree' which was likened to a dunce's hat and wigwam by passers-by. 'It's not good for the town to get such publicity, I wanted to do something positive. 'I am devastated, I don't understand why they could not have just spoken to me about it.' 'It meant a lot to me, I was running round trying to sort out the buying of the tree while by partner was in hospital with our newborn baby.' Mr Harker has even offered to gift the tree to the council so they can put it back up, but is waiting for a response. Stockton Council has said it received a report that the tree had blown over - and that workers took it away on Monday morning 'while making efforts to establish who owns it.' The council has since tweeted that it is talking to Mr Harker, but did not indicate whether the tree would be reinstated. All that remains: Craig Harker is 'devastated' that the council removed his Christmas tree . Councillor Bob Cook, Leader of Stockton Council, said: 'The tree was blown over during the early hours, narrowly missing a passer-by. 'Thankfully nobody was injured but I think the CCTV footage speaks for itself really â this is not a case of the council overreacting, more a case of being sensible in light of the windy conditions. 'Our staff recovered the tree after a report that it had been propped up against a barrier.' 'Embarrassment': Residents were horrified by the council's white, cone-shaped Christmas tree . Stockton Council was not available for a comment this evening. Last week the town's tree was lambasted as the country's worst, with critics comparing it to an upside down cornet and dunce's hat. Local residents were dismayed by the effort, with some saying they would take their children and grandchildren elsewhere to see the Christmas lights being switched on.","Stockton Town Centre was blasted for having Britain's worst Christmas tree .

Facing jail: Edward Alexander Somerset subjected his wife to more than two decades of abuse, a court heard yesterday . An aristocrat from one of Britainâs grandest families is facing jail after subjecting his wife to more than two decades of domestic abuse. Edward Alexander Somerset â a son of the 11th Duke of Beaufort â kicked his wife CarolineÂ  and pulled her hair while affected by âdrink or drugs or bothâ, a courtÂ  heard yesterday. Lady Edward suffered bruising and a dislocated finger during the 22 years of violence. The couple, who have two grown-up daughters, are now divorcing after three decades of marriage. Yesterday Somerset, 55, admitted four counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Looking gaunt and unshaven, he wore a dark blue suit with a red tie, pocket handkerchief and silver earring as he spoke clearly to plead guilty to the charges. Somerset admitted attacking his wife at the home they shared on the 52,000-acre Badminton Estate in Gloucestershire â home of the world-famous Badminton Horse Trials â and in France. His lawyer William Clegg QC told Bristol Crown Court: âBetween 1990 and 2011 there were incidents of violence between the two, often in drunk or drugs or both, whereby the complainant received injuries. They included scratches and hair pulls.â Judge Mark Horton, who will sentence the father-of-two in February, told the aristocrat the offences were so serious a prison sentence was possible. The estranged couple have not seen each other for a year and divorce proceedings are set to be finalised in the near future. He will also consider whether a restraining order to protect Somerset's wife from her estranged husband should be put in place. 'At this stage, I am unable to say a custodial sentence would not follow,' the judge told Somerset. 'Given that this reflects a substantial period of domestic violence, this is a case where I should like the defendant to meet with a probation officer.' Judge Horton said the guilty pleas reflected a 'different picture' to how Somerset, referred to simply as Edward Somerset in court, had described the case during police interview. Split: Somerset and his wife Caroline are pictured on their wedding day at Badminton House in 1982, left, and at a fancy dress party, right for Mick Jagger's 50th birthday, right . Treatment: It is understood that one of the recent alleged incidents left his wife hospitalised . Luxury: The attacks happened on the sprawling Badminton Estate in Gloucestershire where the couple lived . 'It doesnât appear to me from having . read it that he had quite appreciated the seriousness of the domestic . violence in his marriage. 'As . I see it, there has been quite a dramatic period where things should . they have been approached differently, might have prevented this . violence to the complainant in this case.' He admitted a 'deliberate and hard' kick to his wife at Essex House on the Badminton Estate between January 1 2011 and November 29 2011. The aristocrat, who has no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to two further assaults, where he bruised his wife in October last year. Somerset also admitted assaulting his wife on numerous occasions between January 1990 and December 2011, giving her a variety of injuries including a bruise, scratches and pulled hair. His guilty plea for that charge, covering a 22-year period, represented 'incidents of violence between the two, often in drink or drugs or both'Â  the court heard. Case: Bristol Crown Court heard the incidents of violence between the two often involved drink or drugs . Appearance: The 55-year-old was released on conditional bail and will return to court on February 6 . Prosecuting, Eleanor Laws QC, said Somersetâs wife feared him and was seeking a restraining order. 'She . would say she still has fears of this defendant because of his . offending and she is in a very emotional state,' Miss Laws said. 'While . she says there has been no real direct contact between the two of them . there is evidence that the defendantâs elder brother, working, so it . would seem, on behalf of the defendantâs father, had contacted the . complainantâs cousin, Lord Raleigh, and arranged a meeting in October, . during which there was a discussion about finances, dropping the case, . paying for advice for the complainant. The Badminton Estate lies in the heart of the Gloucestershire countryside and is home to the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort. TheÂ  Duke of Beaufort title was created by Charles II in 1682 for Henry Somerset, the 3rd Marquess of Worcester. The . family are descendants in the male line from the French dynasty, the . House of Plantagenet, through John of Gaunt and Edward III. The sprawling estate dates back to the 17th century and is where the game of Badminton was invented in 1863. Lord . Somerset and his wife lived in the grade-two-listed Essex House, an . 18th-century building which stands at the village's entrance. He . is the third of four children of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, 85 year-old . David Somerset, who is estimated to be worth Â£135 million. His eldest brother Henry John Fitzroy, Marquess of Worcester, 60, is heir to the estate and title. 'It was this meeting which she found . out about and got to hear what was discussed which devastated her and . put her under considerable stress in the run up to this trial.' Miss . Laws said there was 'nothing to suggest' Somerset had been behind the . meeting but was the 'sort of conduct' his wife was 'vulnerable to'. Representing Somerset, William Clegg QC, said his client would not oppose a restraining order. 'The two havenât seen each other for over a year,' he said. 'Lord Somersetâs view as far as a restraining order is concerned is that he would be perfectly happy to have such an order imposed. 'He accepts his marriage is completely over. He thinks it by far the best that he have no contact with the complainant, and she has no contact with him. 'I have no instructions from the Duke or his brother.' Mr Clegg said divorce proceedings between Somerset and Caroline are 'at a stage where hopefully things can be finalised between them'. 'The children are now at an age where they can make their own way between their parents,' Mr Clegg said. Judge Horton released Somerset on conditional bail after advising him to be 'frank with the reality of what has taken place' during the marriage with the probation service. 'The court looks forward to seeing you again on the 6th of February,' the judge added. A charge of assault causing actual bodily harm carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment, according to sentencing guidelines.

An independent adoption agency desperate to find children a home has resorted to advertising them in local newspapers. Adoptionplus placed full page adverts in three newspapers in Cambridgeshire in a bid to find loving families for 'Liam', four, and 'Kevin', three. The advert appeals to would-be parents by saying the process of adoption has 'no cost, no waiting time, and no hoops to jump through.' Adoptionplus placed this full-page advert in three Cambridgeshire newspapers appealing to readers to find 'Luke' and 'Kevin' homes . It appeared in the Fenland Citizen, Cambridge News and Cambridge News and Crier, though the children featured are not thought to be local and have had their names changed. Joanne Alper, a service director at Adoptionplus, has defended . the adverts saying the company needed to find an 'imaginative' way to . encourage adoption, as the number of children looking for a home reached . 4,000. She said: 'Basically the situation is there are four . thousand children in the UK who need a family and a lot of authorities . are struggling to find them. 'There is a lot of pressure on them . to try and be a bit more creative. This advert is a new thing. It is us . trying something different and it is unusual. 'It is very easy when you just switch on the news and they say 'blah blah blah' but this kind of thing makes it seem more real. 'We just hope this could inspire interest. We try to get rid of myths like that you have to be in a relationship to adopt. 'I . think the fact that there are so many children in the UK that need a . home is desperately sad and we want to do everything we can.' But some have slammed the campaign . saying children should not be advertised in such a way that is . 'unconcerned' with finding them a suitable home. The agency that was commissioned by a local authority that cannot be named for legal reasons has defended the advert as 'an imaginative' way to find children homes . John . Hemmings MP said the advert sent out the wrong message and would not . serve the purpose of finding a safe home for vulnerable children. The . liberal democrat, who represents Birmingham Yardley, said: 'If parents . with children did something like that they would go to jail. 'We are supposed to protect the identity of children by not naming them or keeping their identity secret. John Hemming condemned the advert as 'unconcerned' with finding the children suitable homes . 'I . find it very odd that local authorities are so keen to keep a child's . identity secret one minute but then change their minds when it suits . them. 'They seem to be unconcerned about the household that children end up in. 'It is about box ticking rather than finding them a good home.' The independent agency was commissioned by a local authority, which cannot be named to protect the children's identities, to find the boys homes. Adoptionplus is monitored by watchdog Ofsted and was rated as Outstanding in five different categories in February this year. Staff were described as 'forward thinking' and praised for being 'extremely effective' in finding homes for vulnerable children. The British Association of Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) said they welcome new ways of encouraging prospective parents, adding: 'It's not something new to us as we are always trying to find ways of rehoming children.' 'We are very careful about where we feature children. We normally change their names or don't talk about location.

Homeowners could be bribed with compensation to accept unpopular new developments which devalue their properties. Planning Minister Nick Boles said pay-outs could âhelp people overcome their objectionsâ to projects such as nuclear power stations, rail links or industrial plants. He told MPs yesterday the proposal was a âradical departureâ from Britainâs current planning rules, but would help speed up major infrastructure that will boost growth. Planning Minister Nick Boles has proposed compensating homeowners into accepting unpopular new developments which devalue their properties (file picture) Mr Boles, well-known for his clashes with countryside campaigners over homebuilding, is likely to provoke controversy and accusations he is railroading people into accepting unpopular construction. But he told MPs on the Commons communities and local government committee he was determined there should be âindividual benefitsâ for local residents from new development. It would help speed up planning applications and cut down on legal bills, he said. There are already schemesÂ  to compensate homeowners for roads and rail links which affect the property by creating noise and traffic. However, Mr Boles is proposing direct compensation for lost property value, and to extend this to other types of development. He is looking for a place to carry out a pilot scheme in the coming months. He said: âI think that everybody . recognises that countries have to do difficult things â build roads, . build railway lines, build nuclear power stations and other kinds of . power sources. Planning Minister Nick Boles is looking for a place to carry out a pilot scheme in the coming months . 'It is better for everyone that the amount of money is banged up in the transaction process â making the decision, let alone building the thing, as little as possible and relatively speedy. With certain projects there has been a principle established of some kind of a benefit being paid to very local communities.â He added: âOne of the things we are keen to pilot is whether people who have properties very close to a substantial development might benefit from some form of compensation for the loss of property value, something that does happen in some other countries, the Netherlands have innovated with it. âItâs quite a radical departure for this country â itâs not totally clear how you graft it on to our planning system so thatâs why weâre going relatively carefully into it and looking to set up a pilot to see whether it can help people overcome their objections to developments that are of benefit to the local community but might have a negative impact on them personally.â The schemes are aimed at âimproving our energy security or improving our transport links or improving our national competitivenessâ. Under the Dutch system, a small number of people living close to proposed developments who can prove they have suffered âdetrimentâ receive compensation payments with an average payout of around Â£8,000. A report last year from The Infrastructure Forum,Â  recommending such a scheme in the UK, estimated it would cost Â£80million a year but the costs would be far outstripped by infrastructure benefits. It said: âIn Britain, at present, residents miles away from a development think they have everything to gain and nothing to lose by objecting to new roads, rail lines, housing or business development.â The Department for Transport is consulting on how to compensate people affected by the High Speed 2 rail line through buying their home or giving them a property bond. A source said of Mr Bolesâ idea: âIt sounds like thisÂ  proposal is going quite a bit further.âÂ  His plan emerged as the Energy Department looks at schemes to give individual homeowners cash or money off their energy bills to accept nearby wind farms.","Planning Minister said pay-outs could 'help people overcome objections'

The Prime Minister said the defence alliance remained âa relevant force fit for the 21st Centuryâ.

The alliance was set up in 1949, with the emergence of the Cold War. Ally: British Prime Minister David Cameron pictured with Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen outside 10 Downing Street . It continued as the Westâs main riposte against the threat of the Soviet Union and its satellite Communist states. But Natoâs relevance has been questioned with the decline of the Cold War. There have also been rows between members over a reluctance to militarily intervene in Syria. Foreign policy experts view the 2014 summit as the most important Nato meeting since the end of the Cold War. Dr Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society thinktank, said: âBy bringing the summit to the UK, the Prime Minister has clearly demonstrated that his commitment to Britainâs role in the world is unshaken, despite recent political difficulties over Syria. 'Hosting the summit is a clear signal that the Prime Minister and his Government fully intend to ensure Britain carries the burden of defending our values in a multipolar world, where those who do not share them are in the ascendancy. âThis is a vital summit, the stakes for which are very high. It will allow Britain to host what may well turn out to be the most crucial NATO summit since the Cold War.â The summit will also take place the same year as the Scottish independence referendum. Scottish nationalists want an independent Scotland to continue to be a Nato member. But the Scottish Governmentâs anti-nuclear stance puts it odds with Natoâs key defence strategy, which centres around keeping a nuclear deterrent.","Cameron to invite 28 leaders next year for 'crucial summit'

For Champagne to become the tipple it is today - popped at weddings, quaffed in casinos, sprayed by racing drivers and smashed against ships - a few men had to die. Not just any old men - young ones married to ambitious young women, without whom mankind's most seductive fizz would not be what it is now. One of the world's most famous Champagnes - Veuve (French for 'Widow') Clicquot - explicitly evokes the rather grim tradition. But other legendary houses - Bollinger, Laurent-Perrier and Pommery - also got their starts from tragedy-tinged widows. Scroll down for video . Formidable: Veuve Clicquot (left) was France's first businesswoman and invented rose Champagne, while Veuve Pommery (right) invented 'Brut' Champagne for Queen Victoria . Good grape: Grape vines grow in the Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin vineyards in Saint Thierry, near Reims, eastern France. Experts say that Champagne was one of the first industries in the modern world that women shaped and in which they enjoyed a prominent role . Then there are the many lesser-known names that still carry the widow tag, such as Veuve Fourny and Veuve Doussot. From its bottle shape to its taste, color, labeling and even marketing, Champagne owes its uniqueness to a series of widows from the early 19th century who used the sometimes mysterious deaths of their husbands to enter the male-dominated business world. The widows became so successful that dozens of Champagnes added 'Veuve' to their names even though no widow ran the house - just for its mystique and marketing value. Tradition: Today there are 349 Champagne houses that together generate 4.4 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in revenue a year. Pictured right, is the oldest Pommery Millesime bottle, dated 1874 . Good bottle: Bottles of champagne are piled up inside the Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin cellars. It was Madame Clicquot who invented the modern bottle-shape still used today . Trailblazer: A stone marker stands at a Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin vineyard in the village of Verzy, near Reims. She also invented the revolutionary technique of 'rilling' - a method of turning the bottle to get rid of nasty, cloudy sediment that stagnated in the drink . 'Champagne is the story of widows,' said Francois Godard, scion of Veuve Godard et Fils Champagne house. 'Women who lost their husbands, and then outshone the men.' Widowhood gave these figures an independent social status in France. Unlike other women - who were the property of a father or a husband - only a widow could become a CEO. 'In the 19th century ... if you're not married you're dependent on your father, you can't have a bank account and you can't pay staff. If you are married you are reliant on your husbands,' explained Fabienne Moreau, Veuve Clicquot's archivist. 'Only a widow can take this position as head of a company.' Experts say that Champagne was one of the first industries in the modern world that women shaped and in which they enjoyed a prominent role. Rare opportunity: Unlike other women - who were the property of a father or a husband - only a widow could become a CEO . We're watching: The stern expressions of these women stare out from portraits that hang in their sprawling Reims-based mansions in the French region of Champagne, the only place in the world where bubbly can legally be called Champagne. Their faces even appear on bottle caps .

Once upon a cold October's day in 1805, Francois Clicquot, the young heir to a Champagne dynasty, suddenly died after a grape harvest, a few years after marrying the fresh-faced Barbe-Nicole. It was a thunderbolt in the conservative Champagne landscape when the 27-year-old widow defied male opposition to take over the house. Opportunistic and tough as nails, the . young widow transformed the small house into a global empire. Madame . Clicquot exploited the chaos created by Napoleonic wars to tap the . European market, before taking in Russia and then the United States. 'Champagne . owes a lot to her. Madame Clicquot was the first businesswoman in . France, and maybe the whole of Europe,' says Moreau, who says that the . house created the annual Business Woman Award in 1972 to evoke her . legacy and champion the success of female entrepreneurs around the . world. Mansion: The house for decades was called Veuve Pommery, before the 'Veuve' was removed. Subsequently, the widow was celebrated with the house's best Champagne - Cuvee Louise - named after her . Danger fields: The 19th century was a time before the . invention of antibiotics, when men working in biting conditions outside . would more easily succumb to deadly illness . Good times: A giant bas-relief engraved in a chalk plaque depicts an 18th century champagne celebration. After Veuves Clicquot and Pommery, men who ran Champagne houses would scramble to find a widow in the family after whom they could name their house, in hopes of boosting sales . Working until she dropped dead at 89, Veuve Clicquot left behind a formidable legacy: She invented rose Champagne, the world's first Champagne label and - according to Moreau - was behind the distinctive modern Champagne bottle: slender and elegant in contrast to its clunky, heavy-set predecessor. Top client: Both Veuve Clicquot and Veuve Pommery possessed such great audacity and ambition partly through the influence of Queen Victoria, who had a weakness for Champagne and was counted among these two houses' top clients . With the glass bottle, Veuve Clicquot smashed the glass ceiling. Added to this was the invention of Veuve Clicquot's revolutionary technique of 'rilling.' It was a method of turning the bottle to get rid of nasty, cloudy sediment that stagnated in the drink, a process that made the beverage clear and pleasant. It's still used today. Widow Pommery was next. Her husband died in unexplained circumstances in 1860. 'We don't know if Monsieur Pommery drank too much Champagne, or perhaps not enough, but he dies and leaves his business to the young widow,' said Christine Prudhomme, head of visits at Pommery. 'When he died, it was perhaps the opportunity she was looking for,' said Prudhomme. 'She didn't just want to be a wife. Her (widowhood) really gave her wings.' Prudhomme said that the house for decades was called Veuve Pommery, before the 'Veuve' was removed. Subsequently, the widow was celebrated with the house's best Champagne - Cuvee Louise - named after her. The proliferation of Champagne widows may seem mysterious or suspicious, but experts explain the phenomenon through its era: The 19th century was a time before the invention of antibiotics, when men working in biting conditions outside would more easily succumb to deadly illness. The Champagne region was also an occasional stomping ground for foreign armies. Both Veuve Clicquot and Veuve Pommery possessed such great audacity and ambition partly through the influence of Queen Victoria. The powerful English queen, also a widow, had a weakness for Champagne's delicate effervescence and was counted among these two houses' top clients. Shrewd widow Pommery invented the world's first brut Champagne - the dry Champagne we know today - in response to requests from Queen Victoria for variations of what had been a cloying drink. Brut Champagne revolutionized the industry again. A lot of fizz: A total of 66906 bottles of champagne are piled up in this part of the Pommery cellars. From its bottle shape to its taste, color, labeling and even marketing, Champagne owes its uniqueness to a series of widows from the early 19th century . The art of Champagne: A stained glass of the Notre-Dame Cathedral of Reims depicts how to make Champagne . Bolly folly: Widow Lilly Bollinger sealed the industry's feminist reputation in 1941, when she took the reins from her deceased husband and rapidly expanded Bollinger internationally over three decades to the prominence it enjoys . 'Before it was very sugary, sometimes 250-300 grams per liter, it was like jam or marmalade,' said Thierry Gasco, cellar head at Vranken-Pommery. By the time Veuve Pommery came along, widows had become a commercial asset. Men who ran Champagne houses would scramble to find a widow in the family after whom they could name their house, in hopes of boosting sales. That was the case with Veuve Godard et Fils. 'There are the real widows and then there are the marketing widows,' says Prudhomme. 'Houses call themselves after widows because people will assume that there is a wonderful story behind the Champagne.' In a modern day testament to the widows' legacy, Veuve Clicquot's owner LVMH stands as the world's largest Champagne maker, followed by Vranken-Pommery. Today there are 349 Champagne houses that together generate 4.4 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in revenue a year. Widow Lilly Bollinger sealed the industry's feminist reputation in 1941, when she took the reins from her deceased husband and rapidly expanded Bollinger internationally over three decades to the prominence it enjoys. Bollinger was known for her bubbly wit. 'I drink it when I'm happy and when I'm sad. Sometimes I drink it when I'm alone. When I have company I consider it obligatory. I trifle with it if I'm not hungry and drink it when I am. Otherwise, I never touch it,' she once said, 'unless I'm thirsty.'","'Veuve' means widow in French and has lent its name to a variety of brands .

Patients are having to wait longer than six hours in ambulances parked outside A&E departments. Last week alone nearly 4,500 patients were kept in theÂ  vehicles for at least half an hour because staff were too busy to look after them. Figures obtained by BBC News under the Freedom of Information Act covered the three months until the end of October, and revealed that a patient in Wales was forced to wait six hours and 22 minutes, while another in East England was held for five hours and 51 minutes. Ordeal: A patient in Wales had to wait more than six hours outside an A&E department (file photo) Senior doctors and nurses said waits in most recent weeks could have been even longer. The . figures will add to concerns that casualty departments are struggling . to cope with the rising numbers of patients expected this winter. Dr . Clifford Mann, president of the College of EmergencyÂ  Medicine, which . representsÂ  casualty doctors, said: âThese figures relate to the three . months up until October. âThey . donât include the really pressured time of the winter and so itâs . unlikely these figures are going to improve â and that must be a cause . for concern. Thereâs always going to be a small number of patients whose . transfer is delayed, but not to the extent of these figures.â Ambulance . crews are meant to spend no longer than 15 minutes transferring . patients from their vehicles and if they breach this limit, hospitals . are fined. But if staff are too busy, theÂ  paramedics have to carry on . caring for them and at times there may be dozens of vehicles queued up . outside hospitals. It means . the ambulances are effectively immobilised and unable to attend other . 999 callouts, while patients are also at riskÂ  of deteriorating in the . backsÂ  of vehicles. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal . College of Nursing, said: âThings are going to get that much worse. âItâs very difficult now to discharge older people due to the huge cutbacks in social care.

"By . Luke Salkeld . PUBLISHED: . 19:08 EST, 9 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:09 EST, 9 December 2013 . Travellers living on an illegal campsite are being handed Â£500 of taxpayersâ money to spend on improving their caravans if they agree to move, it emerged yesterday. A council is already spending Â£1.1million on an alternative home for the 15 families currently living on the site. But despite offering individual plots of land, allotments, a childrenâs play area, and environmentally friendly features such as composting bins, most of the travellers want to stay where they are. Changes: A Â£1.2m plan to transform this illegal . travellers site at Haldon Hill near Exeter has been scrapped because . residents have refused to pay council tax . The local authority is now offering them each Â£500 to spend upgrade their vehicles and caravans as an added incentive to move. But the move has angered locals who say the handouts come as local services face severe cutbacks and austerity measures. For the past 12 years Haldon Hill, near Exeter, Devon, has been home to caravans, old buses, huts and shelters housing up to 100 travellers, causing tensions with the local community. After ten years spent trying to find a solution, Teignbridge District Council won a massive government grant to upgrade facilities and build a legal camp in nearby Haldon Ridge. It expected travellers to jump at the chance to upgrade to the new-look camp but only a handful of families signed up. Local campaigner Dudley Swain said the Â£500 hand-outs would leave council tax payers âpretty miffedâ. Barbara Philipson, 71, who has lived in the nearby village of Kennford with her husband John for 26 years, said: âThe council have made so many cutbacks itâs ridiculous to hand out money like this. âI really donât think itâs going to encourage the travellers to move on. âThey have tried so many things to move them off the site which have never worked and Iâm sure this wonât work either. Cash: The local council had secured a grant for the site but if the transformation is shelved they may have to pay back the cash . âTheyâre just going to profit from this and thereâs nothing to say they will actually spend it on their vehicles.â She added: âItâs a beautiful place up there and itâs been absolutely ruined. They have so many orders to move and they never do. âThey donât integrate themselves in any way with the community. Nobody goes anywhere near the site which is a shame as it is a beautiful place. âI think the council need to reassess the term traveller as several of the men who live on the site work and many of the children have gone to the local school. âThey donât conform to rules and regulations like the rest of us.â The council defended the use of public money saying it would help the new camp progress and enable the old site to be reclaimed more quickly. Local resident Dudley Swain, 66, said it was unfair for local taxpayers to fund up to Â£500 per family to move. He said: âI think people are going to be quite annoyed by this [payment] as it is being paid for by the taxpayers. Closed off: The woodland at Haldon Hill has been used illegally by travellers for twelve years . âThe money should be coming out of the Â£1.1 million grant thatâs already been given. âItâs the principle - what will be next? âThereâs 84 vehicles on that site, 45 which are occupied. The rest have been left there for years and are unoccupied and unmovable. âTheyâve knocked two acres of trees down in an area that is known for its beauty. Nobody goes up there anymore. âMy concern is that it could end up being like another Dale Farm with all the hostility which would be a huge shame.â Another of the siteâs neighbours, Doug Priest, 89, said: 'Itâs absolutely disgusting up there. I used to have a plot just by the site but I had to sell it as the sewage was coming onto my land. Thereâs no sanitation - itâs a complete disgrace.â He added: 'Itâs diabolical that the council have agreed to dish out yet more money for them. There are far better things they could be spending the money on. âThe area used to be lovely, but theyâve completely ruined it with all their broken down buses and rubbish.â Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayersâ Alliance, said last night: âCouncils are cutting budgets to help deal with the deficit, so itâs not right to dole out cash to do up caravans. âLocal politicians should be cutting out waste and ensuring that all communities get the quality services they deserve for their Council Tax they pay.â Teignbridge District Council secured a massive Â£1.1million government grant earlier this year to pay for the revamped camp. A nine-month programme of construction began this month to create 15 new pitches next door to the unauthorised site, and will involve tree clearance, installing utilities and clearing debris. Travellers allocated a pitch in the revamped camp will be required to sign a lease agreement, pay rent and council tax. Paused: The site was due to have 15 . state-of-the-art eco plots with communal allotments, a children's play . area, a site manager and environmentally friendly features such as . composting bins . In return they can look forward to new toilets, showers, power, bin stores and recycling facilities. Travellers first moved their vehicles on to the pretty woodland setting in August 2001. It began as a cluster of vehicles but over the next decade slowly morphed into a sprawling mass of huts and shelters, home to around 100 people. Opponents argued for years that the camp should be cleared and the residents moved on but Teignbridge District Council said the families had laid down roots and their kids attended local schools. The makeshift dwellings were officially âtoleratedâ by Devon County Council which owns the land and agreed the communityâs welfare outweighed the need to evict them. When the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) agreed to stump up the cash to revamp the site it was hailed as the first purpose-built new age traveller site in the country. Officials expected travellers to jump at the chance to stay - with the only condition being they would have to pay rates to contribute to the Â£40,000 annual running cost. By June, however, only 11 people had applied to move on to the new camp. Some had reportedly said they would rather move than sign up to an âofficial existenceâ.","Haldon Hill near Exeter has housed 100 travellers in vans for 12 years .

This is the moment a 15-year-old girl trying to jump a ticket barrier is picked up and slammed on the floor head-first by an officer. CCTV footage in Flinders Street Station, Melbourne, Australia, captured the girl and a friend slipping through a side gate before Metro inspectors race after them and grab them by the clothes. But the situation escalates when the girl turns to slap one of the men in the face. Outrage: Politicians blasted the July 31 incident in Melbourne which saw a 15-year-old girl hurled to the floor . He grabs her feet and plunges her to the floor before piling on top of her. The encounter on July 31 this year has sparked outrage with politicians blasting it as 'absolutely brutal and unnecessary treatment'. And following an investigation, the girl has been charged with assault as the officers were deemed to be 'acted in accordance with company policy'. 'At one stage there was three men on top of the one 15-year-old girl, which was just completely ridiculous,' witness Nick Manual told ABC News. Sneaking past: The girl and a friend were seen on CCTV slipping through a gate in Flinders Street station . Escalates: After the girl slapped one of the officers, all three close in forcefully and one goes for her feet . Commotion: Her friend and passers-by are seen to be shouting as the girl lies on the floor after the encounter . 'She was yelling that she couldn't breathe.' Victorian Greens leader Greg Barber, said the footage, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, 'wouldn't even be allowed on a rugby field', The Age newspaper reports. Mr Barber said: 'This sort of violence ... should never have been used against a slight, 15-year-old female. 'The effect could have been fatal, or even more likely, the girl could have been paralysed for life. 'Why did they pick her up, turn her upside down and drop her on her head? Because they could. They were big blokes, she was a tiny woman.' Capture: The officer, dressed down, lunges to grab the girl as she makes her way through the side gate . The moment: Politicians have blasted the moment the officer picked the girl up as 'unnecessary' In a leaked memo, investigating officer Alan Gosland, wrote: 'Spoke to Victoria Police Sergeant Craig Tepper who advises that they are not looking into any action by the officers as they have not received a complaint about them. They are however charging the two females with assault on the officers. Cheers.' The officer in the footage stated his actions were to stop the girl escaping after 'verbal reasoning ... to de-escalate the situation initially' had failed. In a compulsory Use of Force Incident Form, he wrote: 'Assaulted by the offender, punched in the face and bitten on left upper thigh when told to loosen hold due to offender saying she couldnât breathe.' Public Transport Minister Terry Mulder told The Age he was 'really concerned' by the footage and the incident would be investigated.","15-year-old girl slips past gate in Flinders Street, Melbourne, Australia .

The Australian activist who disrupted last yearâs Boat Race has won his battle against deportation after claiming his fellow countrymen would be racist to his wife who is of Indian descent. Trenton Oldfield, 37, had his application to remain in the country refused earlier this year after the Home Office deemed his presence âundesirableâ following the incident. But the protester, who was sentenced to six months in prison as a result of his publicity stunt, won on appeal after arguing that Australians were âpassive aggressiveâ racists. Trenton Oldfield appears at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in central London for an extradition hearing . He said that if he was forced to return to his home country, he would not be able to bring his wife Deepa Naik, who is of Indian descent, or his daughter. He said: âAustralia to Deepa... is a particularly racist country. There are particularly racist attacks on people of Indian descent.â Mr Oldfield went on to say while most of it was âwater coolerâ or unintentional racism, some Indians in Australia had been burned and physically assaulted. âI donât think I could put either Deepa or my child through that,â he said. Oldfield disrupted the annual Oxford v Cambridge competition in April last year as a protest against what he described as âentrenched elitismâ. He had his application for a spousal visa refused earlier this year but he won on appeal yesterday at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in Islington, north London. The protester, who has a five-month-old daughter, told judge Kevin Moore that he was inspired to disrupt the race after caring for his British wifeâs father, who was suffering from cancer. âI think I was vulnerable in terms of realising how short life can be,â he sobbed to the court. âI saw poverty and I saw the laws the government were passing that were going to make life substantially harder. âI think I was very emotional. When you go around London, you can see the pockets of deprivation that still exist.â Outside court, Oldfield told reporters: âIâm delighted to be able to get back to my work and spend time with my family.â He thanked his supporters, but said the public interest surrounding the case should highlight the problems surrounding deportation threats. âWhat I would like to say is this happens every single day in this building to all sorts of people and we need to start paying attention to these people who are experiencing what can be quite a violent experience of having the state come down on you,â he said. âDeportation is an old ideal and itâs from another time - 1,000 years ago. âWe need to rethink that and the mediaâs attention needs to be on not me anymore, but the people who are going in and out of this building and that is where the real issues are.â Protest: Trenton Oldfield, accompanied by his wife, Deepa Naik and their child, appeared at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in central London today for a hearing regarding extradition back to Australia. Oldfield, disrupted last year's University Boat Race on London's River Thames by swimming into the path of the crews . Oldfield said his wife had never been to Australia and had no interest in doing so. âMeeting Deepa was like meeting the person youâd always been searching for,â he said. âWeâre muses for each other, but also our strongest critics. âEverything we do is together. Every single part of our life is entangled together.â Oldfield said he worked with his wife in not-for-profit organisations and various charities. âI fell in love with London within two hours of arriving,â he said. âThere was room for people like me... who were interested in justice, interested in fairness.â Oldfield said he regretted many aspects of his protest, particularly the impact it had on his family and he would not be repeating his actions. Miss Naik, who had to leave the hearing at times to comfort the coupleâs crying daughter, later told the tribunal that he wanted to act against inequality. âWhen Trenton swam in the Thames, he had no idea at the time the potential consequence would be a prison sentence,â she said. âIt is the first and only time Trenton has done a protest like this.â Miss Naik said she did not want to think what would happen if he was deported. âItâs something I donât want to fathom,â she said. âIt would mean the destruction of everything weâve ever worked on.â Miss Naik said she did not want to go to Australia because she did not have any family or support networks there. She added that Australiaâs strict immigration laws would mean there would be a forced separation between Oldfield and his family. Outside court, Oldfield told reporters: 'I'm delighted to be able to get back to my work and spend time with my family' The judge heard from an Oxford professor who commended Oldfieldâs work and the court was handed a petition against his deportation signed by 265 Cambridge and Oxford staff and students. Darren Morley, representing the Home Office, said although the protester had some desirable characteristics, he still broke the law. âThe appellant was not trying to live within the laws of a country that welcomed him and helped him build a life here,â he said. But Stephanie Harrison QC, for Oldfield, argued her clientâs good work in the community outweighed the incident and caused only minimal disruption to the race. âHe has been trying... to make a difference to peopleâs lives who are on the rough end of society,â she said. âHe should not be doubly punished.â Judge Moore agreed, saying he thought Mr Oldfield was of good character. âIt would be my intention to allow the appeal,â he said to sighs of relief from Mr Oldfield and his supporters. A Home Office spokesperson said: âThose who come to the UK must abide by our laws. We refused this individual leave to remain because we do not believe his presence in this country is conducive to the public good. âAs we are awaiting the Judgeâs written determination in this case, it would not be appropriate to comment further.â","Trenton Oldfield, 37, had his application refused earlier this year .

Scroll down for video . Probe: The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has found no evidence of engine failure in the police helicopter which crashed through the roof of The Clutha Bar in Scotland, killing the three people on board and six more inside the pub . Working order: In a special bulletin, the AAIB said 'all significant components were present' at the time the two-engined Eurocopter EC135 helicopter crashed through the roof . In addition, the helicopter still had 95 litres of the 400kg of fuel that it had taken off with from Glasgow City Heliport. The AAIB said the twin-engined Eurocopter EC 135 aircraft had no flight . recorders, nor was required to do so. But there were some non . crash-protected system recordings that could be studied along with radio . communications and closed circuit TV recordings. Saying that the investigation would continue, the AAIB promised to report any significant developments. The pilot of the helicopter David Traill, 51, and his two passengers - . police officers Kirsty Nelis, 36, and Tony Collins, 43 - were killed in . the crash as were six people inside the pub. Mission: Rescue workers lift the police helicopter wreckage from the roof of The Clutha following the devastating crash . Poignant: Flowers and tributes left at the scene of the helicopter crash . Today's bulletin traced the events of the night of the crash. In . good visibility and light winds, the helicopter had left Glasgow City . Heliport at 8.45pm, gone first to the south side of the city, then on to . Dalkeith in Midlothian about 40 miles away before returning to Glasgow. The pilot had requested and received clearance from air traffic . controllers to re-enter the Glasgow control zone at 10.18pm and there . were no further radio transmissions received from him. Return journey: Helicopter pilot and crash victim David Traill, 51, had been on his way back to the Glasgow City Heliport when the aircraft was seen falling from the sky . The AAIB added that radar contact with the helicopter was lost at 10.22pm. The report went on: 'Around this time, the helicopter was seen and heard . by a witness who described hearing a noise like a loud ""misfiring car"", . followed by silence. 'He then saw the helicopter descend rapidly. It crashed through the roof . of The Clutha Bar, a single-storey building on Stockwell Street in . central Glasgow.' The report said that initial evidence indicated that the helicopter . struck the flat roof of the pub 'with a high rate of descent and . low/negligible forward speed'. The three occupants of the . helicopter and six people in, or adjacent to, the bar were fatally . injured. Thirty two other people suffered injuries, 12 seriously.' The six who died inside the pub were . Robert Jenkins, 61, Mark O'Prey, 44, Colin Gibson, 33, John McGarrigle, . 57, Gary Arthur, 48, and Samuel McGhee, 56. The AAIB went on: 'Preliminary examination showed that all main rotor . blades were attached at the time of the impact but that neither the main . rotor nor the fenestron tail rotor (a form of protected tail rotor) were rotating. 'The impact forces caused the roof of the bar to collapse and (the) helicopter entered the building, its forward section coming to rest on . and amongst building debris. 'Very extensive damage and disruption of the helicopter structure and . components resulted from the impact forces and from contact with the . collapsing building. The helicopter did, however, remain approximately . upright.' On duty: Police constables Tony Colins, 43, and Kirsty Nellis, 36, were both on board the helicopter when it crashed, killing them both and their civilian pilot . Victims: Window cleaner Mark O'Prey, 44, and Samuel McGhee, 56, had both been inside the pub . The AAB said its team, working closely with the emergency services and . the authorities in Glasgow, had conducted a preliminary examination of . the aircraft within the collapsed area of the pub. After that, the damaged sections of . the building were shored up and made safe, 'enabling closer examination . to be carried out'. The report went on: 'Initial assessment provided no evidence of major . mechanical disruption of either engine and indicated that the main rotor . gearbox was capable of providing drive from the No 2 engine turbine to . the main rotor and to the fenestron drive shaft.' However, the state of the building . limited the extent to which examination of the helicopter was possible . at the scene, the AAIB added. The report continued: 'After further . debris removal and cutting off the main rotor blade, it was determined . that the helicopter structure remained sufficiently robust for it to be . lifted clear of the building by means of a crane, using strops attached . to the main rotor head. 'Once removed from the building, approximately 95 litres of fuel were drained from the fuel tank system.' Colin Gibson, 33, left, was killed in the Glasgow helicopter crash, along with Robert Jenkins, 61, pictured right . John McGarrigle, 57, was killed in the disaster, as was 48-year-old Gary Arthur, who was the first victim to be named by police . The helicopter was then transferred to its headquarters at Farnborough in Hampshire. The AAIB promised to report any significant developments as the investigation progressed. The . pilots' union Balpa said: 'The information published by the AAIB today . is a helpful first assessment of the facts of the case and suggests . there is no evidence of mechanical engine failure. 'But, . unfortunately, at this stage, there is not much more to go on and the . reasons behind the crash are, in truth, far from clear. The AAIB must be . given the time to complete its thorough investigation and we have faith . in their ability to do so.' The special bulletin was released on the same day that the families of two victims gathered together to mark their funerals. Friends of Mark O'Prey attended a service in his home town of East Kilbride, South . Lanarkshire, where hundreds of mourners packed into St Bride's RC Church . to pay their respects.

The the horror of her mother, superfan Nicole Hassall, 18, racked up the huge bill in just six hours as she bid to keep her idol in the jungle. The teenager made a staggering 2,316 calls to the ITV showâs 50p premium . rate number in support of the Emmerdale star - unaware her phone bill . would sky-rocket as a result. Superfan: Teenager Nicole Hassall racked up a Â£1,158 phone bill after voting for I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here star Lucy Pargeter more than 2,000 times . Now her mother Eileen, 62, has been forced to use Â£250 earmarked for Nicoleâs Christmas presents to pay off the charges. She has now warned parents to be vigilant if their children become hooked on primetime TV shows which encourage viewers to vote. She said network provider Orange did not notify them until Saturday morning that Nicole had logged so many calls after Wednesday nightâs edition of the show. Idol: Nicole made a staggering 2,316 calls to the ITV show's 50p premium rate number in support of Emmerdale star Lucy (pictured) Account holder Mrs Hassall then received a text warning her of a Â£350 bill, shortly followed by a further message which put the amount at Â£621. Furious Mrs Hassall, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, then rang Orange only to be told the actual amount was an eye-watering Â£1,158. She has now called for tighter controls on dialling premium-rate numbers from mobiles and questioned how her daughter was able to rack up such a huge bill. She said: 'It just kept going up and up. She had no idea what she was doing. 'Her phone said she still had minutes and texts left. Missing out: Nicole's mother Eileen, 62, has been forced to use Â£250 earmarked for her daughter's Christmas presents to pay off the bill . 'Iâm questioning that she could have made that many calls. 'We watched the show together and then went to bed.

'Itâs completely out of the ordinary. Sheâs never done this before. 'Thereâs no way Iâll be able to pay this.' Nicole, who has mild learning difficulties, said she was unaware the bill would be so high as she voted for Lucy to stay in the jungle. In action: Lucy Pargeter takes part in a gruelling Bushtucker Trial . In vain: Despite Nicole voting for her thousands of times Lucy Pargeter came third in this year's series . She said: 'I did vote but I really wanted Lucy or Kian from Westlife to win. 'I had no idea the bill would be this much. 'Iâm really upset.' Orange said it took measures to avoid high charges and had waived half of the outstanding Â£908 bill. A spokesman added: 'We sympathise with Ms Hassall and have offered a 50 per cent reduction on her bill as a gesture of goodwill. 'To help customers avoid high charges from voting lines we terminated each of the calls after six seconds. Winner: Westlife singer Kian Egan eventually received the King Of The Jungle crown from presenters Ant and Dec .

Two prisoners who shared fantasies of killing someone disembowelled and attempted to behead a fellow inmate with a weapon made out of razor blades and plastic cutlery they'd been given by guards. The body of convicted child rapist Mitchell Harrison, 23, was found with severe neck and eye injuries and a slashed open abdomen after fellow inmates Nathan Mann, 25, and Michael Parr, 34, attacked him at high-security HMP Frankland Prison in Durham. Today, as the inquest into Harrison's death opened at Crook Coroner's Court in County Durham, a jury heard how the killers - who had intended to eat their victim's liver but decided not to at the last minute - had a cup of tea and a cigarette afterwards before asking a guard to open the cell door. Michael Parr, 34, left, and Nathan Mann, 25, attacked inmate Mitchell Harrison, 23, with a homemade weapon . Durham Coroner Andrew Tweddle, warned the jury today that the details of the death would be âgruesomeâ, âgraphicâ and âdistressingâ, but urged them to 'never lose sight of the fact that this was a real person and someoneâs son.' It emerged that the prisoners attacked Harrison, who was serving an indefinite sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl, with a home-made knife they'd made out of disposable razor blades and a plastic knife. Robert Young, acting deputy governor at HMP Frankland, told the jury that at the time of the killing in October 2011, the number of disposable razor blades and plastic knives given to prisoners was not monitored. He said: 'We issue them with toiletries and disposable razor blades.Â  At the time of Mr Harrisonâs death there was no restriction to the number of disposable razor blades. 'We provide them with everyday items so they can live as normal life as possible, but because of the people we work with, an everyday item can become a lethal weapon.' Mr Young said: 'If a prisoner said ""I have snapped a fork"" we would routinely issue them another one and then it would be down to the knowledge of staff. Mitchell Harrison, 23, died after he was attacked by two prisoners at HMP Frankland in County Durham in October 2011 . 'If it was on a repeated basis we would take note of that.' Mitchellâs mother, father and step-father attended the inquest but showed little emotion as the disturbing details of their sonâs death were recalled. Giving evidence, Detective Chief Inspector Steve Chapman told the inquest how Mann and Parr planned to kill a fellow prisoner, apparently chosen at random. He said: 'Some weeks previously they decided how they would like to kill somebody within the prison system - they had got themselves quite excited by that. 'He [Harrison] thought he was going down there [to Mannâs cell] to keep watch while Mann and Parr engaged in some sexual activity. 'He was immediately attacked by Mann on the bed and the door was shut by Parr. 'He asked for a pen from Parr and he put the pen into his left eye. 'He then looked to cut his head off. He certainly tried to do that by putting the knife into the neck on several occasions. 'Mann then cut down the middle of the stomach. 'There was some suggestion that they wanted to take his liver out and actually eat his liver. 'There had been a further suggestion to cut a T along the waistline.Â  They didnât like what they saw and decided against that. 'They then decided to have a cup of tea and a cigarette prior to asking for the door to be opened.' The inquest jury heard that prisoners were given disposable razor blades and plastic cutlery at HMP Frankland . The killers then informed the senior officer on duty what they had done, and gave similar accounts of what happened in their subsequent interviews, the inquest heard. It was said that Harrison, Parr and Mann were classed as âvulnerableâ prisoners because their crimes made them a target to others on the wing. Mann was serving a sentence for the murder of two women in a Leicestershire nursing home and Parr had been convicted of attempted murder. Speaking of the risk posed by Mann and Parr, Mr Young said: 'Neither were particularly high on the radar. 'Some of the information submitted through security information reports had indicated that both prisoners had issued some threats to both staff and other prisoners. 'In context we could have 50 to 60 at the time who had threatened to kill and, without minimising these threats, we try and take each one on an individual basis and take appropriate action. 'Many are just comments in the heat of the moment.' The inquest is expected to conclude later this week. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Michael Parr, 34, and Nathan Mann, 25, lured Mitchell Harrison, 23 to cell .

A Swedish teenager has been found guilty of robbery after police found a photograph of her posing with a knife on her phone. The 'selfie' shows the 16-year-old and another girl wearing balaclavas, taken shortly before a robbery of a fast food restaurant in Halmstad, south-west Sweden. Just 47 minutes after restaurant staff called police, officers tracked down the teenager to a nearby flat where they found two balaclavas, 2,000 SEK (Â£187) and the girl's mobile phone. Incriminating selfie: When police caught the 16-year-old girl after the robbery they found several selfies of her and an unidentified girl posing with balaclavas and kitchen knives . It was in March this year that two young girls in balaclavas armed with an 11in kitchen knife ran in to a Max Hamburgers restaurant in Halmstad. Staff was closing down, but there were still three customers in the facility. One of the girls threatened staff with the knife, shouting 'Hand over the money! Open the cash machine or I will cut you!,' Swedish newspaper Kvallsposten reports. A male employee told police one of the girls waved the knife inches from his body. Staff handed over just under Â£190 and the two girls disappeared into the night. It took police dogs less than an hour to follow the tracks to a block of flats not far from the restaurant. Inside the flat marked by the dog, police found three girls, 13, 14 and 16, and the oldest teen's grandfather, who told police two of the teenagers had just 'come back from a walk'. Teenage thugs: The two girls stole 2,000 SEK (Â£187) from the restaurant, which was found at the flat of the convicted teenager's grandfather (stock image) Police located a bag with the money and two balaclavas, as well as the girl's while iPhone. The phone contained 'a large number' of photographs of two girls posing in hoods with kitchen knives as well as instructions on how to committ a robbery and how to escape detection afterwards. It also had a photo of cash, believed to be the money taken from the restaurant. The girl, now 17, has been found guilty of armed robbery and sent to a juvenile correction facility. The court noted that had the girl been over 18, she would have been handed a jail sentence. The girl still denies that she was anywhere near the restaurant at the time of the robbery. Police have not been able to identify the second robber.","Swedish teens took a selfie in balaclavas before robbing a restaurant .

A 17-year-old boy who murdered a man with a single punch just days after he wildly attacked strangers at random in the street was jailed for life today. Eden Lomax had been caught on CCTV dealing one-punch knockouts to two innocent men during what he boasted were his personalised âbombâ attacks. As one victim collapsed unconscious into the entrance of the nearby bus, Lomax was overheard joking: âI think he wants an adult day saverâ. Scroll down for video . 17-year-old Eden Lomax (left) has been found guilty of the murder of Simon Mitchell (right) with one punch . First attack: CCTV footage of the first attack where on the night of Friday, 7 June 2013, just seven days before Simon died, Lomax punched a 31-year-old man in the face as stood at a bus stop . Attack: CCTV of the second attack, four days after the first. This time Lomax punched a drunken 41-year-old man without warning after they struck up a conversation . Just three days after the assaults in Bolton town centre the ginger haired teenager fatally set about Simon Mitchell after laughing and telling friends: 'Iâm going to bomb him.' Mr Mitchell, 43, was thumped in the face and sent crashing to the ground after trying to shake Lomaxâs hand saying: 'Whatâs a bomb?' Then as the victim laying dying on the floor with a fractured skull caused when his head hit the pavement, Lomax retorted: 'Thatâs a f***ing bomb.' A 16-year-old boy attempted to tend to the victim but Lomax told him to leave it because 'the piece of s*** deserved it,' it was claimed. Lomax fled the scene to drink and play computer games at a friendâs house as fork lift truck driver Mr Mitchell lay in the street. He was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from serious head and brain injuries. Pictures from the horrifying CCTV footage emerged as Lomax was convicted of murder following a two week trial. Today, he was ordered to serve a mininum of ten years in jail. Second attack: Lomax punched the victim once in the face, the force of the punch knocked him backwards through the open doors of a waiting bus . Knocked down: Lomax punched 41-year-old Paul Caulderbank with so much force to the back of the head that he fell through the open doors of a nearby stationary bus and remained on the floor until the driver came to assistance . 'Bully': Detective Chief Inspector Pete Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, described Lomax as a 'coward and a bully' The judge Mr Justice Peter Openshaw said: 'What he did suggests cowardly enthusiasm to resort to violence against men who through drinking were unable to defend themselves. 'Simon Mitchell was vulnerable through drink whereas the defendant is well built, physically fit and strong. Mr Mitchell was inoffensively telling him his problems. The defendantâs reaction was to deliver this punch.' Manchester Crown Court was told in the days before the tragedy on June 14 Lomax attacked âmen he didnât know from Adamâ, leaving them prone in the street. CCTV footage was shown in court of Lomax unleashing a vicious blow to the face of 30-year-old Stephen Swanton at a bus stop on Blackhorse Street, Bolton - because he had put his arm around Lomax and a female friend. A few seconds pass before Mr Swanton is knocked off his feet by the punch, hitting his head on a nearby wall leaving him unconscious. Lomax can be then seen walking calmly away while a number of youths run quickly across the road.Further video evidence was served of the incident on June 11 at Bolton bus station, where Lomax punched 41-year-old Paul Caulderbank with so much force to the back of the head that he fell through the open doors of a nearby stationary bus and remained on the floor until the driver came to assistance. The tragedy occurred after Mr Mitchell, who lived with his father and brother, had spent the afternoon drinking in Bolton with his friend Neil OâDonnell. He bumped into Lomax who had been watching movies with friends on an Ipad at around 8pm. Mr Mitchell made innocuous remarks expressing his sadness that two of his friends had recently committed suicide. But Lomax then âsnappedâ, as his own stepfather had also taken his own life and started saying to friends who tried to calm him down: 'Iâm going to bomb him. Leave me alone or Iâll fall out with you.' Mr Mitchell, sensing trouble, offered his hand for Lomax to shake and apologised but the teenager laughed and said âif you donât f*** off I will bomb you.' One eye witness told the jury: 'Eden asked the man to stop talking about suicide, but he wouldnât listen. Eden was getting annoyed, his face dropped. 'He was getting aggressive. He was bouncing up and down on his toes. We could tell he was angry by the fact his face went red and serious and he was smiling before. 'The man asked Eden what he meant by his threat to âbombâ him and I was shocked when Eden hit him. 'It was horrible, all you could hear was his head thump. The man had turned his head around and asked what a bomb was, he wasnât aggressive. Eden punched him and said âthatâs a bomb.' The witness rang 999 when he could see Mr Mitchell was not moving and added: 'He wasnât breathing properly. He was making choking noises and he had turned purple.' Police attended an address in Little Lever, Bolton, two days after the attack where they arrested Lomax. In interviews he claimed Mr Mitchell was aggressive and he reacted in self-defence. Tributes: Mr Mitchell, who lived with his father and brother, had spent the afternoon drinking in Bolton with his friend Neil OÂ¿Donnell. He was found suffering from head injuries . Killed: Simon Mitchell, aged 43, of Bolton, was found collapsed. Simon was taken by ambulance to Royal Bolton Hospital where he was later pronounced dead . He pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. After the case Detective Chief Inspector Pete Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Simon lost his life at the hands of a young thug, who was driven by aggression and pent-up violence and revelled in the fact that he could knock vulnerable people unconscious with a single punch, which he referred to as his ""bomb"". 'Like all cowards and bullies he targeted people who he knew could not defend themselves or fight back. Twice in the previous week he had knocked vulnerable men to the ground with a single punch for no reason whatsoever. 'It is was tragic way for Simonâs evening to end. It has left his father and family devastated. My thoughts are with them and I hope that the justice delivered today will provide some comfort to them. 'I hope this incident serves as a timely reminder of the real dangers to life involved when people throw a punch. Too many people have lost their lives in such incidents. I would urge people to think before they ever contemplate throwing a punch, you could cost someone their life and spend the rest of your own in a prison cell.â Prosecutor Robert Hall said: 'Mr Mitchell had the misfortune to come across Lomax and what followed was a tragic, unprovoked and thoroughly unnecessary attack by Lomax when instead he could simply have walked away. 'CCTV footage was shown at the trial as bad character evidence, this depicted the escalating pattern of violence that Lomax demonstrated in the week leading up to this fateful night should act as a severe warning to those who may be inclined to follow Lomaxâs bad example. 'Whilst todayâs conviction of Eden Lomax is a successful outcome in terms of justice, it does not bring back Mr Mitchell or remove the grief and distress felt by his family and friends. Our thoughts are with them.'","CCTV shows Eden Lomax dealing one-punch knockouts to innocent men .

She was taken into intensive care where she went into labour, despite efforts by doctors to halt the premature birth. Not only did Ms Kane survive the assault but she also gave birth to a healthy daughter, who was born three months early. Worcester Crown Court heard Smith went to Ms Kaneâs home at around 11pm on July 28, armed with a plastererâs knife. He forced his way in and attacked her in front of her other child in the hall before dragging her into the kitchen where he stabbed her with a second knife. Smith fled the scene but was arrested in nearby Hagley a short time later after phoning the police to turn himself in. The court heard Smith, from Great Barr, Birmingham, had targeted Ms Kane four years after the pair split up. At the time of the attack, she had been on the phone to her new partner - who dialled 999 after he heard her screams. Judge Robert Juckes jailed Smith for 15 years after he pleaded guilty to attempted murder. He ordered Smith to serve at least ten years before he is considered for parole. A second charge of attempted child destruction was ordered to lie on file. Ms Kane, who was seven months pregnant, suffered lacerations to her uterus and liver and a perforated bowel during the attack. Not only did Ms Kane survive the assault but she also gave birth to a healthy daughter, who was born three months early. (Posed by model) Speaking after the verdict, DI David Williams of West Mercia Police welcomed the sentence and branded Smith âdangerousâ. He said: 'Smith is clearly a very dangerous individual who attacked his former partner with the clear intention to kill the unborn child she was having with a new partner. 'The majority of stab wounds were to her abdomen and it is only the swift reaction of neighbours and her partner, and the prompt medical attention she received, that saved her life and that of her baby. 'Although the child was born a week later and was very premature, it has thankfully pulled through. 'This was a horrific case but the police officers on duty that night and in the following days displayed excellent teamwork and dedication in carrying out a speedy arrest and gathering enough evidence to ensure Smith could be kept in custody. 'The lengthy jail sentence handed down by the court reflects severity of the attack and we hope it brings some comfort to the victim and her family.'","Andre Smith, 25, attacked Rachel Kane, .

A divorced woman has been jailed after she set fire to her ex's house with the help of her best friend and killed an innocent woman who was sleeping inside. Nussrat Khatoon, 39, was sentenced to 14 years after she set fire to her ex's home, in Birmingham, killing a woman staying at the address as she slept inside, West Midlands Police said. Khatoon, of Kings Heath, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and reckless arson and her co-defendant Tina Andrews was found guilty of the same charges in September and was today jailed for 10 years. Nusrat Begum was asleep in one of the front bedrooms but was found in the rear bedroom by firefighters . Nussrat Khatoon (left), 39, was sentenced to 14 years after she pleaded guilty to manslaughter and reckless arson. Tina Andrews (right) was found guilty of the same charges in September and has now been jailed for 10 years . Khatoon married in August last year and divorced just four weeks later. Police said she then set about a catalogue of events where she damaged cars and threw paint at the house as well as making offensive phone calls. On one occasion, Khatoon followed and assaulted her ex-husband. On November 5, Khatoon decided with her best friend and co-defendant 30-year-old Andrews, to drive to a nearby road where the house could be seen. They drove deliberately without their lights on so they would not draw attention to themselves. They walked across a park area and approached the house where they set fire to a plant pot outside the front door while there were four occupants in the house. Three of the people could not get downstairs but managed to jump from the first floor into the garden, causing serious injuries and broken bones. A passing cyclist called the fire service and took a photo of the blaze on his phone, which enabled detectives to piece together the exact timings of when the fire was started and where the two women were . Nusrat Begum, 36, was asleep in one of the front bedrooms but was found in the rear bedroom by fire fighters. She had tried to escape but was trapped inside the property; she died as a result of smoke inhalation and burns, a police spokeswoman said. Ms Begum had only been in the country for four months after travelling from Pakistan where her marriage had failed. Khatoon and Andrews made no attempt to call emergency services and watched as the fire took hold of the house . Following a disagreement with her family she had gone to stay with her friend. Khatoon and Andrews, of Small Heath, made no attempt to call emergency services and watched as the fire took hold of the house. The two women watched from down the road for a minute and a half before they left in Khatoon's black BMW Coupe which had been parked some way from the property. A passing cyclist called the fire service and took a photo of the blaze on his phone, which enabled detectives to piece together the exact timings of when the fire was started and where the two women were. Further investigation into the BMW showed the vehicle had made a short journey around the time the fire was set. Khatoon was arrested later the same day and subsequently charged with manslaughter and reckless arson. Following her arrest, police officers found key items in her car - paper rolls with cotton on it like a taper, a fuel can and a lighter. The BMW ran on diesel but tests on the fuel can showed that it had petrol in it. Detective Chief Inspector Sarbjit Johal, from the homicide investigation team, said: 'Today's sentences will hopefully provide some sense of closure for Nusrat's family. 'Sadly Nusrat was caught up in circumstances totally unconnected to her and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'The fire, set by Khatoon and Andrews who knew people would have been trapped upstairs, turned into an impenetrable inferno. 'Khatoon was very resentful and angry and as a result of her and Andrews' actions, a completely innocent woman died.' Nusrat's brother Gulfraz Ahmed said: 'We had only recently been reunited with Nusrat as she had been estranged from us living in Pakistan. Only recently had we started to rebuild our relationship with her. 'The reason the fire was started had nothing to do with my sister so it is terrible that she has to pay the ultimate price.'","Nussrat Khatoon was sentenced to 14 years after she set fire to ex's home .

Car insurance premiums in Britain have come down by Â£30 in the past 12 months, thanks to tough new measures introduced by the Government after a year of campaigning by The Mail on Sunday against the epidemic of bogus whiplash injury claims. The MoS has exposed how law firms and claims management companies (CMCs) have been encouraging motorists to make bogus whiplash claims that have cost the insurance industry more than Â£2âbillion a year and raised every motoristâs premium by Â£90 annually. We have revealed how law firms paying referral fees of up to Â£750Â  to claims companies for each case they take on fuelled an industry of more than 5,000 unscrupulous CMCs that preyed on vulnerable motorists to make personal injury claims. The government brought in tough new measures after the Mail on Sunday campaigned against false claims for whiplash . Our investigations revealed how doctors were prepared to write medical reports falsely diagnosing whiplash. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling congratulated this newspaper forÂ  its campaign. âThe Mail on Sunday has fought against all this,â he said. âItâs fought for the rights of theÂ  little guy.â And he warned: âI have a bigÂ  message today for the insurers.

The industryâs Association ofÂ  British Insurers promised to pass on the savings. Spokesman Malcolm Tarling said: âWe have made a public commitment at a motoring conference with the Prime Minister last year that we will pass on the savings to the consumer. We will do that.â The latest figures, compiled by the AA, shows that in April last year an average fully comprehensive insurance was Â£778.38. But by last month the same type of insurance had dropped to Â£746.75. The figures reveal that in the past three months alone premiums came down by as much as Â£10. And a separate study by insurance comparison website Confused.com says that they may come down byÂ  as much as Â£100 by the end ofÂ  this year. The AA said changes in law and a greater public awareness of bogus whiplash claims had a significant impact on reducing the premiums.","Insurance premiums in Britain have come down by Â£30 in the past 12 months .

The former Manchester United skipper wasn't surprised by finer details of his time at Old Trafford featuring heavily in Ferguson's recent autobiography and is on the offensive during an ITV documentary with Patrick Vieira. Asked who he felt was the best boss during a 17-year career Keane said blankly: 'Brian Clough, without a doubt.' VIDEO Scroll down to see Sir Alex Ferguson claim Roy Keane overstepped the mark .

Helping hand: Keane developed into one of the best midfielders in the world under Sir Alex's guidance . When pushed on why not Ferguson - the most decorated manager in English football - Keane said: 'You asked me the question. I answered you.'

A self-styled peer dubbed the âLord of Fraudâ who once planned the worldâs biggest bank raid is facing years behind bars for a Â£6m investment scam. Lord Hugh Rodley, 65, along with Julian Silver, 43, Adam Corbett, 31, and Sonny Willis, 28, fleeced up to 600 pensioners into backing companies with the promise of ârich rewardsâ. The gang drew up âsucker listsâ of people they planned to exploit and splashed their criminal fortune on flash cars, including an Aston Martin, Range Rover S3 and a Lotus Elise. He also lived in Â£2 million mansion in Gloucestershire and was chauffered around in a Rolls-Royce. In 2010 Rodley was jailed for eight years for an extraordinary plot to steal Â£229m from a Japanese bank in one of the biggest ever cyber crimes of its kind. The plan to plunder Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2004, failed at the last minute after the bungling computer boffins inputted the wrong codes. Rodley, Silver, Corbett and Willis were found guilty by a jury of nine women and three men of running the scam between 2004 and 2007. It is alleged the gang spent the money on luxury cars including a Lotus Elise, like the one pictured . Phillip Dennett, 41, was cleared of involvement in the fraud but found guilty of laundering the proceeds along with the others. The men employed high pressure sales techniques and promised ârich rewardsâ to trick members of the public to invest in firms they claimed were to be floated on the stock market. They said the cash would be invested in âexoticâ and âfail-safeâ projects such as land development Europe and Asia, but none of the firms were ever floated. Investors were cherry-picked using so-called âsucker listsâ, detailing people who had already invested in some shares. One 87-year-old man lost more than Â£800,000 to the fraudsters. During the ten week long trial at Southwark Crown Court prosecutor Simon Farrell said the four men had been involved in the âdishonest extraction of several million poundsâ from investors. He said they were told they would quickly make âhandsome profitsâ when the companies were floated on the Alternative Investment Market. 1980 - under the name Hugh McGough, the Irishman admitted forging document and obtaining goods by misrepresentation, for which he was jailed for 15 months1987 - Convicted of three charges of obtaining property by disception and sentenced to spend time in prison2004 - Planned to steal Â£229 million from Japanese bank Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in one of the biggest ever cyber crimes of its kind.

Previous convictions: Lord Hugh Rodley was guilty of attempting to steal Â£229 million from the Sumitomo Matsui Banking Corporation and jailed for eight years . âOne 87-year-old gentleman, Mr Birch, unfortunately parted with Â£828,000 investing in most of the companies. âMany of the elderly victims are not fools by any stretch of the imagination; they are all successful, responsible individuals who eventually gave in to sales patter.â 'Many . of the elderly victims are not fools by any stretch of the imagination; . they are all successful, responsible individuals who eventually gave in . to sales patter.' Prosecutor Simon Farrell . Those who agreed to invest were almost always sent a contract setting out the amount of shares they agreed to, the price per share and a letter providing details of how their share made payment. But most people gained little or no contact afterwards, said the barrister. He added: âThe companies appear to have done little if any real trading and none of the investors received any return at all. âSubstantial amounts of money from victims were passed through bank accounts either controlled by or for the benefit of the defendants. Southwark Crown Court where Lord Hugh Rodley, 65 has been found guilty . At the heart of the scam was a âfloor bookâ - a list of hundreds of investors, of whom 600 handed over cash to the fraudsters. The document was seized after being discovered on Rodleyâs computer when his property was searched following his arrest. âThe book has in excess of 1000 names, 600 of which handed over money for investment. âThey didnât all hand over money, but hundreds did. âThe floor book records around Â£6million worth of investment and marks as received a figure in the region of Â£3million. âBut what the bank accounts show is what was actually received that can in fact be traced back to the floor book - around Â£2.7million. âThe defendants used so-called sucker lists, detailing people with small shareholdings, and started phoning people up offering shares in exotic land development buildings in Europe and Asia and water desalination projects.â Father-of-three Rodley had claimed he was not part of any plot to con investors telling jurors: âAt no time was I involved in selling worthless share. âI did not participate in any boiler room fraud. âI did not act dishonestly.â Rodley, who bought his manorial title at auction in 1986, said he believed Willis and Corbett were legitimate businessmen looking to help promote two of his companies, Mediatel and Eurowaste Recycling. Rodley, of (Tudor Manor), Church End, Tewksbury, Gloucestershire, Willis, of (Orchard View) Glebe Road, Ramsden Bellhouse, Billericay, Essex, Silver, of (Little Plumpton House), Hinx Hill, Ashford, Kent, and Corbett, of (Apartment 71) Dorchester Court, London Road, Camberley, Surrey, were all convicted of conspiracy to defraud.

A proposed âamnestyâ for those suspected of scores of unsolved murders during the NorthernÂ  Ireland Troubles provoked aÂ  furious backlash last night. Relatives of those killed in theÂ  30-year conflict reacted furiously to a call to halt further inquests and other state investigations into the crimes committed before the 1998 GoodÂ  Friday peace agreement was signed. John Larkin QC, the Attorney General in Northern Ireland, insisted his proposals did not amount to an amnesty. But he said he felt the time had come to halt prosecutions. No prosecutions: Killings carried out during the Troubles should no longer be investigated, the Northern Ireland attorney general has said. Here British soldiers examine an armoured Land Rover which was damaged during a grenade attack in 1997 . Yesterday . Colin Parry, whose 12-year-old son Tim was killed when the IRA bombed . Warrington 20 years ago, said Mr Larkinâs call was âhighly insensitiveâ. âThe . problem for me, and I guess for the vast majority of victims who have . never had anybody prosecuted or arrested for the offence they committed, . is that they will feel â as I do â that they have beenÂ  forgotten and . abandoned and the matter is just being filed away,â Mr Parry, 66, told . BBC Radio 5 Live. âIf by . chance some evidence were to pop out of the ether at some point in the . future, or somebody was to provide some inside information anonymously, . the prospect of there being an investigation and an arrest and possible . prosecution would exist, whereas if the Attorney Generalâs proposition . is supported and applied then that would not be possible.â Stephen . Gault, whose father Samuel was killed in the 1987 IRA Poppy Day bombing . in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, said he was disgusted. âHow dare he . airbrush the innocent people who were murdered at the hands of . terrorists to move things forward,â he said. Mickey . McKinney, whose brother William was killed by soldiers on Bloody Sunday . in Londonderry in 1972, called Mr Larkinâs proposal ridiculous. Murdered: Kathryn Eakin, nine, (left) and Tim Parry, twelve, (right) Conflict: Riots in Belfast following the death of IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands in 1981. The announcement that deaths prior to 1998 will not be investigated has sparked anger . The . police are currently re-investigating Bloody Sunday, withÂ  relatives of . those killed havingÂ  long campaigned for the soldiersÂ  allegedly . involved to be prosecuted. The 1998 Omagh bomb, which happened after the . Good Friday Agreement was signed, would not beÂ  covered by Mr Larkinâs . suggestion. He told the BBC: . âMore than 15 years have passed since theÂ  Belfast Agreement, there . have been very few prosecutions, and every competent criminal lawyer . will tell you the prospects of conviction diminish, perhaps . exponentially, with each passing year, so we are in a position now where . I think we have to take stock. Unrest: British soldiers in Northern Ireland in the aftermath of Bloody Sunday . Reaction: Former Northern Ireland Secretary of State Peter Hain described the proposals as 'commonsense' âIt . strikes me that the time has come to think about putting a line, set at . Good Friday 1998, with respect to prosecutions, inquests and other . inquiries.â He said crimes of the past would remain crimes but âit would . simply be that no criminal proceedings would be possibleâ with respect . to them. Michael Gallagher, . whose son Aiden was killed in the August 1998 Real IRA attack in Omagh, . which claimed 29 lives, said the attorney general was sending out a . totally wrong message to terrorists. Dissident republicans have murdered . two soldiers, two policemen and a prison officer in the last five . years. âHe is saying, âIf you murder enough people, the Government will . make a deal with you and you will eventually get offâ,â said Mr . Gallagher. Ruling out an amnesty, David Cameron told the Commons it would be ârather dangerousâ to block possible future prosecutions. Former . US diplomat Dr Richard Haass is trying to achieve political consensus . on a number of issues as yet unresolved during the peace process â one . of which is how the province addresses the legacy ofÂ  its violent past . and the seemingly endless unanswered questions over killings carried out . by all sides. Mr Larkin outlined his controversial proposals in a submission to Dr Haass. The Claudy Bombing (Bloody Monday) IN 1972 the IRA exploded three car bombs in quick succession in the main street of Claudy, a village in Co Londonderry, killing nine. Among the dead was nine-year-old Kathryn Eakin. She had been playing outside her familyâs shop.

Arrested: 31-year-old English teacher teacher Stevie Glasspool was arrested Thursday after it was revealed that she tried to solicit sex from at least four of her students online . A South Florida teacher was arrested after allegedly soliciting sex from at least four students online. Stevie Glasspool, 31, used to teach English at Mavericks Charter High School before she was arrested on Thursday for soliciting sex from students ranging in age from 15 to 17. The teacher's affairs were revealed when the target of one of her solicitations showed inappropriate messages he received from Glasspool to another teacher and she was fired. She went on to get hired at another . school, Hollywood Academy of Arts and Science, and worked the first . four days of the new school year before being arrested by Palm Beach Police. Broward . County Sheriff's Office says she sent the messages this past April and . May, and all of her victims attended Mavericks. They believe there may . be more victims who have not yet come forward. According . to one of the victims, 17-year-old Chris O'Neill, her messages to him . on Facebook started off innocent but progressed into something sexual . quickly. She . sent him messages saying things like 'You should spend the night' and . 'You will be graded on your performance', even luring him with the . promise of marijuana. Victim: Chris O'Neill, a 17-year-old junior at Mavericks Charter School where Glasspool taught, said she sent him inappropriate messages on Facebook last April and May . Proof: Student Chris O'Neill saved one of the messages that Glasspool sent to him on Facebook . 'I . don't want you to fall in love with me but I also don't want you to hit . it and quit it either,' she wrote in one of her messages. She also seemed to get irrationally annoyed when he wouldn't immediately respond to her messages. 'It . would be, ""Hi, Hey, Hi, Hi. Why aren't you answering me? Are you mad at . me? What did I say?"" It was just pathetic,' Mr O'Neill told NBC South Florida. At . first O'Neill liked the attention, but when he found out that she . propositioned a 15-year-old, he knew something was 'not right in her . head'. All four of the victims who have come forward so far went to Mavericks Charter School, left. Glasspool was fired from that school in May and went on to work the first four days of the new school year at Hollywood Academy, right, before being arrested . His father Frank O'Neill was equally as shocked. 'It . just disgusted me,' he told CBS Miami. 'It made me sick to my stomach. Who can you . trust because I always put teachers up there with policemen, . firefighters, you know - role models.' The student turned her in and now she is being charged with soliciting a child for unlawful sexual conduct . O'Neill doesn't feel bad about reporting his former teacher. 'This lady is just a whack job,' he said. 'Whatever happens to her, happens to her and I have no remorse for anything.' As for Mavericks, the school where all four victims are from, they say they conducted a background search and nothing turned up. Broward County Sheriff's spokesman Detective Ann Suter said Glasspool went from charter school to charter school and since she didn't have a criminal background she never raised any red flags. 'Her background check would show nothing as far as her being fired from different schools and she has no arrest history, of course, so it wouldn't pick that up,"" Suter told the Sun-Sentinel.

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 10:26 EST, 9 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:20 EST, 9 December 2013 . The latest revelations from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden have taken a bizarre turn with the claim that American and British spies have been posing and playing as orcs and elves on the popular multiplayer online game World of Warcraft - potentially spying on up to 50 million people. Spy chiefs at the NSA began to fear in 2008 that online games such as Second Life and Warcraft could become forums for covert communications between terrorists - enabling them to move money and to plot atrocities, all the while hiding among the millions of virtual gamers all with online alter-egos. Newly released documents from the hundreds of thousands stolen by Snowden from the NSA reveal that real secret agents have been operating in virtual gaming worlds tracking millions of players - even going as far as attempting to recruit online informants while playing. Real life James Bond's operating in a virtual world online: American and British spies have been revealed to be posing online on games such as World of Warcraft (pictured) and Second Life . The NSA document, written in 2008 and titled Exploiting Terrorist Use of Games & Virtual Environments expresses the NSA's worry that despite their wide-reaching PRISM clandestine surveillance of hundreds of millions of people online, terrorists could evade their wide reaching snooping. New revelations: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden speaking in October - the former defense contractor has revealed that American intelligence operatives operated online in World of Warcraft and Second Life to try and catch terrorists . The Guardian has reported that QCHQ, the British counterpart of the NSA even sent operatives into Second Life in 2008 and infiltrated a criminal ring that was selling stolen credit card information in that virtual world. The Snowden files reveal that the real-life sting in a virtual world was named Operation Galician and was helped by a recruited online informer who 'helpfully volunteered on the target group's latest activities.' Citing the documents disclosed by Edward Snowden, the report also says agencies 'have built mass-collection capabilities' against Microsoft's Xbox Live online network. Important details â such as how much data was gathered, or how many players' information was compromised â were not clear, the reports said. Blizzard Entertainment, the producer of World Of Warcraft, told the Guardian: âWe are unaware of any surveillance taking place. If it was, it would have been done without our knowledge or permission.â Online games such as World of Warcraft and Second Life are huge business as players adopt avatars of different people or indeed, orcs, goblins and elves. NSA HQ: Reports say British and American intelligence officers have been spying on gamers across the world, deploying undercover officers to virtual universes and sucking up traffic from popular online games such as World of Warcraft . The 2008 NSA report claims that if the intelligence garnered from the spying on these online games was used correctly, then pictures of ordinary citizen's and potential terrorist social networks could be built up. The NSA document reportedly claims to suggest that such infiltration 'continues to uncover potential Sigint value by identifying accounts, characters and guilds related to Islamic extremist groups, nuclear proliferation and arms dealing.' Second Life especially intruiged the NSA and GCHQ, because of its plans to introduce voice calls and anonymous texts - that terrorists could utilize. However, the document revealed by Snowden details no clear indication that the widespread surveillance ever discovered any terrorists or even foiled any attacks - raising serious issues over the privacy of online gaming. Microsoft declined to comment on the latest revelations, as did Philip Rosedale, the founder of Second Life. Monitoring: The NSA and Britain's GCHQ have neither confirmed nor denied that they have been spying on the personal details of up to 50 million virtual gamers . The NSA declined to comment on the surveillance of games. A spokesman for GCHQ told The Guardian the agency did not 'confirm or deny' the revelations but added: 'All GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that its activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and there is rigorous oversight, including from the secretary of state, the interception and intelligence services commissioners and the intelligence and security committee.' Indeed, so rife was the spying online of Second Life by the FBI, CIA, and the Defense Humint Service that a memo was sent to try and 'deconflict' their work - i.e. make sure that they weren't treading on each other's toes. However, the British credit card fraud bust aside, there are no other examples of the surveillance of these popular virtual worlds yielding any results in terms of anti-terrorism. The agencies did have concerns beyond simple money laundering and planning though. The NSA thought that games played online could be used to 'reinforce prejudices and cultural stereotypes' - pointing out that Hezbollah had produced their own game called Special Forces 2. According to the document, Hezbollah's 'press section acknowledges the game is used for recruitment and training', serving as a 'radicalizing medium' with the ultimate goal of becoming a 'suicide martyr'. Despite the game's disturbing connotations, the 'fun factor' of the game cannot be discounted, it states. As Special Forces 2 retails for $10, it concludes, the game also serves to 'fund terrorist operations.'","Latest revelations from Edward Snowden reveal the NSA has been using agents to pose as players on World of Warcraft .

David Cameron held back dozens of communications between himself and Rebekah Brooks from the Leveson Inquiry on legal advice, it emerged yesterday. Downing Street confirmed that the Prime Minister did not hand over the content of texts and emails of a social nature with the former News of the World editor since they did not fall within Lord Justice Levesonâs remit. Shadow Home Office minister Chris Bryant accused Mr Cameron of being âless than straightforwardâ in his handling of the affair.

The Leveson Inquiry only . permitted part of one to be released to the public on the grounds that . the others were not relevant to the terms of the inquiry. It revealed that Mrs Brooks, who is . now facing trial for perverting the course of justice, had told Mr . Cameron âprofessionally weâre definitely in this togetherâ. It has now . emerged that Mr Cameron took advice fromÂ  government lawyers about which . of his own texts and emails should beÂ  disclosed and failed to pass on . those of a social nature.

The âgolden goodbyeâ award is thought to consist of cash and pension payments as well as use of a chauffeur-driven car and an allowance for legal fees. Ms Brooks, who headed Australian tycoon Rupert Murdochâs UK newspaper arm, quit in disgrace last July. Ms Brooks, from Churchill in Oxfordshire, is accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over allegations that she tried to conceal information from police investigating phone hacking and claims of corrupt payments to public officials at The Sun and the News of the World. The trial is set to take place next September. News of the payoff also emerged on the eve of yesterday's annual general meeting of News Corp, News Internationalâs parent group. The award for Brooks - much higher than the Â£1.7m cash pay-out previously reported - is also set to rile investors.

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail . PUBLISHED: . 22:25 EST, 15 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:41 EST, 15 June 2013 . Top U.S. intelligence officials said on Saturday that information gleaned from two controversial data-collection programs run by the National Security Agency thwarted potential terrorist plots in the U.S. and more than 20 other countries - and that gathered data is destroyed every five years. Last year, fewer than 300 phone numbers were checked against the database of millions of U.S. phone records gathered daily by the NSA in one of the programs, the intelligence officials said in arguing that the programs are far less sweeping than their detractors allege. No other new details about the plots or the countries involved were part of the newly declassified information released to Congress on Saturday and made public by the Senate Intelligence Committee. The NSA Threat Operations Center: Hundreds of millions of records of U.S. phone calls were collected under a provision of the Patriot Act with just only 300 'queried' in 2012 for additional information about the callers . Intelligence officials said they are working to declassify the dozens of plots NSA chief Gen. Keith Alexander said were disrupted, to show Americans the value of the programs, but that they want to make sure they don't inadvertently reveal parts of the U.S. counterterrorism playbook in the process. The release of information follows a bruising week for U.S. intelligence officials who testified on Capitol Hill, defending programs that were unknown to the public - and some lawmakers - until they were revealed by a series of media stories in The Guardian and The Washington Post newspapers, leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who remains in hiding in Hong Kong. Edward Snowden: He told the South China Morning Post this week that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had led more than 61,000 hacking operations worldwide, including many in Hong Kong and mainland China . Support: Hundreds of people in Hong Kong have marched to the US consulate in support of ex-CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The protesters demanded that local authorities protect Mr Snowden, who is in hiding in Hong Kong . The disclosures have sparked debate and legal action against the Obama administration by privacy activists who say the data collection goes far beyond what was intended when expanded counterterrorism measures were authorized by Congress after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Intelligence officials said Saturday that both NSA programs are reviewed every 90 days by the secret court authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under the program, the records, showing things like time and length of call, can only be examined for suspected connections to terrorism, they said. The officials offered more detail on how the phone records program helped the NSA stop a 2009 al-Qaida plot to blow up New York City subways. Gen. Keith B. Alexander, director of the National Security Agency and head of the U.S. Cyber Command: He defended the internet and telephone data snooping programmes, saying they had disrupted dozens of terror plots . They say the program helped them track a co-conspirator of al-Qaida operative Najibullah Zazi - though it's not clear why the FBI needed the NSA to investigate Zazi's phone records because the FBI would have had the authority to gather records of Zazi's phone calls after identifying him as a suspect, rather than relying on the sweeping collection program. In revealing some of the foiled plots, the NSA has also acknowledged in a new classified briefing that it does not need court authorization to listen to domestic phone calls. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, disclosed this week that during a secret briefing to members of Congress, he was told that the contents of a phone call could be accessed 'simply based on an analyst deciding that.' If the NSA wants 'to listen to the phone,' an analyst's decision is sufficient, without any other legal authorization required, Nadler said he learned. 'I was rather startled,' said Nadler, an attorney and congressman who serves on the House Judiciary committee. Defense: Intelligence officials have insisted agents do not listen in on Americans' telephone conversations and maintain the internet communications surveillance programmer targeted only non-Americans located outside of the US . Not only does this disclosure shed more light on how the NSA's formidable eavesdropping apparatus works domestically it also suggests the Justice Department has secretly interpreted federal surveillance law to permit thousands of low-ranking analysts to eavesdrop on phone calls. The same legal standards that apply to phone calls also apply to e-mail messages, text messages, and instant messages. The disclosure appears to confirm some of the allegations made by Edward Snowden, a former NSA infrastructure analyst who leaked classified documents to the Guardian. Snowden said in a video interview that, while not all NSA analysts had this ability, he could from Hawaii 'wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president.' Supporting Snowden: Hong Kong's government says it does not comment on individual cases but will follow any request according to the law. Analysts say any attempts to bring Mr Snowden to America may take months and could be blocked by Beijing . Earlier reports have indicated that the NSA has the ability to record nearly all domestic and international phone calls -- in case an analyst needed to access the recordings in the future. Wlliam Binney, a former NSA technical director who helped to modernize the agency's worldwide eavesdropping network, told the Daily Caller this week that the NSA records the phone calls of 500,000 to 1 million people who are on its so-called target list, and perhaps even more. 'They look through these phone numbers and they target those and that's what they record,' Binney said. Former FBI counterterrorism agent Tim Clemente told CNN last month that, in national security investigations, the bureau can access records of a previously made telephone call. 'All of that stuff is being captured as we speak whether we know it or like it or not,' he said. Clemente added in an appearance the next day that, thanks to the 'intelligence community' -- an apparent reference to the NSA -- 'there's a way to look at digital communications in the past.' NSA Director Keith Alexander said this week that his agency's analysts abide by the law: ""They do this lawfully. They take compliance oversight, protecting civil liberties and privacy and the security of this nation to their heart every day.""","President Obama will discuss surveillance programs at next week's G-8 summit .

Speaking ahead of tomorrowâs royal christening, the Most Rev Justin Welby said three-month-old Prince George was âan amazing giftâ for proud parents William and Kate. The Queen, Prince Charles and other senior members of the Royal Family are expected to join the couple at the private ceremony, which will be led by the Archbishop at the Chapel Royal at St Jamesâs Palace in London. Prince Harry and Kateâs family - parents Carole and Michael Middleton and her siblings Pippa and James - are also expected to attend but the Princess Royal and the Countess of Wessex have been omitted from the 60-strong guest list. William and Kate, both 31, were said to want an âintimateâ ceremony with their family and friends, and there has been speculation that the godparents will be close friends rather than grandees. Prince Harryâs girlfriend Cressida Bonas, 24, is not understood to be among the guests and it is not known if Pippaâs stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson will attend. The Archbishop said Prince Georgeâs birth in July had prompted an âextraordinaryâ celebration around the world. He said: âWe celebrate, first of all, the joy of the parents. It is a wonderful thing, having a baby. All babies are unbelievably special, not only royal babies.â He added: âOne of the things Iâm sure about is that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Georgeâs parents have had so much advice that they could probably fill a house with it. âMy message to them would be, what a treat, what an amazing gift, what wonderful times that you will have. âThere will be great times and tough times, there always are with children.â The Archbishop said he would baptise Prince George by splashing his head three times with water rather than by dipping his head into the font. His five-minute film about baptism has been put on YouTube and the Lambeth Palace website in the hope that Georgeâs christening will lead other couples to consider having their children baptised.

The chapel was also the venue for Kateâs confirmation into the Church of England in 2011, in a secret ceremony before her marriage. Built by Henry VIII in 1531, it has a ceiling decorated by Hans Holbein to honour the monarchâs short-lived fourth marriage to Anne of Cleves.

Gifted: Emahoy TseguÃ©-Mariam GuebrÃ¹ has spent almost her entire life shut away in a convent kept company by her two passions - God and music . 'It is classical music, with a very special sense of time, space, scenery,' Dunietz told the Guardian. 'It's not grand; it's intimate, natural, honest and very feminine. She has a magical touch on the piano. It's delicate but deep. And all her compositions tell stories of time and place.' Guebru has spent the last 70 years penning a vast musical opus that has, until . now, barely been heard outside the convent.Â  Instead it has been left to fade in plastic shopping bags tucked away . in her cramped living quarters. 'Honest and very feminine': Despite her cloistered existence, she is now on the brink of global stardom after Israeli classical musician Maya Dunietz (pictured) heard a rare CD of her work, and was so impressed that she turned it into a book . Despite there being only a handful of . recordings of Guebru's work, Ms Dunietz first heard a sample . when her husband brought back a CD he found in a London record shop. Upon hearing the music, she immediately set out to track the nun down to find out what else she had composed. 'We listened and were amazed by the strange combination of classical, Ethiopian and blues,' said Dunietz. 'And then we read the sleeve notes and discovered she lives right here in Jerusalem.' Guebru began life as a member of the Ethiopian aristocracy in Addis Ababa with close ties to Emperor Haile Selassie. Born with the name Yewubdar GuebrÃ¹ on December 12 1923, she lived there until, at the age of six, she and her sister were sent to a Swiss boarding school where she got her first taste of classical music. By her late teens she had been offered a place at a prestigious music school in London. But, due to the turmoil that had spread across her homeland, she was denied to leave by the Ethiopian authorities. In protest at her detention, she went on hunger strike until, nearing death, she turned to God and took her first Holy Communion. She gave up music and devoted herself to religion, moving to a remote monastery in northern Ethiopia where she spent the next ten years living barefoot in a mud and stone hut. It was not until she rejoined her mother in Addis Ababa that she took up music again and soon recorded a handful of albums. In 1984, after the death of her mother, she moved to Jerusalem to take up residence at the Ethiopian Orthodox Church where she has remained ever since. Cloistered life: Guebru has spent the last 70 years penning a vast musical opus that has, until now, barely been heard, left instead to fade in plastic shopping bags tucked away in her nunnery quarters in the convent (pictured) It was there that Dunietz tracked her down, sitting at her piano. After years of visits and silent bonding ('We felt there was a lot of longing and sorrow and loneliness'), Dunietz finally persuaded her to hand over her work to turn into a book. 'She handed over four plastic bags â old wrinkled Air Ethiopia bags â containing hundreds of pages, all muddled up, a big mess, written in pencil, some of them 60 or 70 years old,' Dunietz told the Guardian. 'It was all the pages of her music that she had found in her room. ""Make a book"", she said.' Enlisting the help of the Jerusalem Season of Culture, which organises an annual summer festival of art, music and food in the city, Dunietz finally completed the painstaking task of organising and publishing the opus. Musical ambiance: Easter celebrations outside the Ethiopian Orthodox church in Jerusalem, where GuebrÃ¹ has lived since 1984 . The book begins with a foreword from Meytal Ofer, a regular visitor to Guebru. 'I enter a darkened room and . catch my first glimpse of her, an elderly woman, not a wrinkle on her . face, lying in bed,' Ofer writes. 'It is a modest room with a small window. In the room . is a bed, a piano, piles of musical scores and a picture of Haile . Selassie and the Empress Menen hung above the papers. 'Emahoy . Tsegue-Mariam is in her own world; she speaks slowly with an inner . peace, her soothing voice caresses the listener and her infectious smile . sneaks into the conversation every now and then [...] . 'The disparity between . the room's sparseness and Emahoy TseguÃ©-Mariam's spiritual richness . reaches deep down into my soul.' The performance on Tuesday will feature a host of professional musicians, led by Duniet, play a selection of Guebru's music. Guebru is said to have found her new fame somewhat overwhelming and has spent most of her time locked in the nunnery, refusing media requests.","Emahoy TseguÃ©-Mariam GuebrÃ¹ rarely ever leaves convent in Jerusalem .

The party practice of 'assault militias' would see Golden Dawn supporters ride in pairs on motorcycles, brandishing sticks, and striking 'all the Pakistanis they could see', according to a report. The evidence of the extreme right-wing party's culture of racial violence came to light mere days after the leader of Golden Dawn was arrested on charges of forming a criminal organisation. Extreme violence: Former members of Greek extreme-right ultra nationalist party Golden Dawn have revealed party's systematic violent attacks on immigrants (file photo) In a court testimony published yesterday, one former Golden Dawn supporter spoke of 'military style' training of party members and of the 'assault militias' as a regular occurrence. âI took part several times in activities involving 50 or 60 motorbikes, with two people on each.

Last week, police arrested the controversial party's leader Nikos Michaloliakos and five other Golden Dawn MPs, including party spokesman Ilias Kassidiaris, amid high tensions following the murder of a left-wing rapper by a Golden Dawn supporter. Described as âa neo-Nazi party with a history of violence which makes Nick Griffin look like Julie Andrews,â by New Statesman writer Alex Andreou, Golden Dawn began systemised attacks as early as 1987. They initially targeted immigrants, before turning against Greek-born nationals who disagreed with the party's extreme-right opinions, the report said.

With the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination just over a month away, the New Hampshire-based auction house RR Auction is getting ready to put on sale 30 historical artifactsÂ  connected to Oswald, including photographs, postcards, letters, and even his Iver Johnson revolver. The crown jewel of the collection is Oswaldâs 14-karat gold wedding band engraved with the Communist symbols of hammer and sickle that was locked away in a safe of a Fort-Worth, Texas, law firm for nearly half a century before it was returned to the assassinâs widow, Marina Oswald Porter. Assassin's ring: A wedding band worn by Lee Harvey Oswald until just hours before he killed President John F. Kennedy will be sold at auction this month . Soviet bling: The 14-karat gold wedding band engraved with the Communist symbols of a star and hammer and sickle (right) was purchased by Oswald in Minsk in 1961 . Newlywed: The ring could be seen on Lee Harvey Oswald's right hand as he poses with Marina Oswald for their wedding photo on April 30, 1961 . Seeking closure: Marina Oswald Porter, seen here in Minsk shortly after her wedding in 1961, explained in a five-page handwritten letter accompanying the ring that she has decided to sell it because she wants nothing to do with November 22, 1963 . The ring was purchased in a jewellery store in Minsk, Belarus, before Oswald's marriage to 19-year-old Marina Prusakova on April 30, 1961 â just two months after the two had first met. According to Marina, her husband left the ring on a night table next to her bed at Ruth Paineâs house in Irving, Texas, on November 22, 1963 - the day he set out for Dallas to kill the president at Dealey Plaza. Following Oswaldâs arrest, the ring was given to the U.S. Secret Service by Paine, and then to Fort Worth lawyer Forrest Markward, of the firm Brackett and Ellis. Marina Oswald was reunited with her long-deceased husband's wedding band last year when it was discovered among Markward's files after his death.

Oswald's wedding band is among the priciest items on the auction block, with the starting bid set at $2,500. Whoever ends up buying the ring will also receive a five-page handwritten letter from Marina, dated May 5, 2013, in which she lays out the history of the ring from the time of its purchase to the morning of November 22, 1963, which Oswaldâs widow describes as âthe worst day of my life.â In the missive, the 72-year-old Marina Oswald Porter also talks about her appearance in front of the Warren Commission tasked with investigating the assassination, which suggested that Oswald may have been conveying a secret message by leaving the ring behind.

"One in five men in Britain die from a heart attack compared to just one in seven women . By . Sophie Borland . UPDATED: . 05:39 EST, 12 August 2011 . Around one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women . The sex hormone oestrogen protects women from heart attacks and may explain why they are far less likely to be struck down than men, claim scientists. They have discovered that this naturally-occurring chemical helps stop blood cells sticking to the walls of arteries and forming potentially fatal blockages. Researchers from Queen Mary at the University of London think their findingsÂ  may explain why women are far more likely to suffer heart attacks after the menopause, when their oestrogen levels decline. Around one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women. But while very few women suffer heart attacks before their 50s, the risk suddenly increases after the menopause when they are just as likely to be struck down than men. Until recently experts have struggled to explain why younger women are less likely to develop heart disease and suffer heart attacks. Now research published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology claims that the hormone oestrogen may protect them. But experts say their findings do not necessarily mean that oestrogen couldÂ  ever be used in drugs to prevent heart disease. The hormone is known to increase the risk of certain types of cancer. Dr Suchita Nadkarni from the William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary,Â  University of London, who led the research, said: 'Weâve shown a clear relationship between oestrogen levels and the behaviour of these white blood cells. Researchers from Queen Mary at the University of London, pictured, think their findings may explain why women are far more likely to suffer heart attacks after the menopause, when their oestrogen levels decline . 'Our results suggest that oestrogen helps maintain the delicate balance between fighting infections, and protecting arteries from damage that can lead to cardiovascular disease. 'Understanding how the body fights heart disease naturally is vital forÂ  developing new treatments.' Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the British HeartÂ  Foundation said: 'We know that womenâs health is partly protected by oestrogen. After menopauseÂ  â when oestrogen levels drop dramatically â coronary heart disease rates riseÂ  steeply. Itâs not yet clear quite how this protection occurs. 'This study suggests that oestrogen has another role. The hormone seems toÂ  affect womenâs response to infection and injury, by preventing white bloodÂ  cells from moving out of the blood stream into tissues. This reducesÂ  inflammation, part of the immune systemâs rapid response.'","The sex hormone helps stop blood cells sticking to artery walls and forming blockages .

"PUBLISHED: . 15:44 EST, 4 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:06 EST, 5 December 2013 . Women's legs have got Lululemon in trouble again after a Maryland store posted a poem in its window rhyming 'apple pies' with 'rubbing thighs.' The controversial display in the yoga-wear brand's Bethesda store comes just weeks after the company's founder suggested his customers' ample thighs were responsible for their pants being see-through. The poem, which reads: 'Cups of Chai/Apple Pies/Rubbing thighs?' was spotted by an outraged onlooker at a store in Bethesda, who then tweeted it, prompting Lululemon to apologize and take it down. 'We're deeply sorry, the display is being taken down. We celebrate that thighs rub together - ours do too,' the company wrote online. Thighs: Just weeks after Lululemon's founder complained women's fat legs were responsible for their pants being see-through, a Bethesda, Maryland, store, pictured, has posted a poem about 'rubbing thighs' in its window . The dispay was removed Monday night, according to the New York Daily News. The store is believed to be the same place an assistant bludgeoned, choked and stabbed-to-death a co-worker in March 2011 because she was trying to steal some yoga pants. Lululemon founder Chip Wilson was forced to apologize in mid November for suggesting that women's heavy thighs were to blame for a line of yoga pants being recalled earlier this year because they were too sheer. In a video posted on the company YouTube, Wilson says: 'I'm sad for the people at Lululemon... that have really had to face the brunt of my actions. I take responsibility for all that has occurred and the impact it has had on you. I'm sorry to have put you all through this.' A week earlier he sparked outrage for saying in a Bloomberg interview about Lululemon's faulty yoga pants: 'Frankly, some women's bodies just don't actually work.' Regret: 'I'm sad for the people at Lululemon.... that have really had to face the brunt of my actions. I take responsibility for all that has occurred and the impact it has had on you. I'm sorry to have put you all through this' Wilson, along with his co-founder and wife Shannon Wilson, made the remarks as their company released its Full-On Luon pants, a style which claims to have 'major support and coverage'. When speaking about how some . customers complained about the pants' fabric pilling, Wilson . continued: 'It's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much . pressure is there over a period of time and how much they use it.' In his apology video, Wilson looks earnestly at the camera, seemingly emotional as he expresses his regret. 'I'm sad. I'm really sad. I'm sad for the repercussions of my actions,' he says. He then takes a deep breath as he appeals to loyal customers to have faith in the company. 'For all of you that have made Lululemon what it is today, I ask you to stay in a conversation that is above the fray,' he says. 'I ask you to prove that the culture that you have built cannot be chipped away. Thank you.' Comeback: Lululemon has released an ad for Full-On Luon pants, a new style which claims to have 'major support and coverage' - unlike the pants that were pulled from shelves in March for being too sheer . Comment that caused a backlash: Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, pictured with his wife Shannon, said that some women's bodies 'don't work' for Lululemon yoga pants . The founder's controversial remarks . caused Bloomberg TV host Trish Regan to cut in and ask: 'Interesting, . not every woman can wear a Lululemon yoga pant?' Wilson responded: 'No, I think they can. I just think it's how you use it.' The . apology video has been viewed more than 98,000 times, eliciting a . variety of reactions from viewers, with some saying it is seems somewhat . insincere. One commenter wrote: '""I'm sad"" and ""I'm sorry"" are different things.' Another . said: 'Wow, that was one of the most unapologetic apologies I've heard . in a while.Â  You're not sorry for what you said, but only sorry that it . caused some issue'. WATCH: A message from Chip Wilson, Lululemon founder . In March, the Canadian company was forced to recall 17 per cent of its yoga pants due to an . unacceptable 'level of sheerness' created during the manufacturing . process. At the time, the . company said that it was not sure why the pants were so sheer since they . hadn't changed the materials used or switched manufacturers. The . scandal damaged its reputation and reportedly cost the company over . $20 million, and in June CEO Christine Day announced that she would be . stepping down after five-and-a-half years. In a very stylized video for new yoga . pants, lead yoga designer Antonia delicately touches on the subject, . saying: 'We saw that there was an opportunity to take the fabric and . evolve it to another place.' Fine details: The leggings, which range in price from $72 to $98 per pair, 'involved a lot of people to develop,' says lead yoga designer Antonia as the camera pans to a close-up of yarn and machinery . Revamped: Full-On Luon leggings (left, $83 and . right, $98) were launched in response to this year's too-sheer leggings . scandal, which reportedly cost the company over $20million . Full-On Luon leggings, which range in price from $72 to $98 per pair, 'involved a lot of people to develop,' she says, adding: 'It . took over two-and-a-half years.' The camera shows a close-up of yarn and machinery as dramatic music plays in the background. 'In developing it we had to look at . everything from where the yarn was coming from, how it was being . knitted, the construction, the mills that we work with,' she explains. Shots of women practicing various yoga poses in the pants show that they do indeed seem to maintain their opacity. Joan, VP of global product quality, explains in the ad: 'In the testing of the product . there's probably 13 to 15 tests that go on. Every single lot of the . fabric is tested before it leaves the mill.' And materials innovation director Yogendra elaborates about the seemingly painstaking process of constructing the fabric, saying: 'We use special very fine microfiber yarns with a very special yarn construction' Still dissatisfied: One customer wrote: 'They pill and the thread in the seams loosens. I want to love these pants so bad. . . but honestly, my $15 Walmart pants are WAY better quality' Later he adds: 'We made this fabric 55 different ways to . come to our current formulation that would give us one of the best . fabrics in the industry.' While the video claims that these new . pants are made from a more supportive and opaque fabric, many of the reviews on the . Lululemon website would suggest otherwise. One dissatisfied customer wrote: 'They pill and the thread in the seams loosens. I want to love these pants so bad. . . but honestly, my $15 Walmart pants are WAY . better quality.' Another complained that the pants are just as see-through as their predecessors. 'After wearing four times I'm already experiencing pilling and sheerness,' she wrote. 'I am upset because spending so much money on leggings I expected them to be much better quality.' A spokesperson told Reuters that only a very small number of customers has complained and that 'guest feedback is not indicative of a larger issue'.","A Maryland store has posted the controversial poem 'Cups of Chai/Apple Pies/Rubbing thighs?' in its window .

Resplendent in beautifully embroidered dove-grey silk and a striking Phillip Treacey fascinator, the Duchess of Cornwall looked every inch the royal bride when she married Prince Charles in 2005. Now the Duchess' stunning Anna Valentine gown is to be the centrepiece of an exhibition opening next Spring at the V&A. What's more, the Duchess of Cornwall wasn't the only aristocratic bride to dust off her nuptial frock for the show. Fit for a Queen: Camilla in her Anna Valentine gown (left) and Lady Mary Charteris in a daring Pam Hogg frock . Pink lady: Gwen Stefani plumped for a rose-flushed John Galliano designed gown for her 2004 wedding . Also included is the flesh-flashing Pam Hogg frock worn by Lady Mary Charteris to her 2012 marriage to Big Pink frontman, Robbie Furze, and a truly spectacular white silk-satin gown with an 18ft train sported by Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, on her big day in 1933. Other highlights include the dip-dyed pink and ivory John Galliano-designed dress worn by Gwen Stefani to her 2004 wedding to Gavin Rossdale and the unusual purple silk frock in which Dita von Teese married shock-rocker Marylin Manson. The gowns will join dresses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries for the exhibition, entitled Wedding Dresses 1775 - 2014, which opens in May. According to curators, the exhibition will trace the development of the fashionable white wedding dress, which, as some might be surprised to discover, wasn't always the most popular choice. 'The wealthiest women in the 18th century tended to wear fabrics woven with metal thread,' Edwina Ehrman, the show's curator, told the Telegraph. Stunning: Margaret Whigham in her Norman Hartnell gown ahead of her 1933 wedding to the Duke of Argyll . Elegant: Katie Shillingford's Gareth Pugh designed pale grey slashed chiffon wedding dress and veil . Fancy footwork: A pair of silk and leather shoes worn by Phyllis Blaiberg for her wedding in London in 1914 . 'White was a secondary choice, and not because of any associations with chastity. It showed status because it was expensive to have a white dress.' Typical of the wedding frocks worn in the 18th century is the ravishing silk brocade gown worn by a wealthy woman named Jane Bailey to her 1780 marriage to James Wickham. Equally impressive is the lavishly frilled, embroidered and furbelowed dress sported by New York heiress Cara Leland Huttleston Rogers at her wedding to Bradford Ferris Duff in 1890. But although cream and pale shades of gold and yellow proved popular with 18th century brides, white didn't truly become de rigeur until well into the next century. 'Really though, the only difference between a wedding dress and a fashion dress was the trimmings,' added Miss Erhmann. 'After they were married, brides would take the trimmings off and wear it again.' Wedding Dresses 1775 - 2014 opens at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from next May and runs until March 2015.

Cancer survival rates in Britain still lag well behind many other European countries, a study shows.Survival rates for nine out of ten common cancers are lower than the European average, despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment. And the discrepancy is even worse among elderly sufferers. Patients with nearly all forms of the disease are more likely to die in Britain compared with patients in France, Germany, Spain and Scandinavia. Our survival rates for cancers such as breast, prostate, bowel and lung are on a par with former states of the Eastern bloc including Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The figures suggest that age discrimination for cancer treatment is worse in Britain compared to elsewhere in Europe. UK survival rates for cancers such as breast, prostate, bowel and lung are on a par with former states of the Eastern bloc including Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia . There is increasing concern that sufferers in their 70s and 80s are being written off by doctors.Ciaran Devane, chief executive at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: âThis is truly depressing. One in two of us will get cancer in our lifetime so this is a big deal and has to be a wake-up call for the NHS. There is no reason why the UK should lag . behind the rest of Europe when it comes to either certain cancers or . survival rates for older cancer patients.â The new data is from a major European study of 10million cancer patients in 29 countries between 2000 and 2008. For breast cancer, it found that British women have a 79 per cent chance of surviving five years, compared with 86 per cent in France, 87 per cent in Finland, 85 per cent in Norway and 82 per cent on average. Only 9 per cent of lung cancer patients in the UK live beyond five years, compared with the 13 per cent average, 17 per cent in Austria and 15 per cent in Sweden. For prostate cancer, just under 81 per cent of patients in Britain live beyond five years. The rate is 90 per cent in Finland and 89 per cent in France. Around 68 per cent of over-75s with breast cancer survive beyond five years, compared with 75 per cent across Europe. About 45 per cent of men over 85 with prostate cancer live for at least five years. The average is 58 per cent. Researchers are unclear as to why our survival rates are so much lower but it may be because the disease is often diagnosed too late when it has spread to other organs. It might be that GPs are missing certain symptoms while at the same time patients are reluctant to make appointments as they donât want to be a nuisance. But NHS England, which runs the health service, said the data, published in the Lancet, showed some improvements â particularly in lung and skin cancer. Over the past 13 years the NHS has invested millions on various cancer strategies to improve diagnosis rates and make the public more aware of symptoms. Sean Duffy, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England said: âThese reports show that we are making real inroads into improving cancer survival in England. âFor example, the improvement in survival in lung cancer has been dramatic over the last 20 years with almost twice as many patients alive a year after diagnosis now as was the case in 1990 and we can see that for melanoma (skin cancer) that the survival for England â 85.3 per cent â is better than the European average, 83.2 per cent.â But Drew Lindon, head of policy at Prostate Cancer UK, said: âThere is a shadow to this story.

A little boy will be able to eat chocolate again this Christmas after he received a new kidney from his father. William Balestrini, three, will be able to tuck into the treat after recovering from a rare condition which made it dangerous for him to eat it. William, from Crawley, West Sussex, was born with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease â ARPKD - but has now recovered thanks to a kidney transplant. William Balestrini, three, has autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease which causes cysts to form of the kidneys damaging the tissue. In severe cases, it leads to kidney failure . His condition stopped him from eating a variety of foods including chocolate, cheese and yoghurt. This is because they contain minerals, such as phosphate, which his failing kidneys were unable to clear from his body. Too much phosphate can cause the . parathyroid gland to secrete a hormone which causes calcium to be . leached out of the bones causing rickets, poor growth and bone . fractures. William's mother, Nancy Rattner, 24, said: âIt was difficult, because he was so poorly and the only foods he wanted to eat were foods that would harm him. 'We are going all out this Christmas and I just cannot wait. âTo be able to watch Will really enjoy himself, and tuck into his favourite treats is going to be fantastic. William had to have a very restricted diet as his failing kidneys were not able to filter excess minerals from his body. He is now able to eat normally after receiving a new kidney from his father . William's parents, Nancy and James, were told before his birth that he might have kidney problems as a scan showed that the organs were slightly enlarged . âI've already put the decorations up and I can't wait to spoil Will and his brother. âBefore . the op Will could barely eat anything - it was hard, because he used to . get given chocolate all the time and couldn't eat it. But now, he loves . the stuff. âIt's great to see him tucking into his favourite food now and really enjoying it. âThis Christmas will be the first year he eats a Christmas dinner too â we can't wait.â Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a rare genetic childhood condition which causes cysts to grow in the kidneys and damage them. Symptoms of ARPKD include high blood pressure, kidney disease and liver disease. In the most severe cases, children with the condition do not survive for more than a few weeks. Children with less severe ARPKD sometimes lose all of their kidney function by their teens. If this happens, they will need either dialysis or a transplant. It is estimated that one in 20,000 babies are born with the condition. Children with ARPKD are often unable to eat a wide range of foods, including chocolate, because their failing kidneys are unable to filter excess minerals from their bodies. Of particular concern are phosphate-rich foods because excess phosphate can build up in the blood of people with kidney failure. This is serious because it causes the parathyroid gland to secrete a hormone caused PTH which causes calcium to be leached out of bones. This can cause rickets, poor growth and bone fractures. Source: NHS Choices . Ms Rattner and partner James, 32, discovered their oldest son might have a kidney condition at their 23 week scan. Ms Rattner said: âWe knew Will may be ill very early on, as scans showed that his kidneys were slightly enlarged. âBut none of the doctors could say for sure, and there was a nine out of ten chance that he would be ok. âWhen he was born, he seemed fine and the initial tests were clear, so we thought we were lucky.â But at just 14 hours old, little Will took a turn for the worse. Ms Rattner said: âI was trying to feed him and all of a sudden he went blue and started to shake. âWe were then told that he had low blood sugar and had some sort of kidney problem. âIt was devastating. He was hooked up to loads of machines and you could actually feel his kidneys through his stomach. âOur lives suddenly took a dramatic turn and it soon became clear that he wasn't well at all.â William was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital where his parents were told the shocking news that their son had ARPKD, and he may need a kidney transplant. The potentially fatal condition causes cysts to appear in the kidneys damaging them. It can also cause damage to the liver. Ms Rattner said: âWe just couldn't believe it. âI'd been told that going to Great Ormond Street would be the last resort, and then here we were. Everything was just crashing around me.â Luckily, doctors were able to stabilise William, increasing his kidney function. William (pictured with his parents, Nancy and James, and his brother, Arthur) was diagnosed with ARPKD after he turned blue and started shaking when he was just a few hours old . William (pictured after his transplant) received a new kidney when he was just two years old. Both of his parents were eligible to donate but his mother, Nancy, became pregnant with his brother . His mother said: âEventually we were discharged and for eight months everything was fine. âBut after one of his check-ups we were told he was getting worse again. âWe rushed back to hospital and Will was transferred to the pre-transplant clinic. âI looked at my little baby and just couldn't believe he needed such a huge operation.â Ms Rattner said: 'It was a very scary time. To watch them both go through surgery was just petrifying. I had to say goodbye to Will on my own as James was in theatre and it was awful' Immediately, his parents began investigations to determine whether they could donate their own kidneys to their little boy. Both were a match, but Ms Rattner became pregnant with the couple's second child, Arthur, so it was decided that her partner should donate. In October last year, when Will was just two years old, the toddler and his father underwent surgery. Ms Rattner said: âIt was a very scary time. To watch them both go through surgery was just petrifying. âI had to say goodbye to Will on my own as James was in theatre and it was awful. I gave him a little kiss and a cuddle - I was so emotional. âIt was all a bit of a blur to be honest but they both did so well, I'm so proud of them.â The transplant was a success and William was out of hospital in ten days, but due to follow up tests over Christmas, the family never got to celebrate. Ms Rattner said: âWe were in hospital on Christmas Eve, so the festive period wasn't too fun for us last year. âFor the first six months after the operation I was always on edge, worried that something would go wrong again. âBut this year, it's going to be different - I can't wait to spoil Will after all he's been through. âThere's a chance that he might be lactose intolerant but we'll find a way around it, I can't deprive him of chocolate again.â Ms Rattner says this year she is determined to spoil William at Christmas to make up for everything he has been through . Tess Harris, chairman of the Polycystic Kidney Disease Charity, said: âIt's a rare inherited condition, inherited from parents who are carriers. âARPKD is a severe disease but about 8 in 10 babies who survive the first four weeks of life are still alive at five years old. Research continues into finding new therapies but is hampered by lack of funding by government. âSufferers of it feel unwell, have tiredness. Anaemia is also a big problem and very high blood pressure can bring risk of heart disease and a stroke. âThey may also need dialysis treatment as the kidneys stop doing its job removing toxins from the blood.â","William Balestrini was born with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease - it causes cysts to develop on the kidneys damaging the tissue .

British mobile phone customers on Three can now call home and use the internet when holidaying in the U.S for no extra cost. America is one of four new countries the mobile operator has added to its Feel at Home roaming scheme that launched in August. Travellers heading to Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Macau can also now use their call plan in the same way they would at home, without paying a premium, and this takes the total number of locations on the scheme up to 11. Three customers can now call home and use the internet when holidaying in the U.S. (Brooklyn Bridge in New York pictured) for no extra cost. America is one of four new countries, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Macau, the operator has added to its Feel at Home roaming scheme . Three has begun rolling out its 4G network. Select customers with 4G-ready devices can now use . the service when in an area with 4G coverage. This rollout will continue to other customers throughout . January, and all customers with a compatible device should be able to access 4G by the end of March. Three aims to cover 50 cities with 4G by the end of 2014 and 98 per cent of the population by the end of 2015. Other countries that were already covered by the scheme include Republic of Ireland, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong . Kong, Sweden and Denmark. The service will automatically activate as soon as the phone enters any of these countries and picks up a local network. It is hoped the move will spark a war among mobile phone network providers to let people use their phones abroad without worrying about the consequences. The Government plans to scrap roaming charges in the EU by 2016, although no set plans are in place for when exactly this will happen. This will of course mean holidaymakers travelling outside of this jurisdiction will still face high bills, though. Three's Feel at Home scheme is now available in eleven countries and it is hoped the move could lead to the scrapping of international roaming charges elsewhere. Holidaymakers in Ireland, Australia, Italy (Rome's Colosseum is pictured left) Hong Kong, Sweden (right) and Denmark can also use the service from today . Three describes the scheme as âa new, simple and affordable way to stay in touch with friends and family back home while travelling overseasâ. Customers with pay monthly contracts, pay-as-you-go and SIM-only packages, mobile broadband and business plans can use the service. However, customers who exceed their minutes or data allowance included in their price plan while abroad in any one of the seven countries will be subject to reduced roaming rates. People who make a call to a non-UK number will still be charged at the full roaming rate and tethering is not allowed under the scheme. Commenting on the news, Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline: 'For too long, despite worldwide caps being in place and networks offering special packages to help keep a lid on roaming costs, holidaying Brits have faced coming home to the souvenir from hell - an eye-watering phone bill.

There was information and things to be learned... and without . his co-operation it would go no where.' The Parkers said the meeting was encouraged by Mr Lanza. A day after the killings, Robbie Parker spoke to the media and expressed his condolences for Peter Lanza, his son Ryan and their relatives, and Lanza had appreciated these words, Robbie said. 'We felt like an olive branch had been extended for us to get together and speak and just talk as parents,' Robbie Parker told CBS. 'Closure': They met Peter Lanza (left), the father of gunman Adam Lanza (right), a month after the killings . Sorrow: The Parkers told CBS Mr Lanza seemed grateful to have someone to talk to . Mr Parker, who revealed that his . other two young daughters still cry over missing Emilie, said that the . meeting was 'very emotional as you can imagine'. 'We . definitely expressed our condolences for one another and we felt he was . very receptive,' Mr Parker said. 'I got the impression he was very . grateful for the chance to speak to somebody.' While . the Parkers did not share any insights Mr Lanza gave them into his . son's medical history or problems at home, they said they believe more . information is yet to emerge. They . added that, while they are not angry at Mr Lanza, they do hold him . partly accountable for the horror their son inflicted on December 14 at . Sandy Hook Elementary School. 'We don't hold him solely responsible,' Mrs Parker said. 'I . feel like he's made mistakes. I don't feel he should be responsible for . what happened that day. It was not ultimately his decision to do [it].' Missed: Their oldest daughter Emilie, right, was gunned down on December 14 with 19 other children . Angelic: The Parkers said they do not pay attention to news about Lanza as it does not bring Emilie back . Mrs . Parker also said that she believes Adam's mother Nancy - whom he shot . in the face before going on his rampage at the school and ultimately . taking his own life - was also partly responsible. 'Looking . from the outside in it's hard to think there can't have been things she . didn't see,' Mrs Parker said. 'I'm never going to understand that. 'Do I think it was her fault?I 'm sure there are things shes going to have to be accountable for.' But . they also agreed they spent little time placing blame, as the outcome . would be the same regardless of who they pointed fingers at. Instead, . Mr Parker said they wanted to spend their energy being better parents . to their other two daughters, Madeline and Samantha, who still have 'ups . and downs' about Emilie's absence. Questions: They said their daughters, Samantha and Madeline, still get upset about their big sister . Loss: They said they do not blame Peter Lanza for their daughter's death but believe he is accountable . Talented: The Parkers remember their daughter as artistic and share many of her pictures on their blog . '[Madeline] . starts talking about something that she wished Emilie could have done . with her and she starts crying,' Mr Parker said. 'It's okay to cry.' She added that, when it comes to forgiving Adam, she has decided it is not her burden to bear. 'I do hold him accountable but I feel like God . will determine that,' she said.'He's in a place where the judgment will happen. I don't have to judge him.' Robbie . Parker, who was the first parent to speak out about his murdered child . following the tragedy, said that their family has gone through 'a little . bit of everything' since losing Emilie. 'You went from the absolute . worst experience that you could ever imagine to have to go through as a . parent... to being completely overwhelmed . with outpouring of love and support from so many people,' he told CBS. Struggle: Mrs Parker said she also believes Nancy Lanza, pictured right, is accountable for her son's actions. Nancy Lanza became Adam's first victim when he shot her in the face before driving to the school . Remembered: Emilie's picture appears at a memorial for the children following the massacre . Last . week, it emerged that Adam Lanza kept a 7-ft-long spreadsheet detailing . previous gun massacres, including their death tolls and the weapons . they've used. But the . Parkers, who have continued to meet with detectives since the deaths, . said they just take this new information as it comes before moving on. 'It always brings with it a period of sorrow, pain, and you deal with it and you just move on,' Alissa said. 'The . outcome is still the same, regardless if it was planned, not planned... It doesn't change that our child's . gone.' Speaking live on CNN a day after the massacre, Robbie Parker said that he was praying for the shooter's family and held no anger towards them. He also paid tribute to his slain daughter. Pain: The Parkers are pictured after they found out their daughter had been murdered in December . 'My daughter Emilie would be one of . the first ones giving her love and support to all of the victims, . because thatâs the kind of person she is,' he said, pausing a moment to . take a steadying breath. Grief: Robbie spoke to the press a day after Emilie's death and expressed his condolences for Peter Lanza . 'As the deep pain begins to settle in . our hearts, we find comfort in the incredible person Emilie was and how . many people she was able to touch in her short time on Earth. 'Emilie's . laughter was infectious, and everyone who met her would agree that the . world was a better place because she was in it.' For his part, Peter Lanza has kept a . low profile since the day of the shooting, when a reporter told him that . his son was responsible for the murders. Neighbours of Peter Lanza and Shelley . Cudiner said the pair packed up their car and left their affluent home . in the Stamford suburb of Westover, Connecticut, shortly after being . informed. The news reporter who told Lanza that his son had committed one of the worst mass shootings in American history described the moment in the Stamford Advocate. 'His expression twisted from patient, to surprise to horror,' wrote Maggie Gordon. 'It was obvious that this moment was the first time he had considered his family could be involved.' Peter . Lanza is a vice president of taxes for GE Energy Financial Services and . divorced Nancy Lanza in 2009 due to 'irreconcilable differences.' Remembered: A memorial in Newtown after the shootings shows the names of Lanza's victims . More than a week after the massacre, Peter Lanza collected his son's body and released a statement saying the family was also asking why his son would go on a shooting spree. 'We too are asking why,' he said in a statement. 'Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy. No words can truly express how heartbroken we are.' Twenty children and six adults were killed when Lanza opened fire on the once-peaceful town of Newtown, Connecticut, sending ripples of shock to through the nation and rekindling the gun debate. The grade school shooting was one of the worst in history, second only to the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, where 32 people were shot dead.

Pay-out: Sharon Shoesmith, the social services chief who failed to save the life of Baby P, is to receive Â£600,000 as part of an unfair dismissal claim . The social services chief who failed to save the life of Baby P is to receive a payout of more than Â£600,000, it was reported last night. Sharon Shoesmith, the former head of childrenâs services at Haringey Council, was sacked from her Â£130,000-a year job in 2008 in the wake of a public outcry over the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly. She launched an appeal claiming unfair dismissal and eventually won and last night BBCâs Newsnight reported Haringey has agreed a compensation deal with her. Sources say she will be paid more than Â£600,000, significantly short of the Â£1million figure it had been reported she was seeking. Ed Balls, who was Labour's Children's Secretary when Shoesmith was fired, said the payout left a 'bad taste in the mouth'. Now shadow chancellor, he told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'An independent report said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services. 'They said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that the person who was leading that department and responsible ends up walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money.' The package is much greater than the minimum suggested by senior judge Lord Neuberger in a 2011 ruling in the Court of Appeal. He suggested she was entitled to a minimum of three monthsâ salary plus pensions contributions. Three monthsâ salary would have been Â£33,000. Newsnight also reported that theÂ  council and Shoesmith had signed a confidentiality clause preventing disclosure of the total. One source told Newsnight that Education Secretary Michael Gove was âfuriousâ about the clause, believing it to be âindefensibleâ. Baby Peter died in August 2007 after months of horrific abuse at the hands of his mother Tracey Connelly, 31, her sadistic paedophile boyfriend Steve Barker, 36, and his brother Jason Owen, 40. The family had been visited by professionals including Haringey social workers and doctors 60 times. However, a hearing at The Court of Appeal . concluded Shoesmith had been âunfairly scapegoatedâ and that her . dismissal in December 2008 by Ed Balls, the then Childrenâs Secretary . had been âintrinsically unfair and unlawfulâ. Furious: Michael Gove was angry at an 'indefensible' clause that meant the final payoff will not be disclosed . Lord Neuberger had suggested the Department for Education should contribute to any payout for Shoesmith by her employer Haringey Council. His judgement said: âIt would be entirely appropriate for Haringey to seek a voluntary contribution from the Secretary of State whose unlawful directions gave rise to the problems.â It is understood that the department will meet a proportion of the payout, the details of which were agreed by Haringey Council in the past few days. Lawyers representing Haringey Council and Shoesmith had been in lengthy discussions regarding a payout since the May 2011 ruling. Shoesmith had been due to return to court later this week, seeking a declaration that she remained employed by Haringey Council. That action has now been dropped and the settlement reached between the two parties is understood to be a final one. Tracey Connelly, Barker and Owen, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the childâs death. Earlier this month it was reported that Connelly was due to be released from prison on parole. Charlotte Leslie MP, a member of education select committee that grilled Shoesmith in 2010 said: âItâs very simple, youâve got to ask what responsibility actually means when she was in her position Sharon Shoesmith got a very large salary because she was the head of an organisation which means you take responsibility. Jailed:Â  Baby Peter's mother Tracey Connelly, her paedophile boyfriend Steven Barker, middle, and his brother Jason Owen, right . âShowing leadership means when something goes wrong underneath you take responsibility and make yourself accountable. âI think the thing that people are most angry about is that whistleblowers like Kim Holt who raised all this, also lose their jobs but a lady like Sharon Shoesmith walks away with a very big payoff.â Dr Holt, 54, was forced from her job as the designated doctor for children in care at St Annâs Hospital in Haringey, North London, in 2007, after she and three other doctors wrote to management warning that staff shortages and poor record-keeping would lead to a tragedy. Six months later, her worst fears became reality when an inexperienced doctor who had replaced her at the clinic failed to spot that Baby Peter was the victim of serious physical abuse.","Haringey Council agrees compensation deal with ex-social services chief .

Pictured: Kamran Ajaib, who used Y-fronts to clean his premises, Hamza Poultry Limited in Bristol . A businessman whose filthy makeshift butchers made Â£2 million supplying chicken to takeaways has walked free from court. Kamran Ajaib, 28, used Y-front underpants to clean the premises at Hamza Poultry Limited in Bristol - which had just one 'very dirty' sink for washing hands. Bristol Crown Court heard the brand-new white underclothes were still at the site after it had previously been used as a clothing supplier. Chicken from Hamza Poultry was sold to 60 businesses, including takeaway restaurants, kebab shops and supermarkets in the city and as far afield as Swindon, Cardiff and Swansea. But married father-of-two Ajaibâs processing plant on the Fishponds Trading Estate, Bristol, had none of the necessary food hygiene approvals or licences to work with meat. Environmental health officers from Bristol City Council raided the unmarked site on the Fishponds Trading Estate after a customer at Best Kebab, also in Bristol, found metal wire in a piece of chicken in May 2011. They found a . band saw with meat residue around it, toilets opening straight on to . the only washing area - and brand new pairs of underpants being used as . cleaning cloths. There were also open wheelie bins containing meat debris and bones. Mobile phones and receipts . seized in the raid showed the meat was being distributed across . the south west to what were described in court as âKFC clones and kebab . shopsâ. Pants hygiene standards: The court heard that the Y-fronts, pictured, were 'all new and all clean' but photos of them had turned father-of-two Kamran Ajaib, 28, into 'a laughing stock'. His firm is now in liquidation . Bristol City Council successfully applied for an order from magistrates to destroy more than four tonnes of chicken seized in a raid on the unit in May 2011. The judge said the danger to the public was 'very evident' Judge Michael Roach sentenced Ajaib to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for two years, after he pleaded guilty to eight charges of breaching food hygiene regulations. The Bradford resident was also made to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. But only a fraction of the Â£2,002,672 turned over by the firm will be paid back, as Bristol Crown Court heard Ajaib's current assets are just Â£51,703. That sum must be repaid within six months. The judge said: 'Anybody who looks at the photographs will be enormously dismayed by what they see. The premises are deplorably dirty, they are not fit for meat production, cutting or otherwise. 'The floors are filthy. Thereâs no hot water. The opportunity for those working there to wash their hands or equipment was one very dirty sink unit. 'The public have a right to expect that those who deal with food in the way that you did are authorised and producing their food in a sanitary way. 'The dangers to public health by what you did are very evident.' Iain Macdonald, prosecuting, said: 'Photographs show cleaning cloths, which were in fact underpants. 'It transpired that the previous occupant of the premises had been a supplier of clothing. It appears these were items left at the premises and subsequently used for cleaning purposes.' Four tonnes of chicken and beef were seized from the premises and Ajaib was arrested, Mr Macdonald said. The court heard the business later re-opened as a cold store and operated legally, but was closed in 2012 by Ajaib. Robin Shellard, defending, said: 'The chicken itself was sold from reputable suppliers. This was a bona fide product. 'The product itself was then sold at market rate to regulated restaurants.' The chicken was sent to more than 60 outlets across Bristol and as far afield as Swindon, Cardiff and Swansea. The firm was shopped after a customer found metal wire in a kebab shop takeaway . Filthy: Hamza Poultry Limited in Bristol, from which the chicken was distributed around the south west . He said publicity from previous hearings had a 'devastating effect' on Ajaib and made him a 'laughing stock' due to the y-front rags being used to clean the site. 'The underpants were all new, all clean and they were used as rags,' Mr Shellard explained. He added Ajaib had two children, aged four and two, and helped his wife who had âvery poorâ English. Ajaib had told a previous hearing that he had stepped in at short notice to help his family, saying the chicken arrived in . boxes from European Union-regulated factories and was left in those . boxes. However, he later admitted eight charges of failing to comply with food hygiene regulations, between June 2010 and May 2011. Co-defendant Hamza Poultry Limited, which is in the process of liquidation and of which Ajaib is the sole director and shareholder, also pleaded guilty to the same eight charges. Speaking after the case, John Barrow, principal environmental health officer at Bristol City Council, said: 'When we looked at his invoice books, we found distribution from Carmarthen in west Wales, right along the M4 corridor down to Newport, Monmouthshire, the Forest of Dean, Stroud, Gloucester, Bristol, South Gloucestershire, Swindon and Chippenham.' 'It was a huge area - a total of 60 businesses who were being supplied by this company. It was supplying over 20 tonnes of chicken a week. 'The premises was absolutely disgusting and the risk of contamination from the chicken was really, really high.'","Kamran Ajaib's Bristol firm Hamza Poultry Limited turned over Â£2 million .

A mansion on a super-expensive street nicknamed 'Billionaire's row' has become the UK's most valuable repossession after going on the market for Â£30million. The house, named Dryades, is located in the centre of The Bishops Avenue, a leafy street in North London. But the property, owned by a Pakistani political dynasty, has been seized by the bank after a lengthy High Court battle. Costly: The Â£30million north London home named Dryades, pictured, has been repossessed and is up for sale . Gated: The mansion, on one of London's priciest streets, is set to be knocked down to make way for a replacement . Location: Dryades, outlined in red, has an acre and a half of gardens . The 8,000square-foot home has now been put on the market by the bank for a staggering Â£30million, but plans are already in motion to knock the existing house down and replace it with a giant new home. Planning permission has been granted by Barnet Council for a 46,000square-foot replacement, which could more than triple the present value of the property. The proposed home would boast 21 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms and 12 reception rooms when completed. It will also have an acre and a half of gardens, despite being minutes from the busiest parts of London. The replacement for Dryades will have a staggering 63-metre frontage, and plans are in place for staff quarters, an orangery and a huge centrally-positioned staircase which is reached by walking through a grand vestibule. Other facilities will include an underground level containing a car park, swimming pool, sauna, gym, steam room, billiards room, cinema, bar and bowling alley. Its value could approach Â£100 million mark when completed - making it one of the countryâs most valuable new residences. Super-mansion: Plans have been submitted for the extravagant house planned to replace the one now standing . Replacement: This floor plan shows the layout of the ambitious replacement home planned on the site - which could eventually be worth Â£100million . Extensive: Plans for an underground level show space for a cinema, billiards room, swimming pool and bar . The property was bought for around Â£12,000,000 in 2005 by the family of Pakistanâs former privatisation minister Senator Waqar Ahmed Khan as they looked to invest in the London property market. In 2007 it was used to secure a Â£50million loan with Deutsche Bank, but a lengthy âdebt and possessionâ dispute between both parties resulted in the family losing the home earlier this year. The receivers, Eddisons, has appointed the Knight Frank estate agency to sell Dryades, with the property advertised for Â£29,500,000. It is currently boarded up and its gardens are unmaintained. 'Exceptional value': Estate agents Knight Frank said that the property was worth much more because it is possible to build on it . First among billionaires: If built, the proposed mansion would be the largest house on 'Billionaire's Row' Grant Alexson, head of Knight Frankâs Hampstead office, called Dryades 'an exceptional opportunity'. He said: 'The house, which is currently quite modest, is set in 1.5acres of prime land on The Bishops Avenue. 'The value is in the planning permission. A piece of land like this is worth a lot more if you can build on it. 'It would be the largest home on The Bishops Avenue and one of the largest new homes in the UK. 'It is an exceptional opportunity to buy one of the finest pieces of land on The Bishops Avenue and it is likely to appeal to an international client. 'It has just come onto the market and there is already a lot of interest.' Court battle: Waqar Ahmed Khan went to the High Court over his Â£50million loan from Deutsche Bank . The Â£30million property in north London was repossessed after a pitched legal battle between a senior Pakistani politician and one of the world's most powerful banks. Senator Waqar Ahmed Khan, a former minister in the Pakistani government, is a member of the Khan political dynasty which has included four senators serving at the same time. They took a Â£50million loan with Deutsche Bank against the value of the house. They planned to use the money to redeveloped Dryades, and also to buy another property on The Bishops Avenue. But the bank claimed the loan had fallen into default after the value of the property sank below the outstanding value of the loan, leading to a battle in court to reclaim the money. As well as claiming Dryades from the family, Deutsche Bank also sought possession of a portfolio of six flats in Knightsbridge, central London, worth a total of Â£40million. The family attempted to turn the tables on the bank, however, by claiming that they had withheld some of the money which they had agreed to lend. This, according to the Khans, meant they had been unable to press on with redevelopments and make back enough money to repay the loan. They also claimed the a 'trusted' Deutsche Bank adviser had come to them with the loan proposal in the first place. However, the High Court judge in the case, Mr Justice Hamblen, rejected the defence and the bank won its right to pursue the Khan's for the outstanding loan, plus substantial interest.","Property on exclusive street used to be owned by Pakistani political dynasty .

Â£1million figure it had been reported she was seeking. 'An independent report . said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services,' Mr Balls said today. 'They . said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of . children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth . that the person who was leading that department and responsible ends up . walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money. 'The payout is something that will appal people across the country. What it can't do is bring back a little boy who lost his life because he . was failed by Sharon Shoesmith and that department. That's the truth . and that will never change.' Silence: Haringey Council is refusing to disclose how much the settlement with Ms Shoesmith cost taxpayers . The package is much greater than the minimum suggested by senior judge Lord Neuberger in a 2011 ruling in the Court of Appeal. He suggested she was entitled to a minimum of three monthsâ salary plus pensions contributions. Three monthsâ salary would have been Â£33,000. Newsnight also reported that the council and Shoesmith had signed a confidentiality clause preventing disclosure of the total. One source told Newsnight that Education Secretary Michael Gove was âfuriousâ about the clause, believing it to be âindefensibleâ. Haringey Council continued their silence today and said they were 'unable' to say anything aside from that a deal had been reached. Baby Peter died in August 2007 after months of horrific abuse at the hands of his mother Tracey Connelly, 31, her sadistic paedophile boyfriend Steve Barker, 36, and his brother Jason Owen, 40. The family had been visited by professionals including Haringey social workers and doctors 60 times. However, a hearing at The Court of Appeal . concluded Shoesmith had been âunfairly scapegoatedâ and that her . dismissal in December 2008 by Ed Balls, the then Childrenâs Secretary . had been âintrinsically unfair and unlawfulâ. Furious: Michael Gove was angry at an 'indefensible' clause that meant the final payoff will not be disclosed . Lord Neuberger had suggested the Department for Education should contribute to any payout for Shoesmith by her employer Haringey Council. His judgement said: âIt would be entirely appropriate for Haringey to seek a voluntary contribution from the Secretary of State whose unlawful directions gave rise to the problems.â It is understood that the department will meet a proportion of the payout, the details of which were agreed by Haringey Council in the past few days. Lawyers representing Haringey Council and Shoesmith had been in lengthy discussions regarding a payout since the May 2011 ruling. Shoesmith had been due to return to court later this week, seeking a declaration that she remained employed by Haringey Council. That action has now been dropped and the settlement reached between the two parties is understood to be a final one. Tracey Connelly, Barker and Owen, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the childâs death. Earlier this month it was reported that Connelly was due to be released from prison on parole. Charlotte Leslie MP, a member of education select committee that grilled Shoesmith in 2010 said: âItâs very simple, youâve got to ask what responsibility actually means when she was in her position Sharon Shoesmith got a very large salary because she was the head of an organisation which means you take responsibility. Jailed:Â  Baby Peter's mother Tracey Connelly, her paedophile boyfriend Steven Barker, middle, and his brother Jason Owen, right were all jailed in 2009 for causing the child's death . âShowing leadership means when something goes wrong underneath you take responsibility and make yourself accountable. âI think the thing that people are most angry about is that whistleblowers like Kim Holt who raised all this, also lose their jobs but a lady like Sharon Shoesmith walks away with a very big payoff.â Dr Holt, 54, was forced from her job as the designated doctor for children in care at St Annâs Hospital in Haringey, North London, in 2007, after she and three other doctors wrote to management warning that staff shortages and poor record-keeping would lead to a tragedy. Six months later, her worst fears became reality when an inexperienced doctor who had replaced her at the clinic failed to spot that Baby Peter was the victim of serious physical abuse.","Peter Connelly died in 2007 after abuse under noses of social workers .

They are said to be the closest living species to us humans and share many of our behavioral traits. And it seems that chimpanzees chose their friends in the same way as us too. Scientists from universities in Zurich and Vienna found that, like us, chimpanzees tend to partner up those they have the most in common with. The researchers findings, published in the scientific journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, reveal that chimps choose their friends based on their behavioural and emotional states. I wanna be like you: Chimpanzees make friends according to shared personality traits much like humans . The scientists observed almost 40 primates in two zoos, monitoring who they formed bonds with, who they tended to sit with and what sort of personalities they had. The results suggest that more outgoing friendly chimps tended to make friends with similarly outgoing chimps, while less sociable chimps tended to stick together. Best of friends: The results suggest that more outgoing friendly chimps tended to make friends with similarly outgoing chimps, while less sociable chimps tended to stick together. The finding mirrors the known 'similarity effect' in humans. Jorg Massen, from the University of Vienna, said: 'We found that, especially among unrelated friends, the most sociable and bold individuals preferred the company of other highly sociable and bold individuals, whereas shy and less sociable ones spent time with other similarly aloof and shy chimpanzees.' Sonja Koski of the University of Zurich told Discovery News: 'The groups consisted of many males and females, and individuals formed cooperative friendships. 'Our results suggest that the preference to form these friendships with individuals much like oneself was present in the ancestor of chimpanzees and humans.' Previous studies on other primates such as baboons saw similar results. Earlier this year, scientists discovered more about why chimpanzees strike up such close, yet non-sexual, bonds with other non-related chimps. The team of international researchers found that increased levels of the hormone oxytocin played an intrinsic role in non-kin co-operation.","Scientists from Zurich and Vienna studied almost 40 chimpanzees .

With its rusting interior and basic conditions, it's hard to believe that many of Nazi Germany's most deadly U-boat attacks were partly masterminded here. But this cramped bomb damaged bunker hidden away in the remote German countryside outside Berlin was the hiding place from which top officers in the Kreigsmarine co-ordinated the Battle of the Atlantic in the latter part of World War Two. The site, codenamed Lager Koralle, or Coral Camp, was one of the few spared victorious Soviet forces at the end of the war. And a stern 'Betreten Verboten' sign - 'Keep Out' in English - and rumours that there is still live munitions on the site didn't deter Irish photographer Ciaran Fahey from tracking down the bunker and taking these fascinating pictures. Scroll down for video . Hidden away: Lager Koralle, or Coral Camp, which was the Nazi naval command centre in the latter part of World War Two is tucked away in the remote German countryside . Key base: Most of the overground part of the bunker was destroyed by the Soviets at the end of the war, but much of its sub-surface space remains . Destroyed: The site which was originally built for use as a naval intelligence school . Nerve centre: Photographer Ciaran Fahey describes the bunker as taking on the form of a submarine . Ciaran, who spends his spare time exploring Berlin's abandoned buildings, said: 'The pictures show all that remains of Germanyâs naval headquarters in the latter years of World War Two. 'It was badly damaged as the war was coming to an end, of course, but then the Russians destroyed most of what remained. 'They used the underground bunker and another building as a munitions depot, though, and so these were spared. 'The bunker seems to have taken on the characteristics of a submarine - maybe out of solidarity for the U-boat crews.' Going underground: The eerie remains of the bunker sit around 10 metres below the surface not far from Berlin . Warning signs: Despite signs telling people to stay out of the bunker, Ciaran managed to get inside and take a fascinating set of photos . Secrets of the past: The rusting bunking was the base for U-boat operations in the latter part of the Second World War . Abandoned: Ciaran cannot understand why such interesting remnants of history are now left empty and to rot . Building on the bunker began in 1939 when it was originally intended to be used as a naval intelligence school. But when allied bombs began dropping on Berlin it was deemed a good idea to move naval high command out of the city and into the bunker. The Kriegsmarine was effectively run from Lager Koralle from January 1943, with U-boat operations in the Atlantic controlled under the direction of Karl Donitz. The bunker was damaged in an air raid in April 1945 as the war begun to draw to a close and the Soviets took it over just days later. Time capsule: Remnants of Nazi use of the bunker as well as their Soviet enemies who seized the base at the end of the war are still visible . Original features: Gas and electric pipes that powered the bunker when it was a Nazi military nerve centre still line the walls . Dark: Ciaran recommends taking a torch if you are brave enough to explore the ruins of the bunker . Historic: The bunker was seized by the Soviets days after it suffered severe damage in an air raid . Although they destoryed much of the overground part of the base, they kept part of the underground space and are said to have used it as a weapons store. Nazi U-boats were responsible for destroying more than 2,700 Allied ships during the course of World War Two and historians have previously suggested that Britain was close to losing the war because U-boats were destroying vital goods and food necessary for the war effort. Ciaran said: 'I think most people are also interested in these stories.. 'Itâs crazy to think that buildings of such historical importance are simply abandoned and forgotten. 'I think these places should be preserved for historical reasons so people can learn from mistakes of the past and avoid making them again in future.'

Previous research has highlighted the health benefits of pet ownership. The American Heart Association carried out research which showed that people who have heart problems are more likely to survive if they have the companionship of a pet. It also found that people who own a dog are less likely to develop heart disease. This is thought to be because they tend to walk further and because their pet relieves stress and reduces their chance of obesity. Researchers at the Hospital Research Centre of Brest, in France, discovered that children with autism sometimes develop better social skills if they have a pet to play with. They say autistic children are better able to offer comfort people and to share toys if they have a pet. Other research has suggested that people who own a pet tend to be less lonely, less fearful and more extroverted.","The HenPower project, in Tyne and Wear, has given dozens of elderly people the chance to meet people while looking after their hens .

All parents dream of children who help with the washing up and tidy their bedrooms without being asked. But Lesley Turner, 56, from Bridgend, Wales, admits she has taken her obsession with cleaning too far, unwittingly passing her Obsessive Compulsive Disorder onto daughter Tuesday, 23. The mother and daughter spend every waking hour at home hoovering, dusting, bleaching and steaming every surface. Lesley Turner (r), 56, from Bridgend, Wales, has passed her OCD onto daughter Tuesday, 23 (l) And they are both so frightened of catching germs and of dirt that they don't even kiss or hug. But the pair are determined to get help before it's too late. 'My mum was always very strict when I was little about tidying,' says Tuesday. 'For example, when I brushed my hair, I had to do it in a certain spot in the kitchen and hoover the floor straight afterwards. 'The house has always been very minimal. My bedroom has always been immaculate - no creases on my bed covers, even,' she says. 'I can't even say when I started making my own bed or cleaning. It's just always been normal to me as that's the way I was brought up and I didn't know any different. By the time I went to school, I was dusting and wiping the surfaces and even using bleach in the toilet or in the kitchen. I enjoyed it. I got a real sense of satisfaction at the end of it.' Lesley is trimming the edges of her immaculate lawn with a pair of scissors . Her mother Lesley rarely leaves the house at all and although Tuesday is a student who goes to university every day, studying Public and Emergency Services, the OCD is starting to have an effect on her life, too. 'It is very debilitating,' says Tuesday. 'I absolutely hate going to university. I'm a germaphobe, so I won't touch the university computers or go to the canteen. I sit right on the edge of the seat at the lecture so there's as little contact between me and the dirty seat as possible. 'I don't like to be touched. I don't even like people breathing near me. As for coughing and sneezing - I can't bear it. I go out of my way to avoid contamination. 'I carry anti-bacterial gel and wipes with me so that I don't have to touch door handles or cashpoint machines. 'I want to go travelling after my studies and then get a job, but at the moment there's no way I could do it. The OCD controls me too much. Lesley and Tuesday, both pictured vacuuming their rug, admit to always be cleaning . Tuesday, pictured vacuuming her shelf, hates going to university because of germs . 'My mum and I don't hug or kiss either. I . know people might think that's odd, but we do say, ""I love you"" to each . other so it's just a different way of expressing our feelings.' Whenever Tuesday is at home with her mother they clean. Whether it be steaming floors, bleaching surfaces, or dusting from top to bottom. 'She does feel guilty about it, but I don't blame her,' says Tuesday. 'Her influence on me has been totally unconscious. She did inflict this condition on me, but she didn't realise she was doing it. I do have my own mind, and she didn't make me turn out like this.' The pair star in Channel 4's Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners, where they talk about their condition . and go and clean someone else's house who has the opposite problem to them - hoarding. Lesley cleans up the house of a hoarder. Here she wears a white overall to mow a hoarder's lawn . 'We're both getting help now. The show helped us realise how extreme we have become, and that we need to tackle this. I'm having therapy, and Mum's seeing a psychiatrist. I hope we can both get it under control.' 'I have had OCD all my life, although I have only just been diagnosed officially. I've honestly never thought it was a problem before. It's just the way I am,' says Lesley. 'My mum brought three kids up on her own and the house was always clean. We kept the house nice and made our own beds and dusted our rooms before school, and that was the way until I left home aged 15. 'When I got my own house, I carried on tidying and cleaning every day, and I got worse as I got older.In my 20s I had various jobs, like working in a factory, being a cake decorator, a housekeeper, bar work. I would clean the house before work and when I got home. Tuesday says she wants a job, but she couldn't at the moment due to OCDÂ  (l) Lesley has had OCD all her life (r) 'When I was 33, I had Tuesday as a single parent. She was the shiniest, cleanest baby you ever saw, wiped to within an inch of her life. I changed her nappy far often than it needed. She barely had a chance to get it dirty before I'd put a clean one on. If she was sick, I'd change her outfit straight away and put it straight in the machine. 'Tuesday helps me. I have sciatica and osteoarthritis, so I find it hard to hoover, so Tuesday does that while I do the feather dusting. 'I don't think I'm going to die if I don't turn the lights on and off ten times, I'm not like that. I just get angry and upset, and I can't stop until it's done. I get furious and think, ""How dare that speck of dirt be inside my house after all the dusting I've done?"" 'If I'm lucky, I may get to watch half an hour of TV in the evening. But if I see some dirt while I'm sitting down, I have to get up and start all over again.' 'It's very rare that we allow someone else in the house,' says Lesley. 'We allowed the cameraman in the house but he had to wear bags on his shoes, and not touch anything, and we made him use the pub's toilets instead of our own. But doing the show has made me realise I need to get help. And I do feel for Tuesday. It's not that I encourage her OCD, but I just understand it. I do realise it's totally my fault that she is that way. I feel so guilty, and so sorry for her. I don't want her to be like me and be controlled by this. I want her to go and have fun.

A jury has awarded more than $150 million in damages to a 13-year-old girl who watched her family burn to death in a fiery crash on a Southern California freeway. 'It's hard for her to comprehend' the scope of the verdict reached last week in Los Angeles Superior Court, attorney Brian Brandt said Monday about his young client. The jury found a California trucking company and one of its drivers liable. Kylie Asam was 9 when she and her 11-year-old brother, Blaine, managed to escape from their family's mangled SUV after it struck and got caught under a big rig parked on the shoulder of Interstate 210 nearly four years ago. They saw their parents and older brother get burned alive after the vehicle they were trapped in caught fire. Parents Michael and Shannon Asam, along with 14-year-old son Brennen (centre) were killed during the 2009 early morning crash on Interstate 210 . The Asam family were travelling on the Interstate 210 on November 22, 2009, en route to visit grandparents for Thanksgiving, when they struck the back of a big rig truck unlawfully parked in the shoulder. The driver had ignored signs and pulled over to sleep. He did not have any emergency lights on . The verdict included $8.75 million the jury awarded to Blaine, who committed suicide on his mother's birthday, before the trial began, Brandt said. That money will go to Kylie as her brother's successor-in-interest, but all of the award will be placed in a trust until she is 18, he said. A jury deliberated for about three days before finding Friday that the truck driver, Rudolph Ortiz, was negligent for parking on the side of the freeway in the early morning darkness without leaving on any light or emergency reflector. Ortiz and his employer, Watsonville-based Bhandal Bros. Trucking, were found jointly liable. Asam's wrongful death lawsuit alleged Ortiz pulled over to sleep, ignoring written warnings that stopping there was allowed only in emergencies. The suit said Ortiz parked on the same shoulder Asam's father tried to reach after he struck debris on the freeway and tried to stop. The family from Riverside was headed to Oregon to visit relatives for Thanksgiving when the crash occurred on Nov. 22, 2009. Kylie and her brother Blaine managed to crawl out the window of the family's crumpled SUV - a 2007 GMC Yukon - and escape. Their parents, Michael and Shannon, and her older brother Brennen, 15, burnt to death in te wreck . 05 Jan 2006, Detroit, Michigan, USA --- 2007 GMC Yukon XL Denali --- Image by Â© Car Culture/Corbis . During the trial, defense attorneys countered that Ortiz stopped to take medication for a severe headache, which constituted an emergency. Attorney Raymond McElfish also contended the truck driver broke no law because he was parked on the dirt to the right of the shoulder. Although California Highway Patrol officers found no debris on the road, Brandt said a dent in the rim of one of the SUV's tires was proof that the SUV hit something. He said the children flagged down a driver who used a fire extinguisher and shoveled dirt to try to put out the growing fire. The driver said Ortiz came out of the truck after a second 911 call was made to authorities. The jury agreed that Asam's father also was negligent, but determined his actions were not a substantial factor in causing his family's deaths. Kylie Asam now lives with her aunt and uncle in Orange County.","Car crash in 2009 claimed the lives of Kylie Asam's parents and older brother in Southern California .

Warning: Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, said courts face 'enormous challenges' in today's society . Courts should not give Christianity more weight than other religions, a senior judge has said. Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, said Britain was a âmulticultural community of many faithsâ and that judges must take an âessentially neutral view of religious beliefsâ and not âweigh one religion against anotherâ. In a speech in London, he said judges âhappilyâ no longer had a role in enforcing morality, unlike in the past when theyÂ  routinely condemned homosexuality, adultery and promoted Victorian social attitudes. âOnce upon a time, the perceived function of the judges was to promote virtue and discourage vice and immorality,â he said. âI doubt one would now hear that from the judicial bench. âToday, surely, the judicial task is to assess matters by the standards of reasonable men and women in 2013 â not by the standards of their parents in 1970.â Sir James said that Victorian judges promoted âvirtue and moralityâ whileÂ  discouraging âvice and immoralityâ with a âvery narrow view of sexual moralityâ. He cited laws banning gay sex and abortion and rulings that condemned women for adultery. He added that the influence of Christian churches in the courts had also disappeared in recent years. He said: âHappily for us, the days areÂ  past when the business of judges wasÂ  the enforcement of morals or religious beliefs.â He said that modern-day judges had rightly abandoned any claim to be âguardians of public moralityâ, just as Christian clerics no longer claimed to speak as the âdefining voices of morality and of the law of marriage and the familyâ. Sir James said the last few years had seen the âdisappearance, in an increasingly secular and pluralistic society, of what until comparatively recently was in large measure a commonly accepted package of moral, ethical and religious valuesâ. âToday, we live in a largely secular society which, insofar as it remains religious at all, is now increasingly diverse in religious affiliation,â he said. âAlthough, historically, this country is part of the Christian West and although it has an established church which is Christian, we sit as secular judges serving a multi-cultural community of many faiths, sworn to do justice âto all manner of peopleâ. Controversy: Former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams sparked a religious row in 2008 over his comments about Sharia law . âWe live in this country in a democratic and pluralistic society, in a secular state not a theocracy,â Sir James said in a keynote address to the first annual conference of the Law Societyâs family law section in London on Tuesday. In his speech, called âLaw, Morality and Religion in the Family Courtsâ, he said courts no longer recognised any religious distinctions and âgenerally, passed no judgment on religious beliefs or on the tenets, doctrines or rules of any particular section of societyâ. âAll are entitled to respect, so long as they are âlegally and socially acceptableâ and not âimmoral or socially obnoxiousâ or âperniciousâ,â he said. However, Sir James did point to elements of religious practice which he said were âbeyond the paleâ, including forced marriage, female genital mutilation and so-called âhonour-basedâ domestic violence. He also said courts would overrule parentsâ religious beliefs if it was in their childâs best interests, such as if a child of Jehovahâs Witnesses needed a blood transfusion. âWe live in a largely secular society which, insofar as it remains religious at all, is now increasingly diverse in religious affiliation,â he added. He said a believerâs faith was not the âbusiness of government or of the secular courtsâ, âalthough, of course, the courts will pay every respect to the individualâs or familyâs religious principles'.","Sir James Munby: Judges shouldn't 'weigh one religion against another'

Turkey is for the first time connecting its European and Asian sides with a railway tunnel, which is set to open today. The sub-sea passage that runs below the Bosphorus Strait, will link the Asian and European shores of Istanbul for the first time. The opening of the major engineering project marks the completion of a plan initially proposed by an Ottoman sultan about 150 years ago. An illustration of how an underground railway route linking Istanbul's European side with it's Asian side was created. After eight years of construction, Turkey has opened the first rail tunnel under the Bosphorus Strait . The sub-sea passage that opens today, runs below the Bosphorus Strait (centre) and will link the Asian and European shores of Istanbul for the first time . It is intended to ease traffic congestion and pollution in Istanbul as well as creating an important trading route, which connects China and Western Europe. The tunnel is among a number of large infrastructure projects under the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan that have helped boost the economy but also have provoked a backlash of public protest. The tunnel is 13.6 kilometres (8.5 miles) long, with 1.4 kilometres (4,593 feet) running under the Bosphorus - the strait that connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and divides Istanbul between Asia and Europe. The tunnel is among a number of large infrastructure projects under the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan (third on the right). He is joined on the train by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (right) the President of Somalia, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud (second right) andTurkey's President Abdullah Gul (seated) as they ride the ceremonial service . Turkish officials say that at more than 55 metres deep, it will be the deepest submerged railway tunnel of its type in the world. Officials hope that with a 1.5 million passengers a day, it will ease some of Istanbul's terrible traffic, particularly over the two bridges that currently connect the two sides of the city. The project started in 2005 and was scheduled to be completed in four years, but was delayed by important archaeological finds, including a 4th century Byzantine port, as builders began digging under the city. The tunnel has raised fears that it could be vulnerable to earthquakes in a region of high seismic activity. But Turkish Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim said that it is designed to withstand a massive 9.0 magnitude quake. He calls it 'the safest place in Istanbul.' Ottoman Sultan Abdulmejid is said to have first proposed the idea of a tunnel under the Bosphorus about a century and a half ago and one of his successors, Abdulhamid, had architects submit proposals in 1891, but the plans were not carried out. A view of Istanbul old town looking towards the Bosphorus. The new tunnel is intended to ease traffic congestion and pollution in the city as well as connecting its European and Asian shores . The tunnel is just one of Prime Minister Erdogan's large-scale plans. Others include a separate tunnel being built under the Bosphorus for cars, a third bridge over the strait, the world's biggest airport and a massive canal that would bypass the Bosphorus. The projects have provoked accusations that the government is going ahead with city-changing plans without sufficient public consultation and the concern fueled protests that swept Turkey in June. Today's ceremony at 1pm GMT falls on the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. It will be attended by Prime Minister Erdogan and other officials including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose country was heavily involved in the construction and financing of the railway tunnel project.","Turkey's sub-sea tunnel will open today at 1pm GMT and at 55 metres deep, will be the deepest submerged railway tunnel of its type in the world .

A testy face-off between a 'Google employee' and a protester has now been revealed as a set up as the man who barked at the protester was a member of the same activist group. A local paper uploaded a video of a man getting off one of the private shuttle buses used by Google to transport employees from San Francisco to the company's headquarters about an hour's drive away. On Monday, a group of demonstrators stopped the bus, chanting that the company was one of the reasons why so many lower-income residents are being forced out of their homes in search of cheaper rent. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Looking for a fight: A man initially identified- incorrectly- as a Google employee got into a screaming match with a protestor and he told her to move somewhere else if she couldn't afford rent in San Francisco . The man, later identified as Max Bell Alper, gets off the bus and gets into a screaming match with one of the protestors, saying: 'Well then why don't you go to a city where you can afford it because this is a city for the right people who can afford it.' 'If you can't afford it, it's time for you to leave,' he continued. 'If you can't pay your rent, I'm sorry. Get a better job.' The man's true identity, after only identifying himself at the scene as a Google employee, was revealed later on Monday as a union organizer by the San Francisco Bay Guardian. 'This is political theater to demonstrate what is happening to the city. It's about more than just the bus,' Alper told The San Francisco Bay Guardian after the jig was up. Even though the protestor that Alper yelled at in the incident appears to be smiling- almost hinting that she may have been in on the joke- has said that she didn't know it was about to happen. She said she didn't even know who Alper was. Out of the loop: Even when the 'employee' was identified as union activist Max Bell Alper, the protestor remained committed to the fact that she, Erin McElroy, had no idea who he was or that it was a set-up . 'No I did not know him, he didn't tell me that he was going to be doing that,' said Erin McElroy, who heads the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project. Alper's group is fighting against the increasing inequality divide in the city which is forcing many out to the suburbs where rents are more reasonable. 'I'm really upset that this happened. We've calculated about 11,000 no fault evictions since 1997,' Alper said. 'These are enormous corporations that are investing in this community. These companies, like Google, should be proud of where they're from and invest in their communities.'

Someone really ought to give these birds a heads up about their appearance if they're ever going to find a mate. The bizarre photograph appears to show two king penguins decapitated on the British overseas territory of South Georgia, in the South Atlantic. In fact the shot is a trick of the lens as photographer Charles Kinsey, 64, reveals the birds thankfully just have their heads turned behind their backs preening themselves. He's off his head! The bizarre photograph appears to show two king penguins decapitated on the British overseas territory of South Georgia, in the South Atlantic . Charles, from Bristol, took the picture during a trip to the remote island chain 2,500 miles from Antarctica. Charles, a retired science teacher, . said: 'I do a lot of travelling - almost always to see wildlife - partly . because I enjoy it enormously but partly because I can find out about . conservation issues at first hand and take relevant photographs for . talks which I do on conservation. 'I . was with a group from the travel company Exodus - it was a photographic . charter using the Russian research ship Vavilov and we spent about four . days around South Georgia before going on to Antarctica. I had never . been to either place before. 'I was walking around on the beach at Fortuna Bay - watching all the comings and goings of the penguins and fur seals. Here's how they should look: The King Penguin is the second largest species of penguin, weighing between 11kg and 16kg . The King Penguin is the second . largest species of penguin in the world, second only to the Emperor Penguin. Mainly found in the South Atlantic . and the northernmost waters of the northern Antarctic, there are . believed to be around 2.23million King Penguins and their numbers are . increasing. From early spring, which falls in . November, hundreds of thousands of King penguins descend on the beaches of the South Atlantic to breed. Known for being able to dive to extreme depths of more than 330Â ft, they feed mostly on small fish and squid. They are also serially monogamous, remaining with one partner for an entire breeding cycle. King penguins make extraordinary parents. While one parent is guarding the chick, the other makes a trip of up to 250 miles in search of food. When the young are old enough, they are left with other juveniles so both parents can search for food. The adults return to the sea during the winter, leaving the chicks to survive on their own until they return. 'This was our first landing on the island of South Georgia and my head was spinning with everything that was going on. 'I did not really know which way to look or what to photograph. At one point, I just happened to be standing very close to the Exodus professional photographer Paul Goldstein when he spotted the two king penguins, about 15 metres away, with their heads behind their backs - almost certainly preening their back feathers. 'Paul alerted me by just pointing at them and saying 'Charles, take that now' They were only like that for a few seconds so I only had the chance of one shot. 'At the time, I realised that it was a great photographic opportunity as the pair were well positioned on a ridge of shingle on the beach with nothing to distract in the background . 'There are more King Penguins on South Georgia than anywhere else in the world. Later on we went to St Andrew's Bay where there were just thousands and thousands.' Charles used a Canon 450D SLR with a 28-300 zoom lens to get the amazing picture. He said: 'The extraordinary thing is that I see penguins every day when I am home as my flat in Clifton directly overlooks the penguin enclosure at Bristol Zoo. 'I get a very good view of them from my kitchen window when I am washing up. The Bristol Zoo penguins are all African penguins. They used to have a few kings but now specialise in the African ones.'","The photograph was taken by Charles Kinsey on the isle of South Georgia .

Disgraced former San Diego mayor Bob Filner was sentenced Monday to three months of home confinement and three years of probation for harassing women while in office . The decision completed the fall of the former 10-term congressman who barely a year ago achieved his long dream of being elected leader of the nation's eighth-largest city. Filner, who resigned amid widespread allegations of sexual harassment, pleaded guilty in October to one felony and two misdemeanors for placing a woman in a headlock, kissing another woman and grabbing the buttocks of a third. Scroll down for video... Say cheese: Filner, here smiling at his defense team at his Monday sentencing, pleaded not guilty to harassment charges after a drawn out public humiliation saw the former congressman accused by nearly 20 women. Now he'll walk away without serving any jail time . Superior Court Judge Robert Trentacosta's sentence was the same as what prosecutors recommended in a plea agreement with Filner. The 71-year-old former mayor faced a maximum penalty of three years in prison for the felony and one year in jail for each misdemeanor. The judge specified the Filner may not seek or hold elective office during the term of his probation. 'I want to apologize to my family who have stood by me through this ordeal, to my loyal staff and supporters, to the citizens of San Diego and, most sincerely, to the women who I have hurt and offended,' he said, according to UT San Diego. He continued: 'To all of you I make the . same promise that I made to my family, to earn back your trust and my . integrity no matter how long it takes and what I have to do.' Still smiling? Irene McCormack Jackson and attorney Gloria Allred walk to attend Filner's sentencing. Jackson, 57, the one-time communications director for Filner . Accusers: They included the first to publicly point the finger at Filner, Irene McCormack Jackson (center); Michelle Tyler, a nurse who claims Filner made inappropriate advances on her while she was seeking help for a disabled Marine (left) and great-grandmother Peggy Shannon (right) Sentenced: Filner, here at his sentencing, must serve 90 days home confinement, three years probation, and undergo mental health treatment . He also claimed to have become a changed man since the harassment incidents: . 'The letters submitted to this court by my family show the progress that they have already seen, . 'Certainly the behaviors before this court today will never be repeated. And I am confident that I will come out of this a better person and I look forward to making further contributions to the city I love.' Filner, who is divorced, was convicted of felony false imprisonment for restraining a woman against her will at a fund-raiser on March 6 and applying additional force when she resisted. His attorney, Jerry Coughlan, has said it was a headlock. The misdemeanor counts of battery . were for kissing a woman on the lips without permission at a âMeet the . Mayorâ event on April 6 and grabbing another woman's buttocks at a May . 25 rally to clean up Fiesta Island in Mission Bay. None of the victims . have been identified. Nearly . 20 women have publicly identified themselves as targets of Filner's . unwanted advances, including kissing, groping and requests for dates. His accusers include a retired Navy rear admiral, a San Diego State . University dean and a great-grandmother who volunteers answering senior . citizens' questions at City Hall. The . charges do not involve Filner's former communications director, Irene . McCormack Jackson, who expedited the mayor's downfall by becoming the . first to go public with sexual harassment allegations in July. She has . filed a lawsuit against Filner and the city, claiming her boss asked her . to work without panties, demanded kisses, told her he wanted to see her . naked and dragged her in a headlock while whispering in her ear. Another victim: Bronwyn Ingram, former fiance of San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, broke things off after three years with Filner days before news of his scandal broke . Filner . disappeared from public view after leaving office Aug. 30, less than . nine months into a four-year term. He said little when he resurfaced six . weeks later to plead guilty in San Diego Superior Court, but his . attorney told reporters then that the former mayor âprofusely . apologizesâ for his behavior. The former mayor devoted himself to jogging, getting therapy and talking to friends after leaving office, his attorney said in October. Television news crews hoping for a glimpse of Filner were disappointed when he showed up at jail a day earlier than expected for booking. Filner was elected San Diego's first Democratic mayor in 20 years, promising to put neglected neighborhoods ahead of entrenched downtown business interests. Two city councilmen seeking to replace him in a special election runoff â Republican Kevin Faulconer and Democrat David Alvarez â have embraced Filner's neighborhoods-first mantra while scarcely mentioning the former mayor by name. Kept coming: Local businesswoman Dianne York became the 18th woman to come forward with accusations against Filner when she spoke at this news conference in August . Range of claims: Charges against Filner ranged from false imprisonment to groping. Great-grandmother Peggy Shannon repeatedly asked her to rub his hands, requested dates and made sexually suggestive comments . 'Freedom from Filner': Filner's public flogging was a conspicuous end to what had been a long political career. The 10-term congressman had a long-held dream of running San Diego, but the dream turned bitter after only about a year .","Bob Filner was disgraced after nearly 20 women came forward to accuse him of unwanted advances, including kissing, groping and asking for dates .

Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that disturbs cell growth in the nervous system, causing tumors to form on tissues. The tumors are usually benign, but in some cases they become cancerous. People with neurofibromatosis often experience only mild symptoms including light brown spots or soft bumps on the skin, freckling in the armpits or groin area, bone deformities, learning disabilities and a larger than average head size. Effects can range from hearing loss, learning impairment and cardiovascular complications to severe disability due to nerve compression by tumors, loss of vision and severe pain. Neurofibromatosis treatment aims to maximize healthy growth and development and to manage complications as soon as they arise. When the condition causes large tumors that press on a nerve, surgery may help ease symptoms. Some people may benefit from other therapies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery, medications to control pain or physical therapy. 'Hold your head up high knowing that you have friends all over the world! You are very loved. God bless you.' They also praised Mrs Sejas for coming up with initiative. 'What a wonderful gift you are giving to your baby girl,' they wrote. Mrs Sejas now plans to decorate the Christmas tree with all of the cards that have been sent to Gabbie.

This little fellow looks as if he is stopping to check the time on a diver's watch as he scurries about his business on the ocean floor . These amazing images, taken by a marine photographer, shed light on the fascinating world of rarely seen seahorses . In the series - which was taken over a period of four years on the island of Maui, Hawaii - the incredible creatures are seen gazing at their own reflection in the diver's watch . They show the incredible relationship that developed between the seahorses and underwater photographer, Don McLeish. The mysterious equine-like fish are famous for being impossible to find. However Mr McLeish, 62, struck gold one day in September, 2009. 'I was told by a long-time diving friend, who has lived on the island of Maui for many years, that I would likely never see one. 'But one day another friend told me he had seen a seahorse whilst taking a group diving and asked me if I wanted to join him in looking for it.' Little did he know how that day would mark the start of an astonishing adventure, in which he would build a connection with a group of seahorses that experts have classed as 'unique'. The incredible creatures are even seen holding the hands of divers with their bony tails . The mysterious equine-like fish are famous for being incredibly hard to find . Lucy and Ricky the seahorses, next to Don McLeish's hand off the coast of Hawaii . 'To have these animals so close and available was apparently very uncommon. I began visiting them frequently and taking photos,' said Don. Mr McLeish and the marine life watching community of the mid-Pacific island, quickly realised that two of these seahorses were a pair of mates. They named the duo Lucy and Ricky. Not long afterwards Mr McLeish took the endearing picture of the seahorse gazing into his diver's watch. He said: 'Is it looking at its reflection? Is it looking at the watch? I don't know what it was looking at.' The minute beasts took up home in a 'pasture' where conditions were ideal for them to live in. The pasture is a small area of shallow reef and although similar algae and seafloor conditions are nearby, no other seahorses can be found. Unlike any other species, male seahorses become pregnant. Don said: 'We first noticed Ricky was carrying eggs in December, 2011, and appeared to be constantly pregnant for the rest of his life. 'Some females can keep three or four males pregnant on an ongoing basis. I have no reason to suspect Lucy had another male besides Ricky but then she was gone to parts unknown at times.' Over the next couple of years, a strong family unit grew and attracted hundreds of visitors who wanted to catch a glimpse of the wondrous beasts. However tragedy struck when Ricky was found with part of his insides hanging out on the one side of his pouch in March this year. 'It is my strong suspicion that someone might have stepped on him as the pasture was close to two big holiday resorts.' Ricky the seahorse, is seen here pregnant. Seahorses are the only species where the male can carry eggs . Mr McLeish and the marine life watching community of the mid-Pacific island, quickly realised that two of these seahorses were a pair of mates. They named the duo Lucy and Ricky . Don McLeish, 62, seen here in a diving mask behind a bright yellow seahorse, said: 'To have these animals so close and available was apparently very uncommon' Often seahorses will die shortly after a partner passes away as this particular breed has life-long monogamous relationships. But Lucy continued on in the pasture, and in August a new small male arrived who appeared to be courting her. However the relationship didn't long as in November this year a wicked storm arrived on Maui's shores and when Mr McLeish returned, Lucy was nowhere to be found. 'Had I known that it would have been the last day I would see her, I would have taken more images and spent more time with her. 'Heck, I would have cried watching her knowing that it was goodbye. At the time, I just thought it was another day. 'I can only hope that they have moved on to a better place.' Musing on his extensive contact with Lucy and Ricky, Mr McLeish believes that it is their nature to be resigned to whatever comes in contact with them. 'They are terrible swimmers and their only defence is not being seen and holding onto things. 'I do believe they can sense the nature of any threat as well as becoming accustomed to human interactions based on experience. 'I try to keep contact to a minimum but a hand is useful to give the seahorses some scale.' Don claims that more often than not, the seahorse will respond to his hand by wrapping its tail around his finger and often won't let go.'","Pictures taken over a period of four years on the island of Maui, Hawai .

The Digital Revolution exhibition has been designed as a 'celebration of digital creativity.' All the models are in working condition and will be available to play as part of the exhibition, which tracks their respective places in technological history. Other examples include Manic Miner on the ZX Spectrum and the first website to be created by pioneer Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.

This includes Tetris, pictured, first released in June 1984 for consoles and arcades. It became popular in 1989 when it was made available on the handheld Nintendo Game Boy . The aim of the game is to stack the different shaped Tetriminos together to complete rows, these completed rows then disappear. Once the rows reach the top of the screen, the game ends. It was voted the 'Greatest Game of All Time' by Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine and a digital version is now sold for phones and tablets. Pong is a 2D arcade table tennis game. Paddle's are moved along the sides of the screen to hit a moving 'ball' back and forth. The player who scores the most points wins. It was the first game to be designed by computer maker Atari in 1972 and was originally created as a programming training exercise. Space Invaders is an arcade video game created by Tomohiro Nishikado in 1978. It is a 2D 'fixed shooter game' and the aim is to shoot aliens using a laser on a cannon at the bottom of the screen. Also on display in the Digital Revolution exhibition is the the Roger Linn LM-1 drum machine, pictured. The first song featuring an LM-1 to reach number one in UK charts was the Human League's 'Don't You Want Me', in 1981. It has also been used in by Peter Gabriel, Fleetwood Mac, and Stevie Wonder . The cannon can be moved from left to right and the game ends if the rows of aliens reach the bottom of the screen. Pac-Man, developed by Namco, was initially released in Japan in 1980. A player moves Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots. When all dots, or pellets, are eaten, the player advances to the next stage. Ghosts chase Pac-Man around the screen and if the player hits an enemy, they lose a life. Google created a playable Pac-Man doodle in February last year that let people play an online version of the game in their browser.

Nestled in a wooded valley which is home to rabbits, deer and even a holy well, Whichford seems the ideal location for a holistic retreat. But the peace and quiet of the sleepy Cotswolds village has been shattered by a war of words between a band of well-heeled residents â led by a millionaire author â and the couple behind the âalternative campsiteâ and adjoining âhouse of healingâ. Andy Birtwell, 67, and his wife Sally, 63, opened Holycombe Spiritual Development Centre on the edge of the south Warwickshire community a decade ago. Objection: Andy and Sally Birtwell deny their Holycombe Spritual Development Centre hosts rowdy raves and drunken revellers . Claims: Site owners Andy Birtwell, and his wife Sally say Holycombe Spiritual Development Centre attracts people looking for a quiet setting . The centre, which boasts its own stone . circle, plays host to yoga teachers, Pilates instructors, meditation . groups and song and dance sessions. But their closest neighbour, . author Terry Maher, 73, who wrote a best-selling memoir, Against My . Better Judgement, and novel Unfinished Business, is taking legal action . against the couple after they were granted retrospective planning . permission for the 30-pitch campsite earlier this month. Some of the . villageâs 320 residents are even threatening to boycott donations to the . local 12th century church, St Michaelâs, after Mr Birtwell suggested . his centre enjoyed a âsymbiotic relationshipâ with the church. Mr . Maher, whose Â£1million home lies 400 yards from the campsite, is . attempting to get a judicial review to overturn the councilâs decision. The . former chairman of defunct bookseller Dillons has lived in the village . with wife Barbara for 30 years. He said: âI have been friends with Andy . and Sally for many, many years and I even persuaded him to buy the land. âEverything . was fine, and we had no opposition to the holistic centre but the . campsite is causing noise which is very intrusive to us. Complaints: Author and publisher Terry Maher, pictured, claims his tranquility is being ruined by the neighbouring holistic peace retreat .

She added: âOne of the worst things is that people come into the village and park all over the place. âIt got particularly bad in 2011 which was what prompted us allÂ  to complain.â The . retreat is situated where a Norman castle once stood, although now . only a shallow moat remains. Idyllic: Holycombe Spiritual Development Centre has been run from this site in the Cotswold village of Whichford by Andy Birtwell, 67, and his wife Sally, 63, for the past 10 years . Tranquil: Holycombe Spiritual Development Centre is set in the middle of picturesque countryside . Mr Birtwell said initially, only a handful . of people camped each year â within rules which allowed camping on the . site for less than 28 days a year without planning permission. But . the popularity of the site took off in 2011 after it was featured in a . national newspaper article on âcool campsitesâ and neighbours began to . complain about noise caused by groups of guests drinking late into the . night and playing loud music. The Birtwells said they rebranded the . site as a âquietâ destination, where radios and instruments of any kind . were banned â except, of course, the acoustic guitar. The couple, who . have six children, also introduced a policy only to admit singles, . couples or families â barring large groups.

Mr Birtwell, who runs a water purifying company, said: âWe took . full responsibility for the noisy guests we hadÂ  in 2011.

It might not seem very statesmanlike but at least it is festive. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg revealed his official Christmas card today, complete with him in a Santa hat and wife Miriam sporting reindeer ears and Rudolph's red nose. The humorous image is the work of their sons, and is a marked departure from the carefully stage-managed portraits chosen by the other political leaders. Joke: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg allowed his sons to use an iPad to doctor this photograph of him and wife Miriam . David Cameron and Ed Miliband have both opted for more serious photographs with their wives and children, designed to present themselves as relaxed family men. In the past Mr Clegg has opted for traditional drawings or paintings by his children, but this year Antonio, Miguel and Alberto have used a photograph of mum and dad as a starting point for their masterpiece. The picture was taken at the family home in South West London by photographer James Gourley. The Clegg boys then used an iPad to add the Christmas tree and transform their parents into Santa and Rudolph. Mr Clegg has consistently refused to place his children in the media spotlight in the same way as other political leaders. By contrast Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday released his smart-casual Christmas card, featuring his wife and sons in a pose which would not look out of place in a mail order catalogue. Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife Justine take their children Daniel (left) and Sam (right) for a walk along Brighton beach, in a photograph chosen for his official Christmas card . The Miliband family portrait shows Mr Miliband and wife Justine with their sons Daniel and Samuel. It was taken during a walk along Brighton beach at the start of the Labour Party conference earlier this year as the family headed out to a play park before the heavy political agenda got under way. In smart trousers and a grey pullover, Mr Miliband appears to be straining to look relaxed. When the pictures were taken in September it was noted that they were markedly different to Gordon Brownâs refusal to be photographed with his own young children. But Labour strategists made clear that they wanted to give Mrs Miliband a more high profile role in a bid to give her husband a popularity boost. The release of the Labour leader's card comes after Number 10 revealed David Cameronâs three-year-old daughter Florence has been given a starring role in the Prime Ministerâs official Christmas card - for the second time. Greeting: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha photographed with daughter Florence at 10 Downing Street for their 2013 Christmas card . The striking black and white portrait features Mr Cameron and wife Samantha hugging their daughter inside Number 10 in October. The card will be sent around the globe to world leaders and dignitaries, as well as to senior figures in the UK. Captured . by award-winning photographer Tom Stoddart, the picture shows the . Cameronsâ youngest child gripping her fatherâs neck while she snuggles . against her mother. - UKIP leader Nigel Farage . It . is striking that the three-year-old features so prominently because . David Cameron has closely guarded his childrenâs privacy since moving to . Number 10 and usually requests that all photographs of them are . pixelated. Mr Cameron has opted for a photograph of . himself and wife Samantha each year since taking power in 2010, when . they chose the photograph of the couple holding baby Florence on the . steps of Number 10. The outspoken MEP Godfrey Bloom does not take himself so seriously. After . a year in which he has grabbed the headlines for outspoken comments . about aid to âBongo Bongo Landâ and women being âslutsâ for not doing . the cleaning properly, the 64-year-old and his wife have posed for a . self-mocking Christmas card. Godfrey Bloom holds bongos in their Christmas card and wife Katie does her best 'slut' impression . The MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, . who quit the UK Independence Party in September to sit as an . independent, clutches bongos given to him by a music shop while his wife . Katie is dressed as a âslutâ. The . photo, taken in the kitchen of the coupleâs house in a village near . Goole, East Yorkshire, will be on cards posted to friends and family. But his old boss, UKIP leader Nigel Farage, takes a very different view about the trend for political leaders to feature in their own cards. 'Rest assured, any cards sent from family Farage will be suitably festive rather than have my face on it,' he said. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond revealed his official Christmas card last week, an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who . turned up too late to see Jesus. He opted for the bleak, sinewy painting of Artaban by Scottish artist Peter Howson. Festive? This painting of the fourth wise man Artaban by Peter Howson will grace the front of the First Minister Alex Salmond's 2013 charity Christmas card . The . artwork will be sold to raise money for charity, but some questioned . whether its choice for a Christmas card was not very festive. Since 2007 Mr Salmond . has raised Â£148,000 for charities in Scotland through sales of the . original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card. Today . he unveiled the Howson painting, which will be sold at auction in the . New Year with the proceeds shared between the Children's Hospice . Association Scotland (Chas), CLIC Sargent, Scottish Catholic . International Aid Fund (Sciaf) and Combat Stress, the charity chosen by . the artist. He insisted the image of Artaban is a âhugely appropriateâ work for his card. Mr Salmond said: âThe legend of . Artaban, or the fourth wise man, is based on a novel by Henry van Dyke. It tells the tale of a Persian scholar who, delayed by helping the . vulnerable, follows the star to Bethlehem but arrives just too late to . herald the birth of the Christ child. âThirty years on in Jerusalem, at Passover, Artaban is still searching. âNow . an old man, he parts with the last of his three gifts to Jesus, a . sapphire, a ruby and a pearl, to save a young girl from slavery.

Gateway: The island of Malta in the Mediterranean could be used by the super-rich to gain access to the European Union . Malta, which joined the EU in 2004, will offer the citizenship and passport from next month. Up to 300 âhigh valueâ people are expected to take advantage of the scheme, each paying â¬650,000 (Â£546,000). Opposition parties in Malta have raised concerns about the vetting process and the fact the identities of those who buy a passport will be kept secret. Many countries have schemes speeding up the citizenship process for wealthy investors. Rich foreign investors will be able to effectively buy a Maltese passport . But Malta will give applicants a passport without requiring them to live in the country first. The Home Office said: âThe Government is clear that EU citizens who benefit from the right to free movement must adhere to the responsibilities this brings with it. âThe Government does not tolerate the abuse of free movement rights and is working at a domestic level and with other member states to tackle such abuse.â However, the UK government is facing calls to intervene to stop the scheme going ahead. Labourâs . shadow immigration minister David Hanson told the Financial Times: . âThis risks being a backdoor route to reside anywhere in the EU which is . not a tight or appropriate immigration policyâ. The UK offers an âinvestor visaâ to non-EU citizens with more than Â£1million in personal wealth to invest in Britain. However they must spend at least 185 days in the UK each year. There are warnings the appeal of investing in the UK will be undermined if the super-rich flock to Malta instead. The .

Access: Buying Maltese citizenship will allow someone to live or work anywhere in the EU . The European Commission is refusing to get embroiled in the row, insisting it is a matter of ânational competencyâ how individual countries administer their visa policies. A spokesman said: 'The EU has no legal power to intervene. It in effect only has powers that are delegated to it by the Member States, who have - and (presumably this would include the UK) want to keep - full sovereignty over to whom they grant their nationality.

He was concerned after noticing she was suffering from severe pain in her side. Cheryl Wray, 22, was diagnosed with a tumour on her pancreas after Stephen Kittles insisted that she went to see a doctor about a pain in her side . Miss Wray, of White Notley, Essex, said: . âI thought the pain was due to muscle strain. I was working at a . supermarket and was doing a fair amount of heavy lifting at the time. âMe and Stephen were in a car together when I put the seat back and involuntarily yelped out in pain. âHe became very concerned and asked what was wrong. I told him it was probably nothing but he said, âno, you have to go to see a doctorâ. âI didn't want to be thought of as a hypochondriac so was ready to brush it aside, but Stephen being so insistent made me change my mind and I booked an appointment.â Miss Wray visited her GP in January 2009 and was sent for an urgent ultrasound scan. She said: âAt first we thought it was kidney stones. Stephen came with me to the scan for support. âThe doctor phoned me with the results before I went to work. I knew straight away that something serious was going on - the doctor doesn't usually call you directly.â Ms Wray was not intending to see a doctor about the pain as she thought it was caused by a strained muscle she had suffered while working in a supermarket . Ms Wray (pictured with her father, Patrick, in hospital) had to have surgery to remove the precancerous tumour . The ultrasound revealed an alarming growth suggesting a cancerous or pre-cancerous tumour on her pancreas. It is rare for teenagers to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which is often fatal. A month after the growth was revealed, Miss Wray and Mr Kittles, 27, became engaged during a visit to Clacton-on-Sea. She said: âI asked him to marry me on the beach by writing the words in the sand. He wrote âyesâ and then took me to the end of the pier, where he got down on one knee and asked me back. âWhen we met, it took just two hours for me to realise I wanted to be with him. We both love Bon Jovi - especially the songs âAlwaysâ and âThank You for Loving Meâ, which has become our song.â Ms Wray no longer has any signs of the tumour in her body but she still has to go for check ups every year . Ms Wray spent a month in hospital recovering from her operation. Picture shows her 18-inch scar . After several nervous months of further tests, Ms Wray underwent surgery just days after her 18th birthday in July 2009. She said: âI signed all the consent forms in a state of disbelief and shock. It was difficult to understand what was happening to me. They removed the growth, but were sufficiently worried to remove my spleen too.â Miraculously, the growth was judged to be precancerous and there were no signs of the cancer spreading to any other part of her body. The realisation of how precarious her position had been only dawned on her as she lay in hospital for a month recovering from the operation. Ms Wray said: 'I signed all the consent forms in a state of disbelief and shock. It was difficult to understand what was happening to me. They removed the growth, but were sufficiently worried to remove my spleen too' She said: âIt suddenly dawned on me how serious things were. The tumour had grown really quickly and had I left it any longer the surgeons probably wouldn't have been able to do anything about it. âI was shocked and broke down in tears, but Stephen did a really good job looking after me.â Mr Kittles, who works at a bowling alley . in Braintree, said: âLooking back I'm so glad I was so insistent that . Cheryl went to the doctor. Even though we'd only just met, I was very . worried about her. Pancreatic cancer is notoriously hard to diagnose as it rarely causes symptoms in the early stages. Symptoms do not tend to develop until the cancer is advanced. The first symptoms can include pain in the upper abdomen, unexpected weight loss and loss of appetite, jaundice, diabetes, nausea and vomiting. Source: NHS Choices . âIt was very difficult to see Cheryl suffering through the diagnosis and the surgery, but I stayed supportive, and I always will be supportive.â Ms Wray, who now requires annual cancer scans, said she is looking forward to enjoying a happy, healthy life with her fiancÃ©. She said: âWe're trying to have children and I'm on medication to help us along with that. We'll get married as soon as we can, but we don't know when that will be yet.â Miss Wray now offers support to sufferers of pancreatic cancer on Facebook, giving encouragement and advice through her group entitled ""Pancreatic Cancer-help"".

The Government will today confirm long-awaited compensation for villages blighted by fracking as it paves the way for millions of acres to be explored, it has been reported. Ministers are firmly behind shale gas drilling, with energy minister Michael Fallon attacking 'myths' about its safety and the chancellor, George Osborne, halving the tax on firms' profits. Today they will confirm a promise that villagers will get Â£100,000 and one per cent of revenue from every fracking well, the Daily Telegraph reported. Controversial: The government is pressing ahead with plans to explore shale gas drilling known as 'fracking', despite 1,000 activists descending on a test site earlier this year in Balcombe, East Sussex (pictured) The process involves pumping water, chemicals and sand into shale rock at high pressure until it cracks . The move is an apparent attempt to boost public support for fracking just days before firms are given a new wave of provisional licences to drill. Ministers are preparing to identify huge areas that should be explored, the Telegraph added. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand into shale rock at high pressure to blast it open and release gas which is trapped inside. Campaigners warn it is catastrophic for the environment, including causing earth tremors and contaminating the water supply. One site in Lancashire was suspended briefly last year after the test drilling caused small earthquakes. Anger: Police remove a protester from the fracking test site in Balcombe, West Sussex, earlier this year . But the government supports exploring . the divisive technique, saying it will boost the country's energy . supplies at a time of uncertainty. A statement in August said 'government policy seeks to increase security of supply', adding there was a 'continuing role for gas in the energy mix and support for shale gas exploration'. Tax cuts: George Osborne promised new incentives for fracking firms in his Autumn statement . The process is only at a test phase in Britain, but has already come under intense scrutiny. More than 1,000 activists set up camp earlier this year in Balcombe, East Sussex, in a bid to stop the firm Cuadrilla from drilling a test well. Backbench Conservatives are also worried that their rural constituencies will turn on them if the government swings too far in favour of fracking. But during last week's Autumn statement, George Osborne said: 'The country that was the first to extract oil and gas from deep under the sea should not turn its back on new sources of energy like shale gas because itâs all too difficult. '[There will be] a new tax allowance to encourage investment in shale gas that halves tax rates on early profits.' Greenpeace, which has launched a legal challenge against fracking in Britain, estimates that up to 20 million acres (32,000 square miles) of countryside are being assessed by the government.","Villages could get Â£100,000 and one per cent of profits from every well .

The woman whose search for the son she was forced to give up for adoption inspired the film Philomena has slammed a U.S. critic who branded it 'anti-Catholic and anti-Republican'. Philomena, which stars Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, tells the story of Philomena Lee, an Irish woman who was forced by nuns to give up her three-year-old son Anthony having fallen pregnant as a teenager. After keeping silent about her loss for 50 years she tells her story to journalist Martin Sixsmith, played by Coogan, and the pair travel to America in an attempt to trace Anthony. In a scathing review in the New York Post, Kyle Smith described the film as '90 minutes of organised hate', . the sole purpose of which was to 'simultaneously attack Catholics and . Republicans'. He brands the key characters as a 'ninny and a jerk' and goes on to describe the film as 'a sugary slice of arsenic cake'. But . the review prompted Ms Lee to write to Smith in support of the film . arguing that he had had missed the point entirely and pointing out that, . despite her experience, she is a proud Catholic. Ms . Lee's letter, which was placed as full-page advert in the New York . Times by the film's producer Harvey Weinstein, states the movie is . supposed to be a 'testament to good things, not an attack'. She writes: 'Your review of the movie paints its story as being a condemnation of Catholicism and conservative views.

Hiding behind large sunglasses and swathed in a full-length black coat, the Countess of Lucan went practically unnoticed as she walked through the streets of central London. Pictured days before a new ITV drama is to air about the Lord Lucan mystery, his wife Veronica, 75, was spotted in Belgravia, where she lives in a small mews house close to the murder scene. Nearly 40 years after since the murder of the family's nanny in what was believed to have been a botched attempt to kill Lady Lucan, a new documentary will claim the 7th Earl of Lucan was murdered by the criminals he had hired to help him escape the murder. Lady Lucan, who bore the peer three children, refused to cooperate with the producers of the drama, entitled Lucan, as did her lawyer daughter, Camilla Bloch. She is thought to have been the target for the murderer who killed her children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, at their home in Lower Belgrave Street. Lady Lucan was herself badly injured in the attack and when she was able to make a statement afterwards, she named her husband as the man who attacked her and killed their nanny. Last month she said: âI donât think it is right that a criminal matter should be used for entertainment. 'The film is based on the most absurd book I have ever read on the Lucan affair so I didnât think it was sensible to have anything to do with it.â Her daughter, Lady Camilla Bloch QC, who was four when her nanny was murdered and her mother attacked, said: 'As a lawyer I hope itâs not old-fashioned to point out that my father never stood trial.

John Pearsonâs 2005 book The Gamblers, all about the high-society . figures who were members of John Aspinallâs Clermont Club in Mayfair. Pearson believes Lucan had underworld contacts whom he had enlisted to dispose of Lady Lucanâs body after he had killed her. Lady Lucan has not cooperated with the makers of the new programme about the events of November 1974 . The 7th Earl of Lucan, pictured here on his engagement in 1963 to Veronica Duncan, went missing in 1974 . Usually-bald actor Rory Kinnear plays the aristocrat who spent a lot of time at John Aspinall's Clermont Club . However, when his plans went awry the gangsters then decided Lord Lucan himself had to be got rid of as well, before he was caught, because they feared he would reveal their role in his plans to police. The show's makers say they have gone to great lengths to piece toegther what they believe are the precise details of the crime. The two-part documentary, which also stars Christopher Eccleston as John Aspinall and Catherine McCormack as Veronica Lucan, begins tomorrow night at 9pm. Born Veronica Duncan, she married John Bingham in March 1963 and the newlyweds moved into a large house in Lower Belgrave Street in London's Belgravia, not far from the Clermont Club where he liked to play cards. Soon after, Bingham's father died and the gambling-mad old Etonian inherited the title, becoming the seventh Earl of Lucan. In 1964 their first child, daughter Frances, was born, followed by their only son, George, in 1967, and another daughter, Camilla, in 1970. Doomed partnership: Lord and Lady Lucan at the Coliseum in Rome in Easter 1969 . After each birth Lady Lucan suffered badly from postnatal depression, and she was treated with antidepressants. While her husband was initially sympathetic, the couple began rowing.Â  As his gambling debts began to mount up, and rumours spread about domestic violence, the marriage fell apart and in 1973 Lord Lucan moved out of the family home and into a flat in nearby Elizabeth Street. Lady Lucan stayed at the big house and looked after the three small children with the help of nanny Sandra Rivett. Lord Lucan wanted custody of the children and hired a private investigator to spy on her but she won full custody in 1973.Â  He reportedly told more than one person that he wanted to kill his wife so he could move back into the family home and be with his children.

The iconic images was taken in Ann Arbor, Michigan, during clashes between the Ku Klux Klan and anti-clan protestors. In June 1996 the Klan held a rally outside the city hall with a small group of Klansmen dressed in white robes and hoods. Photographer Mark Brunner has spoken about the enduring legacy of the pictures he took of a black teenager shielding a man from anti-KKK protestors in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1996 . Police dressed in riot gear and armed with tear gas were also present to protect the Klansmen from an estimated 300 people protesting against them.

Then a woman with a megaphone shouted, âThere's a Klansman in the crowd.â In a split second the crowd turned from peaceful protesters into an angry mob baying for blood. There were shouts of âKill the Naziâ and the man began to run - but he was knocked to the ground. A group quickly surrounded him, kicking him and hitting him with their placards. Then suddenly a black teenager in the group â 18-year-old Keshia Thomas â separated herself from the mob and threw herself on the man to protect him.

The frozen body of legendary explorer George Mallory was spotted by a fellow pioneer on the slopes of Everest decades before the remains were finally recovered, a forgotten diary has revealed. Frank Smythe, who made several attempts on the world's highest peak in the 1930s, wrote that he saw what he believed to be the remains on Mallory and his partner Andrew Irvine through a powerful telescope in 1936. Mr Smythe's report is the only sighting of Mallory's remains before they were eventually found by Conrad Anker in 1999. It was mentioned in a letter to Edward Norton, who led the expedition in 1924 when Mallory disappeared in a bid for the summit. Legendary: George Mallory, pictured left in the Alps in 1909, and right during the First World War, died attempting to scale Everest on an expedition in 1924 . A copy of the letter was found in the back of the explorer's diary by his son, Tony Smythe, while researching a book about this father's life. According to the Observer, the letter said: 'I was scanning the face from base camp . through a high-powered telescope last year when I . saw something queer in a gully below the scree shelf. 'Of course it was a . long way away and very small, but I've a six/six eyesight and do not . believe it was a rock. 'This object was at precisely the point where . Mallory and Irvine would have fallen had they rolled on over the scree . slopes.' Mr Smythe explained that he felt compelled to search the area as it was directly above the point at which a previous expedition found an ice axe, which is believed to have marked the scene of a fatal accident. Although Mr Smythe, a prolific author, wrote extensively about his expeditions, he left out details of the sighting of Mallory, and made clear in his letter to Mr Norton that it was not to be written about, in case it triggered a storm of media speculation.

Mr Smythe reached 28,200ft in an expedition in 1933, less than 800ft from the summit, but had to turn back.

The disease which causes a curve in an erect penis affects 5% of U.S. men (pictured posed by a model) Scroll down for video . The Food and Drug Administration today approved the first drug to treat an unusual condition that causes painful, curved erections in men. The agency said it approved the biotech drug Xiaflex to treat Peyronie's disease, which causes an abnormal bend in the penis during erection. The disease is caused by scar tissue and can lead to pain and other difficulties during sex. FDA says the injectable drug is the first non-surgical treatment for the disease. Drugmaker Auxilium Pharmaceuticals estimates five percent of U.S. men are affected. Xiaflex was previously approved in 2010 to treat a hand disease that interferes with patients' ability to straighten their fingers. The FDA said in its release that Xiaflex is believed to treat Peyronie's disease by breaking down collagen plaque that builds up in the penis and causes the deformity. The FDA said it is limiting distribution of the drug to certified physicians and health care centers due to serious potential side effects, including injury of the penis. Health care professionals must enroll and complete a training program before prescribing the drug. The FDA approved Xiaflex for its new use based on two studies of 832 men with Peyronie's disease. Patients received up to eight injections of the drug and were then followed for a year to see if their condition improved. Patients who received the drug reported significantly fewer problems than those who received a dummy injection. The drug was developed by BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. of Lynbrook, N.Y., and submitted to the FDA by Chesterbrook, Pa.-based Auxilium Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Mr Aldenâs mother-in-law Mary Bennett added: 'He was trying to climb up a ladder to get into an open window for an elderly lady who was locked out of her flat. 'The parapet which was rotten gave way and he hit the ground, sustaining a massive fracture and brain injury.' 'The ladder fell sideways and he was hanging onto the parapet, but the wood was all rotten and it collapsed.

'He landed on his feet on an incline and fell backwards, hitting his head on a metal grating. Itâs typical of David that he went to help somebody.' Mr Alden, who has children named Lucy, Vicky and James, had been living in Sidcup, Kent, but returned to Paignton eight weeks ago. His family described him as 'a popular, sociable man known to many from his days driving the No.12 bus in Torbay'. They revealed Mr Aldenâs organs have been donated to save others. Mrs Bennett added: 'Davidâs organs were donated to save, we are told, at least 12 other peopleâs lives across the country. We were told that his heart and lungs went to save a young person. 'He will forever be missed by his wife Theresa and his three beautiful children.' Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed they received a call from a woman who was locked out of her flat.

A British father and his six-year-old son suffered horrific second-degree burns when their speedboat exploded into a fireball in Brazil. Robbie Weich, 39, and his son Luca were trapped on the boat when it caught fire, while Mr Weich's wife Renata and their friends was thrown into the water from the blast. The London-based family members were on on a summer holiday in Brazil when they decided to take a river trip from the northern city of Belem, capital of the state of Para. But father-of-two Mr Weich said they were rocked by a 'massive explosion' just 30 seconds into the journey. While . Mrs Weich and two friends were thrown into the water from the back of . the boat, the rest of the group were stuck on the blazing craft. 'We realised we were literally on fire,' said Mr Weich, who was badly burned on his forearm, face and legs. Mr Weich and his cousin jumped in the water, but in the chaos he did not realise his son was still on board with a friend, who was holding onto him. Luca was rescued by others in their party at the scene, but he was already badly burnt on his forearms. The injured were all taken to the nearest state hospital in Belem. There were not enough beds for all of them in the burns unit, so Mr Weich ended up in a general ward, lying next to casualties who had been 'shot and stabbed'. As well as enduring the agonising burns, Mr Weich was also battling a dangerous infection he picked up in the water. Treatment: Mr Reich's injuries were so severe he was airlifted 6,000 miles back to London for specialist treatment at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital . His injuries were so severe he was airlifted 6,000 miles back to London for specialist treatment at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Mrs Weich was not badly injured in the accident so she stayed with Luca for the week it took for him to recover. 'His burns really healed so well - he has had no scarring,' said Mr Weich. 'We are all home now and recovering well with no lasting damage or permanent scarring.' And that's when Mr Weich's luck took an unusual turn. He was presented with a Porsche 4x4 after winning a competition through company Best Of The Best. Lucky win: After recovering well the businessman now has a double reason to celebrate - he has just won a new Â£58,000 Porsche Cayenne . William Hindmarch, the boss of Best Of The Best - which gives away a dream car every two weeks through competitions in airports, shopping centres and online - was on hand to personally hand over the keys to the Porsche Cayenne, and a bottle of bubbly for good measure. Mr Weich, a regular air traveller to Brazil with his wood importing business, said the win was surreal. He said: 'You think you would run up and down about it, but when it happened to me I was basically in shock. 'I think after the accident you start to think that I could have died,' he said. Life is too short - I am going to enjoy this car now with my family and friends.' Mr Weich has since returned to Brazil and said he planned to visit Belem with a box of his children's unwanted toys, so they could be used to cheer up sick children in the hospital that cared for his family. He said: 'It is one of the first things I will be doing - seeing all the people who helped us through, going and taking this donation down to the hospital. 'The people were just absolutely fantastic. Even at the marina there was a doctor who specialised in burns. 'The people there have got the same professional level, but the resources and the infrastructure are not the same.'","Robbie Weich, 39, and his Luca were trapped on the boat when it exploded .

Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness recently returned from a trade mission in the US. Yesterday when a letter bomb was delivered to the offices of the Prosecution Service in LondonderryÂ  a stretch of the city's Limavady Road was sealed. Army explosives experts were called to the offices at Foyle Chambers, which had to be evacuated by staff. Last Friday, similar devices were discovered addressed to Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Matt Baggott and Chief Inspector John Burrows, the police commander in Derry.

Officers escaped injury when pipe bombs were thrown at patrol vehicles in Newtownabbey, Co Antrim, and in Derry city centre. Dissidents also claimed responsibility for firebombing a shop in Belfast city centre recently. The threat from extremists opposed to the peace process has been deemed severe by the Home Office. They have been responsible for the deaths of two soldiers, two police officers and a prison guard in recent years.

New York's attorney general has asked for secret documents about the 1971 Attica state prison riot to be unsealed in an attempt to reveal exactly what happened during the bloodiest prison rebellion in U.S. history. Eric Schneiderman wants a court in Wyoming County to open hundreds of detailed pages about the five-day riot which happened in September 1971 when inmates took control of the maximum-security prison in rural western New York before state troopers and guards stormed the building and fatally shot 29 inmates and 10 hostages. Schneiderman said it is time to bring transparency to what he referred to as one of the state government's darkest chapters. Riot: Prison guard hostages and inmates gather in the exercise yard of cell block D inside Attica State Prison in New York on September 9, 1971 . The sealed documents are part of a 1975 report that examined New York's efforts to investigate the riot and its aftermath at Attica Correctional Facility. Mr Schneiderman said: 'It is important, both for families directly affected and for future generations, that these historical documents be made available so the public can have a better understanding of what happened and how we can prevent future tragedies.' He noted the historical significance and the fact that all related criminal and civil litigation has ended. After 40 years, he said, the privacy concerns can be addressed more narrowly by omitting only the names of many grand jury witnesses and some people identified in testimony. Among those seeking the records are the Forgotten Victims of Attica, a group of prison employees who survived and relatives of those who died. Gary Morton, a lawyer representing the group, said this year: 'For families that lost their father, son, brother because they were killed in D Yard, they yearn to know the truth of how their loved one died and why they died. Inmates of Attica State Prison (right) negotiate with Commissioner Russell Oswald (lower left) inside the jail where prisoners took control . Prison guards and New York State troopers gather outside Attica State Prison on September 13, 1971, after re-taking it from inmates who rioted for five days . Inmates wearing cloaks and football helmets stand behind bars in a corridor leading to D block on September 10, 1971, as they begin negotiations with New York State officials after the uprising at Attica State Prison . 'Some of that has come out, but certainly there's a lot more that hasn't come out.' Eleven staff and 32 inmates died - all but four were shot by troopers and officers who fired hundreds of rounds in six minutes storming the prison's D Yard on September 13, 1971. An additional 89 men were wounded. The inmates were demanding better conditions and amnesty for the riot itself. Prison guards and New York State troopers gather outside Attica Prison before they enter to re-take the maximum-security jail on September 13, 1971 . Known as the Meyer Commission Report after the judge who headed the investigation, the 570-page document was divided into volumes. The first with findings and recommendations was released but the others were sealed in 1981. Published four years after the riot, the first volume said 62 inmates had been indicted for various offences, but the grand jury investigation should continue and consider all possible crimes by authorities. The original grand jury refused to indict in four cases brought against law enforcement personnel. One trooper was later indicted on a charge of reckless endangerment in 1975. The commission report emphasised 'important omissions' in the evidence gathered by state police afterward and the possible conflict of interest with troopers investigating their fellow officers' actions in retaking the prison. It found no intentional cover-up by prosecutors but faulted police for bad planning and failing to account for the rifles, shotguns and pistols used and bullets, slugs and buckshot fired by individual officers. Governor Hugh Carey effectively ended official scrutiny of the uprising in 1976 when he pardoned seven inmates and barred disciplinary action against 20 of the troopers and prison guards among the hundreds of officers who retook the prison. He also reduced the murder sentence of inmate John Hill, who was found guilty of beating guard William Quinn to death. The report concluded Quinn and three inmates were killed by prisoners. Schiederman's request was filed late Friday. It isn't clear when the judge will rule. In 2005, the state reached a $12million settlement with survivors and families of prison staff caught in the uprising. About 150 claims were filed.That followed a settlement for $8million five years earlier with 502 former inmates and families of those killed or injured, who claimed they were beaten, tortured and denied medical treatment after the prison was retaken. Audiotapes published in 2011 showed President Richard Nixon offering support by phone to then Governor Nelson Rockefeller hours after the siege ended. 'You . did the right thing. It's a tragedy that these poor fellows were shot . but I just want you to know that's my view and I've told the troops . around here that I back that right to the hilt,' he said. While Rockefeller initially praised the work of state police sharp shooters and called the retaking 'a beautiful operation' a day later, he acknowledged 'a little problem' â that most hostages were killed by gunfire, not by inmates as initially believed.","Eric Schneiderman wants a court to open hundreds of detailed pages about the five-day riot in September 1971 .

Ella Oliver's mother Jenny, 27, entered her into the Miss Natural Sparkle UK contest before she was even born. Mother-of-three Jenny, from Blackpool, was seven months pregnant - and knew she was carrying a girl - when she sat down to register her unborn baby into the competition. Ella Oliver has become Britain's youngest ever beauty queen despite being just nine weeks old . Ella was born by caesarean on July 23 weighing 7lb 7oz and just 68 days later her doting mother dressed her up and carried her down the catwalk to be judged. Jenny wanted Ella to follow in the footsteps of sister Jess, seven, who takes to the stage kitted out with make-up, wash-off fake tan and press-on nails. Former child minder Jenny, who paid Â£10 to enter Ella, said: 'I didn't put any make-up on Ella because she is too young for that, so she was natural. 'She wore a really pretty pink dress and head band, she even smiled for the judges. 'She didn't have to do a talent or show confidence because she can't walk or talk so I think it was judged on cuteness. 'I don't know if Ella wants to do pageants but I don't think it will damage her. Jenny Oliver registered Ella into the Miss Natural Sparkle UK contest after discovering she was having a girl . 'She doesn't know what she's doing so it won't affect her at that age. 'If she tells me when she is older she doesn't want to do that's fine and that's her choice.' Pint-sized Ella was crowned with her first sash and tiara. Despite coming under fire from fellow parents, Jenny and mechanic husband Steve, 29, will continue to chaperone their daughters to pageants across the country. They have already been to 10 different contests and spent more than Â£2,000 pounds on dresses, shoes, travel, hotels and accessories in the past three years on Jess. Jenny, who also has a son Stephen, six, added: 'Three years ago Jess watched Baby Beauty Queens on BBC3 and said she wanted to do something like that. 'I didn't know anything about pageants so researched it a bit. 'I entered a contest by sending a photo of Jess to the organiser out of curiosity. Jenny wanted Ella to follow in the footsteps of sister Jess, seven, who already competes . 'We didn't hear anything for ages but then one day we got a phone call offered her a place. 'That was the start of our pageant life. 'Jess didn't win but she really enjoyed it and said she wanted to do more. 'When she was a toddler she used to play with mud and dirt but as she got older she became more girly - you won't find her in a tracksuit now. 'I remember going to parents evening afterwards and the teacher said she couldn't believe the difference in confidence in her. 'I told her about the pageant and I can only presume that had made her change from being such a shy reserved girl. Seven-year-old Jess has enjoyed taking part in pageants since watching Baby Beauty Queens . 'I hope Ella will gain as much confidence as Jess through pageants.' Leanne Woodall, Miss Natural Sparkle organiser, said: 'Because beauty pageants are a family event and the whole family like to be involved we decided to introduce just one round for newborns this year. 'Parents dressed their babies up in little dresses or suits. 'It was judged on cute factor and Ella won. We thought she looked adorable in a little pink dress and head band.

An Arizona man has murdered his four neighbors and killed their two dogs because the canines wouldn't stop barking loudly, police have revealed. Michael Dante Guzzo, 56, became enraged over the noise from the pets at a neighboring townhouse in a Phoenix apartment complex on Saturday, detectives say. They believe he used a pump-action shotgun to shoot dead Bruce Moore, 66; his daughter, Renee Moore, 36; her husband Michael Moore, 42; and their son, Shannon Moore, 17. He also slaughtered their dogs. Heavy response: Phoenix SWAT police stormed Michael Dante Guzzo's apartment following the rampage - only to find him dead by his own hand . Guzzo then fired several rounds into the door of another neighbor. He returned home and killed himself. Several of Guzzo's neighbors say he was a quiet man who had lived alone in the community for several years. They were shocked by his sudden violent rampage. 'I've seen him every morning - come in quiet every morning,' Donald McKenzie told KSAZ-TV. 'Never would expect him to be the guy who did this at all.' Police say they may never know for certain what prompted the massacre because Guzzo took his own life. Neighbors say they were shocked that Guzzo - a quiet man who lived alone - was capable of such violence . However, they believe the altercation was the result of an argument over the Moores' dogs. Renee Moore ran a dog grooming business. Police found two of Guzzo's victims on the patio outside their townhouse. Two others were shot dead inside the home. Witnesses described watching Guzzo stroll through the complex with his shotgun after the killings. 'When I walked outside, I saw a middle aged gentleman with a big shotgun in his hand,' Barry Hatchett told KNXV-TV. 'Had it thrown over his shoulder actually. And then he spoke to someone across the way. And what he said was, ""You didnât think I seen you home boy?"" Then he pumped the gun and he shot it.' Libni DeLeon said the gunman knocked then fired two shots through the door. His front door is peppered with holes from the shotgun blast. Libni was not injured.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they were investigating the death of an officer in a 'horrific incident' but denied media reports it was an assassination. Mojtaba Ahmadi, an official of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was found shot dead near Karaj, a town northwest of the capital Tehran, the Iranian website Alborz reported earlier this week. He had left his house on Monday morning and was found a few hours later with a bullet in his heart, the website said. Mojtaba Ahmadi was reportedly found shot dead in the heart near Karaj. He was a member of the elite Guards (file photo) The elite Revolutionary Guards have roughly 125,000 military personnel, including ground, aerospace and naval forces. The Daily Telegraph reported that Ahmadi was a commander of the unit's Cyber War Headquarters and quoted a local police commander as saying it was an assassination. The commander of the local police reportedly said two people on a motorbike had been involved in the assassination. 'I could see two bullet wounds on his body and the extent of his injuries indicated that he had been assassinated from a close range with a pistol,' an eyewitness told the Alborz website. The commander of the local police said that two people on a motorbike had been involved in the assassination. Iran's new President Hasan Rouhani has moved to reduce the presence of the country's elite military unit in Tehran's next government . The death has triggered further accusations that outside powers are carrying out targeted assassinations of key figures in the countryâs security apparatus. The Telegraph speculated that the death could have been an assassination, similar to those of five Iranian nuclear scientists since 2007. 'In the wake of a horrific incident involving one of the IRGC officials ... the matter is being investigated and the main reason of the event and the motive of the attacker has not been specified,' said an IRGC statement, quoted by Sepah news, Iran's military news. Sepah, which is operated by the . Revolutionary Guard, ran its report under the headline 'Denial of news . reports of the assassination of one of IRGC's officials'. An Iranian Revolutionary Guard cyber warfare chief is reportedly shot dead but officials deny it was an assassination (file photo) The statement did not identify Ahmadi but a local news website published pictures on Wednesday showing his funeral procession, along with text excerpts of the IRGC communique. 'The result of investigation will be announced through official channels and any speculation will not be appropriate before the investigation is over,' an Iranian official said today. Western officials have not commented on the incident. Iran has been accused of mounting cyber attacks against Western targets in recent years, and has itself been the target of suspected U.S. attacks on computer systems at its nuclear facilities using a virus called Stuxnet. For their part, authorities in Tehran have accused Israel and its Western allies of carrying out a series of assassinations against Iranian nuclear scientists. The last such attack happened in January 2012 when one man was killed by a car bomb. Israel regards Iran's nuclear activities as an existential threat and has applied diplomatic pressure on the West to force Iran to curb its nuclear programme. Tehran maintains it has only peaceful goals. Shashank Joshi, an expert at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), told The Telegraph: 'Iranâs cyber attacks on Israel and elsewhere in the region are a rising threat and a growing threat, but it hasnât yet been seen as a major and sustained onslaught.'","Mojtaba Ahmadi, an official of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards, was found with a bullet in his heart .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 14:56 EST, 30 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:16 EST, 31 October 2013 . President Obama said Wednesday that he has 'complete confidence' in Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, just hours after she took a beating during a congressional hearing over the disastrous Obamacare website. His defense of Sebelius came after she was forced to concede on Capitol Hill that Obama, not she, was ultimately responsible for the Affordable Care Act's rocky launch. 'The president has complete . confidence . in Secretary Sebelius,' White House Deputy Press Secretary Joshua . Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the president's speech in Boston, where he offered full-throated oratory on the importance of his signature health insurance overhaul. Earnest focused on Sebelius' early apology rather than on her later concession that the buck stops in the Oval Office. She 'took responsibility for many of the problems that are . evident with the website, but she also deserves credit for the other . aspects of the Affordable Care Act implementation that have gone well,' he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Problerms: Obama faces a disaffected public that has grown weary of health care promises and is less confident than ever about the wisdom of the Affordable Care Act . Grand: Obama used the historic Faneuil Hall in Boston today to double down on his vision for Obamacare - but admitted he's 'not happy' about the website roll-out . The embattled face of the health insurance overhaul law and . its disastrous Internet enrollment platform had said in her opening statement, 'You deserve better. I apologize.' But later during her testimony Wednesday before the . House Energy and Commerce Committee, Sebelius was muscled into sharing . blame for the glitch-prone rollout with her boss in the White House. Mississippi . Republican Rep. Gregg Harper pressed her on who is ultimately to blame . for a website that wasn't adequately tested before its October 1 launch, . and crashed Wednesday morning, rendering it out of service during most . of Sebelius' 3-1/2 hour grilling. 'The . president ultimately is responsible,' Harper insisted. 'While I think . itâs great that youâre a team player and youâre taking responsibility, . it is the presidentâs ultimate responsibility, correct?' 'Uh, whatever,' she sniped while shaking her head. 'Yes, he is the president. He is responsible for government programs.' Less than five hours later, Obama proudly drew parallels between his Obamacare program and former Gov. Romney's, begun seven years ago in Boston. 'There were early problems to solve,' when Romney reformed health insurance programs there, he said, just as his program's rollout has been plagued with poor management, technical failures and organizational snafus. 'There were changes that had to be made.' And of his own program, he admitted, 'The web site is too slow, too many people have gotten stuck and I'm not happy about it.' Obama recalled happily how 36,000 Massachussets citizens signed up for Romney care in the first year, a pace that would leave Obamacare short by millions of taxpayers . Adoring throng: A crowd estimated at 800 clapped and cheered for Obama as he reinforced his vision of a government-managed health insurance market . Interruption: Protesters yelled in unison about the Keystone XL pipeline as Obama quipped that they were at the wrong rally . 'Enrollment was extremely slow,' Obama recalled of Romney's experiment in government management of the insurance market. 'Within a month only about a hundred people had signed up. ... by the end of the year, 36,000 people had signed up.' Massachusetts comprises 2.1 per cent of the American population; at the same rate, the Obamacare program would only have 1.7 million new insurance enrollees by October 1, 2014. Administration officials have said they need 7 million to sign up â more than four times as many â in order for the Affordable Care Act's books to balance as its strains to cover health care costs of the elderly and chronically ill. Still, Obama claimed of Massachusetts, 'The vast majority of its citizens are happy with their coverage.' 'I'm confident this plan will work because the Massachusetts model has shown that it works,' he said repeatedly to wild applause from an estimated 800 partisans. Obama was interrupted twice by . screaming protesters upset about the construction of the Keystone XL . pipeline. 'That is the wrong rally,' he quipped, saying 'we had the . climate change rally back in the summer.' Campaigner-in-chief: Obama kissed babies and even signed an 'I (heart) Obamacare' cast as he greeted his supporters . Friendly faces: Obama is mobbed by supporters after his speech in which he said reforming healthcare was a 'no-brainer' Responding to complaints that insurers are dropping millions of Americans from their coverage, he declared that those policies were 'cut-rate plans' sold by 'bad apple insurers' who weren't offering benefits in line with what the Obamacare law requires. His GOP opponents have highlighted dozens of examples of constituents receiving cancellation letters, many of which cite the Affordable Care Act as the reason policies are being discontinued. One member of Congress brought his own such letter to a hearing on Wednesday. But 'Americans would be better off,' Obama jabbed, if Republicans put as much energy into helping the Affordable Care Act succeed nationally as they put into criticizing it. Romneycare is a statewide plan, . instituted by Obama's one-time Republican election foe Mitt Romney when he was . governor of Massachusetts, that formed part of the template the . president used when his team formulated the Affordable Care Act. The hearing was rife with stories . about taxpayers who have lost their medical coverage because of new . requirements forced on insurance companies by the Obamacare law, and . included a contentious exchange in which Sebelius said she wouldn't â or . couldn't â buy health insurance through the government's insurance . exchanges herself. 'Why aren't you losing your insurance?â Colorado Republican Rep. Cory Gardne demanded. 'Why wonât you go into this exchange?' Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius apologized to a congressional committee for wasting Americans' time as they tried and failed to use the crippled Obamacare website . The most hated woman in America? Sebelius is staying put, said Obama's aide, despite the woeful performance of the program she's leading . 'I think itâs illegal for me,' she replied, citing the employer-sponsored insurance she already enjoys as a federal government employee. She later said she would 'gladly join the exchange' if she weren't already covered. 'You can decide to drop the coverage from your employer,' Gardner insisted. 'You have the choice to decide not to choose [it].' Healthcare.gov â when it's up and running â advises people in Sebelius' position, however, that 'f youâd like to explore Marketplace coverage options you can.' She would, however, be required to forgo taxpayers' contribution toward her coverage. As a 65-year-old who is enrolled in . Medicare Part A, Sebelius could also reject that coverage if she chose to, . relying solely on exchange-driven insurance as millions of Americans are . contemplating as they find policy cancellation notices in their . mailboxes. That, though, would be a symbolic and impractical choice. Obama will follow his health insurance speech with an appearance at a Democratic fundraiser on Wednesday night, but will return to Washington without seeing the sixth game of the World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals. The president, Earnest reminded reporters, is a Chicago White Sox fan. 'I am well aware that a presidential visit is not the biggest thing going on today in Boston,' the president said during his speech. 'I promise we will be done here in time for everybody here to head over to Fenway.'","'The president has complete confidence in Secretary Sebelius,' said a White House spokesman .

Kathryn, 22, believes she would have longer to life if doctors had been able to find her more suitable liver and bone marrow transplants . A 22-year-old who has been battling leukaemia for six years has said her ill health could have been prevented if more people were registered as donors. Kathryn Cartwright of Sutton Coldfield believes she would have longer to live if doctors had been able to find her a suitable bone marrow match when she was 16. Kathryn, who was forced to undergo a second transplant and liver replacement in later years, is now unsure if she will see her 23rd birthday in January. After being diagnosed with the disease, Kathryn's older sister stepped in to donate her own bone marrow, a move which was boosted by chemotherapy. But after several months the teenager's health continued to deteriorate. 'I . found lumps in my face which turned out to be malignant tumours, and . tests revealed that my bone marrow was full of cancer again,' she recalls. She required a second transplant from a donor in Germany, after which doctors told her she had a 20 per cent chance at life. Though she surpassed doctor's expectations, Kathryn discovered she had developed graft-versus-host-virus disease (GvHD) shortly after the second operation. 'This is when the donor cells recognise the recipient's cells as foreign and they attack', she explains. 'It can happen in any of the systems of the body, and I've had it almost everywhere. 'I had it in my skin and my digestive system, but it was treated with several weeks of IV steroids. After receiving a bone marrow transplant from her sister Christine in 2008 and undergoing chemotherapy, doctors were hopeful Kathryn would make a recovery . Kathryn recalls how her skin turned yellow with jaundice as she was in desperate need of a new liver . 'Then . in the September I got it in my eyes. I lived in the dark for a month . because it made me incredibly photophobic. 'It was eventually treated . with eye drops made from stem cells from my own blood' As a result, Kathryn was hospitalised on Halloween 2008 - and did not return home until June the following year. Kathryn has undergone rounds of chemotherapy as well as the transplants throughout her six-year battle . It was during this time she received a liver transplant. But, as she was in such bad health, doctors selected an organ of a different blood type to try to keep her alive. Though the operation, which took place on December 21, was a success, experts didn't believe the teenager would be alive at Christmas. 'My donor was a different blood type to me - I was A-positive, but I received an O-negative liver because I was so poorly. 'While . the haematology doctors were still monitoring me, they discovered an . anomaly in one of my test results - the DNA in my bone marrow had . changed. 'It wasn't me. Neither was it my sister, nor the German donor. 'What happened was that the stem cells from the liver had travelled to my bone marrow, kicked out the German and set up shop. 'I . had effectively had a third accidental bone marrow transplant - I'm the . only person in the world for all this to happen to. 'There's a . scientific paper being written about me.' As more GvHD spread through her body, Kathryn's lung capacity reduced to just 50 to 60 per cent, and she was forced to start using a wheelchair. Kathryn stunned experts by reaching her 21st birthday last year after being told she only had a 20 per cent chance of survival . 'This . wasn't such a problem when my new liver was working fine. But in 2011 I . got biliary stones. They're basically the same as gallstones.' Though . this was temporarily resolved with the creation of a new bile duct, . Kathryn's liver is now failing to drain properly, causing infection . which is resistant to antibiotics. As . such, her only hope of survival is a new liver transplant - a prospect . which is becoming less likely as her respiratory function continues to . falter. Last year Kathryn was told it would be too much of a risk to her health to perform a second liver transplant . Kathryn recalls the moment doctors told her she wasn't eligible for a second transplant as the procedure would involve too much risk, describing the news as 'like being punched in the face'. 'It was . decided that I couldn't have a transplant because they would probably . not be able to get me off the ventilator post-surgery - and that's if I . survived the operation at all.' Speaking of her family's reaction to the life-threatening news, she said: 'We know everything is not going to be . all right, but for now we are just carrying on the best we can.' Though heartbroken, the 22-year-old says she is 'not surprised' by doctor's decisions as there merely aren't enough people willing to donate organs or bone marrow. 'I am going to die because not enough people are on the donor registers. 'One in three people die while on the waiting list for an organ, and it is so unnecessary. 'People die because they can't find suitable bone marrow donors, and that shouldn't happen when signing up and donating is so easy - no one has to die to donate bone marrow like they do with an organ. 'I have been to too many funerals that could have been prevented if more people were on the registers.' As well as a trip to America and celebrating Christmas, Kathryn wishes to use her remaining time 'spreading the word about organ and bone marrow donation'. 'I have things I want to do, I don't want to go before I've done them. The 22-year-old has said she will spend her remaining time campaigning for bone marrow donation so others don't find themselves in her situation . 'I want to try and stop this from happening to anyone else,' she said, adding: 'So many people ""mean to do it"", but never do - and it is so simple.' 'I want to get to Christmas and my birthday but I don't know what's going to happen. And God, I am so scared.' Kathryn has been documenting her condition and campaign for bone marrow and organ donation awareness on her blog which has received 5,000 views in just six days.","Kathryn Cartwright has been battling leukaemia since she was 16 .

The 15ft-tall white 'tree', which looks like a piece of material stretched over a cone, was erected in Stockton last week. Locals have since called it a 'disgrace', an 'embarrassment' and one said on Facebook that it looks like a 'dunce's hat'. A 15ft tall Christmas tree structure on Stockton High Street has been met with derision from locals who have branded it 'pathetic' and 'an eyesore' Anne Chivers, 64, a retired grandmother, of Stockton, said: 'It is a complete disgrace. 'It is absolutely awful. How can anyone put a thing like that up and think it is OK to pass it off as a Christmas tree? 'The lights are God awful, and it is simply an embarrassment to the town. It's like an upside down cornet. 'I will be taking my grandchildren to see the switching on of the lights somewhere else this year. 'It's the kind of thing you might put up in your garden if you wanted to annoy the neighbours. It's a joke.' A picture of the tree has been posted on Facebook, with residents taking to the social networking website to criticise it. Locals have branded the structure a 'disgrace' and an 'embarrassment'.

A Stockton Council spokesman said: 'We're in the middle of a multi-million pound redevelopment of the High Street. 'The central and northern sections are quite literally a building site, so there's no room for our normal 40-ft high Spruce, which will be back next year. 'In the interim we've used the 20ft cone with illuminated snowflake designs, rather than leave this part of the High Street bare. 'We're pleased to report that the extensive works have not put visitors off as thousands of spectators attended last weekâs launch of the Stockton Sparkles festival, which was led by 1,500 carol-singing children. 'We know that a traditional Christmas tree always makes a great centrepiece but there's so much more going on in Stockton throughout the Christmas period including our 12-day Christmas market, ice sculpture, late night shopping and street theatre with dance and musical performances. 'We would ask that our public bear with us this year and look forward to a traditional Christmas tree returning to a new-look Stockton High Street next year â we're sure it will be worth the wait!

Beth Warren and her husband dreamt of having two children â a boy and a girl. But he died of cancer before they could start a family and she has launched a legal battle to give her the chance of realising the dream. Mrs Warren, 28, wants more time to decide whether to have IVF treatment using sperm that her husband had frozen before his death. The couple had been together eight years and married in a hospice six weeks before Warren Brewer, a ski instructor, died from a brain tumour aged just 32. He had agreed that the samples could be used to allow his wife to have their child after his death but, under the law, the samples will be destroyed within months. Mrs Warren admits she may never be ready to have her late husbandâs child. But she needs more time to decide whether to have a baby who will never meet its father. She is not only grieving for her husband, but also her brother, Edward, a policeman who was killed in a car crash just weeks before Mr Brewerâs death in February 2012. Mrs Warren, who took her husbandâs Christian name as her surname after his death, wants to be financially secure before bringing a child into the world. The physiotherapist from Birmingham said: âI am still trying to make myself happy again â you donât have a child because you are lonely and heartbroken. I need to make myself whole again.Â  I want to be financially settled as well, so that my child can have everything I had. I am just a normal person who loved someone very, very much and lost them.â Widow: Beth Warren, 28, has been told by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority that the sperm cannot be stored beyond April 2015 . After falling ill just ten months into . their relationship, Mr Brewer stored samples of sperm ahead of . gruelling cancer treatment that could leave him infertile. The storage . was time-limited and, over the years, he regularly extended it. He also explicitly agreed to the samples being used after his death. Now, . unless the storage period can be extended, the samples will be . destroyed in April 2015. This gives Mrs Warren little time to get over . her grief. Or to have IVF, a stressful and invasive process that may . have to be undergone several times. And even if she did have a baby soon, . the samples would be destroyed before she could use them to have the . equally longed-for second child. In . a case that will reignite the debate over the ethics of posthumous . conception, Mrs Warren is asking the High Court for the storage period . to be extended. Her solicitor James Lawford Davies said that her right to use the sperm in IVF is not in dispute. The legal issue is how long it can be stored for. The lawyer, whose firm is not charging for its work, said: âShe would like to be able to make the decision when she is ready.â The . fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, . said that it had âevery sympathyâ with Mrs Warren. However, the storage . period cannot be extended without her husbandâs consent. Mrs . Warren, who put her studies and career on hold to care for her dying . husband, said: âWe just fell head over heels in love. It was a long time . ago that we made plans that when we are engaged and married we would . have children. âIdeally weâd have a boy and a girl and we talked about names. I am just trying to do the right thing.â Mrs . Warren added: ââI have the full support of Warrenâs family in my legal . battle and in whatever decision I make, and they have told me how proud . they are of how I am dealing with the situation.â","Beth Warren, 28, from Birmingham said she needs more time to think .

The South African government announced that the formal state funeral will take place on December 15, capping off a 10-day mourning period. The Obamas are just two of a long list of international dignitaries who are expected to attend the memorial services. Emotional: President Obama was one of the first heads of state to pay tribute to the fallen leader and now the White House confirmed that he and Michelle would be traveling to South Africa for the memorial . Paying respects: Mr Obama ordered the flags of government buildings, including the White House pictured here Friday, to half mast through Monday . Last visit: Though the Obamas were in South Africa this summer, Mandela was too ill for visitors so the last time Michelle met the man was in June 2011 when she went to Africa with her daughters and without Barack . On Friday afternoon, former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura announced that they will be traveling to South Africa for the memorial. Former President Clinton, who was in office at the same time as Mandela, was very close to the leader and is going to the memorial alongside his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary. 'One of the things that sometimes gets lost... is that he was a very very good president. I think he was an extremely effective president of South Africa,' Mr Clinton said in an interview with CNN on Friday evening. 'He managed to be an inclusive figure while still managing to take a stand.' Prime Minister David Cameron has announced that he will be attending the funeral and Prince Charles is expected to join him. Connection: Obama only met Mandela once in person but did write a forward to his book . Several celebrities who had personal ties to the late great leader, such as Oprah Winfrey and U2 frontman Bono, are also expected to attend the service. Desmond Tutu, a long-time friend of Mr Mandela and former archbishop of Cape Town, is the clear frontrunner for leading the service. Mourners have gathered to dance and sing songs of freedom outside his home as the world celebrates the life of the adored statesman who brought peace and equality to his country and died last night aged 95. He passed away at home in Johannesburg at 8.50pm Thursday and his body was moved to a military hospital in Pretoria Friday morning, where he is under armed guard. South African president Jacob Zuma announced Friday afternoon that Mandelaâs state funeral will be held in Qunu, the village where he grew up, and will cap 10 days of national mourning. The first major event will be on December 10, where a memorial service will be held at the Johannesburg soccer stadium that hosted the 2010 World Cup final, and holds 94,000 people. Between December 11 and December 13 his embalmed body will lie in state in a glass-fronted coffin at the Union Buildings in Pretoria , where he was inaugurated as president on May 10, 1994. On day nine, plans have been made for a military aircraft to fly Mr Mandela to Mthatha, the main town in the South African province of Eastern Cape. His casket will then be taken by the military on a gun carriage to Qunu, his home village. In honour: Following the announcement of the death of Mandela, former President Bill Clinton, who is set to attend the state funeral, tweeted this 2007 picture captioned: 'I will never forget my friend Madiba' Joining: Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, eho met with then-94-year-old Mandela last August, will also journey to South Africa .

Lighter note: The two saw one another in Amsterdam in 2002 as well during the Dutch Royal wedding of Queen Beatrix's eldest son . After the ceremony, it is believed his body will be embalmed at the mortuary, thought to be a military hospital in Pretoria. No formal public events are expected to take place until day five, December 10, when mourners will have a chance to say goodbye to their beloved father figure during a service at the 94,000-capacity Johannesburg soccer stadium that hosted the 2010 World Cup.

Ian Innes discovered his daughter Cheryl (pictured) died when he phoned to find out what she wanted for Christmas . A heartbroken father has spoken of how he rang his daughter to find out what she wanted for Christmas only to discover she had died. Ian Innes contacted his daughter Cheryl after returning from holiday but was told by her partner that she had been dead for five weeks. Cheryl, 42, had Down's Syndrome and lived with her partner of four years, Glynn Bull, in Lytham, Lancashire. She died on October 18 of natural causes relating to her diabetes. But because of a fault on her phone, Mr Bull was unable to access her phone directory and so was unable to contact Mr Innes to tell him what had happened. Mr Innes, 61, said: 'Normally Cheryl contacts us to let us know what she wants for her birthday and Christmas. When she hadnât called I phoned her and her partner said she had died five weeks ago.' Mr Bull had told police where he thought Mr Innes lived but searches were unsuccessful. Mr Innes, of Longridge, said: 'It was such an absolute shock. Glynn was very upset and kept telling me he did the best he could but he wasnât able to save her. 'Iâd seen her before I went away and she seemed fine and chirpy. At least she was asleep and she still thinks sheâs asleep. Itâs our only comfort that she didnât suffer.' Mr Bull, 52, said: 'That day she was up and about as normal to take her tablets and her insulin but she told me she was tired and wanted to go back to bed. 'She told me to wake her up for her programmes. When I went to wake her up, she was gone.' Mr Bull immediately rang for an ambulance and a 999 operator talked him through CPR. He said: 'I looked after Cheryl - I put my heart and soul into looking after her. She was my friend and she was my life. She always made me smile.' Mr Innes said his daughter was a popular woman who enjoyed her independence. He said: 'Glynn loved her to bits and they were going to last forever.' Mr Innes said he was disappointed that no-one was able to contact him to tell him the news. He said: 'If I hadnât rung her it could have been Christmas before I went round. 'Someone would have to say she wasnât here any more, and thatâs horrendous.' Coroner's officer PC Ken Lord says he did everything he could to try to contact Miss Innesâ family, including searching the electoral register, contacting GPs and checking at hospitals.","Ian Innes contacted his daughter Cheryl after returning from holiday .

Official update: The South African government have today said former president Nelson Mandela remains in a 'stable but critical' condition . Nelson Mandela remains in a 'stable but critical' condition and 'continues to respond to treatment', the South African government has said today. The statement, the first official update on the former president's condition since he left hospital in September, said: 'The health of the former president . remains much the same.' It was released after President Jacob Zuma visited Mr Mandela at his home today. The 95-year-old is still receiving intensive care at home after being discharged from hospital on September 1. He was admitted three months earlier for a lung infection. The government has largely refused to give details about Mr Mandela's condition, citing the need for privacy, but said today 'he continues to recover'. Mr Mandela's oldest grandson, Mandla Mandela, who visited the former statesman on Sunday, said he found him in a 'good state. 'He is still progressing steadily but very much under a critical condition,' Mandla Mandela told reporters. However, Mandela's former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela this week told a local newspaper that he remains 'quite ill' and is unable to speak because of tubes being used to clear his lungs of liquid. He is using facial expressions to communicate, Ms Madikizela-Mandela added. The Nobel Peace Prize winner is under the care of 22 doctors. While his pneumonia has cleared, his lungs remain sensitive, Ms Madikizela-Mandela said, adding that it was 'difficult for him'. 'He remains very sensitive to any germs, so he has to be kept literally sterile. The bedroom there is like an ICU (intensive care unit) ward,' she told the Sunday Times. 'He remains quite ill, but thank God the doctors were able to pull him through from that (last) infection.' His lung problems date back to his time in jail when he was diagnosed with early stage tuberculosis. Mr Mandela, who spent 27 years in apartheid jails before becoming South Africa's first black leader, has faced several health scares. Infection: Mandela was discharged from hospital, where he had been for three months, on September 1 and taken by ambulance, pictured, to his home in Johannesburg where he receives intensive care . His most recent 86-day hospital stay was his longest since he walked free from prison in 1990. Mr Mandela has been in and out of hospital since last year with lung-related complications. A globally admired figure for steering South Africa peacefully into democracy, Mandela's health problems prompted outpourings of well wishes around the world. South Africa's presidency said Zuma had conveyed the well wishes of South Africans and of leaders who attended a recent Commonwealth summit in Sri Lanka. Zuma, according to his office, also told Mandela that he was 'looking forward' to officially opening the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory later in the day. Concern: The Nobel Peace Prize winner's former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, pictured, said this week that Mandela remains 'quite ill' and can only communicate through facial expressions . The president will inaugurate a multi-purpose centre that will run an exhibition on the life and times of South Africa's first black leader. The centre is located within the same complex that houses the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Houghton, an upmarket suburb north of Johannesburg. November 18 marks the day, 20 years ago, when a panel of political negotiators approved an interim constitution for South Africa and an electoral bill that would clear the way for the historic 27 April 1994 polls. Two days earlier, on 16 November 1993, Mr Mandela and the last apartheid-era president, FW de Klerk, had agreed on the basic points allowing for the country's first democratic election.","Government statement said Mandela's health 'remains much the same'

There's nothing quite like a tweet from a celebrity to boost sales of a product - and it seems it doesn't even have to be on Twitter. David Attenborough's Tweet of the Day programme - a radio broadcast of birdsong - has proved such a hit with listeners that retailers are reporting a surge in sales of bird-related items. The veteran wildlife expert is one of the hosts of the BBC Radio 4 series, which features a 90-second recording of a different bird each day. And it emerged yesterday that retailer Waterstones has seen sales of bird books double since the programme was first aired on Monday morning. It has also been noted that the RSPB Pocket Guide to British Birds is selling nearly twice as fast as last week. Meanwhile, internet retailer Amazon revealed that their two best-selling products in the bird category were birdsong audio CDs. Sales of British Birdsounds on CD and Dawn Chorus: A Sound Portrait of a British Woodland at Sunrise have surged over the past five days. Tweet of The Day is set to run for 265 episodes, with each one being accompanied by a short narration related to the different species. The five episodes so far have featured the Cuckoo, the Song Thrush, the Swift and the Wood Warbler. This morning (Fri) listeners heard the sound of the Nightingale. The series, which has been made by the BBCâs Natural History Unit, is being broadcast every weekday morning at 05.58am, just before the flagship current affairs show, the Today programme. Waterstoneâs spokesman Jon Howells, said yesterday: âItâs Spring and we traditionally see good sales of books about birds at this time. However, we have indeed noticed increased sales since Radio 4s Tweet of the Day started earlier this week â our top selling bird book, the RSPB Pocket Guide to British Birds is selling nearly twice as fast as last week. âCurrently, 11 of our top 20 natural history titles are bird books, which is about double what it would usually be. Tweet of the Day shows every sign of being one of those âout of nowhereâ things that sparks peopleâs interest and could indeed lead to lots more interest in birds, and bird books.â The retailer explained that the increase in sales were mostly restricted to physical copies of the books, rather than ebooks, as customers wanted to see the pictures and illustrations of the different birds. Birdsong: The nightingale (pictured) was one of the first birds to be featured on Tweet of the Day . Scripted by BBC presenter and wildlife expert Brett Westwood, each episode of Tweet of the Day features information about each particular birdâs behaviour and habits, as well as its literary and folklore associations. A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said last night: âThere is a real appetite for birdsong, and it is been a hugely popular topic among many of ourmembers in recent days, which may be a result of the Tweet of the Day feature on Radio 4. âThere appears to be a huge buzz around this and weâve noticed many more birdsong enquiries over the past few days.â Listeners have flooded social networking site Twitter to discuss the programme in recent days. Tom Colvin wrote: âLoving David Attenboroughâs Tweet of the Day. Perfect early morning radio.' Oliver Emanuel added: âThis is my new favourite thing.â Chris Wing said: âReally enjoying tweet of the day so far. I have been meaning to learn my birdsong for ages.â Toby Clark wrote: âCuckoo, song thrush, and now swift.

The programme comes four years after a cult radio station, which broadcast nothing but the sound of birdsong, was axed, prompting an outcry among fans. Birdsong Radio had attracted an estimated 500,000 listeners, including the author Sir Terry Pratchett. It played a 20 minute-long recording of birds singing in chorus, which was repeated on a continuous loop from 6am every day until midnight. However, it was cancelled in 2009 to make way for Amazing Radio, a station which plays a mix of indie, urban, rock and jazz music by unsigned artists. The decision caused outrage among its fans, who flooded forums and websites calling to have the programme reinstated.","BBC Radio 4 programme hosted by Attenborough hugely popular .

Companies are responding to the revelations in a variety of ways. Tech firms including Yahoo and Google are pushing back, adding . encryption, filing motions in the FISA court, and arguing that the NSA . is overstepping its bounds. But telecommunications firms appear to be cooperating fully.

'Therefore, because the proposal is . over-broad, it is excludable...' AT&T also argues that the issue of their disclosure practices . with the NSA has not been a topic of 'sustained debate over the last . several years,' a standard they say must be met to require public . reporting.

France and the African Union have announced plans to deploy several thousand more troops into the embattled Central African Republic. The move comes as thousands of Christians fearing reprisal attacks sought refuge from the Muslim former rebels who now control the country after days of violence left nearly 400 people â and possibly more â dead. Following a conference on African security in Paris, president Francois Hollande said France was raising its deployment to 1,600 today - 400 more than first announced. Francois Hollande, pictured here with Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chairwoman of the African Union Commission, it said France was raising its deployment to 1,600 today - 400 more than first announced . Later, after a meeting of regional . nations about the Central African Republic, his office said that African . Union nations agreed to increase their total deployment to 6,000 - up . from around 2,500 now, and nearly double the projected roll-out of 3,600 . by year-end. Amid new . massacres on Thursday, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution that . allows for a more muscular international effort to quell months of . unrest in the country. Troops . from France, the country's former colonial overseer, were patrolling . roads in Bangui and fanning out into the troubled north west on . Saturday. 'This force is going to . deploy as quickly as possible and everywhere there are risks for the . population, with the African forces that are present - currently 2,500 . soldiers,' Mr Hollande said, referring to the increased French presence. 'In what I believe will be a very short period we will be able to stop . all exactions and massacres.' In an interview with France-24 TV, Mr Hollande specified the AU reinforcements would arrive 'in the coming days'. Word of the bigger deployments came as human rights groups continued the grisly business of counting and collecting bodies of those killed in recent massacres. The death toll in the capital from the recent fighting rose on Saturday to 394, according to Antoine Mbao Bogo, of the local Red Cross. Meanwhile, Central African Republic's president called on the former rebels who are now integrated into the national army to stay off the streets now being patrolled by French and regional forces. Presidential spokesman Guy Simplice Kodegue said those who violated the order would be punished. Central African Republic, one of the world's poorest countries, has been wracked for decades by coups and rebellions. In March, the Muslim rebel alliance known as Seleka overthrew the Christian president of a decade. Aid workers returned to the streets today to collect bloated bodies that had been uncollected in the heat since Thursday, when Christian fighters known as the anti-balaka who oppose the country's ruler descended on the capital in a co-ordinated attack on several mostly Muslim neighbourhoods. Residents of Christian neighbourhoods said the ex-rebels known as Seleka later carried out reprisal attacks, going house-to-house in search of alleged combatants and firing at civilians who merely strayed into the wrong part of town. Zumbeti Thierry Tresor, 23, was among those killed after he tried to cross through another neighbourhood to visit family members in another part of Bangui. Seleka fighters shot him in the neck and stomach, his friends said. In March, the Muslim rebel alliance known as Seleka overthrew the Christian president of a decade .

The former actress had also wanted the Â£60million family villa but Mr Berlusconi, 77, whose personal fortune is estimated at Â£3.7billion, kept the villa near Milan as well as control of his business empire. The playboy politician has complained bitterly about the payments which add up to Â£82,000 a day or Â£30million a year stating that the 'ridiculous settlement' was a scandal, decided by three 'feminist and communist' judges. Miss Lario filed for divorce in 2009 after Berlusconi was photographed at an underwear model's 18th birthday party.

He was one of the most respected poets of the Second World War and a military hero, but he was also a serial deserter who lied about his war record. Vernon Scannell saw violence on the battlefield, but he took it back home, savagely beating the women in his life, according to revelations in a new biography. As a Desert Rat, who was seriously wounded in Normandy, and wrote of the 'heroic corpses' that he saw for himself on the D-Day beaches, he was no coward. Revelations: A new biography has revealed that wartime poet Vernon Scannell, pictured left as an old man and right as a soldier, was a serial deserter who lied about his war record . But the horrors of war took their toll on him. Now, seven years after his death aged 85, new research reveals that he absconded more than a dozen times, got into drunken brawls and physically abused his wife and two partners â apparently unaware of what he had done even on seeing the bruises he had inflicted on them. His desertions were known, but the full extent of them and the details have now been discovered by James Andrew Taylor, whose research will be published by Oxford University Press on October 24 in Walking Wounded: The Life And Poetry Of Vernon Scannell. The biography tells the story of a prize-winning and much-anthologised poet whose writings were 'drenched in humanity', as Professor John Carey puts it in the biographyâs foreword. Scannell was tormented by wartime memories of a soldierâs dying screams. In 1962, he wrote one of the most moving of war poems, Walking Wounded: 'â¦the walking wounded/Straggling the road like convicts loosely chained/Dragging at ankles exhaustion and despair/â¦' Scannell pictured with his former girlfriend Jo Peters. She recalled his nightmares in the new biography . Nor could he forget the shock of seeing fellow soldiers looting corpses, both British and German, stealing their watches and other valuables. Now Taylor has unearthed unpublished material from army records and other sources, and persuaded Scannellâs family to speak for the first time. Each of them told him of a tortured individual that they adored, somehow forgiving him for lashing out at them. Angela Beese, a long-term girlfriend, showed Taylor a diary entry in which she had cowered in fear: 'I think he might kill me, he is so angry.' But the next day, she wrote: 'I can see love once more in his eyes.' She also revealed the horror of being punched in the face by him - Scannell had learnt to punch as a boxer - but the next morning, he saw her two black eyes and a broken nose, but did not comment. His daughter, Nancy, says in the biography that her father never laid a finger on his children: 'But we were terrified for my mother. He was an aggressive drunk, destructive.' Taylor says that the descriptions of the violence against the women in his life are 'horrible'. Yet, the women saw another side to Scannell. Beese also told the biographer: 'Poetry was Vernonâs religionâ¦ Nothing, no human, mattered to him as much. Poetry was his wife, his mistress, his mother, his father.' Another former girlfriend, Jo Peters, recalls waking him from nightmares, sweating and shouting. Soldier: Scannell was a Desert Rat, who was seriously wounded in Normandy, and wrote of the 'heroic corpses' that he saw on the D-Day beaches . 'He remembered the first dead body he had seenâ¦ covered with a blanket, and all he could see was the hand,' she says. Taylor presented the evidence and symptoms to a leading psychiatrist who believes that Scannell would today be diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He said: 'Scannell, without doubt, was seriously damaged by the war - the jealous rages, the drunkenness, the violence, and the nightmares are all common enough symptoms of PTSD that is the forgotten legacy of combat for many thousands of old soldiers. It was the women he loved who suffered the bruises, the blood, and the tears - but it would be a harsh judge who ruled that Scannell himself was not a victim as well. The scars of war cut deep.' Scannell wrote several moving poems aboutÂ  El Alamein, including one conveying the heroism of a Scottish piper at the height of the battle: 'Of course that brave young piper/Did not stand there long/Shrapnel or a Spandau-burst/Ended that brief song.' 'But he wasnât there', Taylor says, having discovered that Scannell got to North Africa after El Alamein. Examples of the poet's writings. The new biography suggests that Scannell would today have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder . Scannell wrote several moving poems about El Alamein, including one conveying the heroism of a Scottish piper at the height of a battle - despite the fact that Scannell had not arrived in North Africa until after El Alamein . Notebooks belonging to poet Vernon Scannell, who was said to be 'tormented' by the horrors of war . Taylor discovered that Scannell spent more than 300 days on the run or in prison during four years of active war service from 1941. He found a record of a disciplinary hearing for having gone absent without leave - a hearing before Scannellâs commanding officer on 23 September, about a month after he would have had to set sail to reach North Africa in time for the battle of El Alamein. It proves that Scannell cannot possibly have been in Africa until four months later. Scannell did, however, take part in the bitter 1943 assault on Wadi Akarit. It was in the aftermath of that battle that he saw soldiers looting corpses. He walked away, only to be sentenced to three yearsâ military detention in a brutal military prison. He was released after six months when he volunteered to take part in the D-Day landings. When Germany surrendered, he disappeared again, living as a fugitive until finally rearrested in 1947. Scannellâs daughter, Jane, has yet to read the biography. But she says: 'As children, we were aware of the contradictions in our father - a warm, humorous, charismatic man who was a gentle, loving and fun father - and yet one whose behaviour towards our mother could be violent. 'Although we were only partially aware of his war-time experiences, even as children we felt the profound effect they had had on him. 'Neither his violence or the war were discussed in our homeâ¦ Howeverâ¦ the violence was only one very small aspect of Dad and one that did not define him to us - either as children or now. 'We hope Andrew's book will help explain what made him the man and poet he was.'","New biography reveals poet Vernon Scannell 'lied about his war record'

David Cameron said the international community had to to 'get right behind' the rebuilding of the war-torn country or risk fuelling terrorism and mass migration. After hosting an international conference in London, the Prime Minister warned radicalism was 'poisoning young Somali minds' which posed a threat to UK security. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured during today's Somalia conference in London, said the country could pose a security threat to the UK . The conference at Lancaster House brought together Somalia's president and a host of international leaders aimed to bring an end to two decades of conflict . Britain, China, the United States and South Africa are among the countries which have agreed to contribute to the Â£50 . million funding pot. The money will be used to build up the army, police force and strengthen maritime security.Mr Cameron said there had been 'remarkable' progress since the first meeting of world leaders last year but warned that 'huge challenges' remain. He told a press conference: 'If we ignore it we will be making the same mistakes in Somalia that we made in Afghanistan in the 1990s. I'm not prepared to let that happen.' In Mogadishu, demonstrators waved placards and photos of Mr Cameron and Somali president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud urging them to reach an international agreement . Home Secretary Theresa May and Foreign Secretary William Hague were among the senior ministers to attend the conference . Almost 50 governments and global bodies such as the IMF gathered at the conference to hear Somali president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud outline his plans to stabilise the country after two decades of brutal civil war. A year on from the last such meeting in London the world was 'seeing the beginnings of a new future for Somalia', Mr Cameron said. Extremism was 'in retreat' as the al Shabaab militias were driven from more towns, piracy attacks were down 80 per cent and a 'proper, legitimate' government had been put in place alongside a clan-selected parliament, he noted. The capital Mogadishu is starting to return to more normal life - with petrol stations, supermarkets and international flights returning for the first time since 1991 - despite continued terrorist attacks by extremists such as a suicide car bomb which killed several civilians last week. Ending poverty and the lure of payment by extremists was 'the best antidote to extremism', he said.But help had to go well beyond humanitarian aid, he said, pledging Â£10 million of UK support for developing Somalia's armed forces, Â£14.5 million to boost police numbers and train judges and financial support for a maritime radio system to counter piracy. 'I hope that others here will contribute too and the countries in the region will stay the course and work with Somalia while it builds up its own forces.' At present, it relies on the help of Ethiopian and African Union military support to combat al Shabaab. The PM said the international community had to send a 'strong signal' to world financial institutions to help Somalis deal with debt and get access to finance now it has a government recognised by the US and other key players for the first time in more than two decades. And al Shabaab extremists who renounced violence should be able to join the political process. Earlier Mr Cameron had talks with young members of the Somali diaspora and said he wanted to make their country sufficiently safe for those who wished to return and help with the rebuilding process.","London hosts international conference on ending two decades of conflict .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 04:44 EST, 17 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:08 EST, 17 October 2013 . A controversial Muslim free school is set to be placed in special measures after a damning official report condemned it as 'dysfunctional' and says that it is 'in chaos'. Al-Madinah, a free school in Derby, has repeatedly been featured in the Press for allegedly forcing women teachers to cover their hair and making boys and girls sit separately in class. Ofsted inspectors launched an urgent investigation into the school, and listed a number of serious criticisms in their official report, which was published this morning. David Cameron said he would be prepared to shut down the school if it does not improve quickly. A minister told MPs today that the school would not be allowed to 'languish in failure' and insisted the Government had taken 'swift action' to deal with the problem. Damning: Al-Madinah free school in Derby has been heavily criticised in an official Ofsted inspection report . The report found that teachers were inexperienced, with many having never taught before, and were overly generous in assessing pupils' work. It also wrote that boys and girls ate lunch in separate shifts, while older pupils were segregated by sex in the classroom. 'This school is dysfunctional,' the report stated. 'The basic systems and processes a school needs to operate well are not in place. The school is in chaos and reliant on the goodwill of an interim principal to prevent it totally collapsing.' It continued: 'This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience. 'Leadership and management, including governance, are inadequate and have been unable to improve the school.' Rules: A member of staff from the school, where female teachers were told to wear headscarves . Inspectors added: 'Staff have been . appointed to key roles for which they do not have qualifications and . experience. For example, most of the primary school teachers have not . taught before and the head of the primary school is experienced in . teaching secondary-aged pupils only.' Sir . Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, called for Al-Madinah to be placed in special measures in the report, which . rates the school as 'inadequate' in every category. Al-Madinah . opened in September 2012 as one of the free schools which are the . cornerstone of the Coalition Government's education policy, and has 412 pupils aged between four and 16. It . boasts of having 'a strong Muslim ethos', with long school days and . shorter holiday, which 'maximise opportunities for pupil achievement and . success'. The Ofsted inspection was brought forward . following reports that religious hardliners had taken control of the . school and imposed Islamic rules on all staff and pupils, including . non-Muslims. After the first day of the inspection, officials found so many worrying problems that they asked management to close down the school entirely while the investigation continued. According to the report, pupils in the secondary school 'are generally given the same work regardless of their ability', meaning that the most able students are not sufficiently stretched. Inspectors wrote that one hour-long maths lesson consisted almost entirely of pupils cutting out and pasting different shapes, while they said that the only subject which taught crucial literacy skills was Islamic Studies. The school's problem's mean that 'attendance is low and declining', the report said, leading to problems with 'behaviour and safety'. Acting headteacher Stuart Wilson accepted that the school has 'significant and serious problems' and that some lessons are not challenging pupils enough. 'Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody,' he told the BBC. 'We don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward.' He said today: 'Any school that faces special measures, as we clearly now do, has got its fair share of problems. I accept we have a whole range of problems. 'Some of those are things we can fix in the short term quite quickly. Some of them are longer-term in terms of the longer-term progress for students, teaching and learning etc.' Criticism: The report of the Ofsted inspection rated Al-Madinah as 'inadequate' on every criterion . When asked how parents have reacted . to the news, Dr Wilson said: 'In many ways the parents are aware more of . the reality of the school than the Press are. 'They . didn't have the concerns about the segregation. You'll notice in the . report that Ofsted said that there were no concerns about that. 'They . didn't have any concerns about the hijab. What they're seeing is the . school is on a journey. I think we're in a position now where we're not . where we want to be in terms of practicalities for the building. 'In . terms of having the right number of staff in place in key roles, that's . what we need to do now. We need key staff in key roles to allow the . school to move forward as quickly as possible.' Asked . whether he was concerned the school could face closure, he said: 'There . will need to be a school here for 412 children as of the end of last . month. 'There are . people on a daily basis who are doing a very difficult job very well. It's not something they signed up to when they came to the school to be a . member of staff here. 'We will do what's possible in the timescales that we're given. It's business as usual for our children.' 'Swift action': Schools minister David Laws told the House of Commons that the school's problems would be quickly tackled by the Government . The Prime Minister told the Derby Telegraph: 'I am not afraid to shut the school, of course. 'We are taking rapid corrective action towards the school. We are taking a tougher approach and schools will be shut.' He added: 'I am very disappointed all round by the Ofsted report and what is happening at the school, which is why we are acting swiftly.' Answering an urgent question in the . Commons today, schools minister David Laws said: 'After a steady start . by the school, we became aware of potential breaches of the conditions . in its funding agreement late this summer, and at the end of July we . began a wide-ranging investigation in to the financial management and . governance of the school. 'We . investigated whether the school was delivering on its requirement to be . inclusive and we investigated some allegations about the imposition of a . dress requirement on some members of staff. 'Our . investigations did indeed find significant and numerous breaches of the . conditions in its funding agreement and our concerns were such that we . requested Ofsted to bring forward its planned inspection.' Closed: The school was temporarily shut down during the urgent Ofsted investigation . He . added: 'The Ofsted report is published this morning. It has found the . school is dysfunctional and is inadequate across every category of . inspection . 'We will not let any school, whether a free school, an academy school or a local authority school, languish in failure. 'The . Ofsted report confirms we are taking the right actions. We are not . prepared to let a school fail its parents, its children and its . community. We said we would take swift action in these cases and that is . exactly what we are doing.' Shadow education secretary Tristram . Hunt said Michael Gove's free schools agenda was 'out of control', . adding that the policy had been dealt a 'devastating blow' by the . revelations in Derby. 'The . Education Secretary has sacrificed learning for ideology,' he told MPs. 'It is not just Al-Madinah school which is dysfunctional, it is the . Education Secretary's free schools policy.' As . the report was published, the Department for Education released a . letter sent to chairman of governors Shazia Parveen by schools minister . Lord Nash, in which he says that Ofsted's report confirms the 'very . serious concerns' he raised in a previous letter to the school. 'The report is further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address,' he writes. 'Contrary . to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more . convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of . the Trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious . failings at the school.' Clash: Al-Madinah is one of the free schools championed by Education Secretary Michael Gove, left; his Labour opposite number Tristram Hunt, right, says that it shows the policy has failed . The local MP, Chris Williamson, has called for the school to be closed down completely following the litany of complaints. 'Frankly, . the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully . expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative . places in the council schools in the city,' he told the BBC. Mr Hunt told the Guardian that the school's problems show that the Coalition's education reforms have failed. 'What . this report exposes is that David Cameron and Michael Gove's free . school programme has become a dangerous free-for-all - an out of control . ideological experiment that has closed a school, leaving 400 children . losing an entire week of learning,' he said. 'Pupils . have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to . know how David Cameron and Michael Gove have allowed this to happen - . especially as Ofsted identified that this school was not meeting the . basic requirements on child protection before it was opened. 'Far . from an isolated incident, the failings at this school reveal the . systemic threat to education standards under this Government. David . Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a . crisis entirely of their own making.' A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. 'We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence.' Derby City Council said it acknowledged the findings of the Ofsted report. A statement said: 'Educational attainment for all children and young people in Derby is as always our priority. The council is keen to work with other agencies as partners to address the key issues outlined in the Ofsted report.'","Al-Madinah school in Derby was closed for Ofsted inspection after reports that bosses segregated students and made staff cover their heads .

A little girl can never have a cuddle from her mother because a rare condition means she breaks out in painful sores at the slightest touch. Alisa Doanvan, five, is at risk of a potentially deadly infection because of the disorder but still attends school despite not being able to join in many playground games. Just one cuddle from her mother, Lee, 33, can leave Alisa with painful sores and walking barefoot can see her skin flare up. Alisa Doanvan (pictured with her parents, Joe and Lee) has a rare skin condition which means her skin blisters and develops painful sores at the slightest touch . Alisa suffers from Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (EB) which affects less than one child in a million. Her mother, from Dartford, Kent, said: âItâs awful seeing Alisa in so much pain, we have to be so careful with her, even a simple cuddle is impossible as she sometimes has blisters on her back. âDespite having such a painful condition she never moans and still tries to do everything like a normal little girl. âAlisaâs condition means she has scabs and sores all over her body and is unable to do some things as its too dangerous - such as playing with her friends in the playground. âAlisa currently has no skin on her left knee so sheâs unable to straighten it.â Alisa is forced to run on the balls of her feet as her toes have started to fuse together where the skin has shed and healed so many times - she will need an operation to separate them. Alisa's body is covered in painful sores and she has to use a wheelchair as the blisters make it too painful for her to walk far . Alisa suffers from Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (EB) which affects less than one child in a million . Blisters also form easily inside her mouth so she has to stick to a soft food diet. She canât physically eat enough calories each day to aid her constantly healing body, so she is fed via a gastrostomy button in her tummy during the night. Her mother is her full time carer and faces the gruelling task of changing her bandages every day - it takes an hour and a half and is very painful. She said: âAlisa will try and do as much as she can but easy movements are often painful for Alisa. âEven walking is painful - her skin shears away and causes blisters - sitting down is equally bad.â Alisa's mother said: 'It's awful seeing Alisa in so much pain, we have to be so careful with her, even a simple cuddle is impossible as she sometimes has blisters on her back' Alisa is forced to run on the balls of her feet as her toes have started to fuse together where the skin has shed and healed so many times - she will need an operation to separate them . When Alisa was born, the youngest of four sisters, her parents Joe and Lee knew immediately there was something wrong with her angry, pink skin. Alisa was diagnosed only a few days after birth - and she was suffering from the most severe type of EB - it can be fatal in infancy but luckily a better prognosis followed. Her mother said: âHer skin was so sore when she was first born - we had no idea what was wrong with Alisa or how serious her condition was - thankfully her skin condition slightly improved and we were able to take her home.â Her father, Joe, 43, said: âWe have to be very careful around Alisa as even cuddling her can cause severe blisters and can completely tear the skin off.â The Doanvan family are supported by the Debra charity - they have specialist EB nurses who have assisted them from the moment Alisa was born. Alisa uses a wheelchair at school to give her independence, allowing her to move safely around. Alisa's father, Joe, 43, said: âWe have to be very . careful around Alisa as even cuddling her can cause severe blisters and . can completely tear the skin offâ Ben Merrett, Debra Chief Executive said: âImagine a baby in terrible pain. Think about a parent having endless rounds of changing dressings, lancing blisters and cleaning the open wounds that develop all over their childâs body. âThis is the reality faced by many families affected by EB who often lose their child after years of fighting this devastating condition. âDebra is the only national organisation which offers specialist care and support to people and families affected by the condition and provides real hope for the future by funding pioneering research to find effective treatments for EB.â Junctional epidermolysis bullosa is one of the forms of epidermolysis bullosa - a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be fragile and easily damaged. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa is divided into two main types - Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa and non-Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa. The features of each type are similar but Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa is more severe. From birth affected children have blistering over large parts of their bodies. They also experience blistering in their mouth and digestive tract which can make eating difficult. The sores make affected children susceptible to severe infections. The condition can also cause breathing difficulties if it impacts the airways, and fusion of the fingers and toes. It can also cause restricted movement and hair loss. Infants with the condition usually do not survive beyond their first year. Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa affects less than one child per million.","Alisa Doanvan has Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa which causes her skin to break out in painful sores when it is touched .

The guns that have caused so many deaths and wrecked thousands of lives in northern Mexico are now making music. Sculptor Pedro Reyes has taken hundreds of guns seized in Ciudad Juarez in Mexico and transformed them into artistic musical instruments. He has cut down gun barrels to different lengths to sound like marimbas while other pistol parts have been turned into cymbals. Top gun: Mexican sculptor Pedro Reyes pictured next to an instrument made out of used weapons that mimics the sound of a bass guitar . Top gun: Pedro Reyes picked out the weapons he wanted to use in the project out of 6,700 guns that were seized . Reyes said: 'It's important to consider that many lives were taken with these weapons, as if a sort of exorcism was taking place.' When they were played, he said, 'the music expelled the demons they held, as well as being a requiem for lives lost.' For the project titled 'Disarm', Reyes said he was able to choose his instruments from about 6,700 guns that were turned in or seized by the army and police in Ciudad Juarez, a city of about 1.3 million people where 10 people were shot a day at the height of the violence. In 2010, Ciudad Juarez had a murder rate of 230 killings to every 100,000 inhabitants. The nationwide rate for the U.S. that year was 4.8. Hooting sounds: Former rifles, seized by the army and police in Ciudad Juarez, have been transformed into a rustic piano . Invention: Reyes made this circular xylophone just using the parts of old guns . Reyes said: 'The dramatic thing is that this is just the tip of the iceberg of all the weapons that are seized every day and that the army has to destroy.' Reyes has used weapons in his previous artworks. In 2008, he melted down 1,527 weapons to make the same number of shovels to plant the same number of trees. This latest project began last year with a phone call offering him another chance to work with the seized guns. 'Normally, they bury or destroy them, but someone who works in the government said, ""Would you be interested in making a sculpture with this metal?"".' Drug-cartel violence cost more than 70,000 lives in Mexico over the last six years with many of the weapons used by the cartels smuggled across the border from the United States. Transformation: Pedro Reyes tests a drum-like set made out of gun parts at his workshop in Mexico City . Disarming: Reyes described playing the instruments as an 'exorcism' of their violent past . In 2012, then-president Felipe Calderon inaugurated a billboard in Ciudad Juarez which, facing Texas, spelled out the words 'No More Weapons' in welded pieces of decommissioned guns. Reyes also hopes to take his message international, with an exhibition of the musical instruments in London's Lisson Gallery in March and later in the United States. 'This project has a pacifist intent, to create a global consciousness about arms trafficking,' Reyes said. Violence has become a theme in Mexican art in recent years. One artist from the violence-plagued state of Sinaloa, Teresa Margolles, works with artifacts collected from crime scenes, such as pieces of glass or cloth dabbed with mud and blood. Reyes stresses that his work 'is not just a protest, but a proposal'. 'It occurred to me to make musical instruments, because music is the opposite of weapons,' Reyes said. 'This exercise of transformation we see with the guns, is what we would like to see in society.' A loaded task: Reyes has dedicated his last two years transforming weapons used to kill into works of art . Checking the load: A worker organises a set of seized guns in the workshop of Mexican sculptor Pedro Reyes .

"By . Neil Ashton  and Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 02:53 EST, 17 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:10 EST, 17 October 2013 . England manager Roy Hodgson has been forced to make a bizarre apology after making a joke about a monkey while referring to a mixed-race player during a half-time team talk. The coach's gaffe is believed to have upset a player in the dressing room during England's 2-0 win over Poland at Wembley on Tuesday night which secured the team's place in the next World Cup. Hodgson made the joke, which refers to the early days of Nasa space missions, as he was telling defender Chris Smalling that he should pass the ball to midfielder Andros Townsend - both players are mixed-race. Several prominent footballers have come forward to defend the manager, but anti-racism campaigners have demanded that the FA launch an investigation to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. Good man: Hodgson is being tarnished by over-zealous reactions from activists . Star: The remark came as Hodgson urged players to pass to up-and-coming star Andros Townsend . He told players: 'Nasa decides to send a shuttle into space with two monkeys and an astronaut on board. 'After . months of training, they put all three in the shuttle and prepare for . launch. Mission control announces: ""This is mission control to Monkey . One. Do your stuff."" The first monkey begins frantically typing and the . shuttle takes off. We're there: Roy Hodgson and Andros Townsend embrace following the final whistle in the qualifier that secured England's place at the 2014 World Cup . 'Two . hours later, mission control centre announces: ""This is mission control . to Monkey Two. Do your stuff."" The second monkey starts typing like mad . and the shuttle separates from its empty fuel tanks. 'After another two hours mission control announces: ""This is mission control to astronaut..."" 'The astronaut interrupts, shouting: 'I know, I know - feed the monkeys and don't touch anything!""' The FA confirmed that Hodgson did . make the remarks, but said they were disappointed that it has been interpreted by . some as a racial slur or innuendo. Hodgson said last night: âI would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. âThere was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. âI made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. âHe has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.â The . coach is said to be furious, and . insists the joke refers only to a fictional event and cannot be . interpreted as having any racial connotations, despite the historic use . of 'monkey' as a racist term for black people. A video still of Townsend emerging from the tunnel for the second half against Poland, following Roy Hodgson's gaffe at half time . Unfazed: Townsend has taken to Twitter today to questioned what all the fuss was about and say that no offence was taken . Game: Townsend leaves the pitch after being substituted, walking past Hodgson on the way . Nasa decides to send a shuttle into space with two monkeys and an astronaut on board. After months of training, they put all three in the shuttle and prepare for launch. Mission control announces: 'This is mission control to Monkey One. Do your stuff.' The first monkey begins frantically typing and the shuttle takes off. Two hours later, mission control centre announces: 'This is mission control to Monkey Two. Do your stuff.' The second monkey starts typing like mad and the shuttle separates from its empty fuel tanks. After another two hours mission control announces: 'This is mission control to astronaut...' The astronaut interrupts, shouting: 'I know, I know - feed the monkeys and don't touch anything!' Townsend, a promising 22-year-old . winger for Tottenham Hotspur, told the FA he was not offended by the . joke when officials spoke to him about the incident. He tweeted today: 'I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even newsworthy!' His father Troy works for the anti-racism campaign Kick It Out, and is believed to have discussed the issue with his son. A spokesman for Kick It Out said that . the organisation 'recognises and shares the concerns of the parties who . felt mindful to bring the comments into the public domain.' He . added: 'The matter has been raised by the Chair directly with the FA, . who acknowledges the apology made by Roy Hodgson and now seeks an . investigation to ascertain the full facts and ensure a similar situation . does not arise again.' Controversy: The joke was made to Manchester United's right-back Chris Smalling . 'All . the FA has to do is examine the facts and make a statement. If they do . not then there will be recriminations from other players.' Piara Powar, executive director of . European anti-discrimination group FARE, said: 'Hodgson used a very . silly term within a diverse team environment. He should know better.' Hodgson is understood to be distraught . by any attempt to smear his name after successfully leading England to next year's World Cup finals in Brazil on Tuesday. The 66-year-old manager is known for his lengthy team talks, but the decision to tell a joke at half-time is unusual. Some football fans expressed outrage at the alleged racial jibe - Adekunle Dimeji tweeted: 'Roy Hodgson should be sacked.' Clash: The joke came in a half-time team talk during the crunch game at Wembley Stadium . However, . others stood up for him and insisted he meant no harm by the remark, . such as Bryn Jones who wrote: 'If you think Roy Hodgson's ""feed the . monkey"" remark was racist, then you didn't get the joke.' Former footballer Stan Collymore, who . played for Liverpool and Aston Villa as well as appearing three times . for England, took to Twitter to defend the manager, claiming that the . supposed scandal detracts from anti-racism efforts. 'Demeans . every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH who said NOTHING . WRONG,' he wrote. 'Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're . not.' Legendary striker . John Barnes, who was often subjected to racial abuse during his playing . career, said: âHow can anybody be offended by that? Itâs not racist.' England's Wayne Rooney added: 'Seen the story on Roy this morning. He [sic] done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.' Ridiculous: That Roy Hodgson is being smeared as a racist by politically correct thought police is ludicrous . The row has taken the gloss off . Englandâs qualification, which was praised by David Cameron in Parliament yesterday, and came as it was revealed that Hodgson is in . line for a huge bonus after leading England to Brazil. If he is successful next summer, the . cash reward he will receive could reach Â£1million. Hodgson . accepted a basic package worth Â£3million a year when he left West Bromwich Albion to take over the England team after the previous manager Fabio Capello resigned ahead of last year's Euro 2012 tournament. He has previously spoken out against racism in football, saying that racial prejudice is 'abhorrent'.","Hodgson told joke about Nasa sending a monkey into space .
