"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- It is expected to be a court date like no other, with Spaniards riveted to a financial corruption case that involves members of the royal family. On Saturday, Princess Cristina, the youngest daughter of King Juan Carlos, will be the first direct member of Spain's royal family to testify in court while facing preliminary charges for a crime, Spain's royal household has confirmed. Her husband, Inaki Urdgangarin, faces preliminary charges in the same matter and already testified, a year ago. The case centers on his nonprofit Noos foundation that received millions of dollars in government contracts to stage sports and tourism events. Judge Jose Castro is investigating whether part of that money was diverted for private use by the princess, who is 48, and her husband, 46. Through their legal teams, both deny any wrongdoing. The closed-door testimony for the princess will be held at a local court in Palma de Mallorca in the Balearic Islands. The courthouse is not far from the Marivent Palace, the royal family's summer residence on Mallorca, one of Europe's top tourist destinations. Judge Castro last April leveled preliminary charges against the princess in this case, but they were dropped in May after prosecutors appealed to a provincial court, citing insufficient evidence. But Castro continued his investigation and last month issued a 227-page order, again bringing preliminary charges against the princess, for alleged tax fraud and money laundering through a separate company, Aizoon, in which she had a 50% stake, with her husband holding the rest. ""They used that company to pocket the public money and also to pay the lowest possible tax or simply cheat the Treasury,"" said Eduardo Inda, investigations editor at El Mundo newspaper who co-authored a book, ""Urdangarin,"" about the alleged financial improprieties. ""In that company, Princess Cristina is the one who signs the annual reports,"" Inda said. When the new preliminary charges were filed in January, Cristina's top lawyer, veteran politician and defense attorney Miquel Roca, told reporters they would appeal. But a week later, there was a sudden change of position, and it was announced that the princess would testify. The about-face was not due to pressure from the royal household, but instead was a personal decision by the princess, who persuaded her defense team on the issue, said an official familiar with discussions within the royal household, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""It was her decision to testify, simply because she has nothing to hide, and she's convinced the preliminary charges could be dropped, and it's better to testify than let the idea of cowardice be out there,"" the official said. The preliminary charges eventually could be dropped, but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion. The case is one of various financial corruption scandals affecting the royal family and major political parties and a leading union, during the economic crisis, when many Spaniards have lost jobs or had to tighten their financial belts. Princess Cristina's testimony comes as a new report by the European Commission shows that 95% of Spaniards say that corruption is widespread in the nation. The royal household two years ago excluded Princess Cristina and her husband from representing Spain at official functions, like one this week in Madrid, when the King, Queen Sofia, Crown Prince Felipe and his wife, Princess Letizia, welcomed the foreign diplomatic corps. But some Spaniards say the princess is still getting special treatment. ""It's great they're finally bringing preliminary charges,"" said student Mariana Moragrega, outside the royal palace in Madrid. ""But considering she's the King's daughter, she'll be very protected, and won't go to jail."" A columnist for El Pais newspaper, Ernesto Ekaizer, predicts the testimony on Saturday could be the beginning of the end of the case against the princess. He writes that the judge again faces opposition from a prosecutor who says there's still insufficient criminal evidence against the princess. And that the case may be dropped before reaching trial. Carlos Cruzado, president of the Gesta union of tax agency technicians who work at the Treasury Ministry, said it's unusual for a prosecutor to seemingly side with the princess, who's facing preliminary charges of tax fraud, instead of standing up for the interests of the nation's tax collection agency.","Princess Cristina of Spain to testify Saturday .

"Hong Kong, China (CNN)  -- Hong Kong urged its residents to cut short or cancel planned trips to the Philippines on Tuesday in the aftermath of a bloodbath that left eight dead on a Manila tour bus. Hong Kong's regional government issued its highest level of travel warnings in the aftermath of the killings, urging all residents to avoid traveling to the Philippines. ""Those already there should attend to their personal safety and stay alert,"" the advisory read. Tour groups were urged to return ""as soon as possible,"" while other groups scheduled to visit were urged to cancel their trips. Manila police said Rolando Mendoza, a former police officer upset at having lost his job, took hostage a busload of tourists from Hong Kong Monday and killed eight of them before being shot dead. One passenger was critically wounded and six others hospitalized with less serious injuries after the 10-hour standoff erupted into gunfire, Donald Tsang, the chief executive of Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government, told reporters. And in Beijing, the Chinese government said Tuesday it ""severely condemns the atrocious behavior of the criminal"" and expressed its ""deep sorrow"" and ""sincerely condolences"" to the families of the victims. ""The Chinese government has already decided to send working teams to the Philippines and we will keep close contact with both the Philippine as well as Hong Kong government, putting our best effort into rescuing the injured parties in the aftermath,"" China's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement on the killings. China has asked the Philippine government ""to take concrete action to secure [and] guarantee the protection and safety of Chinese lives and wealth."" The incident began at 10 a.m. Monday (10 p.m. ET Sunday), when Mendoza -- wearing a uniform and carrying a rifle -- flagged down the tourist bus and asked for a ride, police spokesman Erwin Margarejo told reporters. A tour guide for Hong Thai Travel tried to stop him from boarding the bus, the company's general manager told reporters. ""The gunman said he wanted to have a free lift. Then the tour guide stopped him,"" General Manager Susanna Lau said. ""Eventually, the gunman got on the coach and then asked the driver to lock the door."" Lau said the gunman did not threaten people on the bus. Twenty-five people, including 22 foreigners, were on the bus when Mendoza boarded it, Manila District Police Chief Rodolfo Magtibay said. Mendoza wrote his demand that he get his job back on a board and displayed it in the bus windshield. Inside, the hostages appeared calm but confused, Margarejo said. Police cordoned off the area around the bus as they tried to negotiate, and sharpshooters were stationed nearby. Food was delivered to the hostages on board. Manila police official Leocadio Santiago told CNN that Mendoza's family members spoke with him early in the standoff and that he appeared ""very reasonable and very psychologically stable."" The gunman released nine of the hostages, including a mother and her three children, a man with diabetes, and two photographers. The bus driver also escaped. Around 2 p.m., the Philippine news channel ANC showed images of signs posted on the bus windshield saying, ""Big deal will start after 3 p.m. today"" and ""3 p.m. today dead lock."" But two hours later, there were no signs that the situation had changed. ANC showed passengers peeking out from behind curtains of the parked bus and a sign posted on the bus door saying, ""Big mistake to correct a big wrong decision."" Mendoza was dismissed a year ago, Margarejo said. Manila Vice Mayor Ikso Moreno told CNNI that Mendoza's dismissal was for extortion and that he wanted his motion for reconsideration to be heard. ""He felt that it was being neglected,"" Moreno said. ""So he went on hostaging a bus full of foreign individuals. So when we talked to him this afternoon, that's what he wanted."" Moreno said that Mendoza's brother was arrested because he was ""guilty of conspiring with his brother"" and allegedly helped instigate the shooting. Moreno said when he arrived near the site of the standoff in the company of Mendoza's brother and the chief hostage negotiator, ""All of a sudden, he kept on shouting, 'Don't let go until they give my gun back! Don't let go! Don't let go!' He just shout, one moment -- Captain Mendoza just fired his gun."" Mendoza sprayed machine gun fire at the hostages, a police spokesman told CNN. At 8 p.m. Monday, police stormed the bus, which held 15 hostages, killing Mendoza. In Manila, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III said he had ordered an investigation, and would wait until it is completed before deciding whether anyone should lose his or her job. ""As the president, my opinion might already sway the investigative panel, which might hamper them in ferreting out the truth, so I will not do that at this time,"" he said. Aquino said the news media may have worsened the situation by giving the shooter ""a bird's-eye view of the entire situation,"" but said he had little choice but to let it play out the way it did. ""If we ordered a news blackout, you would tell us we were guilty of censoring news,"" he said. ""We did vow transparency.""

"(CNN) -- Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people around the world -- and many of their allies -- are protesting the Winter Olympics in Sochi because of Russia's anti-gay law, which basically criminalizes pro-gay speech or propaganda. As a lesbian, and yes, one who has been known from time to time to propagandize (i.e., write and talk) about how gay people are equal in every sense imaginable to straight folks -- and should be treated as such -- I feel the Russian law is unthinkably inhumane and offensive. And as far as I'm concerned, it's a reason to boycott the Sochi games and ostracize Russia on the world stage in general. And so you can imagine my surprise in discovering that the Sochi Games have featured moments filled with gay symbolism. And we're only a few days in. 5. The pretend lesbians who sang and held hands at Opening Ceremony . The Russian band t.A.T.u. made waves several years ago when they skyrocketed to fame as a young-Russian-lesbians-in-love pop duo followed by the revelation that the stars of the band were actually heterosexual and merely staged the gay thing to get attention. Nonetheless, t.A.T.u.'s Yulia Volkova and Lena Katina achieved pseudo-gay icon status in Russia and beyond. So it was a big deal when they performed at the Sochi opening ceremony and held hands, hopefully a subtle form of protest causing Russian President Vladimir Putin to clutch his pearls. Hopefully. 4. IOC chairman's speech about tolerance and diversity . Thomas Bach, the chairman of the International Olympic Committee, gave a speech at the opening ceremonies, as such chairpeople usually do. If you watched the speech on NBC, you might have missed the most important part, which NBC claims it edited out because of time, not politics. In the cut portion, Bach says: . ""This is the Olympic message the athletes spread to the host country and to the whole world. Yes, it is possible to strive even for the greatest victory with respect for the dignity of your competitors. Yes, yes, it is possible -- even as competitors -- to live together under one roof in harmony, with tolerance and without any form of discrimination for whatever reason. Yes, it is possible -- even as competitors -- to listen, to understand and to give an example for a peaceful society."" Intentional or not, it was a mistake for NBC to edit out that very important part. This political point needed making. 3. The Canadian bobsled team posted what? Four men. With beards. And rippling muscles. Wearing nothing but their underwear. Crammed into a phallic-shaped bobsled to pose for a photo. I mean. For the record (and for my lawyer), I'm not saying the Canadian Bobsled team is gay. I am saying this picture is. 2. Blake Skjellerup's one blade crusade . New Zealand's speed skater Skjellerup is one of a handful of openly gay athletes competing in Sochi. Skjellerup was able to afford to go to the Olympics thanks to fundraising support from the gay community worldwide and now that he's there, he's working extra hard to represent. He's got his own pin. And this week, Skjellerup won the Internet with this tweet: . Here's hoping Blake gets the chance. I'm leaving out the uniforms and gloves that, apparently coincidentally, feature the rainbow colors used to signify gay pride around the world, the campiness of figure skating uniforms -- the idea of de-gayed figure skating is so laughable that 'Saturday Night Live"" parodied the idea in its pre-Sochi cold open imagining ""Heterosexual Figure Skating Championships"" -- and the all-male choir in uniforms that could belong to the Village People singing about getting lucky. But this one is priceless. Because there's only so much fabulousness you can fit in one essay, and I simply had to make room for this. 1. Thank you, Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion . This didn't happen at Sochi but is sure inspired by it and is by far the most awesome thing ever so I'm including it here. The Canadians put out this video as a giant homoerotic rebuttal to Putin and discrimination in Russia. It is a wonder to behold. Watch the clip. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Sally Kohn: The Olympic Games at Sochi have been pretty flamboyant so far .

"(CNN) -- Authorities evacuated a small town in northern Iowa and waited out a fire at an agricultural chemical company Thursday after warning that the blaze involved sulfuric acid. At least four people complained of breathing problems as a plume of smoke rose over the town of Northwood, near the Minnesota state line, said Sgt. Scott Bright, a spokesman for the Iowa Highway Patrol. Officials in Worth County ordered Northwood's roughly 2,000 residents to leave town, sending them to towns to the south until an all-clear was given Thursday afternoon. Bright said that the facility where the fire broke out houses chemicals used for crop dusting and that some of those chemicals were believed to contain sulfuric acid. Firefighters decided to let the blaze burn itself out, and the column of smoke it put out wasn't expected to affect neighboring communities, he said. During the evacuation, buses brought Northwood residents to a community center in Kensett, about six miles down U.S. Highway 65. But the facility was ""by no means overwhelmed,"" said Don Preston, pastor of Bethel United Methodist Church in nearby Manly. ""The facility is sort of breathing people in and out,"" Preston said. ""They get off the buses, and a lot of people, especially the longtime residents, have family and friends nearby, and they come and pick them up."" Northwood City Clerk Amber Julseth said that about 230 people had been staying at the community center early Thursday afternoon, and ""everyone is OK."" The evacuation orders were lifted by midafternoon, said Lori McNalley, the city clerk in Kensett. An April fire at a fertilizer company in West, Texas, killed 15 people -- mostly firefighters and paramedics -- when a stock of volatile ammonium nitrate detonated. The blast showed up on seismographs and flattened much of the small town south of Dallas. CNN's Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.","NEW: The evacuation order has been lifted for Northwood, Iowa, official says .

"(CNN) -- A registered sex offender was charged Wednesday with rape and murder in connection with the disappearance of a California girl. John Albert Gardner III, 30, pleaded not guilty to all charges, which stem from last week's disappearance of Chelsea King, 17, of the San Diego, California, area. The charges against Gardner make him eligible for the death penalty, the San Diego County district attorney's office said Wednesday. The office said it has not yet determined whether it will seek capital punishment. Gardner, of Lake Elsinore, California, will not be allowed to post bail. Gardner was also charged Wednesday with assault with intent to commit rape in connection with an attack on a jogger in December 2009. Searchers found a body Tuesday that they believe to be King's. Police arrested Gardner on Sunday. Gardner is a registered sex offender, according to Steve Walker, a spokesman for the San Diego County district attorney. King has been missing since February 25. Investigators say she was last seen at her school in Poway, about 15 miles north of San Diego. Her car, with her cell phone inside, was found at Rancho Bernardo Community Park. On Tuesday, searchers found remains in a shallow grave at that park; they were found along the shoreline of a tributary south of a lake, authorities said. ""There is strong likelihood that we have found Chelsea,"" San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said at a news conference Tuesday. He said he expected a positive identification of the body to come Wednesday. Follow local coverage on KGTV . The body was found in a heavily wooded area not visible from nearby homes. A shoe had been found earlier in the same area, the sheriff said. ""Now that we have filed charges, our primary focus is obtaining justice for Chelsea King and her family,"" San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie M. Dumanis said Wednesday. ""I also want to acknowledge the dedication of all the volunteers who helped in the search for Chelsea."" Police said Wednesday that the garage door of the home of Gardner's mother was spray-painted with a message saying that King's blood is on her hands. ""Chelseas (sic) blood is on you move out,"" the message said, according to San Diego police spokesman Gary Hassen. Gardner's next court appearance, a status hearing, is scheduled for Tuesday. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 18.","John Albert Gardner III accused of raping, killing teen who disappeared last week .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Deadly bombings in two London parks on July 20, 1982 represented a dark day in the bloody conflict between Irish republicans and the British government -- now their legacy threatens to derail Northern Ireland's hard-fought peace process. Eleven British soldiers -- some members of Queen Elizabeth II's Household Cavalry regiment, others part of a military band -- died during blasts in Hyde Park and Regent's Park. One of the men accused of being behind the Hyde Park attack -- believed to have been carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) -- walked free this week after it emerged in court that he had a letter from the British government from 2007 -- the 25th anniversary of the bombings -- assuring him he did not face prosecution for IRA crimes. Prosecutors argued the letter was sent ""in error"" to John Anthony Downey, 62, and that authorities at the time had failed to register an outstanding warrant for his arrest in connection with the 1982 attack. Downey, who denies planting the bomb that killed four of the soldiers, was not the only one to be given immunity. Almost 200 other Irish republican terror suspects were too. Covert deal . According to British media, 187 so-called ""comfort letters"" were sent to suspected IRA terrorists such as Downey -- known as ""on the runs"" -- who sought clarification about their status after a peace settlement in 1998, known as the Good Friday Agreement, which brought the decades-long ""troubles"" in Northern Ireland to an end. The letters were part of a covert deal struck between the British government and republicans -- who bitterly opposed British rule -- to ease the reconciliation process. Now the historic power-sharing government in Northern Ireland -- which brought unionists and republicans together -- appears in grave danger of collapsing. The top lawmaker in the administration, First Minister Peter Robinson, said it had been plunged into crisis over the deal allowing suspected terrorists to walk free. Robinson has threatened to resign, saying he had been kept in the dark over the years about the secret ""letters of assurance."" He said he only found out after the London court judgment. And he's supposed to be in charge here. His partner in government, Martin McGuinness -- himself a former IRA commander -- urged him to pull back from the brink of bringing down the government. The nationalist Sinn Fein leader took to social media to say: ""My unionist colleagues need to calm down. We've all come a long way. No sensible person will thank anyone for threatening the institutions."" British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, stressed the British government ""does not support amnesties for people wanted by the police in connection with terrorist offenses,"" and that Downey ""was part of an administrative scheme for dealing with 'on-the-runs' set up by the previous government."" She added that the government would be working with the police to identify whether there are other cases similar to that of Downey. Imperfect peace . The tension is a sign of the times in Northern Ireland. There's peace but an imperfect one. The bombings and sectarian murders have largely stopped, although small groupings of IRA dissidents continue to pose a threat. Pro-British paramilitary groups also remain active. Emotions continue to run high between the pro-British and pro-Irish communities over issues such as parades and the flying of the British Union flag. The parades are particularly controversial -- groups from both sides of the unionist/nationalist divide would claim they hold marches as a celebration of their culture, while critics would argue they are asserting their rights over communities across Northern Ireland. American diplomat Richard N. Haass was flown into Belfast to chair all-party talks last year in a bid to find a resolution to outstanding issues -- the talks ended without agreement. Marching season . Through it all, the power-sharing administration at Stormont -- Northern Ireland's Parliament Buildings -- in Belfast has held. The present-day political and economic challenges were being worked through. But the past has proved more difficult to deal with. And with elections on the horizon, compromise might not be viewed as a policy to win votes. Another controversial summer marching season looms with the prospect of violent clashes at disputed locations. The trouble tends to be confined to certain neighborhoods, mainly working class districts of Belfast. But the shockwaves can be felt across Northern Ireland. IRA dissidents lurk in the background desperate to launch attacks. Many victims of decades of paramilitary violence believe their voices are being ignored. Of course, there are many economic challenges too, with a sluggish economy and an unemployment rate above the UK average. It promises to be an interesting year in Northern Ireland. And while the politicians fight, the vast majority of people on both sides of the religious divide are united -- praying for peace.","1982 IRA bomb attacks on two London parks killed 11 British soldiers .

"(CNN) -- Tracey Madigan was looking forward to watching hockey games at the Olympics with her three kids this year. Now, she's scrambling to cancel their plane tickets because Sochi just doesn't seem safe. Growing security concerns surrounding the Games, she says, made her rethink the family vacation plans she made months ago. ""We wanted to do it to be a cultural learning experience for the kids,"" she says, ""and now that's not worth the risk."" It's a worry many people are weighing as warnings about the possibility of terrorists targeting the Sochi games grew this week. Athletes say they're still eager to compete in the Games, which are less than three weeks away. Organizers say they're confident officials have a handle on the situation. And Russia's leaders say they've stepped up security around the area in a ""Ring of Steel"" that attackers won't penetrate. But those reassurances haven't stopped serious concerns about safety among spectators, competitors and security analysts. Warnings fuel travel fears . After decades of hearing about the Olympics from afar as her husband helped cover them for a French-Canadian television network, Madigan decided this was the year for the family to fly from Washington, D.C., to Sochi and join him. She started worrying when she learned about last month's terrorist attacks in Volgograd, Russia, which killed more than 30 people, but she tried to tamp down her concerns. A U.S. State Department travel alert earlier this month convinced her that the situation was serious. The wording of the alert, which calls large-scale public events like the Olympics ""an attractive target for terrorists,"" and mentions previous attacks in Russia was strong enough to make Madigan decide to back out. ""It's an official voice telling you that yes, your fears are right. ... OK, it's not just me. There's another voice, a voice with some gravitas saying, 'Be careful out there.'"" And the potential security threats seem to be mounting, Madigan said. ""It hasn't stopped,"" she said. ""Over the past couple of days, it's continuing."" So while news reports surged this week about new threats to the games, a wanted terror suspect on the loose and warships readying to evacuate U.S. citizens if necessary, Madigan has been canceling plane tickets. Taking her kids to Sochi, she said, is out of the question. ""We fear not only for their safety, but also the repercussions that it would have if they were in the part of the world that experienced something horrible ... and just the logistics of getting out of there,"" she said. Security concerns like Madigan's are cited by some as a reason for sluggish Olympics ticket sales -- though vendors in the United States told CNN that demand is ""at expected levels"" and that last-minute sales will likely surge in Russia. Organizers in Russia said last week that around 30% of available tickets still hadn't been purchased, the Russian RIA Novosti news agency reported. If those seats remain unsold, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested volunteers might fill the remaining spots in the stands. 'I'm definitely going to be vigilant' Canadian Domenico Ciarallo said he has no plans to give up his tickets, but he's worried about security, too. He was watching TV with his mother in Montreal when news broke of last month's bombing at the Volgograd train station, a transit hub 400 miles way from Sochi. ""She looked at me and she said, 'You're not going to Sochi. I lost your father, I'm not losing one of my kids.'"" But Ciarallo said he didn't cancel his trip, despite his mother's concerns. He regularly travels around the world on business trips and knows that there's no predicting danger. ""Anything can happen on a plane or train or automobile. I don't live by that,"" he said. ""For sure, I'm worried. It's obviously a concern. But you know what, I'm definitely going to be vigilant, and keep my eyes open around me, and be aware of my surroundings."" In the meantime, he's looking forward to staying on a cruise ship docked alongside the coastal city and picking up his spectator pass so he can take in as many events as he can. As part of the stepped up security measures for this year's games, Russia required visitors to provide photos, passport information and ticket numbers in advance to receive the passes. That, Ciarallo said, shows how serious they are about keeping the Games safe. ""I'm probably 95% excited and nervous, and maybe 5% scared,"" he said. ""I think once we get there, I think that kind of fear will start to recede. I think you really have to hit the ground running and see."" Coach: Athletes must 'try and fight through' fears . Tara Lipinski, who won a gold medal in figure skating in the 1998 Winter Olympics and will be attending this year's games as a commentator for NBC, said she feels safe, despite the warnings. ""You can't take this lightly. But at the same time, being at the Olympics, I have never experienced security that high. So hopefully that will put these athletes at ease,"" she told CNN Monday. ""I'm hoping that the atmosphere is not overshadowed by this."" Boston Bruins coach Claude Julien, who will serve as assistant coach for Canada's men's hockey team, told ESPN this week that he's determined to push forward. ""There's no doubt that what's happened lately is certainly -- (terrorists are) trying to obviously shake us and probably in a lot of cases they are succeeding. But ... we have to try and fight through that,"" he said. ""At the same time, you have to hope that the people in charge are doing the best they can. There's never any guarantees in this life and you'd like to make it as safe as possible. That's basically all I can say, because my job is to go there and help coach a team and hope that the people in charge of that are going to do the best job they can and make it a successful Olympics."" Security has also become a top concern for journalists covering the Olympics this year, said NBC Special Correspondent Meredith Vieira, who will be cohosting the network's coverage of the opening ceremony. ""We had a lot of conversations at NBC News about it and (NBC) Sports, and after a certain point, it's a bit of a leap of faith, you know,"" she told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" ""You hope that the security is there. I hope that they (the Russians) share information more than they have with the U.S. Right now, that's kind of a rough point. But I'm going. And you know, they talk about that 'Ring of Steel,' and I hope it's there."" Analysts: Sochi faces unique risk . The Olympics are expected to bring 6,000 athletes from 85 countries to Sochi. And throngs of spectators are expected to watch from the stands, with nearly 40,000 security officers standing guard. It's nothing new to worry about security at the Olympics or any major sporting event. And authorities have vowed for months that safety is a top priority. But the situation is different in Sochi, some security experts say, particularly with recent terrorist attacks elsewhere in the country. ""The threats have been backed up with incidents, with attacks,"" said Carl Herron, a former crisis response agent for the FBI who was at the London and Turin Olympics. ""The percentage of something happening from here on is probably high. It can happen two days before the Olympics start, or it can happen today, so that really escalates the intensity of the security apparatus."" Terror analysts say Sochi is uniquely at risk because Islamic militant hotbeds are within the country -- leaving the Olympics closer than ever to danger. ""This group does not have to fly in from the Middle East or North Africa or Asia or some remote location,"" former FBI assistant director Tom Fuentes said. ""They are already in the neighborhood."" CNN's Phil Black and Brooke Baldwin contributed to this report.","Warnings about terrorists targeting the Sochi Games spur worries about security .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Pakistan to do more in the fight against global terrorism Tuesday, saying that the latest plot in Yemen shows that extremists continue to devise more ""perverse and terrible ways to kill innocent people."" Speaking at a New Delhi news conference at the end of her three-nation trip to Asia, Clinton said Washington was committed to going after anyone who posed a threat to the United States or its allies. ""We look to the government of Pakistan to do more,"" she told reporters. ""It needs to make sure its territory is not used as a launching pad for terrorist attacks anywhere, including inside of Pakistan."" Earlier, Clinton had said the United States believed several significant al Qaeda leaders, including Ayman al-Zawahiri, were on the run and living inside Pakistan. Al-Zawahiri inherited the terrorist network's leadership after the death of Osama bin Laden, who spent years on the lam in Pakistan, fleeing from safe house to safe house, according to one of his widows. ""We are intent upon going after those who are trying to keep al Qaeda operational and inspirational,"" Clinton said in an interview with India's NDTV. Clinton's remarks on Pakistan came after a meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna, who equally pressured Pakistan to act against perpetrators of terrorism in India, especially the 2008 assault on Mumbai that killed 166 people, including six Americans. Clinton said the Rewards for Justice program, aimed at obtaining information that could help convict suspected terrorists, demonstrated Washington's seriousness in going after such people. The program, established in 1984, has paid about $100 million to more than 70 people for information about terrorists. Rewards go as high as $25 million for information on al-Zawahiri and $10 million for information about Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, a Pakistani man wanted by Indian authorities in connection with the Mumbai attacks. Clinton said the foiled bomb plot in Yemen served as evidence that terrorists are getting more sophisticated. Investigators said terrorists in Yemen crafted an explosive device intended to slip past airport metal detectors and onto an airplane bound for the United States. ""The plot itself indicates that the terrorists keep trying ... to devise more and more perverse and terrible ways to kill innocent people,"" Clinton said. ""It is a reminder as to why we have to remain vigilant at home and abroad in protecting our nation and in protecting friendly nations and peoples like India and others.""","Hillary Clinton: Pakistan must ensure it is not used as a launching pad for terrorism .

"(CNN) -- In a season of lows, golf's No.1 Rory McIlroy hit a new low as he simply walked off the course following a disastrous start to the second round of his defense of the Honda Classic title in Florida. McIlroy was seven over par for eight holes and about to drop more shots after hitting his approach to the 18th -- his ninth -- into the water at PGA National. The Northern Irishman shook hands with his playing partners Mark Wilson and South Africa's Ernie Els and beat a hasty retreat with his coach and his caddie. Golf journalist David Dusek, tweeted that McIlroy ""was near tears as his caddie placed his clubs into the trunk of his blue BMW."" McIlroy later issued a statement apologizing for his ""sudden withdrawal."" He added: ""I have been suffering with a sore wisdom tooth, which is due to come out in the near future. It began bothering me again last night . ""It was very painful again this morning, and I was simply unable to concentrate. It was really bothering me and had begun to affect my playing partners. ""I came here with every intention of defending my Honda Classic title. Even though my results haven't revealed it, I really felt like I was rounding a corner. ""I regret having to make the decision to withdraw, but it was one I had to make."" McIlroy had battled to a level par first round at Palm Beach Gardens -- six shots behind first round leader Camilo Villegas of Colombia -- but had to rely on his recovery play around the greens to preserve his score and he finished with a bogey six on the 18th. But he was in good spirits Thursday night in a family occasion, tweeting: ""Having a great dinner celebrating my mums birthday!"" That optimistic mood would have been quickly shattered by his performance on the course Friday morning. Starting at the 10th hole, McIlroy was quickly in trouble, hitting his approach to the 11th into the water and running up a double bogey. A further bogey followed on the 13th before a disastrous display on the 16th where he found the water twice and ran up a triple bogey seven. Three putts from 40 feet on the par-three 17th left him seven over for the tournament and with little chance of making the halfway cut before he found yet more water on the testing par-five finishing hole. It is the first time the 23-year-old McIlroy has pulled out of a tournament. In later action, Woods battled to make the weekend on the cut line of level par after a second straight 70 with 23-year-old rookie Luke Guthrie leading the way on nine-under 131 after a superb seven-under 63. Villegas slumped to a sorry 77 to miss the cut. McIlroy's stumbling start to 2013 is in sharp contrast to his dominant displays last year and comes in the wake of signing a lucrative 10-year sponsorship deal with Nike, worth a reported $250 million. Honda Classic: Latest scores . As part of the deal, McIlroy changed his golf clubs to play with Nike branded equipment, which is also endorsed by his great rival and World No.2 Tiger Woods. He has enjoyed his previous success, including two major victories, playing with rival Titleist clubs. Results since have not lived up to expectations and he missed the cut in Abu Dhabi in his first tournament of the year. That was followed by a sorry first round exit -- Woods also went out on the same day -- at the WGC Accenture World Matchplay event in Arizona last week. Critics have also focused on the scale of McIlroy's new commercial ventures and three days before his Honda Classic defense he signed a three-year deal with audio products and headphone manufacturers Bose. On the eve of the tournament, McIlroy took to Twitter again: ""Had a great time with the Bose crew at the launch of our exciting new partnership last night. Looking forward to a great relationship."" McIlroy, who dates former World No.1 tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, will get an early chance to silence the doubters as he is due to tee off next week in the WGC-Cadillac Championship on Doral's daunting Blue Monster Course. It is all part of his preparation for a tilt at the U.S. Masters in Augusta, one of his major targets for the year as he bids to build on a 2012 season when he topped the money lists on the PGA and European Tours and claimed the U.S. PGA Championship in stunning fashion.","Rory McIlroy walks off the course during disastrous second round in Florida .

"(CNN) -- Two journalism groups have announced plans to honor a Sri Lankan reporter who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for articles that criticized the military. J.S. Tissainayagam was jailed for printing articles critical of Sri Lanka's military. A high court in the western Sri Lankan city of Colombo handed down the sentence to J.S. Tissainayagam on Monday, convicting him under the country's anti-terror laws. The editor of a monthly magazine, Tissainayagam was arrested in March 2008 for printing articles critical of the Sri Lankan military's treatment of civilians during the country's war on the Tamil Tiger rebel group. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is honoring Tissainayagam to highlight ""the depth of outrage at this unjust sentence."" ""Its harshness and the retroactive nature of the charges reflect vindictiveness and intolerance,"" the group said in a statement on Monday. It added that the reporter was in poor health and his confession was extracted under threat of torture. A second group, Reporters Without Borders, said it too will honor Tissainayagam with a newly-created award for journalists who display great courage in countries where press freedom is lacking. ""The imposition of this extremely severe sentence on Tissainayagam suggests that some Sri Lanka judges confuse justice with revenge,"" the group said. After his arrest, the Tamil journalist was held without charge for several months, prompting outrage from human rights and press freedom organizations. He was later charged under the country's controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act. Tissainayagam, 45, wrote for the Colombo-based Sunday Times newspaper and edited OutreachSL, a Web site geared toward the country's Tamil population. Prosecutors charged Tissainayagam with taking money from the Tamil Tiger rebels to fund the Web site. The site was, in fact, funded by a German aid project, Reporters Without Borders said. Tissainayagam's lawyer has said he will appeal. The case has drawn international attention to the plight of journalists in Sri Lanka, which ended its decades-long war against the Tamil rebels earlier this year. The country's military has been accused of numerous atrocities against civilians during the final months of the 26-year conflict. Sri Lanka has denied the accusations, and routinely rejects calls by human rights groups for independent investigations into its campaign against the Tigers.","J.S.

"(CNN) -- A tornado zeroed in Monday afternoon on a manufacturing plant in southwestern Kentucky, tossing pieces of the roof, collapsing part of the aluminum structure and injuring seven people, officials said. Elsewhere in the South, possible tornadoes and thunderstorms caused damage, injuries and power failures. Tornado watches were in effect Monday night in portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, northwestern Florida, most of Alabama and northern Georgia, including Atlanta. Severe thunderstorms were moving through and flood warnings were issued in some areas. About 184 employees were inside TGASK, a plant that makes automotive parts, when the storm arrived shortly after 1 p.m., said Paul Ray, spokesman for the Hopkinsville Police Department. None of the injured had life-threatening injuries, said spokeswoman Jessica Beckham of Jennie Stuart Medical Center. Ray said the injuries were mostly bumps and bruises. The manufacturing plant is between Hopkinsville and Pembroke. ""It could have been a lot worse,"" Ray told CNN.  The plant was ""very fortunate that at that time, there were very few injuries, and only minor injuries."" All employees had been accounted for, he added. The Kentucky Division of Emergency Management said possible tornadoes struck near La Center in Ballard County, with injuries being reported. One injury was reported from a storm that hit a mobile home park in Greenville, Kentucky, said Police Chief Darren Harvey. A likely tornado touched down two miles south of Georgetown in Grant Parish, Louisiana, on Monday afternoon, the Grant Parish Sheriff's Office said. There were reports of widespread damage in the community of Selma. Numerous trees and power lines were down across the area, the Sheriff's Office said. Officials in Arkansas reported at least three injuries from fast-moving storms. More than 58,000 customers were without power in Tennessee, according to Nashville Electric Service. Three possible tornadoes were reported in western Tennessee, the National Weather Service said. Storms also struck Humphreys County in Tennessee, about 60 miles west of Nashville, according to authorities. ""We were hit hard in our downtown area,"" said Waverly City Manager Buddy Frazier. Although no injuries were reported, trees, power lines, roofs and structures were down, Frazier told CNN. A dispatcher said a communications tower was down in Humphreys County, but workers were still able to send and receive messages.

"(CNN) -- Federal regulators are asking Graco Children's Products why it is not including infant seats in a major recall of child car seats. The company last month voluntarily recalled 3.7 million child car seats after regulators said the red release button in the harness can become stuck, preventing quick removal of a child in an emergency. But Graco Children's Products declined to recall an additional 1.77 million infant seats with the same problem, according to the government. On its web site, the company said it did not recall the rear-facing infant seats because there is a second way to release them. ""They are uniquely designed to detach from their base for quick release if needed,"" the company said. On Thursday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration demanded more information. NHTSA asked the company to explain its ""reasoning and rationale"" for excluding the infant seats from the recall. On Friday, Graco said it would comply with the request for information. ""Our car seats comply with all NHTSA's stringent performance standards and have withstood rigorous testing that far exceeds federal requirements,"" the company said in a statement. ""Despite this, for any concerned parent or guardian, we will continue to offer a replacement harness buckle at no cost."" Graco's recall included 3.7 million seats across 11 models manufactured between 2009 and 2013. The models involved: Cozy Cline, Comfort Sport, Classic Ride 50, My Ride 65, My Ride with Safety Surround, My Ride 70, Size 4 Me 70, Smartseat, Nautilus, Nautilus Elite, and Argos 70. But it declined the request to recall seven models that include rear-facing seats: Snugride, Snugride 30, Snugride 32, Infant Safe Seat-Step 1, Snugride 35, Tuetonia 35, and Snugride Click Connect 40.","Graco recalled 3.7 million child car seats last month voluntarily .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Tornado warning sirens echoed across northern Georgia on Monday as the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee swept through the area, damaging dozens of homes and knocking out power to thousands. One man was treated for ""superficial"" injuries after being rescued from the basement of a collapsed home near Woodstock, about 30 miles north of downtown Atlanta, Cherokee County Emergency Management Supervisor Robby Westbrook told CNN. He said sheriff's deputies counted more than 100 homes damaged in a roughly five-mile stretch around the town. And Cherokee County Fire Department spokesman Tim Cavender said several trees were knocked down around Holly Springs, about five miles north of Woodstock. High winds ripped the siding from homes and scattered strands of pink insulation around neighborhoods, while falling trees split others apart. The storm also knocked out power to about 20,000 Georgia Power customers, half of them around Atlanta, company spokeswoman Christy Ihrig told CNN. Another 5,000 were left in the dark in Savannah, on the Atlantic coast, with the remainder of outages scattered around the state, Ihrig said. Lee hit southwestern Louisiana on Sunday and has drenched the Southeast as it moves inland. One flooding death was reported in rural northeast Mississippi, while authorities were still searching for a teenager they said was swept off a beach on the Alabama coast. In eastern Tennessee, Chattanooga saw a record 8-plus inches of rain in a 24-hour period and was expecting another two inches, said David Gaffin, a National Weather Service meteorologist. The previous record of 7.61 inches had stood since 1886, he said. Two nearby creeks were both over flood stage, but both were expected to crest Tuesday. South Chicamauga Creek, near the Chattanooga airport, ran seven feet over its 18-foot flood stage Monday evening, while Lookout Creek, at 17 feet, was five feet over, Gaffin said. Lee weakened to a tropical depression after hitting land, but was projected to dump up to 20 inches of rain on some areas as it moves northeast, the National Hurricane Center said. The sole confirmed fatality as of Monday evening was in Tishomingo County, Mississippi, where one person drowned after floodwaters swept away a vehicle, state emergency officials said. But the threat of flash floods forced authorities in Jackson to evacuate more than two dozen families from an apartment complex early Monday, Jackson police spokeswoman Colendula Green said. The storm knocked down power lines and trees across Jackson, Mississippi's capital, officials said Monday. And in Alabama, searchers were still looking for a 16-year-old boy who was last seen on a beach near Gulf Shores on Sunday, Baldwin County Sheriff's spokesman Anthony Lowery told CNN. The search would continue as weather permits, he said. Lee's winds have also fueled wildfires that killed at least two people and threatened about 1,000 homes in Texas, officials said. At least 450 homes burned down and thousands of people were evacuated in Bastrop County, authorities there said Sunday night. In eastern Texas, a mother and her 18-month-old child died when flames engulfed their mobile home near Gladewater, the Gregg County Sheriff's Department said. State and local officials in Louisiana had reported flooding over the weekend in numerous parishes, including Iberia, Terrebonne, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Tammany and Jefferson. Crews in Crown Point, Louisiana, were scrambling Monday to create makeshift levees aimed at protecting homes from water that was creeping out of the Intracoastal Waterway. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu told reporters Sunday that the storm had dumped 10 to 13 inches of rain on the city and brought wind gusts of up to 50 mph. But New Orleans is otherwise fully functional, with all 24 pump stations in the city ""100% operational"" and roughly 200 people without power, down significantly from Saturday, the mayor said. Lee is expected to dump considerable rain in the East -- including New Jersey, New York and Vermont, where grounds are drenched and rivers are already full after Irene. The hurricane center noted Sunday night that ""flooding rains (are) expected to spread from the Gulf Coast to the Appalachians.""

"(CNN) -- Ethan Fisher is small for his age. The 8-year-old looks 6, though his natural athleticism aids him on the baseball field. He's outgoing and spontaneous -- a bundle of energy with big blue eyes and a welcoming smile. You'd never guess from looking at him that Ethan has Fanconi Anemia, a rare blood disorder that may one day kill him. ""He's the ask-for-forgiveness child,"" his dad, Florida State University head football coach Jimbo Fisher, says with a laugh. The FSU Seminoles have had an outstanding year. They're undefeated at 13-0. Their quarterback, Jameis Winston, recently won the 2013 Heisman trophy. The team is set to play Auburn in the BCS National Championship Game on January 6. Basically, Jimbo Fisher is on fire. ""I love what I do,"" he says. ""The more success I have, the more awareness I can bring to this disease."" In December 2010, Ethan fell ill with the flu. The Fishers were visiting family in Alabama, so his mom took Ethan to an urgent care clinic. A blood test revealed his platelet count was low. Probably nothing to worry about, the doctors told Candi Fisher. Just follow up on it when you get home. A few months later, Ethan was diagnosed with Fanconi Anemia. ""All we knew about the disease was what we looked up online,"" Jimbo says. ""It was all the worse-case scenario. We thought it was a complete death sentence. ""That day was..."" After a moment, he finds the word: ""devastation."" Fanconi Anemia is an inherited blood disorder that affects about 1 in every 130,000 people, says Dr. Margaret MacMillan, a pediatric hematologist oncologist at University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital. Patients with Fanconi Anemia can't repair their DNA. When their bodies make new cells, they come with mistakes -- big ones that can lead to birth defects, bone marrow failure and cancer. Acute myelogenous leukemia is seen 15,000 times more often in FA patients than it's seen in children in the general population. FA patients are also more at risk for head and neck, breast, and brain cancers. Close to 100% need bone marrow transplants before they reach adulthood. Other than stunted growth, Ethan didn't show any external signs of Fanconi Anemia, MacMillan says. About 60% of cases present with a birth defect, such as a shortened thumb. But the average pediatrician will see only one or two cases in a career, and it's difficult to diagnose. ""Most patients go into full bone marrow failure before they ever find out,"" she says. When he was diagnosed in 2011, doctors estimated Ethan would need a bone marrow transplant in three to five years. His blood is tested every few months, and once a year the family travels to Minnesota to get a bone marrow biopsy. ""It's hard ... for the parents, because he's a ticking time bomb,"" MacMillan says. A bone marrow transplant will buy Ethan more time, but it's not a cure. And the procedure itself is dangerous, requiring up to a year of recovery. ""Time isn't really on our side, or anybody's side, with this disease,"" Candi says. The prognosis for Fanconi Anemia patients is difficult to predict, MacMillan says. Research suggests the average lifespan is between 20 and 30 years, but the data are based on past success rates for bone marrow transplants. When MacMillan started at the Minnesota hospital 16 years ago, the survival rate after a bone marrow transplant was about 20%, she says. Now it's 85%. The Fishers created the nonprofit Kidz1stFund shortly after Ethan's diagnosis to increase awareness and raise money for research about Fanconi Anemia. In September, Jimbo joined forces with Paul Chryst, head coach at the University of Pittsburgh, to promote his cause. Players from both teams wore ""I fight Fanconi"" decals on the backs of their helmets during the televised Labor Day game. ""We thought, we can go private with this and keep it within, or we can go out publicly and not only help Ethan, but help all those kids who don't have a voice -- whose dads aren't the head football coach,"" Jimbo says. To date, Kidz1stFund has given more than $1.5 million to MacMillan's program. Donations stream in from all over the country. Most are in $100 or $200 amounts from fans who hear about Ethan and want to help. But the donation Candi remembers best came from former FSU player Andrew Datko, who gave $5 the night the foundation's PayPal account was set up. ""Five dollars to him was a lot of money because those players rely on their program money heavily,"" she says. ""It touched my heart."" The FSU players have been ""unbelievable,"" Jimbo says. They've all signed up for the bone marrow donor registry. Several have already donated bone marrow to help another child in need. And they're great with Ethan, who is doing his best to live life as a normal kid. His parents have told him about his Fanconi Anemia, but haven't explained the seriousness of the disease. ""He's very aware that all of these people have come together and are trying to help,"" Candi says. ""He has the rest of his life to worry."" Through the foundation, the Fishers have met other families who've been through similar struggles. A 15-year-old who hasn't yet gone into bone marrow failure gave Candi hope that Ethan could hold out a few more years. A practicing attorney named Christopher showed the Fishers that FA patients can live well into their 30s if the bone marrow transplant is successful. And Logan Stevenson, the 2-year-old who served as his parents' best man before passing away in August, cemented their resolve to do everything they can to fight Fanconi Anemia. ""God put us on this path for a reason,"" Candi says, ""And I don't feel he's going to let us down."" For Jimbo, that means winning as many football games as possible to keep FSU -- and Kidz1stFund -- in the spotlight. ""Oh, we're definitely going to try to win the championship.""","FSU head coach Jimbo Fisher's son has Fanconi Anemia, a rare blood disorder .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has apologized for his decision to walk off the course at last week's PGA Tour tournament, and insists he will not repeat the mistake anytime soon. The world No. 1 left fellow professionals, fans and commentators in shock after leaving in the middle of his second round at the Honda Classic in Florida, where he was defending his title. The Northern Irishman had two bogeys, a double bogey and a triple bogey before hitting his tee shot at the 18th into the water, having started at hole nine. That led him to walk away citing a sore wisdom tooth, although he now admits that his actions were wrong and regrettable. ""I realized pretty quickly that it wasn't the right thing to do,"" McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. ""No matter how bad I was playing I should have stayed out there. ""I wasn't in a good place with my golf game. My head was all over the place. It was a mistake. Everybody makes mistakes -- most of my mistakes are in the public eye. ""I'm 23. I'm still learning. I have learned from it and it won't happen again."" A year in sport is a long time and McIlroy's start to 2013 pales into insignificance compared to the form he was showing 12 months ago. Following the signing of a 10-year deal with Nike, which is reported to be worth $250 million, McIlroy has failed to recapture the magic which secured him the 2011 U.S. Open and 2012 PGA Championship titles. Since changing from his Titleist clubs to the Nike brand, he has failed to shine, missing the cut at Abu Dhabi and exiting the WGC Accenture World Matchplay event in Arizona at the first-round stage. With the Masters in Augusta on the horizon, McIlroy is aiming to rekindle the form which propelled him to the top of the PGA and European Tour money lists last year. And he is now hoping to start his resurgence at the $8.75 million WGC Cadillac Championship at Doral Thursday -- beginning with his swing. ""I know it's purely the swing. The equipment is fantastic. No problem at all,"" he said of his new equipment. ""When I make a good swing it does exactly what I want. It doesn't make a difference what clubs I play. ""I'm trying to change my swing but I'm trying to change it back to where it was. I have been in that position before and I can get it back again. ""There's no quick fix in golf. You've got to get to the root of the problem. It's still a work in progress."" McIlroy also revealed that he is waiting before deciding whether to add an extra event to his schedule before the Masters begins on April 11. His only other scheduled tournament after Doral is the Houston Open from March 28-31. ""I was waiting to see how I do this week,"" he said. ""Right now I haven't made a decision. The likelihood is I won't add an event. It's a possibility. I don't think it's likely.""","Rory McIlroy apologizes for walking off at Honda Classic .

"(CNN) -- Speaking at a press conference in New York on Monday, Dennis Rodman said he had received the following instruction from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they were together the previous week: ""Dennis, I want you to go over to America and say, 'Guess what, we want people to come over here, because we are not a bad country.' "" According to Rodman, ""He likes me because I am very true and very honest."" Kim let the American hold his only child, a baby girl. He also allowed Rodman to tell him ""Your grandfather and your father did some bad things,"" which cannot be something Kim hears very often. Rodman has somehow built up trust with the leader of probably the most isolated and paranoid country in the world. So the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Dennis Rodman signed an agreement for him to bring over 12 former NBA players to have two games with a North Korean team. However unlikely an ambassador Dennis Rodman might make, this is a positive development. Lack of trust is often cited as one of the main obstacles to reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. Pundits and policymakers argue that establishing trust is necessary to conclude a peace treaty to replace the Korean War Armistice and to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. If trust could be established, many people believe a North East Asian economic community could be formed that would bring greater prosperity and peace to the region. South Korean President Park Geun-hye has articulated a vision of trust-building to create a new era of inter-Korean relations and a North East Asian peace regime. Trust-building requires human interactions. Some of this can be handled by the state. For example, this week the governments of the two Koreas agreed to reconnect the inter-Korean military hotline that was shut off in the spring. In the inter-state realm, government-to-government dialogue is necessary for building trust and securing agreements in areas such as arms control. In some cases, governmental agreements are necessary before private actors can enter the picture. North Korean and South Korean governments will have to reach agreements before private firms and citizens can participate in business and tourism at for example, the KaesÅ .","Dennis Rodman and N.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court refused Wednesday to block the scheduled execution of a Missouri death row inmate after briefly granting a stay. In their three-sentence order, the justices gave no explanation for ultimately denying the last-chance appeals filed by lawyers for Herbert Smulls. He was set to be given a lethal injection overnight, but the appeals were filed with the high court mid-evening Tuesday, when five of the justices were preparing to attend President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. Shortly after the speech ended, Justice Samuel Alito -- who did not attend -- issued an order delaying the capital punishment, ""pending further order"" of the court. Court officials at the time offered no reason, but the nine justices likely wanted more time to fully consider the various appeals. There was no noted dissent. Smulls, 56, was convicted of killing Stephen Honickman and wounding his wife, Florence, while robbing their Chesterfield jewelry store in 1991. His lawyers had filed last-minute appeals, saying the state ought to disclose the compounding pharmacy that would provide the lethal injection drug.","Smulls was sentenced to death for killing a jewelry store owner .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- The mood around Independence Square in Ukraine's capital was very somber Sunday as thousands gathered, mourning the dozens of people killed in demonstrations during the past week and wondering who will take charge of the politically divided nation. They wondered where President Viktor Yanukovych, who reportedly tried to leave the country Saturday night, had gone. No one in the government appeared to know. There was a great uncertainty in the country after the rapidly moving events of the past 24 hours, which saw Parliament oust Yanukovych, free his political rival Yulia Tymoshenko from prison and schedule elections for May. It appeared that two political forces were trying to establish control of the country: the opposition and Yanukovych, who maintains that he is still President and still in control despite fleeing to the eastern part of the country. Clearly, though, his power has been greatly diminished . Oleksandr Yefremov, parliamentary leader of Yanukovych's Party of Regions, condemned the ousted President on Sunday in a video statement, blaming him for the ""robbery and deception"" of the nation. The former ruling party blamed Yanukovych for illegal orders that led to casualties, financial debt and shame in the eyes of the world, Yefremov said. It also remains to be seen how Russia -- Yanukovych's ally -- will respond with the Winter Olympics in Sochi closing on Sunday. Rapid changes to political scene . Tymoshenko, the former prime minister, was freed after 2Â½ years in prison Saturday and returned to the capital in a development many couldn't have imagined as dawn broke that day. She went to Independence Square and had strong words for Yanukovych. ""Today, Ukraine has finished with this terrible dictator,"" Tymoshenko told the cheering crowd. She served as prime minister from 2007 until she was forced out of office in 2010 after losing the election to Yanukovych. A year later, she was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia. The West considers her case politically motivated and has called her ""a political prisoner."" She is considered a hero of a 2004 revolution that forced the results of a presidential election won by Yanukovych to be thrown out. Where is the Presdent? Last we heard, Yanukovych was in Kharkiv, a pro-Russian stronghold near Ukraine's border with that nation. He tried to leave the country by plane but was turned away, authorities said. The country's acting interior minister said Sunday that government officials in Kiev don't know the whereabouts of Yanukovych and two of his top ministers. On Saturday, the President and his entourage attempted to board a charter flight without proper documentation in the eastern city of Donetsk, according to the head of Ukraine's Border Guard Service, Sergei Astakov. He was on the tarmac when he was turned back by security forces, Astakov said. But the President took to television airwaves, saying he's still the legitimate leader. He said he was forced to leave Kiev because of ""vandalism, crime and a coup."" ""I don't plan to leave the country. I don't plan to resign. I am the legitimate President,"" he said from Kharkiv. May elections . Parliament voted to oust the President and hold new elections on May 25. It also appointed Oleksandr Turchinov, the speaker, to take on Yanukovych's duties until then. Lawmakers also fired several ministers, including the foreign and education chiefs. But who will lead the nation is still a big question. Tymoshenko announced Sunday that she doesn't want to be considered for the nomination for prime minister, according to a statement posted on the Batkivshchyna party website. The opposition coalition is a chaotic mix of voices, each working to assert dominance. Former world champion boxer Vitali Klitschko has been the most well-known opposition figure during the crisis. He heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party. But the opposition bloc goes well beyond Klitschko and his party. Then there's Arseniy Yatsenyuk, another opposition figure and former foreign minister. Last month, the President offered a package of concessions under which Yatsenyuk would have become the prime minister and Klitschko deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues. The opposition refused. Russia's influence . The series of concessions started Friday with Parliament overwhelmingly approving the return of the nation's 2004 constitution. Reinstating it gives the President less power -- a key demand of protesters who'd taken over Kiev City Hall for weeks -- and paves the way for lawmakers to appoint key ministers. Close ally Russia has been busy hosting the Winter Olympics, which end Sunday. But it's closely linked to the crisis, which started in November, when Yanukovych scrapped a European Union trade deal and turned toward Russia. Russia offered to lend money to Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and lower its gas prices. The deal sent protesters to the streets as Russia pressured Yanukovych to crack down on demonstrators. On Saturday, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, condemned what he called Western attempts to influence the outcome of the tumult in Ukraine. ""Either they don't understand the consequences of what they're doing, or they're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing Ukraine and therefore Eastern Europe,"" Churkin said in a post on his official Twitter account. Churkin has accused the opposition of wanting to take power by force. ""If those so-called democratic opposition leaders come to power on the shoulders of thugs, that will not produce democracy in Ukraine,"" he said. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke about the situation in Ukraine. According to written statement from a senior State Department official, Washington strongly prodded Moscow to accept the results of the Parliament's decisions. Kerry also asked Russia to work with the United States and the European Union on enabling ""critically needed reforms"" and to not use military force in the country, which shares a border with western Russia.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy salvaged his ""frustrating year"" with a dramatic victory in the Australian Open Sunday to shatter Adam Scott's hopes of completing his domestic triple crown. World No.2 Scott was bidding to match Robert Allenby's 2005 feat of winning the Australian PGA, Australian Masters and Australian Open crowns in the same season, but instead McIlroy took advantage of some late lapses to capture his only title of 2013. The Northern Irishman rolled home a 10-foot birdie putt on the final hole to complete a final round of six-under 66 for 18-under 270. It left him a shot clear of Scott, who had led since carding a course record 62 at Royal Sydney on the first day. McIlroy, who has been blighted by problems both on and of the course, could scarcely believe his good fortune, but it was reward for dogged play having started the final round four shots behind Scott. ""I'm really pleased but since September I've just felt in a better place mentally with some of the things off the course,"" he told gathered reporters. McIlroy, who has changed his management team, which now includes his father Gerry, showed promise of better things to come with his sixth place finish in the WGC-HSBC Champions event in China and tied fifth in the World Tour Championship in Dubai. Having started 2013 in top spot, he has slipped to sixth in the rankings with a previous best finish of second in the Texas Open and disappointing displays in the four majors. ""It's been a frustrating year,"" he admitted. ""I've worked hard to win golf tournaments and it's really nice to do it today."" U.S. Masters champion Scott looked a heavy favorite to finish the season on a historic high, but was let down by his putter. ""It was always going to be a tough day and Rory made his move and I just couldn't knock in the putts you expect to make,"" he said. Scott might have moved two clear of McIlroy but he three putted the 16th and lipped out a birdie effort on the 17th. Still leading by a shot playing the last, Scott's approach went past the flag and a poor chip left him a 40 footer for par, which he missed, leaving the door open for two-time major winner McIlroy. Australia's John Senden shot a final day 66 to claim third spot, seven shots adrift. But he secured one of three 2014 British Open Championship qualifying spots on offer this week, with the others claimed by compatriots Bryden Macpherson and Rhein Gibson. Meanwhile on the European Tour, former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel won the Alfred Dunhill Championship for the second straight year. The South African finished four shots clear of Englishman Richard Finch at Leopard Creek to delight the home galleries.","Rory McIlroy wins Australian Open by one shot .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Navy divers have recovered five bodies so far from an Indian navy submarine that exploded and sank in Mumbai this week, authorities said Saturday. The Indian government warned that there was almost no hope of finding any survivors among the 13 other sailors who were in the submarine when it was hit by the unexplained blast at a naval dockyard early Wednesday. Navy divers searching the trapped submarine for three days have recovered five bodies so far. Their task has been complicated by poor visibility inside the stricken submarine's passageways, which are full of oily, muddy water and wreckage. Adding to their difficulties, the heat of the explosion warped some of the hatches inside the vessel, blocking the divers' access to certain areas. The bodies found so far are unidentifiable because they were so severely burned, authorities said. They have been taken to a naval hospital for DNA identification. Searching 'every inch' The state of the bodies and conditions inside the INS Sindhurakshak, a Russian-built submarine, mean that ""finding any surviving personnel within the submarine is unlikely,"" the ministry said. ""The feasibility of locating bodies of personnel in the forward part of the submarine is also very remote, as the explosion and very high temperatures, which melted steel within, would have incinerated the bodies, too,"" it warned. But divers will scour through submarine until all the bodies are recovered, the ministry said. Authorities say they have contacted the families of all the 18 missing personnel and are keeping them updated. Worst peacetime disaster . An investigation into the explosion and fire -- the Indian navy's worst peacetime disaster -- is under way. Navy officials say they so far can't pinpoint the cause. Salvage work on the diesel-electric submarine won't begin until the search for bodies is over, the defense ministry said. The Sindhurakshak had recently returned from an extensive refitting in Russia before the disaster. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Khushbu Shah from Atlanta.","Divers are scouring the submarine for the 13 remaining sailors .

"(CNN) -- Syria, we are told, is not like Libya. The factors that coalesced to allow for international intervention in the latter do not apply in the former. There are clear differences -- in geography, topography, the role of neighboring states, the existence of liberated territory and the posture of the U.N. Security Council -- that mitigate against external intervention. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores the most salient factor that should guide our thinking and the international community's response to events in Syria today. That's the ongoing crimes against humanity visited upon the people of Syria by the Bashar al-Assad regime and the human rights catastrophe that is unfolding before our eyes. While many governments repress their populations and respond with violence to public demands for change, what distinguishes the Syrian case is that all the leading human rights organizations -- Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the U.N. Human Rights Council -- have unanimously characterized the policies of the Syrian regime as ""crimes against humanity."" This means the mafia state the Assad family has been running for 42 years belongs in the same moral category as Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic and Rwanda's Hutu generals. Speaking last week in New York, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay affirmed that the ""nature and scale of abuses committed by Syrian forces indicate that crimes against humanity are likely to have been committed since March 2011. Independent, credible and corroborated accounts indicate that these abuses have taken place as part of a widespread and systematic attack on civilians. ""Furthermore, the breadth and patterns of attacks by military and security forces on civilians and the widespread destruction of homes, hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure indicate approval or complicity of the authorities at the highest level."" The merciless brutality of the Syrian regime comes as no surprise. A comparison of the human rights records of member states of the Arab League places Syria at the extreme end of a spectrum of repression. Arguably, only Saddam Hussein's Iraq was worse. While the 1982 massacre in Hama is frequently mentioned to highlight the viciousness of the Assad regime, less well-known are the horrors of Syria's prison system. Tens of thousands have passed through its doors. Untold numbers never made it out. A Human Rights Watch report on the notorious Tadmor prison describes ""deaths under torture"" and ""summary executions on a massive scale."" One former inmate described the place as a ""kingdom of death and madness"" and emaciated prisoners were compared to ""survivors of Nazi concentration camps."" But this was just one jail in a veritable archipelago. One day the full story of Syria's prison system and internal human rights nightmare under the Assad family will be told. When the truth emerges, it might rival the horrors chronicled in Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ""Gulag Archipelago."" In thinking about how to respond to events in Syria today, the colossal scale of human suffering -- past and present -- should be foremost in our minds. Any discussion of external intervention should be guided by what the Syrian people actually want from the outside world. This requires listening to the Syrian democratic opposition. The opposition is divided on the issue of foreign military intervention, a chasm that is diminishing daily as the atrocities increase. Until there is a broad consensus, the following nonmilitary steps can be pursued immediately. They would be a huge boon of support for the opposition and would be endorsed by all Syrian democrats: . -- Officially recognize the Syrian National Council as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. -- Establish a special U.N. Commission of Inquiry along the lines of Darfur. -- Refer the senior leadership of the al-Assad regime to the International Criminal Court. -- Provide humanitarian air drops of food and medicine to besieged communities. -- Keep the global spotlight on the Assad regime and its atrocities. There is a historic struggle for democracy under way in Syria today. It represents the aspirations of a people to free themselves from the tyranny of one the most brutal regimes the developing world has ever seen. Claims that the conflict has now turned violent ignore the overarching reality that for most of the past 11 months the protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful, and notwithstanding the emergence of the Free Syrian Army, most of the protests continue to be nonviolent today. What is truly amazing about the spread of the Arab Spring to Syria is not that some people have taken up arms in the face of a brutal crackdown but that is it didn't happen sooner, given Assad's crimes against humanity and that violent tactics haven't been adopted by more people. The very fact that an indigenous internal struggle for democracy could emerge in one of the worst police states in the Arab world and be sustained for so long is both mind-boggling and inspiring. The heroic struggle in Syria today represents the best of the human spirit. It is fundamentally about the most basic political value we take for granted in the West, the right of a people to self-determination. It deserves our full support. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- A study released Thursday claims that troops who report suffering post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of sexual trauma -- namely for rape, assault or harassment -- are much less likely to get benefits than troops claiming to suffer from PTSD because of other causes. The report from the Service Women's Action Network and the American Civil Liberties Union looked into what is called military sexual assault trauma. Specifically, how did troops (male or female) who claim to have experienced ""sexual violence"" fare in getting disability benefits? Not well for many of them, the advocates claim, calling the ""often unsuccessful"" effort to get such benefits ""an unfair fight."" ""They face a broken bureaucracy, with protracted delays and inaccurate adjudications,"" the report's authors write. ""And ... it is clear that veterans who survive in-service sexual trauma also face discrimination in seeking compensation."" They point to data, obtained following lawsuits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, that show a persistent gap in the success rate of those troops seeking benefits for PTSD tied to sexual trauma compared to those who say they got PTSD for other reasons. The Department of Veterans Affairs responded in a statement, saying it is ""committed to ensuring that veterans have access to military sexual trauma-related health care and disability benefits."" The ACLU/SWAN report goes through the 2012 fiscal year and does not include FY 2013, which ended September 30. Data for the more recent fiscal year, the VA points out, shows a 6-percentage point gap in benefits grant rates for those with sexual trauma PTSD claims and all PTSD claims . Even without this data, those claiming PTSD due to sexual trauma have had increasing success in getting benefits. The claims of 56.8% of them went through in fiscal year 2012, much higher than the 30% success rate in fiscal year 2008. The report's authors point out approval rates for PTSD claims not related to sexual traumas went up as well: For FY2012, those were at 73.3%, up 20% from a few years earlier. ""The gap is really striking,"" said Anu Bhagwati, executive director of SWAN. ""...The gap got even larger in 2011 and was large, as well, in 2012."" The VA, however, highlighted training and other efforts that have led to the significant increase in the number of troops claiming sexual trauma who have received disability benefits. ""The Under Secretary for Benefits (Allison Hickey) has spearheaded VA's efforts to ensure that these claims are adjudicated compassionately and fairly, with sensitivity to the unique circumstances presented by each individual claim,"" the department said. ""... Hickey's efforts have dramatically improved VA's overall sensitivity."" Notably, claims tied to military sexual trauma represent a fraction of the PTSD claims overall that Veterans Affairs sees. Over the 2008 through 2012 fiscal years, for instance, there were 15,862 such claims out of 591,456 overall. The report highlights significant differences among Veterans Affairs regional offices in benefit grants for sexual trauma. Co-author Kathryn Mammel, from the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale, said that the variation between VA offices for all PTSD claims ""is not nearly as widespread"" as that for those specifically tabbed to sexual trauma. The office with the lowest approval rate for sexual trauma claims in FY 2012 is in St. Paul, Minnesota, signing off on just 25.8% of requests. Offices in Detroit and St. Louis had similarly low rates, while offices in Nashville, Los Angeles and elsewhere showed significant upticks in recent years.","ACLU, SWAN release a report about troops seeking benefits for sexual trauma .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- For the Xhosa people of South Africa, death is traditionally not something to be talked about or to be planned for, no matter how inevitable or close it may seem. But those close to Nelson Mandela had little choice as the country's first black leader lay in a Pretoria hospital and then at home in Johannesburg on life support. In the final years of his life, secret plans were hammered out between the government, the military and his family as they prepared for a fitting farewell for a great man. Below is a breakdown of how those plans will unfold over the next 10 days, culminating in a state funeral to be broadcast to millions worldwide and a very private farewell for those closest to him. As is often the case with events of this magnitude, plans might change due to weather, security and other factors. But for now, this is what the authorities and the family hope will happen. According to multiple sources involved with the planning of the final farewell to the South African icon, the 10 days of mourning will combine both Western traditions and those of the Thembu, Mandela's native clan. Day 1 to Day 4 . Mandela passed away at 8.50 p.m. Thursday (1.50 p.m. ET), surrounded by his family, South African President Jacob Zuma said. CNN understands that during his final hours, Mandela would have also been surrounded by Thembu elders. Importantly, at some stage - either at his home or in the mortuary - the traditional leaders will gather for a first ceremony, a tradition called ""the closing of the eyes."" Throughout the ceremony, they'll be talking to Mandela, as well as to his tribal ancestors, to explain what's happening at each and every stage to ease the transition from life to beyond. After the ceremony, it's believed Mandela's body will be embalmed at the mortuary, which is understood to be a military hospital in Pretoria. Day 5 . No formal public events will be held until five days after Mandela's death when tens of thousands of people are expected to converge on the FNB Stadium, known as Soccer City in Soweto for a memorial service. It was at that stadium that in July 2010 Mandela made his last public appearance at the World Cup final. Spectators rose to their feet, their cheers partly drowned out by the deafening shriek of thousands of vuvuzelas to pay tribute to the then-92- year-old who some had feared might be too infirm to show up. In stark contrast to the mood of elation, the atmosphere on Day 5 is expected to hang heavy with grief as a nation mourns Madiba. It is unclear whether Mandela's casket will be there. Some world leaders might attend this memorial service instead of the state funeral later on in the week. A White House Official tells CNN the administration is working on plans for President Barack Obama to travel to South Africa to attend the memorial service. Day 6 to 8 . According to sources, Mandela's body will then lie in state for three days at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the seat of power of the South African government. The first day will be reserved for dignitaries. The public will be allowed to file past his casket on days 7 and 8. Viewing hours are expected to be limited to daylight. Long lines will likely form from the very early hours of the morning. It was at the historic Union Buildings that Mandela was inaugurated as president on May 10, 1994. On that extraordinary day, crowds converged around the building to witness history being made. That day, a former political prisoner achieved what was once unthinkable and became South Africa's first post-apartheid black leader. Day 9 . Nine days after Mandela's death, a military aircraft will leave a Pretoria airbase and fly south to Mthatha, the main town in the South African province of Eastern Cape. Thembu elders and members of the Mandela family make the journey with Mandela's casket. Thousands of mourners are expected to line the streets from Mthatha airport to watch as the military transports Mandela's casket on a gun carriage to the remote village of Qunu, where the former leader spent his childhood years. Along the way the procession is expected to pause for prayers to allow ordinary South Africans to pay their respects. Once at Mandela's house, the military will formally pass responsibility for his remains to his family. The South African flag that is expected to be draped over the coffin will be replaced with a traditional Xhosa blanket, symbolizing the return of one of their own. At dusk, ANC leaders, local chiefs and Mandela's family are expected to gather for a private night vigil before a very public funeral the next day. Day 10 . The funeral and burial will be on the grounds of Mandela's Qunu home. It's expected that thousands of people, including dozens of heads of state, will gather for the state funeral. The funeral will take place under a large tent nestled in the hills where Mandela ran and played as a child. A tight military cordon is expected, in an attempt to assuage security fears. The event will be broadcast to an audience of millions around the world. At midday - when the summer sun is high in the sky - Mandela will be buried into the rocky soil of his homeland. Only a few hundred close family members will bid that final farewell to Mandela as he is laid to rest. The burial area has been especially built for him; some of Mandela's long deceased family members are already buried at the site. It will be, according to custom, a homecoming. His grave site is surrounded by rocky outcrops, hardy grass used for the grazing cattle and bright orange aloe plants. The aloes are indigenous succulents which are hardy, drought-resistant, medicinal plants that bloom across the bushveld when all else is dry and dull. A symbolic floral gesture to a man whose life was filled with sacrifice and tragedy but who triumphed with a tenacity of spirit and hope in even the darkest of days.","CNN has a detailed account of how plans will unfold over the next 10 days .

"New York (CNN) -- A man arrested in police probes following the apparent drug overdose death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to drug charges, and two co-defendants in the case had not-guilty pleas entered for them at their arraignment. Robert Vineberg, 57, who remains in jail after his bail was set Friday at nearly a quarter of a million dollars total, was arraigned on three counts of criminal possession of heroin. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, according to his attorney Edward Kratt. Kratt filed a motion seeking judicial diversion through the drug diversion court, which is a part of the New York State Supreme Court. If the motion is accepted by the judge, Vineberg will be evaluated for drug treatment. This means the charges against Vineberg's could eventually be dropped if the motion goes through and Vineberg is successful in treatment, Kratt told CNN. Vineberg has been a heroin addict for ""quite a while,"" said his attorney. They expect a decision regarding the motion on March 10. The judge entered a not-guilty plea for Juliana Luchkiw and Max Rosenblum, both 22, who appeared in court Monday charged with one count of criminal possession of cocaine, according to Rosenblum's attorney, Daniel Hochheiser. The three were arrested earlier this month as police investigated drugs found in Philip Seymour Hoffman's apartment. The Academy Award-winning actor was found dead February 2 of an apparent drug overdose. Investigators found close to 50 packets of what they believe to be heroin in the actor's apartment. Police immediately set out to track down Hoffman's source for heroin. Vineberg, Luchkiw, and Rosenblum were arrested on February 4 after police raided a Manhattan apartment, recovering 350 small plastic bags of what is believed to be heroin with labels that match those found at Hoffman's residence, according to officials. Vineberg had Hoffman's phone number stored in his phone, according to law enforcement. Vineberg hopes to make bail this week, which is set at $40,000 cash and $200,000 bond, according to his attorney. The heroin epidemic, and the antidote for overdose .

"(CNN) -- The fallout of an investigation into a drug testing lab could cause some trials in Delaware to be postponed for months. Delaware State Police investigators have taken control of the lab inside the state's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner after discovering drug evidence submitted to the lab for analysis had been tampered with, substituted or gone missing, a state police spokesman said Monday. State investigators, along with the Delaware Attorney General's Office, launched a joint investigation late last month when a sealed evidence envelope was opened in court during a drug prosecution in Kent County and prosecutors discovered Oxycontin pills had been replaced with blood pressure medicine. The drug lab is sealed as police inspect and audit the drugs in evidence there, and the lab has stopped conducting drug analysis. State police spokesman Sgt. Paul Shavack said it is too early to know how many criminal drug cases might have been affected. In light of the investigation, the state has requested all pending trials involving drug evidence submitted to that drug lab be stayed for 60 days. Police say there are no charges pending. Police departments around the state have been asked to audit their own drug evidence for any potential evidence tampering.","State investigators have taken control of a drug testing lab in Delaware .

"(CNN) -- Regulators this week demanded General Motors answer, under oath, 107 questions designed to find out when it first knew that some cars contained dangerously faulty ignition switches and what the company did about it. A letter this week from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to GM follows the company's decision in recent weeks to recall more than 1.36 million cars over the problem. The switches may unintentionally move from the ""run"" position to the ""accessory"" or ""off"" positions, resulting in a loss of power and limiting brakes, steering and airbags. GM said it is aware of 31 crashes and 13 deaths that may be linked to the problem in vehicles from the 2003-07 model years. NHTSA's action comes amid criticism that GM and safety regulators were too slow to initiate a recall after signs of trouble surfaced a decade ago. GM last month issued an unusual public apology and executed sizable recalls in two stages. It also provided NHTSA with a five-page chronology that began with GM's discovery in 2004 of an incident involving a Chevrolet Cobalt that lost engine power. The chronology runs through the beginning of this year. But on Tuesday, NHTSA asked the company to fill in the blanks. It sent GM a letter demanding the manufacturer answer 107 questions by April 3. Failure to do so would expose GM to a potential $35 million fine, the maximum allowed. The auto industry and NHTSA, at times, have over the years been accused by advocates of moving too slowly or not aggressively enough to address certain safety concerns. The issue came to a head last decade over motorist complaints around unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles. The Japanese manufacturer wound up issuing massive recalls, paying record fines, defending itself in huge lawsuits, and overhauling how it deals with U.S. regulators. Since that multi-year investigation, the industry has been quicker to identify problems in many cases and issue recalls, and NHTSA has made improvements in how it handles those matters. Still, not all issues are resolved without controversy. In its letter to GM, NHTSA demands a list of documents and records, including engineering drawings, field reports, consumer complaints, lawsuits against GM, and transcripts of deposition testimony by any GM employee, former employee, consultant or expert witness. It also seeks internal emails and records about the company's deliberations about the problem. GM spokesman Alan Adler said the company has been in contact with NHTSA about the request. ""We always cooperate and we fully intend to do everything they're asking by the time they're asking,"" he said. ""The intent is to comply with their date."" GM's new chief executive, Mary Barra, has said the company acted ""without hesitation"" and that it went ""well beyond"" the recommendation of technical experts. But in its chronology, GM said some company engineers knew of the problem with the switch 10 years ago. Barra said the problems were first brought to the attention of her team ""a few weeks ago"" and that she led a committee that acted immediately when informed about the problem. In the company's apology, GM North American President Alan Batey admitted in a statement last month: ""The process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been."" Even that acknowledgment is the subject of a NHTSA question -- Describe in detail the ways in which GM's process ""was not as robust as it should have been"" and GM's plans, if any, to change its process."" On Thursday, former NHTSA administrator and longtime safety advocate Joan Claybrook asked GM to be forthcoming when notifying car owners about a recall. ""It is imperative that GM's letter to owners be a true safety alert, emphasizing the real possibility of death or severe injury,"" she wrote in a letter to the company. The recall includes the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, Pontiac's G5 and Solstice, and Saturn's Sky and Ion. GM said dealers will replace the ignition switch to prevent ""unintentional or inadvertent key movement."" Until that is performed, vehicle owners should use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring, GM said.

"(CNN) -- Controversial French soccer star Nicolas Anelka faces a possible five-match suspension after being charged by the English Football Association (FA) Tuesday for making a ""quenelle"" gesture last month. The 34-year-old striker made the sign, that many believe is a Nazi salute in reverse, after scoring for his Premier League team West Bromwich Albion against West Ham on December 28. Anelka faces a minimum five-match ban if found guilty by the FA and has until 1800 GMT on Thursday to respond to the charge. ""Anelka has received a 34-page document explaining the allegations against him. The player is now considering his options,"" West Brom said. The FA, which appointed an expert to help determine the outcome of its investigation, can choose to increase the ban if it sees fit. The FA said in a statement: ""It is alleged that, in the 40th minute of the fixture, Anelka made a gesture which was abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper, contrary to FA Rule E3(1). ""It is further alleged that this is an aggravated breach, as defined in FA Rule E3(2), in that it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief."" The news follows Monday's announcement that West Brom's main sponsor, unhappy with the Anelka incident, will end its deal with the club at the end of this season. However, new West Brom manager Pepe Mel showed his support for Anelka by selecting him for his first game in charge against Everton -- and the club said Tuesday he would remain available for selection until the FA makes its ruling. ""Following this, the club will conclude its own internal enquiry,"" West Brom said. After Monday's 1-1 draw at The Hawthorns -- a result which left West Brom 13th in the English Premier League table -- Anelka took to his official Twitter account to thank the club for its backing. Anelka has insisted that the gesture, which involves pointing the right arm straight down and touching that arm with the left hand, was a dedication to his friend Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, a controversial French comedian with whom the move is widely associated. ""(The) meaning (of) quenelle: anti-system. I do not know what the word religion has to do with this story! Of course, I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic,"" the footballer, who converted to Islam in 2004, tweeted last month after the incident. After making the gesture against West Ham, Anelka agreed to his club's request that he would not repeat it. The FA introduced new disciplinary measures in May 2013 stating that players involved in discrimination cases, including racism, religion, sexuality and disability, will be suspended for a minimum of five matches. A second offense, meanwhile, will lead to an automatic minimum ban of 10 matches. While Anelka is the first player to be held to account under the new guidelines, Croatia international Josip Simunic was banned for 10 matches by FIFA in December for his ""pro-Nazi"" chants as he celebrated his country's qualification for the 2014 World Cup. FIFA also introduced its new disciplinary measures in May 2013. Linked to rising anti-Semitism in France, the ""quenelle"" has sat uncomfortably with Zoopla, a property website co-owned by Jewish businessman Alex Chesterman. Zoopla said it will not renew its two-year deal with West Brom, turning down the possibility of a one-year extension. ""Zoopla has been reviewing its position over the past few weeks in light of the actions of striker, Nicolas Anelka, during the match against West Ham over the Christmas period, and has decided to focus its attention on other marketing activities after this season,"" the company said in a statement. When West Brom announced the partnership with Zoopla in May 2012, an official described it as ""the most comprehensive deal in the club's history."" The club reacted to Zoopla's statement by saying it had been aware that the sponsorship deal could end at the end of the current season and so ""has been planning accordingly."" Anelka is not the only sports star to be embroiled in controversy over the ""quenelle."" Several other French athletes -- basketballer Tony Parker as well as footballers Samir Nasri and Mamadou Sakho -- all having apologized for any offense caused when they were pictured making the gesture. It was popularized by Dieudonne, who ran in the European elections as an anti-Zionist and who has been fined several times in France for anti-Semitic commentary, a charge over which the 47-year-old faces an investigation by the Paris prosecutor's office. The French government recently banned one of Dieudonne's live performances, successfully doing so in Nantes earlier this month despite some intense legal wrangling. It is not the first time former France international Anelka has landed himself in hot water over the years. During his time at Spanish club Real Madrid in 2000, Anelka fell out with coach Vicente Del Bosque and was handed a 45-day suspension for refusing to train. At Chelsea in 2012 he was banned from using the first-team car park, forced to use separate changing rooms and made to train with the club's youth team before moving to Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua. His international career has also been littered with bust-ups, and was told to leave the France squad during the 2010 World Cup after falling out with coach Raymond Domenech -- it resulted in an 18-match ban from his own federation, but he laughed it off and announced he would no longer be available for his country.","Nicolas Anelka is charged by the English Football Association for the gesture he made last month .

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday revisited one of its high-profile precedents in recent years -- its ban on the death penalty for intellectual disability -- the application of which appeared to again divide the bench. At issue: how states may define mental retardation -- within the context of inexact IQ tests -- when determining whether convicted murderers deserve capital punishment. The high court left that question unanswered in 2002, but advocates for a death-row inmate in Florida say that state's limits are too rigid and thus unconstitutional. The justices struggled to determine whether Florida's scheme -- a sharp statistical cutoff that protects only those with an IQ under 71 -- is properly within the state's discretion. ""Could the state say somebody who is mentally retarded enough -- so mentally retarded as not to be responsible and not to be subject to the death penalty certainly could not have pulled all of this [crime] off?"" asked Justice Antonin Scalia. ""This is not a person who is that significantly mentally retarded."" But Justice Elena Kagan told the state, ""What your cutoff does is it essentially says the inquiry has to stop there. And the question is how is that at all consistent with anything we ever say when it comes to the death penalty? ... It stops that in its tracks, as to a person who may or may not even have a true IQ of over 70, and let alone it stops people in their tracks who may not be mentally retarded."" The justices in Atkins v. Virginia a dozen years ago concluded ""the mentally retarded should be categorically excluded from execution."" But defining what is now termed intellectual disability was essentially left for the states to resolve. Freddie Lee Hall was convicted and sentenced to death in 1978, along with an accomplice, for the brutal murder of Karol Hurst. The 21-year-old Leesburg resident was seven months pregnant. She was abducted from a grocery store, raped, shot to death, and her body dragged into the woods. Later that evening, Hall and his accomplice were involved in a separate shooting death of a sheriff's deputy. Ten years later, Hall's attorney's appealed, saying the man had a lengthy record of mental retardation diagnoses. An average of various tests put his IQ slightly above 70, but within what is called a SEM -- standard error of measurement. The state supreme court said Florida's law means any capital inmate above that benchmark cannot take the next step and present further mitigating evidence to demonstrate his mental capacity lacks culpability for his crimes. During the high court's arguments, Hall's lawyer, Seth Waxman, said Florida and four other states -- Alabama, Idaho, Kentucky, and Virginia -- have ignored the court's precedent, trying to impose inflexible standards that go against the accepted views of professional psychologists. ""If a state conditions the opportunity to demonstrate mental retardation on obtained IQ test scores, it cannot ignore the measurement error that is inherent in those scores that is a statistical feature of the test instrument itself,"" Waxman told the bench. Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote in the appeal may prove decisive, asked, ""Is there any evidence that society in general gives substantial deference to the psychiatric profession in this respect?"" Justice Samuel Alito pressed for an acceptable standard that was different from Florida's benchmark. ""Does the Eighth Amendment permit a state to assign to the defendant the burden of persuasion on IQ above 75? Can they assign that burden above 70?"" he asked. ""Can they assign that to the defendant, and if they can what is the standard of proof that the defendant has to meet?"" Florida Solicitor General Allen Winsor said the defendant had five so-called Wechsler IQ tests conducted post-conviction and scored above 70 on all of them -- 71, 72, 73, 74, and 80. ""When you are dealing with things like mental diagnosis or things in the medical field generally, there is good reason for this court to do as it has historically, which is to defer to reasonable legislative judgments,"" Winsor said. But Kennedy said professional clinicians have a built-in margin for error. ""It seems to me what the state is saying here in declining to use that, is that it declines to follow the standards that are set by the people that designed and administer and interpret the tests."" ""Your rule prevents us from getting a better understanding of whether that IQ score is accurate or not because we cannot even reach the adaptive functioning prong"" the clinical diagnosis that typically follows an initial IQ test, added Kennedy. ""You prevent it at the outset."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor followed: ""That's been the same in all medical diagnosis."" Hall's lawyers are ""just arguing that we should stay where it's always been, which is using the SEM."" Another issue raised parenthetically was whether Hall's 35 years behind bars amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. Kennedy pointed out the last 10 people executed in the state average nearly 25 years on death row. Scalia suggested much of the delays were ""because of rules that we have imposed"" giving inmates multiple opportunities to appeal their capital sentences. A ruling in Hall v. Florida (12-10882) is expected by June.","High-profile Supreme Court precedent under examination again .

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- George Zimmerman apologized Friday to the family of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed African-American teen that he shot in a confrontation that riveted a nation and sparked intense discussions about race, racial profiling and gun laws. Zimmerman spoke moments before a Florida judge set a $150,000 bond that will let him get out of jail while he awaits trial. ""I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son,"" Zimmerman said in an unusual appeal directly to Martin's family before he testified in the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford. ""I thought he was a little bit younger than I was, and I did not know if he was armed or not."" Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, said after the hearing that his client was responding to an interview in which Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, said she wanted to hear from the man who shot her son. ""He didn't want to defend himself, he didn't want to discuss the facts of the case. He heard the request of the family, and he wanted to respond to it,"" O'Mara said, adding that an attempt to apologize to the family in private was rebuffed. Attorneys for Martin's family, however, called the apology a self-serving act by a man facing a life prison sentence if convicted of the second-degree murder charge against him. ""This was the most disingenuous, insulting thing I've ever seen,"" said Martin family attorney Natalie Jackson. Martin's parents were ""completely devastated"" over the decision to allow Zimmerman to post bond and eventually go free, attorney Benjamin Crump said. Prosecutors had asked that Zimmerman remain in jail without bond or that Judge Kenneth R. Lester Jr. set bond at $1 million -- an amount O'Mara said the family would be unable to handle. Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda said Zimmerman's prior run-ins with a police officer and a woman who named him in a domestic violence injunction show that he is violent and a threat to the community. Lester, however, described the incidents as ""run of the mill"" and ""somewhat mild"" in approving O'Mara's request for bond. With the 10% cash payment customarily made to secure bond, Zimmerman could be freed with $15,000 from his family, attorneys said. He will likely remain in jail for at least a couple of days while his attorneys and authorities work out terms of his release, which also include electronic monitoring and other restrictions, O'Mara said. The judge told O'Mara to talk to authorities about his request to allow Zimmerman to leave Florida while awaiting trial. O'Mara said he is concerned about threats to Zimmerman's safety, as well as that of his family. De la Rionda said no decision has been made on whether to allow Zimmerman to leave the state. The decision to grant Zimmerman bond followed a hearing in which his wife and parents testified that he was a caring, nonviolent man. ""I know that he is very protective of people, very protective of homeless people and also of children,"" Gladys Zimmerman testified by telephone. She said her son helped organize a campaign to ""get justice"" for a homeless man who had been beaten in Sanford, where he lived and where the shooting of Martin took place. He also ventured into a dangerous Orlando neighborhood twice a week to mentor a 14-year-old African-American boy, his mother said. She testified that she begged him not to go because of the danger. ""He said, 'Mom, if I don't go, they don't have nobody,' "" she said. HLN: Zimmerman wife talks publicly for the first time . Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman Sr., testified that his son is not a violent man despite previous incidents discussed by de la Rionda during the hearing, including a scuffle with a police officer and a dispute with a woman. ""I've never known him to be violent at all unless he was provoked, and then he would turn the other cheek,"" Robert Zimmerman testified. According to authorities, Zimmerman has said he killed Martin in self-defense after the teenager accosted him, knocking him to the ground and bashing his head against the concrete. Zimmerman's father testified Friday that when he saw his son the day after Martin's shooting, he was wearing a protective cover over his nose, his face was swollen, and he had two vertical gashes on his head. He also reportedly suffered a broken nose. Timeline of case . Martin's family and the special prosecutor appointed to investigate the case have rejected that argument, saying they believe Zimmerman disobeyed the instructions of a police dispatcher to stop following Martin, racially profiled him and unjustly killed him. Although details of the shooting remain murky, what is known is that Martin ventured out from the home of his father's fiancee in Sanford and went to a nearby convenience store, where he bought a bag of Skittles and an Arizona Iced Tea. On his way back, he had a confrontation with Zimmerman, who shot him. Zimmerman had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood, according to authorities. In the call, Zimmerman said he was following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman pursued Martin anyway. After briefly losing track of the teen, Zimmerman told authorities the teen approached him and the two exchanged words. Zimmerman said he reached for his cell phone, then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him down and began slamming his head onto the sidewalk, leading to the shooting. Florida to review 'stand your ground' law . Police have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there was no evidence to disprove his account that he had acted in self-defense. A police report indicated he was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head. In Friday's hearing, an investigator for special prosecutor Angela Corey's office said authorities have no evidence showing who started the altercation that led to Martin's death. ""Do I know? No,"" investigator Dale Gilbreath said when asked if he knew who started the fight. He said wounds on the back of Zimmerman's head were consistent with his skull being struck with something harder than his skull, and said under questioning from O'Mara that the object could have been a concrete sidewalk. But he said evidence in the case is not consistent with Zimmerman's account that he was able to move away from the sidewalk just before being shot. Martin was shot once in the chest at close range, Gilbreath said. De la Rionda declined to comment on most of Friday's proceedings, including Zimmerman's testimony. But he said there's more to come when the case comes to trial. ""We obviously have evidence we feel we can go forward with,"" he said. ""We did not put our entire case on today."" Crump said Martin's father, Tracy Martin, wept through much of Friday hearing, and the family was distraught at the prospect of Zimmerman being able to reunite with his family. ""They pray that his freedom is only temporary, because the pain he has caused this family is going to be permanent,"" Crump said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- In an expanding investigation into teacher misconduct, Los Angeles school officials are going back 40 years in their internal review of teacher discipline cases in an effort to determine whether any of the instructors should also be referred for possible license revocation, a school spokesman said Friday. Los Angeles School Superintendent John Deasy has asked the principals at more than 1,000 schools to search the files of the past 40 years for ""any cases of possible employee misconduct,"" spokesman Tom Waldman told CNN. The 40-year period is a significant expansion from the past four years of misconduct cases that the system has already reviewed. So far, Los Angeles school officials have referred the discipline cases of 604 teachers from the past four years to state authorities who have powers to revoke a teacher's credentials, officials said. Of those 604 cases in which teachers were fired or facing discipline, 60 teachers were accused of sexual misconduct with pupils on or off campus or with minors who weren't students, school officials said. The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing will investigate 366 of the 604 teacher cases to determine if licenses should be revoked, which is a six-month process, spokeswoman Anne Padilla said. Most of the cases focused on allegations of teacher misconduct that involved student safety. Padilla said Friday that 122 of the 604 cases were referred back to the school district for further information because the state agency didn't have the authority to investigate. She also told CNN that 103 of the 604 cases were duplicates and were already being investigated by the agency's committee on credentials. ""For the vast majority, no final action has been taken. They are still in process,"" Padilla said about the 103 cases. The referral of the cases to state licensing investigators comes as the nation's second largest school system deals with a crisis of teacher misconduct. The district has been reeling from a scandal at Miramonte Elementary School, where two teachers have been charged with lewd acts on pupils, including one teacher accused of putting children in adult-like bondage situations and placing semen-filled spoons at their mouths. The state license of that teacher, Mark Berndt -- who has pleaded not guilty to 23 counts of lewd acts on pupils -- has been suspended as the state agency monitors his criminal case, and a license revocation occurs upon a conviction, Padilla said. If an appeal to a conviction is made, the suspension of teaching credentials continues, Padilla said. This week, the California Senate approved a bill that would empower school boards to fire teachers for misconduct and expedite the firing process of instructors accused of offenses involving sex, violence or drugs, said Democratic state Sen. Alex Padilla, who authored the legislation. The bill now goes to the State Assembly for a vote. ""Because a school board is ultimately responsible for ensuring a safe learning environment, the school board should be empowered to dismiss employees they determine to be a serious threat to the health and safety of students,"" Sen. Padilla said in a statement. The lurid allegations at Miramonte prompted the Los Angeles system to do an internal review of its handling of past teacher misconduct cases, and the district determined that 604 cases needed to be referred to state licensing authorities for review, though ""a substantial number"" of other misconduct cases had already been reported to the state, school officials said. One parent, Alvaro Salgero, told CNN that he was concerned about child abuse in the school system. ""It tended to be a safe place, but from what I hear, it seems that's not happening in some places,"" Salgero said. ""There isn't sufficient security for children. ""We're able to realize that there wasn't much of an investigation with teachers and they didn't investigate them before giving them a job, and those who suffer are the children, the pupils,"" Salgero said. The 604 cases include teachers who were disciplined or were about to face discipline since July 2008, according to Ira Berman, Los Angeles Unified School District director of employee relations, and Vivian Ekchian, the district's chief human resources officer. The cases also include teachers who were fired by the school board or who left the district after termination proceedings were initiated or while an allegation of misconduct was pending, Berman and Ekchian said. The system doesn't know whether any of the teachers who were fired or who left the district are still in the classroom in other school districts. The 604 figure also includes teachers who were suspended for 11 days or more for a variety of reasons not involving sexual misconduct with students, the two officials said. ""The safety of our students is our No. 1 priority,"" Ekchian said in explaining why the system referred the 604 cases to the state. The system's internal investigation arose after parental outrage after charges were filed against former Miramonte teacher Berndt, who resigned from the system last year but was not referred to the state for possible license revocation, district spokesman Waldman said. Berndt, 61, pleaded not guilty in February to allegations he bound young students, then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and three-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces, among other graphic depictions. ""We had not informed Sacramento to revoke Mr. Berndt's credentials,"" Waldman said. Berndt is being held on $23 million bond and faces 23 counts of lewd acts on a child. The 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. Authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by Berndt in his classroom. Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Deasy has said Berndt was removed from his teaching job in January 2011 after school officials learned of the police investigation. A teacher for 30 years, Berndt initially challenged the school district's decision to dismiss him. But he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned last spring. His arrest in January led to broader fallout over the adequacy of safeguards for the school's students and the prospect of more victims. Days after Berndt was taken into custody, another Miramonte Elementary teacher -- Martin Springer, 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl younger than 14. He has pleaded not guilty. The LAUSD board subsequently shut Miramonte for two days, during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400-student school. Miramonte is in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about six miles south of downtown Los Angeles.","Los Angeles school officials are now going back 40 years in their review of past teacher misconduct .

"(CNN) -- A Philadelphia judge sentenced a faith healing couple to up to seven years in state prison Wednesday for failing to seek medical care for their 7-month-old son, who died last year. Catherine and Herbert Schaible turned to prayer rather than medicine to treat their son Brandon, who died in April from bacterial pneumonia, dehydration and strep, according to the district attorney's office. The pneumonia and strep are treatable with antibiotics. The couple were sentenced to 3Â½ to seven years at the Criminal Justice Center in Center City. The Schaibles are lifelong members of the First Century Gospel Church in Philadelphia, one of several religious groups in the U.S. that believes God alone heals the sick. ""Catherine is a completely devoted mother.

"(CNN) -- Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair -- once one of the U.S. Army's top commanders in Afghanistan and accused of ""sodomy ... by force"" and other military crimes -- is to set to plead guilty Thursday to some charges but not the most serious levied against him, his lawyer said. Sinclair will plead guilty on three of the eight charges he's facing in military court, according to the office of lawyer Richard Scheff. These include ""wrongfully engaging in ... inappropriate relationships"" with three women soldiers from 2009 to 2012 overseas in Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany as well as domestically at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Hood, Texas. He'll also admit to having requested and possessed ""pornographic and sexually explicit photographs and movies,"" having ""sexually explicit communications with a female Army captain, and trying ""to engage in an inappropriate relationship"" with another woman. And the brigadier general will plead guilty to impeding the investigation into him by deleting nude photographs and an e-mail account, his lawyer said. Army general faces sexual conduct, other charges . But Sinclair will not admit to the most serious accusations against him, including the sodomy charge and that he threatened ""to kill (one of the soldiers) and her family if she told anyone about their relationship, or words to that effect."" He is also charged with ""using his rank and authority to coerce and compel"" a woman ""subject to his orders ... to maintain a sexual relationship with him and prevent her from ending (that) relationship."" ""The government now has a big problem: It took pathetically weak assault charges and put a fancy wrapper around them,"" Scheff said. ""We just tore the wrapper off. The prosecution team no longer gets to distract us with salacious details about acts that aren't even criminal in the civilian world."" Yet Sinclair could still be found guilty on all the charges against him. It's up to a military judge to accept the guilty pleas as is, though Scheff's office indicates that they expect he'll do so. Moreover, the full trial is still set to proceed as planned with opening arguments kicking off at some point Thursday. Sinclair was sent to Fort Bragg from Afghanistan in 2012, the same year the last alleged incidents occurred and when he was originally charged.

"(CNN) -- On the holiday that celebrates the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., many will remember his sacrifices for the civil rights movement, and serve others in his memory. Because of the accolades he received after his martyrdom, King is often viewed as a charismatic leader who was responsible for the success of the campaign for civil rights reform. But many forget his international outlook, including protest of the war in Vietnam. And history reveals that before he was a civil rights leader he was, first, a preacher, committed to social and economic justice. He was only reluctantly a civil rights leader. The greatest MLK speeches you never heard . Rosa Parks transformed King into that leader. Chosen to lead the Montgomery bus boycott movement, he quickly gained prominence as the nation's best-known civil rights spokesperson and advocate of Gandhian nonviolent resistance to the Southern Jim Crow system. But during the six years after the boycott's successful conclusion, he never planned and carried out a campaign of civil disobedience. In 1963, King finally had an opportunity to play a leading role in sustained protests in Birmingham. But even in this campaign to pressure local leaders on the city's segregation, he came perilously close to failure. By early April 1963, his support among local black leaders had declined, and despite initial enthusiasm of the first mass protests, it became clear that he would not be able to recruit many more protesters willing to engage in civil disobedience through clashes with the forces of Police Chief Bull Conner. As Easter neared, King realized that bail funds were depleted, and few adult activists were prepared to spend long periods in jail. Even Ralph Abernathy and some of his other colleagues were unwilling to risk arrest if this meant being unavailable to deliver Easter Sunday sermons in their churches. When he made a critical, solitary decision -- his ""faith act"" -- to submit to arrest on Good Friday, King was not certain that this decision would result in a successful outcome in Birmingham. Many of his advisers, including his father, had tried to dissuade him from going to jail. ""I don't know what will happen or what the outcome will be,"" he had admitted to the close associates who gathered in Birmingham's Gaston Motel. After he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement, he remembered enduring ""the longest, most frustrating and bewildering hours I have lived."" King regained his confidence only after he learned from his lawyer, Clarence Jones, that entertainer Harry Belafonte had raised $50,000 and promised to raise more to provide bail for those willing to go to jail. When a group of local white clergymen denounced the Birmingham protests as ""unwise and untimely,"" King responded with the letter from his jail cell that would become the most influential defense of civil disobedience since Thoreau's essay on the subject more than a century earlier. But King's letter also expressed a philosophical commitment to nonviolent direct action that he had never previously translated into a nonviolent direction action campaign. King was not able to revive the Birmingham campaign until he allowed himself to be bailed out of jail and gave in to the urging of James Bevel, Dorothy Cotton, and other activists that he allow eager teenagers to participate in marches into Birmingham's downtown area, and thereby reinvigorate the flagging protest movement in Birmingham. When Conner responded with fire hoses and police dogs, the clashes in downtown Birmingham attracted the world's attention. In Birmingham, as had been the case in other communities, the courageous actions of young people demonstrated the effectiveness of King's ideas more than the actions of King himself. Due to the timely intervention of thousands of young people, King was able to secure a settlement with Birmingham's white business leaders. He could then claim victory rather than suffer an ignominious defeat. King's success in Birmingham marked a major turning point in his life. If he had failed, it is unlikely that he would have been invited to deliver the concluding speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It his even more unlikely that he would he have been given more time than the other speakers that day to share his dream that would enter the nation's collective consciousness. King's most important contribution to the modern African-American freedom struggle was as an eloquent proponent of civil disobedience, and as a visionary who understood the broader global and historical significance of the African-American civil rights movement. His oratory inspired participants in mass movements that were usually initiated and sustained by others. The Southern freedom struggle certainly would have eventually achieved major civil rights reforms even after a setback in Birmingham, but it is very doubtful whether we would be talking about King today if he had failed in Birmingham in 1963.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Wednesday she does not regret her interview with Katie Couric of CBS and wishes she had been more available to the media during the campaign. Gov. Sarah Palin says she will support President-elect Barack Obama and his new administration. ""I should have done it, yes. And her questions were fair,"" Palin told CNN's Larry King Wednesday. ""Obviously being a bit annoyed with some of the questions, my annoyance shows through."" Palin had some well-publicized fumbles during interviews with Couric in late September leading up to her vice presidential debate. ""Certainly I should have done the interview. And to attribute I think that interview to any kind of negativity in the campaign or a downfall in the campaign, I think it's ridiculous."" Palin added she wished she talked more to the media. ""In retrospect, in hindsight, I wish I would had more opportunities or that we would have seized more opportunities to speak more,"" Palin said. In two interviews with CNN Wednesday, Palin reflected upon her unsuccessful bid for the White House and discussed President-elect Barack Obama's incoming administration. The Alaska governor said she would be honored to help out Obama and his new administration -- even though he did hang around with an ""unrepentant domestic terrorist"" -- if he asked her for assistance on issues she highlighted her campaign, such as energy or services for special-needs children. ""It would be my honor to assist and support our new president and the new administration,"" said Palin, whom Sen. John McCain chose as his running mate in August.  Watch CNN's Wolf Blitzer interview Palin » . When asked about some of the tough rhetoric she hurled from the stump, she said she was ""still concerned"" about Obama's ties to former Weather Underground member-turned-Chicago college professor William Ayers. ""If anybody still wants to talk about it, I will,"" she said. ""Because this is an unrepentant domestic terrorist who had campaigned to blow up, to destroy our Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol.  Watch Palin talk about Ayers » . ""That's an association that still bothers me, and I think it's fair to still talk about it,"" she continued. ""However, the campaign is over. That chapter is closed. Now is the time to move on and make sure all of us are doing all that we can to progress this nation.""  Watch Palin discuss how she could help Obama » .

There's speculation that Palin, as well as other incumbent governors at the conference such as Charlie Crist of Florida, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, could all have designs on the Republican presidential nomination in the next race for the White House. All three governors were on McCain's list of possible running mates before he selected Palin. As the 2012 buzz takes off, a new poll suggests that just less than half of all Americans have a favorable view of Palin. Forty-nine percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday have a favorable opinion of Palin, with 43 percent viewing her unfavorably.

""In early September, just after the GOP convention, her favorable rating among registered voters was 57 percent, and only a quarter of all registered voters had an unfavorable view of her,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""Palin is less popular than Vice President-elect Joe Biden, with a 64 percent favorable rating, or her boss on the GOP ticket during the just-completed campaign, John McCain, who is seen favorably by 61 percent of the public."" The poll also suggests men have a slightly more positive view of Palin than women, with 51 percent of males viewing her favorably, 3 percentage points higher than female respondents.

"Washington (CNN) -- What is the state of Congress today? How about a public shouting match at a committee hearing, with Republican Chairman Darrell Issa then cutting off the microphones while the top Democrat sought to make a statement. After the unseemly theatrics Wednesday, Issa conceded that a nearly year-long investigation of Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups may be approaching what he called a ""dead end."" ""It may well be that we have gotten to the bottom of it,"" Issa told reporters after former IRS manager Lois Lerner again refused to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by invoking her Fifth Amendment rights. An aide to Issa said the committee chairman had yet to decide on whether to pursue contempt charges against Lerner. Such uncertainty raises questions about whether Republicans who have alleged the targeting order came from political higher-ups, even the White House, can win a legal battle to compel Lerner to provide testimony. ""Without that, it may dead end with Ms. Lerner,"" Issa said of the probe. Republicans contend the IRS targeted groups seeking tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny for political reasons, because organizations with names that included ""tea party"" and other conservative-themed words and phrases got screened. The IRS, the Obama administration and Democrats reject any political motivation, noting that liberal groups also came under extra scrutiny because of their names. Lerner, who was put on administrative leave and then retired last year from the IRS, headed the unit that did the screening. So far, she has refused to testify before Congress on the matter, and did so again Wednesday before the panel chaired by Issa. The move infuriated Issa, who has led a Republican investigation that so far has failed to find any political motivation behind the targeting. Issa adjourned Wednesday's session over the objections of Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who shouted back that the chairman's actions were ""absolutely un-American."" As Cummings demanded to be heard, Issa declared, ""We've adjourned,"" and signaled to the committee to cut the microphones by running the edge of his hand across his throat. Cummings continued, speaking loudly because of the lack of amplification. ""I am a member of the Congress of the United States of America. I am tired of this,"" Cummings yelled. ""You cannot just have a one-sided investigation. There is absolutely something wrong with that."" Afterward, Issa told reporters that the purpose of the hearing was to see if Lerner would waive her Fifth Amendment rights and answer questions. When it became clear she would not, there was no reason to continue, the chairman from California said. ""Mr. Cummings did not raise a point of privilege or a point or order,"" Issa said, noting that he initially recognized Cummings for a question. ""He went into an opening statement. Opening statements had already been completed."" Pressed further, Issa said he had the microphones cut because Cummings continued to talk during ""an adjourned meeting."" ""He was actually slandering me at the moment that the mics did go off by claiming that this had not been a real investigation,"" Issa complained. To Cummings, the issue involved allowing Democrats on the panel to have a say. ""We were basically shut out completely,"" he told reporters, criticizing Issa and Republicans for repeatedly distorting the panel's findings through ""cherry picking information, of sending just a few lines from various transcripts.""","NEW: Chairman Issa says his investigation needs testimony from former IRS official .

"Washington (CNN) -- A March 16 referendum on whether the Crimea Peninsula should rejoin Russia has become the focus of the Ukraine crisis. Like nearly every aspect of the conflict, the vote planned by Crimea's regional parliament evokes widely differing interpretations of its legitimacy and importance. Here are some of the biggest questions about the issue, with a look at how key players are weighing in: . 1) What is the Crimean referendum? Voters in the autonomous Ukrainian region of about 2 million people will choose between remaining part of the former Soviet territory or becoming part of neighboring Russia. The referendum follows the lightning chain of events in Ukraine in previous weeks that included increasingly violent protests against the government, the country's pro-Russian President fleeing across the border, and then Russian troops seizing what amounts to military control of Crimea -- where Russia's Black Sea fleet is based. By unanimously backing the referendum, the Crimean parliament signaled the intentions of regional leaders as well as Russia to restore the territory to Moscow's control. Ukraine's interim government insists Crimea is part of the country, a stance supported by the United States and its European allies. Disturbing tales emerge from Crimea . 2) Is it legal? Depends on who you ask. In the Ukraine, the interim government rejects the referendum as unconstitutional, while many in the pro-Russian Crimea region desire the chance to again align with Moscow. Russia says the political upheaval in Ukraine that forced out President Viktor Yanukovych ended the Kiev government's constitutional authority. After a phone conversation Thursday between President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said Putin made the point in the call that the ousting of Yanukovych was an ""anti-constitutional coup."" Now, it says, the people of Crimea should have the right to decide their future in the same way as other autonomous regions, such as Kosovo's breakaway from Serbia. Obama, however, declared Thursday that ""the proposed referendum on the future of Crimea would violate the Ukrainian constitution and violate international law."" Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN on Thursday that the Ukrainian constitution requires territorial referendums to be held ""across the entirety of Ukraine and not just in a sub-region like this."" She argued that Yanukovych fled on his own volition, and that constitutional authority agreed to in a February 21 deal he reached with opposition leaders and European envoys remained in effect. Under that agreement, Ukraine will elect a new government on May 25 for the entire country, including Crimea. Russian Parliament backs Crimea vote, brushes off sanctions threat . 3) What would it mean? Obama's quick condemnation of a Crimean referendum showed the United States expects the outcome to favor realigning with Russia. The autonomous region has a 60% ethnic Russian population, having been part of Russia until it was ceded to Ukraine in 1954 by the Soviet Union. While it would still remain an autonomous region in theory, Crimea would effectively come under the direct influence of Russia once again. Power said that if the referendum goes forward, the result would get little recognition beyond Russia. That didn't matter in 2008 when Russia under Putin sent troops into neighboring Georgia, another former Soviet territory, to back autonomy for the pro-Russian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. More than five years later, both territories effectively annexed with Russian forces still present. Asked if Crimea and perhaps other parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that favor Russia might end up the same, Power said: ""I think it's maybe not helpful to talk about precedents."" ""We are seeking to create a future where the past is not replicated here in Ukraine, and the broad unity of the international community I think is impressive and formidable,"" she added. Cyberwar hits Ukraine . 4) Potential fallout? For Russia, the motivation is ensuring control of its Black Sea fleet based in Sevastopol as well as its economic influence in Ukraine and other former Soviet territories and satellites. The Crimean referendum would provide an electoral justification for what amounts to a land grab amid Ukraine's political upheaval. Obama acknowledged Russia had legitimate concerns that needed to be part of a solution, such as guarantees it could maintain the Sevastopol-based naval fleet in Ukraine. However, his call for Russian troops in Crimea to return to barracks and negotiations between Russia and Ukraine on a solution has so far yielded little progress. Both the United States and European Union have threatened sanctions if no significant progress occurs soon, but major economic ties between Russia and European powers such as Germany raise questions about the strength of any EU steps. CNN's Fareed Zakaria said Putin may get his wish with Crimea, but at a cost. ""They got Crimea, but they've scared off Ukraine,"" he said. ""And, most importantly, the people of Ukraine are now deeply suspicious of Russia. The people in Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic, or probably in places like Kazakhstan, are all now fearful."" CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Russia backs a Crimea-only vote about joining it or staying with Ukraine .
The United States and its European allies say such a referendum is illegal .
To Russia, the ousting of the elected Ukraine government was illegal .
At issue is whether constitutional authority exists in Ukraine ."

"(CNN) -- Back in 1971, I was present as top leaders of two political organizations met to negotiate common actions they could take despite their differences. One of those leaders was a woman. Over and over, she raised points for consideration, only to be ignored by both sides. When someone of the other team did agree with a proposal she made, he would wait a few minutes and then say so to one of her male colleagues, as though the suggestion had been his. ""As you said, Jerry,"" or ""That's probably the way to go, Sam."" No one on her team corrected the misattribution, though they laughed about it afterward. As the woman matter-of-factly explained to me, ""He couldn't admit anything we said was right if he also had to admit that it had come from a woman."" How far have we come in 40 years? According to a new book on the the Obama administration, many of the president's advisers initially showed similar disregard for women. For the first two years, senior female aides complained that male colleagues ignored them, excluded them from key policy meetings, dismissed their opinions and limited their access to the president. It is clear, however, that we have come a long way. When told of the women's concerns, President Barack Obama convened a dinner with the female staff and took steps to make the atmosphere more inclusive and empowering. Our nation now has three women on the Supreme Court, all of whom out-talk at least one of their male colleagues. And we have a female secretary of state who by all accounts does not get muscled aside by anyone, male or female. Assessing the extent and impact of gender stereotypes is more complex today than it was in the early 1960s. Back then, ""head and master"" laws gave husbands the final say in most family decisions. Quotas limited the number of women who could be admitted to law or dental school. ""Help wanted"" ads for men only excluded women from even applying for most highly paid and challenging jobs. And of course, men and women in the same jobs were treated differently in salary and promotions. Women now earn more B.A.'s and M.A.'s than men do, and they have pulled even in Ph.D's. Today, education trumps gender in determining pay, with the result that in most metropolitan regions women in their 20s tend to out-earn men in the same age group because of their greater educational achievement. By contrast, in 1970, a female college graduate who worked full-time year-round earned less than a white male high school graduate. As President Obama's senior staff discovered, gender stereotypes still encourage men to dominate and females to defer, perpetuating women's second-class status in the workforce. Yet these same stereotypes can also penalize males in ways that were not obvious in the past, when male privilege had so many more legal and administrative supports. The mystique of masculinity, for example, encourages many men to view studying hard as ""a girl thing."" It also leads many to seek work in the unstable, seasonal construction sector or in other ""manly"" jobs, many of which are concentrated in declining industries, rather than preparing themselves for ""traditionally female"" jobs in health care, child care, teaching, and social work.""Manly"" males bully other males who show interest in such work, accusing them of acting ""gay"" or being ""girlie-men."" And when men defy these stereotypes to seek such work, they often encounter gender discrimination from employers who believe that a man cannot be as good a nurturer or helper as a woman. But at the top of the educational, economic, and political pyramid -- in what were traditionally ""male"" kinds of work -- gender stereotypes continue to penalize women. Catalyst, an organization formed in 1962 to help women enter the workplace, titled its 2007 report on the attitudes of more than 1,200 senior executives in the United States and Europe toward female employees: ""Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don't."" According to their report, when women ""act assertively, focus on work tasks, display ambition,"" or engage in other behaviors that receive high praise when done by men, they are perceived as ""too tough"" and ""unfeminine."" But when women pay attention to work relationships and express ""concern for other people's perspective,"" they are considered less competent than men. In the television news industry, two-thirds of the news producers, but only 20 percent of the news directors, are female. Men make up more than three-quarters of all workers earning more than $100,000 a year, and only 2 percent of Fortune 500 companies are run by women. Part of this pattern may stem from women's socialization not to put themselves forward too much. Young women are four times less likely than young men to negotiate their first salary, and economists estimate that this unwillingness to assert their own worth as workers ends up costing women $500,000 in earnings by the time they reach 60. But part of the problem is that women's worth is consistently undervalued by others. A March 2010 study by the American Association of University Women found that among postdoctoral applicants, women had to publish three more papers in the most prestigious journals, or 20 more in the less-prestigious ones, to be considered as productive as male applicants. And it remains true that many men are still socialized to put themselves forward too much, and literally cannot hear women who ask for what they want. A wise executive -- in a school, a business, or a nation -- must help his or her team learn to respect all styles of self-presentation and to listen to all views, as Obama evidently did when it was brought to his attention. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Coontz.","Stephanie Coontz: In 1971 she watched as a man took credit for a woman's idea at a meeting .

"(CNN) -- From a distance, Russia is looking awfully good the last few days. First, we learned that members of the art group Pussy Riot would be released from prison under a new amnesty, then that the Arctic 30, a group of Greenpeace activists who spent two months in Russian jails, would be free to go. And finally, President Vladimir Putin announced he would pardon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the country's best-known and longest-serving political prisoner. Inside the country, things look a little different. A majority of the people facing the largest political trial in more than half a century, stemming from a May 6, 2012, anti-Putin protest, will remain behind bars, as will Khodorkovsky's business partner, friend and co-defendant, Platon Lebedev. Sending different messages to the international and domestic audiences is precisely the point of Putin's latest maneuverings and of many of his policies generally. In an effort to make sure that the Olympic Games in Sochi in February go off smoothly, Putin is showing a friendly face to the West, demonstrating that he has heard the criticism directed at him. To the audience at home, the message is, protest and disobedience will be punished harshly. The stability of a democratic society depends in large part on its courts being perceived as just. Dictatorships, on the other hand, need their judicial systems to inspire fear. Nothing inspires fear like the arbitrary, selective application of laws. Consider the Bolotnaya case, in which 27 people have been charged in connection with a protest that ended in violence -- mostly police violence -- last year. Because they face a variety of charges, only eight will be amnestied, and the rest will remain under arrest. But there is no discernible difference among the defendants in this case -- all the charges against them appear unproven and unprovable. This is the very definition of the arbitrary application of laws. To be frightening, punishment must also be harsh. Four of the Bolotnaya case defendants were released December 19. One of them has lost his eyesight in the time he spent in jail; the others merely -- merely -- lost a year and a half of their lives, when they could not see their families or work to support them. At best, as punishment for taking part in a peaceful protest, they have had their careers interrupted and have run up back-breaking debt; at worst, they have sustained irreparable damage to their health. And they are the lucky ones. The two members of Pussy Riot are lucky to get out of jail about two months before their time would have been up. They have spent more than 650 days in jail -- more than a third of each of their children's lives -- as punishment for 40 seconds of lip-syncing in a church. At least one of them, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, has been subjected to physical violence, sleep deprivation and chronic undernourishment. Both have sustained long and debilitating hunger strikes. Tolokonnikova said that when she tried to speak out about conditions of her custody, prison officials threatened to beat her. Prison officials denied the allegations. But they've had it easy compared to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who once dared challenge Putin on the subject of corruption. For this, and for his general refusal to be subjugated, he spent more than 10 years behind bars. During this time, Khodorkovsky refused, on principle, to discuss the conditions in which he was held, because they were no worse than that which hundreds of thousands of Russia's other convicts faced, but the details that have emerged are harrowing. More or less every time Khodorkovsky gave an interview or published a piece of his own writing -- and he refused to be silenced in jail -- he was confined to punitive solitary. Other than that, he has faced the standard fate of a Russian convicted felon: His life's work has been ruined by the state, his children have grown up without him, and his parents have faced old age and life-threatening illness without him. For Putin, punishment -- no matter how harsh -- is not complete if it does not include humiliation. Over the years, he consistently said that he would not pardon Khodorkovsky unless Khodorkovsky admitted his guilt. On December 19 he stated that Khodorkovsky had appealed for clemency, and Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, added that the appeal included an admission of guilt. Khodorkovsky himself, speaking from Germany, has said that ""the issue of admission of guilt was not raised"" in the discussion. But that did not stop Putin from using the occasion of his release to communicate yet again to the Russian people that not only will he punish his enemies -- he will not stop until they are finally subjugated. There is reason to believe that Khodorkovsky was forced to accept emigration as a condition of being released from prison. It would behoove the international community â€” including the 18 countries whose now-amnestied citizens were kidnapped in international waters in September and thrown into Russian jails for two months -- the Greenpeace activists â€” to pay attention to the message Putin is sending. His mercy is heavily conditional, while his fury is severe -- and his disregard for legality, close to complete. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Masha Gessen.","Vladimir Putin pardoned Mikhail Khodorkovsky ahead of the 2014 Olympics .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A federal judge on Thursday threw out an author's claims that Jessica Seinfeld, the comedian's wife, plagiarized from her cookbook, but the judge left open claims of defamation against Jerry Seinfeld himself. Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld attend an event in New York City in June. ""This is a complete victory for Jessica Seinfeld,"" said Orin Snyder, Seinfeld's lawyer. Snyder said U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain dismissed all claims brought against Jessica Seinfeld's cookbook, ""Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food."" In the lawsuit, filed in 2007, author Missy Chase Lapine accused Jessica Seinfeld of taking ideas from Lapine's cookbook ""The Sneaky Chef: Simple Strategies for Hiding Healthy Foods in Kids' Favorite Meals."" Lapine's cookbook was published in April 2007, six months before Seinfeld's book. ""The court categorically rejected the claim that 'Deceptively Delicious' infringed the copyright and trademark of the plaintiff's book,"" Snyder said. ""The federal judge ruled that 'no reasonable fact finder could conclude' that copying occurred here given that the works are 'very different' and that Jessica's book 'has a completely different feel.' "" But Lapine's lawyer, Howard B. Miller, said his client may appeal the dismissal of her copyright and trademark claims, and will refile in state court claims against Jerry Seinfeld. Lapine's defamation claims against the comedian refer to a comment he made on the ""Late Show with David Letterman"" in 2007, when he compared the fact that Lapine uses three names to the fact that assassins sometimes use three names, as was the case with Lee Harvey Oswald. ""The claims against Jerry Seinfeld for defamation are still fully alive,"" Miller said. ""He just says he is joking; we don't think calling someone an assassin and a wacko is a joke."" ""I'm up against a very powerful opponent,"" Lapine said in a telephone interview from her home in Westchester County, New York. ""Justice is not always served."" Lapine, a 45-year-old mother of two, said she has gone on to publish two other books, all in the ""Sneaky Chef"" series.","Cookbook writer alleged that Jessica Seinfeld plagiarized .

"Washington (CNN) -- Longtime White House reporter Helen Thomas has retired effective immediately, Hearst Corporation said Monday. The media conglomerate had employed Thomas as a syndicated columnist for its newspaper chain. Her retirement comes amid a furor created last week by her controversial comments regarding Jewish people. Thomas, 89, was considered the dean of the White House press corps, as she was the longest-serving White House journalist. She has been reporting on administrations since 1960, when she began covering then-President-elect John F. Kennedy and his family. Thomas, had come under fire late last week when a YouTube video surfaced showing her saying that Israel should ""get the hell out of Palestine,"" and that the Jewish people should go home to ""Poland, Germany ... and America and everywhere else."" In a posting on her website Friday, Thomas apologized for her remarks. ""They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon,"" she wrote. But the apology was not enough to silence critics, who began a rising chorus of calls for Thomas either to be terminated or suspended by Hearst. Just prior to Hearst's announcement, the board of the White House Correspondents Association released a statement condemning Thomas' remarks. The group of White House reporters, which includes CNN's Ed Henry, called Thomas' remarks ""indefensible."" The reporters' statement said, ""Many in our profession who have known Helen for years were saddened by the comments, which were especially unfortunate in light of her role as a trailblazer on the White House beat."" And during a Monday morning briefing, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs also criticized Thomas, saying, ""Those remarks were offensive and reprehensible. I think she should and has apologized because obviously those remarks do not reflect the -- certainly the opinion of, I assume, most of the people in here and certainly not of the administration."" On Sunday, former White House Counsel Lanny Davis was among those calling for Hearst to take action against Thomas. She was also dropped by her agent, Nine Speakers Inc., on Sunday, and Craig Crawford, who co-authored ""Listen Up, Mr. President"" with Thomas, said in a blog post that he ""will no longer be working with Helen on our book projects."" Thomas, who is of Lebanese descent, made the comments to Rabbi David Nesenoff of Rabbilive.com, who told CNN his hand-held camera was in plain sight on May 27 when he asked her for ""Any comments on Israel?"" ""Tell them to get the hell out of Palestine,"" she responded. ""Any better comments on Israel?"" Nesenoff asked. Thomas replied, ""Remember, these people are occupied and it's their land, it's not German. It's not Poland."" Nesenoff asked where the Jews should go, and Thomas responded, ""They should go home,"" which the White House reporter identified as ""Poland, Germany ... and America and everywhere else."" ""This is a story about the power of video,"" Nesenoff said Monday. ""This issue was anti-Semitism, within 24 hours over a million views, we find out that someone who's been reporting for 60 years, this is what she's about."" The rabbi said Thomas' website statement wasn't enough and that she owes the Jewish community an apology. ""My initial reaction is she can retire from her job but she can't retire from her responsibility to apologize for her comments,"" Nesenoff said. ""There's a difference between telling your opinion and giving someone the finger, which is what she did."" The Anti-Defamation League said in a written statement that Thomas' apology ""does not go far enough."" ""Her remarks were outrageous, offensive and inappropriate,"" ADL national director Abraham H. Foxman said in the statement. ""Her suggestion that Israelis should go back to Poland and Germany is bigoted and shows a profound ignorance of history. We believe Thomas needs to make a more forceful and sincere apology for the pain her remarks have caused."" Her apology also was not enough for Davis, who served as special counsel to former President Bill Clinton. ""Helen Thomas, who I used to consider a close friend and who I used to respect, has showed herself to be an anti-Semitic bigot,"" Davis said. ""This is not about her disagreement about her criticisms of Israel. She has a right to criticize Israel and that is not the same as being an anti-Semite."" Davis added, ""If she had asked all blacks to go back to Africa, what would the White House Correspondents Association position be as to whether she deserved White House press room credentials -- much less a privileged honorary seat?"" Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary for former President George W. Bush, also said Thomas should be fired because of her remarks. He reiterated that demand in a statement provided to CNN Sunday. ""Helen's statement calling for the religious cleansing of Israel is reprehensible,"" Fleischer said. ""If this isn't bigotry, what is? What she said is as bad as someone saying all blacks should leave America and go back to Africa."" ""Hearst Newspapers should do the right thing and let Helen go,"" Fleischer added in the statement. CNN's Kiran Khalid contributed to this report.","NEW: Rabbi who recorded interview says Thomas was giving Jews ""the finger""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A federal judge on Thursday threw out an author's claims that Jessica Seinfeld, the comedian's wife, plagiarized from her cookbook, but the judge left open claims of defamation against Jerry Seinfeld himself. Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld attend an event in New York City in June. ""This is a complete victory for Jessica Seinfeld,"" said Orin Snyder, Seinfeld's lawyer. Snyder said U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain dismissed all claims brought against Jessica Seinfeld's cookbook, ""Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food."" In the lawsuit, filed in 2007, author Missy Chase Lapine accused Jessica Seinfeld of taking ideas from Lapine's cookbook ""The Sneaky Chef: Simple Strategies for Hiding Healthy Foods in Kids' Favorite Meals."" Lapine's cookbook was published in April 2007, six months before Seinfeld's book. ""The court categorically rejected the claim that 'Deceptively Delicious' infringed the copyright and trademark of the plaintiff's book,"" Snyder said. ""The federal judge ruled that 'no reasonable fact finder could conclude' that copying occurred here given that the works are 'very different' and that Jessica's book 'has a completely different feel.' "" But Lapine's lawyer, Howard B. Miller, said his client may appeal the dismissal of her copyright and trademark claims, and will refile in state court claims against Jerry Seinfeld. Lapine's defamation claims against the comedian refer to a comment he made on the ""Late Show with David Letterman"" in 2007, when he compared the fact that Lapine uses three names to the fact that assassins sometimes use three names, as was the case with Lee Harvey Oswald. ""The claims against Jerry Seinfeld for defamation are still fully alive,"" Miller said. ""He just says he is joking; we don't think calling someone an assassin and a wacko is a joke."" ""I'm up against a very powerful opponent,"" Lapine said in a telephone interview from her home in Westchester County, New York. ""Justice is not always served."" Lapine, a 45-year-old mother of two, said she has gone on to publish two other books, all in the ""Sneaky Chef"" series.","Cookbook writer alleged that Jessica Seinfeld plagiarized .

"(CNN) -- A low-slung skyline. A slate gray sky. Rumbling. Close your eyes. It could be the sound of rolling thunder. Instead, it's another shell falling on a neighborhood in Homs. Photos: Slaughter in Syria . ""You don't know if the rocket is going to come in your living room or in your kitchen,"" said an activist who is being identified only as Danny for his safety. ""Everyone's becoming used to death here."" Blood, he says, has become almost as commonplace as water. Still, the scenes are almost unbelievable. ""I saw really horrible things I've never seen in my life,"" he said. ""Kids in the hospital, a kid with his whole jaw gone. a little girl, a kid, she's 4 years old, she's dead, her sister's 6 years old, she lost her left eye and her mother is in intensive care."" As the world talks about how to respond to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's bloody crackdown on the uprising in his country, opposition activists in the country say his military and security services are engaged in a vicious campaign of destruction meant to wipe out the opposition. Almost nothing, it seems, is off limits, they say -- not shelling, not snipers, not torture. To hear al-Assad tell it, the violence is the work of terrorists, and his troops are martyrs to the state's effort to secure peace. But eyewitness accounts and videos streaming out of Syria on the Internet paint a starkly different picture. Syrian rebel leadership is split . Where state television shows the Syrian president surrounded by clerics in a peaceful prayer, opposition video shows an injured man being hustled into a makeshift medical clinic from the back of a bloody pickup truck, mothers crying in the street. Opinion: Al-Assad missed chance to reform Syria . Where official images depict a cheering crowd waving Syrian and Russian flags during a visit from the Russian foreign minister, opposition video shows crowds of apparently unarmed civilians running through the streets in terror from explosions that blacken and bloody the streets. And where the state-run SANA news agency says armed terrorist gangs are to blame for the violence, activists point to images of children, their bodies studded by shrapnel, running fearfully in rubble-strewn streets or asking, from under thick bandages enveloping a tiny head, what they've done to deserve such violence. Rocket attacks, blood in the streets and fight for freedom . In one video shot by activists, a man cradles the lifeless body of a child. Smoke rises from a shelled building. Gunfire and explosions echo through the streets. Not even the makeshift clinics where people try to help horribly injured civilians are safe. ""They hit one of our field hospitals yesterday,"" the activist identified as Danny told CNN on Monday. ""The doctors died, the patients died."" Snipers and tanks from the Syrian armed forces -- at nearly 400,000 strong, according to the U.S. State Department, one of the largest in the Middle East -- stalk the streets. Barricades keep their quarry from freely moving, according to activists who say day-and-night shelling often hits residential neighborhoods. Homs is not the only target. Troops raided Daraa in April, shortly after the uprising began, according to Syrian opposition groups. They shot indiscriminately, sometimes into homes, opposition activists have said. Significant numbers of deaths have also been reported in Damascus and its suburbs, as well as Deir Ezzor, Aleppo, Idlib, Latakia, and Hama. Throughout the country, government forces have taken over schools and hospitals to use as detention centers and sniper nests, Human Rights Watch reported this week. A father told investigators he stopped allowing his 10-year-old son attend school because of snipers targeting travelers on the road leading to school. ""We called it 'the street of death',"" Human Rights Watch quoted the man as saying. Human rights groups also say security forces have taken and tortured children. ""Children have not been spared the horror of Syria's crackdown. Syrian security forces have killed, arrested, and tortured children in their homes, their schools, or on the streets,"" said Lois Whitman, children's rights director at Human Rights Watch. One former adult detainee said security forces seem to target children for special abuse. ""There is torture, but there is also rape for the boys,"" Human Rights Watch quoted the man as saying. ""We would see them when the guards brought them back to the cell, it's indescribable, you can't talk about it."" While many suffer in detention centers, even more suffer in formerly peaceful neighborhoods.

"(EW.com) -- While rampant speculation on who is or is not in the running for the role of Finnick Odair in ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" continues to set the Internet ablaze, producers have reportedly made their first offer for another pivotal role in the sequel. According to multiple reports, Oscar-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman has been asked to play Plutarch Heavensbee, the new Gamemaker at the Capitol after Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) was creatively executed at the end of The Hunger Games. Plutarch is a far savvier political animal than his predecessor, and he plays a crucial role in the events of Catching Fire. Hoffman just ended a widely acclaimed run playing Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman"" on Broadway, so why not take the summer off and then hop onto one of the biggest movie franchises in Hollywood? Should the deal go through, it will be the first major new role cast in Catching Fire. Director Francis Lawrence is due to begin shooting the film later this fall. Lionsgate had no comment.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- George Lindsey, the actor who portrayed the country-bumpkin mechanic Goober Pyle on ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" died Sunday after a brief illness, his family said. He was 83. Lindsey's funeral is scheduled for Friday afternoon in Nashville. He will be buried in his hometown of Jasper, Alabama, on Saturday, according to the funeral home. Lindsey's character Goober Pyle joined the hit sitcom in 1964 as the cousin of Gomer Pyle, played by Jim Nabors. When the show ended four seasons later, Lindsey continued as Goober for three years on the sequel series ""Mayberry R.F.D."" ""George often told me his fondest memories of his life in show business were the years he spent working on 'The Andy Griffith Show' and 'Mayberry R.F.D.' "" said Andy Griffith. ""They were for me, too."" Co-star Ron Howard remembered Lindsey as ""warm, intelligent and lovable,"" in a post on Twitter. ""He generated lots of laughs & raised a lot of money for Special Olympics,"" Howard tweeted. The Fairfield, Alabama, native never escaped the stereotyping that the Goober Pyle role brought him. Lindsey embraced it for another 20 years as a regular on TV's ""Hee Haw,"" by wearing the familiar hat and clothes of Goober and carried the character on the road for decades of stand-up comedy shows. Lindsey auditioned for the Gomer Pyle role when the show started in 1962, but he was edged out by Nabors, the family's obituary said. When he saw that first episode on TV featuring Nabors as Gomer, he kicked his television screen because he was upset for losing the part. ""Not only that, but now I didn't have a TV to watch 'Ben Casey' on,"" Lindsey wrote in his autobiography. He was finally added to the cast as Goober, eventually taking over the job of running Mayberry's gas station when Gomer joined the Marines with his own spinoff, ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."" Lindsey turned to acting after stints in the U.S. Air Force and as a high school teacher. He studied at the American Theater Wing in New York for two years while working as a comedian in nightclubs and coffeehouses. An agent from the William Morris Agency saw his work and signed him. That representation led to stage roles, including the production of ""All American"" at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre. Lindsey moved to Los Angeles, where his work was mostly in Westerns, such as ""The Rifleman"" and ""Gunsmoke."" He also acted in the ""The Real McCoys,"" ""The Twilight Zone"" and several Disney productions. He was cast in three episodes of ""The Alfred Hitchcock Hour."" An obituary released by the Nashville funeral home handling Lindsey's arrangements said the actor often joked about what he wanted written on his tombstone. ""One choice goes for the joke: 'I told you I was sick.' The other goes for the heart: 'I hope I made you laugh.' "" Lindsey is survived by his son George Lindsey Jr., daughter Camden Jo Lindsey Gardner, and two grandsons.

"(Lonely Planet) -- Life's not always a beach. The Caribbean may win hearts for its white-sand beaches on perfect turquoise coves and high-end villas with moored yachts, but there's another part of the story: its towns. Some have histories that predate the Pilgrims, cobbled centers that gaze out at the water and enough attractions to justify carving a day or two away from those perfect stretches of sand. San Juan, Puerto Rico . Did you know San Juan was nearly 100 when the Mayflower reached the Americas? Reached by frequent, direct (sometimes cheap) flights from the US, the historic Puerto Rican capital is a place that can fill a week's stay easily. The cobblestoned lanes of Old San Juan are filled with cafes, restaurants, hotels and sites including two seriously old forts; most visitors see the six-floor, 16th-century El Morro, but don't overlook the Fuerte San Cristobal, which offers free spooky tunnel tours on weekends. San Juan also has excellent art, free salsa lessons in clubs, fine dining in the ever-emerging SoFo district on Fortaleza St, and excellent beaches below the city walls. For a break from the city pulse, day trip to hike the rainforest at nearby El Yunque. Havana, Cuba . Everyone knows about Havana, but that doesn't mean it's not fantastic. Wandering about the crumbling grandeur of 'Habana Vieja' feels like entering the world of a gritty 1950s movie. Vintage US and Soviet cars trundle past colonial tenements showing their age, and pick-up baseball games played with a stick. Casa de la Musica is what one Lonely Planet author describes as 'hot hot hot salsa with young hot hot hot Cubans'. Locals drink tiny cups of homegrown coffee in a classic coffee house like Café de las Infusiones, fun spots to spend an hour or so. All this doesn't come with lack of comfort. Restored colonial hotels like the Hostal Condes de Villanueva (tel 53-862-9293; Mercaderes No 202), where rooms with stained-glass windows over look a private courtyard. Lonely Planet: How to choose a Caribbean island . Willemstad, Curaçao . A lively Dutch/Caribbean hybrid, the little capital of Curaçao is famed for its historic core -- a UNESCO World Heritage site of two neighborhoods split by a channel. Boutique hotels made from 19th-century buildings (best is Hotel Kura Hulanda) make Willemstad a good base to explore the town's floating markets, atmospheric draw bridges names for Dutch queens, an excellent museum unflinchingly detailing the slave trade, and cafes that look plucked from an Amsterdam backstreet. Beaches are good too. Grab a rental car and find hidden beach coves -- practically isolated -- to the north, along with a peek at Christoffel National Park's plantations. Jacmel, Haiti . Haiti's not for everyone, but as the nation struggles to rebuild after the 2010 earthquake, tourism is starting to pick up and giving a bit of an economic boost to boot. Eighty miles south of the capital Port-au-Prince, Jacmel is a charming town that wasn't as damaged as the capital. It has many Victorian-era buildings from the city's coffee days, superb handicrafts including hand-painted boxes and animal toys, good beaches and a fun day trip to a grotto of cascades and cobalt-blue pools you can reach by horse for $20 or $25. Set in a Victorian mansion, the damaged and rebuilt Hôtel Florita evokes a century-old vibe, with its period furniture and balconies in the rooms. From Port-au-Prince you can bus three hours on good roads to Jacmel. Cockburn Town, Grand Turk, Turks & Caicos . The capital of this multi-island nation, wee Cockburn is home to only 5500 people on an island just six miles long. Cruises dock for a few hours, but the fun rustic place warrants more time. In town, you'll find colorful colonial buildings on narrow streets that still see donkey carts and historic sites, including the spot -- locals claim -- where Christopher Columbus made his first foot-fall of the New World in 1492. Beaches to the north, like Pillory or Corktree, are frequently empty, while the best snorkeling and diving lies to the south (Oasis Divers offers dives or snorkel gear). The best place to stay is the Mediterranean-themed Island House, who offers free use of their car to guests. But on Grand Turk, a bike is really all you need. Lonely Planet: Cracking the Caribbean on a budget . Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic . The Caribbean's largest city, Santo Domingo is a New World firsts-fest. You'll find the hemisphere's first hospital and monastery (lovelier than that might sound), and the oldest surviving fort and cathedral (built by Columbus' son, no less). Its historic center easily fills a couple days of sightseeing before hitting DR's famed beaches. Best is just sitting over a long meal in the strip of outdoor restaurants set up in the 16th century buildings along Plaza España, or getting a drink in the cobbled alley El Conde's bar/café scene. If you go in winter, February's Carnaval is legendary, but just as memorable is catching a baseball game during DR's 48-game winter season from November to February; you'll see major leaguers from the US playing, and seats at the Estadio Quisqueya start at US$6. Roseau, Dominica . The Caribbean's most unique island -- the last to be colonized, the most mountainous of the Eastern islands -- Dominica is sometimes seen as the 'anti-Caribbean', considering its lack of sandy beaches or flashy resorts. Unsurprisingly perhaps, visitors often consider it the friendliest. And because it's so small -- just 29 miles by 16 miles -- you can set up in its lively capital of 1500 residents living in cute stone-and-wood historic homes, Roseau (ROSE-oh) and day trip to waterfalls and open-air hot spring pools in the rainforest, or beaches with snorkeling spots that bubble like champagne from offshore volcanic vents (it's safe). The best day trip involves a tough six-hour hike up to reach the Boiling Lake; it's best done with a guide (Mick Jagger went with Ken's Hinterland Adventure Tours). There are no direct flights outside the region; the best gateways to Dominica are via Antigua, Sint Maarten or Barbados on American Eagle or LIAT. Oranjestad, Sint Eustatius . Tiny, off-the-radar and rather unusual, the tiny island of Sint Eustatius (or 'Statia'; population 3400) has been home to Caribs, French, Dutch and British residents; in 1776, it became the first foreign 'power' to recognize the USA. Now known for its diving, Statia has but one town, Oranjestad, memorable mostly for what it's lost. Ruins are everywhere. In town you can explore remnants of an 18th-century synagogue or collapsed Dutch church, then grab a snorkel to swim to offshore ruins of a part of town built on land-fill and since reclaimed by the sea. Afterwards, plan a day trip hike up the nearby Quill, a once-active volcano with great views from its crater. Lonely Planet: Caribbean DIY island-hopping . © 2011 Lonely Planet.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A small religious group has lost its fight before the Supreme Court to erect a granite monument in a Utah park next to an existing Ten Commandments display. Summum,a religious group,  wanted to place its own monument next to this Ten Commandments monument. In the free-speech case involving competing faiths, politics and social norms, the justices voted unanimously on Wednesday that such privately donated displays on public property represent ""government speech"" subject to local officials' discretion. Summum, a Salt Lake City-based group, wanted to put up a 3-foot granite slab on the ""Seven Aphorisms of Summum"" in the city of Pleasant Grove, at the group's expense. Local officials argued they should be allowed to decide which permanent displays can be erected, since they would claim ultimate ownership and control. The justices agreed with the city's view. ""It is hard to imagine how a public park could be opened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every person or group wishing to engage in that form of expression,"" wrote Justice Samuel Alito. At issue was whether donated monuments on public property represent private or government speech. The ruling could affect monuments nationwide, ranging from 9/11 victim tributes to battlefield markers. ""It is clear that the monuments in Pleasant Grove's Pioneer Park represent government speech,"" wrote Alito. Summum argued that by denying it the necessary permit to erect the monument, it was being discriminated against because the existing Ten Commandments monument was placed there in 1971 by another private group, the Fraternal Order of Eagles. The case dealt only with free speech constraints, not the Establishment Clause, which prohibits government endorsement of religious faith or doctrine. Both are contained in the Constitution's First Amendment. Justice Antonin Scalia confidently stated that the current Ten Commandments display in Pleasant Grove does ""not violate any part of the First Amendment... The city can safely exhale."" Not so fast, said Brian Barnard, Summum's lawyer. He notes the case now goes back to lower federal courts, where his group will make a new argument: The city violates the separation of church and state doctrine. ""We're going to say the city has adopted clearly religious tenets of theTen Commandments as their speech,"" Barnard told CNN, ""and given this mounment has a prominent display in their public park, it's clearly in violation of the Establishment Clause."" He heads the Utah Civil Rights and Liberties Foundation. Two justices seemed to anticipate the upcoming legal fight. ""Even if the Free Speech Clause neither restricts nor protects government speech, government speakers are bound by the Constitution's other proscriptions, including those supplied by the Establishment and Equal Protection Clause,"" wrote Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""These constitutional safeguards ensure that the effect of today's decision will be limited."" A conservative legal group that represented the Utah city hailed the high court ruling. ""The decision gives government the right to speak for itself and the ability to communicate on behalf of its citizens,"" said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice. ""It's a landmark decision that clears the way for government to express its views and its history through the selection of monuments -- including religious monuments and displays."" The ruling joins a series of decisions in which the Supreme Court has refused to offer a broad rule on religious monuments, taking a more case-specific approach. Ten Commandments displayed in public schools were banned in 1980. But the justices in 2005 allowed a 57-year-old Ten Commandments granite monument to stay on the Texas statehouse grounds, where it stands amid a series of nonreligious symbols. A similar display in Kentucky was ordered removed after the high court concluded it violated the separation between church and state. Unlike Utah, those cases involved efforts to remove the monuments. Summum was founded in 1975 by Summum ""Corky"" Ra, who claimed alien visitors-- or ""advanced living beings""-- revealed the Summum concepts to him. He gathered several dozen members and launched a legal fight to erect monuments. He died earlier this year. Classified as a tax-exempt church, Summum's members prefer to call it a philosophical group. They claim no over-arching doctrine or supreme being, but their movement is extensively laid out in pamphlets, a Web site and Internet radio broadcasts. On its one-acre compound in Salt Lake City -- along with a 27-foot-tall copper-shelled pyramid -- is a building where the group uses resins and fiberglass in a lengthy rite of mummification, which the group's current leader, Su Menu, called a key aspect of Summum, central to the idea that ""the soul moves forward."" Both humans and pets undergo the procedure. The Seven Aphorisms are psychokinesis, correspondence, vibration, opposition, rhythm, cause and effect and gender. ""All we want to do is share what we have with everyone else. I mean, it's not like proselytizing,"" said Menu, 53, who is a piano teacher. ""Not everyone follows the Ten Commandments, so maybe people are looking for something else, and all we want to do is show them the possibility."" Pleasant Grove, with a population of 30,000, lies between Salt Lake City and Provo. Pioneer Park includes an old schoolhouse and wagons, along with the Ten Commandments monument, tucked back near a 9/11 memorial placed by a local Boy Scouts troop. ""This park is dedicated to the history of the people, the founding of the city and significant citizens who have lived and contributed to the community,"" said Mayor Mike Daniels. He said the Ten Commandments display was allowed because the Fraternal Order of Eagles,  which has erected similar monuments in hundreds of other communities since the 1950s, has long-standing ties to the community and performs continuing charity work. A federal appeals court had ruled for Summum, concluding parks are a ""public forum"" to which private groups have access under free-speech protections. Alito in his ruling cited several pop-culture references to illustrate how monuments convey often-competing meanings. One included the ad slogan ""Beef. It's What's for Dinner."" Another included the lyrics to John Lennon's 1971 song ""Imagine,"" which he said was made part of a mosaic honoring the late performer in New York's Central Park.","Justices ruled park displays are government speech .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In the developing world millions of people struggle to operate machinery, read from a blackboard, or just see the world around them, because they don't have access to the eyeglasses they need. Self-refraction glasses let the wearer adjust the lenses to suit their vision, without the need for an optometrist. But a pair of glasses developed by Joshua Silver, a physics professor at the University of Oxford, offers an affordable solution. The glasses can be adjusted to the right strength by the wearer without the need to visit an optometrist. A major reason for that is a chronic shortage of optometrists -- in Ghana, for example, there is just one for every eight million people. That makes it incredibly difficult for ordinary people to visit an optometrist, without which it's impossible for them to get glasses. But Silver thinks he may have come up with a solution to the problem. His self-refraction glasses mean people can correct their vision without needing an optometrist (see Fact Box). ""Take a Sub-Saharan country where there is one optometrist for every million people; those people will never see an optometrist, so how will they get eyewear?,"" he told CNN. ""Any model of delivery of vision correction in the developing world that depends on eye care professionals won't work. If you find a model that doesn't rely on them, then you potentially have a solution."" Silver has been developing the glasses for over 20 years and continues to research the technology at the Center for Vision in the Developing World (CVDW) at the University of Oxford. He told CNN that about 80 percent of those who try the glasses are able to correct their vision, but there are limitations. They can't be used to correct astigmatism and it's not known if they are suitable for children, although the CVDW is currently running a study to determine if schoolchildren can correct their own vision with their teachers' help. So far, 30,000 pairs of self-refraction glasses have been distributed around the world, through an adult literacy program in Ghana and the U.S. Military Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) Program. The man behind the HCA program was Kevin White. He has now retired from the military and has set up Global Vision 2020 to distribute self-adjustable glasses. White has just returned from Liberia, where he trained 40 people from local NGOs to dispense the glasses. White sees charity organizations already working in developing countries as the key to distribution. ""If I can train people from existing networks to dispense glasses, and they can spare one day each week or month to dispense the glasses, then they can see 50 to 100 people in a day -- and that's a way to reach a lot of people,"" White told CNN. But for the program to be sustainable, White says the next step is to train his dispensers to become trainers themselves, so that he builds a growing network of people in developing countries who can distribute the glasses. Silver estimates that one billion people in the developing world don't have access to the glasses they need, and he has said that he would like to see all of them wearing glasses by 2020. But he is under no illusions that he can do it alone. ""No one person or company can possibly deliver that many glasses by 2020. There's a big infrastructure that needs to be set up to do that, and I'd like to see it happen,"" he told CNN. Distribution is one problem, cost is another. Currently, it cost $19 to manufacture a pair of self-refraction glasses, and Silver acknowledges that the price needs to come down to a few dollars a pair to make them affordable. Another issue is style. The glasses are currently functional, rather than fashionable, and that may limit their uptake, but more cosmetic versions are being developed. Silver says far more research is needed before those one billion people get their glasses, but he sees his self-refraction technology as a step toward that goal. He told CNN, ""It's one of the world's largest problems. There's an immense amount of interest in solving it and self-refraction is one route that can assist with that.""","A lack of optometrists means many in the developing world can't get glasses .

The technology could be used to provide glasses for one billion people .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi government accused a manufacturer of supplying the country with some fake bomb detectors and said Tuesday it plans to sue the company. However, government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said that three Iraqi investigations into the devices determined most of the bomb detectors are working, although some are fake and ineffective. He did not name the detectors in his statement or explain the investigations. The alleged fakes have been removed from Iraqi streets and have been replaced by functioning ones, al-Dabbagh said. It was not immediately clear how many of such devices were replaced. Those involved in contracting or importing those devices will be investigated, he said, and the government will sue the manufacturing company. He did not name the firm. Earlier this year, the Iraqi government announced it would investigate the ADE651 after concerns surfaced the device was a hoax. The handheld device is commonly used at checkpoints in Iraq and Afghanistan to detect explosives. The British government has banned the ADE651, made by British firm ATSC, from being exported. The company declined to comment to CNN earlier this month, citing ongoing legal action. There was no immediate response to Iraq's announcement Tuesday. The firm's Web site said it was under repair, and no one answered calls Tuesday to a phone number listed for the company. Police have arrested and questioned Jim McCormick, managing director of ATSC, alleging suspicion of fraud. Also this month, the Thai government said a similar device, the GT200, failed rigorous tests carried out by scientists and the army in Thailand. The government said it was looking into the possibility of legal action against its manufacturer. The device's manufacturer, Britain-based Global Technical, disputed the tests' results. It said the results were ""completely at odds with other tests carried out by independent bodies"" and with ""the experience of the large number of users of this product all over the world."" Both the ADE651 and GT200 use technology that some scientists dismiss as little more than a car antenna mounted on a plastic box designed to act much the way a dowsing rod is used to find water.","Iraqi government says manufacturer supplied some fake bomb detectors .

Pittsburgh Summit - Hear about some of the challenges facing the world's leading economic powers. 20 Years of News - Look back at some headlines you've seen over 20 years of CNN Student News! Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR:  Celebrating 20 years of commercial-free news for the classroom, this is CNN Student News! This show is awesome. I'm Carl Azuz. You know how we look now; over my shoulder, you can see our sweet graphics from the 1980s. A look back is coming up after our top stories. Let's go! First Up: Terror Indictment . AZUZ: First up, a new charge against Najibullah Zazi, one of the suspects arrested in connection with a terrorism investigation. He's been indicted on a charge of conspiracy ""to use weapons of mass destruction."" Zazi was arrested last weekend. This is all part of a Justice Department investigation into an alleged plot to set off explosives in the U.S. In a hearing yesterday, another suspect, Ahmad Afzali, who was arrested on charges of lying to authorities, was released on bail of $1.5 million. But his travel is being restricted. Security Council . AZUZ:  Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council is looking to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. All 15 countries who are members of the group voted for a resolution that would tighten control on nuclear materials. The measure also supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The presidency of the Security Council rotates between the member nations. This month, the U.S. has it, which is why President Obama ran yesterday's meeting. Pittsburgh Summit . AZUZ:  After the U.N. summit, he and other world leaders headed to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for a gathering of the G-20, a group of the world's leading economic powers. They're not the only ones in town, though. Protesters have flocked to the city to take part in demonstrations. Yesterday, an unauthorized march turned violent as protesters clashed with police officers. As for the G-20, the global economy has improved since the last time it got together. But as Ed Henry reports, there's still a lot of work to do. ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: When these 20 leaders last met, it was spring in London and the global recession was still catching fire. But as President Obama wrapped up his first big moment on the international stage, he declared they were putting out the flames. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We finished a very productive summit that will be, I believe, a turning point in our pursuit of global economic recovery. HENRY: Five months later, there are signs the recession is coming to a close. But unemployment is still sky-high, helping to fuel protesters already waiting for the leaders in Pittsburgh. (SOUND OF PROTESTERS) HENRY: The president acknowledged to CNN's John King that unemployment may get worse in the next few months, which is why he will be pushing his counterparts to sign on to a specific pledge to make the global economy more balanced. OBAMA: We can't go back to the era where the Chinese or the Germans or other countries just are selling everything to us, we're taking out a bunch of credit card debt or home equity loans, but we're not selling anything to them. HENRY: But getting the Chinese to sign on will be difficult, especially after Mr. Obama slapped a tariff on Chinese tires, which raised questions about whether leaders are reneging on free trade promises they made in London. STEVEN SCHRAGE, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC & INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: So, is the United States going to be standing up and stopping this slippage? Or is it going to be further pushing the world down towards trade conflicts and possibly a downward spiral of new types of protectionism? HENRY: Another potential dispute: European leaders continue to push hard for a crackdown on bonuses paid to bankers. And while Mr. Obama last week reiterated his call for broader reform of Wall Street, his hand has been weakened by inaction in Washington. SCHRAGE: The U.S. is really handicapped by the fact that its own reforms haven't gotten out of Congress. So, while they can talk about these broad reforms, until the United States is really active, it's hard for them to set the course. Disaster Declaration . AZUZ: Catching up on a couple other headlines now, starting with the recovery process in Georgia following this week's deadly flooding. President Obama has issued a Federal Disaster Declaration for four counties in the state. That will free up money and aid to help with the relief efforts. Requests for federal aid in other counties are being reviewed. Kennedy Replacement . AZUZ: And the governor of Massachusetts has picked Paul Kirk, who you see here, to fill the U.S. Senate seat left empty by the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy. He's only taking over the seat temporarily, however. A special election for a permanent replacement is set for January. Kirk has said he doesn't intend to take part in that process. Shoutout . NINETTE SOSA, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Which of these existed 20 years ago? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) World Wide Web, B) DVDs, C) MP3 players or D) Text messaging? You've got three seconds -- GO!   Trick question! None of these existed 20 years ago.

The name has changed, but the goal has been the same: bringing you the world's top stories. Here's a look back at some of the biggest headlines from the past two decades.

There's a major hurricane that's in the Gulf of Mexico. We are facing a storm that most of us have feared. BUSH, 43RD U.S. PRESIDENT: I'm not going to forget what I've seen. BUSH, 43RD U.S. PRESIDENT: Last night, the government of North Korea proclaimed to the world that it had conducted a nuclear test. Such a claim itself constitutes a threat to international peace and security. BUSH, 43RD U.S. PRESIDENT: Our nation grieves with those who have lost loved ones at Virginia Tech. We hold the victims in our hearts. We lift them up in our prayers, and we ask a loving God to comfort those who are suffering today. SEN.

"(EW.com) -- Pick a box-office record and ""The Avengers"" has probably broken it. Biggest opening weekend of all time? Check. Biggest Saturday gross of all time? Check. Most popular movie released this year featuring intense archery scenes? (Sorry, ""Hunger Games."") Highest-grossing superhero movie ever? Not yet, but consider this a warning: ""Dark Knight,"" your days are numbered. But as we all know, the most important thing about ""The Avengers"" is undoubtedly its role in the brilliant career of one Samuel Leroy Jackson. Back in October, the Guinness Book of World Records named Jackson the highest-grossing actor in the history of movies -- the result of Jackson's insane four-films-per-year work ethic, his willingness to take supporting roles in mega-productions, and what we can only assume is a tremendous sense of humor. Now that ""Avengers"" looks set to make a billion dollars before the end of this sentence, the question becomes: Can anyone ever outgross Jackson? After his cameo in ""Iron Man,"" the actor signed a nine-film commitment with Marvel, which means we can expect him to pop up in the next cycle of Avenger movies. (Easy money says that he has a brief appearance in ""Iron Man 3"" and a bigger role in ""Cap 2."" Hard to see how he fits into ""Thor 2,"" unless it turns out he's the human incarnation of Odin, which would be cool.) Even if phase 2 of Marvel's mad-scientist movie plan isn't as successful as phase 1 -- heck, even if ""Avengers 2"" makes half of what ""Avengers"" has made in two weeks of global release -- Jackson looks likely to achieve a career global tally of $10 billion. By comparison, Tom Cruise has only grossed $7 billion. And Tom Cruise doesn't get invited to devour the scenery in Quentin Tarantino movies. In short, that eyepatch might turn out to be the single most lucrative prop in movie history. If you could wear that eyepatch and Dorothy's ruby slippers and Audrey Hepburn's ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" dress while riding Rosebud the Sled and swinging Luke Skywalker's lightsaber... well, you'd be a real weirdo, but at least you'd be wearing a totally sweet eyepatch.

"(CNN) -- The first day of 2014 was a day to celebrate in our history -- it was the first time that all Americans could buy health insurance regardless of pre-existing medical conditions, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. But despite the good news, criticism of the ACA continues. Some Republicans have eagerly identified individuals who are not happy with the ACA. Sanjay Gupta: Better health not about Obamacare, it's about you . As 2014—a midterm election year—dawns, it is time to ask: What does the GOP offer other than negativism? What is the GOP alternative to the ACA, who would it help and who would it hurt? Until now, the Republican war cry has been repeal, for which they have voted repeatedly. But ACA repeal is neither realistic, responsible, nor perhaps, even possible. The 10 titles of the ACA contain hundreds of provisions that reform Medicare payment, combat fraud and abuse, and improve health care quality. Many are already in place. Total repeal of the ACA would rip many threads already woven into the fabric of our health care system. Opinion: When will we get the verdict on Obamacare? A targeted repeal of the less popular provisions of the ACA, the individual and employer mandates and some ACA taxes and fees, might be more feasible. But revoking the mandates would disrupt insurance markets and repealing the taxes will increase the deficit. Does the GOP have anything constructive to offer? The answer, sadly, is not really. House Republicans have put forward two proposals -- the American Health Care Reform Act, sponsored by a majority of House Republicans, and Rep. Tom Price's Empowering Patients First Act. Both are lengthy bills that largely recycle longstanding Republican panaceas. The American Health Care Reform Act would replace the ACA's income-based tax credits with flat dollar tax deductions. Tax deductions are valuable to high-income Americans with high tax rates, but offer little or nothing to the low-income Americans helped by the ACA. The Empowering Patients First Act offers flat dollar tax credits that do not vary by age, geography, or health status—all of which could influence health insurance premiums. These tax credits might almost fully cover the health insurance premium of a young healthy male, but would be essentially useless to an older, low-income family, which would be left thousands of dollars short of the cost of basic coverage. The American Health Care Reform Act touts health savings accounts as the solution to every problem, but tax-subsidized health savings accounts are also primarily of value to higher-income Americans and useless to Americans whose income is too low to be taxed and who lack discretionary income to invest in health savings accounts. As the media spotlight high cost sharing under ACA plans in the coming months, it should ask how much higher cost sharing would be under the GOP plans. Conservatives, such as John Goodman, champion very high deductible policies, and Republican proposals, unlike the ACA, do not limit cost sharing. By repealing the ACA, Republicans would reinstate pre-existing condition exclusions for many of the uninsured. The primary relief they offer to the uninsured with health problems are state high-risk pools. High-risk pools, however, are very expensive, and without massive federal support would be unaffordable to many Americans. Exclusion of Americans from insurance coverage would also likely increase under Republican proposals to permit interstate health insurance sales, which could drive a race to the bottom in state insurance regulation. Association health plans have a history of undermining state reforms aimed at covering individuals and groups with pre-existing conditions. Opinion: Why I signed up for Obamacare . One cannot imagine a GOP health care proposal that did not promise to place more barriers in the way of Americans injured by medical negligence who seek compensation. Although our medical litigation system could certainly use reform, proposals for change would reduce health care costs by only a small amount: half a percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, including defensive medicine. Republican malpractice ""reform"" proposals may be politically popular, but do not address our health care system's real problems. The GOP does not promise that if you like your insurance plan you can keep it, and with good reason. The vast majority of privately insured Americans are covered through their work. The American Health Care Reform Act would abolish current deductions and exclusions for employer-sponsored health insurance. This would not only be one of the largest middle class tax increases in American history, but could result in millions of Americans losing employer-sponsored insurance. Whatever disruptions the ACA may cause in coming months, it moves us toward more comprehensive and affordable coverage for low- and middle-income and sicker Americans. The alternatives proposed by House Republicans would be very disruptive, and unsurprisingly, benefit the healthy and wealthy. Americans must ask themselves: Who offers the most needed reforms for our health care system? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Jost.","Timothy Jost: The first day of 2014 was a day to celebrate in our history .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- If you've ever wondered how much money charities spend mailing you those glossy brochures and free address labels along with their request for a donation, the answer might surprise you. CNN has found that this type of direct-mail marketing cost two veterans charities tens of millions of dollars. Los Angeles-based National Veterans Foundation raised more than $22 million in donations over the past three years to help veterans, yet spent approximately $18.2 million paying its direct mail fund-raisers, according to IRS 990 forms. For nearly a year, the charity has been trying -- without success -- to get out of its contract with Brickmill Marketing and its parent company, Quadriga Art, according to NVF's Rich Rudnick. ""We were told for two years it would be very expensive, then we'd be going into the black,"" Rudnick told CNN. ""That never happened."" Quadriga Art is one of the world's largest direct-mail providers to charities and non-profits. Quadriga Art is the same fund-raiser hired by the Washington, D.C.-based Disabled Veterans National Foundation, which collected nearly $56 million in donations over the past three years, yet paid Quadriga Art more than $60 million in fees, according to a CNN investigation into the charity's tax records. Quadriga Art confirmed that its relationship with NVF is ending because ""fund-raising efforts did not prove as financially viable as the client had hoped,"" a spokesman wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Quadriga Art says although it increased the charity's donor base by more than 700,000 people, the direct-mail provider recommended phasing out the program last August based on its performance. And despite Brickmill and Quadriga Art being paid more than $18 million by NVF, Quadriga Art says it actually lost money. Meanwhile, DVNF still has a business relationship with Quadriga through 2013. The independent group CharityWatch gave both charities an ""F"" grade because of the miniscule amount of money they spend on actually helping veterans. ""It's as if you're looking at these ratios through a fun house mirror,"" Daniel Borochoff, CharityWatch president, told CNN. ""It really ought to be reversed, it ought to be flipped, they ought to be giving 80 or 90 percent to helping veterans, not only 12 percent. It's really pathetic."" Beyond its finances, the other services that the National Veterans Foundation offers to veterans are also questionable. On its website, it says one of its principal benefits to veterans is a toll-free hotline, but the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington operates several similar toll-free hotlines for veterans seeking a variety of services. In a statement, the charity said that it has been in business 27 years and that it serves thousands of veterans each year through its toll-free hotline. CNN attempted to visit the National Veterans Foundation office near the Los Angeles International Airport, but staffers said that they would not speak on camera, refused to allow CNN inside, and declined CNN's request to photograph the call center that the charity says it operates there. CNN's recent investigation into the Disabled Veterans National Foundation found that the charity was doling out massive amounts of candy, hand sanitizer bottles and many other unnecessary items to veteran aid groups, surplus items it had obtained for free. It also claimed in its tax filings more than $838,000 in fair market value donations to one charity, although the bill of lading obtained by CNN showed that the donations -- which included chef's coats and aprons -- was valued at around $234,000. DVNF vice president Valerie Conley stressed that ""not all the funds"" raised by the foundation go to fund-raising. ""The cost of fund-raising is high, as you know, and it has been for many veteran service organizations who use this kind of direct paying approach,"" she said. But CharityWatch's Borochoff says these charities are wasting public donations, and the only ones benefiting are the marketing firms. ""We really have to ask why is this going on, what's the point?"" he said in an interview with CNN. ""This really should be called the 'National Enrich Fund-raising Foundation' rather than the National Veterans Foundation because ... the amount of help that the veterans receive is so small.""

"(CNN) -- The last time I checked in with psychologist and school consultant Michael Thompson, ""Tiger Mom"" was making headlines for how she drove her children to succeed. Thompson gave us memorable vignettes from the front lines, including: ""You know you're an extreme parent if you imagine that your child is going to play professional sports even though no coach has predicted this outcome."" And, ""You know you're an extreme parent if you have your child take 30 practice SAT exams before the actual test."" Extreme parents don't necessarily take a break over the summer. Neither does Thompson: ""You know you're an extreme parent,"" he tells me, ""if you send your child to camp for a month and then you go on the website every day to find a smiling picture of your child and you get frantic and call the camp if you can't find one."" There's also the ""call me"" parent. ""I had a camp director tell me he had a child who arrived with three cell phones,"" says Thompson: ""one to turn in, one to use illegally until it was confiscated, and then the backup phone."" These true stories helped persuade Thompson to write his new book about the value of summer camp. It's called: ""Homesick and Happy: How Time Away From Parents Can Help A Child Grow."" Some of us parents have children who at this very moment may be homesick at sleep-away camp. Michael Thompson's heart bleeds for them. But the bleeding stops when he thinks about the ""developmental leaps"" so many children make at summer camp, having challenged themselves in ways they don't when their parents are around. Thompson visited 20 camps and spoke to about 200 campers for ""Homesick and Happy."" He is struck by how campers love to recount what he calls their ""campfire horror stories"" -- of cold, miserable nights and mosquito bites all over their bodies. ""[T]hese girls are standing there with these brilliant smiles on their faces, talking about their discomfort,"" says Thompson, ""but they're talking about their personal triumph over discomfort and the fact that they were braver than they thought they were going to be. They didn't get immobilized. They didn't cry. They ate their cold dinner, went to bed, their sleeping bag was a little wet, and they come back with a story of triumph."" Thompson says he logs about 100,000 miles a year visiting schools and speaking to parents. Self-esteem is a dominant concern. ""Parents say, 'How do I give my child self-esteem?' ... And they're always a little demoralized when I say, 'You can't give your child self-esteem.' "" So how is camp connected to self-esteem? In Thompson's view, camp is ""the closest thing to Hogwarts that kids are likely to get. ... All of children's literature knows that the adventures only begin when you're away from your parents. Every great children's story is driven by the child being away from parents, experiencing things on their own."" Thompson doesn't wish Harry Potter's family situation on anyone. But there's a lesson in Potter for us all. ""Your parent has to open the door and let you walk out and find independence, experience it and become comfortable with it,"" says Thompson. ""That is camp, for me."" This is what Thompson sees when he consults with schools from September to June: ""The constant pressure year after year makes kids incredibly anxious and they develop symptoms around anxiety and stress and they can't sleep and they worry all the time and they never feel they're done. And I think, gosh, you're living a life of a middle aged executive and you're only in 10th grade."" Which is why this last insight is so critical, whether our children are at camp or at home this summer. ""Camp is just whimsical a lot of the time,"" says Thompson. ""And in this competitive economy, we're not often whimsical with our children. And they absolutely love whimsy."" Thompson's discoveries have opened my eyes. Starting now, I will be the most whimsical dad ever. I'm not letting you know how I define whimsy. Because I'm determined to turn my whimsy into a competitive advantage for my children. They will have the whimsy edge! As for my child who is in camp right now, I'm not going to be one of those extreme parents. I'm not looking on the camp website for my child's smiling face. But I'm imagining it. How are you creating independent children? Have you had trouble letting go?

"(CNN) -- An image of the new United States ambassador to China trying to buy a coffee at an airport in Seattle has caused a stir in his adopted country. Former U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke was snapped by a passing Chinese traveler on August 12 at a Starbucks coffee shop without any security and carrying his own backpack as he waited with his family. The traveler immediately uploaded the picture, taken on his iPhone, to Chinese micro-blogging site, Sina Weibo, where it was picked up by bloggers and the mainstream media alike in China. Within two days the image was re-posted more than 40,000 times. They appeared to be impressed by the understated envoy's low key approach, which is in stark contrast to the tight security that typically follows senior Chinese diplomats. ""He's carrying his own backpack,"" exclaimed the Beijing Times, while the government-run Beijing Legal News observed that Locke's family ""look like ordinary travelers."" Meanwhile, one blogger commented, ""You people out of China might think this photo is too ordinary and can't see much out of it, but for Chinese it's shocking."" The author of the image, named by Sina Weibo as TangChaohui_adSage, later posted a message saying the Starbucks staff even refused Locke's attempts to exchange his discount coupon for a coffee, forcing him to pay with a credit card. This prompted some bloggers to joke that the U.S. must really be suffering economically if its ambassador was forced to use such a voucher. Other bloggers simply praised Locke for being the kind of official they crave. ""This (Locke) is the model government official figure Chinese citizens wish for because China doesn't have officials like this,"" wrote one. The outgoing U.S. ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman, won admirers in China for his informal style. He would often get around Beijing on his bicycle rather than the official ambassadorial limousine. CNN's Xiaoni Chen contributed to this report.","Gary Locke named as the new U.S. ambassador to China .

"(CNN) -- In the game of chess, one woman has dominated all others for more than 20 years. Judit Polgar has defeated nine world champions including Garry Kasparov, Boris Spassky and Viswanathan Anand, and is the only female ever to join an exclusive coterie of players rated above 2700 by the World Chess Federation. Although she is the only woman ranked among the World Chess Federation's Top 100, Polgar has never won the Women's World Championship. By 14, she had so outstripped her female peers that she ceased competing in women's tournaments. ""I have no problem with other women,"" she said, ""but if I had played against ladies there would be a huge gap between the two of us."" ""I played against men because it was challenging, it was interesting, and I felt I could improve the fastest and the best (against them). It's very important to know what your aims and ambitions are."" In chess, women's tournaments are only open to females, but women may compete in tournaments for men. It was Polgar's older sister Susan who broke this gender barrier, becoming the first woman to qualify for the men's world championship in 1986, and the first woman to earn a men's grandmaster title in 1991. Younger sister, Sofia, is an International Chess Master, too. The family's success ignited an ongoing debate about whether genius is born or created, the sexual politics of professional sport, and the value of mixed gender competition. After Polgar became a mother in 2004, she posed another challenge to the establishment: She didn't retire. Currently ranked 44th in the world with a rating of 2698, and a mother of two, Polgar is competing at the Chess Olympiad, which begins in Istanbul this week, and in the London Chess Classic in December. Hothoused in chess . By the time she was five, Judit could beat her father at chess. She and her sisters were home schooled as part of an educational experiment by their father, Laszlo, who believed any child could excel at an early age if given the right schooling. Besides learning Esperanto, they were hothoused in the game of chess. More from Leading Women: Late comic Phyllis Diller's funniest gags . Judit played her first international tournament aged nine, winning the New York Open. ""It was a special feeling, you can imagine, for a nine-year-old girl to beat an adult, or even to be in competition,"" she said. Aged 11, she beat her first grandmaster, and became one herself in 1991, at the age of 15 -- relieving American Bobby Fischer of his record as the youngest-ever grandmaster. Polgar's father firmly believed that, since chess is a purely mental competition, women ought to be able to perform at the same level as men. By the time she was 14, Polgar had so outstripped her female peers that she saw little point in competing in women's tournaments. ""I played against men most of my life because our goal was that I wanted to reach the highest potential to be an absolute world champion,"" she said. ""There was a very big difference, even bigger than now, between the best male and the best female players in chess. ""My father believed that the higher you put your goal, the higher you reach. That was the main reason me and my sisters were playing mostly against male competitors."" Tigress at the board . It might not have been Polgar's explicit intention to challenge male domination in chess -- but a challenge was nevertheless perceived. Media attention focused heavily on the spectacle of a young girl competing against men sometimes four decades her senior. More from Leading Women: The brains behind the most viral ad ever . No great chess player ever likes to lose, but losing to a girl was seen as particularly humiliating. When Polgar won the Boys Under 14 section of the World Youth Chess Festival in 1990, one columnist wrote approvingly that it was easy to forget that Polgar was "" just a girl."" But by 2001, the New York Times reported that, ""In the highly masculine world of top-level chess, it is no disgrace to lose to Judit Polgar ... In person, Miss Polgar gives no hint that she is a tigress at the chessboard. She is soft-spoken, modest and very feminine ... "" Today, Polgar says that, if it was strange for chess pundits to see a young girl catapulted to the top, it was strange for her too. ""There was a point when it was a bit much for me, and I couldn't handle the journalists' questions and all the fuss about my results ... I had to realize that I was a role model for other girls and their parents -- they wanted them to follow in my footsteps. But I focused on chess,"" Polgar said. ""I didn't think about other things."" In 2002, Polgar finally defeated Garry Kasparov, who had previously described her as ""talented but not greatly talented,'' explaining that ""women by their nature are not exceptional chess players ... not great fighters,"" in a 1990 interview with The New York Times. But in a game Polgar described as ""one of the most remarkable moments"" of her career, she won in 42 moves. Kasparov later credited the Polgars' career success in a chapter on anti-complacency tactics in his book, ""How Life Imitates Chess."" ""By seeking out and often besting the toughest competition,"" he wrote, ""the Polgars showed that there are no inherent limitations to their aptitude -- an idea that many male players refused to accept until they had unceremoniously been crushed by a twelve-year-old with a ponytail."" In 2003, Polgar enjoyed one of her best results. At a tournament in the Netherlands, she finished half a point behind current World Champion Viswanathan Anand, a point ahead of Vladimir Kramnik (who Polgar has yet to beat), and beat Karpov. The following year, her son Oliver was born, and she took time out from chess. In 2005, she competed in two tournaments which brought her to her highest spot on the rankings board -- world number eight. Things fall apart . ""Being professional means 100% is not enough,"" she said. ""Number one, two and three in my life was chess. The reality for women is, when a child comes into the picture, priorities change."" More from Leading Women: At last, it's Zaha Hadid's time to shine . After her daughter was born in 2006, Polgar says, ""things in my career dropped, pretty much. Not only my rating points but I was not happy with the way I was playing."" Her ranking dropped from 10th to 50th in the world and in 2008 she finished last in the World Chess Blitz Championship. ""Everything really kind of fell apart,"" she told Chess magazine, ""even though I have had help with my children from day one from grandparents and nannies. ""First of all, my priorities in life and in my mind definitely changed. I didn't have the same interest in chess as I had before."" As she reveals in an upcoming book, ""How I Beat Fischer's Record"" it wasn't until she played an opening gambit that had been a childhood favorite (the King's Gambit) against the eventual winner of the 2009 World Cup, that she felt like devoting herself to chess again. ""It felt like for a moment the Judit from 1988, who many (including myself) had forgotten, had come back to deliver her trademark brilliancies,"" she wrote. Polgar has decided to continue with her professional career despite the juggling she now has to do. ""I'm a maximalist and I like to do things in a maximal way,"" she said. ""It's extremely difficult to admit to myself that maybe I cannot, because there are too many fields in my life that I'm covering: Being a mother, being a wife, being a professional player, coordinating chess events and writing books. ""(But) I started to play chess when I was five and ever since, I liked the game. And after all, I can still do things which give me a lot of pleasure."" ""When I got married, many of my colleagues thought my life was going to go in a different direction and I probably wouldn't care about my game anymore. Actually, it was the contrary. Somehow I became more balanced and my life became more complete.""","Polgar became the youngest ever grandmaster at 15, taking title from Bobby Fischer .

These nuggets of insight, and much more, are on display in a new preview video for an upcoming reality series, ""Start-Ups: Silicon Valley,"" which premieres November 5 on Bravo. The show promises to follow six budding tech entrepreneurs as they try to market their ideas, launch companies and get really, really rich. But Bravo is not interested in watching engineers code. Instead, the clip shows its young, attractive stars lounging poolside, rock climbing, doing shots, going to toga parties and boasting about their "" 'work hard, play hard' mentality."" There's no mention of what products, if any, they've created. But the promo does pack an impressive number of clichés and tangled metaphors into its 2 minutes, 21 seconds.

It's not something you do if you don't want to roll the dice."" Then there's the young woman who motions to her face and says, ""People have been intimidated, because this package generally doesn't come with a brain."" Shockingly, the Internet has not been kind. ""If you watch the latest promo for Bravo's Silicon Valley reality show and think, hey these entrepreneurs failed actors are just stringing together tech buzzwords, it's because that's exactly what they're doing,"" writes Gizmodo. ""This show looks awful, but we'd be lying if we said we weren't going to watch Start-Ups ... with glee/horror."" The video trailer has a rating of two out of five stars -- on Bravo's own website. A commenter on the show's Facebook page says, ""You focused on an exception not the rule and in the process you disrespect most of Silicon Valley."" And on Twitter, TechCrunch co-editor Alexa Tsotsis quipped, ""Here Comes Silicon Valley Boo Boo."" The TV show has a respectable pedigree: It's co-produced by Randi Zuckerberg, former marketing director of Facebook and sister of its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. But early observers still give the promo low marks for authenticity. ""Dang! Real SV women sure don't look like that in the show.

""I am writing this (blog) post just weeks away from competing for Miss America because I do not want to shock the nation when I'm seen in a swimsuit, bearing my marks. I want to explain the meanings and reasons behind them, and why I am opting to show them proudly,"" she wrote in August. Both tattoos are on her right ribcage. One is of the Serenity Prayer, running from her armpit to her hip. It was partially obscured by her bikini strap during the swimsuit segment of the pageant. The other is a military medical insignia. Her plans include a career in dentistry. Tattoos and piercings: How young is too young? Vail wrote that she chose to get the prayer tattoo because she was bullied as a youngster and the prayer gave her the strength to get through high school and boot camp.

"(CNN)  -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who faces charges of crimes against humanity, visited Zimbabwe on Sunday for a regional trade meeting. Sudan president Omar al-Bashir is the first head of state ever indicted by the ICC. Al-Bashir landed Saturday in the capital, Harare, for the two-day African leaders' summit of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for al-Bashir on March 4, accusing him of complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity in his government's campaign against rebels in Darfur in western Sudan. It was the first arrest warrant for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands. Sudan expelled 13 international aid agencies from the Darfur region after the warrant was issued. Al-Bashir has denied the charges, calling them an attempt by Western powers to recolonize Sudan. The conflict in Darfur began in 2003 after rebels in the western region of Sudan began attacking government positions. The government responded with a fierce military campaign that has left about 300,000 dead and more than 2.5 million displaced, the United Nations estimates. The International Criminal Court has no arrest powers and depends on its 106-member states to take suspects into custody. Al-Bashir has visited other counties, including Qatar and Ethiopia, since the warrant was issued. In Zimbabwe, the summit will be at the Victoria Falls, a popular tourism spot on the Zambezi River. Sudan is a member of the trade group, which consists of 19 African nations.","Sudan president Omar al-Bashir visits Zimbabwe despite arrest warrant .

"(CNN) -- Three years ago, a few days before Andrew Cadieux's 21st birthday, a stranger sharing his last name sent him a message on Facebook. His mother denied knowing the person at first, but eventually admitted the stranger was his birth mother's sister. The woman he'd called mom all his life was another aunt. The revelation tore the lid off 21 years of family drama that she'd hidden from him. Cadieux's birth mother had Down syndrome and couldn't care for him; his aunt and uncle had adopted him. When his adoptive father died, a feud tore the family apart, leading Cadieux's mother to decide it was better to sever ties with the family and never share with the young boy his history. ""Without Facebook, she wouldn't be part of my life because they didn't want her to have anything to do with me,"" the 24-year-old software engineer from Connecticut said. It's hard to keep secrets in the age of social media and the adoption world is no exception. Cadieux's story is just one that shows how the Internet is making it easier for birth relatives to find each other, hastening the end of the era of ""closed"" adoption, the nonprofit Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute said in a report released Thursday. Birth parents are seeking out their kids and adopted children are going online to find biological relatives, often without their adoptive parents' knowledge, according to the report, ""Untangling the Web: The Internet's Transformative Impact on Adoption."" Adam Pertman, executive director of the Adoption Institute, said he hopes the report will help shape policies and practices that harness the new technology while protecting vulnerable children and parents. ""We hope this report will serve as a wake-up call that something historic is happening that demands the attention of legislators, practitioners, law-enforcement officials and the affected parties themselves,"" Pertman said. The report also addresses the ""growing commodification"" of adoption through scams and unregulated websites that raise ethical and legal concerns. It's now nearly impossible -- and perhaps unethical -- to promise secrecy or anonymity in adoptions, the report suggests. The report calls for more education and training to help adoption professionals understand the positive and negative uses of the Internet, along with revised training programs that assume most people will be able to find each other at some point. ""Everything from A-to-Z is being rewritten without best practices or guidance,"" Pertman said. ""We have a maze in front of us and we have to learn to navigate it and provide people with resources, or they're going to get lost in it."" Over the past few decades, it has become more common for birth parents and adopted parents to agree to some sort of open relationship, the report says. A recent survey found that 100 infant adoption programs in the United States reported 5% of their adoptions were completely closed, while 55% were fully open and 40% were mediated through an agency, the study said. Even in open adoptions, it can be hard for people to resist crossing boundaries. Why wait for a picture in the mail when you can peek at someone on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram? But if both sides communicate, they can reach an agreement on how to handle each other's lives online and offline. Alison Cohen's daughter used to send her letters and pictures through her adoptive parents. But when the 13-year-old started sending Cohen e-mails, she knew she had to tell the girl's parents. ""I was aware of her need for connection and I wanted that so much for myself, too,"" said Cohen, who lives in Evanston, Illinois. ""But then I had to realize I'm not the parent making the decisions and I need to stay in my own place in the picture, and also, we will both get what we want in the future as life plays out. ""Sort of like delayed gratification."" The girl's adoptive parents weren't comfortable with e-mail at the time, but Cohen was grateful to hear they wanted her to have more frequent contact with their daughter as she got older. Last year, for the first time since her birth, Cohen's daughter met her birth mother. The girl is now 16, and e-mails with Cohen with her adoptive parents' permission. A few years ago, her daughter friended her on Facebook; Cohen hasn't accepted it, but she keeps it in the queue so she can see how the profile picture changes. ""The Internet does provide more opportunities for surveillance of each other but not really in a negative way,"" she said. ""It's hard to walk that line between wanting to respect boundaries and still wanting a connection. ""The Internet opens up possibilities but it doesn't change any of the inherent complicated feelings that everyone has around the situation."" Indeed, not everyone agrees open adoption always works. In a recent guest post on the blog ""Portrait of an Adoption,"" a woman who adopted a child from foster care detailed her decision to close the adoption for the child's safety. The boy's biological parents had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and erratic behavior. In the few instances she initiated contact, the mother angrily demanded to see her child, signaling to the adoptive mother that she was unstable. ""I tried to open up our adoption, maybe just a little bit. And it was a huge mistake. The state created closed adoptions from foster care for a reason,"" the adoptive mother wrote in her post, ""Why My Son Has a Closed Adoption."" ""I will never badmouth his birth parents to him. He has seen their photos and I answer whatever basic questions he has. But he hasn't had many. When he is 18, he can read my huge, thick file of his records from the state, including his birth parents' full names etc. ""But while he is underage, I will protect him and keep him safe. Even from his own relatives."" The Internet has created vast support networks for birth parents, adoptive parents and adoptees, including blogs, social media sites and message boards. Among the millions of links, though, it's easy for those seeking guidance to be overwhelmed. It took Sandi Aiken six years to find BirthMom Buds, a support group for expectant mothers or mothers who found new families for their children. They were the first ones she turned to after she learned that her 17-year-old son wanted to visit her. Two months earlier, in September 2010, the son she had named Christopher sent her a message on Facebook: ""Hello Mom. I finally found you."" Aiken had hoped to one day meet the son she gave up for adoption years earlier, but she worried he would hate her. Friends from the support group told her to be brave. She went to the airport two hours ahead of time and cried while she waited. She was unsure if she would recognize him but as soon as he rounded the corner she knew it was him. The two embraced, marking the start of a relationship that continues to thrive, she said, even with his adoptive family. ""It's like he was never out of my life even though he went down a different path,"" the Arkansas woman said. ""I feel good about it, too, knowing he had a good life and became the fine young man he is today."" Not every encounter has a storybook ending. Cadieux is happy he knows who his biological mother is, but it hasn't brought peace or closure to the rest of his family. It took him two years to respond to the Facebook message and call his mother. They spoke briefly about her decision, and he concluded that Down syndrome had prevented her from making her own decision. Cadieux pitied her. The two became Facebook friends, keeping in touch through occasional messages, he said. But in the interest of avoiding conflict, he hasn't taken the relationship any further. There's still a lot of tension between his adoptive family and the one he never knew, and he's not interested in starting another feud. ""I can't blame her for wanting to see her son grow up,"" he said. ""This is a way for her to stay quietly in the background and be a part of my life.""

"(CNN) -- New Orleans police have issued arrest warrants for former NFL star Darren Sharper and another man in connection with the alleged rapes of two women. Sharper, 38, and Erik Nunez, 26, each face two counts of aggravated rape, the Orleans Parish district attorney's office said in a statement. Sharper and Nunez face the possibility of life without parole if convicted. CNN reached out to an attorney for Sharper and to Nunez, but neither immediately returned messages seeking comment. Sharper has also been charged in California with two counts of rape by use of drugs and other charges, according to Los Angeles County prosecutors. He pleaded not guilty last week. ""Mr. Sharper must stay in Los Angeles County,"" a judge said at a bail hearing. Judge Renee Korn set Sharper's bail at $1 million and ordered him to stay away from venues that sold alcohol as a primary item. Prosecutors in Louisiana said the two alleged rapes occurred on September 23 in a New Orleans apartment. The alleged rapes in California occurred in October and last month, authorities said. Prosecutors there said the five-time Pro Bowl player, who became an NFL Network analyst, is also under investigation in Arizona and Nevada. Tempe, Arizona, police say they expect to file charges against Sharper soon. ""We have nothing yet. We anticipate filing charges very shortly and we are still waiting on a couple of results from the crime lab,"" said Sgt. Mike Pooley. In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. According to the report, the woman was with two friends at a Miami Beach club in September or October 2012 when she met Sharper. The woman, her friends and another person went to Sharper's condo, where the woman claims the battery took place. Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last week. One of Sharper's lawyers disputed all the rape allegations last week at his hearing. ""It was all consensual contact with women who wanted to be in his company,"" Leonard Levine said. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. CNN's Suzanne Presto, Michael Martinez and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","Darren Sharper now faces rape charges in two states .

"Kyoto, Japan (CNN) -- The newspapers and television news blaze with shocking images of crowds energized by fury, of buildings set aflame, of diplomatic missions under assault. It sounds very much like the Middle East, but it's happening in China, and the target of the mob violence in scores of Chinese cities is Japan and the Japanese. In both cases -- in the Middle East and East Asia -- the anger reflects a genuine, deeply felt indignation, but the protests have another powerful dimension. Political groups have turned religious or nationalist sensitivity into a weapon to further their objectives. Politicians are riding the tiger of popular wrath, hoping to guide it, to control it, to make it attack and wound their enemies, so they can gain an advantage and further their agenda. It's a perilous exercise. The tiger cannot be easily controlled. Just as the Muslim world seemed to explode with violent rage against America over a blasphemous film, tens of thousands of Chinese protesters also boiled with barely contained ferocity against an affront by a foreign power. It started after the Japanese government purchased from a private owner a set of uninhabited islands claimed by both countries. The obscure dispute over the cluster of rocky islets known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China has simmered for many decades. Now, it has turned into one of the most serious confrontations since the two countries established relations in 1972, pitting the two biggest economies in Asia -- No. 2 and No. 3 in the world -- with crowds of Chinese demonstrators calling for China to ""declare war"" against Japan -- and worse. As protests spread to a hundred Chinese cities, one sign chillingly suggested, ""We must exterminate the Japanese."" Protesters threw bottles, rocks and eggs at the Japanese embassy, they smashed and burned Japanese businesses and vehicles and cars, and they generally overflowed with barely concealed hatred, the flames stoked even higher on the anniversary of the 1931 ""Mukden incident"" that started Japan's invasion of China, the most sensitive spot in historical memory. The nationalist pride is real, but there is much more to the mayhem. Some of the same questions that have emerged from the anti-American violence in the Middle East are emerging in China. Is this all truly spontaneous? Is the timing purely coincidental? And, above all, who benefits? In the Middle East, the repellent little film that triggered Muslim anger was posted on YouTube on July 1. Although it apparently wasn't translated into Arabic until and aired on Egyptian TV around September 5, the surge of murderous attacks against U.S. diplomatic missions came, of all days, on September 11. In China, the conflict is happening just as the ruling Communist Party prepares for the 18th Party Congress, when a pivotal power handover is expected. The exact date remains unclear, but the country is swimming in speculation about mysterious power struggles as the gathering, possibly next month, approaches. In all the mayhem, one can spot the efforts by powerful forces to rile what used to be called ""the street."" In the Muslim world, Islamist parties have a firm tradition of anti-Western ideology. An American-made film insulting the prophet Muhammad can boost their support. The film is despicable, but with today's technology there will be someone, somewhere, saying or drawing or filming something offensive. Political and religious leaders have a choice of when to mobilize their followers. Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, who came from the Muslim Brotherhood, saw the tiger coming, and he tried to ride it. Last week, as protesters unleashed their ire in front of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, and news that extremists in Libya had killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Morsy's reaction was not to condemn the killings or the violations of a fundamental tenet of diplomacy and international law. Instead, he demanded the U.S. take legal action against the filmmaker. His Muslim Brotherhood sought to wave the banner in defense of Islam, initially calling for more protests. It took several days before Morsy, on a European tour, called the attacks on all embassies ""unacceptable."" If Egypt wants foreign investment, its government can't support attacks against foreign embassies. The entire Arab world is engaged in a crucial power struggle. The people are waging a historic battle to determine what role Islam will have in government, in daily life and in the law. Anti-Western protests, under the banner of defending Islam, amount to raucous political rallies in support of the more radical, anti-liberal positions. Those in power face a delicate situation. They want to wrap themselves in the flag of Islam, prevent their rivals on the right from gaining the upper hand but must avoid appearing irresponsible in the eyes of the international community, the support of which they need to stabilize their economies. Seeking to benefit from the intensity of emotions, Islamist militants such as Lebanon's Hezbollah called for more protests. The Chinese government also tried to calibrate resentments. Critics noted that in China's one-party system, you don't get a week of violent protests without government approval. Authorities stoked the flames with praise for the public's ""expression of patriotism,"" which the official media called ""reasonable"" and a ""natural reaction"" to Japan's provocation. Then, perhaps nervous that demonstrations might turn against the regime, they tried to throttle back the violence. Chinese dissidents examining pictures of the protests said they noticed government officials working the crowd. Massive, seemingly spontaneous protests can strengthen a government's hand against outsiders and has a rally-round-the flag effect that can strengthen a regime. But some speculated that hard-liners in the Communist Party were trying to bolster their position, perhaps trying to postpone the Party Congress and buy more time to organize. When the protests threatened to get out of hand and take a perilous economic toll, the government tried to pull back the reins. Japanese corporations, such as Honda, Panasonic, Sony and others shuttered operations in China, as the Japanese public, aghast, watched the scenes from just across the sea. Japan and China have more than $340 billion in trade. No government benefits, if the two economies are weakened. This latest fashion, blending domestic politics and diplomacy-by-mob, is a dangerous development. Politicians who try to ride the tiger of populist rage, whether in East Asia or the Middle East, will discover they can't always rein back the crowd's passions. They may want it to charge against their enemies. In the end, however, everyone could get mauled. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Furious protests denouncing another nation are happening in China as well as the Mideast .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Police in the Turkish city of Istanbul are dispersing crowds demonstrating against government corruption amid a growing political scandal in the nation. Police fired plastic bullets with white powder that makes people cough and used water cannon to disperse small groups of demonstrators trying to reach the city's Taksim Square. A high-level corruption investigation involving the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan sparked the anger against the government and caused the currency to drop against the dollar. The crisis intensified this week as three ministers stood down and one, Urbanization and Environment Minister Erdogan Bayraktar, called on the country's leader to follow suit. The ministers resigned Wednesday after their sons were detained in a roundup that included the head of a public bank, several bureaucrats and high-profile businessmen. The detentions came after a two-year investigation by the Istanbul Prosecutor's Office into allegations of corruption, including money laundering, gold smuggling and bribery. Protesters chanted ""government resign,"" and ""Help, there are thieves,"" and threw rocks and fireworks at the police, and erected barricades. Police warned demonstrators over loudspeakers to disperse. When they didn't, they ordered plainclothes police to begin detaining people. A heavy police presence on Taksim Square kept demonstrators from reaching that major city center. Istanbul's Gezi Park, the site of anti-government protests last spring, is completely cordoned off by riot police. Anti-government demonstrators protested plans to build a shopping mall at that site, and populist outrage at the government took hold. Erdogan on Friday again made reference to the demonstrations: ""Gezi was a plot, they weren't successful, they are trying this (corruption probe) now, but they will not succeed."" While Erdogan may face a challenge from the streets, the far greater threat to his authority may come from an erosion of support within his own camp. There were more resignations from his party Friday, including the former minister of culture, Ertugrul Gunay -- the third deputy to go this week. Prime minister lashes out . Erdogan was at the Istanbul airport making a speech to his supporters denying the corruption allegations and accusing foreign plotters and actors of trying to undermine his government. Earlier Friday, the Prime Minister lashed out at his own judiciary, accusing an Istanbul prosecutor of behaving like a buffoon. Erdogan is determined to discredit a corruption inquiry that continues to undermine the legitimacy of his government. Public prosecutors have publicly complained that they are unable to conduct a second wave of arrests in a wide ranging probe that includes bribery and the rigging of government tenders. Their hands have been tied by a directive which demands they seek approval from their superiors before interrogating suspect. That directive was declared invalid by the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors, the body which supervises the running of the courts. For the time being, the directive remains in effect. Prosecutor says he can't carry out an investigation . Turkish newspapers have reprinted a facsimile of a court order demanding that the Prime Minister's son report for questioning by January 2. Protesters chanted that police should arrest the son, Bilal, who is a businessman. Muammer Akkas, an Istanbul prosecutor complained Thursday that he had been removed from the case after police had refused to carry out orders to arraign suspects. He accused them of an obstruction of justice. ""All my colleagues and the public should be aware that I, as a public prosecutor, have been prevented from carrying out an investigation,"" he said in a written statement he distributed in front of a courthouse. Erdogan mocked that action in a speech Friday to a university audience. ""Are you a prosecutor or a flier distributor? You go out in front of the court house and distribute fliers?"" The courts have succeeded, according to the pro-government newspaper Haberturk, in enforcing an injunction that freezes the assets of seven businessmen behind Istanbul's construction boom, including the winner of the tender to construct a new airport for Istanbul. This will have an effect on the country's large construction industry, according to Atilla Yesiada, Turkish adviser for GlobalSource Partners. ""We really don't know if allegations ... of shady tenders are true or not, but as long as they remain in the air, banks and companies will find it very hard to renew their loans or to get new credit from external investors,"" he said. The military wants to stay out of the fray . Erdogan has, throughout his political career, faced the opposition of the Turkish military and is widely regarded to have finally averted that threat after a series of trials in which senior officers were sentenced for plotting the overthrow of his government. A statement Friday posted on the website of the Armed Forces re-confirmed the top brass' intention to steer clear of the current controversy. ""The Turkish armed forces does not want to, in anyway, be a part of political discussions,"" it said. Market confidence shaken . Erdogan's most difficult battle may be to regain market confidence. The crisis has slammed economic confidence in Turkey, sending the nation's currency to a record low and stocks plunging. The lira hit an all-time low against the dollar Friday. The key index for stocks on Turkey's main exchange, the Borsa Istanbul National 100, has slumped 6.2% this week and is down more than 18% this year. Erdogan reshuffled his cabinet, but the moves failed to restore investor confidence in the Turkish economy. Turkey is expected to hold local elections in 2014 and many analysts see those elections as a test of Erdogan's grip on power after a turbulent year of unprecedented anti-government protests.","The Turkish lira is dropping against the dollar .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- It's a life experience nobody would want to endure -- attending your child's funeral. But that's what some parents have had to do in Thailand in recent days, as the country's anti-government unrest has taken an increasingly ugly, more violent turn with children killed or injured, their tiny bodies maimed and turned lifeless by shrapnel or gunshots. A six-year-old-girl, a four-year-old boy and a woman of about 40 died when a grenade detonated at an anti-government rally outside a shopping mall in the Ratchaprasong area of Bangkok. A five-year-old girl was killed by a stray bullet when attackers opened fire on an anti-government demonstration in eastern Trat province. The two youngsters in the capital were siblings, the children of a working-class family. The father, Thayakorn Yotubon, works as a personal assistant and driver -- he told me he spent every single night with his children and would never leave them alone. In one of the photographs at his children's funeral, the little girl, nicknamed by her family as ""Cake,"" (the brother was known as ""Kane"") is wearing a t-shirt that says ""I love Papa."" ""She asked me to buy it for her to wear on Fathers' Day,"" he told me, tears rolling down his face. Special day out . The day they were caught in the attack was a special day out because their aunt was visiting from out of town. She had brought Cake, Kane and her son out for a treat to the local shopping mall. They were waiting for a tuk-tuk -- a rickshaw taxi -- when a grenade was thrown into the crowds close to an anti-government rally outside the mall. Cake and Kane died from their injuries. Their cousin, who is 8-years old, is in critical condition in a hospital. We found his small, blood-drenched baseball cap at the scene. I have been covering the Thai unrest story from various protest sites, especially outside government buildings, but this time it was at the funeral of two young children. As we looked on and filmed, I questioned if we should be there -- if we should be filming their grief. But the family invited the cameras in. They didn't stop us and all spoke to my team. Despite my moment of doubt, I knew this was an important aspect of this whole story that needs to be shown to those involved. As Thayakorn so clearly put it: ""My kids were just children, sweet children. They were too young, they should not have done this to them ...They were just innocent children, they had nothing to do with this (political issue)."" What's behind the Thai unrest? Their mother seated towards the back, was unable to bring herself to lift her head, wipe away her tears or talk to those sitting beside her. I watched as she was helped to her feet by family members, helping her take each shaky step towards her children's bodies. ""These are not my children,"" she cried. ""They don't look like that."" Children's bodies . Her children were laid out with their bodies bandaged and stitched together, their faces without expression, without the joy and happiness their father described to me. ""They were happy, innocent and sensitive kids,"" said Thayakorn. ""They loved to be around us -- their mum and dad all the time. They were sweet kids."" This was a Buddhist ceremony. During the last rites, family members pour water through the person's hands to symbolize the return of the body to the elements. But these hands were far too tiny, far too angelic, delicate and innocent to be there. I watched as the mother struggled to perform the ceremony. She couldn't look at their faces -- she wouldn't look -- unable to accept or bear the burden of this loss. Even the Buddhist monk appeared lost for words as he looked on. I have been told that Buddhist funerals in Thailand are often somber events, with little emotion and outward shows of grief. But the passing of two innocent children in such circumstances was too much for all in attendance. Family members and friends were so distraught they could not utter words of condolence or comfort to ease the mother and father's pain. And when the father came to perform the rituals -- he dropped to his knees, talking to his children. Crying out in disbelief: ""You were too young to die."" In this corner of the capital, at least one family had paid too high a price for the political turmoil sweeping across the country.","Brother and sister killed in grenade attack at shopping mall in Bangkok .

"New York (CNN) -- Whatever one thinks of Spike Lee's expletive-laced rant about moneyed newcomers inhabiting once-blighted corners of America's most populous city, the millionaire filmmaker could be considered a dubious messenger for such sentiments. ""You personally turned Brooklyn into the hottest spot creatively and politically and you move out,"" Errol Louis, a Brooklyn resident and political anchor at CNN affiliate NY1 News, said Thursday. ""What did you think was going to happen? You got rich selling this place. This is your brand and people who have a little money want to sort of take you up on it, and somehow that's a problem."" The famed director's lengthy tirade on the Dickensian ills of gentrification during an African-American History Month lecture Tuesday has drawn mixed reactions from various sectors of a rapidly changing city. ""You can't just come in the neighborhood like you're Columbus and kill off the Native Americans,"" Lee told his audience after a Brooklyn resident raised the subject of the ""other side"" of gentrification. Louis, in an opinion piece in the New York Daily News on Wednesday, called out Lee. ""It's the sacred right of every New Yorker to bewail, blame and bemoan the arrival of the folks who arrive in the neighborhood five minutes after we do, but somebody has to call bull on Lee's complaints about gentrification,"" he wrote. ""This is a man who has made epic contributions to the phenomenon he finds so troubling."" Case in point: Hatch House, Lee's 9,000-square-foot mansion on Manhattan's ritzy Upper East Side, Louis writes. The filmmaker bought the palace from artist Jasper Johns for $16 million in 2006 and recently put it on the market for $32 million. Lee bought a five-story townhouse in Fort Greene -- where the director grew up -- for $650,000 in 1990, according to published reports. Lee sold the place in 1999 to a banker married to an attorney for about $1 million and moved to his Upper East Side mansion. Lee also put his 40 Acres headquarters, a converted former firehouse in Brooklyn, up for sale at $6 million in 2008, published reports said. ""He's like a one-man marketing organization and he's brilliant at it,"" Louis, who has lived in Brooklyn for three decades, told CNN. On Wednesday, Lee told ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that he's not against new people moving into areas that were once predominantly poor and predominantly African-American. ""My problem is that when you move into a neighborhood, have some respect for the history, for the culture,"" Lee said. Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University's Wagner School of Public Service, said some of New York's most dilapidated neighborhoods have benefited from the city's enormous recovery since 2001. For example, many renovated sections of now trendy Williamsburg, Brooklyn, were vacant industrial spaces. Abandoned buildings in Harlem have been turned into attractive apartment houses. ""In many cases,"" Moss said, ""we have populations that are growing where there were no people before."" D.K. Smith, the Brooklyn homeowner and tech start-up director who asked the question that triggered Lee's tirade, on Thursday said that he looks forward to possibly partnering with the filmmaker to keep the gentrification debate going. ""People are concerned about the issue of affordable housing,"" he said. ""Where are people going to go? Spike made the point, 'I don't want to live in a city where every house is a $1 million or $3 million.' First of all, it's not going to be much of a city. We're going to lose the part of the city that makes it vibrant."" He added: ""I imagine there are many elitists who would love to be in a city where the cheapest house is $1 million, but what kind of city would that be? It certainly wouldn't be Brooklyn, and it certainly wouldn't be the New York we have now.""

"(CNN) -- Africa is buzzing with its own brand of innovation, taking existing technology and adapting it to new uses. Mobile technology, for example, has become a game changer in many parts of the continent, with cell phones being used for everything from transferring money to providing health care information. But Africa's resourcefulness goes far beyond the mobile phone, and according to Nigerian-American journalist Dayo Olopade, author of forthcoming book ""The Bright Continent,"" advanced economies can learn a thing or two from Africa's innovative spirit. ""There are ways of doing more with less that are very organic to the African ecosystem, and I think in general in the 21st century there's a very important recognition that we need to all do more with less, and where better to look that the place that has been doing this for centuries?"" said Olopade. CNN's Robyn Curnow sat down with Olopade to talk about what global businesses can learn from African innovation. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: So what you're saying is that African innovation can teach the rest of the world something? Dayo Olopade: That's right and it's very counter-intuitive to say that the place where we've poured trillions of dollars of aid, we've tried rock stars, we've tried celebrity-led campaign ads, we've tried all sorts of things to help Africa, but the tools to help Africa really lie within the region, and that's really not necessarily aid flows but human capital. It's a continent approaching a billion people, all of whom have something to say. It's a very young place -- I think something like 60% of the population is under 35 -- and so in the next decade we're going to see this generation really take advantage of what is both global technology and global ideas and what they're already working with on the ground and there are so many examples that I see all over the place. CNN: What are some of the examples? DO: Well, for one, I think technology is very different, the way that people use things is very different than in more advanced economies -- I like to call it the difference between a fat economy and a lean economy. In a fat economy, a bicycle is just a bicycle, or a cell phone is just a cell phone; in a lean economy, I've seen men in Kenya making phone chargers using their bicycles, where it's double use. Where electricity goes out and you have a cell phone that's out of juice, you can then plug your cell phone into a bike and peddle away and also charge your phone. So it's about recombination, recycling, innovative use of existing objects. I actually just heard about something here in South Africa which is a woman who created a washing machine using the vuvuzela, where she poked holes in it and it was something that could be used as a washing machine. CNN: What is somebody reading this book when it is published, sitting in London, going to take from a vuvuzela washing machine? They're not going to take the practicality of that -- what's going to make them say 'wow, I didn't know that?'

I think that people who have had to figure out ways to get by with a government that won't serve them, with roads that are bad or, as I said, electricity that's inconstant, they're finding ways around it, and again, if you can make it work in Africa, I think you can make it work anywhere.","Nigerian-American journalist Dayo Olopade is author of 'The Bright Continent'

"Washington (CNN) -- A government agency long associated with efforts to mediate and diffuse tense situations in communities helped organize rallies over the killing of Florida teen Trayvon Martin last year, a conservative leaning legal advocacy group claims. Judicial Watch circulated a press release and accompanying documents on Wednesday asserting that the Community Relations Service, a division of the Justice Department, sent a ""secret team"" of ""peacekeepers"" to Sanford, Florida, last March and April to work marches, demonstrations and rallies related to the explosive case that is now the subject of a murder trial. Timeline of early events in Trayvon Martin case . The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. It instead pointed CNN to the 45-year record of CRS, which was created by a provision included in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The CRS website describes itself as ""the only federal agency dedicated to assist state and local units of government, private and public organizations, and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, incidents, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony."" CRS conciliators are frequently seen at large marches and rallies, and have been present at countless protests, including those that occur every four years at the Democratic and Republican political conventions. Conservative groups have complained that the conciliators are secretive and do not talk to the media. Ex-Sanford police chief: Zimmerman probe 'taken away from us' The service maintains that it does not choose sides and ""uses impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution procedures to help local leaders resolve problems and restore stability."" Zimmerman, 29, is accused of second-degree murder in the February 26, 2012, death of Martin, 17. Defense attorneys argue Zimmerman shot Martin in self-defense after the Miami teenager charged him. Prosecutors argue he followed Martin through his neighborhood and shot him without provocation. Martin supporters argued Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, took advantage of what they considered loose Florida gun laws to racially profile and shoot an unarmed African-American teenager without provocation. The incident, inflamed by a lengthy delay before charges were filed against Zimmerman, provoked protests nationwide.

"(CNN) -- The expulsion of an international medical NGO providing a vital lifeline to displaced Muslims in Myanmar's Rakhine state has raised fears other aid agencies could be next. Advocates for the Rohingya Muslim minority -- tens of thousands of whom have been displaced by sectarian violence and are forced to live in sealed camps -- fear the move is part of a push by extremist Rakhine nationalists to cut off a lifeline to the persecuted ethnic group and help drive them from the state in western Myanmar. ""It is absolutely shocking, especially that the government seems to bow to the demands of protesters in the face of international human rights concerns,"" said Chris Lewa, founder of the Arakan Project, an NGO which advocates on the Rohingya issue. ""I'm really, really concerned, if the government is bowing to these extremists' requests, where it's going to go."" Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) was banned from operating in the volatile state last week, following protests by ethnic Rakhine nationalists against the organization and other international NGOs. Myanmar's government said the organization had been banned for consistently showing bias towards the state's Muslim minority and breaching the terms of its agreement to operate in Rakhine, where it provided services to tens of thousands of patients. Human Rights Watch slammed the move, with senior researcher David Mathieson describing the expulsion as ""simply deplorable."" Lewa said MSF was the major NGO provider of healthcare in the state and its expulsion would ""have devastating consequences on the Rohingya population,"" as well as impacting members of the Rakhine ethnic group which relied on its services. ""There is no other international NGO providing this kind of assistance,"" she said. She feared other aid agencies could be next to be targeted. ""The extremists have been protesting not only against MSF -- it has been against all international NGOs, the UN, even the ICRC,"" she said. She feared that cutting off international aid to the Rohingya -- many of whom were prevented from working by travel restrictions that leave them stranded in vast camps -- was part of a push by Rakhine extremists to hound them from the state. ""The most worrying thing is where is it going to stop."" READ MORE: Medecins Sans Frontieres banned in Rakhine state for alleged ""Rohingya bias"" The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority in Rakhine state, thought to number between 800,000 and one million. Myanmar does not recognize them as citizens or one of the country's 135 recognized ethnic groups. Much of this is rooted in their heritage in East Bengal, now called Bangladesh. Though many Rohingya have only known life in Myanmar, they are widely viewed as intruders from across the border. According to Human Rights Watch, laws discriminate against the Rohingya, infringing on their freedom of movement, education, and employment. They are denied land and property rights and ownership, and land on which they live can be taken away at any given time. Public sentiment against aid workers rose in the impoverished state in the second half of last year, according to the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Last week, aid agency Mercy Malaysia withdrew staff from Rakhine due to the heightened tensions, in a move it said was temporary. MSF has not commented on latest developments, other than to say it was ""deeply shocked"" and that its services were provided according to medical need only. READ MORE: Rights group alleges ""ethnic cleansing"" in Myanmar . But in an editorial submitted to regional newspapers last year, the organization's Myanmar operational manager Lauren Cooney addressed the accusations of bias that had been directed at the organization in the wake of two incidents of violence on November 2 that resulted in four deaths. MSF medical teams had transferred three injured Muslims to hospital after being notified by leaders of a displaced persons' camp, she wrote. The organization subsequently learned that injured Rakhine Buddhists had been ferried to hospital in a boat organized by their community. MSF staff would have assisted the injured Buddhists had they been notified, she wrote. Lewa said MSF's recent public comment on an alleged massacre at Du Chee Yar Tan village near the township of Maungdaw in January had exacerbated ill-feeling toward the group. The U.N. says at least 40 Rohingya men, women and children were killed by security forces and ethnic Rakhine assailants, but the government strongly denies the account. MSF drew criticism after it publicly stated it had treated 22 people in the area for weapon wounds after the alleged killing spree, with Myanmar's presidential spokesman Ye Htut previously telling CNN the comments had been the ""final straw"" for the Rakhine state government when it came to the NGO. ""The state government and local people think the MSF is intentionally creating tension in the community by spreading baseless information like this,"" he said, adding that he believed the government would be able to replace MSF's services itself. Htut did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.","There are fears NGOs could be expelled from Myanmar's volatile Rakhine state .

"(CNN) -- A Japanese rocket roared into orbit early Friday (Thursday afternoon ET) carrying what NASA calls its most precise instrument yet for measuring rain and snowfall. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite is the first of five earth science launches NASA has planned for 2014. The 4-ton spacecraft is the most sophisticated platform yet for measuring rainfall, capable of recording amounts as small as a hundredth of an inch an hour, said Gail Skofronick Jackson, GPM's deputy project scientist. The $900 million satellite is a joint project with the Japanese space agency JAXA, and it lifted off from Tanegashima Space Center at 3:37 a.m. Friday (1:37 p.m. Thursday ET). In a little over a half hour, it had reached orbit, deployed its solar panels and began beaming signals back to its controllers, NASA said. Also, once fully activated, GPM will use both radar and microwave instruments to detect falling snow for the first time. It will also combine data from other satellites with its own readings, beaming back a snapshot of worldwide precipitation every three hours, Jackson said. ""We can start using the data for all sorts of applications -- for floods, for landslide predictions, for tracking hurricanes so we know what part of the coastline to evacuate,"" Jackson said. That data will boost not only immediate storm forecasts, but also aid climate scientists who have been working on long-term models of a changing world. ""We can start validating and verifying what the scientists are saying from the models that say we're going to have more extreme precipitation,"" she said. ""Where there's heavy precipitation now, the climate models are saying there'll continue to be more intense precipitation there, and where there's droughts, they think the droughts will be more intense."" The craft has enough fuel for at least five years and is expected to last longer -- so when combined with earlier missions, it will give NASA an unbroken 25- to 30-year rainfall record, Jackson said.","Satellite will beam back the most precise measurements of rain and snow yet .

"(CNN) -- The life of rugby player Joost van der Westhuizen is the stuff films are made of -- literally. The 43-year-old was part of the South Africa team which won rugby union's World Cup on home soil in 1995 and received the trophy from the late president Nelson Mandela as the post-apartheid era dawned. The story of that victory was immortalized in acclaimed film ""Invictus"" and now, as he battles a life-threatening illness, Van der Westhuizen is drawing inspiration from that Latin word which means undefeated; unconquered. Van der Westhuizen was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, also known as ALS, in 2011. The man that famously muscled New Zealand rugby giant Jonah Lomu to the turf in the closely-fought 1995 World Cup final now uses a wheelchair to get around. His body is too frail to walk because the debilitating disease effects all physical movement, including speech. And the light and shade between his former glories and his present battle with illness is not unsurprisingly proving frustrating. ""It is,"" Van der Westhuizen told CNN's South Africa correspondent Robyn Curnow in a television interview where Van der Westhuizen's slurred speech has been subtitled. ""But then again, that's how my life is."" The memories of his stellar career -- the Springbok jerseys and silverware -- line the walls of Van der Westhuizen's home in South Africa. When he retired in 2003, he was the country's most capped player with a reputation as one of the most brilliant, and toughest, scrum halves in the history of the game. Francois Pienaar, who captained South Africa to success in 1995, described Van der Westhuizen as ""a phenomenal athlete."" ""What Joost did on the rugby field was incredible,"" Pienaar told CNN. ""He was probably the best number nine to play the game, and that's saying something."" Tough and tenacious on the rugby field, Van der Westhuizen is having to apply those skills in his fight to stay alive and help find a cure for motor neurone disease. ""I am,"" he assured CNN. ""Without a doubt. I am a self-confessed bad loser and I want to beat this not just for myself but for everyone with ALS around the world."" Van der Westhuizen has started a foundation called J9 to raise money and awareness of motor neurone disease. The foundation offers support and advice to patients and their families as they come to terms with a disease which has no clear cause. A J9 legends team -- boasting over 500 international caps between them -- was cheered on by Van der Westhuizen in the veterans' tournament at November's Dubai round of the HSBC Sevens World Series. He still travels around the world, often connecting with his old rugby rivals for fundraising events as well as making regular medical research trips to the United States. It isn't just Van der Westhuizen's global mission which keeps him pressing on with his crusade. ""I am doing this to give my children a dad for longer,"" he says. ""My daughter is eight, my son 10. They need a dad."" It is for this reason that Van der Westhuizen has revealed that he has decided to be artificially ventilated when his lungs are no longer able to function on their own. It is a huge step for Van der Westhuizen given it's not common practice in his native South Africa. ""I am going to live as long as possible -- to help find a cure, to give my kids a dad,"" he said, confirming that he has made a decision about using an artificial ventilation machine, which will aid his breathing and help him stay alive . ""There is nothing wrong with my brain or my heart. I am still alive."" Already a figure in one of South Africa's most historic sporting events, Van der Westhuizen is determined to defy the odds and help make history a second time.","Joost van der Westhuizen is a former South Africa rugby player fighting motor neurone disease .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton told an audience last month that she is not thinking about her 2016 presidential plans and told supporters ""not to think about it."" Nonetheless, they're laying the groundwork necessary to activate a campaign in a not-so-subtle attempt to convince her to run. The party that was once known for duplicating efforts and an inability to accept the realities of federal election law believes it has found its groove with a cadre of organizations working in concert to elect the first woman president. ""Everybody is swimming in their own lane, which is very unusual for Democrats,"" said Paul Begala, head of pro-Clinton Priorities USA Action and a CNN contributor. ""Usually Democrats bump into each other all the time."" Does Obama secretly support Hillary Clinton for 2016? The message from pro-Clinton Democrats is that each group has their own goal: Priorities USA Action deals with high-dollar fundraising and making ads; Ready for Hillary builds grassroots support and a sizable e-mail list; Emily's List grows excitement in electing a woman president; and Correct the Record handles messaging, research and rapid response to attacks from opponents. In South Carolina, Clinton forces try to tap Obama magic . Group known for backing Hillary Clinton also defends Biden . Each group's early efforts are unprecedented -- especially considering Clinton has yet to announce her presidential intentions -- causing some senior Democrats to worry that focusing on 2016 is taking Democrats' focus off the 2014 midterms with the balance of power in the Senate at stake. Bill Clinton hits midterm trail with an eye on 2016 . But what really sets these coordinated efforts apart are the close personal ties between organizations and a super PAC board that's stacked with a who's who list of pro-Clinton operatives. The pro-Clinton board . When Priorities USA Action announced its new board last month, most on the list were either picking up a paycheck, closely tied to or advising one of the groups urging Clinton to run. Allida Black, the chairperson of Ready for Hillary, is on the board. So is David Brock, the prolific fundraiser behind the liberal super PACs American Bridge and Correct the Record. Also earning a seat: Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily's List, and Harold Ickes, a longtime Clinton confidant and an adviser to Ready for Hillary. The announcement made it clear that the Priorities board is shaping up to become the nexus of the groups pushing a Clinton campaign. ""If you look at our board, the Priorities board, that is coordination incarnate. That is coordinating,"" Begala said. ""This is where a lot of conversation occurs. That, I think, shows the connection and the cooperation on my side."" And a number of sources close to the process of putting the Priorities board together said the intent was to center the body around these pro-Clinton groups. The coordination extends to President Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Earlier this year, Priorities made a big splash when it named Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, as the board's co-chairman. The move had some political experts questioning whether Messina's move to Priorities was a tacit presidential endorsement for Clinton. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that Messina is ""an independent American citizen"" who is ""not affiliated with the President, the White House."" Messina has started with the super PAC, including working with the new board. So far, the board has had a handful of conference calls and the expectation is there will be regular interaction between the pro-Clinton operatives. Even longtime Democratic operatives like Brock say, ""This kind of cooperation on behalf of a unified Democratic front is unprecedented."" The longstanding relationships . Also at play is the web of friends, confidants and former colleagues that have staffed the groups. Many of the top strategists at each organization have worked together, some for decades. Each organization said the trust between these individuals makes it easier to coordinate. ""If you have been in this town long enough, you have worked on the Hill, you have worked in politics, chances are you have almost worked with everyone in your age group in that level,"" said a source at Correct the Record. ""With that, the line between work drinks and drinks with friends is oftentimes one in the same."" With this familiarity comes an ease and, sometimes, an expectation that the Democratic operatives with a common goal will help each other out. Adam Parkhomenko, founder of Ready for Hillary, and other members of the super PAC's staff have a weekly call with American Bridge and Correct the Record. When Emily's List has an event for Madame President -- the group's initiative to elect a woman president -- Ready for Hillary will get an early heads-up. Parkhomenko had lunch with Buffy Wicks, the executive director for Priorities USA Action, in early February, shortly after Priorities made clear it would be a pro-Clinton group with a focus on 2016. The lunch was set up in an effort to strengthen bonds between the groups and make sure the organizations weren't stepping on each others toes. ""They trust each other, they have worked with each other for a long time,"" said a source at Ready for Hillary. ""It just makes it easier to work together."" The problems . Some senior Democratic operatives think that focusing on 2016 this early is a distraction from the upcoming 2014 midterm elections. Earlier this month, Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and a longtime Clinton supporter, sent off a trio of tweets pushing operatives, fundraisers and donors to not lose focus on 2014. ""To those who are #ReadyforHillary, we've got another job to do before 2016,"" said one. ""To the donors who want to expand the electorate, fight voter suppression laws & win in 2014, we need your help now,"" said another. Cecil's job is to protect their blue majority in the Senate. Democrats also hope to win back the House in 2014, but the chances of that look dim. David Axelrod, Obama's former campaign manager, tweeted earlier this month, ""With the Senate seriously at risk, and the Koch Brothers spending prodigiously, shouldn't Dem funders be focused on '14 and not '16 races?"" In reaction, Wicks sent out a memo to Priorities USA supporters making it clear that the Democratic super PAC would not be sitting out the 2014 midterms. ""No one should sit out the 2014 midterm elections, period,"" Wicks wrote. ""Priorities USA Action, which was founded to preserve, protect and defend the Obama presidency, was not born with an eye toward congressional races. However, the upcoming midterm elections are so critical for our future and the ability of the next President to govern that we must engage."" There are other problems that come with amassing a campaign infrastructure without having a candidate. Namely: What happens if Clinton decides not to run? While many friends and confidants believe Clinton will run, most tell CNN that she has yet to decide. There are Democrats waiting in the wings, but almost all Democratic focus for 2016 has been trained on Clinton. A CNN/ORC International Poll released earlier this month showed 70% of Democrats would support Clinton's nomination in 2016. Poll: If not Clinton, then what kind of Democrat? CNN/ORC Poll: Christie's loss appears to be Clinton's gain . The pro-Clinton groups have said they would help other Democrats should Clinton not run. Ready for Hillary would use the substantial e-mail list it has amassed to help different state parties and candidates. Earlier this year, Correct the Record showed it was a team player by defending Vice President Joe Biden against Republican attacks. The groups are staffed by Clinton loyalists and all hope the former first lady will run. If Clinton doesn't run, the resources amassed to help her will be in question. The irony . Back in 2010, the Supreme Court open the floodgates to outside campaign spending in their Citizens United ruling. At the time, Democrats derided the decision as ""bad for American Democracy"" and Obama bashed the ruling in his State of the Union address. Conservative groups seized the opportunity and spent millions of dollars in support of Republican campaigns. Conservative super PACs outspent liberal groups by a 3-2 margin, $36.7 million to $24.6 million, according to analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. That gap grew to 2-1 of the $609 million raised by super PACs in 2012. Although many pro-Clinton Democratic operatives say they wish big money was not a part of politics, the pro-Clinton groups have embraced the law. Advisers close to the groups equate the supervision from the Federal Election Commission to the ""Wild West,"" where little is off-limits and groups can have a sizable impact years out from Election Day 2016. ""You have to play the game with the rules as they are,"" said the Priorities source. ""We can't unilaterally disarm."" A source close to Ready for Hillary said they're using ""Citizens United ruling to benefit Democrats. We wouldn't be doing this if we didn't believe it could work."" Rubio on 2016: Clinton would 'struggle' Biden on 2016: If Hillary runs, it won't affect my decision . Jeb on Bush family name: 'It's an issue' Christie's poll numbers still tumbling .

"(CNN) -- According to a TIME/Pew research poll released last week, 40 percent of Americans believe that marriage is becoming obsolete, up from just 28 percent in 1978. In that same poll, only one in four unmarried Americans say they do not want to get married. And among currently married men and women, 80 percent say their marriage is as close as or closer than their parents' marriage. These seemingly contradictory responses reflect the public's recognition of a new and complex reality. On the one hand, marriage as a voluntary relationship based on love and commitment is held in higher regard than ever, with more people saying that love is essential to marriage (Consider that in 1967, two-thirds of college women said they'd consider marrying a man they didn't love if he met other criteria, such as offering respectability and financial security.) But as an institution that regulates people's lives, marriage is no longer the social and economic necessity it once was. People can construct successful lives outside marriage in ways that would have been very difficult to manage 50 years ago, and they have a far greater range of choices about whether to marry, when to marry, and how to organize their marriages. This often makes them more cautious in committing to marriage and more picky about their partners than people were in the past. In the 1950s, when half of all American women were already married in their teens, marriage was an almost mandatory first step toward adulthood. It was considered the best way to make a man grow up, and in an economy where steady jobs and rising real wages were widely available, that often worked. For a woman, marriage was deemed the best investment she could make in her future, and in a world where even college-educated women earned less than men with a only a high school education, that often worked for her too. Marriage was also supposed to be the only context in which people could regularly have sex or raise children. Divorced or unmarried men were routinely judged less qualified for bank loans or job promotions, sexually active single women were stigmatized, and out-of-wedlock children had few legal rights. Today, however, there are plenty of other ways to grow up, seek financial independence, and meet one's needs for companionship and sex. So what might have seemed a ""good enough"" reason to enter marriage in the past no longer seems sufficient to many people. Marriage has become another step, perhaps even the final rather than the first step, in the transition to adulthood -- something many people will not even consider until they are very sure they are capable of taking their relationship to a higher plane. Couples increasingly want to be certain, before they marry, that they can pay their bills, that neither party is burdened by debt, that each has a secure job or a set of skills attesting to their employability. Many are also conscious that as rigid gender roles erode, marriage demands more negotiation and relationship skills than in the past. They often want firsthand experience with how their partner will behave in an intimate relationship, which is why the majority of new marriages come after a period of cohabitation, according to census figures. These higher expectations are good news for many marriages. People who can meet the high bar that most Americans now feel is appropriate for the transition to marriage -- people who delay marriage to get an education, who have accumulated a nest egg or established themselves in a secure line of work -- typically have higher quality marriages than other Americans, research shows, and their divorce rates have been falling for the past 25 years. But these higher expectations pose difficulties for individuals with fewer interpersonal and material resources. Over the past 30 years, job opportunities and real wages have declined substantially for poorly educated men, making them less attractive marriage partners for women. When such men do find stable employment, they often tend to be more interested in a woman with good earnings prospects than someone they have to rescue from poverty. Today, several studies have shown, economic instability is now more closely associated with marital distress than it used to be. If a low-income woman finds a stable, employed partner, she will likely be better off by marrying. But if the man she marries loses his job or is less committed and responsible than she had hoped, she may end up worse off than before -- having to support a man who can't or won't pull his own weight. So the widening economic gap between haves and have-nots that America has experienced in recent decades is increasingly reflected in a widening marriage gap as well. Today two-thirds of people with a college degree are married, compared with less than half of those with a high school degree or less. Those who begin married life with the most emotional and material advantages reap the greatest gains in those same areas from marriage. The very people who would benefit most from having a reliable long-term partner are the ones least likely to be able to find such a partner or sustain such a relationship. This is a troubling trend that deserves attention from policy-makers. But the problem does not lie in a lack of family values. The poor value marriage just as highly as anyone else, and they may value children even more. Unfortunately, they are now less and less likely to believe they will be able to live up to the high expectations of modern partnerships, even if they are in love. There is no easy fix for this problem. But the good news is that families still matter to Americans, including those who are not married. According to the Pew poll, 76 percent of Americans say family is the most important, meaningful part of their life. Seventy-five percent say they are ""very satisfied"" with their family life. And 85 percent say that the family they live in today, whatever its form, is as close as or closer than the family in which they grew up. We have a lot of challenges ahead of us, but that's comforting news. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Coontz.","40 percent of adults in study say marriage becoming obsolete, yet most say they want to marry .

"(CNN) -- It should be a shining light in leading football forward, but FIFA has an ""ugly"" culture according to one former leading administrator. The game's ruling body has been beset by a number of scandals in recent years, and most recently has been fiercely criticized for its decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar amid allegations of worker abuse within the Gulf state. ""I thought it was a very difficult body to deal with -- I think its culture is very ugly,"" David Triesman, who was the English Football Association's chairman from 2008-10, told CNN in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. As part of the failed bid to bring the 2018 World Cup to England, Triesman spent countless days dealing with FIFA -- an organization which he believes needs a metaphorical clearing out of the Augean Stables if it is to repair its tarnished image. Directly in Triesman's firing line was FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who at the age of 77 is in his fourth and, he claimed when re-elected in 2011, final term of office. Culture change . ""It's made up of people who have been there for decades in some cases. I think the thing about old dogs not learning new tricks is true,"" said Triesman, who quit his FA role under a cloud of controversy after reportedly criticizing rival World Cup host candidates. ""I must say that I think the hardest thing in the world is change a culture. You can change processes, but changing cultures is very hard."" Triesman has some experience in fighting an established culture -- he was the first chairman elected outside of the FA's hierarchy, having previously been a government minister. ""I think to change a culture, then a significant amount of these people have to go. There has to be a fresh start. They won't like that -- they've never liked it when it has been said,"" said the 69-year-old, who subsequently returned to politics with the Labour Party. ""You don't change deep and unacceptable cultures by tinkering with them."" FIFA offered no comment when asked by CNN to provide a response to Triesman's observations. The Qatar condundrum . The plan to hold the 2022 World Cup in the desert heat is now under a review in consultation with the ""main stakeholders for the Qatar 2022 dates."" The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments is also being investigated. Michael Garcia, a former New York attorney, is head of the investigative arm of FIFA's ethics committee and will visit all of the countries involved in the process, beginning in London. Garcia has always insisted he is completely independent from FIFA and would not hesitate to take action against Blatter or other top FIFA officials if he found evidence that they broke the rules. While Blatter has confirmed there is no chance of the tournament being taken away from Qatar, he recently admitted that it may have been a mistake to have agreed to hold it in the nation's summer. ""The mistake was to think that we could play this competition easily in the summertime,"" he said. ""There are some doubts as to whether it is a good period to play in this heat."" Laughing . But Triesman is still bewildered by the decision to award the 2022 event to Qatar. ""I've never believed it. I almost fell over laughing when Sepp Blatter announced he didn't know how hot it was in Qatar at that time of year,"" he said. ""There are unpredictable things in life but the temperature in the Gulf in the summer is not one of those. It's one of the things you can bet your mortgage on every year. ""I wonder whether people are genuinely that foolish -- I don't believe they are or whether they were cynical and always knew it would have to move. ""If it does then it will cause massive disruption, not just to the football leagues but also to the other sports which come to their peaks at the winter. ""I think it's going to be a very costly and difficult move to organize but if it's in Qatar, it's going to be in the winter. ""Even if you could cool the players, and I'm not 100% sure of that, I wouldn't want to be a fan in the fan park in those temperatures. ""Anybody who tells me they can cool the fan park in Qatar, which is a country I know quite well from my days in the foreign office, I'll tell them they're deluded."" Harold Mayne-Nicholls, who led the FIFA inspection team examining the bidding countries for the 2022 World Cup, delivered his report in October 2010. He concluded that Qatar was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. Two ExCo members were suspended before the vote after allegations of bribery from a British newspaper, and the following year Triesman told a UK parliament committee that four FIFA officials had asked for certain favors in exchange for their votes. ""In June and July you cannot play,"" Mayne-Nicholls told CNN Wednesday, when asked about the conditions in Qatar. ""It's not for the players. The players will be OK with the cooling system but what about the fans? ""You'll have 50,000 fans walking three, four, even six blocks or more like in South Africa where I walked 10 blocks. ""They will be walking in 40 degrees and it's too much. One or two crucial cases will damage the entire image of the World Cup and we must be careful."" Entrapment . Triesman was forced to stand down from his role as chairman at the FA after a case which he labeled as ""entrapment"" led to a newspaper article suggesting he said Spain could drop its bid if rival bidder Russia helped bribe referees at the 2010 World Cup. He rebutted the claim and issued a strongly-worded statement denying the allegations. Triesman admitted that the FA and FIFA have endured a difficult relationship over the years. That relationship soured once more in 2011 when Triesman's successor, David Bernstein, called for the 208 FIFA nations not to re-elect Blatter unopposed -- a move which failed dismally. At the time FIFA's senior vice-president Julio Grondona hit out at the FA, claiming: ""England is always complaining. ""We always have attacks from England which are mostly lies with the support of journalism which is more busy lying than telling the truth. This upsets and disturbs the FIFA family. ""To present such a project as David Bernstein presented is like shooting a penalty because it cannot be always from the same place that the insults and problems come from. ""I see it at every congress. They have specific privileges with four countries having one vice-president. I don't know what our president has said. ""But we have seen the World Cup go around the world, to South America and Africa, and it looks like this country does not like it. ""It looks like England is always complaining so please I say will you leave the FIFA family alone, and when you speak, speak with truth."" No love lost . While Triesman hopes that the relationship between the two bodies has improved in the past year or two, he says there is not much love lost when it comes to his former employers and Blatter. ""My experience is that FIFA does not like the FA,"" he added. ""The FA is, for quite understandable reasons, very suspicious of FIFA. Sometimes it is arrogant about FIFA and that's not good from the FA's point of view, although I hope in recent years we haven't been. ""Here's just a little example. Whenever Sepp Blatter used the phrase 'The FA' he would always do it with an incredible kind of sneer and usually use a funny, jokey voice. ""He didn't believe anybody was entitled to call themselves 'The FA' even if it was the first. ""He thought it should be called 'The English FA' and didn't think we should have any sort of standing that suggested that our history was that important. ""It may feel very trivial but it's actually a view that we're not entitled to our standing."" David Triesman was speaking at the FourFourJew Exhibition at the Jewish Museum in Camden, London. The exhibition is open from October 10, 2013 until February 23, 2014.","Former English Football Association chairman labels culture of FIFA as ""ugly""

"(CNN) -- A manufacturer that has been inscribing Bible references on rifle sights used by U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan announced Thursday that it will stop putting scripture references on products the U.S. military uses. Gen. David Petraeus, commander of United States Central Command, said Wednesday -- apparently before learning of the company's announcement -- that the references were a ""big concern"" to the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, which have contracts for the scopes. ""I hope you can sense ... this is of serious concern to me and the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it can indeed create a perception that is absolutely contrary to what it is that we have sought to do,"" he said. He said U.S. troops are much more sensitive ""about this kind of thing,"" apparently, than is the contractor involved. On its Web site Wednesday, the Muslim Public Affairs Council said the references ""feed into the violent extremists' narrative that the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are a 'crusade against Islam.' "" Trijicon Inc., the manufacturer, said in a written statement that it has ""offered to voluntarily stop putting references to scripture on all products manufactured for the U.S. military -- and will provide, free of charge, 100 modification kits to the Pentagon to enable the removal of the references that are already on products that are currently deployed."" There was no immediate reaction from the Pentagon in response to the announcement, but a response was being prepared, Maj. Shawn Turner in the Department of Defense's public affairs office told CNN. The Marine Corps said it was ""concerned"" when it learned about the biblical references. ""We are making every effort to remove these markings from all of our scopes and will ensure that all future procurement of these scopes will not have these types of markings,"" it said in a written statement. ""We will remove the markings from the scopes currently delivered. Trijicon will also remove the markings from all scopes that have not been delivered."" Earlier, after it emerged that the Michigan-based manufacturer was putting codes for scriptures on the scopes, Trijicon issued a statement saying that it has put scripture references on its products for more than two decades. ""As long as we have men and women in danger, we will continue to do everything we can to provide them with both state-of-the-art technology and the never-ending support and prayers of a grateful nation,"" it said Wednesday. ABC first reported the story on Monday, saying that some of the citations on the sights included ""2COR4:6,"" an apparent reference to 2 Corinthians 4:6 of the New Testament, which reads, ""For God, who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ."" Another, according to ABC, included JN8:12, apparently referring to John 8:12. That reads, ""When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.' "" Trijicon has a $660 million contract for the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army, according to Turner. He said slightly more than 300,000 scopes have been delivered so far, with most going to the Marines. After the initial news report, the Muslim Public Affairs Council called on Defense Secretary Robert Gates to withdraw from combat use weapons that have sights with the biblical references. ""Allowing religious references to be placed on U.S. weaponry, which are bought and paid for by U.S. taxpayers, is unacceptable,"" MPAC Executive Director Salam Al-Marayati wrote in a letter to Gates, according to the council's Web site. ""Such inscriptions not only run afoul of the Constitution and U.S. military rules, but they also feed into the violent extremists' narrative that the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are a 'crusade against Islam.' ""","Trijicon Inc. offers not to put them on new scopes, alteration kits for deployed ones .

"(CNN) -- Personal trainer Cornell McClellan was working out with President Obama one morning when he had a revelation. ""Being a personal trainer is just like being the president,"" McClellan told Obama, whom he has trained for 11 years. That certainly got the president's attention. ""We're faced with similar things,"" McClellan said. ""We have people that come to us, and they've created conditions or situations that maybe we've had nothing to do with, and immediately they want us to change it. Even if they don't do what they're supposed to, they're upset with us when it's not changed. So I thought our jobs were pretty similar."" McClellan spoke at last month's American Council on Exercise conference in San Diego, where he thanked fellow personal trainers who donated their time to help military families get fit. McClellan splits his time between Chicago and Washington, where he helps the Obamas and key members of the administration stay in shape. The imposing former martial arts guru is one man in the world who can tell the president what to do -- at least when it comes to exercise. ""If we're short on time, we try to mix things up,"" he said. ""We'll try to make sure there's some high-intensity stuff. We might do some weights, throw some cardio in there and throw some plyometrics in there with abs. We go from one thing he needs to another, because his time is short."" The president is in tiptop shape age 50. Obama passed a physical exam in October with a healthy body mass index and normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The doctor wrote that Obama was in ""excellent health and 'fit for duty.' "" ""I was very pleased,"" McClellan said. ""We joked about it."" And McClellan is no doubt pleased with Michelle Obama's much-coveted arms, which are so admired that they have spawned exercise DVDs with titles like ""Arms of a First Lady"" and ""Totally Toned Arms: Get Michelle Obama Arms in 21 Days."" Although it's easy to say that the presidential couple can get in shape easily because of their resources such as personal trainers and professional chefs, it's not just about that. McClellan said busy people can realistically integrate fitness into their lives because it's a mental thing. ""He is the busiest man in the world,"" McClellan said of the president. ""I don't have to prod him."" The excuses -- too busy, too little time -- just don't fly with McClellan. Long before the White House, the Obamas made their health a priority. Michelle Obama came to his Chicago gym 14 years ago, and her husband joined about three years later. Before she became first lady, she would go to McClellan's gym as early as 4:45 a.m. It's about a mindset, McClellan said. ""People have to first understand the benefits,"" said McClellan, who serves on the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition. By exercising and reaping its benefits on health and stress relief, he said, ""it is how we can maintain these busy lives, and how we can sustain them.""","Cornell McClellan has trained the Obamas for over 10 years .
The biggest barrier to exercise is mental, he said .

"(CNN) -- When Pope Francis gave his now-famous, 80-minute interview on the plane back to Rome from Brazil, he was asked, not surprisingly, about the role of women in the Roman Catholic Church. He said that John Paul II had ""closed the door"" to the possibility of women priests, but he affirmed that the church lacked ""a deep theology of women."" His comments conveyed a deep respect for women. Whatever Francis' own virtues, however, the church will continue to be accused of sexual discrimination, especially by many Americans and Europeans, as long as it denies the priesthood to women. No matter what efforts Pope Francis makes with respect to women, if he refuses to move the ordination question forward, many, including Catholics, will consider his efforts toward women as insufficient or even hypocritical. That John Paul II ""closed the door"" to women's ordination is undoubtedly true, but the door may not be closed for all time. After John Paul II's pronouncement against the ordination of women, the Catholic Theological Society of America, the country's leading professional society of Roman Catholic theologians, at its June 1997 meeting, endorsed a resolution indicating that there are ""serious doubts regarding the nature of the authority of the teaching"" that the church lacks the authority to ordain women to the priesthood and that the all-male priesthood is a truth that has been infallibly taught and that the faithful must accept. What we learned about Pope Francis in Brazil . The resolution continued that ""there is serious, widespread disagreement on this question not only among theologians, but also within the larger community of the Church,"" and recommended it be given further ""study, discussion and prayer."" But the ordination of women is not the most pressing question for most Catholics or even for most Catholic women. Women also experience discrimination and exclusion in the secular sphere in the United States and Europe, but their exclusion and discrimination in the developing world are far greater. Throughout the world, women and their children make up the greatest percentage of human beings living in destitution. Their main concern is not women priests but food, health, education and physical safety. Francis' genuine concern for the real lives of the poor and suffering warmly embraces women. Pope Francis is charting new territory. I don't know how Pope Gregory the Great acted out his self-understanding of the pope as the ""servant of the servants of God"" -- the humble designation he first used -- in the sixth century, but clearly Francis sees himself as a leader who is committed to serving. Many commentators have pointed out his letting go of the material trappings of hierarchy and exclusion, from Prada shoes to papal apartments, and they have commented favorably on his compassion for the poor, his desire to lead all the faithful to a discipleship of service. Francis clearly sees himself as a disciple, and wishes to set an example like that of his namesake, from Assisi, who said, ""Preach the Gospel, using words when necessary."" Opinion: What do pope's remarks on gays mean? Will Pope Francis advance the conversation regarding the ordination of women? I suspect he will not. But I think his behavior toward all, from the most powerful to the least, but acting very explicitly without judgment and with love and compassion on behalf of the least -- most of whom are women -- will ""open the door"" to future conversation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alice L. Laffey.","Alice L. Laffey: Pope Francis says Catholic Church needs ""deep theology of women""
But she says many will accuse church of discrimination as long as it denies women priesthood .
She says jury still out: By some theological readings, women not precluded from priesthood .

"(The Frisky) -- Yes, yes, James Franco is going to Yale, the third stop on his tour of schools in the tri-state area -- before graduating from Columbia and going all Ivy League business, Franco had a brief fling with New York University. Amongst those precious days he spent at the latter, I was fortunate enough to share an elevator with him on the way to one of my classes. He was disheveled, kind of unwashed, but still pretty sexy. Most importantly, he spoke to me. He greeted me and asked me to press a button for his floor, and I pushed that button with more glamor, class, and subtle sex appeal than I have ever shown in any previous elevator-related activities. Throughout this enchanted encounter, I felt gifted and starstruck, but I didn't really feel like Franco had a way with words. Apparently, he's out to prove me wrong because he has been hard at work on a collection of short stories called Palo Alto -- one of the stories, ""Just Before the Black,"" was featured in the recent issue of Esquire. Here are some highlights: It features a dragon bong, has a 268-word sentence, and also has quite a collection of f-bombs. The story has received an array of reviews, and most suggest that Franco's fiction probably wouldn't have been published without the acting career. Ouch! Let's hope the book gets a little more enthusiasm. Of course, Franco is nowhere near the first celebrity to take on fiction.

"(CNN) -- Designer and TV host Nate Berkus is a member of the American Red Cross Celebrity Cabinet, which helps to highlight the organization's initiatives and response efforts. Founded in 1881, the American Red Cross is part of a worldwide movement that offers humanitarian care to victims of war and natural disasters. Berkus recently spoke with CNN's Allie Torgan about his personal connection to the Red Cross and how he is giving back. Below are excerpts from that interview. Allie Torgan: Why are you involved with the Red Cross? Nate Berkus: I have a very personal connection to the Red Cross because when I survived the tsunami -- the Indian Ocean tsunami, which was seven years ago now -- the Swiss Red Cross was the first sign of help that I saw with my own eyes. The sad part for me was that my partner, who I was traveling with to a tiny surfing village in Sri Lanka, didn't survive ... like many, many other people. And it was really an eye-opening experience for me ... and a soul-opening experience for me because I think we really don't know who we are until we don't have the resources that we need. Torgan: How did that experience affect you? Berkus: For me, having survived a natural disaster of that magnitude, there are things that happen that you don't even think about. Sometimes you just need a pair of flip-flops so that your feet aren't cut as you're walking around in the debris. Sometimes you need the equivalent of $5 in foreign currency to make a phone call to tell the people that love you you're OK or that somebody you love is not OK. And sometimes you need somebody just to give you a pencil and a piece of paper so that you can write down important details ... things that are flying through your mind like your passport number. I went through a very long period of grief and also sort of re-acclimating myself to what the reality of my life was. Torgan: What is your role as a member of the Celebrity Cabinet? Berkus: The main goal for me is to raise awareness of what the Red Cross does. I think especially at this time of the year, we all have so many holiday traditions. ... And if one of those traditions as families could be to volunteer or donate blood to the Red Cross as part of everything that we take for granted in this season, it would be really amazing. That kind of thinking is what being on the Celebrity Cabinet is all about. And obviously with the visibility that I'm lucky enough to have -- having a daily talk show and being able to meet people all across the country -- it's a way for me to give back to an organization that gave me something when I didn't have anything. Torgan: Why are you involved in the CNN Heroes campaign? Berkus: I think the Heroes campaign is really great because it highlights everyday people that we relate to, and it brings them to a place where they're getting recognition. But even as you're watching, you know that the recognition is not what they are after. What they're after was the deed that they chose to do. There's so much on TV ... so much passive, yucky stuff that just fills our brain with things that don't inspire us at all. And to watch somebody doing something for somebody else -- completely selflessly, having no idea that they would be chosen by CNN to be a Hero -- is something that's worthwhile for everyone to watch.","Designer Nate Berkus survived the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, but his partner did not .

"(CNN) -- With time ticking by and an apparent dearth of clues, an eastern Montana family clung Thursday to hopes of finding a 43-year-old schoolteacher, last seen five days earlier out on a morning jog through her small town. An FBI official noted that investigators have received ""dozens and dozens"" of calls about Sherry Arnold, agency spokeswoman Deborah Bertram said Thursday by e-mail. But the woman remains at large, and there are no named suspects in her disappearance. ""Our thoughts are focused on her, we want her to return, we want to get her back,"" her husband, Gary Arnold, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Thursday. ""That's what keeps hope alive."" Sherry Arnold went running around 6:30 a.m. Saturday, but never returned home, the FBI said. Other than one of her running shoes that was found along her route, authorities have not indicated there's been any sign of Arnold. This is despite an extensive search effort launched by authorities and aided by throngs of people around the area. Sidney police Chief Frank DiFonzo said earlier this week that teams had been using dogs and aircraft and have gotten help from National Guard members as well as volunteers. Christine Mullen, 26, a CNN iReport contributor, said earlier this week that she went to the site of one of the searches, where thousands turned up to help. Some set out on horses, others on ATVs and more on foot covering ""a lot of pasture, dirt roads and farmland."" Arnold's disappearance has hit the small community hard, including at Sidney High School, where she is a math teacher. Situated near North Dakota and about 100 miles south of the Canadian border, Sidney has a population of just under 5,200 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ""Everybody is involved,"" said Mullen, adding she doesn't know Arnold but still feels the impact. ""We're such a small community, and crime is absolutely unheard of,"" Mullen said. ""We don't lock our car doors. (We're) completely shocked."" But this type of extensive effort was called off Wednesday, when the FBI announced that ""law enforcement officials determined the prudent course of action is to scale back the ground search."" The focus, instead, will shift toward ""other investigative efforts,"" though the FBI did not specify in its statement what those would be. ""I think the FBI is on top of it, as much as they can be,"" said Gary Arnold, adding that he believed his wife's running route has been ""very, very thoroughly searched."" ""They're going to do the right thing and ask the right questions from the right people. We just need to get that one tip."" On Thursday, the FBI put out a poster of Arnold and added her to its ""kidnapping and missing persons"" website. It noted that she was wearing running clothes, mittens, earbuds and a grayish-blue iPod at the time of her disappearance. ""We are hopeful this will generate more tips in the case,"" Bertram said. ""Our goal is to keep her information and picture out in the public."" Frigid temperatures have heightened concerns. The low temperature Thursday night in Sidney was expected to dip to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, with daytime highs over the next two days forecast to be in the 30s, according to the National Weather Service. Gary Arnold said his wife's disappearance has been ""very difficult"" on the couple's children, though he said they are staying optimistic. ""Their mother has raised them well,"" he said. ""They are troupers, they are hanging in there, and they are not giving up hope either.""","Sherry Arnold, 43, went for a run on Saturday and hasn't been seen since .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The IRS says it's still trying to reach some 5 million Americans -- primarily seniors and veterans -- who have not filed the tax returns needed to qualify for their stimulus checks. The IRS is trying to reach people who do not normally file tax returns so they can apply for stimulus checks. ""This hasn't been the easiest undertaking for the IRS,"" Commissioner Doug Shulman told the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight on Thursday. Shulman explained that the IRS had sent out information packages to 20.5 million recipients of Social Security or veterans benefits who did not file 2006 tax returns to explain how to claim their payments. Around 15 million responded. The commissioner says the agency will soon send a second notice to the remaining 5.2 million and launch an aggressive public relations campaign titled, ""It's Not Too Late to File!"" In all, the IRS has sent out more than 76 million stimulus checks, in amounts up to $600 for individuals, $1,200 for married couples and $300 per child for families. The checks mailed nationwide so far total $63.8 billion, Shulman said. He predicted the total by the end of the calendar year would reach $100 billion. IRS phone banks have been inundated with questions about the stimulus payments, which began going out in April. The commissioner said the IRS received 72 million calls in May this year, compared with 19 million in May 2007. ""The numbers are staggering,"" he said. Shulman apologized for the now 13-minute average wait time to get an IRS employee on the phone, saying, ""It's where we'd not like to be, but it's a fact of doing stimulus."" Nina Olson, the IRS' national taxpayer advocate, said only a few glitches had developed in the stimulus effort. One occurred when the Social Security numbers of approximately 1,500 taxpayers were inadvertently disclosed when the IRS routed the stimulus payments to the wrong bank accounts. Olson also blamed the lack of participation of more than 5 million seniors and veterans on their lack of access to and experience with computers and the Internet, as well as a belief by some that the filing process is too cumbersome and complicated. ""I think there are some natural barriers to getting some folks to want to file a return again,"" she explained. To receive a stimulus check, people had to file a 2007 return. The notices sent to those who didn't file an income tax return in 2006 told them they should file a 1040A tax form for 2007 even if they had no tax liability.","5 million people, mostly seniors and vets, haven't filed papers for stimulus check .

"(CNN) -- Amid the rumblings of war between Russia and Ukraine, just how do you go about your everyday life? With foreboding and fear, according to former Ukraine football international Oleg Luzhny. ""Everyone is scared about war -- they are very nervous,"" Luzhny, who enjoyed a successful spell in the English Premier League with Arsenal, told CNN. More than once during our interview, Luzhny seemed desperate to deliver this message: ""It is important the whole world supports us."" He was speaking from his mother's home in Kiev, Ukraine, on Monday, after flying there from London, where he lives with his wife and children. He wanted to visit following the events of the past few weeks. Luzhny, who was born in in the western city of Lviv, last held a managerial job with Tavriya Simferopol -- a club based in Crimea, an autonomous region of eastern Ukraine with strong loyalty to Russia. ""Here in Kiev, it's OK but in Crimea and places like Donetsk and elsewhere, people are worried. Where there is a large population of Russians, they are scared,"" he said. ""Everyone is scared about war. They are very nervous. It's scary for the children, for the adults, for everyone. ""I hope the world can see what is going on and will speak out."" What he has witnessed on his television screen, and heard while speaking to his friends, has ignited a passion for his country's right to self-determination. Ukraine has been in chaos since President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted on February 22 following bloody street protests which left many dead and hundreds injured. A deepening split within Ukraine society has seen those in the western part of the country supporting the interim government and ties with the European Union, while those in the east advocate a Russian presence in Ukraine. Crimea, where Russia has sent more troops, remains firmly opposed to the new political leadership in Kiev. Ukraine suspects Russia of fomenting tension in the autonomous region and fears it might escalate into a bid for separation by its Russian majority population. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the country's interim prime minister, accused Moscow of declaring war and insisted his West-leaning government would not give up the Crimean region. But as words are traded by politicians around tables and via television screens, among the people, trepidation over Ukraine's future only grows. ""Russia is aggressive against many countries not just Ukraine,"" said Luzhny, who admitted he did not understand Russian President Vladimir Putin's tactics. ""They went into Georgia in 2008 and now they have gone into Ukraine,"" added Luzhny, referring to the five-day conflict between Georgia and Russia. ""I don't understand what he is doing or what he wants to gain from doing this. ""Nobody understands why he is doing this, for what? ""He says that it's to defend Russian people, but the Russian people in Ukraine that I know are saying, 'We are OK' -- they don't need any help."" Moscow has defended its parliament's approval to use military force to protect its citizens in the Crimean Peninsula. In the U.S., a senior White House official told CNN on Sunday that Russian forces ""have complete operational control of the Crimean Peninsula."" The official said the U.S. estimates there are 6,000 Russian ground and naval forces in the region. ""There is no question that they are in an occupation position -- flying in reinforcements and settling in,"" another senior administration official said. The move by Russia has been met with fear and anger in Ukraine while it has also been condemned by world leaders. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged the Russian Federation to ""refrain from any acts and rhetoric that can further escalate the situation and instead engage constructively and through peaceful means with Ukraine."" Luzhny, who was part of the famous Dynamo Kiev team of the 1990s which included Andrei Shevchenko and Sergei Rebrov, says he enjoyed his time working in Crimea before leaving in June last year. He still has friends in the region and while they are all OK, he says that the rise in tensions within Ukraine is unimaginable. ""When I was growing up I never thought this would happen. Nobody would have thought this situation would happen,"" he said. ""Everybody is surprised because nobody thought for a second that Putin would go into Ukraine. ""Everyone is shocked. Ask anybody if they expected this to happen and they would have said you were crazy and that it would be impossible."" In Kiev, Luzhny says life is returning to normal following the protests which raged for several days. He is at a loss to understand the decision to move Ukraine's international friendly game with the United States to Cyprus on March 5. It was originally scheduled for the eastern city of Kharkiv, but Luzhny believes it could still have been played on home soil -- even though the domestic championship has been suspended. ""There is no more trouble in Kiev, it is absolutely fine,"" he said. That cannot be said for Crimea and Donetsk, where tension continues to rise as the world waits to see how this situation plays out. ""I don't know what is going to happen next,"" said Luzhny. ""I think we will see something happen in the next few days because the whole world is watching Putin. ""It is so important that the world sees what is going on. ""We need their support,"" adds Luzhny in one last plaintive refrain.","Oleg Luzhny played international football for Ukraine .

"(Wired.com) -- A new piece of malware has caused an uptick in Apple customers reporting infected machines, renewing a timeless debate on the state of Macintosh security versus Windows. The trojan horse is called Mac Defender. It's a web pop-up containing a spoof message that tells customers their machines are infected by a virus and they must install anti-virus software. If customers agree to install the software, the program sporadically loads porn websites on their computer. ZDNet writer Ed Bott was first to spot a long thread of complaints in Apple's support forums related to Mac Defender, with at least 200 posts of customers reporting they've been infected by the malware. ""I've done similar searches in the past ... [and] I have never found more than one or two in-the-wild reports,"" Bott wrote. ""This time, the volume is truly exceptional."" Furthering his case, Bott in a follow-up article quoted an AppleCare technician who claims that phone calls to AppleCare support have grown four to five times recently, and the majority of the calls are related to Mac Defender. Customers and technology observers have debated for years whether the Mac is truly more secure than a Windows PC. The general consensus among security researchers is that there's nothing about the Mac that makes it inherently more secure than Windows -- indeed, the Mac platform has been easily penetrated in the Pwn2Own hacking contest in years past. But Windows has always been a juicier target for malicious hackers because it has much larger market share than the Mac. As a result, when customers switch from a Windows to a Mac, they're often under the impression that they're switching to a more secure, sterile environment where they won't need to install expensive, resource-hogging anti-virus software. While it's not true that the Mac is more secure, theplatform is generally ""safer"" because fewer people target it, security researchers have told Wired.com in the past. Bott's discovery renews this debate: A new piece of malware seems to be fooling more Mac customers than past examples. So does this change the scenario? Should Mac customers install anti-virus software by default like most Windows customers do? Charlie Miller, a security researcher who has repeatedly won the annual Pwn2Own hacking contest by hacking Macs and iPhones, told Wired.com he doesn't think so. Miller noted that Microsoft recently pointed out that 1 in 14 downloads on Windows are malicious. And the fact that there is just one piece of Mac malware being widely discussed illustrates how rare malware still is on the Mac platform, he said. And while 200 posts complaining about Mac Defender in Apple's support forums may seem like a lot, that's still a small fraction of the millions of Mac customers in the world. While Mac Defender does show that the problem is getting worse and people should be more wary about malware, it doesn't necessarily mean that every Mac user today should rush to buy anti-virus software, Miller said. Ultimately, it's up to the customer because there's a trade-off involved. Anti-virus software will help protect your system from being infected, but it's expensive, uses system memory and reduces battery life. ""Mac malware is still relatively rare, but is getting worse,"" Miller said. ""At some point soon, the scales will tip to installing antivirus, but at this point, I don't think it's worth it yet for most people."" In looking into the effects of Mac Defender, Wired.com's sister publication Ars Technica did a thorough investigation on the state of Mac malware, speaking with 14 Mac support specialists. ""The truth is hard to tease out,"" ArsTechnica's Jacqui Cheng wrote. ""Partly because Mac OS X still makes up a comparatively small percentage of the global OS market share, and partly because Apple itself is a secretive company, it's not easy to find out whether malware on the Mac is indeed becoming more common, or it's simply being reported on more often."" The results were all over the map, with most certified Mac support specialists logging a low number of malware reports. But some Apple Genius Bar technicians noticed an uptick in malware instances, thanks to Mac Defender. Though the conclusion is unclear, the moral of this story is to be wary that Mac malware is in the wild, and be cautious about installing sketchy software from unfamiliar sources. Mac Defender may be the first wake-up call for people who believed that Macs don't get viruses. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN)  -- It's 7:20 a.m. and Carl Daikeler hasn't worked out yet. Not a big deal for the 49% of Americans who don't exercise regularly, but it's going to bother him all day. The problem is the CEO of Beachbody, the company behind P90X and Insanity, doesn't like to work out. So much so that he sometimes has to ""trick"" himself into the gym. Like the time he decided he couldn't brush his teeth before he worked out for at least 10 minutes. That little ploy inspired Beachbody's 10-Minute Trainer program. The fitness industry is constantly coming up with similar tricks to get more of us off the couch, Daikeler said. The result is a rotation of incoming and outgoing trends -- from Jane Fonda's VHS tapes in the early '80s to Beachbody's DVD programs that are popular today. Daikeler compares fitness to fashion. ""Somebody starts wearing a certain shoe in Milan or Japan and suddenly everybody wants to wear it,"" he said. ""It doesn't just solve the problem -- like shoes cover your feet. It makes you feel like it's (a part of) your identity."" Starla Kay teaches youth video classes at the Indiana Black Expo in Indianapolis. She has a 19-month-old son and not a lot of time for a workout program that doesn't work. She tried kickboxing, aerobics and just going to the gym, but nothing really stuck until she got one of this year's hot trends, P90X. ""This is the first actual program I've done,"" she said. ""I feel stronger. I feel like I have more energy. I've lost 9 pounds so far."" The American College of Sports Medicine publishes a yearly survey of the top worldwide fitness trends. The top 10 list for 2011 includes boot camps and programs aimed at older adults. Trends depend on many factors, said the survey's lead author, Walt Thompson. Take Pilates, which dropped off the survey's list from No. 9 last year. Thompson believes the economy made Pilates equipment and specialized instructors too expensive for clubs to maintain. He's not sure if Pilates will make a return to the top 20, but he doesn't expect a few of this year's trends to stick around long. ""The problem with the high-intensity kind of programs is that they deliver a punch like severe weight loss programs do, but they're difficult to comply with in the long haul,"" he said. Remember the slide board? Tae Bo? Step aerobics? All trends Houston, Texas, YMCA senior program director Karen Behrend has seen come and go in her 28 years of teaching group fitness. ""The reason why programs like that don't stick is because they're too hard to do,"" she said. ""The things that really stick are programs that cross over multiple (ability) levels."" Kay said when she first attempted the P90X DVD program it was ""too much"" so she dropped it after two weeks. But when she started attending a class with an instructor who taught her how to modify the moves, she found herself returning six days a week at 7 a.m. Behrend cites classes like Zumba, body pump and spinning as success stories. They're consistent, easy to follow and include that always important element of fun. ""They make people feel successful,"" IDEA Fitness Journal Editor-in-chief Sandy Todd Webster said. ""That's a huge key in good programming is to make people feel like 'Wow, I get it.' "" IDEA is the world's largest association for fitness and wellness professionals. It also does a yearly survey of fitness trends. This year, aerobics, water fitness and martial arts-based classes had the largest decline in popularity. Dance and boot camp classes showed the largest growth. ""Think Jazzercise classes -- they're fun. They combine good music, easy choreography (and) social aspects,"" Webster said. Jazzercise is one of those trends that stuck. Judi Sheppard Missett founded the company in 1969 and the dance-based classes are still popular across the world. In fact, Entrepreneur Magazine recently named Jazzercise 2011's most successful fitness franchise. ""It's not like you can take a six-week course and be fit the rest of your life,"" Missett said. ""It's really good that people are coming up with different ways to move. I'm happy for anybody doing anything, anything that gets them off the couch and on their feet."" She continues to choreograph routines to approximately 30 new songs every 10 weeks to keep her high member retention rate. It is the beauty and curse of the industry, Behrend said. Old trends evolve into new ones, forcing gyms to stay cutting edge, but keeping customers excited about working out. ""The trick only lasts so long,"" Daikeler said, going back to his fashion analogy. ""The best designers aren't looking for trends; the best designers set the trends. Will this capture a market audience or is this like Lady Gaga's meat dress?"" Daikeler said he just hopes whatever the industry comes up with next is the end of the biggest trend in America right now: obesity.","Fitness industry constantly coming up with tricks to get more of us off the couch .

"(CNN)  -- The Dominican Republic was the first country to give aid to Haiti in the aftermath of Tuesday's devastating earthquake. Some of the first video images of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince came from a Dominican television crew. On the face of it, the quick reaction from Haiti's neighbor may not seem surprising given their proximity. But historically, a much wider gap in relations has existed between Haiti and the Dominican Republic since colonial times. The Dominican Republic's outpouring of support to Haiti is a reminder of how the less-than-friendly legacy between the two nations has been buried even deeper. Some tensions still exist between citizens of both countries. Dominicans recall how they were under Haitian rule for a period in the mid-1800s, and how they repeatedly fought Haitian aggressions. Today, Haitians provide cheap labor in the Dominican Republic, a trend that has caused resentment on both sides, not unlike the illegal immigration debate in the United States. But as far as the countries themselves are officially concerned, ""relations are at a high point compared to 20 or 30 years ago,"" Ernesto Sagas, associate professor of ethnic studies at Colorado State University, told CNN. ""Relations between the countries at the presidential level are at high levels."" Dominican Public Works Minister Victor Diaz Rua surveyed the damage in Port-au-Prince Wednesday as his country planned the necessary logistics to provide international aid. Are you there? Submit an iReport . ""The center of the city, where the presidential palace collapsed, is practically completely destroyed,"" Diaz Rua told CNN en Español, noting he saw hotels, schools and hospitals that were damaged. Impact Your World: How you can help . Diaz Rua also saw few emergency teams working. ""We're going to send teams from the Dominican Republic to help with the rescue. We're going to send food, water and mobile clinics,"" he said. Such cooperation was not historically the case. Haiti, a former French colony, and the Dominican Republic, with roots as a Spanish colony, have tensions that go back to those days, Sagas said. The Dominican Republic gained its independence from Haiti in 1844, after Haiti had occupied it. The Dominicans spent the next 20 years fighting off Haitian invasion attempts. By the early 20th century, Haitians had become a source of cheap labor in the neighboring country. Racism and security concerns resulted in a massacre in 1937. Dominican leader Rafael Trujillo ordered the execution of Haitians living near the border between the countries, resulting in the killings of 20,000 to 30,000 Haitians, historians say. The current tragedy appears to push those tensions further into the past. ""This is the worst disaster in Haiti's recorded history,"" Sagas said. ""The best role the DR can play is to open its border for other nations to funnel all the aid to Haiti."" The Dominican Republic appears to be following that path. The government on Wednesday started sending food, medicine and rescue crews to Haiti, the El Nacional newspaper reported. Top Dominican leaders amassed at the border as a staging ground to begin transporting aid into the country. Are you looking for loved ones? Among the aid are 10 mobile cafeterias that can produce 100,000 meals a day, and heavy equipment to remove debris, Diaz Rua said.","Dominican Republic first nation to give aid to Haiti post-quake .

"(CNN) -- Throughout his career as a television anchorman, Walter Cronkite had a few memorable run-ins with other powerful figures at CBS News, one of his producers told CNN. Walter Cronkite occasionally butted heads with executives at CBS News, his former producer says. Sanford ""Sandy"" Socolow, who worked at CBS News for 32 years, more than four of them as Cronkite's producer, said Cronkite ran into trouble soon after he took over for Douglas Edwards in the ""CBS Evening News"" anchor chair. ""The first night up, he ended the show by saying, I'm paraphrasing, 'That's the news. Be sure to check your local newspapers tomorrow to get all the details on the headlines we are delivering to you.'"" That didn't fly. ""The suits -- as we used to call them -- went crazy,"" Socolow told CNN, referring to CBS executives. ""From their perspective, Cronkite was sending people to read newspapers instead of watching the news. There was a storm."" CBS News President Richard Salant met with Cronkite, who initially resisted, then agreed to change his sign-off, Socolow said.  Watch friends and admirers weigh in on the death of a giant » . ""In the absence of anything else, he came up with 'That's the way it is.'"" But that too ruffled feathers, Socolow said. ""Salant's attitude was, 'We're not telling them that's the way it is. We can't do that in 15 minutes,' which was the length of the show in those days. 'That's not the way it is.'"" Still, Cronkite persisted and that's the way it was from then on.  Watch what happened the one time Cronkite failed to say it » . In 1960, in an attempt to emulate the success of NBC's ""Huntley-Brinkley Report,"" CBS tried to make Cronkite and fellow broadcast legend Edward R. Murrow co-anchors at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. But ""it just didn't work out,"" said Socolow, who was then producing for Cronkite. ""There wasn't a particular chemistry there."" Though the two men were cordial, and it was Murrow who had brought Cronkite to CBS, ""they were never drinking buddies,"" Socolow said. In 1968, Cronkite returned from a visit to Vietnam disillusioned with America's role there. He told Salant what he thought but said he did not want to report his personal opinion on air, Socolow said. Only ""after much haggling"" did he agree to do so, and not on the regular newscast but on a 10 p.m. special. ""To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past,"" Cronkite told his audience. ""To suggest we are on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. To say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory conclusion. ... It is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could."" Cronkite's reluctance to reveal his personal opinions about world events during a newscast was matched by his enthusiasm for keeping newscasts free of the influence of commercial interests.  Watch the Cronkite Journalism School dean reflect on his legacy » . ""He was a purist,"" Socolow said. ""And, a lot of people would say, to a fault, if there can be a fault in such a definition."" For example, he said, around the time of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, in which a nuclear plant's core partially melted, the movie ""China Syndrome"" was released with a similar theme. ""I was so knocked out to its proximity to the events of the day, I arranged a screening for the entire staff of the 'Evening News,'"" Socolow said. Though Cronkite did not attend, ""the next day, I go into him and say, 'You know this is really uncanny that this movie should be so close to the bone, and it's just stunning, a stunning coincidence, and I think we could make a story out of it.' ""He shouted at me, 'I'm not in the goddamn business of selling movie tickets.'"" Cronkite even disliked promoting pieces that were slated to run in the next day's newscast, Socolow said. ""His attitude being, 'For God's sake, we don't know what tomorrow's news is going to be. How the hell can we take time away from reporting today's news by promoting a story for tomorrow?'""  Watch why Cronkite was ""the most important man"" » . Cronkite departed from the anchor chair voluntarily, Socolow said. ""He wanted to retire as undefeated champ, and he made his views known."" But Salant, who was also planning to retire shortly, did not want to be the guy who oversaw Cronkite's exit. ""His ratings on the day he left the 'Evening News' were bigger than all three network newscasts together today,"" Socolow said. ""He had an average rating of 27 million to 29 million viewers.""  View images from Cronkite's career » . Salant pleaded with Cronkite to stay so that the decision on how to replace him would fall to someone else. That someone else was Bill Leonard. ""On the first day Leonard was in the saddle, Cronkite said, 'Listen, I want to go out as undefeated champion,'"" Socolow said. At the same time, then-correspondent Dan Rather's contract was ending and he was being courted by ABC News, Socolow said. ""The idea of losing Cronkite was enough to make people gag,"" he said. ""On the other hand, there was the chance they'd lose Rather. What finally happened is Leonard took the opportunity to sign Rather to a contract that was so rich to keep him out of [ABC executive] Roone Arledge's hands that it had to go up to [CBS founder and Chairman] Bill Paley to get an OK on the contract."" But Cronkite's departure did not go as he had planned, according to his producer. ""The script on his last night said something like, unlike old soldiers who never die, he'll be back every once in a while on an irregular basis when something strikes his fancy -- a handshake deal he had with Bill Leonard,"" Socolow said. ""A very loose deal."" But Leonard left the top job soon after, replaced by Van Gordon Sauter, who -- ""in cahoots, I think you would have to say, with Dan Rather -- decided they did not want Cronkite on the air, for whatever reason."" After he left the anchor chair, Cronkite worked on occasional science and environment pieces on television, but after a few years he rarely appeared on CBS.","Legendary anchorman butted heads with CBS executives, producer says .

"(CNN) -- A report by the Massachusetts inspector general released Tuesday said that former drug lab technician Annie Dookhan was the ""sole bad actor"" at a Boston drug lab once responsible for tests related to thousands of criminal cases, and that directors of the facility were ""ill-suited"" to oversee her and other lab technicians. The state of Massachusetts says Dookhan doctored evidence to change test results at the Hinton State Drug Laboratory. After Dookhan's co-workers told state police her work might be unreliable, the state attorney general's office began investigating the case in July 2012. The tampering called into question at least 40,000 cases going back to 2003 and, in some cases, may have wrongfully convicted the innocent. She was found guilty of multiple charges related to the case, including obstruction of justice, mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. She was sentenced in November of last year to three to five years in prison. ""Dookhan was the sole bad actor at the Drug Lab. Though many of the chemists worked alongside Dookhan for years, the OIG (Office of the Inspector General) found no evidence that any other chemist at the Drug Lab committed any malfeasance with respect to testing evidence or knowingly aided Dookhan in committing her malfeasance,"" the report said. But the report didn't stop short of blaming the unprecedented breach in confidence solely on Dookhan. ""The directors were ill-suited to oversee a forensic drug lab, provided almost no supervision, were habitually unresponsive to chemists' complaints and suspicions, and severely downplayed Dookhan's major breach in chain-of-custody protocol upon discovering it,"" according to the inspector general's report. The Inspector General's Office reviewed more than 200,000 documents -- including e-mails, lab results and lab records -- and interviewed more than 40 people who worked with the drug lab to check for deficiencies, the report said. An investigation by Inspector General Glenn Cunha and his office showed that former Department of Public Health Commissioner ""John Auerbach and his staff failed to respond appropriately to the report of Dookhan's breach of protocol"" and ""the investigation DPH conducted was far too narrow,"" the report said. Gov. Deval Patrick closed the lab, in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood, in August 2012. That year, Auerbach submitted his letter of resignation from the Public Health Department to Patrick amid the investigation, and the Massachusetts State Police now oversee all of the state's drug cases. The Inspector General's Office concluded that ""all samples in which Dookhan was the primary chemist should be treated as suspect and be subject to careful review."" In addition to the drug samples Dookhan mishandled, an additional 2,000 drug samples not handled by Dookhan were found to potentially contain ""exculpatory evidence"" to defendants in criminal cases because the drug lab failed to disclose ""additional, inconsistent testing results,"" the report said. The Inspector General's Office says it is retesting these samples and will give prosecutors and defendants accurate information about the tests when they're completed. In November 2012, Donta Hood, who was convicted of a cocaine charge in 2009, was released from prison after his defense team questioned the validity of Dookhan's testing results and her expert testimony. After his release, he was arrested on a gun possession charge. While on bail for that charge, he was arrested and charged with the murder of Charles Evans, 45, the Brockton Police Department said. Hood is awaiting trial on the murder charge. The next hearing in this case is a motions hearing on March 11, the Brockton Superior Court Criminal Clerk's Office said.","The drug lab was once responsible for tests related to thousands of criminal cases .

"(CNN) -- Raymond Felton: New York Knicks point guard, charged with criminal weapons possession over a high-powered semiautomatic handgun. Aaron Hernandez: New England Patriots tight end, awaiting trial on first-degree murder in the execution-style killing of Odin Lloyd. Plaxico Burress: New York Giant star receiver, imprisoned after pleading guilty on weapons charges for having a gun inside a Manhattan nightclub. These three are among the examples of high-quality, high-profile professional players accused of crossing a line -- in these cases while using firearms. Every week, in fact, it seems there's another athlete accused of some heinous crime. Are sports stars more prone to dangerous, criminal behavior -- including those involving guns -- than your everyday Joe? Will they more likely carry guns and use them? And are more and more of them breaking the law and spiraling out of control? ""Statistically, absolutely not,"" said Mitch Abrams, a sport psychologist and clinical assistant professor at Rutgers' Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. ""But nobody gives a hoot. ... These athletes are more celebrities than anything else."" Sports stars have been hailed for decades in American society, and with that comes extra attention and scrutiny. Still, in today's 24-hour news cycle -- in a media world with the NFL and NHL and NBA and MLB networks, not to mention the ESPNs of the world -- that spotlight has gotten brighter. And when someone such as Ray Rice of the Baltimore Ravens is accused of knocking his wife unconscious or former NFL standout turned analyst Darren Sharper is charged in multiple date rapes, people take notice because: 1) their alleged crimes are egregious, and 2) they are known to millions of Americans. That celebrity aspect is critical when you're trying to put such stories into perspective, according to Dan Lebowitz, the executive director for the Sports in Society center at Boston's Northeastern University. Because ""celebrity culture drives the news cycle"" and because star athletes are celebrities, he says, these kinds of stories are read and spread everywhere. Yet even if it might seem that way, it doesn't change the fact that -- when compared with crime rates for all adult males -- professional athletes are no more likely to kill someone, get arrested for a gun crime or be convicted of domestic violence. ""It's upsetting, and it stands out,"" Lebowitz says of news about alleged killings, rapes, abuse and other horrific acts involving athletes. ""But that doesn't mean it's (endemic)."" There have been examples in which that ubiquitous celebrity seemingly has come at a steep price. Take Sean Taylor, a Washington Redskins star defender shot dead inside his Florida home during what appeared to be a botched burglary. There's also Washington Nationals' catcher Wilson Ramos, who was kidnapped in Venezuela. And it's not just players who are targeted, as seen in the kidnapping of the mother of iconic Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. For that reason, Abrams says, many athletes legitimately ""fear that they are going to be in danger."" ""The problem is, they don't know what they're doing with their guns."" Burress could be exhibit No. 1: He inadvertently shot himself, having never threatened anyone else. Gilbert Arenas, then a standout with the Washington Wizards, was charged with a felony gun violation after drawing guns in the locker room -- something he insisted was a joke. Lebowitz said such cases reflect more on America's ""gun culture"" than its sports culture. While Department of Justice statistics show the number of purposeful and accidental shootings have fallen in recent decades, ""There is (still) an inordinate amount of kids being killed on a daily basis."" Yes, Abrams admits, sometimes an intense, hypermasculine pro athlete who acts like a warrior on the field has a fragile ego off it, unsure what to do when someone (particularly a woman) challenges him. ""He feels insecure, he feels hurt,"" said Abrams, the author of ""Anger Management in Sport."" ""As things escalate, maybe it becomes physical."" This isn't the norm, though. Most past and present athletes carry themselves well or at least don't commit crimes. When some of them do go down the wrong path, that's more a function of the fact they are human, not that they are athletes. Lebowitz calls ""sports ... the ultimate common denominator,"" because any given roster can represent society as a whole -- all colors, races, classes and creeds. Some of these athletes commit crimes, just like some nonathletes do. As Abrams says, ""Sports are a microcosm of society. And we live in a violent society.""","The NBA's Raymond Felton is the latest pro athlete to face charges related to guns .

"Cairo (CNN) -- U.S. Sens. John McCain and John Kerry focused on the U.S. and Egyptian economies during a trip to Egypt Saturday and Sunday. Their stop in Cairo was part of a broader trip to promote U.S. economic ties in the region. ""As America continues to struggle with its economic recovery, we face no more urgent priority than to expand our trade and investment in the world,"" McCain said in a Sunday statement. But he warned that the success or failure of Egypt's revolution will depend on the health of the Egyptian economy. In an effort to spur U.S. investment in Egypt, Kerry and McCain led a delegation of American businessmen representing companies including General Electric, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Dow, Marriott International and Exxon Mobil. Early Sunday morning, McCain and Kerry rang the opening bell at the Egyptian Stock Exchange in Cairo. Later in the day, the two traveled to a Coca-Cola plant within the city that supplies 46 countries with Coke products. McCain reiterated, in a speech at the plant, America's willingness to provide Egypt with political and financial assistance during the country's transitional phase. ""The American people, on a non-partisan basis, want to see this revolution succeed,"" McCain said. ""The American people will live in a more secure world if this revolution succeeds."" In his remarks at the plant, Kerry mentioned a new ""enterprise fund"" that would provide ""several hundreds of millions of dollars"" to help Egyptian small businesses. Billions of dollars are needed to revive Egypt's economy, Kerry said, but the United States is willing, along with other countries, to provide assistance. This is McCain's third trip to Egypt since the January 25 revolution that drove former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from power. Kerry has also visited Egypt twice since Mubarak resigned February 11. Their visit also included meetings with high-ranking Egyptian officials, including the head of Egypt's interim government, Field Marshal Mohamed Tantawi, who leads the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. The two also met with Egypt's prime minister and minister of finance. McCain reiterated the United States' desire to allow international monitors to observe Egypt's upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections, which are scheduled for later this fall. After meeting with Tantawi, both senators expressed confidence that the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces would hand over power to a civilian government after the election. ""This election is an election that the world can see that there was accountability and there was transparency and that indeed the voice of the people of Egypt was heard,"" said Kerry.","A stop in Cairo is part of a broader trip to promote U.S. economic ties .

"Paris (CNN) -- French presidential frontrunner Francois Hollande vowed Friday to crack down on illegal immigration, as he and incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy battle to win over the public ahead of a second-round vote. Hollande, of the center-left Socialist party, will hold a rally in the central city of Limoges Friday evening, while Sarkozy addresses supporters in Dijon, to the east. The pair face a run-off vote for the presidency on May 6. Sarkozy received 27.2% of the vote in the first round of voting last Sunday, just behind Hollande's 28.6%. Speaking to French radio station RTL Friday morning, Hollande said that the number of legal economic migrants should be limited and that he wants to ""fight against"" illegal immigration. Immigration has been a key election issue, alongside the struggling economy and high unemployment figures. Hollande's comments came hours after the two rivals were quizzed on television channel France 2 Thursday night, taking turns to answer journalists' questions. Hollande, who was first to be put on the spot, said he feels ""confident"" and the political left's results had been even better than hoped for. ""Nothing is decided until the people have spoken. I have three duties: to put things right in France, to apply justice where it has been missing, and to bring together the French around a great cause -- the young people."" Sarkozy, who leads the center-right UMP party, defended his record, saying: ""I have been president for five years. I've tried to protect France with all my might."" He said predictions of a landslide for the left in the first round had not been borne out, with the far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen coming third, well ahead of far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Since Sunday, both Sarkozy and Hollande have sought to reach out to the 6.5 million people who voted for the National Front, giving it 18% of the vote. ""They are not from the extreme right, they are expressing themselves through a vote of crisis or of loyalty,"" Sarkozy said on France 2. ""I would like to say to them that I respect them. When someone suffers or protests, we must listen to them in order to be able to provide them with responses."" However, Sarkozy rejected any notion of striking a deal with the far-right group in remarks Wednesday. The National Front's tough line on immigration appears to have struck a chord with many voters. Responding to a question on Thursday's TV show, Hollande said, ""There are too many foreigners"" in France. ""But that does not mean that we must expel those who are here on our territory."" Hollande, who has previously avoided that question, said those who are in France legally would be able to remain -- but those who do not have the right to live there would be driven out. Sarkozy said he wanted to cut by half the number of foreigners allowed into the country over the next five years. The reason, he said, is that he wants to welcome them in the right way, ""with housing and employment, and that from now on, before all entries onto French national soil ... an exam on the French language and republican values should be passed."" Immigrants should have rights and responsibilities equal to those born in France, he said, even if he is opposed to extending them the right to vote. Hollande also addressed France's position in Europe, saying Germany would have to negotiate on a fiscal pact agreed by the eurozone in order to permit growth. ""It's not Germany who will decide everything for all of Europe,"" he said. ""We are not just any country in Europe. We are one of the leaders of Europe."" The two contenders will take part in their first head-to-head televised debate next Wednesday. If elected, Hollande would be France's first left-wing president since Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995. Sarkozy has been president since 2007. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","Election frontrunner Francois Hollande says he wants to combat illegal immigration .

"(CNN) -- It's been called the ""Sistine Chapel of paleolithic art,"" and it's been closed to the public for more than a decade -- until now. Yesterday, five members of the public who entered a draw were given a guided tour of the extraordinary prehistoric paintings within the Altamira cave in northern Spain. The vivid images, up to 20,000 years old, depict an extinct species of bison, wild boar and other animals, along with sprayed hand prints and engravings. The visit of a lucky few to the twisting, 300-meter-long cave -- sealed in pristine condition by a rockfall for 13,000 years before its discovery in 1879 -- serves a wider purpose beyond their own amazement, however. Small groups drawn from visitors to the nearby museum on one randomly selected day each week until August will be used to test any destructive impact a human presence might have on the ancient paintings through changes in humidity, temperature, CO2 levels and microbiological contamination, the Guardian reports. Wearing protective clothing, masks and shoes, the visitors get a tour of the cave lasting just over half an hour, only a portion of which is to be spent gazing at the rock art. The results will help to determine whether the cave, in the Cantabria region, should be reopened to the public permanently -- a boon to the local economy but an outcome opposed by some scientists. Dismissed as forgeries . Revealed in the late 19th century by an amateur archaeologist led to the site by his eight-year-old daughter, the charcoal and ochre animal studies and other figures at Altamira were at first dismissed as forgeries. The images, in some cases exploiting the cave's natural contours to create an even more lifelike effect, were deemed too sophisticated to have been produced by ancient humans. It was only 20 years later, when the Altamira paintings could be compared with other recent prehistoric finds, that their extreme antiquity was accepted -- and the understanding of early humans transformed. The Altamira cave was first closed to the public in 1977, when the body heat and CO2 from 3,000 daily visitors were found to be damaging the paintings. The site was subsequently reopened to restricted numbers, creating a waiting list of up to three years. In 2002, Altamira -- a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1985 -- was closed a second time when body heat, light and moisture were found to be causing a green mold to grow on the ancient works. Campaign to reopen cave . Since then the Cantabrian regional administration has pushed for Altamira to be opened to the public once more. The goal was to achieve a ""balance"" between preserving the rock art and making a vital part of Spain's heritage accessible, the director of the Altamira Museum, JosÃ© Antonio Lasheras, told CNN. However, the Spanish government's main research body opposes the reopening of the cave. ""The consequences of doing so are incalculable,"" Sergio SÃ¡nchez Moral, lead researcher at the Spanish National Research Council, told Publico.es. For the past decade, visitors to Altamira have had to be content with replicas of the paintings -- mainly those in the cave's main chamber -- located a short walk away in in the museum. ""The original [paintings] can be thrilling because the feeling of entering the cave is difficult to reproduce,"" Lasheras said. ""But people have also felt excited going through the replica."" The museum also has a permanent exhibition called ""The Times of Altamira,"" including furniture made of animal bone and antler, depicting life during the paleolithic era. Museo de Altamira, Avda.

"Rockville, Maryland (CNN) -- If you've been glued to the Winter Olympics, you might be feeling inspired to get out there and move. Maybe take up curling? Or hit the slopes? Well how about stepping onto an ice rink? Sure, teenagers dominated the figure skating podiums at the Sochi, Olympics, but here in the United States and around the world, a growing number of skaters lacing up to compete are well into their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. At 63, Rhea Schwartz skates almost everyday. ""Someone dared me to skate when I was 30,"" Schwartz said. ""And I fell in love with it."" After that first group lesson, Schwartz signed up for more classes, and then for semi-private lessons, and then for private lessons. But as the years went by, she felt something was missing. ""I realized there was no program for adult skating,"" she said. ""And there were more people who looked like me and not like kids."" Gold for Russia, silver for South Korea's Yuna Kim, and controversy ensues . Schwartz started lobbying the U.S. Figure Skating Association to recognize adult figure skaters in 1990. It took five years to get the governing body to come around. Schwartz was named chair of the first U.S Adult Figure Skating committee in 1995. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the U.S Adult Figure Skating Championships; 600 skaters are expected to compete, including 47-year-old Beth Delano. ""The plan is to qualify, compete, and hopefully win,"" said Delano, a three-time national champion. Delano started skating when she was 7, but stopped when she was 17 to focus on college. She returned to the ice when she was 27. ""I fell in love with it again,"" said Delano. ""Where else can I wear a pretty dress, skate to beautiful music, and be dripping in Swarovski crystals? This is what I want to do!"" Young skaters dream of Olympic gold, no matter the obstacles . This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the International Adult Figure Skating Competition, held each year in Oberstdorf, Germany. ""They come from all over the world, every continent, it is just amazing,"" said Schwartz, who now chairs the international competition. Schwartz expects that 500 skaters representing 35 countries will compete. Delano was 38 when she stepped onto the ice and first heard the words: ""Representing the United States of America."" ""That was really a dream come true,"" said Delano, who earned silver at the inaugural competition. ""You are never too old to skate,"" says Schwartz. Indeed, the oldest competitive adult skater at D.C.'s Washington Figure Skating Club is 75-year-old Barbara Murry. And Schwartz says one woman from Lake Placid, New York, is well loved by many adult skaters. ""(She's) well into her 80s now, who still skates at adult nationals, and is an inspiration,"" said Schwartz. ""You just keep doing it, because it's wonderful,"" said Schwartz. ""Not only is adult skating wonderful exercise, but it creates a fabulous community of friends all over the country, and all over the world.""","A growing number of figure skaters compete well into their 30s, 40s, and even 50s .
""I fell in love with it again,"" Beth Delano says of returning to skating after a decade-long break .

"(CNN) -- The distance between the Maidan in downtown Kiev, Ukraine, and the WhatsApp headquarters in downtown Mountain View, California, is 6,139 miles. This quite long distance, however, is bridged by another figure: the number 19. On February 19, after months of protests in Kiev's center spiraled out of control, a de facto state of emergency took effect in Ukraine, eventually leading to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych. In Silicon Valley, February 19 marked a turning point for WhatsApp founder Jan Koum, who signed a $19 billion deal to sell his company to Facebook. For Ukraine, that same $19 billion would be the answer to its short-term bond debt and gas bills. Though a mere coincidence, the fact that one country's economic lifeline could be equal in cost to the purchase of a mobile messaging app in another exemplifies that the real distance between the Maidan and Mountain View is not geographic. Before Jan Koum was a billionaire and long before he was a Silicon Valley technology executive, he was Ukrainian. Koum, born in a village outside of Kiev, emigrated from a politically unstable Ukraine as a teenager. At the turn of the 20th century, my very own Kiev-born great-grandfather made a similar choice. Disillusioned with authoritarianism, he became an anarchist at a time when anarchism was not a meme for punk rockers and skateboarders, but an actual political movement. He eventually made his way to Chicago, where he started a small business. There are others like my grandfather and Koum in Ukraine. I've seen first-hand the potential and technological savvy of the Ukrainian people. I was blown away by Enable Talk -- a project from four Ukrainian student developers who created gloves that translate sign language into speech. Enable Talk took home the first prize at the Microsoft Imagine Cup competition in 2012, and Time magazine named it one of the best inventions of the year. 'We were trapped': Eyewitness to the massacre in Kiev . According to the Central and Eastern European Outsourcing Association, Ukraine is the No. 1 outsourcing destination in the region for information-technology services. Tech companies in Silicon Valley, London and Berlin are teeming with Ukrainian engineers -- Ukraine's hackers-for-hire are some of the best in the world. But such burgeoning innovators, held back by dysfunctional governance in their country, have not been able to enjoy the kind of success that WhatsApp is realizing today. At the very moment Koum and Mark Zuckerberg were finalizing their deal, female entrepreneurs in Ukraine were preparing for an event called Startup Weekend Kyiv, meant to take place in the capital last weekend. The group's website now reads: ""Due to political turmoil this event has been postponed."" Mired in corruption, kleptocracy and authoritarianism, Ukraine has not nurtured the Koums of its future. A long history of scientific and technological excellence shows that Ukraine-born talent usually realizes its full potential after leaving Ukraine's political environment behind. Nearly 100 years ago, Kiev-born Igor Sikorsky immigrated to the United States following the Bolshevik Revolution. He founded the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, where he built the first successful helicopter. Seventy years later, Max Levchin's family, also hailing from Kiev, sought political asylum in Chicago. In 1998, Levchin founded a company we all know well -- PayPal. In Ukraine, the hope is that the days of fleeing political turmoil are coming to an end and that the possibility of new leadership will be a move toward a more functional democracy, less corruption, and more realized potential. But whatever early promise there is in Kiev can quickly be lost if unrest in Crimea spreads. There will be a new wave of emigration out of the Crimea region if it becomes the staging ground of a proxy conflict between Russia and the West. Whatever happens, for Americans, Koum's Ukrainian roots should also serve as a reminder that we live in a nation of immigrants, that a continual wave of immigration is what fuels our economy. When Koum and his mother immigrated to Mountain View in 1992, they subsisted on food stamps and welfare. Koum barely graduated from high school and dropped out of college. He taught himself computer networking from used book store manuals and created WhatsApp in 2009. In 20 years, Koum went from food stamps to billionaire, epitomizing the American dream, yet he is exactly the type of immigrant that opponents of immigration reform say they do not want in America. As our nation continues to tackle the important issue of immigration reform, we need to remember that successful companies are not always founded by the immigrants with a master's degree in hand. Symbolically, Koum signed his $19 billion deal last week at the site where he once stood in line to collect food stamps. Like WhatsApp, 40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. In March 2013, Koum tweeted about his adoptive homeland: ""WhatsApp Messenger: Made in USA. Land of the free and the home of the brave."" Ukraine's new leaders would do well to recognize that it can be home to multibillion-dollar breakouts if it creates a functional environment for its innovators. America would do well to remember that it needs to welcome more families like the Koums if it is going to remain the global center of innovation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alec Ross.","Alec Ross notes that price paid to Ukraine-born Jan Koum equals Ukraine's past due bills .
He says there's long tradition of entrepreneurial success for Ukraine emigres to U.S.

"(CNN) -- Bordered by Thailand, Indonesia and Brunei, and with a heritage of diverse influences including a long period of British colonial rule and an economically powerful Chinese community, Malaysia is one of the most multicultural nations in southeast Asia. Comprised of two regions separated by 640 miles of the South China Sea, with Peninsular Malaysia to the west and Malaysian Borneo to the east, the country is a federation of 13 states that is home to an estimated population of 25.7 million people. From the 18th until to the 20th century, the region formed part of what was loosely known as British Malay -- a divided collection of colonized states. By 1948, these British-ruled territories were bought together under a single administration called the Federation of Malaya, which gained independence in 1957. Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore and the states of Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of neighboring Borneo also joined. The country's infancy was dogged by Communist insurgency, Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia over claims to the island of Borneo, Philippine claims to Sabah, and Singapore's secession from the Federation in 1965. With a strictly neutral attitude towards foreign affairs, Malaysia has since enjoyed a sustained period of relatively untroubled international relations. However, the multi-religious, multi-ethnic nation has still had to contend with its own internal tensions. Ethnic Malays make up 50 percent of the population, Chinese a further 23 percent, with Indians and indigenous peoples forming the remainder, according to the CIA World Factbook. In 1969 anti-Chinese riots took place amidst growing frustration over the economic success of ethnic Chinese in Malaysia. This led to a controversial policy of positive discrimination, which saw minimum quotas introduced for Malays in business, education and the civil service. During the 22-year term of Prime Minister Mathathir bin Mohamad -- between 1981 and 2003 -- the country diversified from dependence on exports of raw materials such as palm oil, tin, petroleum and gas, to expansion in manufacturing, services, and tourism. Today the bustling capital of Kuala Lumpur, a former tin-mining town, is dominated by gleaming skyscrapers. Among them are the tallest twin buildings in the world -- the Petronas Twin Towers -- a potent symbol of Malaysia's development. Although the country's export trade was hit hard by the loss of demand accompanying the global downturn, Malaysia remains one of Asia's ""most vibrant economies,"" according to the CIA World Factbook. Having won every election since independence, The Barisan National coalition dominates the political landscape -- which operates under a constitutional monarchy based on the British parliamentary model. After winning the 2004 general election by a landslide, however, the coalition was returned to power in 2008 with a significantly reduced majority. For the first time since 1957, the ruling alliance lost its two-thirds majority of the seats in Parliament (required to amend the Federal Constitution), and five of 13 federal states to the three opposition parties, which together form the Paktan Rakyat coalition. Despite this apparent political sea-change, a series of defections from other parties and by-election results since 2008 have left the Barisan National coalition just five seats short of regaining their two-thirds majority. Malaysia's large Muslim population live alongside people of other religions including Buddhists, Christians and Hindus. The rich mix of ethnicity, religions and historical influences is most vividly displayed in the nation's lively and animated culture. The self-styled ""Land of the Festivals"", Malaysia boasts hundreds of colorful celebrations throughout the year, ranging from religious holidays like ""Deepavli"" to secular parades such as the ""Flora Festival"". Malaysia is home to a UNESCO cultural world heritage site covering two towns. Melaka and George Town, in Penang state, are ""exceptional examples of multi-cultural trading towns in Southeast Asia,"" says the prestigious UN body. ""[They are] forged from the mercantile exchanges of Malay, Chinese, and Indian cultures and three successive European colonial powers for almost 500 years, each with its imprints on the architecture and urban form, technology and monumental art."" Displaying the same fertile blend of influences, Malaysia has ""one of the best assortments of delicious cuisines in the world,"" according to the Lonely Planet travel guide. A smorgasbord of Asian flavors, with dishes that include beef rendang (richly spiced dry beef curry) and nasi goreng (spicy, stir-fried rice), Malaysia's trade commission hopes that the national cuisine will eventually become one of the world's most sought after. Malaysia's natural habitat is even more diverse than its culture. According to the World Conservation Moderating Center, it is one of the 17 ""megadiverse"" countries which together harbor more than 70 percent of the earth's species. Over 58 percent of the land is occupied by tropical rainforests, that include long stretches of peat swamps and mangroves. Tourism is booming in Malaysia and, as the Word Travel Guide sums up, it's not difficult to understand why: . ""Tropical island resorts and endless white, sandy beaches offer a taste of paradise, while beneath warm coral seas, world-class dive sites await exploration. Orang-utans, the oldest rainforest in the world, city skyscrapers and majestic mosques and temples, plus a gorgeous coastline are enough to tempt even the most jaded visitor.""","With range of cultural influences, Malaysia is among most diverse countries in Asia .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 11 people have been killed and dozens wounded in a suicide attack Monday on a court building in the Pakistani capital, authorities said. Two militants threw hand grenades, fired guns and then blew themselves up at the district court building, said Sikander Hayat, inspector general of Islamabad police. Another police official, Jamil Hashmi, said that there were other armed attackers who opened fire and then left the scene. Police are still in the process of establishing exactly what happened, he said. Witnesses at the court building told CNN they saw two men firing indiscriminately at people. Attacks of this nature are rare in Pakistan's heavily policed capital. The Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, a complex that includes a hospital, reported the death toll of 11 and said 39 people were wounded in the attack. The dead included a judge, authorities said. The court building is in an upmarket residential district in central Islamabad. The area around the courts includes supermarkets, restaurants and coffee shops. A little-known organization calling itself Ahrar Ul Hind claimed it had carried out the attack. It targeted the courts because it considers them to be un-Islamic, said Asad Mansoor, a spokesman for the group. In a statement last month, Ahrar Ul Hind said that it had had ties with the Pakistani Taliban, but that the relationship had broken down because of the Taliban's focus on Pakistan's tribal areas. Ahrar Ul Hind claims it wants to impose Sharia, or Islamic law, in Pakistan, India and around the world. It says it aims to achieve its goal by carrying out attacks on cities. The Pakistani Taliban, which on Saturday declared a month-long cease-fire, denied any involvement with the Islamabad attack Monday. Shahidullah Shahid, a spokesman for the extremist group, said that the cease-fire was still in effect and that action would be taken against any faction that tried to break it. Asked last month about Ahrar Ul Hind, Shahid claimed the Taliban knew nothing about the organization. Attack targets polio workers in Pakistan, kills 11 .

"(CNN) -- ""The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: A Child-Lover's Code of Conduct"" was pulled from Amazon.com, a spokesman confirmed Thursday, after thousands of users posted angry comments and threats to boycott the site. The self-published e-book was available on the site for download until late Wednesday for $4.79. Company spokesman Drew Herdener would not comment on the controversy or respond to questions about the company's guidelines for digital publication. On Wednesday, Amazon defended selling the book in response to a report published on BusinessInsider.com. ""Amazon believes it is censorship not to sell certain books simply because we or others believe their message is objectionable. Amazon does not support or promote hatred or criminal acts, however, we do support the right of every individual to make their own purchasing decisions."" Before it disappeared from the site Wednesday night, the listing had more than 2,000 user comments. The vast majority of them condemned the book's stated content, as well as Amazon's decision to make it available. ""It is ILLEGAL to molest children, and for Amazon to promote such is insane. I'm an abuse survivor, and am OUTRAGED Amazon would choose to promote this nonsense. I will not be purchasing anything from your website until this is removed,"" one user wrote in a comment that summed up the feelings of many others. In its product description, the book's author described it as ""my attempt to make pedophile situations safer for those juveniles that find themselves involved in them, by establishing certian [sic] rules for these adults to follow."" ""I hope to achieve this by appealing to the better nature of pedosexuals, with hope that their doing so will result in less hatred and perhaps liter [sic] sentences should they ever be caught,"" he said. Author Phillip R. Greaves II told CNN that he published ""The Pedophile's Guide"" to address what he considers unfair portrayals of pedophiles in the media. ""True pedophiles love children and would never hurt them,"" the Pueblo, Colorado, man said in a phone interview Wednesday night. Greaves, 47, told CNN that he has not had sexual contact with a child as an adult, but did when he was a teenager. He also said he ""was introduced to oral sex when I was 7"" by an older female, but did not provide specifics. A small contingent of Amazon.com users defended the author's right to free speech, and a discussion on the site titled ""Why Amazon is Right"" delved into the constitutional implications of the controversy. Others floated the possibility that the e-book was a hoax or a law enforcement trap for pedophiles. ""While I think 99.9 percent of us object to pedophilia (even though I think this particular book was a publicity stunt/joke), I think we can all agree that we don't want someone else censoring a subject matter that we may be interested in. Religion, atheism, homosexuality, etc. are some subjects that spring to mind ... and they have been censored in the past until we realized that it's best to let all information in (even if we don't like some of it), rather than allow some authority or individual decide what we can and can't know about based on their own opinions or motivations,"" one user wrote.

"(CNN) -- Winning the Tour de France may be one of sport's toughest challenges but last year's winner Chris Froome believes the current generation of cyclists have an equally arduous task ahead of them. Through an accident of timing, the Briton says today's best racers are constantly having to prove to the world that they are riding clean. This is because they are unfortunate enough to follow an era where some of the biggest names in sport repeatedly shattered the illusions of cycling fans by failing doping tests. ""It's a challenge for the new generation of cyclists to be able to show people that the sport really has turned around -- and that doping is not something that's done any more,"" he told CNN World Sport. ""The pressure falls on us now. It's our burden but it does fall on us to tell people that the sport is no longer how it used to be."" The state of affairs is such that a virtuoso Froome display on the Mont Ventoux stage of the 2013 Tour did not receive wholehearted sporting acclaim but was forensically examined for evidence of cheating instead. The whispering and rumors were only silenced when Froome's Team Sky allowed French newspaper L'Equipe to study data from 18 of the Briton's previous climbs. ""I'm glad I was able to take on the questions,"" Froome told CNN at the time, shortly after a sports science expert found the data to be consistent with doping-free riding. ""I know what I've done to get here and I've nothing to hide."" Nonetheless, some riders still do fall prey to the temptations of yesteryear -- as proven when Italy's Danilo Di Luca was banned from the sport for life in December after being found guilty of a third doping offense. Two months ago, the president of the International Cycling Union (UCI) -- Brian Cookson -- created the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) with the intention of investigating both historic doping in cycling and allegations that the UCI had been involved in previous wrongdoing. The world governing body came under intense pressure last year after failing to detect the behavior of American Lance Armstrong, who famously won seven Tour de France races only to reveal that he had been doping throughout in an interview in January 2013. ""We can all agree that the Armstrong affair has done immense damage to our sport,"" Cookson, who ousted controversial leader Pat McQuaid last September, told CNN in February. ""Armstrong wants to be first through the door when the Commission is up and running, and I urge him and anyone else to participate."" With the case set to turn up the sport's unwanted past once again, the Kenyan-born Froome is realistic that the issue is one he will have to address time and again. ""It is going to be a question that is going to be asked for the foreseeable future, just because it has been such a big part of cycling and the results in cycling over the past decade,"" he said. ""Naturally, it's a question that we are going to have to face."" Tour of Omen? On a personal level, the other topic that will repeatedly come his way is whether he can retain the title he won so convincingly last year. Last month, he won the Tour of Oman -- which may prove an omen for some since Froome also won it in 2013. However, the rider himself is just delighted that he is in good shape to scale the many mountains -- both real and metaphorical -- heading his way. ""I'm in a very similar kind of condition to what I was last year just after the winter,"" the 28-year-old said. ""Oman is always a really good test to see how the winter training has been and how things have gone through the winter. So to come away with the title again is fantastic, a really good way to start the season.""","Chris Froome says current generation have to prove that cycling is now a clean sport .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- U.S. airstrikes aimed at al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan have been ""very effective,"" with few civilian deaths as a result, CIA Director Leon Panetta said Monday in a rare public acknowledgment of the raids. CIA Director Leon Panetta speaks about the fight against al Qaeda at the Pacific Council on International Policy. Asked about criticism of the missile attacks by counterinsurgency experts, Panetta said he did not want to discuss specifics, ""but I can assure you that in terms of that particular area, it is very precise and is very limited in terms of collateral damage."" ""Very frankly, it's the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al Qaeda leadership,"" Panetta told the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles. Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are airstrikes on its territory by U.S.-operated drones. The U.S. military in neighboring Afghanistan does not comment on the attacks, which typically target Islamic militants in the border region, but the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Panetta's predecessor, Michael Hayden, was asked about the drone attacks on Pakistani territory shortly before he left office in January, but addressed it far less directly than Panetta. ""I'm not going to talk about anything operational, and I'm not confirming or denying how any of this happens, we're not getting into that,"" he said. But he said he believed al Qaeda leaders had come to view Pakistan's tribal regions as ""neither safe nor a haven."" Two leading former advisers on counterinsurgency warfare, David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum, wrote in The New York Times over the weekend that the strikes have killed about 14 terrorist leaders in the past three years -- but Pakistani sources say the civilian death toll could be as high as 700. While U.S. officials dispute that ratio, Kilcullen and Exum wrote, ""Every one of these dead noncombatants represents an alienated family, a new desire for revenge and more recruits for a militant movement that has grown exponentially even as drone strikes have increased."" ""The persistence of these attacks on Pakistani territory offends people's deepest sensibilities, alienates them from their government and contributes to Pakistan's instability,"" Kilcullen and Exum said. They compared the tactics to British bombardment of the same region in the 1920s and French airstrikes on Algeria in the 1950s, arguing that the strikes were likely to remind Pakistanis of colonial rule. U.S. forces have been battling al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan since the terrorist network's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Both have taken root across the rugged border in Pakistan, where Pakistani troops are waging an air and ground offensive to crush the Taliban in the Swat Valley, northwest of the capital, Islamabad. Prime Minister Yusuf Reza Gilani said Monday that the offensive will go on ""until peace is established.""

"(CNN) -- People often ask me, especially after another young celebrity takes a fall, ""How did you raise two talented artists, both wonderful fathers, who both do such good work in the world?"" (One of my sons is the actor Matt Damon, the other, Kyle, is a sculptor). So many young stars seem to struggle and stumble under the pressure of their fame. Why do some handle it well while others go off the rails? There's no simple answer to this question. A lot happens in our children's lives that we parents can't control. From the beginning, children come to us with different personalities and temperaments; they are born into different cultures and economic circumstances. But we parents are the most important influence in their early lives, and what we do affects how our kids learn to handle the stresses life brings, whatever paths their lives take. One dimension of healthy childhood that gives kids a solid footing in life is having lots of child-centered play throughout the early years and even into grade school. Play is the most important vehicle children have for coping with life and making sense of it. Matt played pretend games for hours every day for many years -- making up stories, taking on roles and re-working his experiences in creative ways. Not only did all this play help build a strong sense of inner security in Matt, it also built up his capacity to imagine, create and invent ideas. I believe these years of child-centered play helped Matt become the actor and grounded person he is today. It is of great concern to me that there is less play in children's lives today than a generation ago. The hours spent in front of screens have replaced playtime outside school, and too much focus on academics and testing has eroded playtime inside schools. When kids are confused or scared or they don't understand things, they work it out in their play. Using their imagination, they rework things until they feel some sense of mastery. This is kids' ongoing way of coping with life and it is crucial for building inner resilience and security. That inner strength and resilience begins to develop at birth. It is first felt as a sense of trust in others -- adults who respond to cries of hunger and who can provide a home, safety and health. As time goes on, kids start to carry that security with them on the inside. Security will grow or weaken in childhood depending a lot on how we adults relate to our children in everyday interactions. When we are too heavy-handed with our authority, kids often feel insecure or fearful. When we punish them or use threats and timeouts or other coercive tactics, they might try to obey on the surface, but they aren't building the inner strength and confidence that will be their moral compass when we are not there. We don't really have to over-use our adult authority with children. We can work out most things with them -- listening to their feelings and needs and taking these into account as much as possible. When we listen to kids with our full attention and try to say back to them what we heard without judging it or giving our own opinion, they feel great trust in us and in themselves. And this kind of listening prevents many conflicts from escalating or from happening in the first place. Of course children need limits, but not the kind that are imposed by ""Do as I say."" Recently I was walking on busy streets with my 5-year-old grandson Jake. He pulled his hand from mine. I asked, ""You don't want to hold my hand?"" ""No,"" he said, ""I want to walk by myself."" I said, ""How about this: On the sidewalk you walk alone and when we cross the street, you hold my hand, because there are so many cars zooming around."" Jake nodded yes and took my hand when we got to the street. This simple example shows a way of being with children, of being on the same side with them, working things out with them -- something we can do almost all the time. It is a way of being that helps to strengthen children's inner security and confidence in their own ideas. Schools are the other big influence in our children's lives. Children spend about half their waking hours in school and what happens there has a big part to play in the inner confidence and social responsibility they develop. I sent my sons Kyle and Matt to a public high school where community participation, respect for differences, learning empathy and concern for others were part of daily school life. The school had an excellent drama program, another reason why I wanted to send Matt there. All kids who wanted to participate in the school's stellar ensemble productions could. Matt wasn't a ""star."" He was on equal footing with all the other kids. Stardom can be confusing for a teen -- it's a time of figuring out who you are and how you fit into what suddenly seems like a much bigger world. Matt's high school drama experiences gave him a rock solid start in theater -- he worked hard at his craft and found delight and meaning in collaboration. Matt Damon: Together we can solve the world water crisis . I believe that schools should be places not only for academic learning, but also where young people build confidence, a sense of self, and learn to become responsible citizens. It is one of the great tragedies of our day that our schools, excessively driven by data and standardized tests, have no time for activities that can't be tested. No time for the arts and play and the social and emotional learning that will help children handle what life has in store. Although we parents can't control everything that happens in our kids' lives, we can do a lot to help them build inner security, confidence and a strong inner moral compass that will guide them through challenges they will face when we are no longer there. And our schools should build on this foundation. We should insist that our schools address not just academics, but the whole child -- so that all our children can become healthy and strong and enter adulthood as responsible and caring citizens. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nancy Carlsson-Paige.","Nancy Carlsson-Paige, Matt Damon's mom, is often asked how she raised her children .

"(CNN) -- NFL player Richie Incognito wants an expedited hearing on his suspension from the Miami Dolphins so he can return to the field soon. Incognito filed a ""non-injury grievance"" against the Dolphins, who suspended him for conduct detrimental to the team earlier this month, according to the NFL Players Association. Incognito said in an interview last weekend that his alleged bullying of Miami Dolphin teammate Jonathan Martin is misunderstood because ""people don't know how Jon and I communicate to one another."" Martin, 24, left the team last month because of ""harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing,"" Martin's lawyer said. Days later, Incognito, 30, was suspended. ""The grievance challenges his suspension for conduct which was alleged to have occurred while he was with the club,"" the association's statement said. ""In the grievance, Incognito requests that the hearing be held on an expedited basis so that he can immediately resume playing for the team."" The Dolphins declined CNN's request for comment on the filing. ""Our organizational policy is not to comment on grievance matters,"" a team spokesman said. Dolphins owner: ""We need to look at ourselves"" The NFL appointed veteran lawyer Ted Wells to investigate the controversy surrounding Martin's departure and Incognito's suspension. Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said he called for the independent investigation by the NFL because he knew the objectivity of a team investigation could be questioned. ""We need to look at ourselves,"" Ross said. ""We have to examine everything internally. I know that this is so appalling to me."" But Ross also said he wanted to avoid overreacting. He formed a committee to help guide the changes, including former Dolphin coach Don Shula and quarterback Dan Marino. ""We all know that the football locker room is a different workplace than most of us are accustomed to,"" Ross said. ""Basically, I don't want to make any excuses. I want to know that our workplace going onward will be the best workplace that you can find in the NFL."" Incognito acknowledged in an interview aired on ""Fox NFL Sunday"" that he used racist and vulgar language in voice mails and text messages to Martin but said it was ""coming from a place of love."" ""No matter how bad and how vulgar it sounds, that's how we communicate,"" he told Fox Sports reporter Jay Glazer. ""That's how our friendship was."" ""For instance, a week before this went down, Jonathan Martin text me on my phone 'I will murder your whole F-ing family,'"" Incognito told Glazer. ""Now, do I think Jonathan Martin was going to murder my family? Not one bit."" Dolphins owner delays meeting with Jonathan Martin . While Martin has not spoken publicly since the controversy erupted, his attorney David Cornwell broke the silence on his behalf with a prepared statement last week. Martin tried ""to befriend ... teammates who subjected him to the abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment"" -- something Cornwell called ""a textbook reaction of victims of bullying."" The taunting did not stop, however, the lawyer said. He cited ""a malicious physical attack on him by a teammate and daily vulgar comments,"" and a threat of a group sexual assault against Martin's sister. ""Eventually, Jonathan made a difficult choice,"" Cornwell said of Martin leaving the Dolphins. ""... Jonathan looks forward to getting back to playing football. In the meantime, he will cooperate fully with the NFL investigation."" ""The face of bullying in America"" ""Right, wrong or indifferent, because of all this, you've become the face of bullying in America,"" Glazer told Incognito. ""Someone thinks of a bully, they think of Richie Incognito."" ""This isn't an issue about bullying,"" Incognito said. ""This is an issue of my and Jon's relationship, where I've taken stuff too far, and I didn't know it was hurting him."" A profanity-filled voice mail from Incognito to Martin that has been made public was intended to shock him so ""his buddy"" would call him back, he said. ""I understand why a lot of eyebrows get raised,"" Incognito said, ""when people don't know how Jon and I communicate to one another."" Richie Incognito, Jonathan Martin, and the NFL's future .

"(Mental Floss) -- With South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford dominating the news, let's look back at a five other so-called virtuous figures who became embroiled in sex scandals -- and this list just scratches the surface. Jim Bakker admitted to cheating on his  wife Tammy Faye Bakker. 1. Aimee Semple McPherson . By the mid-1920s, evangelist McPherson was packing them in at her Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, preaching hope and warning against the sinful life. But in 1926, she disappeared while swimming at a local beach. She turned up a month later with a fantastic story about being kidnapped and taken to Mexico. Unfortunately, the evidence said otherwise: It appeared Aimee had been shacked up with a married man. The evangelist was charged with perjury, but she stuck to her story and was eventually acquitted. Her popularity waned after the scandal, but you gotta hand it to her for chutzpah: instead of apologizing to her confused flock, McPherson bobbed her hair, bought some short skirts, and began dancing and drinking in public. 2. Jim Bakker . Simple people with a simple dream, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker started out hosting a children's religious puppet show. By the mid-1970s, however, the fabulous Bakker duo had become the toast of televangelism. They pulled in millions of dollars in contributions to their PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry, and even built a sort of fundamentalist Disneyland called Heritage USA in South Carolina. Mental Floss: Proposing the presidential way . But Jim had a couple of dirty little secrets. He had paid a former church secretary named Jessica Hahn to keep quiet about a sexual encounter they had in 1980. But when the scandal broke in 1987, questions began to be raised about Bakker's financial dealings. In 1989, he was sentenced to 45 years in prison for fleecing his flock of $158 million. In the end he only served five, and moved forward with his life, eventually opening a new ministry in a restaurant in Branson, Missouri. Mental Floss: 10 great love affairs in history . 3. Jimmy Swaggart . Swaggart was one of Jim Bakker's fiercest critics when the Bakker scandal broke, telling an interviewer he himself had never even kissed a woman other than his wife. Maybe not. But the bombastic and fantastically successful television preacher -- and cousin to rock-and-roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis -- was doing something with that prostitute in a cheap New Orleans hotel room in early 1988. Swaggart's tearful, televised confession kept his $12-million-a-year, 10,000-employee religious empire together -- until he got caught with his pants down again. That's right, Jimmy Swaggart was linked to (brace yourself!) another hooker in 1991. A couple of lost lawsuits, an IRS tax lien, and that was the end of the line for Jimmy Swaggart. Well, not exactly. He's still hurling rhetorical fire and brimstone on TV, radio and online, albeit on a much smaller scale. Mental Floss: 10 aphrodisiacs around the world . 4. Amrit Desai . A onetime art student, Amrit Desai came to the United States from India in 1960. He began giving yoga lessons on the side and ended up training several thousand people, who in turn became yoga instructors around the country. With his followers calling him ""guru dev,"" or ""beloved teacher,"" one of the things Desai taught at the yoga center he founded in Massachusetts in 1972 was that celibacy was spiritually mandatory for unmarried people. Desai even took a vow of celibacy himself in 1974, despite being married with children. No wonder it was something of a shock (perhaps greatest to his wife) when in 1994, the beloved teacher admitted to having affairs with three of his followers. The scandal forced Desai to resign his $150,000-a-year post. He eventually moved to Florida, but kept up the yoga. 5. Paul R. Shanley . In the 1970s, Shanley was known as ""the hippie priest""; he was a Roman Catholic clergyman whose specialty was ministering to kids struggling with their sexual identity. By 2002, however, Shanley was a central figure in the greatest scandal ever to hit the Catholic Church in the United States. Shanley was accused of molesting more than two dozen boys over a 35-year span. Subsequent investigations into other allegations in the Boston archdiocese resulted in the Church paying $85 million in 2003 to 552 people who claimed to have been abused by priests. It also triggered similar probes, and similar results, in other areas of the country. In 2005, at the age of 74, Shanley was sentenced to 12 to 15 years in prison.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Rebels battling for control of northern Yemen clashed against tribesmen on Friday, leaving dozens dead in fighting just miles from the country's capital, officials told CNN. At least 42 people were killed and more than a dozen injured in clashes between Houthi Shiite militants and fighters from the Sunni Hashid tribe in the Amran province, which is seen as a linchpin to controlling the region, according to two security officials and a local tribal leader. The reports of fighting come as cease-fire negotiations are under way to put an end to the fighting that has plagued Yemen since late last year, spurred in part by a power vacuum left by the departure of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Tensions between the rebel Houthis and the Hashid, which includes Sunni tribesmen and conservative Islamic Salafists, began to rise last October, when the Houthis blamed the Hashid for standing behind the killing of one of its members. Earlier this month, President Abdurabu Hadi helped negotiate a short-lived truce. Cease-fire negotiations were set to resume with both sides on Sunday, according to officials. There were countering claims by the two sides about who had gained ground in the fighting. The Hashid tribe claimed victory over the Houthis in the Amran province towns of Khaiwan and Dannan, Fawzy al-Jaradi, a tribal spokesman said. But the Houthis denied the claim, with the group's spokesman Mohammed AbdulSalam claiming their fighters gained territory. Meanwhile, at least 15 Yemeni soldiers were killed and three injured Friday when masked gunmen attacked a military post in the Yemeni province of Hadramout, three senior security officials told CNN. Further details about the attack, including who was behind it, weren't immediately available. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, believed by many analysts to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror network.","Shiite militants are battling Sunni tribesmen in northern Yemen .

"Canberra, Australia (CNN) -- President Barack Obama declared Thursday that the United States will take an expanded role in shaping the Asian Pacific region, with an increased military presence one step of that policy. ""Our enduring interests in the region demand our enduring presence in this region,"" Obama said in a speech to the Australian Parliament. ""The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay."" On Wednesday, his government announced an agreement with Australia that will expand military cooperation between the longtime allies and boost America's presence in the region. In Thursday's speech, Obama made clear that the military expansion is a top priority in the wake of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, even as the United States faces the need to reduce mounting federal deficits and debt. ""As we end today's wars, I have directed my national security team to make our presence and missions in the Asia Pacific a top priority,"" Obama said. ""As a result, reductions in U.S. defense spending will not -- I repeat, will not -- come at the expense of the Asia Pacific."" The speech on the second day of his two-day trip to Australia, Obama's first as president, signaled a policy objective to compete head-on with China for influence in the region while also providing security assurances for allies. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters that the policy comes in part from nations of the region seeking increased U.S. presence. ""The ability of the United States to help respond to contingencies is something that has been welcomed in recent years, whether, again, it was work that we're doing in the Philippines to counter violent extremism, work that we're doing to counter piracy in the region, the response to the tsunami in Indonesia,"" Rhodes said. ""So in other words, there's a demand signal from the nations of the region, and this is something that we're doing in concert with one of our closest allies. So we believe it's not just entirely appropriate, but an important step to dealing with the challenges of the future of the Asia Pacific region."" Under the military agreement announced Wednesday, up to 250 U.S. Marines will be sent to Darwin and the northern region of Australia for military exercises and training. Over the next several years their numbers are expected to climb to 2,500 -- a full Marine ground task force. In addition, Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael Keltz, director of strategic planning and policy for the U.S. Pacific Command, told journalists in a telephone call Wednesday from Hawaii that the United States has based some of its most sophisticated weapons in the Pacific, including squadrons of F-22 fighters and C-17 transport planes. The F-22s provide leading-edge technology for potential air-to-air combat as well as cyber- and electronic warfare,"" Keltz said. They replaced older F-15s, he added. Keltz details U.S. military power in Pacific . While U.S. officials cited the need to respond to regional natural disasters as a reason for the agreement, concern over China's military expansion is widely acknowledged as a driving factor. ""What we look at is how does our general force posture allow us to protect U.S. interests, protect our allies, and ... secure the region broadly,"" Rhodes said. ""China is obviously a piece of the Asia Pacific region, an emerging power."" Rhodes later added that the deal is ""part of the U.S. sending a signal that we're going to be present, that we're going to continue to play the role of underpinning security in this part of the region. Part of that context is a rising China."" In China, a foreign ministry spokesman questioned the appropriateness of an increased U.S. military presence in Australia. Analysts note that the deal sends a message to China in a less confrontational way than building up bases closer to Chinese shores. ""The Chinese can squawk about it,"" said Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. ""But it's not like having an aircraft carrier in the Yellow Sea."" Obama himself, however, insisted during a Wednesday news conference that ""the notion that we fear China is mistaken."" The president's Australian visit -- postponed twice in 2009 and 2010 due to the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and other domestic political considerations -- highlights a changing balance of power in the Pacific as China expands its military reach and the United States works to reduce its military footprint in Japan. Obama's Australian visit comes on the heels of last weekend's 19-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which highlighted the need for new measures supporting job growth. During the Hawaiian summit, Obama stressed the importance of the Pacific to global economic security, and he pushed China to do more to help strengthen the world economy. After wrapping up his visit to Australia, Obama will conclude his Pacific trip with a stop in Indonesia -- a country he spent several years living in during his childhood. CNN's Charley Keyes, Tom Cohen and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","NEW: ""The United States is a Pacific power,"" Obama says in Australia .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The cemetery was mazelike before the earthquake, but now it's impossible to navigate, with many of the narrow passages blocked by rubble. It takes Vladimir Duthiers an hour to reach his destination. He steps over coffins that people have pulled out of old crypts and replaced with the earthquake's dead. Some plaques have been spray-painted over: ""RIP January 12, 2010."" Skulls. Bones. Stench. Flies. In one crypt is a fresh body, covered sloppily with a gray blanket issued by an aid agency. A cardboard sign carries a name: Hilaire Nicaisse. Duthiers, 40, has come to find his family's crypt where, among others, the grandparents he never knew are buried. On this afternoon, the CNN production assistant wants to make sure no one had disturbed the peace of his ancestors and to learn as much as he can from dates and names that might be engraved in stone. News organizations such as CNN sent their Haitian employees to cover the nation's national agony. And for those journalists, like Duthiers and colleague Edvige Jean-François, it was a bittersweet homecoming -- a chance to reconnect with roots amid heartbreak. This was hardly the way Duthiers had hoped to discover his homeland. Born and raised in a fractured immigrant home in New York, he grew up hearing snippets about his culture and ancestors. He had wanted to come here so many years ago, but his own career and political turmoil in Haiti got in the way. His longing was that of a child searching for his mother; his determination like that of a mountaineer determined to conquer Everest. Duthiers was last in Haiti in 1980. The next time he touched Haitian soil was with a CNN team that landed in the capital the day after the January 12 earthquake. In an instant, long-held images were gone. Everywhere he stepped, Duthiers found suffering. All he could do now was to visit his family grave site. Duthiers continues his snaking journey through the cemetery, recounting stories of his grandmother. Some, he admits, have probably grown to epic proportions over the years. But he wants to keep it that way. He heard that his grandmother, Jeanne Caillet, was a Sorbonne-educated journalist working in France between the great wars and was repeatedly jailed, and perhaps beaten, for her participation in the suffragist movement. The abuse broke her spirit. She returned to Haiti and died three days after giving birth to Duthiers' father. Duthiers scales rubble, looking for markers that will lead him to Caillet. Then in section CB-26, in front of a collapsed church, Duthiers falls to his knees before a crypt bearing his family name. It stands intact except for a few chunks that have fallen out here and there. He's relieved. But what were the exact dates of his grandparents' deaths? When were they born? What were their astrological signs? He had hoped to discover all this from the gravestones, but information is sparse. ""This is as close as I'll get to them,"" he says, touching the grave. ""This is a little bit of heaven in the middle of hell."" He picks up a metal cross that has fallen to the ground. He thinks about placing it on the crypt, but then leaves it where it was. He couldn't be sure it belonged to his family. Cosmic circumstances, he says, brought his family to this land that they loved. From Africa, France, the Dominican Republic. Ironically, he says, it is on this trip that he has begun to understand. ""They thought this was the place to be. Now I can feel what they felt,"" he says. He says a last goodbye and makes his way back on sacred ground. It is time for Duthiers to accompany colleague Jean-François on her journey, so they go to another cemetery to find her father's resting place. He had retired in the United States and moved back home to Port-au-Prince in 1996. He died a year ago. Like Duthiers, Jean-François, 41, arrived in Port-au-Prince the day after the quake. It was unbearable to see her beloved city flattened, to be near the tens of thousands who were dead or suffering. Now, toward the end of an arduous assignment, Jean-François has grown anxious. She cannot leave without visiting her father's grave, her parents' home. She is afraid that if the grave has been disturbed, she will have to rebury him. But this cemetery, far from central Port-au-Prince, is untouched. ""It's good to see it intact,"" she says, gazing upward at a wall of crypts and counting six from the bottom to No. 2226. White plastic flowers are tucked neatly in front. She was once in this place with her family at a ceremony for her father. ""It's just the way it was a year ago,"" she says, drying her tears. She feels an odd guilt for having spent time finding the dead when so many of the living are suffering. But she could not leave Haiti without visiting the man to whom she still talks to find strength. Duthiers and Jean-François make one last stop -- to the house in which her parents had planned to live out their days. After her father's death, her mother has been spending much of her time in the United States. The white tiles are still sparkling. The neatly appointed bathrooms, never used. Jean-François meanders room to room, stumbling upon a rug still rolled up in its shipping material. And a box full of photographs. ""There I am -- my high school graduation,"" she says. With that, the two make their way back to the hotel. They carry with them a message to visitors at the main Port-au-Prince cemetery, centuries of wisdom crudely painted above the main gate: ""Now is the time to think about yourself.""","CNN production assistant visits family crypt to check on damage, learn about his ancestors .

"Jerusalem (CNN)  -- Dubai's police chief said Sunday the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit Mossad ""needs to be ashamed"" after the January killing of a Hamas leader in a Dubai hotel. ""I am now 100 percent sure that the Mossad is behind the assassination"" of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, said Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim. ""I used to say 99 percent but now I can say 100 percent."" Al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing, was found dead in his Dubai hotel room on January 20. Police believe he was killed the night before, and have identified some 26 suspects in his death. Israel has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming or denying involvement. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, however, told Israel Army Radio earlier this month, ""There is certainly no reason to think that the Mossad and not some other intelligence agency of another country operated there."" Lieberman has also said only ""media reports"" link Israel to the slaying. Asked about the case on Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak repeatedly refused to make any comment. ""You know me long enough to assume that when I tell you I have nothing to say about this story, I have nothing to say, and I will not say,"" Barak told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""The Mossad needs to be ashamed of its actions,"" Tamim said Sunday. ""They sent 26, 27 persons to assassinate one man who was involved in the capturing and killing of two Israeli solders."" Hamas has said al-Mabhouh was behind the 1989 deaths of the two soldiers. Earlier Sunday, police said toxicology results showed that al-Mabhouh was injected with succinylcholine, a drug used to relax muscles during surgery or as an anesthetic, before he was suffocated. Signs indicated that al-Mabhouh resisted as he was being suffocated, police said. Family members were told earlier that police had found blood on a pillow. Authorities have also said the killers left some of al-Mabhouh's medication next to him in an apparent effort to make the death appear natural. But ""the medication left next to him in the room has nothing to do with the killing,"" Tamim said Sunday. However, authorities have recovered evidence including DNA, he said. ""The DNA evidence is quite important and will help us with the investigation."" The 26 suspects are believed to have acquired false passports to travel to Dubai for the killing, then scattered to several far-flung locations afterward. But ""not all the 26 people have forged passports,"" Tamim said Sunday. ""We know some of the names are real."" The 26 do not include two Palestinians previously arrested in Jordan and returned to Dubai. Tamim said one is not believed to be directly involved in al-Mabhouh's death, but ""he is wanted by one of the Palestinian factions in the Palestinian territories and he is sentenced to death and that's why we will extradite him."" He refused to discuss anything about the other Palestinian. Twelve of the suspects used British passports, police said. Six suspects used Irish passports, four used French passports, three used Australian passports and one used a German passport. On Sunday, the British Embassy in Israel said it plans to talk to the British nationals whose identities were stolen and passports were used. ""We have made contact with six of the individuals and look to locate the remaining six for the fraudulent use of their identities,"" an embassy official said Sunday.

"(CNN) -- It will be cold when kickoff time rolls around for the Super Bowl, but nothing out of the ordinary for a northeastern winter. Forecasts show that a break in the weather might come just in time, providing a dry -- if chilly -- field of play on Sunday night. Super Bowl XLVIII kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET Sunday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Temperatures will rise just before the match-up between the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos to the low 40s, and it will feel like the high 30s once you measure the wind chill, CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray said. The National Weather Service says it will be cloudy with a slight chance of showers in the area. Gray said most of the showers will be off shore and to expect dry conditions at the game. It could snow later, the weather service said, but after the game is over. Elsewhere across the country, winter weather advisories on Saturday stretched from Oklahoma northward into Missouri, Illinois and Michigan. Snow totals of 4 to 8 inches are possible in this region.","It will be cold, but relatively dry for the Super Bowl .

"(CNN) -- Thais Mills was looking forward to taking her 7-year-old niece to see ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Friday evening at 8:15. But in the wake of the shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater, the 31-year-old from New Orleans said she would surrender the movie tickets she bought for about $20 in advance. ""I just feel like now the movie theater is, it's not a place of peace,"" Mills said. ""Think about how vulnerable you are. You're in a dark room sitting next to people you don't know. Until something is concocted that can ensure my safety, I just feel more comfortable at the house."" But not all moviegoers will steer clear of the theater. Despite the many users on social networking sites who echoed Mills' grief and fear, more than 2,000 people were checked in to ""The Dark Knight Rises"" on GetGlue as of 11:30 a.m. Friday. CNN asked readers what they thought on Facebook. ""I still went and saw it,"" said a Facebook user named Christopher Vento. ""Tragedy happens every day. We must not let fear govern our lives."" Another poster, Jeanne Ballinger Sedgwick, said she did not plan on seeing the Batman film, but was hesitant to attend a different midnight showing. ""I don't think I'll feel safe sitting in a theater to see any popular movie for quite some time. I don't think that would ever happen here, but neither did those poor people sitting there in the dark theater last night in Aurora."" Twitter user @sophiacrowley wrote: ""I refuse to live in fear, this won't deter me from going to the movies anymore than 9/11 stopped me from flying."" Other users expressed similar sentiments, tweeting, ""It's sad what happened but it's not going to stop me from going about my daily life or even going to the movies."" For former film critic Steven Senski, avoiding the theater isn't the answer. However, the 49-year-old Muskego, Wisconsin, resident who managed a movie theater in 2003, said he's ""very much disinclined to attend a midnight showing."" Shooting casts pall over 'Dark Knight Rises' blockbuster weekend . ""Midnight showings are, and have always had a unique certain air about them,"" Senski said. ""You do bring in patrons fresh from the bar, patrons who are sleep deprived, and in cases like 'The Dark Knight Rises,' you bring in people who may be dressed, costumed. It is a very joyous atmosphere, but it feels out of the theater's control."" Both Senski and Mills agree that one reason so many people enjoy going to the movies is because it offers an escape from reality. ""A movie theater should be one of the safest places you can be,"" Senski said. ""When we go to the theater, when the lights come down, there's that feeling of ... whatever your problems, whatever your concerns, you're going to set them aside for two hours and hopefully be entertained."" Though Warner Bros., the studio behind the movie, canceled its Paris premiere, it said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the incident but would not cancel any screenings. Infants too young for late-night movies? The Department of Homeland Security reissued a checklist to theater operators, covering security and emergency procedures. It also reminded them to ensure their staffs are properly trained. The National Association of Theatre Owners, which represents more than 30,000 movie screens, said it was ""working closely with local law enforcement agencies and reviewing security procedures."" ""On behalf of all the members and staff of the National Association of Theatre Owners, our hearts and prayers go out to the victims of this despicable act and their families,"" a statement says. ""We are grateful for the quick and effective response by police and emergency personnel. Guest safety is, and will continue to be a priority for theater owners."" Some police departments and theaters around the country tightened security on Friday. William J. Bratton, chairman of Kroll Advisory Solutions, which provides risk consulting, said he did not expect decreased attendance at theaters showing ""The Dark Knight Rises."" ""This type of shooting could occur at a ball park, a concert, it could occur anywhere,"" said Bratton. ""This appears to be, fortunately, an isolated incident."" Police departments can't afford to patrol theaters over the long term, he said. ""In America today, there is no need to significantly increase security in our public spaces,"" said Bratton, former Los Angeles police chief. ""You respond to threats, but with millions of public spaces, we don't live in a police state."" He said he expects some lessons will be learned from Friday's horrific incident. He cited notification systems that grew out of the Columbine and Virginia Tech attacks. ""Some of the larger (theater) chains might go for some enhanced security theaters. Some of the smaller ones won't be able,"" he said. Mills, a Katrina survivor, said, ""There has to be a sense of togetherness to get us through,"" and it will take time before she feels comfortable going to the movie theater again. Theater shooting unfolds in real time over social media . Her niece, who watched the tragedy unfold on TV, ""is more than shaken up,"" Mills said, noting the pair typically see one movie together every week. ""It's the most affordable form of outdoor entertainment,"" she added. Still, her niece's safety and peace of mind come first. ""I'm going to have to keep a close eye on her and see where her comfort levels are, but for now we'll just be enjoying some old DVDs.""

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey grand jury declined to indict a mother accused of child endangerment for allegedly allowing her 5-year-old daughter to use a tanning bed, resulting in leg burns, prosecutors said Tuesday. New Jersey law bans children under 14 years old from using tanning salons. Patricia Krentcil, 44, of Nutley, New Jersey, pleaded not guilty last May to second-degree child endangerment and has been free on $25,000 bail. The girl remained in her parents' custody during the grand jury proceedings. The Essex County, New Jersey, grand jury issued its ""no bill"" Tuesday, said Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn A. Murray. ""The decision to no bill the case became official today,"" said a statement from Murray's office. ""That ends the Essex County Prosecutor's Office involvement with this matter."" Last April, school officials noticed burns on the girl's legs and reported the injuries to authorities. Following an investigation, Krentcil was arrested on April 24, 2012, prosecutors said. ""We presented all the available evidence in the case to the grand jury, both the state's evidence and the defense's evidence. The grand jurors voted not to indict Mrs. Krentcil. We respect their decision,'' Assistant Prosecutor Gina Iosim said in a statement. She presented the case to the grand jury. Prosecutors had accused Krentcil of allowing her daughter inside a stand-up tanning booth at a salon in the northern New Jersey town of Nutley. Last year, Krentcil's attorney said that Krentcil allowed her daughter to accompany her to the salon, but never allowed the girl into a booth.","Patricia Krentcil, 44, is accused of second-degree child endangerment .

"(CNN) -- Night had fallen. Some 20 airplane passengers had taken their seats for the short hop from Brussels, Belgium, to Zurich, Switzerland. Unknown to them, a precious cargo was being loaded into the airplane hold along with their suitcases: $50 million in rough and polished diamonds. But the diamonds would never reach their final destination. Shortly before 8 p.m. Monday, eight masked men in two vehicles burst through the perimeter fence of Brussels Airport and sped toward the aircraft on the tarmac. The men, who authorities said wore clothing resembling police uniforms, were heavily armed. While no shots were fired and no one was injured, the pilot, co-pilot and a transport security guard were all threatened at gunpoint, said Ine Van Wymersch, of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Brussels. Within three minutes, the thieves had snatched the diamonds from the hold, said airport spokesman Jan Van der Cruysse. Drag queens, fake beards and chocolates: Notable diamond heists . Moments later they left the scene, racing out through the same breach in the airport periphery through which they had entered. The robbers, four in each car, had broken a hole in the fence where it ran between two construction sites, Van Wymersch said at a news conference. ""This was a very precise, almost military-organized and well-executed robbery,"" Van der Cruysse said. He said it was a ""big surprise"" that such a slick heist been possible -- but pointed the finger at organized crime. ""We are an airport that is, as all international airports are, subject to very strict aviation security and safety regulations,"" he said. The aircraft targeted was a regular passenger flight operated by Helvetic Airways on behalf of Swiss, Switzerland's national airline. It's not yet clear how the thieves knew that the diamonds would be on board. But this was not a chance holdup, said Van Wymersch, describing the men involved as ""professionals."" Antwerp, the city known as the world's diamond-cutting capital, lies only about 25 miles away from Brussels. The Antwerp World Diamond Centre has on average $200 million in stones coming in and out daily, and it takes security very seriously, a spokesman told CNN. He was unable to confirm reports that gold and platinum were stolen along with the diamonds. It's not the first time that Antwerp's centuries-old diamond trade has been targeted. The city was the scene of a spectacular robbery in 2003 when thieves made off with the contents of more than 100 safes at the diamond center. Those gems were never recovered. Some 34,000 jobs in the city are connected to the diamond trade, according to the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, from mining company representatives to dealers to the craftsmen who polish the stones.

"(CNN) -- Farmers are on their way to tend their crops when a missile slams into their midst, thrusting shrapnel in all directions. A CIA drone, flying so high that the farmers can't see it, has killed most of them. None of them were militants. Such attacks by U.S. drones are common, the United Nations' special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights said Friday in a statement on strikes in Pakistan's tribal region of North Waziristan. The rapporteur, Ben Emmerson, told CNN the actions are of dubious international legality, despite the United States' assertions. ""I'm not aware of any state in the world that currently shares the United States' expansive legal perspective that it is engaged in a global war -- that is to say a non-international armed conflict with al Qaeda and any group associated with al Qaeda, wherever they are to be found, that would therefore lawfully entitle the United States to take action involving targeted killing wherever an individual is found,"" Emmerson said. The American Civil Liberties Union and other U.S. groups are questioning the legitimacy of the President Obama-approved drone program, and they're looking for evidence for a legal battle. On Friday, a U.S. federal appeals court ruled the CIA must acknowledge the existence of any records related to military unmanned drone strikes targeting individuals, such as overseas terror suspects. The ACLU and others had filed a Freedom of Information Act request, but the CIA refused to confirm or deny it had any such records, citing national security. Emmerson has just returned from Pakistan, where he listened to residents of North Waziristan talk about terrifying encounters with one of America's weapons in the war on terror. ""Adult males carrying out ordinary daily tasks were frequently the victims of such strikes,"" the statement from the U.N. office for human rights said. First on CNN: Iran confronts U.S. drone over Persian Gulf . Some Pashtun men dress the same as Taliban members from the same region, hence the drone operators mistake them for terror targets, the statement said. It is also customary for Pashtun men to carry a weapon, making them virtually indistinguishable from militants to an outsider. A beard and a turban . A Pakistani tribal elder who spoke with CNN noted hasty judgments based on appearances can be wrong. ""Just because I have a beard and wear a turban, does that make me part of the Taliban?"" asked Malik Jalaluddin. The United States has 8,000 drones, unmanned planes and helicopters flown by a remote control. They are outfitted with a video camera to help the operator spot targets and often armed with weapons used to neutralize them. President Barack Obama has told CNN that a target must meet ""very tight and very strict standards."" CIA director John Brennan has said that only in ""exceedingly rare"" cases have civilians been ""accidentally injured, or worse, killed in these strikes."" Reports back the U.N. conclusion . Reports by independent groups corroborate Emmerson's account, concluding that drones mistakenly target and kill a significant number of civilians. The New America Foundation estimates that in Pakistan, drones have killed between 1,953 and 3,279 people since 2004 - and that between 18% and 23% of them were not militants. The nonmilitant casualty rate was down to about 10% in 2012, the group says. A study by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates that since 2004, Pakistan has had 365 drone strikes that have killed between 2,536 and 3,577 people -- including 411 to 884 civilians. The study concludes that the strikes have killed far more people than the United States has acknowledged, and traumatized many more innocent people. That trauma is destroying a way of life, Emmerson said. ""The Pashtun tribes of the ... area have suffered enormously under the drone campaign."" And tribal law prescribes revenge for the killing of a tribe member, which serves to radicalize more young men against the United States, he said. Pakistan considers the strikes counterproductive, illegal and a violation of its sovereignty.

"(CNN) -- He may not have started from the top of the mountain but it was still a dream downhill for Patrick Kueng as he skied to victory at the World Cup event in Wengen. The course at the Swiss Alpine resort is renowned as the longest downhill course on the World Cup calendar at 4.4 kilometers (2.12 miles) long but high winds Saturday meant the skiers had to start their runs lower down the slope. Victory still tasted sweet for Switzerland's Kueng, who beat Austrian Hannes Reichelt and Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal with a time of one minute 32.66 seconds. ""Since I was a kid, I've been watching this race,"" the 30-year-old told reporters. ""My first dream was to race it and my second dream was to win it. ""In 2006 I had a terrible accident in which I broke one leg and broke the ankle in my other leg. I ended up in a wheelchair and my thoughts did turn to quitting. ""It was a very tough time, but when I decided to continue, it was nothing but 100 per cent. Eventually I got a World Cup spot and now I'm here!""

"(CNN) -- For generations, hundreds of millions of sports fans have seen the iconic Goodyear blimp hanging out above stadiums across the nation. Ever wonder how the thing actually flies? This 192-foot-long aircraft is a machine with its own set of rules. It's very different from an airplane. For one, obviously, it has no wings. Two, it typically flies about 1,500 feet above the ground. Compare that with New York's Chrysler building, which towers about 1,050 feet high. And another thing: Goodyear's blimps move ... very ... slowly. They max out at about 53 mph but usually they cruise at a conservative 35 mph. Here are three basic things to know about blimps: . -- Blimps belong to a family of aircraft called ""airships,"" defined as aircraft that don't use wings to fly. Instead they are lifted by helium. -- What's a blimp, exactly? A blimp is an airship that has no internal framework to keep its helium gas bag rigid. That giant gas bag is what pilots call the ""envelope."" -- Pilots power and steer blimps with two propeller engines and a moveable tail and rudder system. We'll have more on exactly how it all works later this week after CNN flies above Atlanta's Chick-fil-A Bowl Tuesday night with Goodyear blimp pilot Matt Lussier and camera operator Tom O'Keefe. Lussier's flying background is rooted in airplanes. But to learn to fly a blimp, he says, ""you have to throw a lot of that away. This is a real seat-of-your-pants flyer. I mean, you feel it. You wear it."" Compared with blimps, airplanes respond very quickly. But flying a blimp is an exercise in anticipation. You have to anticipate what the ship's going to do before it does it. Then, almost as soon as a shift starts happening, you have to reverse it because otherwise it will keep happening long after you want it to stop. Belle of the bowls . During this college football bowl season, blimps will be all over the map. In addition to the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Goodyear's three airships are set to hover over Florida's Orange Bowl, California's Rose Bowl, Arizona's Fiesta Bowl, Louisiana's Sugar Bowl and the National Championship January 6 in Pasadena, California. Ever wonder what it's like up there in the gondola? Ever ponder the ""rules of the road"" when it comes to flying a huge aircraft close to skyscrapers and towering antennas? During the game broadcasts, how do the TV director, the pilot and the blimp camera operator coordinate to get those beautiful aerial skyline shots of the stadiums? Got a question for the crew? Share it in the comments section below and we'll try to get it answered. If the weather cooperates, the blimp will provide live beauty shots for ESPN's coverage of Duke University versus Texas A&M. On the field, 2012 Heisman winner Johnny Manziel -- aka Johnny Football -- will quarterback the Texas Aggies, while in the sky over the Georgia Dome, we'll go behind-the-scenes to reveal more details about what it takes to fly a true American icon. Meantime, here are a few pieces of blimp trivia: . 1. 'Everyone's looking up' How did Goodyear get into the airship business? In a word: rubber. Pretty much everybody knows Goodyear makes tires and other rubber products. In 1917, when the U.S. Navy needed airships that included rubberized fabrics and coatings, Goodyear came calling. The first Goodyear airships for the Navy were based along the East Coast and were used for training, patrols and search and rescue operations. Goodyear started operating its own airships in 1919. Little did Goodyear know its blimps would become one of the best-known corporate symbols in the United States. The company now estimates some 60 million Americans get a first-hand look at its three U.S. blimps every year. ""Sometimes you'll go over a high school or middle school that's having football practice and when we fly over, practice stops,"" says Lussier, captain of ""Spirit of Innovation,"" Goodyear's youngest airship. ""Everyone's looking up. It's kinda cool."" 2. Eyes in the sky . Goodyear kicked off its first blimp event coverage in 1955 at the Rose Bowl and parade in Pasadena, California, according to the tire maker. Nearly 60 years later, Goodyear performed another first: aerial TV coverage by two blimps simultaneously. It happened at a football game in November between Virginia Tech and the University of Miami at SunLife Stadium. ""In some ways, the Goodyear blimp is as much a part of football as tailgating or as hotdogs are to baseball,"" said 20-year veteran airship historian Dan Grossman. ""You can imagine football without it, but it would be kind of sad. It has become part of our national consciousness."" 3. Dude, Zeppelins ROCK! Beginning in 2014, Goodyear plans to start phasing out its blimps to make room for a new generation of airships: the Zeppelin NTs. The envelopes of the NTs have semi-rigid internal frames made of lightweight carbon fiber. So, technically, these new Goodyear airships won't be blimps. Hmmmm... will folks start calling them ""Goodyear semi-rigid airships?"" Doubtful. In fact, Goodyear calls them NTs, which stands for ""new technology."" The company is building them in partnership with German manufacturer ZLT Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik. That's the forerunner of the firm that built the infamous airship the Hindenburg, which blew up during a New Jersey landing in 1937. Unlike that Zeppelin, NTs fly with helium, not the dangerously flammable hydrogen that destroyed the Hindenburg. The NTs will be more than 50 feet longer, 20 mph faster and more maneuverable than Goodyear's blimps. ""It'll carry more passengers,"" says Lussier. ""And the two engines attached to a frame midway up the envelope will swivel, allowing it to take off and land more like a helicopter in tighter spots. And on top of that, the new airship's going to be a lot faster."" As previously mentioned, the blimps max out at around 53 mph, while the Zeppelins are expected to top out at around 70 mph. ""Its abilities are just phenomenal,"" Lussier says. 4. Auto-deflate mechanism . Even when they're on the ground, the blimps are extremely vulnerable to high winds. A special latch on the nose of the blimps keeps it attached to a mast. Goodyear says failure of that latch is very unlikely, but if the blimp does break away from the mast, it's designed to automatically deflate to prevent it from floating away. 5. Razzle-dazzle . Next time you see breathtaking video above a sports stadium from a Goodyear Blimp, think about this: video beams from the airship to the ground via microwaves are sent to a microwave dish and a receiver, which then feeds video to the TV network. Goodyear uses its own camera operators and specially designed TV equipment to shoot those beauty shots. Thousands of LED lights across the surface of the blimps create a bit of razzle-dazzle signage. The company calls it Eaglevision, describing it as a ""computer driven, electronic system which reads data and then sends out millions of commands to turn the lights on and off with different colors at the proper instant creating text and animations brilliant enough to be seen up to one mile away.""","Goodyear began making blimps in 1917 .

"(CNN) -- Atlanta's airport and airlines there continue to bear the brunt of this week's snowfall that paralyzed parts of the South as their employees struggle to get to work Thursday at the world's busiest airport. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport had nearly 500 flight cancellations by noon ET, according to FlightAware.com. Flight operations are usually back to nearly normal volume one or two days after such a weather event, said FlightAware.com's Mark Duell, barring any exceptional circumstances. ""The disruption to passengers is typically longer, but depends on the mix of passengers canceling their plans versus rebooking at a later date,"" he said via e-mail. Cold temperatures and icy roads are preventing some airport and airline personnel from getting to the Atlanta airport. ""Some Delta employees and other people (responsible for aircraft security sweeps and cleaning aircraft) are having trouble getting to work on time,"" said Delta Air Lines spokesman Morgan Durrant. Delta canceled some 440 flights before noon Thursday, on top of about 1,500 canceled flights Wednesday. As temperatures warm up Thursday afternoon in Atlanta and the snow and ice melt, Durrant said he expects cancellations to drop. Southwest Airlines, whose Southwest and AirTran airline brands have a large presence in Atlanta, pre-emptively canceled nearly 120 flights systemwide by midday Thursday. ""We are focused on resuming operations in Atlanta right now,"" said Southwest spokesman Dan Landson via e-mail. ""Our operational planners are working with all (t)eams to ensure our operations can safely get underway."" Southwest and AirTran's travel waivers for certain cities expire Thursday. Travelers facing delays and cancellations receive waivers so they can change tickets without extra fees or higher prices. Delta's travel waiver will remain in effect through Friday, Durrant said. That's because the airline still anticipates a small number of cancellations, mostly on Delta Connection regional flights, on Friday.","Airline, airport employees struggle to return to work in Atlanta .

That's because the world's best Alpine racers are about to hurtle down the fastest downhill courses, tear up turns on the slalom, and grind through the super-G in pursuit of a dream far greater than a giant crystal globe and the overall title. So who is set to dominate next year on Sochi's world stage? Who will be peaking at just the right time at the Winter Olympics? And who is determined to etch their names into the history books? Here's CNN's guide to the seven skiers to keep an eye on over the coming months. Lindsey Vonn . Last year we all watched with disbelief as the American ski star's season dramatically unraveled. The 28-year-old Vonn had started the Alpine season chasing Annemarie Moser-Proll's record number of World Cup victories, after making a promising start with wins in Lake Louise. In December her confidence was at such a high that she even spoke to CNN at the time about gutsy plans to legally contest the sports governing body, so that she might have the opportunity to race against the men. Such optimism proved short lived. A stomach illness forced her to take a three-week absence from the circuit in January, during which she admitted to suffering with depression. She returned just in time for the World Championships in Schladming only to suffer a horrific fall in the super-G during her first race of the competition. Airlifted to hospital, many thought her season and chances of making the Olympics were over. Vonn had hoped to be back for the new World Cup ski season, which begins in the Austrian resort of Soelden this weekend, but the Olympic gold medalist and four time overall world champion will not be able to take part as she continues her comeback from a serious knee injury. ""I will go home to Vail and continue my preparation for the Beaver Creek races and my ultimate goal in February!"" she said on her website earlier this week. Her ultimate goal in February is, of course, gold in Sochi. Bode Miller . An Alpine season without Bode Miller always feels a little flat, but next month the U.S. skier who is loved by fans and loathed by coaches -- for his antics on and off-piste -- will be back from injury with his eyes firmly on the Olympic podium. Despite his reputation for his love of the good life, Miller has earned his pedigree as an incredible athlete and competitor after career wins of five Olympic medals, five World Championships and two overall titles. In November 2012 a persistent knee injury put him out of competition for the entire season and he's been undergoing rehabilitation over the last year to be race fit for Sochi. Ski fans are likely to see a different Bode this season. Weighing some nine kilos lighter than in recent years, his troublesome knee is back in shape and he's spoken out about how we won't be the go-for-broke skier of his youth. At 35, he'll be the oldest U.S. Alpine skier to compete in the Olympics and if he wins, he'll be the oldest Olympic champion in Alpine skiing. A tall order, but no doubt Miller will want to go out with a bang. Tina Maze . If Maze's form is even half as good as it was in the 2013-14 season, we'll surely be seeing this Slovenian medal in Sochi. In April she ended the year as the world's No. 1 female skier, wiping the board as the overall World Cup champion with 11 victories and a record 2414 points. Even before Lindsey Vonn's injury at the World Championships in Schladming, Maze had emerged as the American's toughest adversary in years, and now we'll have the chance to see the world's two best female skiers compete for the first time on an Olympic platform. There's reportedly no love lost between the two off-piste either - so expect some fireworks. Mikaela Shiffrin . Teen sensation Shiffrin blasted onto the scene last season to become the youngest World Cup slalom champion since 1974. She's been dubbed a ""mini-Lindsey"" due to the fact that she hails from the same town -- Vail, Colorado -- and also been labeled an American sweetheart. But beware Shiffrin is a fierce competitor. And if she can handle the hype, a slalom gold is a strong possibility in Sochi. Aksel Lund Svindal . Like Norwegian wood, Svindal is big, strong and heavy. Hardly surprising then that his best performance should be in the speed disciplines super-G and downhill, which are best suited to strong, endurance skiers. After taking the World Cup titles in both last season, he'll be sizing up the course in Sochi which has been generating buzz for the sheer size of its jumps and long, hard terrain -- a suitable gauntlet for this Norwegian pillar. Marcel Hirscher . There is something of the ""Terminator"" about Marcel Hirscher -- and not just because he's a muscly Austrian. Hirscher's skiing has always been clinical, technical and deadly to opponents which he proved once again when he took the overall world title last season for the second time in his career. He maintained a run of 18 podium appearances in 19 races in the two technical events -- slalom and giant slalom -- matching the legendary Alberto Tomba's record in the process. Ted Ligety . To say Ligety's 2013 season was a breakthrough year would be an understatement. At the season opener in Soelden the 31-year-old American set the tone winning by a record breaking 2.75 second margin in the giant slalom, and then went on to decimate all competition for the rest of the season winning all but two G.S. events on his way to becoming the World Cup champion. In the midst of this career peak, he also became the first man since Jean-Claude Killy in 1968 to take three gold medals at the World Championships . But can he do it again?","Skiing's World Cup's first event held this weekend at Soelden in Austria .

"(CNN) -- Gary David Goldberg, the writer and producer who created classic TV comedies ""Family Ties"" and ""Spin City,"" has died, CNN has confirmed. He was 68. According to Goldberg's son-in-law, Rob Dubbin, Goldberg passed away at his Montecito, California, home on June 22, just three days shy of what would've been his 69th birthday. The cause was a brain tumor. Goldberg, a Brooklyn native, collected seven Emmy nominations over the course of his career and won two of them. He picked up an outstanding drama series Emmy in 1979 for CBS' ""Lou Grant,"" and an outstanding writing in a comedy series Emmy for ""Family Ties"" in 1987. Goldberg contributed to ""M*A*S*H,"" ""The Tony Randall Show"" and ""The Bob Newhart Show"" during the '70s before taking inspiration from his life and the lives of his friends to create ""Family Ties."" The NBC sitcom, which became a defining series for the network during its seven season run from 1982 to 1989, centered on the cultural differences between a pair of liberal parents (Meredith Baxter and Michael Gross as Elyse and Steven Keaton) and their more conservative kids who were coming of age during the Reagan administration. A young Michael J. Fox had a breakout role as the Keatons' son, Alex. Justine Bateman and Tina Yothers played his sisters, Mallory and Jennifer, while Brian Bonsall later joined the series as younger brother Andy. Goldberg teamed up again with Fox in 1996 for the comedy ""Spin City,"" which Goldberg co-created with Bill Lawrence. Fox, now 52, said in a statement that it is with a ""full heart"" that he says ""goodbye to my mentor, benefactor, partner, second father and beloved friend, Gary David Goldberg. He touched so many with his enormous talent and generous spirit. He changed my life profoundly. Love to [his wife] Diana and all of Gary's family."" Actress Courteney Cox, who played Lauren Miller on ""Family Ties,"" also fondly remembers Goldberg as a supreme educator. ""My thoughts and prayers are with Gary David Goldberg's family,"" she tweeted Monday. ""A wonderful man who taught me so much."" Charlie Sheen, who worked with Goldberg on ""Spin City,"" echoed that gratitude in his tweet, calling Goldberg his ""sitcom mentor"" and a ""genius."" ""He's the sole reason I have a TV career,"" Sheen wrote. Goldberg, who also created the early '90s drama ""Brooklyn Bridge,"" worked in film as well. He wrote the screenplays for 1989's ""Dad,"" 1995's ""Bye Bye Love"" and 2005's ""Must Love Dogs,"" all of which he also produced. People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .

"(CNN) -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal rode into the Republican National Committee retreat in Charlotte, North Carolina, ready to offer a dose of tough medicine for the Republican Party, which he now says ""must stop being the stupid party."" ""The Republican Party does not need to change our principles,"" he said in a keynote speech, ""but we might need to change just about everything else we do."" Ouch. There's a problem with Jindal's prescription, however, rooted in an idea that Forrest Gump once articulated -- ""stupid is as stupid does."" As the GOP enters a period of reassessment, it knows it desperately needs to reach out beyond its older white male conservative populist base. Jindal is an appealing symbol of that needed change -- a young Southern governor who is also an Indian American and former Rhodes scholar. The GOP's problem in reaching out beyond its conservative base is not simply a matter of communication and tone. The problem is in the party's policies. But because Jindal needs to keep the conservative base in his corner to mount a widely expected 2016 presidential campaign, he is restrained from really dealing with the root of the problem. Some GOP-led states look at electoral vote changes . Instead, his well-written speech -- presented as a refutation of President Barack Obama's second inaugural address -- was incomplete and dominated by many of the straw-man arguments he decried. Defensively, Jindal assured his audience that his federalist vision of modernizing the Republican Party did not mean ""moderating"" its policies in any way. ""I am not one of those who believe we should moderate, equivocate or otherwise abandon our principles,"" Jindal said. ""This badly disappoints many of the liberals in the national media, of course. For them, real change means: supporting abortion on demand without apology, abandoning traditional marriage between one man and one woman, embracing government growth as the key to American success, agreeing to higher taxes every year to pay for government expansion, and endorsing the enlightened policies of European socialism."" The tragicomic caricature does not describe what Democrats believe or what a centrist Republican might want. But the markers Jindal puts down means he is backing social conservative positions such as opposition to same-sex marriage and the call for a constitutional ban on abortion that is codified in the party platform. Many voters -- especially members of the millennial generation -- consider these positions at odds with libertarians' professed belief in maximizing individual freedom, but the contradiction and resulting voter alienation is entirely sidestepped. Confronting it is politically inconvenient, if not impossible. Not being the stupid party also means supporting science and the separation of church and state, at least to the extent that creationism is not taught in public schools. But Jindal has backed the teaching of creationism in Louisiana public schools in a pander to conservative populists. Physician, heal thyself. When Jindal says, ""We must not become the party of austerity. We must become the party of growth,"" he is arguing for a positive frame for the conservative message. But he is not actually questioning conservatives' call to cut federal spending and social programs dramatically, which could restrict growth and alienate efforts to appeal beyond the base. He's just saying the GOP should present the glass as half full. I'm all for reinventing government and reducing bureaucracy dramatically -- as Jindal calls for -- but part of ""talking to Americans like adults"" -- involves talking about the real costs and consequences, not just reframing the debate. Jindal rightly says, ""We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments. We've had enough of that."" He's presumably referring to the self-destructed tea-evangelist Senate campaigns of Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin -- which alienated women and centrist voters with the candidates' tortured talk about rape, biology and abortion. But the problem with those bizarre and offensive comments was rooted in the policies the Senate candidates were being asked to defend -- namely, their faith-based opposition to abortion, even in cases of rape. Unless, that policy is addressed, the problem will remain. Silence on the subject doesn't solving anything. Analysis: Jindal lays down 2016 marker . Likewise, correcting the overwhelmingly white complexion of the conservative base will require more than just talking to everyone as individuals and rejecting identity politics. It will require backing policies such as comprehensive immigration reform -- as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have backed. Jindal stayed silent on the subject and substance. There is a lot to admire in Jindal's speech -- first and foremost the courage it took to challenge his party in unvarnished terms so soon after a stinging election loss. He is right about the need to offer a compelling contrast rooted in radical simplification to decrease costs and increase efficiency. Jindal is correct in saying that Mitt Romney's failure was in large part his inability to move beyond simply criticizing Obama and offer a detailed positive policy alternative. But that failure was rooted in the fact that much of current conservative policy is broadly unpopular, a problem only compounded when the party becomes more polarized and dominated by the far-right debating society. The demonization of Obama beyond all reason and reality only adds to the credibility gap that conservatives are now confronting. Most leading national Democrats -- whether it is Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton or John Kerry -- may be decidedly center-left, but they are basically pragmatic progressives, not the kind of fuming anti-American statists many conservatives imagine. Most Main Street Americans understand this, and hard-core conservatives look a bit dotty for insisting their overheated vision is rooted in reality. There's one final contradiction between rhetoric and reality that's worth confronting. Jindal spent a lot of time in his speech slamming the ""barren concrete"" of Washington and the job of ""managing government."" But if Jindal runs for president -- as seems increasingly likely -- he'll be running for the privilege of living in that barren concrete jungle and managing the federal government. That's a basic part of the job description. Let's be honest: Jindal doesn't really hate the federal government; he wants to run it. Jindal is courageous to call on his party to stop being ""the stupid party."" But that slogan and his speech is a diagnosis of the problem, not a prescription for fixing it. Confronting the impulse to pander to social conservative populists is necessary to fix ""the stupid party."" The problem is in the policy, not just political perception. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal advocates that GOP reach out beyond base .
John Avlon: Jindal is not dealing with the root of the problem, which is GOP policies .
Saying GOP must stop being ""the stupid party"" is a diagnosis but not a prescription, Avlon says .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Bob and Debbie Burns endured three dark and powerless days after Hurricane Sandy. When the lights went out this time -- the result of a powerful winter storm-- they were ready. Candles give a pleasant glow to their living room in Abington Township, Pennsylvania, a Philadelphia suburb. Burning logs in the fireplace give at least a little warmth. They have hot water, and a gas stove to cook on -- both products of their experience in the wake of Sandy -- the 2012 hurricane that caused widespread damage and power outages up and down the Eastern Seaboard. And they huddle under blankets and pass the time talking. ""We're very content,"" Bob Burns told CNN on Wednesday night. ""It gives us more quality time to sit and talk."" The couple are among an estimated 578,000 who remained without power early Thursday in the wake of Wednesday's snow and ice storm, according to a CNN tally of outage figures provided by electric utilities. In Philadelphia alone, electric provider PECO said that at the peak of the outages midday Wednesday, more than 623,000 homes and businesses were without power. That number had fallen to about 431,000 Thursday afternoon, according to the company. The vast majority should get their power back by Friday, but for some, the wait could stretch to Sunday, spokeswoman Debbie Yemenijian told CNN. After all, it's the second-most damaging storm in the company's history, PECO said. Crews from Arkansas, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio and Canada have joined PECO's workers to fix the damage, the company said. In all, more than 1,500 workers are in the field, it said. A similar number have been fielded in the Baltimore area, where some 45,000 homes and businesses remained without power early Thursday, utility Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. said on Twitter. Tens of thousands also remained without power elsewhere in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with a handful of outages remaining in Ohio as well. The storm that caused all the problems moved out of the Midwest on Wednesday, bringing more than 10 inches of snow to Boston, 13 inches to other parts of Massachusetts and 4 inches of snow and a quarter-inch of ice to New York. The wet, heavy snow was a delight for children who got a snow day, less so for everyone else. ""Harder to push, not as easy actually to plow,"" said Boston snowplow driver Nick Sfravara. ""It's definitely a challenge to get this stuff out of the way rather than the light stuff."" Another system is forecast to bring snow to the region this weekend, but it's not expected to produce as many problems, according to CNN meteorologists. The central United States will continue to deal with unusual cold, with wind chill warnings or advisories posted in more than a dozen states where highs are expected to be 20 to 40 degrees below average.

"MINGORA, Pakistan (CNN) -- Gen. Nadeem Ahmad swirls the helicopter over Pakistan's ground zero. Below is the Swat Valley of North West Frontier Province. A Pakistani soldier patrols a ruined street in Mingora. From the air, the valley in the foothills of the Hindu Kush looks undisturbed. Green fields amid clusters of drab houses. A closer look at Swat reveals how well the Pakistani Army fared in its military campaign to wipe out the militants. The cost of success: massive destruction that is sure to hamper the lives of already suffering residents just starting to trickle back to the homes they fled. A few months ago, ferocious battles between Pakistan's Army and Taliban fighters erupted here -- in Swat, Buner and Lower Dir districts. War's remnants serve as a constant reminder. A destroyed bridge. Pockmarked houses. Hotels that look like they've been abandoned for years. Nadeem maneuvers the chopper to circle Mingora, the largest city in the Swat Valley. From the hilltop Army sentry posts that come into view, soldiers survey the ground below, hard won from Taliban fighters. The militants, Nadeem says, have fled to nearby mountains. On the ground, he shows off a cache of weapons seized in the fighting. The soldiers are keen to boast their victory. Mingora remains on high alert. A curfew has been lifted for morning hours, although soldiers keep close watch on those who venture out. The city's pain is plainly evident on its scarred, deserted streets. Many shops are shuttered or destroyed.  Watch Stan Grant tour the shattered streets of Mingora » . The United Nations estimates that 375,000 Swat Valley residents fled their homes during the fighting. In all, 2.5 million Pakistanis were displaced in what was said to be one of the largest human migrations in recent history. About 260,000 people have been living in 21 refugee camps in neighboring Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Peshawar and Charssada districts, but the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees say the ""vast majority"" of internally displaced Pakistanis have been staying with host families, rented houses or in schools. The government plans to return people first from the camps and then focus on those living elsewhere. But this week, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) warned that as many as 1 million people could remain displaced until December because of the widespread destruction in their home towns, such as Mingora. Relief agencies have reported dire humanitarian conditions in Mingora: hospitals without electricity that are inundated with patients, an erratic supply of water and natural gas. One resident, who identified himself only as Abdullah, told CNN that returning people are facing shortages in food, water and basic supplies for survival. Some displaced families also expressed concerns about schooling for their children, reported the Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN), the U.N. news agency focusing on humanitarian issues. Louis-Georges Arsenault, emergency office director for UNICEF, said 1 million children were at risk of not starting school by September, mainly due to the Taliban's widespread destruction of schools and that 4,000 existing schools continue to shelter displaced people. Businessman Muhammad Khan, 40, who recently returned to Mingora, voiced the despair of returning residents. He told IRIN that ""everything is in ruins."" ""Everything is in ruins,"" IRIN quoted Khan as saying. ""It will take months for life to return to normality."" But that normality will no longer include the Taliban, Pakistani soldiers say. The fight was hard, but it was victorious, they say. They point to an area in the city where they say the Taliban displayed the bodies of their victims, some beheaded. It became known as ""Slaughter Square."" Slaughter Square's name may be outdated for the time being, but residents like Abdullah say it will be a long time before life in Mingora returns to what it once was. ""I don't like army. I don't like Taliban,"" Abdullah says, standing among the ruins of what used to be a thriving market. ""I only want peace.""","Pakistani forces in Swat Valley claim victory in fight against Taliban militants .

"NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN)  -- A quiet rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" capped an emotional candlelight vigil Monday night for slain Yale University student Annie Le, whose body was found on what was to have been her wedding day. Students at Yale attend a candlelight vigil for Annie Le Monday night. Several hundred people turned out on the Yale campus for the vigil, crying and hugging each other. Le's roommate, Natalie Powers, said the 24-year-old graduate student in pharmacology ""was as good a human being as you'd ever hope to meet."" ""She was also really tenacious and had a sense of humor that was never far away, and she was tougher than you'd think by just looking at her,"" Powers said. ""That this horrible tragedy happened at all is incomprehensible. But that it happened to her I think is infinitely more so. It seems completely senseless."" Connecticut state medical examiners announced Monday that the body found in a Yale medical research building over the weekend was that of Le, who had been missing for nearly a week. Her body was found Sunday hidden in a basement wall. Bloody clothes were found hidden above tiles in a drop ceiling elsewhere in the same building, investigators said. Le was last seen entering the building Tuesday morning. Thomas Kaplan, editor-in-chief of the Yale Daily News, said Le ""really had everything going for her."" ""She was a top scholar. She was very outgoing, a warm person,"" Kaplan said. ""You know, she was diminutive in stature, but certainly not in personality. And that's what I think just makes this so sad for everyone, regardless of whether you knew her. It's just a tragedy."" Le's death is being investigated as a homicide, but Connecticut medical examiners released no further information beyond the identification. A candlelight vigil in her honor was scheduled for Monday evening on the campus. A Yale professor said on Monday that the building has good security and only certain people can enter, let alone access certain areas. Professor Gary Rudnick, who interviewed Le when she applied for admission to the graduate program in pharmacology, said it gives him the sense that there could be a ""murderer among us."" No suspects are in custody, but investigators are questioning several people in the case, New Haven Police spokesman Joe Avery said.  Watch a report about the case » . Kaplan said Le's killing has left Yale students shocked and wary. ""Only Yalies had access to that basement, and that seems to point to someone in our community being involved in this,"" Kaplan said. ""That's what is so frightening."" Authorities have not described the clothes that were found, nor said to whom they may have belonged. Teams of investigators at a Connecticut State Police lab worked through the weekend processing and examining the blood-stained clothes. Kaplan said a Yale police official told the newspaper the clothes were not what Le was wearing when she entered the building. At a meeting Monday for members of the campus community, Yale officials discussed security and provided an update on the investigation. A faculty member and a student who attended the meeting told CNN that Yale officials said police have narrowed down suspects. Security cameras captured video of Le as she entered the four-story lab building at 10 Amistad Street, about 10 blocks from the main campus, six days ago. After poring over hours of surveillance tapes, authorities said they had not found images of her leaving the building. Rudnick described security in the building as ""very good."" It had restricted access, and simply having a Yale ID card was not enough to get in, he said. Within the building, one had to have special access to enter certain areas, he said. Le was to be married Sunday on New York's Long Island to Jonathan Widawsky, a graduate student at Columbia University. ""Annie has been planning this wedding for over a year with John, and she was very excited. She's been doing a countdown to her wedding day,"" Jennifer Simpson, a friend in Sacramento, told the CBS ""Early"" show. ""She was doing weather patterns to make sure that the weather would be perfect on her wedding day. She just wanted everything to be perfect, everything down to table napkins, to flowers. Annie was very, very excited about this day."" Investigators searched a waste facility Sunday that normally handles garbage from the Yale lab, said William Reiner of the FBI's New Haven office. The search took place at the Resources Recovery Authority landfill in Hartford, near New Haven. ""In a situation like this, it's common for us to follow the trash,"" Reiner said. Yale University President Richard Levin, in a statement to the campus community, said, ""Our hearts go out to Annie Le's family, fiancé and friends."" The school sent out information Monday from Vice President and Secretary Linda Lorimer saying, ""We are cooperating in all possible ways with the police to ensure they find every shred of physical evidence in the building so they can solve this horrible crime without delay. When the building does reopen, there will be extra security both inside and outside the facility for the foreseeable future."" Lorimer added, ""To augment the substantial security already in place at the Medical School, Yale moved last week to increase security and police patrols on the streets in the area and to add a new bicycle patrol. Yale also added security personnel inside Sterling Hall of Medicine, where Annie Le had her lab."" The school has made grief counselors available, as well as a 24-hour help line number. ""The university chaplain's office is available to offer pastoral counseling and can put members of the community in contact with those of many faiths and denominations,"" the message from Lorimer said. Le, a resident of Placerville, California, seemed to have been well aware of the risks of crime in a university town. In February, she compared crime and safety at Yale to other Ivy League schools for a piece for B magazine, published by the medical school. Among the tips she offered: Keep a minimum amount on your person. And she practiced what she preached, Simpson told the ""Early"" show. ""Annie always made sure she was safe,"" Simpson said. ""She doesn't walk around at night by herself. If she had to work late, she would make sure someone could come pick her up or walk with her."" When she walked over to the research building on Tuesday, she left her purse, credit cards and cell phone in her office. Vanessa Flores, Le's former roommate, wondered whether the magazine article had something to do with Le's death. ""The only thing I can possibly think of right now is maybe a psychopath, an antisocial person who -- I don't know -- maybe got upset about what she wrote about back in February about not being safe, and just kind of wanted to prove her wrong."" Le, originally from California, graduated from Union Mine High School in 2003, where she was named ""Best of the Best,"" and ""Most Likely To Be The Next Einstein."" ""She was very smart, well-rounded, liked by peers and very involved in school,""  high school principal Tony DeVille told CNN affiliate WFSB. Le set the bar high for herself, writing in her profile for the National Institutes of Health that she was interested in studying and researching regenerative medicine and hoped to remain working at at NIH or become a professor. Her friends remembered her as one of the nicest people they had ever met. Laurel Griffeath, a high school friend, told NBC's ""Today"" show in Le had a beaming personality matched with impressive intelligence, a girl who ""had it all."" ""Annie was just an amazing person, and I know that when tragedies happen, people always say that, but she truly was,"" Griffeath told the ""Today"" show. ""She was probably the most brilliant person I've ever met in my life, but what made her more amazing was that there was an intersection of intelligence and personality and ability and she worked hard and she was great with people and she cared about people and she was funny and she didn't sacrifice one part of her life for another like a lot of people kind of seem to. ""She just really kind of had it all. She was really amazing.""

"(CNN) -- It's one win for Darrell Wallace Jr., but what will it mean for other African-American race car drivers -- present and future? The answer to that question might not come for years. Nonetheless, NASCAR wasted no time Saturday in hailing Wallace's on-track success at Martinsville Speedway in southern Virginia. ""We congratulate Darrell Wallace Jr. on his first national series victory, one that will be remembered as a remarkable moment in our sport's history,"" said NASCAR chairman and CEO Brian France. Wallace took the Kroger 200 on the racing circuit's Camping World Truck Series, which is on NASCAR's third tier. Still, it is notable given that no African-American has won any NASCAR national series race since December 1, 1963, when Wendell Scott became the first ever to win a race at NASCAR's top level, in a victory at Speedway Park in Jacksonville, Florida. Scott, a Virginia native who served in the Army during World War II, raced in more than 500 races during his career -- finishing in the top five 20 times, though that would be his only victory. Plus, the 20-year-old Wallace isn't just any driver. He's a highly touted graduate of the NASCAR Drive for Diversity, having been featured in numerous local and national publications. The Mobile, Alabama, native -- who lives in Concord, North Carolina -- won in his 19th start on Camping World Truck circuit. In 10 of his first 18 starts, he finished in the top 10. Shortly after the Martinsville race ended, Wallace -- using his twitter handle @BubbaWallace -- reveled in the victory. He wrote: ""We Came. We Saw. We Conquered.""

"(CNN) -- Two weeks into the U.S. government shutdown and, days before a potential default, president Barack Obama has made a last ditch attempt to restore credibility to the world's largest economy. In nominating Janet Yellen to chair the mighty Federal Reserve, the president has tried to soothe markets already roiled by Washington D.C.'s bickering. Do investors care whether Yellen is a woman? ""Of course not,"" I hear you cry. What they care about is whether she will print more, cheap money and keep rates low. WATCH MORE: The most powerful woman you've never heard of . But aside from her immediate leanings on quantitative easing, Yellen's nomination is an important milestone for female representation in the world of monetary policy. Why? Because for the first time a woman is being entrusted with the value of not just any currency but the world's most important reserve and trading currency. Her actions will touch the lives of millions at home and abroad, giving patriarchal societies pause for thought. READ MORE: Horrible way to fill one of world's most powerful jobs . Women may not be allowed to vote in Saudi Arabia, for instance, but the country's main export -- oil -- is priced in dollars. Men may dominate the financial sector but for the next four years they will have to hang on a woman's every word. Yet as influential as she may be, Yellen cuts a lonely figure in the global organogram of central banks, especially in Europe, where both the ECB and the Bank of England are currently bereft of girl power at the top of the tree. A cursory glance at the Central Bank Directory shows just 12 of the world's 160 central banks had female governors last year. That's about 6%.

"(CNN) -- For over half a century, Formula One has been a man's game. But maybe no more as the sport's glass ceiling suffered a further fracture on Wednesday. Monisha Kaltenborn became the sport's first female team principal when she was handed the reins at Sauber in October and now Williams has followed suit after appointing Claire Williams to a similar key role. The daughter of team founder Frank Williams, the 36-year-old will work alongside her father as deputy team principal. The British team is the only constructor which currently employs a female driver with Susie Wolff testing for the marque. ""I'm truly honored to be taking on the role of deputy team principal and look forward to working alongside Frank to help run the team this season and beyond,"" Claire told Williams' official website. ""I have grown up in the sport and have learned the ropes from one of Formula One's legendary team principals and as a result I feel well equipped for this new challenge. ""I understand the commitment that every person within the team gives each day to see our car out on the track and I am determined to see us back at the top."" Williams are one of the most successful teams in F1 history, winning nine constructors' championships and seven drivers' titles since making their debut at the 1978 Argentine Grand Prix. But in recent times the team has floundered, although Venezuelan driver Pastor Maldonado did pick up Williams' first race win since 2004 at last year's Spanish Grand Prix. Frank Williams, who is tetraplegic and has been confined to a wheelchair since a car accident in 1986, is confident the future of the team is in safe hands. ""Over the past decade Claire has worked tirelessly for Williams,"" said the 70-year-old. ""Her knowledge of the sport and passion for the team is unquestionable and I'm proud to say that during her time here she has proven herself to be one of our most valuable assets. ""With Claire being appointed Deputy Team Principal, I know the future of Williams is in extremely safe hands. ""This appointment also had Ginny's blessing who I know would have been incredibly proud to have seen Claire taking on this position by my side,"" added Williams, referring to his wife Virginia, who died earlier this month of cancer.

"(CNN) -- NASCAR driver Trevor Bayne has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, according to his racing team. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system, often causing pain, numbness in the limbs and a loss of vision. Symptoms vary by patient and can disappear for months at a time, making it difficult to diagnose early on. Doctors have cleared Bayne, 22, to compete, said a statement by Roush Fenway Racing. ""I am in the best shape I've ever been in, and I feel good,"" Bayne said. ""There are currently no symptoms and I'm committed to continuing to take the best care of my body as possible."" Bayne was the youngest driver in NASCAR history to win the Daytona 500 in 2011. He said he plans to race in the NASCAR Nationwide Series Championship in 2014. Daytona 500 fast facts . Scientists do not know what causes multiple sclerosis, according to the Mayo Clinic, although a person's risk increases if a family member has the disease. Women are more likely than men to develop the disease, and it affects Caucasians more than other ethnic groups. More than 2.3 million people worldwide have been diagnosed, according to the National MS Society. With MS, the body's immune system destroys a fatty substance called myelin that protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. This causes communication problems between the brain and body, according to the Mayo Clinic, and may damage the nerves permanently. There is currently no cure for MS. Doctors focus treatment on managing the patient's symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease with medication, physical therapy and an overall healthy lifestyle, such as getting plenty of sleep and eating right. Stress can trigger MS symptoms, so patients often do yoga or meditate to relieve anxiety. As the disease progresses, patients may experience extreme fatigue, balance problems and muscle weakness. Occasionally MS will lead to partial or full paralysis. It is not normally fatal; most patients with MS have ""a normal or near-normal life expectancy,"" the National MS Society says.","Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. ""30 rock"" actors Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski, Jack McBrayer, Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan. After a long day's work, workers often look forward to a relaxing evening at home, enjoying their favorite TV shows to escape the chaos that they (hopefully) left at the office. But what happens when the workplace follows us into the TV? These days, more and more shows are set in work environments, making it easier for viewers to relate to realistic characters and storylines. In a recent CareerBuilder survey, when asked which TV show reminds them of their work environment, 15 percent of workers said ""The Office."" ""Deadliest Catch,"" ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Lost"" trailed with 3 percent each, and ""CSI,"" ""Rescue Me"" and ""Ugly Betty"" followed with 2 percent each, respectively. Here are some of our favorite TV workplaces and why: . 1. ""30 Rock"" Work environment: TV network Why we love it: Because it's entertaining (to say the least). Summary: Set behind-the-scenes of a fictional, live sketch-comedy show, its characters are beyond hysterical. Between Kenneth, the overeager, quirky, entry-level studio page; Jenna, the conceited, flirtatious and often flighty actress; and Tracy, the unpredictable, self-centered and ""crazy movie star,"" we barely have time to focus on Jack Donaghy, the interfering network executive and Liz Lemon, the narrator and head writer for the show. 2. ""The Cleaner"" Work environment: Drug intervention Why we love it: Because it's inspirational to workers and people everywhere. Summary: William Banks, an extreme interventionist, is inspiring in his passion and dedication for his work, referring to it not as a job, but as a calling. ""The Cleaner"" focuses on Banks and his small team, all of whom are recovering addicts. Together, they use unconventional, often extreme measures ""by any means necessary"" to get rock-bottom addicts on the road to recovery. 3. ""Glee"" Work environment: Secondary education Why we love it: Because it portrays the ups and downs of what it takes to be a great educator. Summary: Will Schuester is an optimistic teacher who takes on the difficult task of restoring the formerly awesome glee club. Despite opposition from his co-workers (specifically, the hilarious gym teacher), Schuester demonstrates that with a little determination, even the toughest tasks at work can be handled. 4. ""HawthoRNe"" Work environment: Hospital Why we love it: Because it teaches workers to stand up for themselves and others at work. Summary: Whether she's your boss, your colleague or your nurse, chief nursing officer Christina Hawthorne encourages workers everywhere to make a difference. Compassionate and headstrong, Hawthorne fights for her patients to the death (no pun intended), defends her staff and stands up to authority if necessary. 5. ""In Treatment"" Work environment: Psychotherapy practice Why we love it: Because it touches on an industry that isn't always talked about, but has become a staple of American society. Summary: A show about a psychotherapist (and his psychotherapist), the drama captures Dr. Paul Weston and his sessions with his patients. We think it gives the oft-unrecognized psychotherapist some well-deserved credit. 6. ""Lie to Me"" Work environment: Various Why we love it: Because it's unique, honest and contributes to the greater good. Summary: If your boss is Dr. Cal Lightman, you can forget about feeding him a line about your alarm clock not going off this morning. Lightman is the world's leading deception expert and can detect the truth by analyzing a person's body language, facial expressions, voice intonations and speech patterns. (Talk about an intimidating boss.) Lightman and his team help federal law enforcement, government agencies and local police with their most difficult cases. 7. ""The Listener"" Work environment: Paramedics Why we love it: Because it focuses on a (cute) 25-year-old paramedic who can read people's minds, and therefore, solves crimes. How's that for good qualities in a co-worker? Summary: Toby Logan can listen to anyone's most intimate thoughts, a secret he shares with only one other person. He tries to use his gift to help as many people has he can, personally and professionally, but struggles with his own inner demons. 8. ""Parks and Recreation"" Work environment: Local government, specifically the parks and recreation department Why we love it: Because everyone can relate to a character on this show as it pokes fun at how seriously -- or in some cases, lightly -- some people take their jobs. Summary: Documentary cameras follow Leslie Knope, mid-level government official, as she tries to advance her career by helping turn an abandoned construction pit into a community park with no thanks to one colleague who ""cheerfully exploits his government position for personal gain,"" and her boss, ""who is philosophically opposed to government in any form."" If nothing else, this workplace is pure comedy. 9. ""Rescue Me"" Work environment: New York City firehouse Why we love it: Because it pulls on our heartstrings watching the camaraderie and relationships among colleagues. Summary: Focusing on the men in a New York City firehouse -- the crew of the fictional Firehouse 62 -- the show mainly follows Tommy Gavin, a veteran firefighter and relapsed alcoholic. We also get a peek into the lives of his crew, and the day-to-day struggles firefighters face personally and professionally every day. 10. ""True Blood"" Work environment: Local diner/small town Why we love it: Because of its character storylines -- especially the cute vampire coupled with a telepathic waitress. Summary: Realistically, this ""workplace"" isn't realistic at all, what with the selling and dealing of vampire and synthetic blood; anti-vampire movements and the general idea of the co-existence of humans and vampires.

"KUPANG, Indonesia (CNN)  -- At Roslin Orphanage, children giggle through deep concentration as they try to master the ""Chicken Dance."" It's a far cry from the Indonesian orphans' earlier months and years. Budi Soehardi poses with young residents of Roslin Orphanage. ""They are cheerful-looking and photogenic, but close to all have a very sad story,"" said Budi Soehardi, founder of the West Timor orphanage. ""Some of the babies come because a mother passes away right after delivery because of lack of nutrition. Others come from extreme poverty. Some come from families [that] just do not want the children and abandon them,"" he said. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . Soehardi, a 53-year-old Indonesian pilot living in Singapore, and his wife, Peggy, look after 47 children at the orphanage. They have a personal relationship with each one, and consider them part of their family. The couple named many of the children since they entered the orphanage as babies -- some of them tiny victims and refugees from the conflict in East Timor. Soehardi has three children of his own but says there is no difference between what he supplies for his biological children and those living at the orphanage. They all get clean living spaces, vaccinations, food, clothing and vitamins from the United States. ""Mr. Budi is like my own father,"" said Gerson Mangi, 20, a resident at Roslin Orphanage. Mangi, who came to the orphanage when he was 12 years old, had no means to attend school after his parents died. Now, thanks to the educational training at Roslin and a private sponsor, he is in medical school. Soehardi, whose father died when he was 9 years old, can relate to these young people's hardships. ""Food was hard to come by and my school fee was very difficult,"" Soehardi said. ""The refugees just really strike me so badly and [I want] them to be better off."" Young victims of a fight for independence . A 1999 news report on the situation in East Timor inspired the Soehardis to take action. Soehardi was eating dinner and watching CNN with his wife and family at home in Singapore when he saw the plight of the refugees fleeing East Timor for West Timor, Indonesia. Families were living in cardboard boxes, children were wearing rags for clothes, and sanitation was nonexistent. ""It was devastating,"" Soehardi said. The poor conditions were a result of conflicts in East Timor that surfaced after the residents voted for independence from Indonesia. Following the election, militias -- with support from Indonesian security forces -- launched a campaign of violence throughout the region. Hundreds of East Timorese were killed, and as many as 250,000 were displaced from their homes, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Soehardis had been planning on taking a vacation, but watching the news made them rethink their plans. ""[My wife and I] look at each other and we have a thought of our own. ... 'Hey, let's do something else. Why don't we visit the place ... to make a different kind of holiday,' "" Soehardi said. He began coordinating financial donations, food, clothing and supplies. With help from friends and ground volunteers, the Soehardis navigated the conflict-ridden areas and delivered more than 40 tons of food, medical supplies and toiletries to East Timor refugee camps. Soon the Soehardis determined West Timor could use a space for orphans. ""My wife was initially asking me to build three rooms. Then two hours later she [asked for] five rooms, and then later nine rooms and finally, the orphanage building."" They completed their orphanage building in 11 months and named it Roslin Orphanage, after a pair of Timorese women whom Peggy looked up to as a girl. In April 2002, the orphanage opened and provided a home for four children. Since then the residence has expanded to provide free education, clothing, housing and food for 47 children of all ages, newborns to university-age. About half of its residents are younger than 8 years old.  Watch Soehardi teach the children the alphabet » . An unexpected harvest . The orphanage was built on donated land that the Soehardis initially thought bore barren soil. But today, the rice they feed the children comes solely from their own land. ""We dared to take the challenge,"" said Soehardi of his foray into irrigation. He and Peggy, who are not trained in agriculture, used two pumps and a generator to get water for irrigation. Then they began planting rice. ""One hundred days later, we were having our first harvest and declared ourselves to be self-sufficient on rice for the orphanage children,"" he said.  Watch Soehardi explain how he made the land more fertile » . It's a fortunate cost-cutting tactic, especially with Soehardi losing his piloting job in November because of the struggling economy. Soehardi, whose pilot salary goes toward maintaining the orphanage and funding medical student Mangi's education, is hopeful that the end of his contract will not affect the children's well-being. ""To help these children is a privilege for me and my wife because it's giving back to society ... giving back what has been blessed to us."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer arrives in London for the ATP World Tour Finals with a point to prove. The 17-time grand slam champion, arguably the greatest player to ever pick up a racket, is outside the top four of the world rankings for the first time in a decade. Drops in form and fitness have plagued the once all-conquering Swiss, but one prominent coach is confident Federer can return to the peak of the sport if he can address a niggling back problem. ""He's fighting against his back which is hurting him very often during the year,"" Patrick Mouratoglou, coach of women's tennis powerhouse Serena Williams, told CNN. ""He lost many matches because of the back, he lost confidence because of that and also he cannot practice the way he wants because his back is hurting. ""He's been out of shape too many times in the year and at that level you cannot perform when you are out of shape."" Federer, who recently split from coach Paul Annacone, is appearing in the season-ending showpiece for a record-equaling 12th year in a row. The Swiss has also won the tournament more times than any other player in history, with Federer heading to London's O2 Arena in search of a record-extending seventh title. Mouratoglou is confident Federer, currently down in seventh in the world rankings, still has what it takes to challenge the top players in the men's game. ""His back is the main thing,"" he added. ""I cannot say he would be No.1 still because the men are very close to each other. ""I think Rafael Nadal has always caused problems to Roger, but he would be in the top three."" World No. 1 Nadal tops the bill at the World Tour Finals and is bidding for a first win at the event, while six-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic is looking to add to the titles he clinched in 2008 and 2012. British fans will be disappointed that Andy Murray misses as he continues his recovery from a back injury, but 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro will be in attendance. David Ferrer, Tomas Berdych and Federer's compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka will also take part in the eight-man round robin competition. Frenchman Richard Gasquet completes the line-up.

"(CNN) -- It didn't take Maria Sharapova long to find a new coach. Two days after announcing she was ending her successful three-year partnership with Thomas Hogstedt, Sharapova said former great Jimmy Connors will be Hogstedt's successor. ""I have known Jimmy for many years and we briefly worked together in 2008 just before the Australian Open,"" Sharapova told her website. ""I am really excited about our new partnership and looking forward to the upcoming tournaments."" The coaching shuffle comes about two weeks after the U.S.-based Russian was upset by qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito in the second round at Wimbledon. ""Due to personal issues, (Hogstedt) was not able to travel in the near future and we both agreed it was the right time to move our separate ways,"" the world No. 2 had said. ""I am very thankful for all his work and wish him much success in the future."" Connors won eight grand slam titles. Like Sharapova, he was a steely competitor who never gave an inch. Some of his most memorable battles came against fellow American John McEnroe. Connors' backhand is regarded as one of the best ever. When his playing days were over, Connors kept a relatively low profile and mostly stayed away from tennis circles. That changed when he decided to work with a slumping Andy Roddick in 2006. The move paid instant dividends for Roddick, as he reached the U.S. Open final two months later. Their association lasted two years, with Roddick saying he resigned. Connors' autobiography was released earlier this year. It was under Hogstedt, a former touring pro from Sweden, that Sharapova completed her grand slam collection last year at the French Open. The victory was sweeter for Sharapova because it was her first grand slam title after a shoulder injury that derailed her career. She lost to Serena Williams in the final of this year's French. Sharapova's movement noticeably improved under Hogstedt -- adding to her fierce ground strokes and intense desire to win. But their last tournament together didn't go as planned, with Sharapova slipping twice on the grass at Wimbledon against Larcher de Brito and suffering her earliest grand slam exit in three years. The loss, however, allowed Sharapova to watch the end of boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov's marathon five-set loss to Grega Zemlja. Hogstedt left Li Na to work with Sharapova at the end of 2010, with the Chinese baseliner then reaching the final at the Australian Open while Sharapova crashed out in the fourth round. Li, the French Open winner in 2011, has the same agent as Sharapova in Max Eisenbud. Sharapova formerly worked with Michael Joyce and her father, Yuri. Earlier this week, another former No. 1, Ana Ivanovic, severed ties with Nigel Sears, the father of Andy Murray's girlfriend.","Maria Sharapova hires Jimmy Connors as new coach after splitting with Thomas Hogstedt .

"(CNN) -- The University of North Carolina has brought on a former U.S. attorney to conduct an independent investigation of academic irregularities at the Chapel Hill campus. Kenneth L. Wainstein, a 19-year veteran of the U.S. Justice Department, will have access to ""new information that may become available,"" UNC system President Tom Ross and UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Carol L. Folt said in a joint announcement Friday. The appointment of Wainstein by the university system comes amid increased national scrutiny on the matter. The institution has been under the microscope for two years, ever since the revelation that students -- mostly athletes -- were taking classes where little or no work was required. Renewed scrutiny came this year when CNN published findings from whistle-blower Mary Willingham that showed 8% of a sample of UNC students playing the money-making college sports of football and basketball were reading below a third-grade level. The announcement Friday said Wainstein will have access to information from local District Attorney Jim Woodall. The prosecutor has been investigating UNC's Department of African and Afro-American Studies -- the department where fake classes were uncovered. Late last year, the former head of that department was indicted on fraud charges related to those classes. ""Woodall has indicated that he will cooperate with the inquiry and that he can now share with the independent counsel as much information acquired by his office during the criminal investigation as determined to be appropriate,"" the joint statement said. The prestigious public university has repeatedly attacked the credibility of Willingham, but has also acknowledged shortcomings in its academics. ""I think that it is amazing,"" Willingham said when asked about the new outside investigation. ""... The truth has been available all this time. Truth is cheap, compared to whitewash and lies."" The UNC statement said Wainstein's finding will be made public. ""Based on information that the district attorney is able to offer, Wainstein will take any further steps necessary to address any questions left unanswered during previous reviews commissioned by the university,"" the UNC press release said. ""While there is no set timetable for completing the inquiry, the university will cooperate fully with Wainstein and ensure he has the full access he needs to complete his work. ...."" UNC has done several other internal investigations since The News & Observer newspaper first broke the story about the fake classes. Each time, the findings have raised more questions. Among them, the question of who came up with the idea for the fake classes, and how so many athletes were directed toward them. Initially, the university denied that athletics was tied to the scandal, and the NCAA declined to take any action against the university, saying it was an academic scandal, not an athletic one. Officials now appear to be backing away from that claim and leaving open the possibility that there was a stronger athletic tie. ""We have directed Mr. Wainstein to ask the tough questions,"" Folt said. ""Follow the facts wherever they lead, and get the job done.""","University hires independent counsel to look into irregularities .

"(CNN) -- Investigators are studying the camera that was on former world champion driver Michael Schumacher's ski helmet for clues to the cause of a skiing accident that left him critically injured in a French hospital. French media reports late Friday suggested police had seized the camera from Schumacher's family. It's not yet clear whether it was filming at the time of the accident. But his manager, Sabine Kehm, said in a statement Saturday that the family had handed the helmet camera over to the authorities voluntarily. ""That this should have been done against the wishes of the family is untrue,"" she said. Kehm said Schumacher's condition remains critical but stable. His doctors say no further update on his condition is expected before Monday, Kehm said. Schumacher suffered severe head trauma in the accident last Sunday in Meribel, in the French Alps. He is in a medically induced coma and has undergone two operations. Kehm said Tuesday that friends and family who were skiing with him say he hit a rock hidden under deep snow and was catapulted head first onto another rock. He was not moving fast at the time, she said. Friday was the former Formula 1 champion's 45th birthday, marked with a silent vigil by fans who gathered outside the hospital in the city of Grenoble where he is being treated. Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula 1 history, won 72 Grand Prix races between 1996 and 2006 for Ferrari. The automaker posted a message on its website Friday. ""This is a special day for Ferrari and all its fans, as it is Michael Schumacher's birthday,"" it said.

"(CNN) -- The fledgling International Premier Tennis League suffered a blow when two of the world's most recognized female athletes snubbed the event. Max Eisenbud, the agent of both Maria Sharapova and Li Na, told CNN on Thursday that neither would be appearing in the team tournament that is set to make its debut in Asia this November. Sharapova transcends tennis and has long been a magnet for sponsors -- the Russian is perennially listed as the world's richest female athlete by Forbes -- while China's Li is one of the marquee names in Asia, having captured a second grand slam title at the Australian Open in January. Li was ""confirmed"" as one of the entrants by the League in a press release last May. ""Maria and Li Na will not be participating,"" Eisenbud said in an email. Mahesh Bhupathi, a grand slam doubles winner and the main man behind the project modeled after cricket's highly successful Indian Premier League, will now be hoping he can secure the likes of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Roger Federer, the 17-time grand slam champion and still the biggest name in the sport, told Gulf News this week he generally backed the idea. The player list is expected to be revealed Friday. ""Firstly, I want to see whether it takes off or not,"" Federer told Gulf News. ""I know a lot of people have invested in it or are part of it. Anywhere where tennis grows is a good thing, so I hope it takes off and becomes very successful. ""In Asia, there is enormous potential (for tennis to grow), in places like China and India due to the amount of people that live there and the excitement they have for tennis."" The tournament sees five teams -- based in Mumbai, Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and another city yet to be officially revealed -- play each other over a roughly three-week period. Matches are contested over five sets but will employ no-ad scoring. One set is played in each of men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, mixed doubles and legends doubles. Optimism was initially high, with Boris Becker a founding partner of the league and Djokovic -- now coached by Becker -- calling it a ""revolutionary idea."" However, there have been delays in the player auction and the League was originally supposed to have six teams, not five. ""I think it will be great for tennis if it can be pulled off,"" said Eisenbud. ""I just don't see how it could ever work, but I hope I am wrong,"" he added without elaborating. A tennis insider who spoke on the condition of anonymity told CNN he didn't know if the TV revenue was in place to fund salaries and other costs. However, Peter Hutton, CEO of MP and Silva, the firm distributing television rights, said there has been ""considerable interest both in Asia and outside."" ""We've been waiting to see the selection of the franchise squads before finalizing any broadcast deals,"" he told CNN. ""Mahesh's personal credibility and his contacts within the world of tennis have made people sit up and take notice, and we believe that the 'made for tv' format is a good model on which to grow audiences for tennis worldwide."" Bhupathi didn't return an email seeking comment Thursday. Apart from who will show up, another question is: How can players complain about a long tennis year but then commit a chunk of the off-season to a tournament? Pros from the U.S. and Europe also face the prospect of making the long trip to Asia -- after completing the Asian chunk of the schedule weeks or a month before.","Maria Sharapova and Li Na won't be competing in the new IPTL, their agent says .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A Chinese court on Monday suspended the death sentence of Gu Kailai, the wife of a disgraced Communist Party leader, after finding her guilty of murder in the death of a British businessman, a court official said. Gu's death penalty has been suspended for two years due to her weakened mental capacity while committing the crime and her close cooperation with police during the investigation, according to Tang Yigan, deputy chief of Hefei Intermediate People's Court. ""I think this verdict is fair. It fully reflects the court's respect for law, reality and especially human life,"" Gu said in video from Monday's court session shown on state-run CCTV. Her sentence is likely be commuted to life imprisonment, if she doesn't commit any crimes during the two-year reprieve, as is customary in the Chinese legal system. Her punishment could be even further reduced for good behavior. She was jailed immediately following the verdict. Four police officers also were convicted of covering up the murder and received prison sentences ranging from five to eleven years, Tang said. Gu and a former household aide went on trial August 9 on charges of poisoning 41-year-old Neil Heywood. Murder trial at heart of Chinese political scandal . Near the end of that day's court proceedings, she said according to state-run news agency Xinhua that she ""accepted all the facts written in the indictment"" -- including poisoning the Brit at a time when she thought her son's life was in danger. At the time of Heywood's death last November, Gu's husband Bo Xilai was the head of the Communist party in the bustling southwestern city of Chongqing and an influential and controversial member of the Communist Party's politburo, the elite group of 25 men who run China. He is now awaiting his own fate after being stripped of his political office earlier this year due to an unspecified ""serious breach of party regulations."" Gu Kailai, the woman who had it all . Gu's aide, Zhang Xiaojun, also was found guilty Monday in Heywood's death and sentenced to nine years in prison, Tang said. The British Embassy in Beijing welcomed the Chinese investigation and the verdict. ""We consistently made clear to the Chinese authorities that we wanted to see the trials in this case conform to international human rights standards and for the death penalty not to be applied,"" said John Gallagher, an embassy spokesman. ""Our thoughts are with Mr. Heywood's family during this distressing time. Consular officials have attended the trial to fulfill our consular responsibilities to the family and our focus remains on offering them all the support we can."" Neither Gu nor Zhang will appeal their verdicts, according to the court. The verdicts were announced at the Hefei Intermediate People's Court in the eastern Chinese city where the trial occurred but about 1,250 kilometers (775 miles) east of the scene of the crime. The guilty verdicts were widely expected, as a U.S. State Department report noted -- citing the Chinese Supreme People's Court -- that Chinese prosecutors had a 99.9% conviction rate in 2010 in that nation's first and second levels of criminal courts. Chinese authorities had previously said that Gu and her son had ""conflicts"" with Heywood ""over economic interests"" and that she was motivated to kill the Briton because of fears for the safety of her son, Bo Guagua. Bo declined to comment on his mother's confession or ""any details pertaining to the case."" However, the day before the trial he told CNN he'd submitted a witness statement to her defense team. Prosecutors claimed Gu had invited Heywood to Chongqing -- the bustling southwestern Chinese city where her husband Bo was then Communist Party chief -- from Beijing. The two drank alcohol and tea in a hotel room, after which the British businessman got drunk and began vomiting, a prosecutor said. When Heywood asked for water, Gu asked Zhang, who'd been waiting outside, to come into the room. It was then that Gu got cyanide from Zhang and, after her aide carried Heywood to the bed, poured the poison into the Briton's mouth, according to the prosecutor. Gu then scattered capsules containing narcotics on the floor to make it seem like Heywood was using drugs, the prosecution said. She put a ""Do not disturb"" sign on Heywood's hotel room door and told hotel staff not to bother him, a hotel employee said. He was found dead on November 15, 2011, in the hotel room. Speaking at the end of court proceedings, Gu referred to her worries about her son. ""During those days last November, I suffered a mental breakdown after learning my son was in jeopardy,"" Gu, 53, said then. ""The tragedy, which was created by me, was not only extended to Neil, but also to several families."" Her alleged co-conspirator, Zhang, likewise admitted to a part in the crime and said he wanted to say ""sorry"" to the victim's family. ""I hope the court can give me a chance to take a new lease on life,"" Zhang said in the court in the eastern city of Hefei, according to Xinhua. ""I really know that I did wrong."" The verdict was announced as the future of Gu's husband, once a rising star in Chinese politics, remains in limbo. Bo, 63, had been widely expected to get into the Politburo's nine-member standing committee -- the country's supreme decision-making body -- later this year, when the Communist Party convenes for its once-in-a-decade leadership change. In the sprawling riverside megalopolis of Chongqing, the charismatic and urbane politician Bo launched a ""smash black, sing red"" campaign that promoted Chinese communist culture as zealously as it cracked down on organized crime. His economic policies, which included millions spent on social housing -- garnered him rock star status in Chongqing -- a fact that did not go down well with other members of the party hierarchy. His populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the economically liberal and reform-oriented faction within the Chinese Communist Party. Bo's world eventually came crashing down earlier this year when Wang Lijun, his handpicked former police chief, tried to defect to the U.S. consulate in the neighboring Sichuan city of Chengdu, triggering a political crisis that rocked the leadership in Beijing. Premier Wen Jiabao obliquely reprimanded Chongqing's leadership over the Wang incident during his annual press conference on March 14. Wen also referred to the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution -- a reference that alluded to Bo's red revival in Chongqing -- and said that the city's stellar economic performance had been the fruits of several administrations and not just Bo's work alone. The following day, Xinhua announced that Bo had been dismissed as Chongqing party chief and, almost a month later, he was suspended from the Communist party's Central Committee and its Politburo ahead of an investigation. He has not been seen in public since.","Four police officers are convicted of covering up the death .

"Chongqing, China (CNN) -- I glimpse the sprawling hotel from a distance, nestled into the lush hills on the outskirts of Chongqing. The air is fresher here, the temperature several degrees cooler than the sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million people below. In its heyday this was a high-end resort area but as we drive along the windy road towards it, I can see it is well past its prime. There are rundown buildings, dogs sprawl on the concrete and the smattering of restaurants, massage centers and karaoke bars clearly haven't had a facelift in decades. Last November, Neil Heywood, a British businessman with seemingly rare access to the rich and powerful in China, took this same journey. He would never return. His body was found in the Nanshan Lijing Holiday hotel, now the scene of a murder investigation. China enters internet 'battlefield' over Bo . Heywood is at the center of one of the most extraordinary, mysterious and scandalous stories in recent Chinese history. His death is the vital link in a chain of events that has seen a man once touted as a potential President of China purged from the Communist Party leadership, his wife investigated for murder, and his deputy in custody after he sought asylum at a United States Consulate. And it all started here, in this grimy, dilapidated hotel; a hotel my crew and I have now checked into. Other TV crews have been turned away at the gate, the traditional hand over the camera shot, but we've managed to find rooms. With key in hand I'm walking in the footsteps of Heywood. China promises thorough investigation into Bo scandal . It is a musty hotel corridor. There is a stale smell of damp carpet mixed with years of stale cigarette smoke. It's hardly the type of salubrious establishment befitting Heywood's high flying image. When I open the door -- the lock itself was jammed and took several tries -- the room is hardly an improvement. The furnishings are old and chipped -- a faded, flimsy lounge and a double bed with a garish purple and white vinyl bed head. There is a bug fighting for its life on the floor, skirting boards are busted and power points dislodged from the walls with exposed electrical wires. The air conditioning switch is old and faded yellow. When I switch it on the fan splutters before rattling to life. This is a hotel that has seen better days. The only decorations here are faded plastic flowers, and appropriately for this story, a jigsaw puzzle on the wall. At night mini-skirted call girls can be seen in the corridors furtively knocking on doors. I am reminded over and over again of how this seems such an unlikely setting for a baffling story that has captivated the country and thrown open the secretive doors of the all-powerful party. There are police everywhere. Patrol cars parked in the driveway, plain clothed investigators moving around the grounds. Oh to be a fly on the wall in the hotel staff rooms here, but publicly they will say nothing. Over lunch we tempt waitresses for any morsel of information, but they are well versed in keeping their mouths shut. ""There are lots of police here, what's happening?"" we ask. ""Nothing. They're just having lunch,"" one waitress replies before scurrying off the moment our plates hit the table. Yet behind closed doors this is all anyone is talking about. With each passing day more details are emerging of Heywood's business and personal links to one of China's most powerful families, and how it all allegedly went terribly wrong. Bo Xilai was the Communist Party Chief of Chongqing, a man who ruled this city with an iron fist. He made his name by driving out criminal gangs, sending underground heavies to jail. He presided over strong economic growth and did it all to a soundtrack of communist revolutionary-era songs broadcast on local television. To many locals, especially the poor we have spoken too, he was a hero. One shoe-shine lady told me he made the streets safer and the city greener. But to his critics he was an ambitious authoritarian who used his crime-busting campaign to target enemies and rivals. Now he's in disgrace, stripped of his titles and hidden from view. His former top cop and right-hand man, Wang Lijun, split from Bo and sought refuge in an American Consulate. Sources in the party now claim he'd argued with Bo after raising suspicions the Party boss' wife had a hand in Heywood's death. The investigation has yet to reveal its findings, but multiple diplomatic, business and political sources talk of Heywood's business and personal dealings with the Bo family. All the major players are dead or silenced. Dozens of people connected with the case have been arrested and Gu Kailai, Bo's wife, is under investigation for murder. I finally get one local man to talk. He doesn't condemn Bo. ""He should be remembered for the good things he did,"" he says. But like everyone he is fascinated by the twists and turns of this case. ""Bo Xilai is under investigation in Beijing,"" he says, ""Gu Kailai is his wife, she's involved in the death of that British man Neil Heywood,"" he tells me excitedly. As we walk the grounds of the hotel we get even closer to where it all began. Heywood was staying in what has been described as an upmarket villa in the complex. It has a price tag of $700 a night. If so it is greatly inflated. No one will say which exact villa it was and there is tight security, but we do manage to get inside one of the dozen or so two-story units attached to the hotel. Inside it is as tired and dated as the standard rooms -- the same faded furniture and stains on the walls. Yet the very state of this hotel, the sleaziness if you like, only lends to the fascination. What happened on the night Heywood died? What will this mean for Bo and his family? Right now the answers to these questions are locked behind these walls and we can only peer through the windows.","CNN's Stan Grant goes to Nanshan Lijing Holiday hotel in Chongqing .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The former Chinese police chief who attempted to defect to the United States, triggering one of China's biggest political scandals, has been jailed for 15 years. Wang Lijun, who was tried last week, was found guilty by the Chengdu City Intermediate People's Court of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking, court spokesman Yang Yuquan said Monday. Until he sought refuge at the U.S. Consulate in February, Wang was the right-hand man of disgraced Chongqing Party chief Bo Xilai, who was stripped of his titles in April because of an unspecified ""serious breach of party discipline."" Bo has not been seen in public since. Wang, 52, could have faced execution, since bribe-taking can carry the death penalty in China, depending on the amount involved and the seriousness of the case. Wang was accused in court of accepting bribes and property worth around 3.05 million yuan (around U.S. $480,000) for personal favors. He received nine years for this offense, with a further seven added for ""bending"" the law, two for defection and two years for abuse of power -- though the court decided on a ""combined"" term of 15 years, taking into account his cooperation with authorities, Yang told reporters. He was also stripped of his ""political rights"" for one year. Read more: Wang Lijun: the cop at the heart of Bo scandal . Wang didn't contest the charges, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency, which published details of the case. Wang has no plans to appeal the sentence, Yang said Monday. The case also brought to light the first suggestion that Bo knew as early as January that his wife, Gu Kailai, was suspected of murder. Read more: China's Bo Xilai 'implicated' in murder . After a one-day trial in August, Gu was found guilty of poisoning British businessman Neil Heywood in a hotel room in Chongqing last November. During her trial, she admitted pouring poison into his mouth, provided by a family aide who was also convicted of the crime. According to Xinhua, prosecutors said Wang knew ""perfectly well"" that Gu was suspected of murder, but deliberately covered up for her so she would not be held legally responsible for Heywood's death -- a fact that was repeated during Monday's court session, Yang said. Read more: Bo looms large over party leadership . The court was told that Wang later abandoned his efforts to conceal her crime when relations between the two became strained. Wang said in his confession that Gu ""turned hostile toward me, taking a different attitude from before when contacting me. She was not so warm as before and began to guard herself against me,"" Xinhua said. She was worried about her crime being exposed, and he was ""not pleased"" that Gu had told an increasing number of people about the incident. Read more: Gu Kailai, the woman who had it all . Then in late January, Wang told ""the then leading official of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Chongqing Committee"" -- the position Bo held -- that Gu was ""highly suspected"" of having murdered Heywood, Xinhua said. A witness, Guo Weiguo, testified that the official ""angrily rebuked"" Wang, before slapping him in the face. ""The conflict was made public after Wang Lijun was slapped,"" Guo said. After Wang's run-in with Bo, he instructed his staff to ""rearrange"" Heywood's case file. Shortly after, he was demoted and three members working closely with Wang were put under ""illegal investigation."" ""Wang felt he was in danger, giving rise to his idea to defect,"" Xinhua said. On February 6, Wang entered the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, where he said his life was in danger and asked officials to fill out an application for political asylum. The next day, however, he was persuaded to leave the consulate and was taken into custody by Chinese officials. In his final statement to the court, Wang was reported to have apologized for his crimes, saying, ""I hope the serious impacts (caused by my acts) both at home and abroad would be eliminated through the trial. Meanwhile, I hope the trial will issue a warning to society and let more people draw lessons from me. ""For the Party organizations, people and relatives that have cared for me, I want to say here, sincerely, 'I'm very, very sorry, I've let you down,' "" Wang added. At the close of the trial, Wang's defense team pleaded for leniency in sentencing on the defection charge on the grounds that Wang left the U.S. Consulate of his own volition. They also said he provided key evidence to help authorities secure Gu's conviction for murder and on that basis his crime of bending the law for personal gain ""could be lighter."" The court accepted these arguments and sentenced him ""leniently,"" Yang said Monday. Wang's decision to seek refuge in the U.S. Consulate brought the case into public view and led to Bo's high-profile demise. Until the case was exposed, Bo was considered a top contender for the Politburo Standing Committee, the team of nine politicians who effectively rule China. China's Communist Party is expected to meet at its 18th National Congress next month to announce who'll occupy the top positions. Bo, 63, was a charismatic, albeit controversial politician, who launched a ""smashing black, singing red"" campaign in Chongqing that promoted communist ideology and zealously cracked down on organized crime. His economic programs, which included millions spent on social welfare, made him a popular leader in Chongqing. But analysts say his populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the more economically liberal and reform-oriented faction that dominated the current party leadership. Bo and Wang were known to have worked closely on Bo's signature crime-fighting program in 2009. In just 10 months, Chongqing police arrested almost 5,000 people and executed more than a dozen.","Wang Lijun sentenced on charges including bribe-taking, defection, abuse of power .

"(CNN) -- Bo Xilai, the Chinese politician who fell from grace amid a dramatic political scandal, has been expelled from the Communist Party and relieved of his duties, China's state-run news agency, Xinhua, reported Friday. Bo once was considered a top contender for the Politburo Standing Committee, the team of nine politicians who effectively rule China, but the news report on his expulsion painted a portrait of corruption, abuse of power and improper sexual relationships. The party said Bo made ""severe mistakes"" in the killing of a British businessman -- a crime for which his wife was imprisoned -- and a diplomatic incident involving a police official, Xinhua said. Investigators cited influence peddling, bribery and womanizing, new details found in the course of the party's investigation. ""Bo had or maintained improper sexual relationships with a number of women,"" the state news agency said. He also took advantage of his power to seek profits and received bribes, Xinhua said. And his family ""accepted a huge amount of money and property from others,"" the news agency reported. The news came a month before China's Communist Party is expected to meet at its 18th National Congress in Beijing to announce who'll occupy the top positions. Bo Xilai saga nears end game . Bo is a charismatic, albeit controversial, politician who launched a ""smashing black, singing red"" campaign in the southwestern city of Chongqing that promoted Communist ideology and zealously cracked down on organized crime. His economic programs, which included millions spent on social welfare, made him a popular leader in Chongqing. But analysts say his populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the more economically liberal and reform-oriented faction that dominates the current party leadership. Bo's fortunes changed when news surfaced this year that his wife, Gu Kailai, was suspected to be an accomplice in a murder case. Gu and family aide Zhang Xiaojun were arrested in early April, suspected of poisoning British businessman Neil Heywood. Heywood died in November in Chongqing, where Bo was the Communist Party chief. His death was originally blamed on excessive alcohol consumption. Bo was soon stripped of his top posts for ""serious breach of discipline."" In August, his wife received a suspended death sentence after a seven-hour trial. Days later, four senior Chongqing police officers were also sentenced to jail for covering up the murder. Opinion: China murder trial a rigged spectacle . Why was Gu Kailai spared? Wang Lijun, the former police chief of Chongqing, set off the Bo story on February 6, when he fled to the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu and told American diplomats that Gu was a suspected accomplice in a murder case. After his request for asylum was turned down, Wang left the consulate and was taken away by Chinese officials. But his accusations rocked the world's most populous nation. Wang this week was sentenced to 15 years for defection, coverup, bribe taking and abuse of power. The party expelled Bo after an investigation of the killing and Wang's visit to the consulate, a trip made ""without permission,"" Xinhua said. The investigators said Bo ""bore major responsibility"" in the Wang incident and the killing, Xinhua reported, citing the investigation results. Bo Xilai 'implicated' in murder . Bo's fall from grace . ""He took advantage of his office to seek profits for others and received huge bribes personally and through his family. His position was also abused by his wife ... to seek profits for others and his family thereby accepted a huge amount of money and property from others,"" Xinhua said. Investigators determined that his behavior tarnished the party's reputation, Xinhua reported. The investigation discovered ""clues to his suspected involvement in other crimes."" The party investigators sent their conclusions to judicial authorities. ""Bo had affairs and maintained improper sexual relationships with a number of women. He was also found to have violated organizational and personnel disciplines and made wrong decisions in personnel promotion, which led to serious consequences."" The trials and convictions have been carefully scripted and apparently timed to ""deal"" with Bo ahead of the planned leadership transition at the Communist Party's 18th National Congress.

"CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee (CNN) -- An annual family boating trip to the Florida Keys took a bloody and life-changing turn for Jordan Thomas. Noah Parton, 6, got prosthetics from foundation started by Jordan Thomas, right. ""It was a beautiful day, and we were going to go scuba diving,"" said Thomas, who was 16 during the 2005 trip. But when he jumped into the water, the boat's wake dragged Thomas hard into sharp, whirling propellers. He immediately knew what was about to happen. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . ""I looked down -- my black fins were gone, and all I saw was red just everywhere,"" said Thomas, an athletic teen who was captain of his high school's golf team. ""But I had this unbelievable calmness over my body."" His father and mother, both doctors from Chattanooga, Tennessee, jumped into action. ""All of a sudden, my 16-year old, happy-go-lucky captain of the golf team was potentially dying,"" said Dr. Liz Kennedy-Thomas.  Watch Thomas tell his story » . She worked to stanch the blood flow from her son's legs while his father rushed the boat to shore and fetched paramedics. Thomas was rushed to a hospital, where he spent the next two weeks undergoing several surgeries on what was left of his legs and, along the way, discovering what would become his life's work. While there, Thomas visited other amputees. ""I just remember seeing so many kids who didn't have parents, didn't have health care,"" he said. ""I just knew that the future was grim for them."" The top-of-the-line prosthetics Thomas was fitted with -- the ones that helped him return to the golf links -- cost about $24,000. He learned that many insurance plans cover only about $5,000. That's especially tough on child amputees, who will outgrow several limbs before adulthood. ""I had no clue,"" he said. ""It's one of those things, unless you're affected by it, you just don't know."" Thomas knew he was lucky. With a financially stable family, he'll always be able to afford good legs. He asked his family to give a donation to help others, but ultimately, with their support, the teenager launched a fundraising foundation to provide life-changing prosthetics to children in need. ""By the time we got home, we had bracelets -- all kinds of stuff,"" Kennedy-Thomas said. ""The foundation was just sort of started by the time we got home."" The Jordan Thomas Foundation has raised more than $400,000 through bracelets, charity golf tournaments and cookouts. Some of that is paying for ongoing prosthetics for three children until they reach age 18. One of them is Noah Parton. The precocious 6-year-old was born with a congenital heart defect and had a complication with a tube inserted in his right leg, leading to an amputation above his knee. His family's insurance would pay only for a ""stubby,"" a wooden artificial leg without a bendable knee. ""His first bendable knee ... didn't have a certain number or something that would apply, and they refused to pay for it,"" said Noah's mother, Nancy Parton, who lives with her son about an hour north of Chattanooga, in Evensville, Tennessee. Noah couldn't run and play with other children. And even day-to-day activities were tough. ""It was hard to put him in the car because his leg stuck out straight. And I'd have my seat up as far as it would go, and it would still hit the back of the seat,"" she said. Thomas' foundation stepped in, buying Noah several knee devices -- a new one for each new leg he needs as he grows -- and a foot. ""He's so proud to show off how his knee bends,"" Thomas said. ""And his foot has a split toe so he can wear sandals like his parents.""  Watch Noah show off his bendable knee prosthetic to Thomas » . Now, his mom says, Noah is unstoppable. ""He loves to climb stairs now; he tries to ride bicycles,"" she said. ""You name it, he does it. ""Take him to the park [with] any other kid; he'll just blow you away."" While Thomas says his foundation still has a ""mom-and-pop"" feel, they plan to continue growing to help more children in need. ""If we provide them with prosthetics,"" said Thomas, ""then that creates a whole gambit of opportunity for them to achieve whatever they want ... and I think they deserve that."" As Congress debates overhauling the nation's health care system, prosthetics are quietly getting some attention. In May, Rep. Robert Andrews, a New Jersey Democrat, introduced the Prosthetic and Custom Orthotic Parity Act, which would require insurance companies to cover prosthetics at the same rate they do surgery. ""It's pretty simple,"" Andrews said. ""Prosthetic devices are not cosmetic. You can't walk without one or you can't lift something without one, and I think one of the reasons people are so upset about the health care system in this country is they had hassles like this."" Seventeen states have passed similar laws, most recently Missouri. But amputee advocates say there needs to be a national law. According to the Amputee Coalition of America, there are nearly 2 million amputees in the United States, and at least 25,000 of them are children. Kendra Calhoun, president and CEO of the coalition, said that with more sweeping health care legislation taking all the attention, ""our biggest hurdle [for a prosthetics law] right now is being heard."" Some insurance companies have said that premiums would go up for everyone if they were forced to cover prosthetics to the extent advocates want. Advocates cite a study that they say shows it would cost beneficiaries about five cents per month. Meanwhile, Thomas, a full-time college student in Charleston, South Carolina, spent the summer at home in Chattanooga working at a prosthetics and orthotics company. ""It is rewarding to actually make this stuff and work and then say, 'Now this guy's going to actually wear that,'"" he said. Thomas has no plans to slow down. He says he would like to become a voice for the amputee community and help many more children live ""normal and happy, productive lives."" ""When you're thrown into the situation, you just kind of adapt and you make the best of it,"" Thomas said. ""There's nothing that I really cannot do."" Want to get involved?

"London, England (CNN) -- Cherie Blair, the UK's former first lady, is a leading barrister who holds the senior advocate status of Queen's Counsel. In 2008, she founded the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, where she devotes herself to supporting female entrepreneurs in Africa, South Asia & the Middle East. She spoke with CNN's Leading Women team about her commitment to eradicating injustice for women, her rise from a working-class family and how she balances her charity work with her professional life. CNN: What achievement are you most proud of? Cherie Blair: Like every mother, it's my children, that's the first thing that makes me really proud. For my own part, it would be when I became a Queen's Counsel in 1995. I was the 76th woman ever to become a Queen's Counsel, so it was still a pretty rare thing. CNN: What cause are you most passionate about? CB: The thing I want to see before I die is women achieving full equality in the world. I'm very passionate about injustice against women and there's too much of it in the world. In so many parts of the world, women are not regarded as worthy or equal to men. In parts of the world women are bought and sold. We think that's just in the developing world, but women are bought and sold in our country, too. CNN: Who are you most inspired by? CB: My first inspiration was my own mother, who left school at 14 and started a career as an actress. Then my sister and I came along and my father abandoned her and she had to really pull herself up by the boot straps and work hard to support my sister and I. She was determined to make sure we got all the opportunities that she had been denied. CNN: How do you find the balance between your work as a barrister and your charity foundation? CB: It's always a difficult balance. There isn't a time or day when I don't think about both legal work and the Foundation. I've just come back from Nigeria where I was doing a legal presentation and at the same time I was also doing something with our projects in Nigeria. I'm very lucky that as a barrister I'm self-employed, so everything I do is on a project basis. I do this case and then another case, which allows me to mix and match. In theory that sounds very well planned and balanced, but in practice it's a little bit more chaotic and overlapping. If I'm doing a particular legal case, I have to concentrate on that, but I'm lucky that the Foundation has a fantastic CEO and 17 employees, so they are working on it day in, day out. I'm very lucky to be able to add to the fruits of their labor. CNN: How do you decide which causes to get involved with? CB: Sometimes my friends would tell me I'm very bad at saying no. These days I completely understand one has to have a focus and that's around women and girls, but that, of course, encompasses so many things. I'm Chancellor of the Asian University for Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, which is very much an education project. My own Foundation concentrates on women's economic empowerment on the basis that if women have their own money and are able to support themselves they can make choices about what happens to them in their lives, about whether they have education, whether they get married and what happens to their children. If they don't have financial independence and the means to support themselves, it's much more difficult for them to say no when people make them do things they don't want to do.

"(CNN) -- Jon Voight had screwed up. In the early '60s, when he was a struggling actor, he'd had a big, emotional scene in the TV drama ""Naked City."" By his own account, he fell short. He wanted to apologize to the casting director who'd helped him get the role, Marion Dougherty. He drafted letters. He imagined talking to her. He was embarrassed by the performance. ""I was so bad, I got almost physically sick watching it,"" he recalls in a new documentary, ""Casting By."" Several years later, he desperately wanted the lead role in a new John Schlesinger film, ""Midnight Cowboy."" But the casting director for ""Midnight Cowboy"" was Marion Dougherty. Voight flew to New York to meet with her. He showed up at her door and abjectly apologized. But Dougherty, always openhearted, was having none of it. ""Jon, that's the past,"" he remembered her saying. ""How would you like to meet John Schlesinger?"" Voight was nominated for an Oscar for the film, which was named 1969's best picture, and he was on his way. That's just one of many stories about the gracious and shrewd Dougherty, a casting pioneer, shared in ""Casting By."" The documentary about casting directors, which celebrates the contributions of this most neglected of Hollywood occupations, is scheduled to air on HBO Monday night. Dougherty, whose five-decade career started in TV's early days, gets particular attention. She is credited with revolutionizing the movie business by hiring many of the talents she saw in the New York acting world -- people such as Voight, Al Pacino, Glenn Close, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Diane Lane, John Travolta and Robert Redford. Her rise fortuitously coincided with the decline of the studio system, which swept away the contract players who were slotted into movies like so many items from a Chinese menu. She was also a mentor to a number of future casting directors, including Juliet Taylor (who has done more than three dozen films with Woody Allen, as well as ""Schindler's List,"" ""Working Girl"" and ""Network"") and Ellen Lewis (""Forrest Gump,"" ""The Birdcage"" and several Martin Scorsese pictures). ""(Doing the movie) opened a window for me into this world of casting that I'd never really been conscious of before,"" says ""Casting By"" director Tom Donahue in a phone interview. ""I didn't really understand the contributions of the casting director and how important they are creatively."" 'Everybody thinks they know how to cast' He isn't the only one. Though casting can make or break a movie, the job is often overlooked -- certainly by moviegoers, who may not be aware of the long process it takes to find the right actors for the right roles, and even by the movie business itself. Indeed, the casting director's film credit is ""casting by"" because the Directors Guild of America long prevented anyone else from being called a ""director"" on a movie. (The rule has been relaxed for cinematographers, often called ""directors of photography,"" and art directors.) ""It's not something that most people understand,"" says Marcia Ross, a veteran casting director whose credits include ""Oblivion,"" ""The Princess Diaries"" and ""Clueless."" (One of her former assistants, Kate Lacey, was a producer on ""Casting By."") ""There's a tendency in casting, because people know who actors are, that almost everybody thinks they know how to cast."" Casting, she says, means going through countless reels, submissions and auditions in search of filling movie roles; getting to know actors' representatives and schedules; establishing a rapport with the director; and, these days more than ever, being able to negotiate a Hollywood system in which many people have a stake in a movie's financial, as well as artistic, success. ""There's a lot of micromanagement and a lot of committee involvement,"" says Ross. ""It's harder than ever to get actors cast."" It's a conundrum: Producers may want an established name, while casting directors may see an unknown with real potential -- an unknown who won't get a chance until he becomes, well, an established name. And yet, she says, the job has real rewards -- particularly when those unknowns break through. It was a thrill Dougherty knew over and over, with her string of New York-trained performers. (Her secret? ""Gut reaction,"" she says in the film.) Ross, too, has given some actors their breakout roles, including Paul Rudd (""Clueless"") and Chris Pine (""The Princess Diaries 2""). When ""Diaries 2"" came along, Pine -- now known as ""Star Trek's"" Capt. James T. Kirk -- was ready to go back to New York after hacking around Hollywood for the occasional TV guest spot, says Ross. ""I was very taken with him, and I brought him in for (director) Garry Marshall and he was terrific,"" she recalls. ""But the thing with Chris was he'd never done a movie and nobody knew him. I think people were a little nervous. But I really believed in him, and I made a really good case for him, and he got the part."" 'Inside, Benjamin Braddock is short and Jewish' Casting is often inspired, a wonderful bit of serendipity. ""There's something magic in finding the right person for a part,"" says Ross. There are any number of examples. Redford was supposed to play Butch Cassidy in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" but thought he was more appropriate for Sundance -- and Dougherty backed him up. ""Casting By's"" Donahue says Clint Eastwood was actually considered for the lead in 1978's ""Superman,"" but Lynn Stalmaster -- another casting pioneer -- believed the role would be better served with an unknown, and went to bat for Christopher Reeve. And, in a classic bit of casting, Dustin Hoffman got the role of Benjamin Braddock in ""The Graduate."" In Charles Webb's novel, Braddock is an athletic, upper-class WASP -- someone who looks like Redford, who was actually considered for the role -- but Stalmaster and director Mike Nichols were looking for someone who could project the character's insecurity. In a ""Casting By"" clip, Hoffman remembers his uncertainty. ""I said to Nichols, I did not think I was right for the role. (Braddock is) kind of Anglo-Saxon, tall, slender, good-looking,"" Hoffman recalled. ""And he said, 'You're Jewish.' I said, 'That's right -- short and Jewish.' He said, 'Well, inside, Benjamin Braddock is short and Jewish.' "" Despite their key role in shaping movies, casting directors still don't get all the credit they deserve. That was literal in the beginning: Stalmaster was the first casting director to get ""single-card credit"" (in which the person is the only credit listed on the screen), for 1968's ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" Even today, there's still some resistance. Despite attempts to get the position recognized for Oscar consideration, the motion picture academy has yet to do so. (Moreover, when colleagues pushed Dougherty for honorary Oscar recognition, that attempt, too, failed.) Nevertheless, the actors have remembered. One of the pleasures of ""Casting By"" is watching performers who have long since gone on to fame and fortune become their younger selves -- telling stories about being hard-up for rent, scrapping for food, wondering about their next job, and then being blessed by a casting director's wand. Ross, who's been in casting for more than 30 years, says the idea of making and breaking careers doesn't enter her mind, however. She simply believes in what she does. ""I love talent,"" she says. ""The business has changed so much, but at the very core of it, my love of talent and helping them get the opportunity to work has not changed."" Dougherty, who died in 2011, felt the same way -- and the feeling was reciprocal: ""Casting By"" ends with a chorus of tributes from colleagues. She may not have been well-known, but Voight pays her a great compliment -- one due to so many casting directors. ""She could see what people couldn't see,"" he says.","""Casting By"" celebrates casting directors, especially pioneer Marion Dougherty .

"Beijing (CNN) -- As China looks to usher in its next generation of leaders, one of the messiest political scandals to hit the ruling Communist Party in years continues to fester. Two weeks after Gu Kailai was given a suspended death sentence in connection with the death of a British businessman, many are wondering: What will happen to her husband, Bo Xilai? Bo, 64, is a Communist Party ""princeling."" His father was a contemporary of Chairman Mao and Deng Xiaoping, and until recently Bo was a rising star in Chinese politics. He was already in the party's 25-member Politburo and was seen as a contender for the nine-member Standing Committee that runs China. But his political career unraveled abruptly when his wife, a lawyer and business consultant, was accused of murdering businessman Neil Heywood. Gu Kailai avoids execution . Gu's recent trial and conviction was swift. Although short in credibility, it has allowed Bo's political rivals to sideline him. He has been in detention since April after being removed from his post in the Politburo and as the Party chief in Chongqing, a sprawling city in southwest China of more than 30 million people. Curiously, Gu's trial avoided any connections between Bo and the murder. In fact, Bo's name was not even mentioned during the seven-hour trial. Murder trial at heart of Chinese political scandal . Analysts say Bo would probably escape criminal charges but is likely to be expelled from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). ""Getting expelled from the CCP is the nail in the coffin,"" said David Zweig, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Still, some analysts say Beijing is handling Bo with care. ""Excessively harsh treatment of Bo may cause a small earthquake in the political system because he is part of this network of princelings who also occupy important positions in the government and the military,"" said Wenfang Tang from the University of Iowa in the United States. Gu Kailai, the woman who had it all . The Bo affair has already sparked China's most serious political crisis in decades and has revealed fissures in the top echelons of the normally opaque Communist Party. ""(Bo) was definitely part of this factional warfare,"" said Geremie Barme, a Sinologist and author who teaches at the Australia National University. ""I think of Chinese factions as developing the moment somebody falls foul of the system."" This infighting comes ahead of the 18th Communist Party Congress. Bo Xilai's fall from grace . Much is at stake. The Congress, likely to be held in October, will announce the new lineup of leaders who will run China in the next decade. Jockeying for top positions is at final stage. Another hot issue is the size of the Standing Committee, currently a nine-member body that runs the country. Some reports say the new body might be pared down to seven members to make it more nimble and efficient -- and to drop from the elite body one slot reserved for the head of the Communist Party Central Commission on Political and Legal Affairs. This Leninist body manages China's police, judges, lawyers and courts nationwide. It is now headed by Zhou Yongkang, believed to be an ally of Bo. Bo and Gu on trial, in different ways . Other reports say it will remain a nine-member body to accommodate more representatives of the various factions. Just as contentious are debates over policies. ""I suspect the agenda of the Congress will include such issues as social welfare, energy, environment, inequality and anti-corruption,"" said Zweig. Ironically, they are some of the issues that Bo championed in Chongqing. ""Websites suggest Bo has public support ,but the new leadership can have 'Boism without Bo,' which means more housing for the poor, efforts to narrow inequality and fight corruption,"" Zweig added. Chinese media last week said the Party is launching yet another five-year plan to curb corruption. Lately the Chinese media have reported a slew of egregious graft cases. For example, Wang Guoqiang, the party chief of Fengcheng city in northeastern Liaoning province, has reportedly fled to the U.S. allegedly with a loot of over $31 million, while Chinese police have put on their wanted list a certain Feng Sun -- the president of a local bank in Jiangying, Jiangsu province -- who is believed to have fled to Thailand with this family with stolen assets worth millions of dollars. Small fry are easily caught. In Shaanxi province, a village party chief was recently sentenced to 12 years in prison for allegedly swindling friends and the local government of millions in public funds, including money allocated for road construction. ""Corruption is one of the top reasons for the public dissatisfaction with the government,"" said Tang. ""Clearly it hurts the very legitimacy of the CCP rule."" Yet, despite repeated campaigns, the CCP has failed to eliminate the scourge. One reason, China watchers say, is its sheer prevalence in and outside the Party. ""It's hard for a leader to stay clean when people find clever ways to bribe his or her spouse and other family members,"" Tang said. The Party faces the other challenge of managing people's expectations. ""Things are a lot better now, but certainly there are a lot of people who are not doing well,"" observed Mike Chinoy, a former CNN correspondent and now a senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S.-China Institute in Los Angeles. ""The party needs to figure out how to be more responsive to the people. They can't just rule by dictate."" That is no longer possible, Chinoy explained, because of the emergence of the Internet and social networking services such as China's Twitter-like service, Weibo. ""The party cannot just tell people what to do,"" he said. ""It's a much more interactive, back-and-forth process, so it's a brand new world for the party."" Adapting to the changing times, he added, will be the underlying theme of the upcoming Communist Party Congress.","Bo Xilai was a rising star in China's Communist Party before being removed from office .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For more than a year, Bo Xilai has been the elephant in the room in Chinese politics -- the central figure in one of the messiest political scandals to hit the ruling Communist Party in years. Sacked as party chief in the sprawling metropolis of Chongqing in March last year for ""serious disciplinary violations,"" the former member of the party's powerful 25-member Politburo has now been indicted for bribery, corruption and abuse of power, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Thursday. The 64 year old has been in detention since April 2012. The indictment paper was delivered to a court in Jinan in the eastern province of Shandong, Xinhua said, and paves the way for what will be the most eagerly anticipated trial in China in recent years -- an incredible story of elite politics, murder, intrigue and betrayal. According to the document, Bo, as a civil servant, took advantage of his position to seek profits for others and accepted an ""extremely large amount"" of money and properties in return. He also embezzled a huge amount of public money and abused his power, seriously harming the interests of the state and the people. The document added that Bo has been informed of his legal rights and interviewed by prosecutors. Political star . Bo is a Communist Party ""princeling."" His father was a contemporary of Chairman Mao and Deng Xiaoping, and until recently Bo was a rising star in Chinese political circles. A charismatic and urbane politician, he was credited with a spectacular -- albeit brutal -- crackdown on organized crime in Chongqing's massive municipality of around 30 million people. From June 2009, Bo led a law and order campaign that resulted in the arrest of thousands of suspected gangsters, but critics claim it also targeted his political adversaries. His economic policies, which included millions spent on social housing, garnered him rock star status in Chongqing -- a fact that did not go down well with other members of the party hierarchy. His populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the economically liberal and reform-oriented faction within the party. Wife woes . But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. consulate in the city of Chengdu in February last year and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was an accomplice in a murder case, a glittering political career began to unravel. In a turn of events worthy of a movie script, Gu and family aide Zhang Xiaojun were arrested in early April, suspected of poisoning British businessman and family friend Neil Heywood, who died at a Chongqing hotel in November 2011. Heywood's death was originally blamed on excessive alcohol consumption, but prosecutors claimed Gu and Heywood, who had been invited to Chongqing from Beijing, drank alcohol and tea in the hotel room, after which the businessman got drunk and began vomiting, a prosecutor said. When Heywood asked for water, Gu asked Zhang, who'd been waiting outside, to come into the room. It was then that Gu got cyanide from Zhang and, after her aide carried Heywood to the bed, poured the poison into the Briton's mouth, according to the prosecutor. Deputy's confession . At his own trial for abuses of power in September last year, Wang -- who was Chongqing's police chief -- was accused by prosecutors of knowing ""perfectly well"" that Gu was suspected of murder. They said he deliberately covered up for her so she would not be held legally responsible for Heywood's death. The court was then told that when relations between Wang and Gu began to break down over the issue, Wang told ""the then leading official of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Chongqing Committee"" -- the position Bo held -- that Gu was ""highly suspected"" of having murdered Heywood, Xinhua said. A witness, Guo Weiguo, testified that the official ""angrily rebuked"" Wang, before slapping him in the face. ""The conflict was made public after Wang Lijun was slapped,"" Guo said. After Wang's run-in with Bo, he instructed his staff to ""rearrange"" Heywood's case file. Shortly after, he was demoted and three members working closely with Wang were put under ""illegal investigation."" ""Wang felt he was in danger, giving rise to his idea to defect,"" Xinhua said. At the close of the trial, Wang's defense team pleaded for leniency in sentencing on the defection charge on the grounds that Wang left the U.S. Consulate of his own volition. They also said he provided key evidence to help authorities secure Gu's conviction for murder and on that basis his crime of bending the law for personal gain ""could be lighter."" The court accepted these arguments and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. During her trial the previous month, after which she received a suspended death sentence, Gu admitted poisoning Heywood, blaming a ""mental breakdown"" for her actions after learning that her son, Bo Guagua, was in jeopardy. According to Xinhua, Heywood allegedly threatened him following a botched business deal. Though Bo has yet to comment publicly on his wife's case or Wang's accusations, CNN recently spoke to a Bo family friend who revealed that a family-appointed lawyer had spoken to the disgraced politician several times since late last year. During those meetings, Bo's spirits were said to be high. The lawyer claimed Bo denies government allegations against him and wants an ""open trial and the opportunity to defend himself during that process."" Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian conflict has become ""increasingly militarized"" as killings and torture by regime security forces and anti-government fighters raged this spring, a United Nations panel reported Thursday. Meanwhile, the U.N. secretary-general said there is no fallback plan to deploying monitors to some of the Middle Eastern nation's most embattled cities. U.N. monitors on the ground in five Syrian cities are making ""all possible efforts to stop violence"" and have had ""some dampening effect,"" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. But he conceded, ""We were not able to completely cease the violence."" In an interview on ""Amanpour,"" Ban said the full cadre of observers -- 300 -- authorized by the Security Council last month would be on site in the coming days. ""They are patrolling every day, whenever possible,"" he said. ""They try their best to cease this violence. It requires strong political will at the level of President Assad, and also it requires full cooperation by the opposition forces."" The report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria noted the growing power of forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. ""Whereas government forces had previously been responding primarily to demonstrations, they now face armed and well-organized fighters -- bolstered by defectors who joined them."" ""Gross violations continue unabated,"" the commission's report said, adding regime forces commit most of the ""serious human rights violations."" The documented abuses ""reflect this shifting context"" amid widespread fears that the popular uprising against the regime of al-Assad, spurred by a tough crackdown against peaceful protests, is spiraling toward all-out civil war. Violence has raged daily. At least 40 civilians were killed across the country Thursday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said, among them ""a complete family ... martyred in the shelling"" of a neighborhood in Hama. Another opposition group, the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, reported 43 people killed. Its toll includes 35 civilians mostly in the provinces of Homs, Hama and Idlib, as well as eight government forces dead in clashes with defectors in Damascus, Deir Ezzor, Homs and Idlib. U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people, mostly civilians, have died and tens of thousands have been uprooted since the uprising began in March 2011. Opposition groups report a higher death toll in excess of 11,000 people. The commission said abuses have mounted since March, even though al-Assad's government and opposition forces say they have embraced U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan that includes a cease-fire. The military has conducted ""large-scale"" strikes on sites known for ""hosting defectors and/or armed persons"" escorting protests or supporting the Free Syrian Army, the anti-government resistance force, the report said. People have died when security forces shelled ""small opposition strongholds,"" conducted house-to-house searches and placed snipers on rooftops. Lethal force has been used against protesters in Idlib, Homs, Aleppo, Hama, Damascus, Daraa and villages nationwide. ""Many such protests were accompanied by armed groups, which have described their role as providing protection for the demonstrators,"" the report said. ""The resulting clashes were deadly for demonstrators, members of these armed groups and security forces alike, yet too often citizens bore the brunt of the violence."" Torture and arbitrary arrest remain a problem, the report's authors said, citing the case of a man accused of trafficking for anti-government groups as an example. ""They allegedly beat him severely and applied electric shocks to his legs,"" the report said. Children have been killed or injured in attacks on protests and by snipers' gunfire, while government forces have targeted schools and used one as a command post. Boys as young as age 10 detained by regime forces ""repeatedly indicate that they are tortured to admit that older male members of their family are 'Free Syrian Army' soldiers or supporters,"" the report said. ""Wounded children have been unable to seek treatment due to fears of being perceived as anti-government armed groups supporters or for fear of being beaten in health facilities. Children have died due to a lack of health care during government blockades. Some, including those injured as a result of torture, have been willfully denied medical care."" Anti-government armed groups have executed security forces and suspected collaborators, the report said. One military defector cited the execution of three Iranian snipers, and there have been reports of ""makeshift prisons."" ""One anti-government armed group fighter also admitted that he and his associates had killed government soldiers when the captives refused to join them,"" the report said. The groups also have increased their use of homemade bombs known as improvised explosive devices. Some people interviewed described bombs made of ""nails inside pipes with explosive powder and a fuse,"" and others made of gas and fertilizer. One fighter described planting mines that targeted army tanks. There have been reports of security forces or their supporters confessing under torture after their capture by resistance fighters. ""Two Iranians, held in late January 2012 and released in late April 2012, later made public statements about physical abuse suffered, including the breaking of bones, during their captivity,"" the report said. There have been instances of fighters kidnapping security forces and civilians, purportedly for prisoner exchanges but also for use as ransoms to buy weapons. Some anti-government groups have used children ""as medical porters, messengers and cooks, for units in the field and delivery of medical supplies to field hospitals."" The report pointed to bombing attacks in Damascus, Aleppo and Daraa between March and May, including the suicide car bombings in Damascus on May 10 that left 55 people dead. The commission said it can't ""ascertain"" who is responsible for the ""criminal"" acts. Some experts and officials say neither security forces nor anti-government forces may be responsible, suggesting ""third"" forces -- such as jihadi groups -- may be to blame. Ban distanced himself from his earlier assertion that al Qaeda ""must be"" behind the Damascus bombings, saying Thursday, ""We do not have any clear evidence what al Qaeda was behind."" Nonetheless, ""considering the scale and sophistication of the terrorist attacks,"" the U.N. leader said, ""it seems to be clear that there are certain organizations and groups with ... clear political intent."" One senior Jordanian official told CNN that there are nearly 1,500 al Qaeda members and sympathizers in Syria. Many have entered the country from Iraq and Lebanon and have been part of a bombing and ambush campaign against Syrian intelligence and military targets. American officials are concerned about jihadists in Syria and work with border countries to thwart them. But some U.S. officials say the 1,500 number is too high. Ban said Thursday the growing tension in Lebanon, where clashes erupted earlier this week after the killing of two anti-Assad clerics, is very troubling. ""We are entering into a pivotal moment,"" Ban told Amanpour. ""We are very much worried about this kind of spillover effect. ... We have to prevent this."" The report was issued as Syria's newly elected parliament convened to elect a speaker and swear in new members. The government said the elections were all-inclusive, but opposition forces call the process a sham. The opposition Syrian National Council is looking for a new leader after the resignation of its Paris-based president, Burhan Ghalioun. Syria's opposition has long been fractious, proving a disappointment to Western and Arab nations who dislike the regime and want al-Assad out of power. CNN's Barbara Starr and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","NEW: One opposition group reports 35 civilians dead; another says 40 were killed .

"(EW.com) -- Yep, folks, we finally met the mother: Monday night's ""How I Met Your Mother"" revealed actress Cristin Milioti as the show's titular — and, until now, extremely elusive — character. The unveiling took place in the final few seconds of the season 8 finale, as Milioti's yet-unnamed character simply walked up to a Long Island Rail Road ticket booth to purchase one ticket to the fictional Farhampton, presumably to go play in the band at the impending nuptials between Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) and Robin (Cobie Smulders). The show didn't exactly spell out the reveal (casual fans could have missed it), but there was one key to knowing the doe-eyed girl was the mother: the bright yellow umbrella she was holding. That's the linchpin accessory the show's narrator and father Ted (Josh Radnor) previously set up as the woman's signature — and identifying — item. EW was on set for the filming of the game-changing scene, and scored an exclusive interview with co-creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas. The pair revealed, among many other things, that we likely would have met the mother in May 2013 no matter what: The original plan was for the show to end after just eight seasons (meaning it would have been over...now), with the mother briefly introduced in the series finale. Only after HIMYM was extended to nine seasons did Bays and Thomas make the decision to reveal the mother before the final season — in tonight's episode. (Though it seems Ted won't be coming face-to-face with her until much later next season.) EW: 'HIMYM' recap One ticket to Farhampton . While the scene answered the biggest burning question — who was the woman at the center of the saga that Ted has been reliving for his kids (and viewers) since the show first launched in 2005? — it left us with many, many more: Why do this now? Why didn't they cast a big, big star? Why wasn't the mother actually Robin? How was the long-awaited casting kept secret from the show's incredibly rabid followers? Read on as Bays and Thomas break down the Mother of all reveals. Entertainment Weekly: It's already been announced that next season will be your last. With another year to go, why introduce the mother now? Carter Bays: One of our hard and fast rules [when we thought we were doing eight seasons] was that we didn't want to meet her until the very end. We felt like, now that we're doing another year, let's find an interesting new twist. Craig Thomas: We've talked here and there about letting the audience see the mother before Ted. Would that be fascinating or let some air out of the balloon? We were scared of it for a long time, but this past season, it came up, and it just fit in so well. Ultimately we view it like we've been honing in on this mother mystery for so long. In season one, it was like a shot of planet earth from outer space. And we've honed in and honed in and honed in, and we look at season nine as like now we're down to Google street view. We've gone from a super-wide shot to super-microscopic-tight, and it just felt right to see the mother's face and to give the audience that gift and that knowledge. There was something exciting about getting a little bit of her before Ted ever does. There was something that we felt like this audience who has stuck with us for all of these years we wanted to reward them with that. EW: 'HIMYM' casting poll . Bays: And to give ourselves the gift of having something. We didn't want to do season 9 unless we had something that just got us really excited to write it. This concept got us very excited to write it and lent itself to a lot of great ideas that came out. The tipping point was when you have enough ideas that you're going to be bummed if you don't get to try these ideas, that's when it became worth it for us to do season 9, and part of that is revealing the mother. The idea of getting to know her, getting to know where she's coming from, it became too tantalizing to pass up. We always liked the poetic ending of you never really get to know her, you just see her face or something. EW: Truly, this is pay-off for the fans. Thomas: The thing we're proud about in this series, we were able to pack some real surprises into the conventional sitcom form. A lot of viewers have given up on meeting the mother prior to the final episode. There are a lot of people who think that's true. I think this will count as a genuine surprise for a lot of people. A lot of people think, ""Oh, they got another year; we're never going to see her face this year."" I think the way that the season ends, I'm hoping it will blow some people's minds and surprise them and make them want to tune in and see what the hell we're going to do with that. EW: There wasn't a peep out there about this happening. Was the surprise element crucial to how you wanted this to roll out on screen? Bays: It's an intended thing. And partly, it's a fun way to do it. It will be fun to see people's reactions. There's something about as far as how as our experience as the audience is reflected in Ted's experience as a single guy, I like the idea of you never know when it's going to happen, and when it does happen, it just happens and there she is. I think it's a way to put the audience in Ted's shoes a little bit even though he doesn't actually meet her in this episode. EW: How did you keep the whole thing a secret? Thomas: In the script we called the character ""definitely not the mother,"" so it was very good code. We got very CIA and intense about it: We really didn't put it on paper; we never emailed the outline or the script. We literally just kept it on hard copies of paper that we messengered back and forth to people and then got the copies back and destroyed [them]. Bays: We had like a whole fake title. The script that we auditioned her from was titled ""USC Student Thesis Film."" Thomas: Something no one in Hollywood would ever actually read. Bays: All the extras from the scene with the mother are staff from How I Met Your Mother. They're all there. It was really fun. EW: 'HIMYM' renewed for final season . EW: How did it feel to finally have Milioti on set and see it all play out? Thomas: She just had to walk and say one line, but we were all freaking out and losing our minds. All she said was, ""One ticket to Far Hampton, please."" It was a very surreal moment. It was a moment we pictured for a lot of years, and ultimately it was great. EW: It seems like people thought the mother would be a big star. Did you ever consider going that route? Thomas: We didn't want it to be a big famous star because we didn't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be, where it's like, ""Oh, it's Anne Hathaway and I think blank of Anne Hathaway...."" You're waiting years to meet this woman, and it's like, ""Oh, he's in love with Amy Adams just like the rest of America is."" The whole idea is that Ted's never seen this woman before, so it better feel that way to the audience."" Cristin Milioti is she's a fantastic actress and she's been in [Broadway musica] Once, and it's a Tony-nominated, wonderful musical but she hasn't done a ton of big TV parts or bigger film parts. It seems so much more interesting and so much more ted to find someone special and unique and new, someone that we haven't seen before and the whole idea is that Ted's never seen this woman before, so it better feel that way to the audience. Bays: I don't think it ever occurred to us. Honestly, exhibit A for us in the discussions was Cobie Smulders. In the pilot of our show, Ted sees [Cobie Smulders'] Robin for the first time and — without naming names — the part of Robin was offered to a pretty famous actress and she turned it down and then we ended up going with Cobie, who was our first choice from the beginning. Thank God we did for a million reasons but among those is the fact that when Ted's seeing her for the first time, America's seeing her for the first time — the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive. EW: Was there ever a moment when you thought about trying to make Robin the mother? Bays: No. We've heard that question a lot. What always made the show interesting to us is that Ted meets the perfect woman, and it's [still] not his final love story.

"Montevideo, Uruguay (CNN) -- Uruguay's lower house passed a marijuana legalization bill Wednesday, bringing the South American nation one step closer to becoming the first to legally regulate production, distribution and sale of the drug. After more than 12 hours of debate, the bill garnered the 50 votes it needed to pass in the House of Representatives. Forty-six lawmakers voted against the bill. The country's senate is expected to take up the measure in October. President Jose Mujica has said he backs the bill, which would allow marijuana to be sold in pharmacies and create a registry of those who buy it. Only those 18 and older would be allowed to purchase the drug. He told CNN en EspaÃ±ol last year that he supported legalizing marijuana. ""If we legalize it, we think that we will spoil the market (for drug traffickers) because we are going to sell it for cheaper than it is sold on the black market,"" he said. ""And we are going to have people identified."" Conservative critics of the measure have said it promotes drug addiction and have suggested that Mujica's comments were uninformed. Supporters of the measure, including the Broad Front coalition of left-wing political parties, have said it will fight criminal drug trafficking and marks a turning point and could influence other Latin American nations to take a similar approach. ""This implies the materialization of a new paradigm in terms of drug policies,"" said Lisa Sanchez, director for Latin America of Transform Drug Policy Foundation. ""Uruguay will be the first country to establish effective state controls on the production, processing, distribution, storage and sale of marijuana, abandoning the prohibitionism and the punitive strategies. It is a turning point."" A letter sent by Mujica's government to lawmakers last year presented the bill. The goal, according to the letter, is to create a government-run market that would ""contribute to the reduction of risks and potential dangers that people who use marijuana for recreation or medical reasons face."" Marijuana is the most commonly used illegal substance in Uruguay, and drug traffickers net $30 million to $40 million annually from the black market, the government has said. ""Something I can say with certainty is that drug consumption is going to continue ... and we can't just keep on looking the other way,"" said Dario Perez, a Uruguayan legislator. Marijuana use is legal in Uruguay, but production and sale of the drug is not. Supporters of the country's legalization measure call that a paradox. ""The consumption of marijuana has been allowed for 40 years, but it can only be accessed through the narcos, and requires the commission of a crime, in addition to the exposure to other drugs,"" the Broad Front said in a statement on its website. ""We have created a great business for drug trafficking, and that is what we want to start to fight."" In recent years, legalization measures have gained growing traction among some Latin America leaders amid rising violence many tie to the drug war. But drug legalization still has fierce critics. Obama administration officials have repeatedly stressed their opposition to such proposals when they've been floated in other countries. Last year, John Walters, who directed the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy from 2001 to 2009, told CNN that decriminalization is ""utterly self-defeating"" and would cause more crime. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has become an outspoken supporter of marijuana legalization. Using military force to fight cartels doesn't work, he argues, but legalization would. ""With this, we will avoid the violence,"" Fox told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in May. ""We will control the criminals and reduce their income, and at the same time, it would become a transparent, accountable business in the hands of businessmen."" Journalists Eloisa Capurro and Dario Klein reported from Montevideo. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Fingers tickle keyboards fastidiously, bright-colored walls boast signs reading ""We Code Hard,"" and an idle foosball table waits for its next contenders. These are all signs you've entered a place for passionate tech enthusiasts. But if 'Bosun Tijani has his way, this is where Nigeria's next great idea will be born. Tijani is co-founder of the Co-Creation Hub -- or CcHub -- in Lagos, part of a 21st-century technology movement sweeping the African continent. Similar to Kenya's iHub and the newly opened Jozi Hub in South Africa, Nigeria's version also creates a state-of-the-art space for like-minded people to collaborate and innovate. The CcHub, though, aims to stand out from the pack with its focus on social responsibility. Read more: 'Africa's tallest building' set for $10 billion tech city . New smartphones and tablet computers may be trendy, says Tijani, but they're more powerful when harnessed in a way that improves healthcare, increases voter registration or ""bridges the gap between citizens and government."" Tackling that last concept is Oluseun Onigbinde, an original paying member of this innovation space and creator of the data-visualization site YourBudgIT.com. Onigbinde and his team have built colorful infographics explaining the highly complex, and some might say boring, Nigerian federal financial system. In one area, users can click through an animated display showing tiles sized relative to each and every government expense. If you click on a tile, like the Ministry of Education for example, additional breakdowns emerge showing how its money is divided. All of the information is current, some is displayed as maps or pie charts, and one section even allows users to experiment with increasing and decreasing specific funds. ""Most people never went to school to do public finance or economics,"" says Onigbinde, ""so you're [helping] people understand these things"" that are important to everyday life. Read more: Why tech innovators are Africa's future . Other developers, like Sola Ajayi, have their sights set on mobile phone applications. Ajayi created Efiko (which means bookworm) -- a multi-platform app of timed quizzes with shareable results aimed at secondary school students. Even young filmmakers enjoy coming to the CcHub to network with tech-savvy developers who might be able to help with movie editing or special effects software. The seemingly limitless potential of the CcHub made it a popular pillar of Nigeria's first ever Social Media Week. The global conference, which last month took place simultaneously in 10 cities stretching from New York to Tokyo, attracted entrepreneurs, investors, academics and government officials. Nigeria was the only African country to host an SMW event, and according to its global organizers, Lagos was the third ""most social"" city out of the entire bunch. Tijani's excitement, and exhaustion, during the event was evident as dozens of eager outsiders walked through the CcHub's workspace and filled its rooftop lounge. Understandable when you consider he and his team also squeezed in an hours-long meeting with Intel executives interested in what these young Nigerians are doing. Read more: Lagos Social Media Week: A local's guide to the city . CcHub's founders chose a central location for the hub because of a well thought out long-term strategy. It sits near the University of Lagos, so Nigerian students can easily visit, close to a design school so creative artists feel welcome, and down the street from more than a dozen tech startup companies so they can connect physically with like-minded entrepreneurs. Tijani says the next step is to convince the regional government to install fiber optic cables on surrounding streets and free Wi-Fi access to anyone within the hub's vicinity. He's confident it will happen, feeling optimistic as he looks over Lagos. ""Building solutions,"" he says, ""that's what this is about.""","Nigeria's CC Hub is an innovation space where tech-savvy people share ideas .

"(CNN) -- Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei lost his lawsuit against the Beijing tax bureau in a local court hearing Friday, leaving him still subject to tax evasion charges and more than $2 million in fines. The 53-year-old provocateur has been embroiled in a tax evasion case brought by the Chinese authorities last year against his company, Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd. Ai Weiwei paints bleak picture of his and China's future . He told CNN he was denied access to his second court hearing today, as he was to his first court hearing on June 20. Police called his mobile phone on Thursday afternoon, warning him not to go to court. Police cars were also parked outside his studio and Beijing Chaoyang District Court today, he said, much like his first hearing when tens of police cars surrounded his home, and public buses were rerouted away from the court area. Ai said many other activists were also detained in their homes. Ai told CNN that he would file an appeal to the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court. ""We appeal to the court in strict accordance with every law in China. We hope to give them a chance to realize their mistake and make it right."" ""It's not about my personal reputation,"" Ai added. ""I do this because we're citizens of this country, it's about everyone's safety and the justice of the law."" ""It's my obligation to keep appealing to a higher court, or I'll be part of the mistakes."" Ai contends the tax evasion charges are baseless and politically-motivated. In a characteristic ironic twist, Ai is hoping to get his day in court in other ways. In November, the authorities demanded he pay RMB 15 million (US$ 2.4 million) in back taxes and fines within two weeks. Tens of thousands of supporters donated more than RMB 9 million (US$ 1 million) to help him pay the bill, some even throwing RMB100 notes folded into paper airplanes over the gate of his house. Ai used the donations to post a payment guarantee of the invoice in order to file a lawsuit against the local tax bureau to protest the charges. Ai told CNN that he issued 13,000 IOUs during the donation process for those willing to accept them. As he will now be unable to repay the IOUs, the artist says he is urging the holders of the IOUs to sue him, so that he will forced to be in court ""for the next twenty years."" According to Chinese law, defendants are required to show up in court. The outspoken artist, blogger, documentary filmmaker, and architect was on his way to Hong Kong in April 2011 when he was taken into custody at Beijing's international airport and detained for 81 days amid a government crackdown on political activists. Ai's studio in Beijing was raided, and his wife and several employees were taken into custody for questioning. The government campaign was attributed to fears of a potential Arab-Spring-style uprising, following online calls for a ""Jasmine Revolution."" How Ai Weiwei became an Internet master . Seven weeks after Ai was taken into custody, state news agency Xinhua reported that Beijing police said his company, Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd., evaded a ""huge amount of taxes"" and ""intentionally destroyed accounting documents."" He was released on probation the following June and subjected to severe restrictions on his movements. Ai was forbidden to speak to the media or post on his Twitter account about his detainment. His phone was tapped, his e-mails were checked, and he had to report his appointments with other people to the police.

"(CNN) -- For most of his 70 years, Hesiquio Trevizo has been a man of good will, preaching the word of God. These days, the Roman Catholic priest is a self-described capitan de la guerra -- a war veteran. That he should feel so within the confines of the sanctuary tells all about the violence and pervasive fear that have gripped the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. ""None of us are entirely safe from organized crime. Not even priests,"" Trevizo says. He laughs, awkwardly. Trepidation leaks out with every word. Perhaps the most important aspect of his job as a priest makes him a potential target for organized crime. Criminals know that grisly details of violence have spilled out in the privacy of the confessional, and crime bosses would rather not have those details repeated or remembered. A bloody war between Mexico's drug cartels has changed every facet of life in places such as Juarez, where death figures compare to those in war-ravaged Baghdad or Kabul. Even the untouchable aura of clerics in the world's second-biggest Catholic country is being challenged. In 2009, more than 2,575 people were homicide victims of organized crime. As of Monday, 230 killings had been recorded in Juarez this year, state attorney general's office spokesman Arturo Sandoval told CNN. All of the estimated 1.4 million residents in Juarez -- just across the border from El Paso, Texas -- have been affected, if only indirectly, by an escalating turf war between the Sinaloa cartel and the Vicente Carillo Fuentes cartel, better known as the Juarez cartel. The fallout, mainly over Juarez's trafficking route, has turned once-close allies into deadly rivals. Until about 2001, the two cartels operated with mutual respect, navigating the territory almost harmoniously and sometimes working together to transport drugs from the region to the insatiable market of drug users in the United States. But now, a crackdown by President Felipe Calderon, coupled with dissolved trusts among key cartel members, have created knee-jerk chaos. Gangs affiliated with the cartels have heightened the violence as they fight for turf in street-level sales, Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told CNN. Juarez was once a city where innocents were safe, but that memory is fading fast. Even those who aren't aligned with the drug trade have been targeted, among them priests. They were once revered in Mexican communities, but a collar is not protection anymore in the violent clashes over territory and power. Trevizo, who ought to fear nothing, watches his back. He agreed to be interviewed by CNN, but balked at being photographed or even having a photo of his church published, citing safety concerns. Suspicions dictate his decisions. He closes the doors to his church earlier. At Sunday Mass, he asks parishioners to enter through a specific door rather than flock in from every direction. The church offices are dead-bolted shut. The paralysis-like atmosphere spills onto the streets, shops and residences of Juarez, where incredulous people peep through window blinds and seemingly creep by in the streets. Many residents escape from populated parts of town during the day and often stay home after dusk. Life goes on amid the violence, and added precautions are taken in stride. Sometimes, Trevizo wonders who among his flock might leave the church and pick up an assault weapon. He does not know whether there are killers who step inside the sanctuary. But he knows there are victims. He attended the funeral of a lawyer who was assassinated. During the procession, the lawyer's daughter was gunned down before Trevizo. The convoy she was in, which followed her father's casket, was ambushed by gunmen as it approached the cemetery. Trevizo said he didn't know whether she was the target, but the lawyer was an outspoken critic of organized crime. Trevizo was uneasy when asked for other details. ""I can't explain to you what it's like to go to the funeral of someone you've prayed with,"" he said. But he mentally braces for more of the same. Two weeks before Christmas, a gunman roughed up a priest at a nearby church. The attacker fled with the priest's wallet and mobile phone. Sometimes in Juarez, violence happens because it can, because no one will think it extraordinary. Two weeks ago, the body of a sacristan -- a person charged with taking care of a church -- was found with fatal stab wounds in a church in western Juarez. No motive was apparent, a police spokesman told CNN. There are those who take advantage of the chaos in a place like Juarez, Trevizo says. Some crimes are committed by petty thieves who pass themselves off as cartel members. ""Not all crime is organized,"" he said. Trevizo spoke with CNN days after Juarez diocese Bishop Ascensio de Leon read an open letter to more than 1,000 parishioners at his church for Sunday Mass. The letter, written by the bishops of Mexico, addressed organized crime. In the speech, Ascensio called for organized criminals to give up their lifestyle and turn to God. He also said priests in Juarez are now being extorted and threatened by organized criminals. To ensure that priests do not repeat what parishioners tell them, drug traffickers are sending a message. ""Yes, there have been some priests that have received threatening phone calls from narcotraficantes. Not me, but others. Bishop Ascensio has. I've been lucky. We're not necessarily singled out by them. We're victims like every other citizen. No more, no less,"" Trevizo says. At least seven priests have been violently killed in Mexico since 2005, including being kidnapped, shot and beaten. Organized crime has been suspected in some of those cases, according to Manuel Corral, public relations secretary for Mexico's Council of Bishops. He estimated that 1,000 of the 15,000 priests in Mexico have been threatened in some way, and that 300 priests have been threatened directly. In June 2009, the killings of a Catholic priest and two seminary students as they left a church in southern Mexico sparked outrage. The priest was reportedly singled out for denouncing cartel violence. He had rallied congregants to rise up against drug traffickers. Especially in rural villages across Mexico -- where drug traffickers reign like kings and the military has no presence -- it is the Catholic Church and evangelists who are left as outspoken critics. However, in some of Mexico's poorest villages, it is unclear how closely the church and organized criminals operate. Some critics say churches have received large donations from traffickers. For Trevizo and his brethren, faith is still central to much of life. But fear tests that faith, including the fear of being powerless to make things better. CNN's Arthur Brice and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","For Hesiquio Trevizo, fear of violence permeates his work and church .

"(CNN) -- Manfred Zbrzezny wants to bulk up his arsenal. For the past few years, the founder of the Liberia-based Fyrkuna Metalworks and his team of skilful craftsmen have been collecting weapons scrap -- relics of the West African country's vicious civil conflict -- for their Arms into Art project. From their open-sided workshop near Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, the artisans expertly cut, melt and weld scrap metals to fashion them into intricate sculptures. In their hands, decommissioned AK-47s, RPG launchers and bazookas are transformed into elaborate candle stands, whimsical lamps and even life-size metal trees. ""What was an instrument of suffering can become something beautiful and useful,"" says Zbrzezny, a German/Italian artistic blacksmith who's been calling Liberia home since the mid-2000s.

""I prefer doing my pieces a little bit funny or sweet, instead of doing something macabre or rough."" Remnants of war . For materials, Fyrkuna first relied on the decommissioned instruments of warfare gathered during Liberia's disarmament process. On some occasions, individuals who've come to know their work have also brought in discarded guns they've found for the craftsmen to work with. Zbrzezny, whose team of Liberian workers includes four staff and two trainees, says he is now looking to expand the project and hopefully export of some of his artwork abroad.

Although the fighting came to an end in 2003, leaving an estimated 250,000 people dead and thousands more displaced, many in Liberia still bear the deep scars of years of conflict. ""There's nobody who wasn't affected by the war,"" says Zbrzezny, who first traveled to Liberia before the end of the conflict in 2003. He describes Fyrkuna's work as a way of helping the nation heal its wounds by transforming the destructive devices of its war-torn past into something positive. ""Looking at Arms into Art the majority of people remains thoughtfully silent,"" he says. ""This moment of silence acts like a flashback, a remembering of the war and ... is also an indicator for me that there is a long psychological work to do on the war issue.

"New York (CNN) -- A self-described ""ex-madam"" who claims she supplied fellow city comptroller candidate Eliot Spitzer with escorts several years ago is facing charges of illegally distributing prescription drugs, authorities said. Kristin Davis, 38, was arrested on Monday night and charged with selling Adderall, Xanax and other drugs. She's also accused of orchestrating the sale of approximately 180 oxycodone pills for cash. The candidate was released Tuesday on $100,000 bail, with a preliminary hearing scheduled for September 5. Prosecutors said she will have strict pretrial supervision. ""Prescription drug abuse is the fastest-growing drug problem in this country, resulting in more overdose deaths than heroin and cocaine combined, and this office has a zero tolerance policy towards anyone who helps to spread this plague at any level,"" Preet Bharara, Manhattan U.S. Attorney, said in a statement. Spitzer, Weiner and why New York is talking about sex . Davis is charged with four counts of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance. She faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count, if convicted. Prosecutors allege that from 2009 through 2011 Davis bought ecstasy pills, Adderall pills and Xanax pills from an FBI cooperating witness at least once a month, paying hundreds of dollars for each purchase. She told the witness she provided these drugs to people at house parties, authorities say. An attorney for Davis was could not be immediately reached for comment. Davis' campaign manager, Andrew Miller, said he was aware of the arrest but couldn't provide any information. Has the road to redemption gotten shorter? Based on information from the FBI's witness, the FBI set up a sting operation from January through March of this year, in which Davis sold pills on three separate occasions to the witness, who she believed to be a drug dealer, the complaint states. Davis became synonymous with the prostitution scandal involving Spitzer, then serving as governor. She has no proof of her arranging escorts for Spitzer, but she did spend four months behind bars because of her business. Spitzer, a Democrat, resigned in 2008. A former hedge fund senior vice president, Davis is running as a Libertarian with a plan to legalize marijuana in New York City.

"(CNN) -- The killing last weekend of a Catholic priest and two seminary students in southwest Mexico marked the first time that drug cartel hit men have purposefully targeted a clergyman, said Manuel Corral, public relations secretary for Mexico's Council of Bishops. The Rev. Habacuc Hernandez Benitez, 39, was gunned down as he traveled in a vehicle in the town of Arcelia in the state of Guerrero, together with two seminary students, Eduardo Oregon Benitez, 19, and Silvestre Gonzalez Cambron, 21. ""In this case the drug traffickers followed them and ambushed them,"" said Corral, who declined to name which cartel is suspected behind the incident. Authorities have not stated a motive in the case, but Corral said one line of investigation is that one of the seminary students had a family member involved with a drug cartel, and that the three were killed as revenge for some cause. At least seven priests have been killed in Mexico since 2005 under violent circumstances, including being kidnapped, shot and beaten. Organized crime has been suspected in some of these cases, but Saturday's killing in Guerrero left no doubt of the perpetrators' business, Corral said. Hernandez and the two seminarians had just celebrated Mass in Arcelia and were leaving the area when a group of unknown gunmen pulled up next to their vehicle and opened fire, according to the local human rights organization Montana Tlachinollan. Local reports added that after shooting the priest's vehicle, the gunmen pulled the men outside and shot them in the back. The incident paralyzed area residents to the point that no one in the town would go to identify the bodies, Montana Tlachinollan reported. The three victims remained ""unknown"" until someone from out of town came to officially identify them. Since taking office in 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calderon has made the fight against drug cartels a priority. He has dispatched more than 25,000 troops to augment local police forces. Last year, drug violence was blamed for the deaths of 78 Mexican soldiers and more than 6,000 others. This year, the drug violence has claimed more than 2,900 lives, according to the newspaper El Universal. The clergy has not been spared from the spike in drug-related violence that has afflicted regions of Mexico, Corral said. ""The threats are not new,"" he said. ""As drug trafficking continued to grow, from about 2004 on, the priests continued to denounce it, and they themselves were threatened."" In April, the archbishop of the northern state of Durango raised fears of attacks on the clergy after he said that Mexico's most wanted man, Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, lives in a Durango town and that ""everybody knows it except the authorities."" The comment, which was made in private conversation, stirred fears of retaliation and the archbishop backed off his statement after it quickly spread. Of the 15,000 priests in Mexico, Corral estimated that 1,000 had been threatened in some form, and that 300 priests have been threatened directly. Those direct threats -- usually in the form of ""shut up, or we'll shut you up"" -- have come from intermediaries for organized crime or anonymously, Corral said. The threats against the clergy have been serious enough that in some 20 cases, priests in Mexico were transferred to other parishes out of regard for their safety, he said. The targeting of a priest is significant because it marks another boundary crossed by drug cartels, Corral said. Bishops have noted that in surveys they conduct with families in their dioceses, drug dealing and domestic drug use top the list of problems families face, whereas three or five years ago it didn't make the list. As enforcement action in Mexico and the United States has increased, domestic drug consumption in Mexico has increased. Domestic drug use has torn families apart and made the new generation of traffickers more violent and less respectful of institutions like the church, Corral said. But these same traffickers who threaten priests are paradoxically the same people that the church wants to reach. ""Rebuilding the social fabric has been a mission of the church,"" Corral said. ""We can't live in fear."" Another notable killing, the 1993 murder of Guadalajara Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, has been attributed by some as a case of mistaken identity by drug traffickers, though church officials have publicly expressed doubts that the killers were traffickers. The state of Guerrero, known for its beach destination of Acapulco, in recent years has been the setting of turf wars over drug trafficking routes between the Gulf cartel, the Sinaloa cartel, and an organization known as La Familia.","Priest's murder crosses a line, says Manuel Corral of Mexico's Council of Bishops .
Of 15,000 priests in Mexico, 1,000 have been threatened by traffickers, Corral says .
Clergy have long denounced drug world, but now have become targets themselves ."
"(CNN) -- Pretty soon you'll be able to print your 3-D projects at the local Staples. A new service called ""Staples Easy 3D"" will allow customers to upload their designs to Staples' website, then pick up the printed objects at their local office supply megastore, or have them shipped to their home or business â€” not unlike the photo- and document-printing service the company already offers. The project was announced today at Euromold 2012 by 3-D printer manufacturer Mcor Technologies, who is partnering with Staples to provide its new Iris printers for the service. The Iris printers employ an innovative method to generate objects, using reams of paper that are cut and printed while being stacked and glued together. This technique allows for a high-resolution layer thickness of 100 microns, similar to that of the MakerBot Replicator 2, but not quite as fine as the 25-micron capability of the Form 1. The new printers also incorporate the ability to add photorealistic coloring â€” something that more common plastic printers can't yet achieve. But while the glued paper is said to have a wood-like hardness, the arrangement of the layered paper grain will require special consideration for certain design layouts (this can affect other types of 3-D printers as well). And while the company says it is able to be drilled, tapped or screwed, its material properties are unknown compared to traditional materials like real wood or steel. Still, the move by an established corporation to offer 3-D printing further legitimizes the adoption of the rapidly growing field by the mass market. Similar services currently exist, being offered by companies like Shapeways and Sculpteo, but this is the first to be made available from a chain retailer. Staples Easy 3D will launch in the Netherlands and Belgium in the first quarter of 2013, and will be rolled out to other countries shortly afterword.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- There's a new option for anyone who's wanted to dabble in 3-D printing but didn't know where to start. On Monday, MakerBot founder Bre Pettis unveiled a trio of 3-D printers, including a new device for beginners, at a news conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The company has come a long way since it was founded in 2009. An entire commercial 3-D printing industry has spring up since then, and this year, 28 exhibitors are showing off their 3-D printer-related products on the CES show floor. MakerBot, still the highest profile 3-D printer company, has one for each level of maker, from the complete novice to a serious professional. They include fun new features such as a built-in camera for monitoring progress from a mobile device and the ability to send files over WiFi. Here's a look at the three printers: . MakerBot Mini . The small, adorable, one-button MakerBot Mini is aimed at the growing consumer 3-D printing market, but its $1,375 price point is still far above some entry level printers. The Mini is designed to be easy to use for people who have no previous 3-D printing experience. Pettis compared it to a point-and-shoot camera. There's a tablet app for making 3-D models and buying existing models for as little as 99 cents. After deciding what they want to print, a person can send the instructions to the printer over WiFi or USB and then hit the single button on the face of the printer to start the project. A small camera in the printer streams to the mobile or desktop app so someone can monitor the status of a project while mixing a margarita in the next room. It can also upload shots of the finished products to a cloud library and share them on social networks. MakerBot Replicator . The classic and popular MakerBot Replicator has been revamped again. The fifth-generation printer will sell for $2,899, and it will feature speed, quality and feature updates. It can print objects 11% larger than its predecessor. Behind the scenes are software and firmware upgrades. On the front of the printer is a new 3.5-inch LCD screen you navigate with a giant stereo knob. The device can do a quick draft print or a super high-quality version. The Replicator has gained some new communication skills. A phone, tablet or computer can send prints to the device over USB or ethernet, and soon devices will be able to communicate with the Replicator over WiFi. Like the Mini, the Replicator will work with the new mobile app when it is released in the spring. It can also send notifications about PLA plastic levels and pause a print job when the levels are low so you don't have to start over in the middle of a model.

"Sochi, Russia (CNN) -- Olympiads often come with their fair share of controversy, and the Russian city of Sochi -- the host for the 22nd Winter Games -- drew more than its fair share. But aside from the security concerns that may now seem over anxious, accommodation complaints made in main by attending media, warm weather that failed to melt the venue's snow, and domestic laws that arguably ran contrary to the Olympic spirit, the sporting occasion that unfolded was worthy of much celebration. From a spectator point of view the new venues -- whether at the temperate coast or in the crisp mountain zone -- provided fantastic stages for the world's finest winter sports athletes to compete for the glory of becoming champion. Just under 3,000 competitors from 88 nations vied over 17 days in 98 events, providing moments of drama and destiny that captured the imagination and settled in the collective memory. Below are my 10 highlights from the Games. Have your say in the comments box at the bottom: . 1. Canada's hockey haul: . In a poll carried out on the CNN live blog, 42% of you voted for this as your favorite sporting moment of Sochi 2014, and there will be no argument against such wisdom here. Facing a two-goal deficit against their neighborly rivals the United States, and with just four minutes left of the third period, Canada refused to accept defeat. Brianne Jenner got her team back into the game before Marie-Philip Poulin sensationally equalized. An enthralling overtime then saw Poulin strike again in a power play to seal a 3-2 victory. It was an epic comeback to win gold, but it didn't end there. Just three days later the men's side -- after inflicting their own defeat on the U.S. in the semifinals -- crushed an out-classed Sweden 3-0 to defend the title they won in Vancouver. Canada's men have now topped the podium in three of the past four Olympics (2002, 2010, 2014), which by anyone's standards is a great achievement. 2. Dutch dominance: . The Adler Arena is a world-class facility worthy of hosting the best long-track speed skaters from across the planet, but the thoughtful designers suffered from a key oversight: If the winners' podium had been located more closely to the Dutch team area it would have saved a lot of bother. So dominant were the orange-clad gliders that even if every other nation had formed one team, the Netherlands would still have nearly doubled their medal tally. What started with an opening-day clean sweep in the men's 5,000 meters was bookended by victory in the men's team pursuit, as the team set an Olympic record in the last race of the Games. The Dutch haul included eight golds, seven silvers and eight bronzes, accounting for 23 of the 30 individual medals up for grabs. Truly staggering. 3. An the victor: . Russia hoped they'd picked up an ace card when South Korean short-track skater Ahn Hyun-soo, a three-time gold medal winner from the Turin Games, gained his citizenship in 2011. Discarded by the nation of his birth for being too old and injury prone, he promptly changed his name to Victor An and plotted revenge. In a remarkable run in Sochi, An drew cheers from his adopted nation and boos from Koreans by winning the men's 500m, 1,000m and the 5,000m relay too. He also picked up a bronze in the 1,500m event. In doing so, An took his career gold tally to six, became Russia's first short-track champion at 1,000m and also is the first person to win gold in all four short-track events in Winter Olympics history. We can only wonder what the South Korean team thought of that. 4. Superpower showdown: . OK, so we have two hockey submissions to the list but this game was surely worth it. The former Cold War rivals, 34 years after the ""Miracle on Ice,"" met again in the Bolshoy Ice Dome and tested the resolve of the new roof by creating an exhilarating atmosphere with this Olympic classic. The home crowd was vociferous, partisan and passionate; especially when their side took the lead in the second. But the U.S. fought back off the ropes to equalize on the counter and then took the lead shortly after. All seemed lost to many anxious fans until Pavel Datsyuk draw Russia level. This is when the real drama started. Fedor Tyutin thought he'd won it for his side before his goal was ruled out to America's relief. The game then went to overtime followed by a nail-biting, finger-chewing and hand-swallowing sudden-death shootout in which T.J. Oshie scored four goals from six attempts to secure the U.S. victory. In truth, neither side played as well again. 5. Bjoergen the Great: . Norway's Marit Bjoergen told reporters in Sochi that, at the age of 33, the time may be right for her to turn her attention away from the 2018 Winter Games and towards having a family instead. Bad news for Norway but a godsend for any ambitious cross-country skier out there, because Bjoergen's grip on the top prizes of the discipline has been so tight there's been little room for anyone else. A triple-gold medal winner in Vancouver, Bjoergen took the top prize in the 30 km mass start, the 15 km skiathlon and the team sprint classic here in Sochi to cement her place as the most decorated female in Winter Olympics history. Arguably, the sweetest of her 10 career medals came in what could be her last event at the Games, when she topped the podium in the first Norwegian clean sweep of the grueling 30 km race since 1992. 6. Biathlon's best: . Norway had good ""legendary"" representation in its men's team too, in the form of 40-year-old Ole Einar Bjoerndalen. It's 21 years since Bjoerndalen made his World Cup debut, but in Sochi he showed that age is no barrier to elite competition by winning the biathlon men's sprint and mixed relay too. The new trinkets pushed his career tally to eight golds from a record 13 medals overall and made him the oldest gold medalist in Olympic history. The man -- who became the first biathlete to win four gold medals at a single Games in 2002 -- told reporters: ""These victories have been a four-year job and it has been many years since I won (an individual gold medal), but life is too short to give up."" The Olympic spirit personified. 7. Dance destiny: . In a tale of ice skating rivalry that stretches over two Olympiads, the partnership of Meryl Davis and Charlie White gave America something to smile about despite those humbling hockey moments. They delivered the United States' first ice-dance gold as well as beating Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir -- the Vancouver champions -- into second place. It was a sweet moment for the two, who train with their opponents in Detroit, and saw a reverse of the result that gave them silver four years ago. But it was their near-flawless performance of the short program, which earned them a world-record score of 78.89, that captured the imagination. Their masterclass in synchronized fluidity delivered them an overall score of 195.52 to finish 4.53 ahead of Virtue and Moir. Davis said it was the result of ""17 years' hard work"" -- plus a little help from their Russian coach Marina Zoueva, who also works with Virtue and Moir. 8. Star rises in Sochi: . Olympic Games are often marked by the rising of new talent, and the 2014 edition that took place at the Black Sea resort were no different. Yulia Lipnitskaya -- a 15-year-old Russian figure skater -- had the crowds in Sochi giving standing ovations such was the brilliance of her audacious performances on ice. In the women's team competition she dazzled with her poetic, gyroscopic movement and became Russia's youngest champion ever. A fall in the individual competition allowed the gold to go to her compatriot Adelina Sotnikova, but her place in the hearts of so many had already been cemented. Who knows what she can achieve in the years to come. 9. A shared gold . Slovenia's pop-star skier Tina Maze had a Games to remember. She skied fantastically through slushy snow and difficult conditions to top the podium in the giant slalom, an event she led from start to finish and won from Anna Fenninger of Austria by just 0.07 seconds. But it's her performance in the downhill that will probably live longer in the memory after she made Games history, along with Dominique Gisin, when the pair registered identical times despite taking different paths down the slope. It was the first time a gold medal had been shared in the event's 78-year history. In winning, Maze also became the first woman since Marie-Theres Nadig of Switzerland in 1972 to be champion in both downhill disciplines. 10. Marriage delivers medals: . In a tale that will please romantics around the world, U.S.-born Vic Wild and his Russian wife Alena Zavarzina showed that love can help deliver medals as well as happiness. After struggling with financial support at home, snowboarder Wild became a Russian citizen in 2011 after his wedding and was determined to give a return to the show of faith from his adopted country. In a nice twist of fate he took gold in the parallel giant slalom minutes after his wife had captured bronze in the women's event. The win, followed by his success in the parallel slalom, meant he became the first snowboarder to win two golds in one Games.","Controversy aside, Sochi delivered a sporting occasion worthy of celebration .

"(CNN) -- Call it the Twitterfication of social sharing. As if it wasn't enough for Twitter to limit our bursts of inspiration to 140 written characters, it has now rolled out Vine, a video-sharing app that limits your videos to just six seconds. What can you do with six seconds of smartphone video (which, for now, is available only on iPhones, causing an aggravated Android Nation to again wail and wait)? Not re-enact ""Lawrence of Arabia"" using action figures. That would take 2,270 Vine posts, give or take. Nor can you document a successful rodeo bull ride; those require at least eight seconds. As the tech press largely fawns over the new tool's potential, we're taking a look at some of the ways the tool might affect your Twitter feed and the Web as a whole. And it seems only appropriate that we analyze Vine's six-second bursts in six points. Here's what Vine could do: . 1. Spur creativity . If, as the Bard wrote, brevity is the soul of wit, the six-second time limit could in fact inspire creativity. That's the logic behind Twitter itself, really. Once derided by critics as an example of society's increasingly gnat-like attention span, the site's 140-character limit has in many cases inspired users to be as witty, insightful or informative as they can be in as few words as possible. Twitter is sometimes called a ""microblogging"" site. Considering some of the long and winding blog posts we've read over the years, there's some value in spurring users to make their point quickly. Maybe Vine will do the same for Web video. ""My guess, given the enthusiasm for Twitter so far, is that people are going to do really cool things,"" Scott Klemmer, co-director of the Human-Computer Interaction Group at Stanford University, told Wired, a CNN content partner. ""One of the things we know about creativity is that constraints are essential for getting people to do creative stuff. If you come up with the right constraints, that's a benefit, not a drawback."" And here's an example: . (Of course, if you desperately need a 10-minute loop of sniveling King Joffrey from ""Game of Thrones"" getting slapped to a Led Zeppelin soundtrack, we've still got YouTube.) 2. Spam up your feed . A vine can be a lovely thing. Think Wrigley Field or the Ivy League. But it can also be a noxious weed. In the first 24 hours, the primary theme of most of the Vine videos we've seen has been ""Hey, I'm making a Vine video!"" We're not immune from this ourselves. That will probably change, in many cases, as creative folks fine-tune their craft. But let's be honest: Among Twitter's millions of users are a lot of people who will probably be sharing the banal and the stupid. And, if Web history holds true, clips of themselves naked. Hopefully, you've crafted your ""follow"" list to keep most of these people off your screen. Otherwise, you could find yourself clicking on a lot of videos of people's food. Which, as we all know, is what Instagram is for. 3. Turn Twitter into Facebook's video alternative . It surprisingly took a few months after Facebook bought the aforementioned Instagram, an app that lets users slap groovy-looking filters onto their photos, for it to cause a falling-out with Twitter. Facebook pulled Twitter's ability to show Instagram images in its feed. That's reserved for FB now. You can still post them to Twitter, of course, but followers see only a link that takes them to Instagram's website. Fair enough, we suppose. Why let a competitor reap the benefits of an app you just shelled out a reported $1 billion to buy? So, if that makes Facebook the go-to platform for social photos, maybe Vine makes Twitter the default place for fun mini-videos. As the platform strives to turn a profit, the Vine clips may give users a new reason to linger. 4. Invite more ""Oops"" moments . Delete all you want. Once you tweet something, it's out there forever. Ask Chris Brown. Or Gilbert Gottfried. Or Anthony Weiner. Put videocameras in the hands of millions, give them a platform to share the results with the rest of those millions, and bad decisions are sure to ensue. Often after a few cocktails, or if you're a celebrity. Given a new tool with which to share, or overshare, we all can expect more Twitter missteps. Many of us can't wait. 5. Continue the rebirth of ""GIFs"" OK, this one is already under way. Years after the Web gave us Peanut Butter Jelly Time, folks have rediscovered the joy of watching something quick and silly happen over and over again. Vine builds on this idea. Your six seconds (or fewer) of video loops for as long as the viewer lets it run. This can be disconcerting and annoying. But as folks get creative, it could also be clever. The first person to re-enact ""Dramatic Chipmunk"" has our undying devotion. (Fun discovery: That YouTube classic is exactly six seconds long). A Vine isn't actually a GIF (Graphic Interchange Format is the full name). But it can take advantage of the same instincts that have made GIFs an enduring Web feature. 6. Press the competition . Vine isn't the only mobile app jockeying to be the ""Instagram of Video."" Viddy, Tout, SocialCam and even the ill-fated Color all wanted to become the front-runner in this emerging social field. Twitter may have shut down that argument when it acquired Vine for an undisclosed amount. Sure, the mobile space has its share of stories in which the bantamweight manages to dance around a heavy hitter. Remember when Facebook Places was supposed to crush Foursquare? But Vine will be sitting right there in front of Twitter's more than 140 million users. The others will need to innovate or die. Have you seen any Vine videos you really liked, or made some of your own? Let us know in the comments.","With Vine, Twitter adds video to its short bursts of text .
The new app could spur more creativity among Twitter users .
It also might lead to lots of boring little videos in your feed .

"(CNN) -- Under mounting pressure from activists and advertisers, Facebook is ramping up efforts to stamp out hate speech, particularly depictions of violence against women. The move, announced Tuesday, came after a weeklong campaign by women's groups targeting pages that celebrated or made light of rape, domestic violence and sexual degradation of women. ""In recent days, it has become clear that our systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively as we would like, particularly around issues of gender-based hate,"" Marne Levine, a Facebook vice president in charge of public policy, wrote in a post on the site. ""In some cases, content is not being removed as quickly as we want. In other cases, content that should be removed has not been or has been evaluated using outdated criteria. We have been working over the past several months to improve our systems to respond to reports of violations, but the guidelines used by these systems have failed to capture all the content that violates our standards. We need to do better -- and we will."" A coalition of women's groups, under the banner Women, Action & the Media, celebrated the announcement, saying that Facebook has asked them to be part of an ongoing conversation about improvements to the social network. Pages flagged as offensive by the group had such names as ""Kicking Your Girlfriend in the Fanny Because She Won't Make You a Sandwich,"" ""Violently Raping Your Friend Just for Laughs,"" ""Raping Your Girlfriend"" and ""Fly Kicking Sluts in the Uterus."" Searching for those pages Wednesday delivered no results. ""It is because Facebook has committed to having policies to address these issues that we felt it was necessary to take these actions and press for that commitment to fully recognize how the real world safety gap experienced by women globally is dynamically related to our online lives,"" author Soraya Chemaly, who helped spearhead the effort, said in a post on the group's site. In Levine's post, Facebook promised to: . -- Update guidelines that its Community Standards team uses to identify hate speech, with help from legal experts and women's groups . -- Update training for team members who police hate speech . -- Increase accountability for Facebook users whose pages don't legally qualify as hate speech but who post content that is ""cruel or insensitive"" -- Implement a policy that requires users who create pages with questionable content to publicly attach their personal account to them . -- Encourage groups already working on cyber-hate issues to include the women's coalition. ""These are complicated challenges and raise complex issues,"" Levine wrote. ""Our recent experience reminds us that we can't answer them alone."" Tasked with policing a site with roughly 1 billion users, Facebook says it has sought to strike a balance between cracking down on hateful content while still allowing for freedom of expression. ""We seek to provide a platform where people can share and surface content, messages and ideas freely, while still respecting the rights of others,"" Levine said. ""To facilitate this goal, we also work hard to make our platform a safe and respectful place for sharing and connection. This requires us to make difficult decisions and balance concerns about free expression and community respect."" Such issues have come up repeatedly in the past, notably when Facebook users created fan pages celebrating accused Colorado theater shooter James Holmes or Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The recent campaign by women's groups was launched last Tuesday with an open letter to Facebook complaining about pages deemed offensive. The letter complained of a double standard toward imagery on the site in light of past controversies over Facebook removing more innocuous content, such as photos of women breastfeeding. ""These pages and images are approved by your moderators, while you regularly remove content such as pictures of women breastfeeding, women post-mastectomy and artistic representations of women's bodies,"" read the letter, signed by dozens of women's groups from around the world. ""It appears that Facebook considers violence against women to be less offensive than nonviolent images of women's bodies. ""In a world in which hundreds of thousands of women are assaulted daily and where intimate partner violence remains one of the leading causes of death for women around the world, it is not possible to sit on the fence. We call on Facebook to make the only responsible decision and take swift, clear action on this issue, to bring your policy on rape and domestic violence into line with your own moderation goals and guidelines."" On Twitter, supporters posted violent images they said were originally shared on Facebook pages. They included a picture of a woman at the bottom of a stairwell with the caption, ""Next time, don't get pregnant"" and multiple postings of a dramatized photo of a man threatening a frightened woman with captions like ""Dishes: Do them now"" and ""Women deserve equal rights ... and lefts."" The letter also encouraged people to contact Facebook advertisers. According to the group, supporters sent more than 5,000 e-mails to advertisers, in addition to posting messages to advertisers on Twitter and Facebook itself. The group claims that 15 companies said they were pulling their ads from Facebook as a result of the efforts. Nissan UK and Nationwide were among those who announced they were doing so while others, like Dove soap, said they were working with Facebook on a solution. ""We fully support that today @womenactmedia & @Facebook reached a joint position on rights,"" Nissan UK posted on its Twitter feed late Tuesday. User responses on Facebook's post were mixed. While many of the roughly 300 comments Wednesday morning thanked the site, others suggested it wasn't enough or speculated that it wouldn't have happened without pressure from advertisers. There was also pushback from users who called it a threat to free speech. ""Oh look,"" said user Mathew Bates. ""The hurt feelings police is attempting to undermine the First Amendment again."" Many, however, seemed optimistic -- but cautious. ""It's a start but I'll believe it when I see it in the long term,"" wrote user Melissa Perault. ""We need to make sure FB follows up on this."" Facebook's community standards page says, ""Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions, events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or medical condition.""","Facebook ramps up crackdown on hate speech after pressure from women's groups .

"(CNN) -- Speculation among political ""analysts"" has recently heated up around the idea that newly minted Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts might pose a real challenge to Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Never mind that Warren has zero executive experience, has been in Washington for the blink of an eye and has spent much of her life as an academic -- because of course, that's a formula that seems to have worked for the current occupant of the Oval Office (if not, as at least half the rabid commenters beneath this column will also argue, for the country.) Never mind that she has expressed no interest in the job. Never mind that the election of 2016 is three full years away and that almost anything can happen in that time including, according to a recent study in the journal Nature, many more asteroid strikes than we originally believed possible. Facts and sound reasoning be damned. Birds gotta fly and pundits gotta pundit. So off we go. Facts and probabilities don't matter in this kind of demented parlor game. It's about as useful as debating whether Justin Bieber -- if he were a scientific genius -- would devote himself to particle physics or mapping the human genome. It is a mania driven by the existential anxieties of the commentariat whose ""I chatter therefore I am"" philosophy implies that if they shut up they cease to exist. The result is a discussion about nothing, meaning precious little, and with not much to recommend other than its negligible entertainment value. But heck, Twitter reportedly is now worth more than $20 billion; investors have got to have people tweeting about something. It might as well be the debate about whether Warren's anti-Wall Street stance would be tough for Clinton to combat because she may be seen as too close to the establishment or, conversely, whether Warren's financial reform agenda would motivate the fat cats in the financial community to start writing fat checks for Clinton. Speaking of which, this kind of speculation has not been limited to the Democratic Party. This week, aside from Time magazine's cheap shot on its cover about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's girth, we had a nasty comment from the ever-thoughtful Sarah Palin suggesting Christie's weight was an issue because ""it's been extreme,"" and the party of Lincoln locked in a debate over whether one of its most successful governors was too tubby to be president. No one apparently remembers that William Howard Taft was not only America's only president to be so fat he got stuck in the White House bathtub, but he was also our only chief executive to go on to become the head of a second branch of government as the chief justice. Of course, I have to admit, Palin once again revealing her intellectual deficits while taking a shot at a fellow Republican's physical attributes is more entertaining than many new shows on television this fall (""Sean Saves the World"" and ""We Are Men"" come to mind), but her remarks are still otherwise without redeeming social value. So, let's take a collective chill pill, shall we? Let's admit that all we know about 2016 is that those of us lucky to make it that far will be three years older and that can't be good news for hairlines or waistlines. Let's admit that it is how the economy is doing, the state of the world and how we feel about outgoing President Barack Obama, and not carefully reasoned arguments by the people who gave us President Hillary Clinton in 2008 that will ultimately decide who the candidates are. Let's admit that being able to run against Washington will be an advantage, as it has been for every candidate since the 1970s, and that the candidate offering the most optimistic view of America's future is likely to win -- as he or she typically does. Let's admit that that probably means the Republican candidate will be a current or former governor. And finally, let's admit that sometimes just because the pundits say something is going to happen doesn't mean it isn't true. Which is why when all is said and done I still think Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee and the next President of the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Pundits cook up buzz that Elizabeth Warren may run against Hillary Clinton in 2016 .

"(CNN) -- Facebook is the fast food of the Internet: easy, quick, satisfying and requiring minimal effort. And the new Facebook Home smartphone interface is for people who live and breathe the social network above any other site or service, depending on it as a news source and communication hub. Facebook Home is a free Android app that makes some mild changes to a phone's lock screen and home screen to deliver more Facebook features. It's available now in the Google Play store for select Android phones and comes pre-installed on the new HTC First phone, which we have been testing out. Cover Feed . The most prominent feature of Facebook Home is the cover feed. The phone's lock screen displays a constant slideshow of friends' photos and updates that will glide by anytime the device is awake. You can like or comment on a status update or image directly from this screen, tap and hold to get a better look at photos, and swipe to flip through the updates going back in time. Even short statuses are given the full-screen treatment here, displayed on top of a grayed out timeline photo. Tap on the small profile picture for a friend to go straight to their timeline, or tap on a link to open whatever video or article your friend has posted. For people who habitually check Facebook on their phones, the cover feed combines time wasting with time saving. It's like having a TV constantly on in the background -- your friend's wedding photos, weather updates, political rants are turned into soothing white noise you can marginally pay attention to while doing other tasks. It's difficult not to constantly glance at the updates as they go by, an interesting photo catching your eye in the background anytime you check the time or get a text message or other notification. Unfortunately, that allure isn't limited to the phone's owner. Friends and family members were easily sucked in by my phone running Facebook Home, automatically picking up the device and flipping through the photos. Anytime your phone is visible and awake, say when you put it on the table at a business meeting or cafe, people can get a peek at your friend feed. This has the potential to get really awkward. Unlike your own carefully crafted timeline, the feed of content coming from all Facebook contacts isn't controlled. There are no settings to pick and choose whose updates show up, so alongside the cute baby and vacation photos from close friends are the uncomfortable drunken photos from a weekend birthday party, political rants from your uncle, weird viral photos you wish you could un-see. Another downside is that it is way too easy to accidentally like a status or photo, which can get embarrassing. There are no ads on the cover feed, but they will be added at some point. For many, any enjoyment that comes from seeing photos and statuses effortlessly play on the phone's screen could be negated as soon as an unwanted advertisement slips in. Home Screen . To escape the slideshow, use the tiny circle with your profile photo located at the bottom of the lock screen. Tap on your face and swipe it left to open Facebook Messenger and communicate with your friends through the social network, bypassing text messages or phone calls. Swipe right to open the most recently used app or up to go to the phone's main app screen where more Facebooking awaits. There is no place to swipe to take a photo or post a status update. Camera shortcuts are common on most smartphone lock screens, and it seems like a curious omission seeing as how most people are taking those photos just to put them on Facebook or Instagram. But its only one step away. The main app screen has three new buttons along the top for posting a status or photo or checking into a location on Facebook. Swipe left or right to see the usual selection of Android apps, which have suffered a bit of a demotion in the Facebook Home world. Chat Heads . The most clever and useful feature is Chat Heads, which will show Facebook messages from your friends (along with a bubble showing their profile photo) no matter what app you are using at the time. What makes the chat feature handy is that it doesn't require you to go to another app to respond. You can reply right there without having to leave Google Maps or whatever app you happen to be using, even move the bubble around so it's not blocking a certain part of the screen. Being able to chat away while doing other things is a huge time saver and hopefully something that will be adopted by other operating systems. You don't even need Facebook Home to get this feature. The company has rolled out an update for its Messenger Android app that adds Chat Heads, so you can multitask away on any Android phone. A new update to the iOS Facebook app also adds Chat Heads, but unfortunately it only works inside the app. These aren't revolutionary changes to the smartphone experience. For many it will be too simplified, too invasive, too annoying. But for a certain segment of Internet users it could be a no-brainer update. Facebook says is has over a billion active users, and that includes an extremely wide range of ages and levels of tech know-how. Smartphone users check the social network 14 times a day, according to a recent survey by IDC. There are many people who's Internet interactions revolve almost entirely around Facebook, which serves up their news and entertainment and acts as both an e-mail and chat program. For these Facebook-centric people, a smartphone that caters to how they use the Internet will the the most natural upgrade in the world.","Facebook Home turns Android devices into a tool for checking Facebook first .

"(CNN) -- A days-long outage for some Yahoo e-mail users is casting a dark shadow over a perceived turnaround at the once-mighty Internet player. Some users of Yahoo Mail, which underwent a major overhaul over the summer, were still without service Thursday from an outage that started late Monday. The downtime was due to ""a hardware problem in our of our mail data centers"" and proved ""harder to fix than we originally expected,"" Jeff Bonforte, who heads up e-mail services for Yahoo, said in a blog post. Late Wednesday, the company posted that the affected servers were up and running, but that it would take time to catch up on missed e-mails and that some users would still have trouble accessing their accounts. The post said it expected all lagged e-mails to be delivered by Thursday afternoon. CEO Marissa Mayer made revamping e-mail a part of her effort to kickstart a Web company that, in the eyes of many, had grown stale and was bleeding money. It's been a rocky process. Announced last December, the first e-mail overhaul rolled out to all users (whether they wanted it or not) in June. So lukewarm was the reception that it got a largely cosmetic redesign again in October. The result? More outrage. Under Mayer, Yahoo purchased Bonforte's company, Xobni, in July, and the former Yahoo staffer was put in charge of the redesign. But it's suffered from periodic outages since October, the latest being the most dramatic. Kara Swisher, of tech blog All Things Digital, wrote a scathing piece tackling recurring problems with Yahoo Mail and the company's response. ""While I am certain Bonforte -- for whom I have had great respect for a long time -- and his team are trying their best to fix the problem, the contrast to Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's insistence on engineering excellence and innovation and the inability of the company to provide a cogent explanation about what is happening to one of its most important daily interfaces with its customers could not be any more stark,"" she wrote. ""In other words: What could be bigger than a Fail Whale? This."" Rank-and-file users were no happier, based on social media posts about the outage. ""Update 10 hours old, account still not accessible by phone. Your 'help' said to reinstall it, but account not available for that,"" one Twitter user wrote to Yahoo's mail team account Thursday morning. ""A freakin nightmare; you guys work for Govt healthcare?"" wrote another. Since Mayer took over in June 2012, there have been signs of life at the company. Stock prices have jumped 130% as she orchestrated a logo redesign, several high-profile acquisitions -- most notably Tumblr -- and overhauls of apps, including e-mail. But Google and Facebook continue to chip away at Yahoo's biggest moneymaker, online advertising, and revenue has been flat. A black eye for something as simple as an e-mail outage, and a response viewed as lackluster by some, is the last thing a company on the rebound wants or needs. ""The issue isn't that Yahoo's webmail has gone down â€” in fact, from time to time it is to be expected,"" Lauren Hockenson wrote for tech blog GigaOM. ""But when one of a company's core services, especially the one that CEO Marissa Meyer identified as the linchpin to the success of Yahoo, experiences issues, users expect to be informed regularly.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of miles from raging Western wildfires, North Carolina lowered its flags to half-staff Tuesday to honor four crew members of a U.S. military firefighting plane who were killed in a weekend crash. The tanker crashed Sunday night in the Black Hills of South Dakota where it was dropping flame retardant on the White Draw Fire north of Edgemont, the U.S. Northern Command said. Six North Carolina National Guard members were aboard the C-130, part of an eight-plane fleet battling wildfires that have burned hundreds of thousands of acres. The four fatalities were National Guard members, said the National Interagency Coordination Center. They were identified as Lt. Col. Paul K. Mikeal, 42, of Mooresville, N.C.; Maj. Joseph M. McCormick, 36, of Belmont, N.C., Maj. Ryan S. David, 35, of Boone, N.C.; and Senior Master Sgt. Robert S. Cannon, 50, of Charlotte. The identities of the two survivors, who were in critical condition, were not released. The cause of the crash is under investigation. The military suspended its aerial firefighting operations after the crash to review flying and safety procedures, but said it was resuming operations Tuesday. On Saturday, a smiling Mikeal told reporters that he was looking forward to helping out in the effort to quell the growing fires. Colorado fire victim films her own evacuation . ""It's very exciting. Adrenaline is flowing,"" Mikeal said. ""We are ready to go. We have been watching the news and seeing everything that's going on out there. We have been waiting for the call."" A hospital official at South Dakota's Rapid City Regional Hospital said Monday that two other members of the crew were critically injured in the crash and identified one as Josh Marlowe. Marlowe deployed to Afghanistan three times and has an 8-week-old son, Marlowe's stepmother, Kim Marlowe, told WBTV. iReporters share views of the wildfires . Marlowe said her stepson's condition was improving. ""He fought in so many wars and it is my faith that I know that God brought him through all that and will bring him through this,"" she said. ""I just want him to know that I love him, and we're praying for him to come back home. I'm just asking for people to pray for him and families that weren't as fortunate.""

Firefighters reported more gains Monday, saying they had stopped the fires' growth and were working on putting out hot spots within its charred 17,920-acre footprint. A day later, the fire had not budged, said Tim Johnson, a public information officer with the interagency management team. ""That's still the acreage, and a containment of 70%,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""By the end of the day, I would expect that number to increase."" Of the 32,000 people who were evacuated, 30,000 will have been allowed to return home by 6 p.m. Tuesday, leaving 2,000 still shut out, he said. ""Sadly, about half of those, of course, are to homes that are no longer there."" The cost of fighting the fire has exceeded $12 million, he said, adding that estimates of the replacement cost for the homes destroyed exceed $103 million. In all, 1,581 personnel were fighting the fire, he said. The most destructive fire in state history, it killed two people, destroyed 346 homes and damaged dozens more.

"Washington (CNN) -- Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas cruise ship has rescued 23 Cubans found floating in a boat, the cruise line said. The cruise ship was on a seven-night voyage from Port Everglades, Florida, to Cozumel, Mexico. In waters south of Cuba, near the Cayman Islands, the ship encountered a small boat carrying 19 male and four female Cuban citizens Wednesday. The rescue was videotaped by passengers aboard the ship. Once the Cubans were on board, the Royal Caribbean crew gave them food, water and medical attention. A spokesman for the cruise line said none of the their injuries was serious, and the crew performed ""basic medical treatment."" The cruise liner alerted the U.S. Coast Guard, which advised the ship to continue to Cozumel and disembark all refugees in Mexico. The Coast Guard says that because the ship picked up the refugees outside of U.S. territorial waters, it requested that Oasis of the Seas turn over the group of Cubans at the ship's next port of call, which was Cozumel. One of the largest cruise ships sailing today, Oasis of the Seas has a capacity of almost 6,300 passengers and 2,200 crew members.","Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas was on a 7-night trip from Florida to Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors on Monday for the first time sought to link Washington Mayor Vincent Gray to campaign finance irregularities stemming from his successful 2010 bid as well as an effort to cover them up. The allegations were made during a hearing at which a local businessman, Jeffrey Thompson, pleaded guilty to conspiracy for masterminding a nearly $670,000 illegal ""shadow campaign"" for Gray in 2010, federal prosecutors said. Moreover, prosecutors publicly claimed Gray was aware of the illegal fundraising and had agreed with Thompson to cover it up. Thompson was expected to cooperate with the government and could receive a reduced sentence. Gray has not been charged with any wrongdoing. But his campaign has been the focus of a long-running federal investigation. Four of his top campaign aides as well as others have pleaded guilty to felonies related to the shadow campaign. The probe had clouded much of his lone term. With his eyes set on reelection this year, Gray has adamantly denied having anything to do with Thompson's activities and repeated that through his campaign manager on Monday. ""I have already responded to that again and again and again and again and again,"" Gray told CNN last year, ""I didn't do anything -- period."" His campaign manager, Chuck Thies, said Thomson is difficult to believe. ""Jeff Thompson has lied and conspired and manipulated elections and politicians and people for years. It is impossible to believe anything he says. His actions prove that he is not to be believed,"" Thies said. ""I think the voters in D.C. are smart enough to know that an admitted felon is difficult to believe. And when given the choice to believe Vince Gray or Jeff Thompson, that can be no choice,"" he said. Gray's challengers are now leveling allegations of cronyism and pay-to-play against Gray and have tried to make ethics are major aspect of the campaign. According to prosecutors, Thompson allegedly used the code name ""Uncle Earl"" when dealing with Gray. They alleged in court documents that Thompson, 58, used his companies to funnel millions of dollars in off-the-book contributions to various federal and city candidates. None of the candidates were identified by name in the charging documents, but prosecutors said in court Gray was a key recipient of the funds. Thompson and his unnamed co-conspirators allegedly disbursed ""approximately $668,800 in excessive and unreported corporate contributions to pay for campaign services and campaign materials in coordination with and in support of"" Gray's campaign, the papers said. Thompson was also charged with passing on more than $600,000 in unreported campaign contributions to a presidential candidate in 2008. ""In the Thompson charging documents, boilerplate language is used to describe all the campaigns that Thompson sought to illegally influence: (Hillary) Clinton's, Gray's and many others,"" said Thies. ""We urge the media to be cautious when reporting the facts of this case and avoid the innuendo that our political opponents will gladly promote as gospel,"" said Thies. ""Mayor Gray called for this investigation. Mayor Gray has always said he did not break any laws,"" he added. CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.","For first time, prosecutors say Mayor Vincent Gray knew about campaign finance irregularities .

"(CNN) -- When Dawie van der Walt said capturing the Nelson Mandela golf championship was ""special,"" you can believe him. He is South African, and his title came a day before the funeral of the country's first black president and former Nobel Peace Prize winner. Mandela died last week at the age of 95, with tournament officials then switching the dates of the event so it didn't conflict with the funeral. It was subsequently shortened to 54 holes due to persistent rain. ""Winning The Nelson Mandela at this time, when it's sad for everyone, everyone is mourning and tomorrow's the big day, it means a lot and it's something I can keep close to my heart forever,"" the world No. 337 told the European Tour's website. ""It's obviously really special, making you a part of history. ""I haven't been in that good form, I've been struggling with an injury, so this is almost overwhelming. To win the last event of the year is going to make Christmas a lot more fun."" Van der Walt won his first title in South Africa in March but slumped thereafter, missing the cut at the majority of his tournaments. He had to come from behind to ensure victory Saturday, leapfrogging England's Matthew Baldwin at the 12th hole in Durban following an eagle. Van der Walt registered a four-under 66 and finished at 15 under overall to beat Baldwin and Spain's Jorge Campillo -- the author of a 59 Friday -- by two shots.

"(CNN) -- A soccer presenter who made sexist remarks about a female match official resigned from Britain's Sky Sports on Wednesday, a day after the co-host with whom he made the remarks was fired by the network. Richard Keys, the commentator who resigned Wednesday, had been overheard disparaging assistant referee Sian Massey, saying women don't understand the offsides rule, in conversation with fellow commentator Andy Gray. Sky Sports terminated its contract with Gray on Tuesday, citing ""unacceptable and offensive behaviour."" ""I am deeply sorry for my remarks and the offence they have caused,"" Keys said in a statement Wednesday. ""It was wrong and should not have happened. I have thought long and hard and reached the decision that it is time to move on."" ""Going forward without Andy would have been almost impossible,"" Keys' statement continued. Massey made a controversial call on Saturday during a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton. A replay showed she was right. The offside rule limits attacking players from going past defenders when the ball is kicked and still being involved in play. ""It is disappointing that Richard's career at Sky should end in these circumstances,"" said Barney Francis, managing director of Sky Sports, in a Wednesday statement. ""However, Richard recognizes that his comments at the weekend were unacceptable."" Massey has been a referee at international matches -- the highest level of the sport -- since 2009, world soccer's governing body FIFA says. On Wednesday, Keys said in a radio interview with a British radio show that he had called Massey on Sunday to apologize on behalf of himself and Gray. ""I expressed my disappointment that Andy and I, in misguidedly having a little fun, had got it wrong,"" he said in an interview with the broadcaster TalkSport. ""There is no excuse anywhere for anybody to make a judgement on someone else's ability to do a job because they are male or female."" ""I made it an official apology, which Sian accepted,"" Keys said. ""She and I enjoyed some banter together and we left on very good terms."" Massey said he was prevented from disclosing the conversation with Massey, though he did not elaborate. In its Tuesday statement about firing Gray, Sky News said the move was made ""in response to new evidence of unacceptable and offensive behaviour... relating to an off-air incident that took place in December 2010."" The statement did not elaborate on the December incident. More than 800 women are qualified to be referees in England, the country's football association said Monday added, saying ""all of our female match officials act as fantastic ambassadors for the game.""","Richard Keys resigned from Britain's Sky Sports on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- ""The Artist"" beat out films from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and George Clooney to top honors at the Academy Awards on Sunday -- not bad for a silent, black-and-white French film with no big-name stars. Director Michel Hazanavicius's love letter to old Hollywood cinema was the undisputed king of the industry's biggest night, garnering five Oscars for best picture, best directing, best costume design, best original music score and best actor. But was the rise of ""The Artist"" from contender to best picture winner -- the first silent film to win the award since ""Wings"" at the first Academy Awards in 1929 -- a triumph of marketing over art? For many, the film's triumph at the Oscars was a foregone conclusion, the result of a marketing process set in motion months ago by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who snapped up the U.S. distribution rights before anyone at the Cannes film festival had a chance to swoon over the French film last year. ""There wasn't any doubt when it came to the top awards who the winners were going to be,"" Total Film deputy editor Jamie Graham told CNN. ""Harvey is the best in the business at getting that awards attention, and it became clear with 'The Artist' two months ago that this was the film that had caught the tailwind."" The mercurial movie promoter and co-founder of Miramax Films, credited for discovering ""Pulp Fiction"" director Quentin Tarantino and a string of commercial and critical successes including ""The English Patient,"" ""Shakespeare in Love"" and last year's ""The King's Speech,"" is famous for harnessing the momentum of his films at the right time and riding waves of publicity to wins at the podium and at the box office. No sooner had Jean Dujardin taken the top actor award for his portrayal of silent film star George Valentin at Cannes than Weinstein had the film's stars and directors hitting the award campaign circuit to capitalize on its surprise success. Best actor winner Dujardin walked red carpets around the world as other awards began to flood in. Co-stars Berenice Bejo and John Goodman plugged the film on CNN, and Uggie, the film's canine star, played dead and performed tricks from the film on major news channels on both sides of the Atlantic. ""People who don't play the game tend not to win at the Oscars,"" said Graham. ""You really have to press the flesh and hit the road, and for the last three months their lives would've been dedicated to that."" Empire magazine's Ian Nathan says that by the time the Golden Globe Award nominations came around, the race for Oscar glory had narrowed to a two-horse race between George Clooney's ""The Descendants"" and ""The Artist"" -- a race Weinstein's relentless campaign strategy began to win by the end of last year. ""Something about what Harvey managed to do -- getting these three very charming leads and the director out there, getting the dog out there, screening it to everyone who mattered, milking the nostalgia and old Hollywoodness of it -- lifted it from the competitor to the favorite long before the show came around,"" he told CNN. ""Once one film has a foothold -- once it's become the thing like 'The King's Speech' did last year -- then even Clooney can't compete,"" he said. Weinstein's strength, says Nathan, lies in his ability to catch a ""middle-brow"" film right before it becomes popular and turn it into the frontrunner. Nathan told CNN: ""He's very good at picking the middle-brow films... and the Oscars are a mainstream event which celebrates the best of the middle. Harvey's been a very wily player in that, and you have to give him that credit, he knows how to map that out over a year."" While ""The Artist"" has punched above its weight at the box office, tallying roughly $76 million in worldwide receipts so far (58% from outside the U.S.), the film didn't receive much of a box office bump following the announcement of Oscar nominations in January, according to Ian Nathan -- especially compared with ""The King's Speech,"" which raked in an estimated $415 million worldwide (66% from international) on its way to winning best picture, actor and director at the 2011 Academy Awards. ""It hasn't made the usual Oscar success money that the 'The King's Speech' did last year,"" said Nathan. ""It's a silent film with a French sensibility, and it's a tougher sell for audiences. But now that it's got all the attention in the world, can that translate to more money?"" While the money may not follow, Nathan says one thing seems certain -- after a relatively dry decade, the back-to-back successes of ""The King's Speech"" and ""The Artist"" means Harvey Weinstein is back in business. ""Harvey's come out of his fallow years as the guy to beat at the Oscars,"" he said. ""It's a bit of a second coming -- clearly he's still got a little bit of that magic.""","""The Artist"" won Academy Awards for best picture, best director, best actor .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In a further sign that China is edging ahead as the world's dominant space power, Wang Yaping -- the second Chinese woman in space -- gave a physics lesson to school children from zero gravity. Speaking through a video link from the Shenzhou-10 manned spacecraft to a class of middle school students in Beijing, Wang demonstrated the effects of zero gravity on water and a pendulum. The blue-clad astronaut also showed how she could push a fellow astronaut into the wall of the module with touch of her finger and gulped down the drop of water as it floated in mid-air. Mass audience . More than 60 million students across China watched the lecture on China's state broadcaster CCTV as Wang demonstrated Newton's second law of motion (force equals mass times acceleration) and the surface tension of water. Wang fielded questions from students that ranged from whether the team had seen any space junk or even UFOs, to the efficacy of weight scales in space. The demonstration drew a spirited response on social media in China, with comments on Weibo -- China's equivalent of Twitter -- ranging from enthusiastic support for the country's space program, to questioning the cost of the Shenzhou-10 program. ""The U.S. used to be proud of their space class, (but) now we've made it, too!"" one user posted. ""We should be proud of this. What others have, we have it too."" Experimental space station . China launched three astronauts into space on board the Shenzhou-10 craft last week to dock with Tiangong-1, an experimental space station used to test orbital rendezvous and docking capabilities. It is China's fifth manned mission to space in a decade. While the space station only has a two-year operational lifespan, the development of a permanent space station is part of Beijing's ambitious multi-billion dollar space plan, which is being hailed by the Communist Party as a symbol of China's growing technical expertise. China first sent a human into space in 2003 but is already planning to complete its space station by 2020, and sometime afterwards land a man on the moon. Despite the ambitious space program, China still lags Russia and the U.S. and is still attempting to reach milestones achieved by the two superpowers decades ago. Playing catch-up . Despite these limitations, China's Tiangong-1 space station is half the size of the first space station, Salyut 1, that the Soviets sent up in 1971 -- analysts say that China is able to take advantage of advances in spaceflight technology. ""What we have seen more than anything else is a truly long-term commitment to space that dates back at least 25 years, and a sustained interest during those 25 years,"" Dean Cheng of the Heritage Foundation, a policy research group in Washington DC, told the New Scientist. He said NASA's human spaceflight program has struggled under changing budgets and governments while the Chinese space program had seen ordered and incremental progress since the 1990s. ""So as long as the money holds out and political stability reigns, they might well get to some place like Mars or establish a lunar presence, precisely because they are persistent and willing to spend the money and make the effort,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- By 2023, hideously powerful technology companies like the Weyland Corporation will rule the world. At least that's the storyline in ""Prometheus,"" Ridley Scott's much-anticipated prequel to ""Aliens,"" which will be released next month. ""We can create cybernetic individuals who are indistinguishable from us,"" Peter Weyland, the hubristic CEO of the Weyland Corporation, boasts in a teaser for the film. ""We are the gods now."" While the roguish Weyland might be an invention, Scott's imaginary 2023 is no longer pure science fiction. Even today, big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Apple mimic ""the gods"" in their acquisition of vast wealth and power. Facebook, with its 900 million members (only India and China now have more residents), is on the brink of a $100-billion stock market launch that will be the largest in history. Co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees this as just the beginning of his company's transformation of the world. Zuckerberg, who Forbes ranked this year as the 9th most powerful person in the world, eventually wants to connect everybody -- all 8 billion human beings -- on the planet. And he wants Facebook to not only become the internet's operating system but also the platform upon which we do all our digital business. Google, meanwhile, has become so powerful that it is now investing many millions of dollars not only in futuristic projects like virtual reality glasses and self-driving cars, but it is also proposing to finance space ships designed to mine nearby asteroids that will supposedly ""add trillions of dollars to the global GDP."" Google has just got its first license to operate its self-driving cars, but will it need and apply for a similar license to finance the exploration of space in its pursuit of ""human progress?"" How long, I wonder, before Google also gets into the lucrative business of building robots (or ""cybernetic individuals,"" in the parlance of Weyland) which, one Silicon Valley utopian believes, should take all of our jobs in the future. Then there is Apple, the world's most valuable company, whose products are already beginning to be manufactured in Foxconn's Chinese factories by intelligent robots. Late last month, Apple's stock ""soared"" 10% after the Silicon Valley company announcing a record quarter in which it sold 35.1 million iPhones and earned an astonishing $39.2 billion in revenue. With its massive reserves of capital, Apple's value is now greater than the GDP of Poland. But even though it has amassed the power and influence of a mid-sized economy and could, if it wished, singlehandedly fix the European financial crisis, Apple, like Weyland, seems to have forsaken its social obligations. And so the disturbing vision of life in 2023 portrayed in ""Prometheus"" might not be quite as fictional as we would like. While Apple, Google and Facebook might be evolving into the Weyland Corporation in terms of their godly wealth and power, these companies aren't returning much of their fortune back to society. Google, for example, could soon be the subject of EU and US anti-trust investigations to determine if it is stymieing competition by illegally leveraging the vast power of its technologies and services -- a claim it denies. Last month, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission released a disturbing report revealing there was an organized program within to Google to harvest private data such as user emails and passwords. Facebook, meanwhile, has been playing an endless game of cat and mouse with members over its public use of their data. With products like ""Timeline"" and ""Open Graph,"" Zuckerberg appears determined to erode privacy and package users as data products that add value to his corporation. ""You have only one identity,"" Zuckerberg once said. And, I'm afraid, the 27-year-old multi-billionaire wants to own each of our identities so that Facebook can become the dominant company of our big data age. Then there is big tech's not-so-little tax problem. Taking advantage of industrial-age tax codes, these multinational giants are leveraging the digital realities of today's global economy to run rings around local tax collectors. Since May 2010, The New York Times reports, the technology companies listed in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index â€” a list of 71 leviathans including Apple, Google, Yahoo and Dell â€” paid worldwide cash taxes at a rate that, on average, was a third less than companies from other industries. Apple insists it pays substantial taxes, but in a world still mostly deeply mired in recession, fiscal crisis and high unemployment, its sophisticated accounting practices are, to say the least, troubling. Read Apple's response on its tax practices here . ""Even among tech companies, Apple's rates are low,"" The New York Times notes in an article that spotlights the company's strategy of sidestepping some taxes. From setting up central offices in low tax havens such as Nevada, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands, to its use of a complex tax structure known as ""The Double Irish,"" Apple has relentlessly exploited legal tax loopholes. While I can't exactly tell you how the movie ""Prometheus"" ends, I can confidently predict an unhappy real world ending if companies like Facebook, Google and Apple continue to amass such unnatural power and wealth. Harvesting asteroids, creating a radically transparent virtual world state and replacing workers with intelligent robots are all very well, but unless our big tech companies recognize their social responsibilities, I fear that our real future could be as disturbing as the science fictional one presented in Ridley Scott's blockbuster. â€¢ Follow @ajkeen on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Affectionately known in his home city of Madrid as ""the wise man of Hortaleza,"" Luis Aragones left the legacy of helping Spain's ascension to the top of world football. Aragones, whose death at the age of 75 was announced Saturday, coached his national side to the European Championship title in 2008 -- the country's first success at a major tournament in more than 40 years. That breakthrough was continued by his successor Vicente del Bosque, who continued with the ""tiki taka"" passing style Aragones introduced, as ""La Roja"" won the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European crown. ""Without a doubt, he marked the road in this final successful phase. I felt a great deal of appreciation towards him,"" Del Bosque told the national team's official website. ""I knew he had some health problems, but I never imagined it would lead to this."" ""Always with us, Luis,"" led the website tribute of Atletico Madrid, the club where Aragones played for a decade between 1964-74 and was head coach on four occasions, most recently 2001-03. He guided Atletico to the La Liga title in 1977 and the Spanish Cup on three occasions. ""Luis Aragones was a great player and coach, but before all that a great person and a friend,"" said the team's president Enrique Cerezo. ""First and foremost he was Atletico. We want to express on behalf of the whole club our condolences to his family."" Aragones' final coaching job was with Turkish side Fenerbahce, which ended in mid-2009, and late last year he announced his retirement from the game -- in which he started out at Getafe in 1957. He was reportedly taken to a Madrid hospital last week with a serious illness, from which he did not recover. Aragones will be buried at a private ceremony on Sunday. Atletico will observe a minute's silence ahead of the home match against Real Sociedad, in which the team will seek to go top of the table above another of his former teams, Barcelona. ""I wish to express our sorrow at the loss of one of football's greatest men and one of the most charismatic and likeable managers we remember,"" Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu said before his side's 3-2 defeat by Valencia -- its first at home in the league since April 2012. ""As a club, we had the honor of his services, albeit for a very short time, in the 1987-88 season, when we won the Spanish Cup. ""We much appreciate his respect for Barca, its model and our players. Euro 2008, with Puyol, Xavi, Iniesta and so many others, is a great example."" Aragones' appreciation of Barca's ""tiki taka"" style -- started by Johann Cruyff and developed by Pep Guardiola -- was borne out by the number of the players from the Catalan club he selected for the national team. But his heart lay in the nation's capital, where he was on the books of Atletico's big rival Real Madrid from 1958-60 as a player -- though he spent most of that time out on loan to other clubs. ""The loss of Luis Aragones saddens all of us who love football,"" said Real president Florentino Perez. ""Today is a day of mourning for this sport, but it should also be a day of recognition for a legendary figure who was vital in giving us a glorious period with our Spanish national team. ""He ennobled this sport and all Spanish fans owe him gratitude and respect. His personal and professional career was always characterized by honesty and hard work."" The only blot on his international career was an incident in 2004, when he was accused of making a racial comment -- which was caught on television cameras -- about France striker Thierry Henry while he was trying to motivate his players in training ahead of a World Cup qualifying match. Aragones was fined by European football's ruling body UEFA and subsequently apologized to Henry, insisting he had not intended to make a racial insult.","Former Spain national coach Luis Aragones passes away in Madrid on Saturday .

"Ascot, England (CNN) -- It wasn't his flashiest performance, but Frankel made sure his final race was also his most dramatic as he overhauled French rival Cirrus des Aigles to maintain his unbeaten record and cap a remarkable three-year career at the summit of his sport. The English thoroughbred has looked increasingly settled on his last few appearances at the track. However, on this occasion he was almost too relaxed. Caught napping at the start, Frankel appeared to stumble out of the blocks, losing lengths on Cirrus des Aigles and Natheniel, who took up the early lead in the rain-softened ground. It meant that Frankel become detached from his brother and pacemaker Bullet Train, who was meanwhile being held up by jockey Ian Mongan in order to bring his more talented brother back into the race. The early blunder left jockey Tom Queally with a dilemma -- either kick on to catch up with the leaders, or settle Frankel in towards the back of the field and hope his sheer class would prevail. Infographic: What makes Frankel so special? Queally picked the latter course of action, and his faith in the great colt was rewarded when, taking a wide line off the final bend, he asked Frankel for an extra gear. The red-hot favorite powered through the field to close the gap on Cirrus des Aigles, officially the second-best horse in the world, with Nathaniel already beaten. Frankel then blazed towards the winning post with a length and three-quarters to spare. Queally admitted that Frankel had found the softer going a challenge, saying he had lacked his customary bounce on the canter down to the start. But when asked to deliver, ""the 4x4 kicked in,"" the jockey said. ""It just shows what kind of an animal we're dealing with,"" added Queally, who described Frankel as the ""best ever."" As had been widely expected, Frankel's owner, Khalid Abdullah confirmed that the wonder horse had run his last race. ""He's given so much pleasure to so many people,"" his racing manager, Teddy Grimthorpe, told journalists. ""He's been a champion at two, three and four. He's the master of his profession,"" Grimthorpe added. Frankel will now be retired to stud, where he has been conservatively valued at Â£100 million ($160 million) as a stallion.","British thoroughbred wins Champion Stakes at Ascot to maintain unbeaten record .

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department is looking at whether to launch an investigation of finger-pointing between the CIA and the Senate Intelligence Committee that erupted over access to top-secret documents, a law enforcement source told CNN. Earlier this week, the CIA's Inspector General's office asked prosecutors to look at allegations from both sides that each was inappropriately monitoring the other at a secret facility in Northern Virginia. The facility was set up to review millions of classified CIA documents on its detention and interrogation programs. The CIA outfitted the room with secure computers and encrypted locks so committee staff members could compile a 6,000 page classified report. The CIA contends the committee was looking at unauthorized material, while the Senate panel claims the agency inappropriately monitored computer activity of its staff, according to a source familiar with the matter. CIA Director John Brennan said in a statement that that he was ""deeply dismayed"" that some members of the Senate have made ""spurious allegations about CIA actions that are wholly unsupported by the facts."" Brennan said he was confident that authorities reviewing the matter would determine whether there was any wrongdoing by either side.","Justice Department weighing whether to get involved .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan has authorized passenger airlines to resume flights of Boeing 787 Dreamliners in the country starting Friday, authorities said. The move follows the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's online posting Thursday of a directive outlining the modifications necessary for the Dreamliner to fly again after faulty battery systems grounded the aircraft earlier this year. The directive goes into effect upon publication Friday in the U.S. Federal Register. The Japanese transport ministry said All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines, the world's two largest Dreamliner operators, have already begun installing modified lithium ion batteries on their 787 jets. But it remains unclear precisely when the two airlines will resume scheduled passenger flights of the Boeing planes. Nearly 50 Dreamliners around the world have been grounded for more than three months, after two incidents on jets operated by the Japanese airlines called the battery systems into question. Last week, the FAA cleared Boeing to make fixes to the problematic battery system. Boeing said it was deploying teams to help the airlines install the redesigned system. The Dreamliner's use of lightweight composite materials to greatly improve fuel economy has made it a big seller in Asia and the Middle East, where long-haul flights account for much of an airline's business.

"(CNN) -- Police in the metropolitan Chicago village of Robbins, Illinois, said they are investigating an incident in which a man is believed to have shot and killed his wife and two of her children before also dying. A third child told Robbins police that his stepfather shot his mother, brother and sister. The suspect, Michael Worsham, was found dead in the home where the shootings took place late Sunday. Police said the cause of death was undetermined. The three others all suffered gunshot wounds, according to police. The 14-year-old boy also said he attempted to wrestle the gun away from his stepfather, who told him he could leave if he stopped fighting. The teen then grabbed his 5-year-old nephew and ran to a friend's house. Robbins is in Cook County, about 20 miles south-southwest of downtown Chicago.

"(CNN) -- President Obama delivered his State of the Union address and said -- again -- that this is the year he intends to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. As President, he has promised this before, first in his inaugural address in January 2009 and then periodically reiterated over the years. As I write this, I am en route to the prison that Amnesty International once dubbed the ""Guantanamo Gulag."" One might quibble over the term, but the profile of the place is extraordinary. When I first went there in 2004, I expected to find ""the worst of the worst"" terrorists in the world, as then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had promised. Instead, I was hard-pressed to find people who were America's enemies. The Pentagon has effectively conceded this -- 624 men have long since been set free, and 77 of the remaining 155 men have been cleared for release for at least four years, some for much longer. The majority of my clients have been cleared for release by the Obama administration's 2009 Task Force, which requires unanimous agreement by no fewer than 6 federal agencies including the FBI, the CIA, and the Departments of Defense and State. There can be no other prison in the world where 50 percent of the inmates are told: ""You are cleared to leave, but you cannot go."" I hope to visit five of my remaining clients, although some may not come to the meeting. All are depressed and (for the questionable privilege of seeing me) had to endure for a time what the military dubbed a ""scrotum search"" -- an intentionally humiliating exploration of the genital area, which is intended to deter prisoners from coming to a legal visit to complain about the conditions. One person who will come out is Shaker Aamer, the last British resident there. Shaker does not like what he had to endure, but he told me recently that the procedure was ultimately more humiliating for the soldiers who must carry out such benighted orders. After all, who joined the proud U.S. military in order to become a ""Scrotum Searcher, First Class?"" He has been cleared since 2007, and hopes that it will not be too long before he can return to London, finally, to meet his youngest son Faris, who was born on the day Shaker arrived at Guantanamo Bay: Valentine's Day 2002. Shaker is depressed. The President's broken promises have weighed heavily on all the detainees. As anyone can understand, it is easier to endure the certainty of abuse than to oscillate between hope and despair. The President is correct when he argues that Guantanamo is a recruiting sergeant for extremism. He is right to say that America loses credibility, and inspires disdain, when we fail to adhere to our principles. The President is also justified when he blames the Republicans for undermining his pledge to erase the blot of Guantanamo from the reputation of this country. However, President Obama is arguably the most powerful person on the planet and his team should not promote the myth that the cleared prisoners cannot be set free -- Shaker could join his wife and four children in London tomorrow; those of us who have worked on the issue for 12 years can help ensure the smooth repatriation of others to their own homes and families. Equally to the point, the most powerful man on Earth could tell the military to stop humiliating prisoners who want to talk to their lawyers, and to end the violent and torturous practice of force-feeding those who peacefully protest their indefinite detention by hunger-striking. Over a 30-year career, I have visited most of the major prisons across the U.S. South, institutions that house death row or a maximum security unit, and none treats the prisoners as badly as Shaker suffers in Guantanamo Bay. The President could also advise me what I am meant to say next week, when my clients inevitably ask me -- as they always do -- why they are still being held despite the multiple findings that they pose no threat and can be transferred out of the hell they are living daily. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clive Stafford Smith.","An attorney for 14 men in Guantanamo Bay says Obama's broken promises have weighed heavily on all the detainees .

"(CNN) -- One of the few mysteries to have light shed on it in the search for a missing Malaysia Airlines airliner has been the case of two passengers who boarded the flight with stolen passports. The news that two Flight 370 passengers were not who they claimed to be -- and had used stolen documents -- immediately raised speculation about foul play. Authorities have not ruled out terrorism, but at least where it concerns these two passengers, early evidence indicates they were, foremost, Iranian migrants. Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble identified the two as Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18, and Delavar Syed Mohammad Reza, 29. He said they entered Malaysia using valid Iranian passports, but they used stolen Austrian and Italian passports to board Flight 370. It is not uncommon for Iranians to go to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia, Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch, told CNN. After the violent 2009-2010 election protests in Iran, many Iranians fled for Malaysia, where Middle Easterners, in most cases, can travel without a visa, Robertson said. ""A significant number of asylum-seekers from Iran did end up in Malaysia,"" he said. Acquiring stolen or altered passports, ""unfortunately, is much easier than most people would think,"" and quite common, Robertson said. A European passport would be a great advantage for a migrant wanting to leave Southeast Asia. Authorities say the passports -- one Austrian, the other Italian -- were stolen in Thailand, which is a known hub of the stolen passport industry. ""Thailand remains a robust venue for the sale of high-quality false passports (including altered stolen passports) and other supporting documentation,"" said Paul Quaglia, who has been working in the region as a security and risk analyst for 14 years. According to Thai police, an Iranian man by the name of Kazem Ali bought one-way tickets for the two men, describing them as friends who wanted to return home to Europe. While Ali made the initial booking by telephone, either Ali or someone acting on his behalf paid for the tickets in cash, according to police. Interpol's Noble said the evidence in the case of the stolen passports points to a concern quite different from terrorism: ""If you read what the head of Malaysia police said recently, about [Nourmohammadi] ... wanting to travel to Frankfurt, Germany, to be with his mother,"" he said, ""[this] is part of a human smuggling issue and not a terrorist issue,"" Noble said. Human smuggling, which usually is linked to abuses such as forced labor or sex slavery, is a problem in Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries. The suggestion is not that Reza and Nourmohammadi were being exploited, but that there exists in Malaysia a criminal infrastructure for smuggling people.","Malaysia is a favored destination for people fleeing Iran .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. economy exceeded forecasters' expectations in February, adding 175,000 new positions. This is a welcome jump from the paltry 75,000 jobs gained in December and 113,000 in January -- which had constituted the weakest back-to-back monthly figures in three years -- but the unemployment rate edged up to 6.7%. And we are still far off pace for the recovery federal officials would like to see as they scale back a massive bond-buying program. The fact is there is a fundamental shift underway that we must address to get the economy humming again: the steady substitution of human labor with computers. More companies are mechanizing positions traditionally reserved for flesh-and-blood workers. Low-cost software is replacing blue- and white-collar jobs alike. A recent study by Oxford University researchers projected that up to 45% of U.S. jobs could be replaced by computers within the next two decades. America needs to adapt to this shift, or these lackluster job gains are going to become the new normal. And there is no better place to start than our schools. The fact is American teens are falling behind in key subjects that will prepare them for the new age of computing. In the most recent global education assessment, America's 15-year-olds scored below the international average in math and about average in science and reading. Furthermore, many of the specific skills our kids are learning in school today won't prepare them at all for the professional world they'll enter. Our schools need to change. And there is a clear strategy for how to do it. But first, the essence of the challenge. The first wave of professional technologies replaced physical laborers -- car production lines, for instance, evolved from a series of Bobs and Joes with specific technical proficiencies to just a handful of hyper-efficient assembly bots. Today, processors and software have grown so sophisticated that they can replicate core cognitive functions once thought to be the exclusive domain of humans. You can now hire computers to do your taxes and trade stocks. And these replacement technologies usually operate at much lower cost and higher reliability than their brain-ware competitors. MIT scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have been particularly perceptive in formulating strategies for how Americans can adapt to this seismic shift in the labor market. They note it's futile to try to outcompete; the flip side of the John Henry legend is that humans will eventually lose any direct competition with machines. Instead, they point to a teamwork model exemplified in competitive chess. About a decade ago, programs like Deep Blue started beating the top grandmasters on a regular basis. In response, there emerged what's called ""freestyle"" chess, which pairs a human and computer together -- the machine crunches the numbers and the person consults on broader strategy. It turns out that freestyle teams -- even when they include a mediocre human player -- can beat the top computers and grandmasters. This pairing synthesizes what each partner does best for a more complete chess strategy. The key lesson here is that American workers need to be trained to complement the raw processing and networking power of computers with uniquely human facilities, like evaluating subtle social cues and crafting macro strategies. Workers should use their wetware to amplify the software. This insight has clear implications for how to reform our schools so they can better prepare students for the new age of computing. First, classroom learning needs to shift focus from the accumulation of particular facts and figures -- How many countries are in Europe? When did Columbus arrive in America? -- to a broader emphasis on flexible analytical thinking and strategizing. After all, most Americans already have instant access to the sum total of human knowledge in the phone in their pocket. What will distinguish the workers of the future is an ability to harness, filter and synthesize all that data. Second, computers need to play a more central role in all learning. Young people need to feel comfortable using machines to meet a wide variety of educational ends. Third, schools need to teach entrepreneurship. Seeing business opportunities and then executing on them is a skill. It can be learned like geology and history. Young people need to be encouraged to take a critical eye to the world around them, find the inefficiencies and then problem-solve their way to potential solutions. Don't get me wrong: personality will be a key differentiator between machines and people for the foreseeable future. There will always be a role for the best-in-class customer service-orientated people with great personalities who can instantly establish an emotional connection to their customers. But the new age of computing is deeply disrupting the American labor market. By training the next generation of American workers how to complement -- not compete with -- these fabulous new technologies, our schools can ensure this country will flourish for decades to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Adam Lewis.","Adam Lewis: Jobs up last month; but this conceals reality about changing job picture .
He says U.S. must adapt to major ongoing shift of replacing human jobs with computers .
He says U.S.'s lagging schools must focus on flexible thinking, computers, entrepreneurship .

"(CNN) -- In a reversal of its past position, a majority of a 26-person Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted Thursday to recommend looser restrictions on the controversial diabetes drug Avandia. Thirteen members voted to modify the current restrictions, while another seven voted to remove them altogether. Five members voted to continue the restrictions without changes, while one voted to remove Avandia from the market. The decision whether to act on the recommendation now lies with FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg. In 2010, the FDA restricted Avandia use to patients with type 2 diabetes who could not control their illness with other medications. The decision was based on studies showing an increased risk of serious heart problems in patients taking Avandia, most notably a 2007 analysis by Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, showing a 43% increase in heart attacks. The finding led the FDA to order GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the drug's maker, to conduct a thorough study of its safety. The full results of that study -- known as RECORD -- were made public in 2009. While GSK said the safety data was reassuring, the study was heavily criticized by Dr. Thomas Marciniak, an FDA scientist who reviewed the data and said GSK ignored several cases of patients who suffered severe adverse effects. Makers of diabetes drug will pay $90 million . Because there were multiple, conflicting signals of cardiovascular risk associated with the drug, Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of CDER, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, recommended GSK commission an outside, independent group to review RECORD's results. GSK chose the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) to re-examine the data. It was the results of the DCRI review that prompted this latest two-day hearing. DCRI's associate director, Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey, said DCRI performed a comprehensive review and its data was consistent with GSK's initial trial results. Some members of the FDA panel questioned the severity of the current restrictions and the scope of cardiovascular events caused by taking the drug. ""I am considerably reassured ... that the magnitude of risk is not great,"" said Dr. Dale Hammerschmidt, one of the panelists who voted to modify the warning. He added he thought the current warning was more severe than necessary, but should not be removed entirely. GSK said it will continue to work with the FDA as the panel's recommendation is considered. ""We continue to believe that Avandia is a safe and effective treatment option for type 2 diabetes when used for the appropriate patient and in accordance with labeling,"" said Dr. James Shannon, GSK's chief medical officer. Currently, only 3,000 patients in the United States are registered to take Avandia, according to GSK spokeswoman Mary Ann Rhyne. That's compared to the 120,000 patients taking the drug in 2010 before the restrictions were put in place. CNN's Saundra Young contributed to this report.","Restrictions on Avandia use were put in place in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of last week's tragedy in Newtown, I have been asked a million questions about gun control. I've seen pictures of the weapon the killer used. I've heard stories about the number of bullets in the clip and the number of guns in his mother's home. I've even heard politicians argue that school officials should be armed with semiautomatic weapons. I've also heard about mental health. We should be careful not to blame the mentally ill for all crimes. But we should also be prepared to accept that we might be able to prevent some tragedies if we did a better job of caring for them. I've seen mental health illness in children, and our system is ill-equipped to handle it. I've seen families struggle with it. One of my greatest frustrations with clinical practice is that there are far too many times when I lack the tools necessary to care for children who need help. It's relatively easy to cure an infection or an acute physical ailment. It's so much harder to take a mental health issue. There are rarely pills that will do the job. Even when they are, they almost never work perfectly to eradicate the problem. Opinion: On gun control, two places to start . Studies show that more than 10% of children in the United States might benefit from some sort of mental health treatment. Most don't get it. We often don't have the research to tell us how best to care for these problems. Even when we do, we often lack the capacity. There is a shortage of resources and services available to serve children. Furthermore, even when those resources exist, a lack of coordination often prevents they're being used effectively. It doesn't help that the upcoming fiscal cliff will likely cut National Institutes of Health research funding by $2.4 billion. That would mean 2,300 fewer grants in the coming year, which represents about 25% of grants that might otherwise be offered. It doesn't help that we keep talking about cuts to services such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which cover the health care for about one in every three children in the United States. If a child is actively suicidal or homicidal, an emergency room can spring into action and admit him or her for inpatient care. But that's often all inpatient care will do. Once a child is no longer actively threatening harm to himself or others, he or she will be released. That's what the hospital system does. It cares for the acute problem, leaving the long term, and often much harder, work to a system ill-equipped to handle it. Opinion: Mourn ... and take action on guns . It's natural to try and blame poor parenting when kids don't turn out as well as we'd hope. And, certainly, in many instances such parenting can lead to a misbehaving child, or even a child we don't necessarily like. But mental illness really does exist, and a lot of it can't be cured by good parenting and isn't caused by bad parenting. We don't have a good system for dealing with it. I want to stress that I don't think that all violence is associated with mental illness. In fact, it's quite the opposite. But the problems with guns and injuries go so far beyond school shootings, and a lot of that is amenable to a more focused health care system. Opinion: Predicting mass killings impossible . One of the things I do as a pediatrician is ""anticipatory guidance."" We ask questions about issues that have not yet occurred but might occur in the future. A lot of anticipatory guidance focuses on injury prevention. We might ask about bike helmets, or swimming, or fire alarms in the house. I even ask about guns in the home. I don't ask this question because I'm eager to lecture patients or parents on the morality of owning guns, or the rights of individuals under the Second Amendment. I'm asking because I'm trying to prevent injury or death. The No. 3 killer of children age 10-14 is suicide; the fourth is homicide. The No. 2 killer of children age 15-19 is homicide; No. 3 is suicide. Opinion: In school shootings, patterns and warning signs . I have been trained to ask parents if they have a gun in the home. If they do, I ask how it's stored. I strongly recommend that they keep it unloaded, locked up, and that they store the bullets separately. I do this because guns are part of almost 85% of homicides and more than 45% of suicides in kids 5 to 19 years old. This doesn't even account for injuries not resulting in death. Yet recent laws have attempted to stop pediatricians from doing even this. I don't know what the best outcome is from a tragedy like this. I imagine much of the focus will be on banning the weapon used or on limiting the number of bullets that could be fired without reloading. I think that's somewhat missing the point. The vast majority of injuries or deaths due to guns are carried out on a small scale. While what happened in Newtown is a horrific occurrence, it represents the exception, not the norm, with respect to gun violence in the United States. While I welcome the opportunity for us to address the problem, I hope we focus on how we might best help all our children, not just those who make the national news.

"(CNN) -- In one image, soldiers -- including one from the Wisconsin Army National Guard -- pose around a flag-draped casket. The caption reads: ""We put the FUN in funeral -- your fearless honor guard from various states."" In another, a soldier poses alone in a car. That caption reads: ""It's so damn cold out ... WHY have a funeral outside!? Somebody's getting a jacked up flag."" Both photographs sparked outrage after they were posted on an Instagram account belonging to Spc. Terry Harrison -- a member of the 1st Battalion, 147th Aviation Regiment based in Madison, Wisconsin. She has been suspended indefinitely from the funeral honors detail, pending an investigation. Harrison remains working full time, performing other duties, said Maj. Paul Rickert, spokesman for the Wisconsin National Guard. On Wednesday, a second Wisconsin National Guard member was also suspended with pay from the funeral honor team, Rickert said. During the suspension, Sgt. Luis Jimenez has been assigned to other duties pending the outcome of the investigation, Rickert said. ""He had made comments on social media supporting Spc. Terry Harrison. He's not featured in any of the photos,"" Rickert said. Jimenez couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. ""A military funeral is the final show of respect for our veterans and their families, and we take that solemn duty very seriously,"" Rickert said. ""The very name 'military funeral honors' underscores the importance we ascribe -- both as the military and society at large -- to such solemn occasions. These photos and comments do not appear to align with those values."" Harrison is the only member of the Wisconsin National Guard in the photos, the spokesman added. The other people are members of other military units, but Rickert didn't know to which branches or units they might belong. As a result, he didn't know whether there were other investigations involving those members. ""We expect all of our Soldiers and Airmen to live by a core set of values, in word and deed,"" said Maj. Gen. Donald P. Dunbar, Wisconsin's adjutant general. ""I was appalled by the offensive photos and comments that appeared on this Soldier's social media site regarding her duties as a funeral honor guard member.""","NEW: Sgt.

"London (CNN) -- The illegal wildlife trade takes the lives of 100 elephants a day, and rhino poaching increased by 5,000% between 2007 and 2012. The six remaining subspecies of tiger are endangered, two of them critically. Three other tiger subspecies are already extinct. Statistics like these are the reason it's time to treat the effort to stop the illegal wildlife trade ""like a battle, because it is precisely that,"" says Britain's Prince Charles. He and his son, Prince William, are among the high-profile global guests due to take part in the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade on Thursday, hosted by the UK government. Prince William also will attend talks hosted by the Zoological Society of London and a reception at London's Natural History Museum on Wednesday. Charles and William released a nine-minute video message Sunday calling for the world to act. ""We have come together, as father and son, to lend our voices to the growing global effort to combat the illegal wildlife trade -- a trade that has reached such unprecedented levels of killing and related violence that it now poses a grave threat not only to the survival of some of the world's most treasured species, but also to economic and political stability in many areas around the world,"" says Charles. William says he and his father are optimistic the ""tide can be reversed."" ""We have to be the generation that stopped the illegal wildlife trade, and secured the future of these magnificent animals, and their habitats, for if we fail, it will be too late,"" the younger prince adds. William, whose wife Catherine gave birth to their son George last summer, said that since becoming a father he has become ""even more devoted to protecting the resources of the Earth for not only my own son but also the other children of his generation to enjoy."" The video, which was recorded in November, ends with the pair saying the phrase ""Let's unite for wildlife!"" in Arabic, Vietnamese, Swahili, Spanish and Mandarin. The aim is to be understood by as many people as possible living in the countries most affected by the illegal wildlife trade. China and Vietnam are key markets for illegal animal products, such as bones, skin and tusks. William, who has been a patron since 2005 of the wildlife conservation charity Tusk Trust, faced criticism Saturday in UK newspaper The Sun for reportedly going on a boar hunting trip to Spain with his brother, Prince Harry. ""Prince William has gone shooting -- a day before launching a campaign to stop wildlife being killed,"" the popular tabloid said. Horn 'worth more than gold and platinum' Prince Charles, UK Prime Minister David Cameron and the Presidents of Botswana and Gabon are due to speak at the conference Thursday. The Presidents of Tanzania and Chad are also expected to be present. The UK government says illegal ivory trade activity worldwide has more than doubled since 2007, with ivory selling for up to 1,200 pounds ($1,968) per kilogram. ""Rhino horn is now worth more than gold and platinum and is more valuable on the black market than diamonds or cocaine,"" a statement on the UK government website says. With such lucrative profits to be made, criminals are eager to get in on the action. In 2006, only 60 African rhinos were poached, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The number has steadily increased to an estimated 1,000-plus in 2013. One out of 13 elephants in Africa was killed illegally in 2012, according to the Zoological Society of London. South Africa arrested more than 340 poachers last year -- but poachers sometimes fight back, making the work of park rangers dangerous. At least 1,000 park rangers have been killed in the past decade, the UK government says. Prince Charles said poachers make use of the kind of sophisticated weaponry used in warfare, hence his call to treat the fight against them like a battle. The wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic argues that as long as demand for illegal wildlife products remains, criminals will seek to exploit it. ""Law enforcement efforts must continue to be at the front line in the battle to protect species in their range countries and in efforts to shut down markets for illegal wildlife products,"" said the network's director of policy, Sabri Zain. ""However, without a complementary effort to effectively address the persistent market demand that drives this trade, enforcement action alone may sometimes be futile."" CNN's Richard Allen Greene and David Wilkinson contributed to this report.","Prince Charles and Prince William speak out against illegal wildlife trade .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- At least 11 construction workers were killed Tuesday when a big cement beam fell on them in a Bangkok suburb, at the site where they were working, Thai police said. About 27 workers were on their lunch break -- some of them eating, others just resting -- in the district of Bangpli when the beam fell on them, said police Lt. Col. Somchai Piakhan. More than a dozen injured people have been transported to nearby hospitals, and at least one worker is still trapped inside the rubble, police said. A rescue team is trying to lift the wreckage of cement and steel to free anybody trapped underneath, authorities said. Sniffer dogs have also been deployed to find possible survivors. The collapse took place around noon at the construction site of a new hospital. Bangpli is southeast of Bangkok, in Samut Prakarn province. CNN's Kocha Olarn reported from Bangkok, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","A cement beam falls on construction workers during their lunch break, police say .

"(CNN) -- If Manchester United were hoping to escape their domestic troubles in Europe then the English Premier League champions only found more tragedy in Greece. Olympiakos swept aside a lackluster United side 2-0 to see the two-time Champions League winners on the verge of an exit in the last 16. The hard-working Alejandro Dominguez deflected in the ball with a deft back heel after 38 minutes to cue frenzied excitement among the red-and-white-hued home fans. A brilliant, second goal from Joel Campbell -- on loan to the Greek champions from Arsenal -- sealed United's fate in the second half. Even with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie spearheading their attack, United lacked attacking verve. Van Persie's best chance came in the final 10 minutes of the match when the Dutchman found himself clear on goal but skied the ball over the crossbar. United have already been knocked out of both domestic cup competitions and, in the league, trail 15 points behind leaders Chelsea in sixth position. Europe offers Moyes his only chance of redemption in a difficult transitional season since Alex Ferguson's retirement. The Manchester United malaise is uncomfortably setting in and the team have an uphill battle to overturn a tenacious Greek side in the return leg at Old Trafford on March 19. Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick told Sky Sports: ""Everyone's having a dig and enjoying it -- we've got to take it on the chin and bounce back."" In Tuesday's early game, last season's Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund won a lively tie with Zenit St Petersburg. The German side had strolled to an early 2-0 lead as Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marco Reus scored within 70 seconds of each other in the opening five minutes. Zenit, featuring in the last 16 for only the second time, breathed new life into the match when Oleg Shatov made the most of a melee in the Dortmund box to score when the ball bounced back off the post. The crowd at the Petrovsky Stadium roared but, minutes later, Robert Lewandowski bobbled the ball beyond the Zenit keeper to stretch the scoreline to 3-1. Zenit were given a second chance when the referee awarded a penalty after Viktor Faizulin clumsily went down inside the area. Brazil striker Hulk muscled Zenit back into contention as he whipped the ball into the net; a cool strike considering he'd missed his last three penalties. But the Russian defense buckled once more and Poland striker Lewandowski, who is joining Borussia's rivals Bayern Munich at the end of the season, stroked in a diagonal cross. Borussia will take a 4-2 lead back for the home leg as Jurgen Klopp's team, just like Manchester United, hope to seek solace from a dismal domestic campaign in the glittering realms of the Champions League.","Manchester United beaten 2-0 by Olympiakos in Champions League last 16 .

"(Mental Floss) -- News outlets reported this week that legendary broadcaster Walter Cronkite never amended his will to include Joanna Simon, who had been his girlfriend for the last four years of his life. Cronkite's daughter said the newsman never planned to leave Simon, a former opera singer and older sister of Carly Simon, any sort of inheritance, but either way, wills are back in the news. Leona Helmsley left her dog Trouble $12 million dollars in her will. What better time to look at some of the most bizarre codicils ever written? 1. Leona Helmsley . The notoriously egomaniacal hotelier famously left $12 million to her Maltese, Trouble, while entirely cutting two of her grandchildren out of her will (for ""reasons which are known to them""). Her other two grandchildren didn't get off the hook entirely; their inheritances were contingent upon their regularly making visits to their father's grave, where they would have to sign a registration book to prove they had shown up. 2. Carlotta Liebenstein . Don't think Trouble Helmsley is the richest pooch on the block. When Liebenstein, a German countess, died in 1991, she left her entire $80-million estate to her dog, Gunther. 3. Jeremy Bentham . The 18th-and-19th-century social philosopher left the world a rather odd bequest in his will: his preserved, clothed body. No one's quite sure what Bentham was getting at with this ""gift,"" but since his 1832 death his clothed skeleton -- topped with a wax model of Bentham's head -- has been preserved in a wood-and-glass cabinet known as the Auto-Icon. It now resides at University College London and is occasionally moved so Bentham can ""attend"" meetings. Bentham didn't want for the Auto-Icon to feature a wax head; he actually carried around the glass eyes he wanted used in his preserved face for years before his death. However, the preservation process distorted his face, so the wax replica had to stand in. For many years Bentham's real head sat between his feet in the Auto-Icon, but it was such a target for pranksters that it eventually had to be locked away. Mental Floss: 10 things your body can do after you die . 4. Sandra West . West, a California socialite and oil heiress, died when she was just 37 years old and requested that she be buried ""in my lace nightgown ... in my Ferrari, with the seat slanted comfortably."" Her family buried West in her powder-blue 1964 Ferrari 330 America, then covered the car with cement to deter car thieves. Good call: nice examples of that year's 330 America can now sell for well over $300,000. 5. Luis Carlos de Noronha Cabral da Camara . The Portuguese aristocrat was a childless bachelor, so he divvied up his estate by picking 70 names at random from the Lisbon phone book in 1988. When he died 13 years later, his attorneys notified the unsuspecting beneficiaries that they stood to inherit their benefactor's cash, his home, and his car. 6. Charles Millar . The Canadian attorney died a childless bachelor, but he left $568,106 to the mother who gave birth to the most children in Toronto in the 10 years following his 1928 death. This bequest prompted what Canadians called ""the Baby Derby"" as mothers raced to win the fortune. Finally, in 1938 four winners split the prize after giving birth to nine babies apiece. Mental Floss: Names you probably shouldn't give your kid . 7. Heinrich Heine . The German poet left his entire fortune to his wife, but with one catch: she had to remarry ""because then there will be at least one man to regret my death."" 8. S. Sanborn . Sanborn, a 19th-century New England hatter, left a rather macabre bequest to a friend -- a pair of drums made from Sanborn's skin. The friend received further instructions to go to Bunker Hill each June 17th and play ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" on the drums. 9. T.M. Zink . Zink, an Iowa lawyer who died in 1930, must have had some pretty bad experiences with women. When he died he left his daughter a measly five bucks, and his wife got nothing. He stipulated that the rest of his $100,000 estate be put in a trust for 75 years, then used to create the Zink Womanless Library. The library would have no feminine decorations, no books or magazine articles by female authors, and was required to have ""No Women Admitted"" carved into the stone over the entrance. 10. Robert Louis Stevenson . When the celebrated author died, he left his friend Annie H. Ide his birthday. Ide had previously complained to Stevenson about the inconvenience of being born on Christmas, so the writer left her November 13th as a new birthday provided she take care of it with ""moderation and humanity... the said birthday not being so young as it once was."" 11. Henry Budd . It's not clear how he originally made 200,000 pounds, but when Henry Budd died in 1862, he left his substantial fortune to his two sons on the condition that neither sullied his lip with a mustache. 12. Mark Gruenwald . When longtime comic book writer and editor Mark Gruenwald died in 1996, fans of the Marvel Comics icon probably thought they'd seen the last of the former Captain America writer. Gruenwald had other ideas, though. He requested that his ashes be mixed into the ink used to print the first trade paperback anthology of Squadron Supreme, another one of his landmark creations.

"Miami (CNN) -- Celebrity chef Paula Deen drew a standing ovation from a crowd of several hundred people Sunday in Miami Beach as she made her fourth public appearance since a controversy over her admitted use of a racial epithet in the past. ""We have come off a hard summer ... my family and my partners ... and I want to take a moment to apologize to those of you who didn't hear me. I hope you see us bring back good memories for you,"" an emotional Deen told the crowd at the prestigious South Beach Wine and Food Festival. Looking thinner than she has in the past and appearing overjoyed by the exuberant reception, Deen said she used her months out of the spotlight to spend a lot of quality time with her grandchildren. While Deen was preparing one of her famous dumpling dishes, she invited celebrity chef Robert Irvine to the stage, and Irvine then jokingly said to her ""you apologized. You've eaten crow. Just don't do it anymore."" Irvine then added, ""It's so good to have you back. This family is the best on the planet."" Deen told the audience that it was their cards and letters that helped her during and after the controversy, even personally thanking a young man in the audience from New Jersey who mailed her inspirational Bible verses. Deen's career and public reputation went into a tailspin in June after her deposition in a lawsuit brought by a former restaurant employee was released. In the videotaped deposition, Deen admitted using the ""N word"" in the past. Dean apologized publicly several times, but the efforts failed to suppress the controversy. In the media firestorm that followed, Deen lost lucrative endorsements and her Food Network cooking show, while the publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook was canceled. In late August, a federal judge approved a deal dismissing the lawsuit, which leveled accusations of racism and sexual harassment. The lawsuit was dismissed ""with prejudice,"" meaning it cannot be filed again, according to a court filing. Two weeks ago, it was announced that a new business partnership was created with private-content and consumer distribution company Najafi Media. Najafi said it intends to rebuild and grow her business, Paula Deen Ventures. Najami is investing $75 million into Paula Deen Ventures. Known as ""the Queen of Southern cuisine,"" Deen has sold over 8 million copies of her 14 cookbooks and is supported by one of the largest social media followings for any well-known chef. Through her representative, Deen said that attending the South Beach event this year, as she has for almost a decade, was like a homecoming for her. Deen also said she was grateful for having the opportunity of helping the festival raise millions of dollars for Florida International University's Chaplin School of Hospitality and Tourism Management.","Paula Deen makes her fourth public appearance since controversy last year .

"(CNN) -- E-P-I-C. S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G. C-O-M-P-E-T-I-T-I-O-N. Two Missouri students went more than 60 rounds Saturday in a spelling bee that had to be called because organizers ran out of words. The battle was between Sophia Hoffman, a fifth-grader at Highland Park Elementary, and Kush Sharma, a seventh-grader at Frontier School of Innovation. It was held at the Plaza Branch of the Kansas City Public Library. ""We didn't want to just go through the dictionary and give them more words. We feared that someone would get a word that was too easy while the other would get an extremely difficult word. We wanted to be a bit more calculated and neutral, and we wanted to give each an equal opportunity,"" said Mary Olive Thompson, outreach coordinator for Kansas City Public Library. The original pool of 25 students was quickly whittled to just Sophia and Kush. The two will go head to head again next month for a spot in the Scripps National Spelling Bee. The program provides a list of words for contests across the country. Sophia and Kush burned through that list, as well as 20 other words organizers picked from the dictionary when they realized it was possible they might need more words, Thompson said. ""The officials were fatigued. The kids weren't tired. They had endless energy and were doing an amazing job,"" she added. Kush can't remember exactly what word was the hardest for him to spell -- something French that started with an ""R."" He told CNN he will work hard for the rematch and would study every free minute of the day if he scores a place in the national bee. ""I'm looking forward to seeing how far Sophia can push me and how far my skills can go,"" he said. For Sophia, the most difficult word was schadenfreude, which describes the enjoyment one can get from someone else's bad luck. She knows how to spell the word, but she apparently doesn't feel it. ""Kush worked really hard. I wish we could both go (to the national competition),"" Sophia said.

"(CNN) -- The retro, rounded TV icon was one of the first to grace the iPhone's screen when the device was released in 2007. Now, for the first time, new iPhones will no longer include the YouTube app by default. But YouTube has already whipped up a replacement. On Tuesday, YouTube released its own app for the iPhone. The release comes just one month after Apple publicly confirmed it would no longer include the popular video-site's app on the upcoming version of its mobile operating system, iOS 6. Being a pre-installed, native app on iPhones and iPads has given YouTube instant access to a fast-growing segment of users -- YouTube gets 1 billion mobile views each day across all platforms, and mobile now makes up 25% of all YouTube views. Check out the world's hottest smartphones . But the deal with Apple has not been without its drawbacks. Because the app was built by Apple and baked into the iOS mobile operating system, YouTube had limited control over what it could change and control in the app. Perhaps most importantly, it couldn't show videos with ads because Apple didn't allow it. This new app gives control back to YouTube, but at a cost. To avoid hemorrhaging iPhone users who upgrade to iOS 6, or who buy a new phone with the new operating system pre-installed, the company must convince iPhone owners to stick with YouTube either by downloading the new app or visiting the mobile version of YouTube.com. How smartphones make us superhuman . When the news of Apple dropping the YouTube app came out in August, it was seen as the latest sign of strife between Apple and Google, which owns YouTube. In June, Apple announced it would no longer use Google Maps to power the iPhone and iPad's Maps app, and Apple has been taking on makers of Android-powered smartphones in courts around the world over patent disputes. The removal of YouTube was considered the latest attempt by Apple to extricate itself from Google's products and services. YouTube is playing down the adversarial plot line. ""Apple and us have been working very closely on this one,"" Andrey Doronichev, YouTube's lead mobile product manager, told CNN. ""[This] was the right thing to do from both companies' standpoint. User experience is so much better."" The news wasn't a complete surprise to YouTube -- Doronichev said his team spent ""months"" working on the app, which means they began before the split became public. Doronichev gave us a tour of the app, which is available for free in the App Store as of Tuesday. The app can be downloaded on iPhones running iOS 4.3 or later. Visually, the new interface is vast improvement over the old version, which had begun to look dated after years of minimal updates. The design has been overhauled and now looks much more like the Android YouTube app, with a hidden navigation panel on the left and a number of new discovery and sharing options. Thanks to the unblocking of videos with ads, the new app has access to ""tens of thousands"" of videos that weren't available in the old app, such as official music videos. The search tool has features familiar to users of other Google iOS apps, including auto-suggestions and voice searches. The app is more than just a repackaged take on the mobile site, and has features not possible on that HTML 5 version of YouTube, including overlays that can be used to show close captioned videos. The most welcome new feature for multi-taskers is in-page playback. You can continuously watch a video in vertical orientation while reading the video description, leaving comments, giving the video a thumbs up or down, and checking out a list of suggested videos. The video even keeps playing when you bring up the navigation menu. The YouTube team hopes these improvements will push iPhone users to do something they haven't had to do before for YouTube: download the app from Apple's App Store. The separation with Apple may decrease the number of iPhone users for a time, but it has made a vastly improved YouTube app possible. And because it is now offered through the app store, the company can continue to offer updates and roll out new features at a much faster pace. The announcement comes just one day before a much-anticipated Apple press conference, at which that company is expected to unveil its latest iPhone.","Apple will no longer include a YouTube app by default in new versions of its mobile operating system .

While it may temporarily lose users, YouTube gains back control over its apps design and features ."
"(CNN) -- Freestyle skier Jeret ""Speedy"" Peterson, who won a silver medal at the 2010 Winter Games, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police in Utah said. The Unified Police Department of Greater Salt Lake responded to a 911 call from Peterson, 29, on Monday night, said Lt. Justin Hoyal. Peterson told police he was going to take his life and said he was in Lambs Canyon, off Interstate 80 between Salt Lake City and Park City, Hoyal told CNN. Officers found him deceased there at about 9:30 p.m. (11:30 p.m. ET), he said. CNN affiliate KSL-TV in Salt Lake City reported Peterson also left a suicide note in his car. In 2010, Peterson told an CNN iReporter in Vancouver, Canada, the cheers he received when receiving the silver medal in men's aerials ""was one of the coolest feelings in the world."" He had competed in two previous Winter Games. According to a biography on the United States Ski and Snowboard Association website, Peterson picked up the nickname ""Speedy"" at a summer ski camp in Lake Placid, New York, in the mid-1990s because coaches thought he resembled the cartoon character ""Speed Racer"" with a big helmet. He won the 1999 U.S. Junior Championship and took bronze at two straight World Junior Championships in 2000 and 2001. But Peterson also knew struggles, both in skiing and in his personal life. His signature jump was called the ""Hurricane,"" which he failed to land in Torino, Italy, during the 2006 Winter Games, dropping him from third to seventh. The next day, Peterson was sent home after a post-party fight, according to the biography. His sister was killed by a drunk driver in 1987, and a close friend committed suicide in 2005 in front of Peterson, shooting himself in the head as Peterson was walking in the door, Sports Illustrated reported in a 2005 article. As a child growing up in Idaho, Peterson was sexually abused by someone he would not name, Sports Illustrated said. In 2002, the magazine wrote, he spoke about the experience at a fundraiser for an organization aimed at child abuse prevention, telling a young audience, ""If you think you deserved it, I promise it wasn't your fault. I know because I've lived that feeling for a long time."" Sports Illustrated in 2005: Peterson's inner demons . Peterson was arrested in Hailey, Idaho, early Friday on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, CNN affiliate KTVB in Boise, Idaho, reported. Hailey police told KTVB that Peterson was driving more than 70 mph in a 25-mph zone, and failed a field sobriety test. He was booked into jail and posted bail a few hours later, the station reported. Members of the U.S. Olympic Committee mourned Peterson's passing. ""I know Speedy's friends and family were incredibly proud of his effort in Vancouver, and his achievements were an inspiration to people all over the world,"" said committee chief executive Scott Blackmun. ""The personal challenges Speedy has battled are familiar to all of us, and on behalf of the U.S. Olympic Committee, I'd like to offer my sympathy to Speedy's family and friends.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- The backstage gossip at recent fashion shows wouldn't be complete without rampant speculation about who is likely to replace esteemed American Vogue Editor in Chief Anna Wintour. Vogue editors Anna Wintour and Carine Roitfeld at AmfAR's 10th Annual New York Gala in January 2008. Wintour has yet to announce any plans to retire but her advancing age -- she's 60 this year -- has stoked speculation that after more than 20 years in the role it might be time to leave. One name touted as a possible replacement is Carine Roitfeld, the highly respected editor in chief of Vogue Paris. Read more about Carine Roitfeld . Roitfeld is accustomed to the speculation, describing it as ""frustrating."" She told CNN she hadn't been offered the job and even if she was she probably wouldn't take it. ""It's a bit like for an actor. Do you want to go to Hollywood or do you want to stay here in Paris and do the cinema I like to do?,"" Roitfeld said. ""I think I prefer to stay here in Paris."" Watch Carine Roitfeld Revealed . A fixture at the U.S. title since 1988, Wintour has a fearsome reputation, mostly courtesy of the 2006 film starring Meryl Streep, ""The Devil Wears Prada."" The film is based on a book penned by a former assistant at American Vogue who has denied suggestions Wintour was the inspiration for the demanding and odious lead character. Roitfeld is anxious not to create any friction between her and her U.S. counterpart, telling CNN ""I think Anna does a great job... I think she's a great person."" She said she would be honored to be asked to fill Wintour's shoes, but pointed out that ""it's a very different job."" ""I'm very happy at French Vogue to be able to do everything -- almost everything -- I want in the magazine,"" she said. ""It would be too political at American Vogue for me. And I'm not sure I'm talking enough good English to work there."" At Vogue Paris, Roitfeld knows her readers. They are a select group of incredibly stylish and wealthy women who are thrilled rather than alienated by unconventional ideas. The best-selling edition so far, in August 2003, featured French actress Sophie Marceau on the cover smoking a cigarette. At French Vogue, there's less pressure to appeal to the masses. Its circulation of some 139,000 is dwarfed by the million plus readers of American Vogue. Fashion shoots are about fantasy. There's no imperative to make any clothes they feature wearable. If it's unusual and innovative, then it's in. With just 25 staff, Roitfeld describes the team at French Vogue as like a family. And that's how she prefers it. Having said that, she told CNN she wouldn't dismiss any offer out of hand. ""Of course I would consider it because it would be ridiculous not to consider such a huge position -- in terms of money and in terms of power,"" she said. ""But I'm very happy. It's very much a small team (in Paris). America is a huge team. I know because I've worked for them before. I think it's not for me.""","Style icon Anna Wintour is rumored to be leaving American Vogue in 2009 .

In an attempt to tackle the popularity of new-generation synthetic party drugs -- sold widely in convenience stores and blamed for triggering a spate of mental health issues -- New Zealand authorities have taken a radical new tack. A new law shifts the onus to the makers of synthetic recreational drugs, forcing them to conduct clinical tests to prove their products are safe -- similar to the way pharmaceuticals are regulated. It's the first nation to take a dramatically different approach to psychoactive substances like party pills and synthetic marijuana -- which the United Nations has flagged as an alarming drug problem. Some psychoactive substances go by names like bath salts, spice or meow-meow. In a 119-to-1 vote on Thursday, the country's parliament passed the Psychoactive Substances Bill, establishing a framework for testing, manufacturing and selling such recreational drugs. The new law does not apply to non-synthetic drugs like marijuana, cocaine or magic mushrooms. In a country that prides itself as a ""social laboratory,"" New Zealand has become ""a laboratory in every sense: for the approval of new recreational drugs,"" according to an editorial in the New Zealand Herald. The drug law enjoyed broad support although there was debate over whether animal testing would be required in the clinical tests. ""While other countries are still blindly banning drug after drug, the Psychoactive Substances Bill will put New Zealand ahead of the industry's game,"" said Ross Bell, the New Zealand Drug Foundation's executive director in a statement in support of the law. ""It is a comprehensive, pragmatic and innovative approach to address a complex problem."" This contrasts with countries where substances are legal until the governments ban them. Chemical concoctions come out fairly routinely -- far outpacing efforts to control them. When one product is banned, ""there are two or three or four replacements in the market,"" said Bell. And authorities can't prevent the drug makers from selling new concoctions. ""You can't ban what yet doesn't exist,"" Bell said. ""The government isn't in the position to pre-empt these things."" New Zealand is unique because of its remote geography, he added. ""It's because we're a small remote country,"" he said. ""Drugs like heroine don't make their way to New Zealand. What we've become good at doing is making our own drugs."" Psychoactive substances have raised concerns over their ingredients and effects. Some are known to cause paranoia, hallucinations, convulsions and psychotic episodes. ""In lots of ways, this synthetic cannabis is way worse than the real stuff with a number of people who are becoming psychotic as a result,"" said Dr. Mark Peterson, the chair of the New Zealand Medical Association. Under the law, new psychoactive drugs cannot be sold unless they pass health regulations. That process will be determined by the country's Ministry of Health. The new regulation ""has to be rigorous and robust enough to stand up to public scrutiny. To be licensed, to be legal, it has to pass testing like new medicine in the market,"" said Grant Hall, general manager of the advocacy group, The Star Trust, which represents members of the legal high industry in the country. The industry wants to ""be recognized as other highs"" such as alcohol and tobacco, he added. Hall said he expects the industry to take a hit on profits as they'll now have to submit costly and lengthy applications to be be sold on the market. But he views it as an investment. ""You have take a long term view,"" Hall said. ""It's a legitimate industry that provides certified low-risk product so people can enjoy them safely. That's a much better business model than the better cat-and-mouse game the industry plays with the government."" Here is what else the Psychoactive Substances Bill entails: . - Restricts where and how psychoactive drugs are sold . - Prohibits sales to minors . - Restricts labeling and packaging of products . - Gives existing products a grace period to begin application process .","New Zealand Parliament passes new drug law 119-1 .
Recreational drug makers can sell products if they prove its safety .
Law only applies to synthetic drugs, not marijuana, cocaine, etc .
New Zealand is first to change its tactic on psychoactive drugs ."
