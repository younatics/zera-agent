"Miuccua Prada is being investigated over allegations her company moved assets abroad in order to avoid tax . The chairwoman of Prada is facing an investigation after it was alleged the company avoided nearly £400million in tax by transferring services abroad. Miuccia Prada, 64, whose grandfather founded the luxury label, allegedly transferred the seat of the label to holding companies abroad, to avoid paying around £390million (€470million) to the Italian authorities. The Milan-based company is famous for its fine leather handbags and is a favourite with celebrities such as Sienna Miller and Kate Middleton. Company chairman Miuccia Prada, Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli and accountant Marco Salomoni have all been named in the prosecutors probe into alleged undeclared or false tax claims. The transfer of Prada Holding, the controlling shareholder of the house, to the Netherlands and notorious tax haven Luxembourg, was purely to ensure the company a more favourable taxation, Italian Inland Revenue allege, newspaper Corriere della Sera reported. At the end of last month, Prada agreed with the tax authorities to return its seat to Italy and pay backdated tax, claiming that it wanted ‘to invest in Italy’ to help the economic recovery. Mr Bertelli said: ‘We are very pleased to have taken this strategic decision, consistent with our desire to invest on Italy.' Milan prosecutors started investigating a . few days ago when they were notified by the taxman that the . luxury-goods company disclosed undeclared taxable income. Supporting economy: The fashion house has now moved its HQ back to Italy and claims it will repay all backdated tax in order to 'invest in' the country . Lawyers for Milan-based Prada said the company wasn’t aware of a probe by Italian authorities and that documents regarding the allegations have been submitted to prosecutors. 'As it stands we are not aware of there being an investigation,' Stefano Simontacchi and Guido Alleva said in an e-mailed statement. 'In any case, the new rules which are expected to enter into force regarding voluntary disclosure should be considered applicable to the present case, thereby leading to decriminalisation,' the lawyers said. The investigation follows efforts to clamp down on tax avoidance in Italy, after experts revealed that an estimated £90billion a year was lost in undeclared revenues. Last July, the two designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were sentenced to one year and eight months in prison for non-declaration of income.","Miuccia Prada, 64, named on court papers filed by Italian taxman .

"Closure has been given to hundreds of American families by a 'professional adventurer' who has dedicated years to tracking down planes which went missing in the Himalayas during the Second World War. One missing pilot was James Browne, 21, who disappeared over the mountainous jungle region known as 'The Hump' on November 17, 1942. His fellow pilot Captain John Dean, a veteran of the legendary Flying Tigers, and a Chinese crewman went down with him in the C-47. Hunting for heroes: More than 700 planes went down in the Himalayas 'sky way to hell' during the Second World War . Final resting place: The wing of a C-109 bulk fuel transport plane appears out of the dense jungle. This plane went down over the Hump on July 17, 1945 . Officer Browne, from Winnetka, Chicago, was never heard from again and for more than 70 years his family only knew he was 'missing in action'. The American pilots who flew the 'Skyway to Hell' to bring supplies to China as it battled Japan were renowned as a fearless bunch. During the Second World War, Japan’s Imperial Army has surrounded China’s seaports and eastern plains. The only way for Allied troops to receive supplies was with the efforts of heroic pilots who risked their lives crossing the rugged Himalayan mountain range. Man on a mission: Professional adventurer Clayton Kuhles, 58, has spent $100,000 of his own money traveling to the mountainous region to search for MIA pilots . They often flew for 20 hours straight in decrepit planes in 200mph winds under constant threat from Japanese enemy aircraft. The search for missing planes has been undertaken by 'professional adventurer' Clayton Kuhles, from Arizona, who has spent $100,000 making it his goal to find crash sites of the missing airmen. It has been estimated that more that 700 planes are scattered across 'The Hump'. Mr Kuhles, 58, travels each year to the region which stretches from  northeastern India, over Burma and into western China. Risking it all: The American pilots flew over the treacherous mountain jungle to bring supplies to Allied troops in China . Courage under fire: The Zoot Chute, with its distinctive Flying Tiger painted teeth, was one of the lucky planes that survived countless missions over the Hump . The explorer has so far found 22 crash sites and accounted for 193 missing U.S. airmen - including Officer Browne. His cousin, Bob Willett, now 85, described his aunt and uncle's anguish that their son was never found during the war. Mr Willett told Fox: 'They expected him to walk in the back door one day and resume his life and be their son again.' Never came home: The family of Officer James Browne from Winnetka, Chicago, finally know what happened to him after 70 years listed as MIA . Mr Willett never got over the loss of the elder cousin he idolised and joined the China National Aviation Corp. Association - a group of veteran pilots who had once flown the infamous Hump. He met Mr Kuhles in 2005 and told him about his cousin and what the family believed had happened. The adventurer told him he could help. Using the last transmission from the plane's radio, Mr Kuhles managed to pinpoint Cangshan Mountain in Burma as the most likely crash site. After making three separate trips and with only the help of a 17-year-old local guide, Kuhles finally made it through a near-impenetrable wall of bamboo to find the plane at 14,000 feet. He said: 'It was like stepping into an ancient Egyptian (pyramid). 'I knew it was the plane I was looking for. Finally, Dean and the others would have a chance to come home.' Kuhles explained that he doesn't have the means to bring home the air crafts that he finds. He often brings home possessions such as dog tags of pilots for the families but not human remains because of strict laws banning the transportation. However for Mr Willett, the knowledge of his cousin's final resting place, he said, was enough.","Clayton Kuhles has spent $100,000 of his own money to find missing pilots from the 'Flying Tigers'

"'Critical': Marussia test driver Maria De Villota has lost an eye in the wake of her horrific crash at Duxford Airfield . The female Formula One driver who survived a horrific head-on crash at a British airfield has lost her right eye in the wake of the accident, it was revealed today. Marussia test driver Maria De Villota is described as being in a 'critical but . stable' condition after undergoing considerable overnight surgery at . Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Team principal John Booth said: 'Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident. 'We are grateful for the medical . attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to . thank the neurological and plastics surgical teams. 'However, it is with great sadness I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye.' De Villota, who joined Marussia as . test driver in March, was taking part in her first test for the team, a . straight-line aero at the old Second World War site. The 32-year-old Spaniard had just . completed her initial installation run when her car ran into the . tailgate of a support truck at around 20-30mph, which was at such a . height to inflict the head trauma. Initially her injuries were described . as 'life-threatening' by an ambulance service spokesman, only for more . encouraging statements to follow later on as De Villota was reported to . be conscious. Marussia have now confirmed, however, surgery began yesterday afternoon, with De Villota in theatre until this morning. Booth added: 'Maria's care and the . wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are . at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them. 'We ask for everyone's patience and understanding with regard to updates on Maria's condition. Scroll down for video . What happened? Maria de Villota slows her Marussia MR01 down as she approaches the team's makeshift pit area . Problem: Seconds later the car takes off, avoids a crowd of mechanics and crashes into her team's lorry . Horrific: The car was wedged under the lorry's loading bay. Miss de Villota suffered head injuries . 'We will provide further information when it is appropriate to do so and with consideration for her family. 'In the meantime, we would all like to take this opportunity to praise the emergency services at Duxford Airfield, who were on stand-by yesterday, as is usual procedure for a Formula One test. 'Finally, we have been overwhelmed by messages of support for Maria, her family and the team and we would like to express our sincere gratitude for those.' Early theories behind the accident have suggested the anti-stall mechanism on the car kicked in as she approached a makeshift pit area, suddenly propelling her into the truck. Booth has confirmed investigations into the accident are ongoing, adding: 'We have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment.' Witnesses said De Villota's helmet and the front of her Marussia MR01 car took the bulk of the impact. Maria De Villota at a photo call this morning, . and in the Marussia car at Duxford Airfield, Cambridgeshire, shortly . before the accident . Her injuries were originally feared to . be life threatening but Miss de Villota is now in a stable condition in . hospital and has been able to speak to her family on the phone. The crash happened yesterday morning . at Duxford Aerodrome in Cambridgeshire, which is home to the Imperial . War Museum's aircraft collection. Doubts . have been raised about the MR01 model which had to have corrective work . after it failed a safety test in February. Yesterday was the first time . Miss de Villota had tried it out. Something seemed amiss with the car . before it hit the lorry, according to Chris Mann, a BBC Radio . Cambridgeshire presenter who witnessed the accident. Emergency workers and Marussia F1 staff at the scene at Duxford today . Racing in the blood: De Villota is the daughter of former Formula One driver Emilio De Villota . The 32-year-old Spaniard was taken to Addenbrooke's hospital . Marussia's race regulars are German driver Timo Glock (above), who missed the last Grand Prix in Valencia through illness, and Frenchman Charles Pic . 'She got into the car, fired it up and did a test run at probably about 200mph in the rain,' he said. 'The . car was slightly misfiring but there didn't seem to be any concerns. 'She came back into the area we were in with the engineers. She slowed . down but then suddenly, inexplicably, accelerated through the crowd and . smashed into the side of the truck.' Mr Mann's son, Nick, said it was a miracle none of the Marussia mechanics near the lorry was mown down. De Villota was given a test drive by Renault in August last year when she clocked up just under 200 miles . Miss . de Villota, whose father Emilio was a F1 driver in the 1980s, was . scheduled to spend two days doing straight-line tests on Duxford's . 1,312-yard runway. She was pulling in for mechanics to inspect the car . in the makeshift pit area when it took off and crashed at around 40mph. It has been suggested that the anti-stall mechanism on her car kicked in and propelled her forward. 'There . was a sort of board down, like a loading board, and the car went . careering into the side of that,' Mr Mann said. 'The top of her car and . her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it.' Miss de Villota remained motionless for around 15 minutes while paramedics treated her. She . was seen to move her hands before being transported by air ambulance to . Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge with serious head and facial . injuries. F1 drivers spoke of their shock at hearing news of the crash. Jenson . Button wrote on Twitter: 'Terrible accident for Maria de Villota, . Marussia F1 team test driver. 'My thoughts are with Maria and her . family.' Spain's Fernando Alonso said: 'We called the family and hopefully we will know more soon. All my energy with you!' After racing in Spanish F3, the Daytona 24 Hours, the Euroseries 3000 and Superleague Formula Championship, Miss de Villota was appointed test driver of Marussia in March. Test drivers help the team develop cars without taking part in races. Since Miss de Villota's appointment another woman, Britain's Suzie Wolff, has been given a similar role at rivals Williams. Russian-owned Marussia, which is based in Banbury, Oxfordshire, has taken over the Virgin Racing team of Sir Richard Branson. Last night a spokesman said: 'Maria is conscious and medical assessments are ongoing.' Discussing how she compares to male . drivers, Miss de Villota has said: 'While I have great respect for them, . I do not see an uneven playing field. 'Physically I have to work harder, . but as an athlete and a driver I feel that with proper training and . with the experience that I need, I think I can do it very well.' Her brother Emilio Jr is also a racing driver. Maria de Villota poses ahead of the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park in Melbourne . Born: January 13, 1980 in Madrid, Spain.

"It was Dr Johnson, that most sympathetic observer of human weakness, who said of his friend, the dramatist Oliver Goldsmith: ‘No man was more foolish when he had not a pen in his hand, nor more wise when he had.’ This morning, therefore, offer a kind thought for Kevin Pietersen, who was once an England cricketer. With a bat in his hand he achieved remarkable things. With a pen he fools nobody but himself. And after the ECB document about last winter’s disastrous Ashes tour was leaked on Tuesday, Pietersen looks very foolish indeed. In case you haven’t heard, Pietersen has just published an autobiography which seeks to ‘blow the lid’ off cricket, in particular the people he used to play with before they tired of him. Pietersen's autobiography was written with the purpose of blowing the lid off cricket . The former England international did that, but he has also damaged his already soiled reputation beyond repair . 2009: Resigns as England captain after a rift with coach Peter Moores . 2010: Fined for an obscene Twitter outburst after being dropped from ODI squad . 2012: Sends provocative texts about Andrew Strauss to Proteas . 2012: Reintegrated into team after missing out on a central contract . 2014: Sacked after ECB lose patience with his Ashes tour behaviour . He has blown the lid off all right, but at the expense of damaging his own reputation, already soiled, beyond repair. Even Matt Prior, the England wicketkeeper who feels the full force of Pietersen’s fury, may decide that pity is the most appropriate response. For what the book confirms is the self-willed fall from grace of a cricketer who had the world at his feet yet never learned to show a straighter bat to that world, and who may now be wondering why so many people share Andrew Strauss’s unprintable opinion of his character. Pietersen’s model for his book seems to be Alice In Wonderland, where words mean what Alice wants them to mean. The world, viewed through the filter of Pietersen’s imagination, is full of little men who were put on earth to halt his progress towards immortality. Pietersen (left) was all smiles during an England training session with Andrew Strauss in August 2011 . What has made cricket-followers roar is Pietersen’s confession that in 2012, a summer disfigured by his betrayal of Strauss, who was then a much-admired England captain, he blubbed in the dressing-room at Headingley after he had made a wonderful century against South Africa. Why? Because he thought some team-mates were involved in a spoof Twitter account which mocked his rampant egotism. ‘I was completely broken, absolutely finished, mentally shot,’ he said (peeling an onion) in an interview to accompany the book launch. Here we go again, everybody. It’s all about me, me, me! English cricket is full of heroic tales. In 1933, at Brisbane, Eddie Paynter of Lancashire left his sick-bed with a temperature of 102 to make 83 runs that helped win a Test match. Thirty years later, at Lord’s, Colin Cowdrey went out to face the mighty Wes Hall with a broken arm to ensure the West Indies did not win. Pietersen described Alastair Cook's captaincy of the England cricket team as 'weak' and 'tactically inept' Most famously, at Headingley in 1981, Ian Botham responded to a run of wretched form that cost him the captaincy by giving the greatest all-round performance in the history of our game to turn a Test, and a series, on its head. Botham’s Ashes, they still call it, and always will. That’s immortality. Did Paynter say: ‘I shall stay in bed today’? Did Cowdrey say: ‘It’s not worth it’? Did Botham say, as Pietersen did at Leeds: ‘It’s not easy being me in this dressing-room’? Not a trace of it. They pulled on their boots and strapped on their pads. ‘Blubber’ Pietersen, on the other hand, went: ‘Boo hoo hoo, the rotters are being beastly! It’s so unfair!’ The rotters have always been unfair to Pietersen on his ‘incredible journey’ through cricket: my word, how he loves his ‘incredibles’! They forced him out of Natal when he was 20 and have made his life a misery ever since. Only last week, Surrey released him from his contract. It may have had something to do with the fact he was rarely spotted at The Oval. Where the England team is concerned, it has been evident for some time that, taken as a group, they are not the most attractive group of players. As for Pietersen’s claims that a culture of ‘bullying’ existed, we shall hear more anon and the revelations from other witnesses may not be in his favour. Cricketers are not, on the whole, mean-spirited. In a team environment that tests the bonds of friendship or mutual respect, because of the months they are obliged to spend with one another, they tend to be collegiate creatures, happy to rub along with whoever they find alongside them. Pietersen (left) pictured with Graeme Swann at the end of the fourth Ashes cricket test in Melbourne in 2010 . Pietersen, pictured during the last Ashes series, told his side of the story in his new autobiography . VIDEO Pietersen blastst former England 'regime' So it has always been significant Pietersen has proved unable to find a companionable berth in any dressing-room he has shared. From Durban to Kennington, by way of Nottingham and Southampton, he has been mistrusted by colleagues who may have tolerated his selfishness but who rarely found a kind word to say for his comradeship. For all his inane prattle about ‘buddies’, Pietersen found few allies and fewer friends. ‘Has our famous batsman failed?’ a Hampshire player asked reporters one day at Southampton after hearing that Pietersen had been dismissed in the Lord’s Test. ‘Oh dear, what a pity. We’re so upset.’ One may judge a man by his friends. One may also judge him by those he perceives to be enemies. Evidently Pietersen has little time for Andy Flower, the former coach, whose principled opposition to the genocidal Robert Mugabe is well-known; to Strauss, who enjoys the respect of everybody within the game; and to Paul Downton, the managing director of English cricket, who has never made a foe in his life. He also called Hugh Morris, Downton’s predecessor, who fought a courageous battle against cancer, a ‘weak p***k ’. Upon receiving his 100th cap, Pietersen described the England dressing room in November 2013 as 'the best environment that I have ever experienced' only to then describe and deride a 'bullying' culture within the team . The model for Pietersen's autobiography seems to be Alice in Wonderland... he sees what he wants to see . Clearly he is not the most rounded of men. Unable to sense mood or interpret events in the way that a better balanced person would, he has come to rely on a small army of advisers who have not always served him well. All together now: Me, me me! His friends could have told him that it was unwise to cover his forearms with England tattoos before he had played a single Test for his adopted country. They could have told him breathless attempts to be pally with famous players usually rebound on the groveller, and that words such as ‘dude’ and ‘buddy’ reveal the speaker to be a twerp. But they didn’t. Instead Pietersen became cocooned in a tower of illusions and frustrations, railing against a world of deceivers, as self-deceivers often do. Some cricket-lovers are sympathetic, to a degree. Most washed their hands of him a long time ago. Pietersen (right) has a series of high-profile supporters, including Piers Morgan (centre) He should have been remembered for his magnificent strokeplay, and indeed his handful of superb innings will be recalled whenever people consider his cricket. But, after this latest shabby exercise in score-settling, the Pietersen story will be known mainly for the lamentations of the most self-obsessed sportsman of our age. Sir Ronald Harwood, the dramatist and Oscar-winning screenwriter, also came to this country from South Africa, and loves cricket with a passion. Yesterday, reflecting on the Pietersen imbroglio, he said something magnificent. ‘There is such a thing as the spirit of the game, and that spirit has triumphed, to his disadvantage.’ Meanwhile, somewhere through the looking-glass, Alice wants a friend to hold her hand.","With a bat in his hand Kevin Pietersen achieved remarkable things, but with a pen he fools nobody but himself .

"The day will be forever etched into her memory - the moment America's youngest ever president was assassinated on the streets of Dallas, Texas. Mary Ann Moorman and her friend had gone to the parade route with her new Polaroid camera, eager to take a snapshot when the President and First Lady passed them in the motorcade. Little did she know that she would capture the moment immediately before Lee Harvey Oswald fired the fatal shot that killed John F Kennedy. Tragic moment: Mary Ann Moorman took this Polaroid photograph, showing the President and the First Lady reacting after Kennedy had been hit in the throat. Almost the instant after this photo was taken, Kennedy was hit in the head . Up close: Mary Ann Moorman is seen in the Zapruder film, as she is in the blue raincoat taking a picture of the President and First Lady in the foreground just as he was shot . At first she did not know what was going on, thinking that the snap she heard was that of a firecracker. 'That was my thought: ""I saw his hair jump!"" But it wasn't just his hair, it was part of his head,' she told Matt Lauer on The Today Show. 'I heard Jackie yell, ""My God, he’s been shot"".’ Ms Moorman was a 31-year-old housewife at the time of the assassination. The Zapruder film - named after Abraham Zapruder, the man who captured Kennedy's assassination on a home camera - shows Moorman . standing in a blue raincoat next to her friend in a red raincoat . on the grass between Elm Street and Main Street as the President's . convertible drives by. What . Moorman didn't realize when she chose to wait for the motorcade was that . her location was in line with the Texas Book Depository, where shooter . Lee Harvey Oswald was waiting on the sixth floor. Then: Mary Ann Moorman was rushed to a local newspaper office after a reporter saw she had taken a picture . Now: Mrs Moorman, 81, sat down for an interview with the Today Show and said that she believes there is 'more' to be discovered about the true nature of the Kennedy assassination . On their way: Mrs Moorman (left) and her friend (right) went to the parade together in matching raincoats . 'I heard the shot, took the camera down, and I heard two more shots,' she told the Today Show. 'Just pow, pow, pow.' In the hectic aftermath immediately following the shots, a local reporter approached Ms Moorman and accompanied her to his newspaper office so that they could take a look at the photo together as it developed. It shows Jacqueline leaning in towards her husband as he appears to be falling back into the seat. 'The . though always comes back to me: I saw a man murdered right in front of . my eyes. That thought is still present in my mind right now,' she said. Different angle: From where she was standing, Ms Moorman was closest to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and said that she could here her scream 'My God, he's been shot!' Orientation: Ms Moorman and her friend were standing on the grass between the point of impact and the location of Orville Nix (noted on this aerial photo as 'Cameraman Nix'). Other points marked are the Texas Book Depository, where Lee Harvey Oswald was positioned, and th infamous 'grassy knoll' She agreed to sell the original Polaroid through an auction house but it failed to meet its expected price of $50,000 to $75,000. Ms Mooman, who is now 81-years-old, said she does not subscribe to any of the major conspiracy theories but many others actually used her photograph as part of their justification for their own versions of events - specifically the 'grassy knoll theory' that suggests there was a second shooter. She said that she never 'delved' into any of the different theories but continued to remain wary of the final conclusion that was drawn by the Warren Commission, which in 1964 ruled that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone. 'I don’t think that I heard any more shots than three but so many of the things that I have heard makes me think that there's a lot more to the story,' she said.

"Hurtling at full speed with its horns ready to strike, a raging bull runs into a man and shoves him into the sea as other revellers look on in shock. The terrifying moment happened during the Bous a la Mar festival in Denia, on the eastern coast of Spain, in which men emerge from protective barriers and encourage bulls to chase them. The festival took place as two British men spoke of how they were gored by a bull at Spain's most famous festival. Liam Tarff, 29, and 20-year-old Nick Couchman were attacked when the half-ton animal, called Runaway, broke off from the main pack at the Running of the Bulls festival in Pamplona. On the rampage: A bull chases a man into the sea during the Bous a la Mar festival in the eastern Spanish coastal town of Denia . Jumping in: Revellers emerge from protective barriers to provoke bulls into chasing them into the water . Dangerous: Grinning men watch and hold the bull's horn after the animal joins the man in the water . Mr Tarff, an insurance worker from Brixton, London, was gored in the left thigh. Fellow Londoner Nick Couchman, a 20-year old events organiser, was gored in the right thigh. Mr Tarff, who managed a thumbs up to the . crowd as he was carried away in agony on a stretcher with a blood-soaked . bandage around his leg, said: 'It was a feeling of sheer panic when I . saw the bull stop, turn round and run towards me. 'I was trapped against the barriers with people crowded around me and no fast way out. 'I felt its horn go through my leg. It was like being stabbed with a large knife. Gorged: Laim Tarff was helpless to stop the half ton bull piecing his left thigh with its horn. He is pictured here with the bandaged leg recovering in hospital . Terrifying: A reveler  tries to escape a bull in the bull ring, at the end of third running of the bulls at the San Fermin fiestas, in Pamplona . Daredevils: A runner looks alarmed as he is tossed into the air by a rampaging bull . One man is photographed clinging on to a bulls horns for dear life as he tries to avoid being injured . Ouch! A bull tramples over a crowd of men the bull ring . 'I fell to the ground and managed to crawl under the barrier. 'The next thing first aiders were poking their fingers into my open wound to check there were no pieces of bull horn stuck inside and then I was carried off into an ambulance. 'I only did the run for a friend who's celebrating his 30th birthday and dreamed of taking part. He's due to become a father in September and everyone was telling him not to do it but he survived unscathed. 'I'm starting to realise now just how lucky I've been. 'If the bull's horn had gone in a few inches higher through somewhere like my heart, I probably would not have been around to tell the tale. Painful: A man lets out a yelp of pain as a cow tosses him out of the way during the San Fermin festival in Pamplona . Basque regional policemen help a runner to his feet after he fell during one of the runs . Leap: A steer jumps over the crowd of runners blocking its way . 'Fortunately the doctors have told me I'll be okay.' He added: 'The ironic thing is that I've been staying off the alcohol to make sure sure I'm in form for the run with the bulls every morning. I'm probably the most sober person at the festival. 'We tried to do the run on Sunday but were turned back because there were too many people. 'We saw other people who were off their heads running barefoot. 'The experience has been worth it but I don't think I'll be repeating it in a hurry.' Friend Paul Edwards, 29, one of a group of five pals Liam ran with, added: 'We knew he had been gored from the live TV images they showed in the bullring after the run.

'We were joking before we came over that one of us was going to get gored and the images were going to be all over Youtube but we never imagined it would happen for real.' Second victim Nick, also taking part in his first Running of the Bulls festival - called the San Fermines in Spanish - said: 'I know it's been a bit of madness but I'm still glad I took part. 'I might change my mind later but at the moment I feel like I want to do it again.' Liam and Nick were among three people gored at today's run. A 39-year-old American was also attacked and another three suffered bruising. Runners sprint alongside Miura fighting bulls at the Estafeta corner .

The 1,200 bull called Fugado - which in English means Runaway - caused most of the chaos.It fell over at the start of the half-mile course in Pamplona, northern Spain, and completed most of the run on its own. The two Brits were gored near the end of the run, the third of the nine-day festival made famous by a 1926 Ernest Hemingway novel, and the bloodiest so far. Other thrill-seekers pulled Fugado by the tail and waved their traditional red neckscarves at it in a desperate attempt to divert its attention and save more bloodshed.

Fifteen people have been killed at the annual festival since records began in 1911, and 200 to 300 are usually injured each year. The most recent death was in 2009 when 27-year-old Daniel Jimeno, from Madrid, was gored in the neck by a bull called Capuchino. The event has become increasingly popular with foreigners, who join the locals by staying up all night drinking and partying before thousands compete in the 8am run. Pamplona's population of 200,000 swells to around two million during the festival, the largest in Spain. After each morning run, the animals are killed in an afternoon bullfight. An estimated 1,900 thrill-seekers competed in today's/yesterday's (MON) run, around half the number who took part at the weekend. The 850-metre-long run through Pamplona's old town lasted just over three and a half minutes. A 73-year-old local was the only person gored in the first two runs.","Animal goes on the rampage at the Bous a la Mar bull-chasing festival in Denia, eastern Spain .

"The letters were all written in German by author Ian Fleming, pictured, and were for his Austrian lover Edith Morpurgo, the daughter of Salzburg businessman Abraham Morpurgo . James Bond creator Ian Fleming told his Austrian lover he'd like to hurt her then tame her 'like a wild animal' in series of love letters, it was revealed today. The letters, written in German by Mr Fleming, were for his lover Edith Morpurgo, the daughter of Salzburg businessman Abraham Morpurgo. Written in the early 1930s, he tells his temptress: ‘I'd like to sleep with you just once and do nothing to you, just wrap my arms around you and hold you tight and find you there when I wake up.’ In another missive, sent from 11 Throgmorton Avenue, where he was working for banker Cull & Co, Mr Fleming writes: ‘I will say nothing more to you – only that I ---- you. ‘If I were to say “love” you would only argue, and then I would have to whip you and you would cry and I don't want that. I only want for you to be happy. But I would also like to hurt you because you have earned it and in order to tame you like a little wild animal. So be careful, you.’ The letters are part of a collection, said to be worth up to £47,500, which will be auctioned off at the New York antiquarian book fair next week by booksellers Peter Harrington. As well as the passionate but heartfelt notes, the collection also features two illustrations for Miss Morpurgo – one of which describes where on her body he would like to kiss her. Inscribed with ‘Wo ich Dich küssen will’ (where I want to kiss you), the image is of a pair of eyes and a pair of feet with kisses dotted in between. The second illustration, called ‘Ich will mit Dir’ (I want to ... with you) shows a door with a Do Not Disturb sign on it and two pairs of shoes on each side. The collection also includes a photograph of Mr Fleming sat in Austrian mountain scenery wearing climbing boots and shorts. The image is captioned: ‘Der Vater von James Bond 007, ein Freund 1934 in Osterr[eich]’ which translates to ‘The father of James Bond 007, a friend in 1934 in Austrian’. The collection of letters, illustrations and a photograph, which have been valued at around £47,500,  will be auctioned off at the New York antiquarian book fair next week by booksellers Peter Harrington . While the letters are not all dated, those which are place Mr Fleming and Miss Morpurgo’s relationship in 1934 and 1935, when Fleming would have been in his twenties. It is thought he spent time in Austria before studying at Geneva Unviersity and working at Reuters. In 1933, he moved to London and joined banking firm Cull & Co. Miss Morpurgo, who was born in 1912, four years after the author, went on to marry Julius Jakob David Essinger in 1939 and had a daughter with him. The couple and their child died in Auschwitz in 1942. London-based booksellers Peter Harrington describes the collection as a ‘fine correspondence revealing the typically tempestuous relationship, with hints of sadomasochism, between the young Fleming and Edith Morpurgo (1912–1942)’. One letter which has been ripped up by recipient Edith Morpurgo before being taped back together again, pictured, tells how Mr Fleming is jealous of her other friends . Some of the letters highlight the passion between the pair, with one reading: ‘I only want to kiss you and say nothing. It makes no sense, but I send you the pieces – of my HEART!!!!’ Another says: ‘I will protect you and perhaps understand you better and you will become calmer. 'You’ll really need little money, beloved, and I beg you not to worry about it … I kiss you and I am happily YOUR Ian.’ One of the letters, which was ripped up by the recipient before being taped back together, also reveals a different side to their relationship. It reads: ‘You know that I don’t like your friends because I am a little jealous of them and don’t like the fact that you look forward to being with them. I know I cannot keep you in a cage like a bird.’ Ian Fleming also sent his lover a picture of himself in front of an Austrian mountain and captioned it: 'Der Vater von James Bond 007, ein Freund 1934 in Osterr[eich]' which translates to 'The father of James Bond 007, a friend in 1934 in Austrian' London-based booksellers Peter Harrington describes the collection of letters as a 'fine correspondence revealing the typically tempestuous relationship, with hints of sadomasochism, between the young Fleming and Edith Morpurgo (1912 - 1942)' Senior specialist Adam Douglas said the letters show ‘romantic flirting’ but a ‘rather sadistic side to Fleming as well’. He told The Guardian: ‘They were written so early in his career that he was of course not famous … so the chances of somebody keeping this kind of material are quite low. ‘They're by an author well before he became an author, playing around with the things he would turn to gold.’ He also added that it gave the public more of an insight into what the James Bond writer was like and added how ‘rather amazing’ the likeness between the author and his famous fictional character were. English author Ian Fleming, pictured, had twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections published - two of which were published posthumously following his death in 1964 . Mr Fleming, who was born in London into a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co, started writing his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, on 17 February 1952. It was completed within two months and published in the UK in April the following year. In total, he had twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections published - two of which were published posthumously following his death in 1964.","Letters reveal passionate relationship between author and Edith Morpurgo .

"From vampy plum to pale pink, most women own at least a handful of lipsticks. But few will have considered the ingredients that give them the perfect pout. Now, one chemistry teacher has revealed the strange components that go into lipstick, including insects, wax and even chilli. Scroll down for video . Chemistry teacher Andy Brunning has revealed the strange chemicals that go into lipstick, including insects and chilli, which plumps up the lips. He says that while brands tweak their recipes, all lipsticks are made of oil, wax and pigments or dyes (as shown above) Red lipstick (pictured) often includes insects and most long-lasting hues feature a chemical compound called eosin, which subtly changes colour when it is applied to the lips. The dye reacts with the amine groups found in proteins in the skin, which makes it long-lasting . A single lipstick contains several hundred different chemical compounds to give it the desired colour, glossiness, and indelibility. And while ingredients will differ between brands, there are a number of essential ingredients, according to Bournemouth-based teacher Andy Brunning who is the author of the blog, Compound Interest. The pigment used in red lipstick is often made from crushed cochineal bugs, which live on cacti. The colour is known as Carmine red – or carminic acid – and is prepared by boiling the insect bodies in ammonia or sodium carbonate solution. Cochineal beetles provide the pigmentation for red lipsticks. Eosin is used in vampy deep hues and makes lipsticks long-lasting. Titanium dioxide is added to red pigment to produce sugary pink shades. Capsaicin - a compound found in chillies - acts a minor skin irritant so it plumps up the lips. Carnauba wax is included in lipsticks that are less likely to melt if they are left in a hot car. Castor oil enables lipstick to glide onto the lips and affects its glossiness. The mixture is then filtered before hydrated potassium aluminium sulphate is added. Deep red lipsticks and formulas that claim to be long-lasting, often include a chemical compound called eosin. The dye subtly changes colour when it is applied to the lips and produces a lipstick that has a slightly blue tinge. The dye reacts with the amine groups found in proteins in the skin, and this reaction causes its colour to intensify to become a deeper red. This reaction also makes the dye longer-lasting than others. Other pigments and dyes – which only make up five per cent of a lipstick – are used for different colours. Titanium dioxide, which is a white compound, is a common ingredient that is added to dilute red lipsticks and make them pink. Other compounds can be added in small quantities to make formulas more moisturising or fragrant. For example, capsaicin – a compound found in chillies – can act as a minor skin irritant, which causes the lips to swell slightly, plumping them up. Waxes and oils make up the bulk of lipstick’s composition, with waxes crucial to the structure and shape of the lipstick. Capsaicin – a compound found in chillies (left) – can act as a minor skin . irritant in a lipstick, which means it causes the lips to look plumper, . while bees wax (right) is often included in a formula to bond all the . chemicals together and give the product its shape . Beeswax, which is composed of 300 different chemical compounds, is often used, while other natural alternatives include Candelilla wax from a Mexican shrub and lanolin, which is a substance secreted by the glands of sheep. Carnauba wax – obtained from the Brazilian Carnauba Palm – makes a lipstick less likely to melt in the sun because it has the highest known melting point of any wax at 87˚C. As well as keeping the lipstick in shape, the waxes also bind together other ingredients and can determine its glossiness. Oils, such as castor oil, make up around 65 per cent of any lipstick and give the cosmetic its skin-softening properties, as well as making it glide onto the lips. In recent years, there have been concerns about traces of heavy metals in lipsticks. One study by the University of California, Berkeley, found that 32 brands of lipstick contained tiny amounts of lead, aluminium, chromium and manganese, but it was based on humans ingesting the lipstick and the levels consumed were considered to be safe. Despite this, lots of  cosmetics companies are careful to make their products lead-free. Major food companies have been accused of 'hoodwinking' shoppers by naming them after ingredients that aren't in the packet. Beef . and Tomato Pot Noodle, Uncle Ben’s chicken rice and Schwartz . bacon-flavour bits are just some of the big brands which fake their meat . content to entice consumers. Mr . Isark, founder of the Can I Eat It? barcode scanning app and website, . said: 'They’re not breaking any rules – but there are calls for clearer . labelling to stop shoppers from being caught out.'

"She might have found fame on The Only Way Is Essex but Lauren Pope, 32, is proving to be a serious force to be reckoned with in the business world. The TOWIE star has seen her clothing line and hair extension brand go from strength to strength in recent months and has even won herself some celebrity fans. Indeed, so popular has her Hair Rehab London business become that even style queen Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has been spotted wearing her extensions on The X Factor. Scroll down for video . Business brains: Lauren Pope shot to fame on TOWIE but has been running Hair Rehab London since 2007 and now she's modelling her new range of extensions, which she wears herself every single day . Contrary to popular belief, Ms Pope's business career began in 2007 and while she admits her time on the ITV  show has given it a boost, her success isn't entirely down to TOWIE. 'It's my baby, it has been from day one,' she told MailOnline. 'My dad and my best friend are my two sidekicks in the company as I need people I can trust to run it when I have so much going on. 'All the ideas come from my head and they're trend-led.' Having noted the current trend for plaits and slick ponytails, she has unveiled a magnetic snap-on hair piece to meet demand - and Little Mix and Cheryl can't get enough of her hair. The next celebrity on her hit-list is Blake Lively, who she'd love to see wearing her pieces. One business venture that has clearly come as a result of her stint on TOWIE is the 32-year-old's clothing collection for In The Style. 'All the girls on the show get offered stuff all the time but I am very selective about what I do. I want my projects to be things I am passionate about and be able to be proud of them,' she explained. Fashion forward: Lauren says she takes note of the catwalk trends when designing her hair pieces, which are loved by Little Mix . Influential: New research revealed that Lauren is more influential in the style stakes than golden girl of style, the Duchess of Cambridge, which she says is 'mad' Ms Pope, who describes her personal style as 'tailored with a glamorous edge', recently unveiled her AW14 range for the e-tailer and is already working on SS15. Taking inspiration from Nicole Richie, who she says works that 'sexy, boho grunge' look to perfection, Lauren is keen to build on brand Pope. And it seems that the fashion industry is taking her seriously after new research revealed that she is more influential in the style stakes than the Duchess of Cambridge. According to Jeetendr Sehdev, a celebrity branding expert and University of Southern California marketing professor, reality TV stars such as Lauren and Made In Chelsea's Binky Felstead have greater influence when it comes to fashion than the former Kate Middleton. 'Oh my gosh, that was mad!,' said Ms Pope of the news. 'It's so funny but great because fashion is one of my hobbies and influences my work.' Famous fans: Cheryl Ferndandez Versini, left, wore the hair pieces on the Jonathan Ross show recently and Perrie Edwards from Little Mix, right, also likes to lengthen her hair with them . Good place: Lauren, who is currently filming for the show's Christmas episode, says she is happy now that she's made up with Chloe and has nothing to stress about . In between her fashion and beauty duties, she spends most weekends DJ-ing and is currently filming for the TOWIE Christmas special. 'I'm not sure what will happen in the show but I'm in a nice place. I've made up with Chloe and I have nothing to stress about.' She is also rooting for co-star Gemma Collins as she takes on the witchetty grubs and cockroaches of Australia in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. 'I have been crying with laughter at her,' she beams. 'She just delivers everything so bluntly. She's coming across really well and I think she will turn a corner.'

"Life-long battle: Shobna Gulati's hair started falling out after her father died when she was 19 . She is known to millions of Coronation Street and Loose Women viewers  for having a Bollywood-worthy bouffant. But today Shobna Gulati reveals the truth: she has waged a life-long battle with thinning hair. Although afflicted since her teens, her most severe bout began two years ago when she noticed visible patches of scalp and found clumps of hair on brushes and her pillow, and clogging up the shower plughole. Shobna, 47, says: ‘An inch fell out from all around my hairline, and I had bald patches in my parting all over the top of my head that were up to a centimetre wide. ‘I felt dreadful and unattractive, and panicked that it was all going to come out. 'I’d leave my hair down  to try to disguise it or use brown eye shadow to cover up the bald patches. 'I was miserable and hated looking  at pictures of myself.’ About 40 per cent of women will experience some degree of hair loss by the age of 50 due to hormonal changes. But female pattern baldness remains a taboo subject, and Shobna hopes that by speaking out she will reassure others. She also wants to offer hope as, using supplements made from sea algae, she is regaining her locks. Shobna first discovered her hair was thinning after her father died and she moved out of her family home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, aged 19. ‘Both the trauma of my father dying and the change of  diet had an impact on my hair,’ she recalls. ‘I skipped meals and didn’t eat as well as I could have done.’ Temporary hair loss can be accelerated by stress, poor diet and weight loss. While it generally lasts only six months, Shobna’s continued until, at 27, pregnancy caused a rise in oestrogen. It stopped her hair falling out and it looked fuller again. But three months after the birth of son Akshay, her hair started falling out again and Shobna – who split up with her baby’s father while she was pregnant – struggled to cope. ‘It was something else to deal with in addition to the upheaval of single motherhood,’ she says. ‘It was a mess.’ When Shobna found fame in 1998 playing Anita in sitcom Dinnerladies, her thinning hair wasn’t initially a concern – it was neatly tucked away under a hat. But things changed when she joined Coronation Street in 2001. Receding: Actress and Loose Women host Shobna found that she had bald patches as her hair loss got worse two years ago . ‘On screen, with it all blow-dried, it looked fine,’ she says. ‘But I secretly hated what I looked like. As a shop girl I’d be asked to wear my hair up. As I got more comfortable with the make-up girls, I’d ask them to leave some curly bits at the front to make it look fuller.’ Being subjected to the paparazzi forced Shobna to fake a full head  of hair. ‘Clip-in extensions became my favourite accessory,’ she says. In 2006, on a three-year break from the soap, she cut her hair short and bleached it. But it ended up even more brittle. ‘The peroxide killed it. As my hair grew I had weaves put in [in which hair extensions are sewn on to the hair], but my hair was so weak it broke.’ She returned to the cobbles and the role of Sunita in 2009, dyeing her hair brown to make it look fuller. THE hair loss Shobna suffers is  a surprisingly common problem and very distressing. Nutritional deficiency can be  the cause, particularly with iron store levels, which need to be  at a certain level for good hair growth. If a diet is lacking in nutrients, supplements can help. Commonly hair loss will be caused by thyroid problems or fungal scalp infections or will start post-pregnancy, and in these situations supplements would be unlikely to help. In many patients with female alopecia, there seems to be no obvious underlying cause, but often the hair loss spontaneously improves whether or not a supplement is taken, usually after six months. These pills are unlikely to completely reverse hair loss in most women, but for the chance of some improvement they are worth a try. ‘The Only Way Is Essex was popular and everyone wanted big hair,’ she says. ‘I bought into the trend with clip-in extensions – I looked like a Barbie doll.’ By 2012, as she left the Street, her hair had really started to fall out. ‘During my last year I was under a lot of stress over the change in my career and my relationship,’ says Shobna, who split with boyfriend Anthony Brown, 31, last July. Adrenal ‘stress’ glands secrete male hormones into the body, causing hair loss. She was also approaching the menopause, which affects levels of oestrogen too. Low iron levels and thyroid disorders can also contribute, but the most common form of female hair loss – a condition called androgenetic alopecia – happens when the follicles become sensitive to normal levels of male hormones in the body. The main treatment is minoxidil, which is applied to the scalp and stimulates blood supply to encourage regrowth. Steroid injections can also help by suppressing the immune system, which is thought to damage follicles. But Shobna says: ‘I didn’t feel ill and didn’t want to waste my doctor’s time. I didn’t see my hair loss as an illness. I was embarrassed and would have found it too difficult to talk about. It was like saying the word “balding” would make it worse.’ After finishing filming last March, Shobna had extensions to boost her self-esteem. ‘They were marvellous but they weren’t good for my hair, she says. ‘It grew dry and horrible, and every time the extensions came out I felt worse.’ In January she turned to supplements – those on the market include Nourkrin, Nanogen, Hairfollic and Viviscal – containing vitamins, minerals and marine extracts that can make hair grow stronger. ‘I was sceptical,’ admits Shobna.  ‘I worried it would be a waste of money.’ But, in conjunction with a healthy diet, she believes they have made a difference, and two months ago she took out her extensions. ‘I’m not saying this is the solution for everyone but it feels as if I have more hair,’ she says. ‘It feels healthier and more invigorated. I feel like I have taken action and not let the beginnings of the menopause take control of who I am.’ Shobna Gulati uses Viviscal® supplements to promote healthy hair growth, £49.95 (a month's supply) available from Boots and www.viviscal.co.uk .","Actress Shobna Gulati, 47, has been battling hair loss since her teens .

"My eight-year-old daughter Nancy appears in the kitchen looking cross. ‘What’s that disgusting thing bobbing about in the bathroom sink?’ she demands. ‘It’s just a silkworm cocoon,’ I reply airily — much to Nancy’s baffled disgust. No wonder. At the age of 46, there is almost nothing I won’t try to keep the years at bay — but this must be the strangest yet. Frances applying a cocoon to her skin. At the age of 46, there is almost nothing she won’t try to keep the years at bay . The latest weapon in my anti-ageing arsenal is, in truth, fairly revolting: silkworm cocoons, the casing that silkworms — which are in fact a type of caterpillar — spin for themselves before they turn into moths. It is the mulberry silkworm cocoon, the same as used to spin silks in industrial production. The cocoons are harvested in Asia and shipped to Europe. They look and feel like a tiny, hollow white bird’s egg covered in embossed wallpaper and have been hailed on internet forums as the latest secret to flawless skin. Frances uses the mulberry silkworm cocoon, the same as used to spin silks in industrial production. The cocoons are harvested in Asia and shipped to Europe. According to Naomi Moriyama, author of Japanese Women Don’t Get Old Or Fat, trainee geishas in Kyoto have used them for centuries. ‘Japanese women are obsessed with beautiful skin. They are far more comfortable using natural products than many Western women,’ she says. ‘Some of our remedies are thousands of years old,’ adding that it was the youthful hands of women who extracted silk from cocoons in ancient China and Japan that first alerted sharp-eyed matrons to the potential cosmetic benefits of silkworms. Now the idea has gained traction again thanks to the internet and our new obsession with all things natural. Even so, the idea of rubbing an insect cocoon on my face horrifies me. The silk worm — which look like a white maggot — spins the cocoon from its saliva glands. Yuck! The silk worm — which look like a white maggot — spins the cocoon from its saliva glands . However, considering my distinctly greying, lined face, I decide it’s worth a go. Surprisingly, the cocoons are easy to find. When I look them up on Amazon, I’m pleased to find they cost a mere £3.99 for ten. They are described, perfunctorily, beneath a photograph as ‘white silkworm cocoon facial cleanser’. I order 30. They turn up three days later in little plastic wallets covered in bubble wrap, without any instructions, or in fact, any information at all. Thankfully, there is some cursory guidance on the retailer’s Amazon page, advising me to soak the cocoon in hot water to soften it, then rub it gently over my face concentrating on lines and blemishes. Each cocoon should only be used once. Soaking my first cocoon in the bathroom sink Frances was surprised and gratified that it disn't disintegrate into a sludgy mess . Before I actually dare to rub the cocoon on my skin, I seek the advice of top cosmetic specialist Dr Michael Prager — who is surprisingly enthusiastic. ‘Women have used oils from the cocoon as a moisturiser for over a thousand years. It’s wonderful stuff, packed full of healing properties,’ he says. ‘When you soak the cocoon, you release sericin, the substance that binds the silk thread together. This is an amazing protein, containing 18 amino acids, which will definitely help your complexion.’ He explains that sericin acts as a thin film over the face, sealing in moisture to keep skin hydrated. What’s more, he says, it’s been shown to replenish collagen, the substance that keeps skin elastic. I decide to put silkworm cocoons to the test by having my skin scientifically analysed before and after using the cocoons. To this end, I visit Dr Sunil Chopra at the London Dermatology Centre, whose skin-analysing Visia machine measures the signs of ageing — skin texture, pore size, wrinkles, spots and UV damage. Depressingly, I do badly on spots — 90 per cent of women my age have clearer skin than me — and my UV damage is worse than half of women my age. However the elasticity of my skin is good and I’m cheered to learn that my pore size is better than three out of four women my age. ‘There’s some discolouration and scarring from acne and there is quite substantial UV damage around your mouth and on your forehead,’ Dr Chopra says. He advises using the cocoons every other day for a month as part of my beauty routine — I apply my usual moisturiser afterwards — before we analyse my skin again. Soaking my first cocoon in the bathroom sink I’m surprised and gratified that it doesn’t disintegrate into a sludgy mess. I leave it for a couple of minutes in hot water, then pop it onto the end of my finger and rub it in a circular motion around my face — concentrating especially on my chin and forehead where I have most acne scarring and sun damage. Frances with Dr Sunil Chopra at the London Dermatology Centre, whose skin-analysing Visia machine measures the signs of ageing — skin texture, pore size, wrinkles, spots and UV damage . The cocoon feels slightly abrasive and surprisingly solid for something that’s been soaking. It certainly doesn’t feel greasy. Afterwards my skin has a sort of pinkish glow. I wonder if I’ve overdone it and simply peeled off the top layer of skin. Applying my moisturiser, my face feels a bit raw. It stings a little and I resolve to be gentler next time. Looking at my face the next day, I can’t see any difference at all. In fact all week and then into the second week, there’s no change. In all honesty, I’m highly suspicious of these cheap white cocoons with their bubble-wrap packaging. I like my cosmetics to smell lovely and be beautifully boxed. While the elasticity of Frances' skin was good for her age, she did less well on the number of spots she gets . By the third week, the novelty of soaking my cocoons has worn off, and I’m convinced it’s just a gimmick not worth 4p, never mind £4. To top it all, I start to get a nasty spot near the right side of my mouth. I can feel it coming up on Tuesday evening and rubbing the cocoon over it, I wonder whether I’m doing more harm than good. On Wednesday morning however, the spot is shrinking. It hovers beneath the surface of my skin for a couple of days and then, miraculously, it slinks away. At the same time, I notice my skin feels softer, and my complexion looks a little bit plumper and fuller. Peering into the mirror, I wonder whether I’m imagining things. Frances' acne spots, UV damage and scarring improved by 20 per cent . A quick internet search reveals an answer: it turns out any new skin regime will take around four weeks to work, as that’s how long it takes the skin the renew itself. Meeting my friend Laura for lunch, she stares at me quizzically before asking what on earth I’ve been doing to my face. ‘You look much less wrinkly,’ she says bluntly, adding that I look five years younger. Dr Chopra, too, when I see him at the end of the month tells me that my skin looks much better. ‘Your complexion is clearer and smoother. I can see that without the Visia,’ he says. The results from the Visia are astounding. My acne spots, UV damage and scarring have improved by 20 per cent and the texture of my skin is now better than 96 per cent of women my age — an improvement of 20 per cent. My wrinkles too, have noticeably softened, especially around the mouth and eyes. Analysing the results, Dr Chopra is impressed. ‘For a completely natural product with no side-effects this is pretty stunning,’ he says. He tells me that my results are backed up by a study in the Indian Journal of Scientific & Industrial Research, which demonstrated sericin’s hydrating and healing properties. The only way that my skin could have shown an improvement of that magnitude, he says, is by increased collagen. ‘The sericin in the cocoon has clearly promoted collagen production. This explains the healing of acne scars, the increased elasticity and the huge improvement in pigmentation and UV damage. I’d carry on using those cocoons if I were you,’ he says. As we leave the clinic I notice the nurse on her iPad. ‘What are you doing?’ I ask. ‘Ordering some of those cocoons of course,’ she replies.","Aged 46, there is nothing Frances Childs won’t try to keep the years at bay .

"This week, eyebrows were raised in astonishment at the transformation of Taylor Swift's errr... eyebrows. The pop star was remodeled for her photo shoot with Wonderland magazine and given a set of bows large enough to rival Cara Delevingne. The chunky caterpillars completely revamped Taylor's face, turning her from pretty princess into edgy model. Taylor isn't the only star dipping her toe in the bushy brow pool though. The Duchess of Cambridge, Megan Fox, Kate Moss and Gwen Stefani have added considerable size to theirs since the days of skinny eyebrows in the late nineties and early noughties. Taylor was transformed by bushy eyebrows on a magazine cover. She follows stars like Mila Kuni and Coleen Rooney. A larger brow makes a look more polished and glamorous, while a skinny brow has an ageing effect . The celebrity trend has led to the growth of professional brow grooming services  at an astonishing rate over the last decade. Women are paying a small fortune to return their eyebrows to their original state. A larger brow makes a look more polished and glamorous, whereas a skinny brow has an ageing effect on the features. Nilam Patel, founder of HD Brows - who is often referred to as 'The Eyebrow Queen' - said: 'Cara has truly put brows on the beauty and fashion agenda and for that we can all be grateful.' She continued: 'Be patient and grow in brows. 'In the meantime – fake it until you make it! 'I feel options such as good permanent make up and temporary brow extensions are great for people wanting realistic brows when there isn't any hair there. 'There is also so much that can be done with make up to make brows look better. 'If your brows need a boost try a Lash & Brow Booster - it's great for promoting growth of sparse or over-plucked brows.' Gwen Stefani had the ultimate skinny brows in the 90s, but at the Emmys last August they were triple the size . Lily Cole has always had busy brows (pictured left in 2005), but the supermodel has now gone for the darker look . The Duchess of Cambridge has trademark bushy brows, but back in 2005 (left), they were considerably slimmer . Megan Fox is almost unrecognisable with a slimmer brow back in 2004 (left), compared to last month at a film premiere for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Lindsay Lohan never completely over-plucked, but even she has gone to some lengths to make her brows bushier . Mila Kunis is proud of her dark features, but it didn't stop her getting carried away with the tweezers in 2001. She has since grown her brows back to their full capacity . Coleen Rooney is queen of the Scouse brow, but even the WAG went for a slimline look back in 2005 . Keira Knightley has always been proud of her big brows - even back in 2003 (left), but the actress has gone super-sized in recent years . Katy Perry has upped the effort all round since 2006 (left), nowadays the pop star sports bushy brows as well as a glamorous make-up finish . Kate Moss was the queen of the skinny brow back in 1993, but the supermodel has attempted to claw back some of the volume now .","Taylor Swift was transformed by bushy eyebrows on a mag cover last week .

"A terminally-ill, father-of-three who spent the last few months begging pharmaceutical companies to give him an unapproved cancer drug has died, it emerged today. Nick Auden, 41, from Denver, died from stage 4 melanoma at his home on Friday surrounded by his wife Amy and his children Locky, seven, Hayley, five, and Evan, one. Nick and his family believed that the immune-boosting cancer drug  anti-PD-1 would be able to shrink his tumors for good. Scroll down for video... Loving family: Nick Auden, 41, (right) with his wife and three children before he was told by doctors he only had six months to live . Blowing bubbles: Nick Auden said he wanted to stay alive to watch his three young children grow up . PD-1 - Programmed cell death protein 1 - . is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PDCD1 gene and is . currently in clinical trials for cancer treatment. His family had been campaigning for access to a clinical trial of the drug, a treatment currently being tested by pharmaceutical companies Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). An online petition called Save . Locky's Dad garnered half a million signatures. But Nick could not . convince either company to give him the drug. Last week, he flew to MD Anderson . Cancer Center in Houston with wife Amy for a last-ditch experimental . treatment that they hoped would stop the cancer from spreading, Cancer . Connect reports. But it was too late. After being . admitted to intensive care during the treatment, he was flown to his . Denver home on Tuesday in an air ambulance so he could spend his last . days with his family. 'We were airlifted back to Denver mid last week. We got home in time so . the kids could see him. It is a tragedy and I am barely coming to terms . with it,' his wife told Cancer Connect on Sunday. Lost his battle: Denver man, Nick Auden, died at his home on Friday surrounded by his family . Help us: Nick Auden's wife, Amy, pleaded with people to sign a petition to ask the drug companies to give her husband the wonder drug . 'I need my dad': Nick Auden's son, Locky, 7, said in the campaign he wanted his dad to stay alive so they can do things together . Brain tumour: Auden did not qualify for the clinical trial for the cancer drugs because he had a brain tumour, among other complications . The father-of-three did not qualify for a clinical trial because of a health complication. Auden said he was told that in order to be accepted into a clinical trial for the anti-PD-1 drug, he would need to have either no brain tumors or brain tumors that were at least no longer growing. Dr Jedd Wolchok, an oncologist, who is a melanoma specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, says the drug had the potential to cause brain swelling in people with existing brain disease. Since Auden had brain tumours, he and his doctor worked to stabilise the tumours using a combination of drugs and other therapies. After months of monitoring his brain scans, in July, Auden got good news: His tumors had not grown, and he qualified for the Merck trial. But hours later, Auden experienced abdominal pain and went straight to an emergency room, because there was a possibility he had a perforated intestine. Sure enough, he did, and he was instantly disqualified from the trial. Without the drug, Auden's doctor told his . wife, Amy, that ‘this is the end of the road’, and that her husband had . between six and nine months to live. Auden's story started in March 2010, when he had a cancerous mole removed. Although it put him at risk for more skin cancer, he continued to live an active life, running, biking and hiking. But in September 2011, Auden said his doctors told him the cancer had returned and had spread throughout his body. The official diagnosis was stage 4 melanoma, which around 90 per cent of people do not survive. But when he learned about the anti-PD-1 drugs and their ability to treat melanoma, he saw a chance to survive. Wonder drug: Studies of Merck's version of the drug found that 38 per cent of participants in a clinical trial for patients with melanoma saw tumours shrink . Not approved: Pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb, based in New York, is one of the two companies still trialing the anti-PD1-1 drugs . Studies of Merck's version of the drug found that 38 per cent of participants in a clinical trial for patients with melanoma saw tumors shrink. Of those who took the highest doses of the drug, 52 per cent experienced tumor shrinkage. Wolchok, who has not met or treated Auden but has corresponded with him through email, told ABCNews that immune cells typically don't attack cancer in a meaningful way because of a kind of natural brake function called PD-1. There are currently no anti-PD-1 drugs in ‘compassionate use’ trials -- trials for individuals who don't qualify for clinical trials but still want the drug, but according to Wolchok, if the medication works, ‘some people might even be cured’. Auden’s only chance of survival was to become an individual case study under compassionate use rules, which give people access to experimental drugs even if they don't fit into clinical trials. That's when the ‘Save Locky's Dad’ campaign took hold.","Nick Auden, 41, died from stage four melanoma at his home on Friday surrounded by his family .

"Hair brand GHD claim that their new Curve curling tong collection will give girls curls that stay up as long as they do. We like a challenge on FEMAIL almost as much as we like a party, and so Contributing Editor TONI JONES hopped on a plane to Berlin  to put the bold claim to the test. Here's how her hair fared... Before and after: From sleepyhead to SJP as FEMAIL Contributing Editor Toni Jones prepares to put GHD's 24 hour curls claim to the test in Berlin . 7am: Getting prepped  by celebrity hairdresser and GHD ambassador Kenna . Toni says: 'I'm usually a wash and go kind of girl when it comes to doing my own hair but I never say no to a party. 24 hours in Berlin + my own personal hairdresser + the promise to keep the bar tab open as long as I could stay up = my dream day/night out. 'I decided to make the most of having a super stylist at my disposal first thing (Kenna's most recent Instagram post before our trip featured him and supermodel client Jourdan Dunne) and as well as having hair that stayed glam for 24 hours I demanded to look like Sarah Jessica Parker, who has been my hair idol since the Carrie Bradshaw days. 'These days,' Kenna, GHD's styling ambassador, told me, 'we call these kind of long, loose, lovely curls ""LA waves"".' Whatever, Kenna. I loved what he did with the wand and asked the London-born Brooklyn boy to move in with me about 30 minutes into my mini break makeover. A very good start to my good hair day.' 9am: Boutique hotel breakfast at Das Stue then off on our travels around the city . 'Berlin's first boutique hotel seemed a fitting place to prepare for our glamorous day trip. As I foraged around the breakfast buffet a small child actually waved at me, well, at 'the hair'. I felt a bit like Cheryl Cole (although Chezza probably wouldn't have wolfed two croissants and a cheese selection so early in the morning).' 7am: Getting prepped by celebrity hairdresser and GHD ambassador Kenna (and checking the day's hectic shooting schedule for the first bar break) * Add a root lift product to damp hair, blow dry with lots of volume using a paddle/round brush . *  Using a classic tong, twist sections of hair around the full length of the barrel (twisting makes the curls flatter rather than corkscrew cutesy) leaving the ends free to keep the look modern. nb random sections can look cool if you don't have much time . * After a few seconds of heating the hair remove from the barrel and gently pull. Don't brush or shake out. * Spritz all over with a strong hairspray . How-to: Blow dry with lots of volume using a paddle/round brush and then using a classic tong, twist sections of hair around the full length of the barrel . Ta-da: Twisting the hair as you pull it around the barrel makes the curls flatter rather than corkscrew cute. Leave the ends free to keep the look modern . 11am: Taking in some culture at the CFA (Contemporary Fine Arts Gallery) in Mitte . 'This is one of the city's favourite galleries and featured great space and light and very serious staff, basically everything you want from an art gallery. Current exhibitions include a 20th anniversary collection ('How Soon Was Now') and a show from Brooklyn-based artist Borden Capalino based on banal Craigslist pictures and featuring trash, pet food, and even maggots. The grubs made some hair curl. Mine stayed 'totes' LA.' 11am: Taking in some culture at the CFA (Contemporary Fine Arts Gallery) in Mitte . 1pm - Experiencing secret Berlin at  Blub, an abandoned aqua complex in Neukölln . 'We got a glimpse into the secret side of Berlin with a trip to an abandoned swimming pool complex hidden from sight and slowly falling into beautiful decay. Originally the aqua centre featured pools, slides, waterfalls, saunas, Turkish baths... but now it's mostly used as a skate park/hangout by Berlin's cool kids. Spooky. Fabulous. A must-see and a total health hazard… and I was entirely over-styled and overdressed for the occasion but it made a great backdrop for some hot hair pictures.' 1pm - Experiencing secret Berlin at Blub, an abandoned aqua complex in Neukölln . 1pm - Experiencing secret Berlin at Blub, an abandoned aqua complex in Neukölln . 3pm - Lunch at Parker Bowles in Moritzplatz . This was my first chance to swish the hair at hot Berliners as we late lunched at the very hip Parker Bowles, named - of course - after our beloved Camilla. I'm sure the Duchess of Cornwall would have approved of the pulled pork burgers served with piles of pickle jalapeños, the homemade lemonade cocktails and definitely the handsome baristas. 3pm - Lunch at Parker Bowles in Moritzplatz . 5pm - A history lesson at the East Side Gallery in Friedrichshain-Kreuzber . After lunch it was time to learn a bit about the city as the curls battled with blustery conditions next to the river Spree. The East Side gallery is a memorial built on a section of the Berlin Wall and it's the largest open air gallery in the world featuring bright, bold murals remembering the city's history and celebrating its future. 7pm - Back at Das Stue getting ready to hit the town . Back at the hotel it was time to ramp up the eyeliner and start breathing in as I donned a bodycon dress. No need to 're-zhujh' the hair though, I just threw my head upside down, gave it a quick ruffle and walked out the door. MASSIVE result and serious time saving points for those of us who like to get to the bar as early as possible. 7pm - Back at Das Stue getting ready to hit the town . 9pm - Drinks at the Monkey Bar at the 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin . The Monkey Bar got it's name because drinkers have a direct view into the monkey enclosures in the Berlin Zoo below. There was a lot of interesting wildlife around the rum-themed bar too, which was packed even on a Tuesday night and a perfect place to put 'the hair' - dropping slightly but still still going over 12 hours in - to the test with a quick smirt on the balcony outside. 11pm - Paleo dinner at Sauvage Berlin in Neuköll . Berliners don't really do diets... but they won't argue with an eating plan that guarantees more energy to stay out partying. Paleo - aka eating like a caveman - is hot right now in this city and Sauvage is the leader of the pack. It helps that Boris the owner resembles a male model (that no sugar, no dairy, no processed regime obviously works). We feasted on steak tartare, monkfish, and dairy-free fondant and drank too many of the brilliantly named Homo-Eruptus cocktails, with 'the hair' scoring a second round on the house. 11pm - Paleo dinner and drinks at Sauvage Berlin in Neuköll (right) Sauvage’s menu emerged from boss Boris Leite-Poco's personal experience of transforming his body through the Paleo diet. According to fans of this way of eating, adjusting your eating habits to Paleo principles means feeding your body as nature intended, resulting in noticeable health benefits because the unprocessed and/or raw ingredients used have high nutritional value. Chef, author and restaurateur Boris Leite-Poco is spearheading the trend for Paleo eating in Berlin . THE PALEO BROWNIE (Flourless Chocolate and Beetroot Brownie) Combine the beets and honey in a sauce pan, and cook on medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until beets are soft. in the mean time, combine in a bowl the eggs, fats, vanilla, cardamom and cocoa and whisk well. Preheat the oven to 135°C. Remove beets from heat, transfer to a food processor, or blend using a hand blender until completely pureed. Combine both mixtures, add walnuts and a pinch of salt. Lay the mixture on a greased square oven dish (or lined with baking paper) and bake for 30 minutes or until firm. 1am - Cool cocktails at Geist Im Glas in Neukölln . A trip to Berlin isn't complete without stumbling across a secret bar. And this smoky speakeasy was the perfect place to deconstruct our day and plan the rest of our night. The back shelves here were filled with dangerous-looking bottles of home-flavoured spirts and there was no main cocktail menu, instead the (only slightly intimidating) bar staff created bespoke cocktails based on what we felt like drinking and doing (my tipple was an incredible tequila, rosemary and coffee concoction which acted as the perfect pick-me-up). 3am (and onwards) - Dancing at Chalet in Kreuzberg . Kreuzberg is the place to be after the clock strikes 12 any day of the week in Berlin. There's a cheap bar, outside space, secret rooms and a great DJ line-up (even on a Tuesday). This was the final push for the curls, could they last spinning around a smoky, sweaty dance floor? They did. Longer than I could in fact as I headed home around 6am with them still bobbing behind me. It's probably for the best that no pictures were allowed. 1am - Cool cocktails at Geist Im Glas in Neukölln and 3am (and onwards) - Dancing in Kreuzberg . 7am - Time to call it a night back at Das Stue . After watching the sunrise from our pretty balcony it was time for bed. My hair certainly SMELLED like it had been out for 24 hours (and the rest) after partying with the city's smokers BUT it managed to look quite a bit fresher than I felt. 7am - Time to call it a night back at Das Stue . VERDICT: Sold.The magic wand lived up to its 24 hour claim. Yes, it helps having a hair superstar styling your 'do to begin with, but Kenna didn't do anything groundbreaking to my barnet, he just prepped it really well using more product than I usually would, blow-dried it properly (which I never bother to do) and then spent time working patiently through all sections of the hair. It didn't take as long as it looks like it should have. It DID include a lot of hairspray. and it DID put a bounce in my step all day and night. Having taken some tips from the hair guru and learned not to spend my evenings scraping my hair up and down according to temperature issues I will be taking my GHD curls out on the town again as soon as my liver allows.","Writer spent 24 hours drinking in the sights and soaking up the nightlife of Berlin to come up with a whirlwind guide to the city .

"Bust-boosting surgery has never been more popular, with more than 11,000 boob job operations taking place in the UK alone each year. But not everyone wants to go under the knife, including some of the A-list clients who visit Harley Street medic Dr Neetu Nirdosh. Instead of scalpels and implants, they are opting for a new treatment which has been dubbed 'the Botox boob job' and uses injectables to plump up the cleavage. Scroll down for video . New look: The 'Botox boob job' is said to boost the breasts by up to a cup size but only lasts for six months . 'The Breastox- Botox is fast becoming the must have pre-red carpet procedure for my celebrity clients,' explains Dr Nirdosh. 'It is a knifeless instantaneous breast lift. This form of breast augmentation works best for those who are between a cup size A and C and is safer and quicker than regular surgery.' The £1,000 treatment involves injecting Botox into the pectoral muscles which temporarily relaxes them, leaving the shoulder and surrounding chest muscles to take the strain. As a result, breasts are lifted and look higher and firmer, although given Botox wears off, the effect lasts for a maximum of six months. 'There's no downtime, no reported side effects, no scars and it is virtually painless,' adds Dr Nirdosh. 'It takes less than 30 minutes and is the ideal treatment for women suffering from post-pregnancy droopy boobs, ageing, sagging breasts or a wrinkly bust line as a result of sun damage. Popular: Botox is the most popular injectable in use in the UK and accounts for 45,464 treatments a year . Risky: Breast enhancement isn't without its risks as the recent PIP implant scandal demonstrated . 'It is also good if you want a bit of extra support so you can go braless as many of my red carpet clients do.' Traditional breast enhancement involves having a cut made either beneath the breasts or in the armpits and inserting a silicone implant between the breast tissue and the chest muscle. Operations cost between £3,500 and £5,000 and, according to the NHS, complications can include infection, scarring and loss of sensation in the nipple. Nevertheless, according to figures produced by the British Association of Aesthetic Surgeons [BAAPS], they remain one of the most popular cosmetic surgeries. But thanks to scandals such as the PIP implant saga, which saw women fitted with enhancements made with industrial, rather than medical, grade silicone, many are turning to 'safer' injectables such as Botox. Although Macrolane, a filler marketed as a 'lunchtime boob jab' was withdrawn from sale two years ago following claims that 25 per cent of patients suffered complications after the treatment, others have proved considerably less problematic. Among them is Botox, which, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons [ISAPS], is the most popular non-surgical cosmetic treatment in the world. In total, say ISAPS, 45,464 Botox injections were carried out by qualified practitioners on British women last year.","The 'Botox boob job' involves having Botox injected into pectoral muscles .

"She may be one of the world's most scrutinised women, but you'd be mistaken for thinking Gwyneth Paltrow spends hours labouring over her looks. The 42-year-old has revealed that she 'isn't the type' to look in the mirror and study her face and is extremely low-maintenance when it comes to getting ready. Speaking to Stylist's Joanna McGarry about her morning beautifying routine, the A-lister said: 'I'd rather die than be studying my face. I just brush my teeth and try to get dressed and get everyone up. I don't tend to wear much make-up either.' Scroll down for video .

The glamorous mother-of-two, who is getting set to launch a Goop-branded range of fashion and beauty products, also explains that she's been on a journey of self-acceptance and is happy with her looks. She said: 'I'm pretty content with my looks at this point. I like my wrinkles and you know, I like what I see.' Proving that she's just like the average women, Gwyneth admits that even she has down days where she feels self-critical but tries to see the positive side. 'I try to appreciate the incredible life I've lived and all I've learned. I like that all of that is written on my face.' Au natural: Gwyneth says that while she wears a lot of make-up for work, when she's at home she just brushes her teeth, gets dressed and slicks on some mascara and lip gloss . Acceptance: The mindful actress says she likes what she sees when she looks in the mirror and believes sleep, exercise and clean eating are key to healthy skin . Gwyneth, who advocates mindful living, credits her maturity for her relaxed approached to beauty and life and swears by sleep, good nutrition and a bit of exercise for glowing skin. The Hollywood star, who is extremely well-connected, also reveals that her famous friends, including Stella McCartney and Cameron Diaz, are 'happy about where they are' now. Gwyneth will be putting her beauty expertise to good use as she prepares to launch a collection on her Goop. The firm, which started out as the actress’ personal blog on how to live a ‘whole and healed life’, is set to launch its own range of clothing and beauty products to turn around its flagging fortunes. Paltrow has hired American lawyer Lisa Gersh to heal the brand’s image following years of negative publicity. Happy pals: The Hollywood star, who is extremely well-connected, also reveals that her famous friends, including  Cameron Diaz, right, are 'happy about where they are' now . Critics have mocked Miss Paltrow’s tendency to champion expensive products such as £46 homemade fishfingers, £3,000 wardrobe essentials and a £15,000-a-week holiday in her favourite French chateau. Now, as well as giving its 150,000 subscribers tips on fashion, food and décor, it will offer them the chance to buy Goop-branded merchandise. Miss Gersh, who is now Goop’s chief executive, told the Sunday Times: ‘The good stuff, the lifestyle advice and the travel tips, will still be there. But we will be selling our own Goop brand of clothing and beauty products online. ‘This is a chance to develop a massive new type of e-commerce company that was just not possible when I started out in the 1990s.’ Gwyneth  is also opening a second Goop pop-up shop in Dallas, Texas next Monday, where fans will be able to buy Christmas gifts featured on her lifestyle website.

"The ice bucket challenge may seem cool if you live in a place which is usually quite hot, but for those who dwell in a cold climate the idea is probably less impressive. Like if you lived in chilly Russia, for example, the sensation of tipping a bucket of ice water over your head is probably not dissimilar to leaving the house on a rainy day. So it's perhaps no wonder that it's a Russian scientist who has staged the most spectacular spin yet of the ice bucket challenge – using minus 195 degree Celsius liquid nitrogen. Cool cat: Russian scientist Anton Sharypov grabs a bucket and pours liquid nitrogen over his head . Survivor: Mr Sharypov before and after the challenge, which appears to have been staged outside his work . A spectacular video shows Anton Sharypov, 34, a physicist from Krasnoyarsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai, as he grabs the bucket and pours the bitterly cold liquid over his head. Seconds earlier he had taken a branch with some leaves from a nearby tree and plunged into the liquid nitrogen, freezing it instantly so it could be crumbled into shards in his hands. Yet when he pours the liquid nitrogen over his head, instead of freezing himself solid, he simply shakes his head and indicates yes, it is cold, but I'm still here. The video first appeared on the YouTube channel of Dmitry Shilov as part of a project called 'What happens if we try this...' Mr Sharypov said before the challenge: 'I am putting my faith in the laws of physics, biology and mathematics and I hope nothing will go wrong.' Just to make sure he is not frozen solid after taking the liquid bath, his friend pokes him to check he is still soft as the intrepid scientist laughs into the camera. You still human bro? Mr Sharypov is poked by his friend to make sure he's not turned to ice . Ice cold: Before enduring the challenge Mr Sharypov had shown the effect of the liquid nitrogen on a leaf by dipping it in for a few seconds then crumbling it between his hands . It's possible for liquid nitrogen to pass on top of human flesh without freezing, because when it is poured onto the human body, something called the Leidenfrost effect comes into play. This is a phenomenon in which a liquid produces a layer of insulating vapour that prevents the liquid coming into direct contact with a surface significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling point. That is to say, because liquid nitrogen has such a low temperature, when it comes in contact with human skin, the temperature difference causes the Leidenfrost effect and it simply skims off the surface of the body.

"She's been transformed into some of the most influential beauty icons of the past, from Audrey Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot to Farrah Fawcett and Madonna, but Gwyneth Paltrow has taken it one step further. The 42-year-old actress, who is the face of Max Factor, has been transformed into a modern interpretation of Marilyn Monroe - and she's barely recognisable thanks to her new look. The star was given the makeover in celebration of the 1940’s and to continue the brand's Hollywood legacy. Scroll down for video . Guess who? Gwyneth Paltrow, 42, has been treated to a 'modern day' Marilyn Monroe makeover for Max Factor - the beauty brand she is an ambassador for . Rocking a  40’s statement lip and volumised lashes, the brand say that Gwyneth's look is an interpretation of one of the most iconic looks of all time. Perhaps Gwyneth is picking up some beauty tips as she prepares to launch her own cosmetics range on Goop. The firm, which started out as the actress’ personal blog on how to live a ‘whole and healed life’, is set to launch its own range of clothing and beauty products to turn around its flagging fortunes. Paltrow, 42, has hired American lawyer Lisa Gersh to heal the brand’s image following years of negative publicity. Spot the difference: Rocking a 40's statement lip and volumised lashes, Gwyneth's look is meant to be an interpretation of one of the most iconic looks of all time, right . Behind the scenes: Gwyneth, who is getting set to launch a Goop-branded range of beauty products, proves her worth as a model on the shoot . Critics have mocked Miss Paltrow’s tendency to champion expensive products such as £46 homemade fishfingers, £3,000 wardrobe essentials and a £15,000-a-week holiday in her favourite French chateau. Now, as well as giving its 150,000 subscribers tips on fashion, food and décor, it will offer them the chance to buy Goop-branded merchandise. Miss Gersh, who is now Goop’s chief executive, told the Sunday Times: ‘The good stuff, the lifestyle advice and the travel tips, will still be there. But we will be selling our own Goop brand of clothing and beauty products online. ‘This is a chance to develop a massive new type of e-commerce company that was just not possible when I started out in the 1990s.’ The mother-of-two, who recently split with husband Chris Martin, has shared the Goop pre-holiday cleanse in her most recent blog post, which she promises will provide a 'jumpstart' so you can hit the party circuit in check. Getting into character: The mother-of-two can be seen posing in a vintage convertible car on the shoot . She writes: 'While we usually devote a chunk of January to getting ourselves back on track after the holidays, we thought we’d do things a bit differently this year. 'Have no fear, the annual goop Detox will be waiting to welcome you into the New Year, but we wanted it to feel a little less shocking.' The clean eater did, however, add: 'If you’re anything like us, you hit the holidays hard - holidays that seem to start earlier and earlier...putting them closer and closer to our summers of over-indulgence.' So, the stylish A-lister called on her good friend Dr. Junger and his team at Clean to help her put together a healthy eating regime. It's not the first time! Gwyneth also transformed into iconic Audrey Hepburn for the beauty brand a few months ago . It includes recipes such as chai gingerbread shake, roasted and clean carrot soup, coconut poached salmon and balsamic miso root salad. There's also pan-steamed chicken and broccoli and miso sweet potato and broccoli bowl, each featured alongside an artsy and appetising photograph. Gwyneth adds: 'This is not a full detox - and it’s not difficult. You also don’t need to buy anything special. 'It’s just a way to eat a little bit cleaner and more mindfully, while giving the wine bottle a bit of time off before it takes center stage. (We’ll be doing it with you @goop, starting on Monday November 10th' and adds the hashtag #goopcleanse to encourage her followers to get involved on social media.

"It has been one of the most widely embraced cosmetic procedures of all time, but it seems our love affair with botox may finally be coming to an end. British women are turning away from using botox and fillers after several recent celebrity horror stories – like the recent cases with Donatella Versace and Renee Zellweger. More women are choosing so called notox facials and spa treatments instead of injectables – and sales up three times higher in 2014 than previous year. Scroll down for video . Increasing numbers of celebrities such as Donatella Versace (pictured) looking unusual has been blamed speculatively on overuse of botox and filler, which has seen a decline in the procedures . This week Donatella Versace looked barely recognisable when she arrived in Brazil for the São Paulo Fashion Week with a stretched, shiny looking face. The previous week Renee Zellweger shocked many when she appeared at a showbiz event looking completely different to her Bridget Jones days. In both cases over-use of botox and fillers was pointed to as a possible cause and now as a result women are turning away from using them and sales are now in decline for the first time since they were introduced around 12 years ago. Many are now turning to safer non-invasive anti-ageing treatments and facials which don't have any negative side-effects. Beauty industry expert Dean Nathanson said: 'There has been massive switch from injectables to anti-ageing treatments clearly because women are concerned about the effects certainly for over-use of injectables. Renee Zellweger shocked many when she appeared at an event (left) looking completely different to her Bridget Jones days (right) 'The move to using facials like the Skinbreeze micro-dermabrasion and oxygen infusion facial which was seen a 200 per cent increase in orders this year, and the CACI micro-current facial which has been dubbed the non-surgical facelift. 'Both have seen massive rises in numbers of new clients, and we hear from many of our new clients that they are concerned about over-use of injectables and so in terms of anti-ageing treatments they are turning to preventative measures.' British star Tulisa caused a media storm when she turned up to court to face drug-related charges looking totally different (left) than she did in her fresh-faced N Dubz days (right) Industry insiders have said that the use of fillers and botox is on the decline now for the first time in over 10 years and women are starting to move away, or at least significantly reduce the amount of injectables they have on their faces. They appear to be turning instead to procedures such as Skinbreeze, which is a facial that includes a combined micro-dermabrasion and LED light treatment followed by an oxygen infusion of neo-peptide rich serums that inhibit muscle responses and therefore attempts to mimic the effects of botox. Since it's launch it has picked up several celebrity fans such as Strictly Come Dancing's Kristina Rihanoff, Binky Felstead from Made In Chelsea and The Apprentice star Luiza Zissman. The news that Botox use may be in decline comes after recent research revealed  that a shocking 84 per cent of youth-seekers admitted to having absolutely no idea what was going into their faces when under-going the procedure - or even if the injection given actually contained key ingredient Botulinum toxin. Transform Cosmetic Surgery, who conducted the research also have seen an alarming 15 per cent rise in the number of patients seeking help following ineffective treatments with non-registered 'faux-tox' salons. Worryingly, they say patients come to them after being treated in a non-clinical environment, despite being given a prescription-only medicine.","Rumors that Botox was to blame for celebrities looking bad recently .

"We've had a freezing past few days in London and I've come to accept the fact that winter is now here to stay. Although I love a good night out, with the colder weather it's so much more tempting to stay in with a cup of tea and a DVD. Every once in a while it's nice to sit back, relax and have some well-deserved 'me time', as well as pampering my face, body and hair with all my favourite beauty bits. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky has been treating herself to a few pampering evenings as the cold nights set in . So this week I thought I'd share with you how I'd spend a perfect relaxing evening in during the winter. BINKY'S RELAXING PAMPER NIGHT IN . For me, there's no better way to start a relaxing evening in than a hot bubble bath. I love the sensuous indulgent aroma of the Tisserand Signature Blend Luxury Bath Soak, which is made up of natural ingredients to relax the body and mind. If I'm feeling particularly stressed I also add in a few drops of the ultra-calming lavender and mandarin scented Tisserand De-Stress Blend Luxury Bath Oil. While relaxing in the bath I'll usually apply a cream face mask to rejuvenate my skin. As I wear a lot of make-up during the week, it's important for me to keep my skin fresh and hydrated so it doesn't end up looking sallow. The La Roche-Posay Hydraphase Intense Masque has a velvety gel-cream texture which is super-soothing on the skin and leaves it looking glowing. Binky says that it is important to rejuvenate your skin and hair with masks . As I use a lot of heated appliances on my hair during the week, when I'm having a pamper evening I also take the opportunity to treat and repair my locks with an intensive conditioning mask such as DHC Rich & Moisturising Care Treatment. Moisturising your body after bathing can sometimes be a tedious task, but not when you're using a gorgeous smelling body butter like L'Occitane Shea Butter Ultra Rich Body Cream. Binky's Essentials For A Girly Pamper Night . The thick, comforting formula leaves skin feeling nourished and supple without leaving any greasy residue – plus the cream's marshmallow and sweet almond extract means your body will be smelling divine for hours. Long baths can sometimes dry your hands out, so I always use the luxurious rose-scented Paul Edmonds Cashmere, Rose de Mai and Patchouli Hand Lotion after bathing – its light, nourishing texture leaves my hands feeling amazingly soft. Once I've slipped on a fluffy dressing gown and settled myself in front of the TV, I like to relax with a cooling gel face mask like the DHC Bio Cellulose Mask to keep my skin feeling plumped and refreshed, as well as reducing any redness or agitation on my face. Simply leave on and chill out for 20 minutes to reveal a thoroughly more radiant complexion. These are Binky's pampering picks for a luxurious night in . If you suffer from under eye bags, I thoroughly recommend the DHC Revitalising Moisture Strips for Eyes. Place the cooling gel patches under your eyes for around half an hour for visibly brighter and more awake-looking peepers. Perfect if you've had a heavy weekend! To round off my pamper evening, I love lighting a scented candle like Yankee Candle in Clean Cotton – which fills my whole bedroom with a beautifully crisp, fresh aroma – and painting my nails a new shade ready for the week ahead. I tend to opt for deep, dark and mysterious tones on my talons during the colder months; my current favourites are Michael Kors Glam Nail Lacquer in the shimmering indigo blue hue Femme Fatale and my very own Binky London Gel Nail Polish in Beaufort Burgundy. Hope you enjoyed reading about my perfect relaxing evening in – you can get all the products I mentioned from Escentual.com. Will you be planning something similar soon? I'd love to hear what pampering products you'd go for! Love Binky xxx .","Binky has been enjoying a few nights in as the evenings get colder .

"With her golden Armenian skin, almond eyes and glossy hair, Kim Kardashian is widely regarded as one of the world's most beautiful women - but even she looks to others for  inspiration. Despite their starkly contrasting looks, the global star has revealed that English rose Kate Moss is her beauty icon. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the 34-year-old said: 'I love Kate Moss. I love how she wears her winged eyeliner and her messy hair and how it looks so effortless but still put together. It looks beachy and messy at the same time; I love her glamour.' Scroll down for video . The London look: Kim Kardashian, left, has revealed that she loves Kate Moss' look - and says she always looks so effortless but well put together . Kim was speaking at the UK launch of Hairfinity, a haircare vitamin complex that promises healthier, longer and stronger hair from within. She and her sister Khloe, who joined her at the event, are big fans of the brand - and Kim credits the £24 product with giving her the hair of her dreams. 'I've tried so many things and I really genuinely love this product. I take two pills in the morning with my vitamins and it works for me.' Kim explained how the supplement, for which she and Khloe are ambassadors, helped her baby hairs grow back after she had them lasered off. 'I wanted some back, I wish I hadn't lasered so much off and when I started taking this supplement, they started growing back the perfect amount so that made me really happy.' Famous fans: The sisters attended the UK launch of Hairfinity, a haircare vitamin complex that promises healthier, longer and stronger hair from within - Kim and Khloe are both huge fans of the £24 product . What's your secret? The famous sisters revealed that they swear by coconut oil and Kim loves a tan because she says it makes her look slimmer . Another product the sisters swear by is coconut oil, which they say is 'everything'. 'When I take off my make-up, I use avocado oil or coconut oil and I also sleep in it, it's amazing for dry hair,' explained Khloe. 'You can put it on your body, too. Coconut oil can do everything.' Kim added: 'As far as products, I love anything from a Neutrogena face wipe to the Kardashian Beauty dry shampoo and conditioner, which we have coming out. I've never seen a dry conditioner out there but it really helps when you're trying to not wash your hair.' Taking tips: Both sisters tale advice from youngest family member Kylie, who they say is amazing at doing her make-up, despite it only taking her fifteen minutes . The beauty buffs were the ones who put contouring on the map - and their love of the make-up trick is still going strong. 'Contouring is the best. It's amazing, once you start, you can't stop,' said Khloe. 'Sometimes people will say: ""Oh, you've got a nose job"" but I just forgot to contour!'. Kim, meanwhile, swears by having a golden glow. She said: 'Tanning is everything, I tan all the time and I do the beds because I have psoriasis so it really helps with that and I just think when you tan, it makes you look so much skinnier.' She also revealed that husband Kanye likes it when she experiments with different looks - but the girls generally agree that men aren't a fan of coloured, bright lips. As well as taking inspiration from Kate Moss, Kim learns a lot from her little sister, Kylie Jenner. Speaking about her 17-year-old sister, she said: 'I live with Kylie so every time she's putting on her lashes or putting on her lip liner, I ask her for advice and how she does it so perfectly. She is so good at make-up.' Khloe agrees, adding: 'Sophia Loren is my icon but I also love my little sister Kylie and what she does with her make-up. Her hair is really funky and cool.' Despite the youngest Keeping Up With The Kardashians star being criticised for her pouty social media snaps, Khloe says that Kylie is actually really low maintenance. Helping hand: Khloe cites Kylie as one of her beauty icons and says she always looks so natural . Party people: (L to R) Marvin Humes, Kim Kardashian West, Khloe Kardashian and Rochelle Humes attend the Hairfinity UK launch . 'I swear her make-up takes her fifteen minutes, she does it all the time and it doesn't take her long and it looks so natural. It doesn't look like she's piled it on.' The sisters were only in London for less than 24 hours but they still managed to do two of their favourite things in the city - eating and shopping. 'London is one of our favourite places,' they said. 'It has the best restaurants, we ate at Cut on 45 Park Lane and had soup and truffle risotto - it was amazing.' 'The shopping is also amazing, from Dover Street to Selfridges, Kim was salivating over the shops,' laughed Khloe. Fresh from their whirlwind trip to London, the sisters attended French Montana's star-studded 30th Birthday Party Powered by CIROC Pineapple in Los Angeles.

"From sportswear to rave, Nineties style has been back on the fashion agenda recently, so this week I thought it'd revisit another favourite look from that decade - grunge. Just as grunge fashion was all about simple, rugged designs - think plaid shirts, woolly beanies and ripped jeans - grunge beauty has a similarly unfussy and understated appeal. It's all about dewy skin, an earthy brown eye and statement nude lips. This is the sort of laid-back prettiness made famous by Kate Moss, Drew Barrymore and other Nineties icons, and it looks just as cool today as it did back then. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky has always been a fan of unfussy style so the grunge look suits her style perfectly . The Face . A pretty beauty look like this one relies on a smooth and glowing face, so start with a good base. The look you're after is light, youthful and fresh - bareMinerals Bareskin Pure Brightening Serum Foundation has an ultra-thin serum formula that brightens the skin without feeling heavy, creating the ideal dewy finish, especially when applied with the bareMinerals Perfecting Face Brush, which has a dipped centre perfect for creating an even, natural-looking finish. The Eyes . Begin by dusting your entire eye socket with a fawn coloured eyeshadow to create a soft base colour - I used the warm brown shade from Guerlain's 4 Couleurs Eyeshadow Palette in Les Cuirs. In order to achieve the 90s beauty trend Binky recommends using a nude lipstick and earthy eyeshadows . Next, take the lighter brown shade from the same palette and define your socket line. Now take the darkest brown shade in your palette and, using a fine eyeshadow brush, blend the colour along your upper and lower lash lines. The key to grunge beauty is its carefree, messed-up feel, which makes life very simple as you don't need to worry about making mistakes - it's all part of the look! To help create that slept-in-your-make-up sexiness, smudge eyeliner along your upper lash line - I used Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet. Finally, coat your lashes with Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara to achieve a sooty-eyed finish. Binky's look requires a dark and defined eyebrow which are currently very on trend . The Brows . Long before Cara Delevingne, Nineties grunge girls boasted strong, defined brows, so I emphasized mine using the Too Faced Bulletproof Brows paste, applied with an angled make-up brush. The Cheeks . The effect you're after is fresh and dewy, so while you don't want to feel caked in products, you still require a touch of colour to add warmth to your face and stop you looking washed-out. Smooth a touch of Daniel Sandler Watercolour Cream Bronzer in Riviera across cheeks, nose, temples and chin, aiming for a subtle finish that will give your face a lightly sunkissed glow. Binky says the pretty yet non-nonsense look is ideal for a night out or a first date . The Lips . A browny-nude lip will complement your brown eyeshadow beautifully, so start by lining your lips with a Clarins Lipliner Pencil in Bay Rose. Begin at the Cupid's bow and carefully work your way around the edge, taking the line just outside the natural line of your lips for a 90s style full pout. Finally, fill your lips in with a warm nude lipstick like Guerlain KissKiss Shaping Cream Lip Colour in Beige Booster, applied straight from the bullet. It's a pretty look with a tough edge, perfect for a first date or a night out. All the products I've used can be found at online beauty boutique Escentual.com. Don’t forget to keep sending in your hair and make-up ideas and requests, and I'll try to help all your beauty dreams come true. Until next week, stay gorgeous, .

"Halloween is just around the corner and I’m mega excited to get dressed up! Fancy dress always makes getting ready for a night out more fun, and on Halloween you can really go crazy with your costumes. I’ve decided on a scary yet sexy look this year, inspired by Natalie Portman in the film Black Swan. It features dramatic winged eyes and a deep vampy berry lip, and offers maximum impact with not too much effort! Binky was inspired by Natalie Portman in the movie Black Swan for her Halloween look . So in case you’re deliberating over your October 31 ensemble, this week I thought I’d share with you how to get the look yourselves. THE BASE . To create a spooky white base for the look, mix white face paint with a dollop of a light coverage foundation like bareMinerals BareSkin Pure Brightening Serum Foundation to make the look slightly less harsh. Binky has used make-up rather than face paint in order to avoid looking too harsh . Apply the mixture all over the face with a foundation brush or sponge like Real Techniques Flawless Miracle Complexion Sponge, and fix in place with a generous sweep of Vichy Dermablend Setting Powder. Next, contour your cheekbones with a strong dark colour for a dramatic sculpted look – I used DiorShow Fusion Mono Matte Eyeshadow in Mirage, brushing the colour heavily just under my cheekbones to create the illusion of a super-structured visage. THE EYES . Start by using a liquid eyeliner with a precise nib like DHC Liquid Eyeliner to create the outline of the haunting dark eyes. Begin from the temple and take the line all around your eyes, ending with a point towards your nose. Feel free to make the outline as big and bold as you like – if you can’t go all out on Halloween, when can you? Binky says that Halloween is the one opportunity to go as bold as you like with makeup . Once you’ve successfully outlined the shape, use the DHC eyeliner to add further lines and patterns into the eye socket to create the swan-wing effect. To fill the eyes in use a highly pigmented black shadow like the dark shade in the Dior 5 Couleurs Palette in Pied-de-Poule. To embellish the eyes further, fill in some sections with the deep navy and green shades from the palette. Follow up with lashings of Guerlain Maxi Lash Mascara to give your peepers a sexily spooky flutter. THE LIPS . Finally, for a vampy Portman-style pout, apply a deep berry or maroon coloured lippy. I’ve gone for the Clarins Rouge Eclat Lipstick in Red Wine, which is super moisturising on the lips and stays put for hours. Binky has gone all out this October and has even tried out some spooky nail art . And there you have it – a ghoulish yet glam Halloween look that you don’t have to be an artist to create. You can get all the products I used from online beauty boutique Escentual.com. If you’re not big on fancy dress but still want to inject a little bit of Halloween spooky spirit to your beauty routine on October 31, why not try out some nail art? I’ve been experimenting with fun Halloween nail looks using my Binky London nail polishes. Enjoy your Halloween celebrations, whatever you choose to dress up as! Lots of love, .

"Stalemate: Syria's deputy prime minister Qadri Jamil claims that the civil war has reached a stalemate . President Bashar Assad's regime has admitted that neither side is capable of defeating the other and the country's civil war has reached a stalemate. Syria's deputy prime minister Qadri Jamil appeared to call for a ceasefire as he suggested there was a 'zero balance of forces' which would not change for a while. He insisted the old regime was at an end but urged the Western world to 'get off our shoulders' while progressive reforms are being made. He told the Guardian: . 'Neither the armed opposition nor the regime is capable of defeating . the other side. This zero balance of forces will not change for a while. 'Let . nobody have any fear that the regime in its present form will continue. For all practical purposes the regime in its previous form has ended. 'In order to realise our progressive reforms we need the west and all those who are involved in Syria to get off our shoulders.' Syria's main Western-backed opposition group, meanwhile, has slammed al-Qaida-linked gunmen and their expanding influence in the country, saying the jihadis seek to establish an Islamic state in Syria. A statement on Friday from the Syrian National Coalition follows days of vicious infighting in which the extremists seized control of the northern town of Azaz from mainstream opposition fighters. The SNC says the actions of the al-Qaida-linked fighters 'counter the principals that the Syrian revolution is trying to achieve'. The group also warns that the Islamic fighters are 'strengthening their positions' in opposition-controlled areas. The infighting threatens to further split opposition forces and could strengthen President Bashar Assad's hand. The comments came as Nick Clegg said Britain will look to press other . countries at the United Nations next week to provide more money to ease . the Syrian humanitarian crisis. The . Deputy Prime Minister, who leads the UK delegation to the UN's general . assembly in New York, warned not enough cash is being sent to the region . to help the millions of people displaced and 'traumatised' by the . conflict. Asked what proposals his government . would make at the forthcoming conference in Geneva, Mr Jamil said: 'An . end to external intervention, a ceasefire and the launching of a . peaceful political process in a way that the Syrian people can enjoy . self-determination without outside intervention and in a democratic . way.' Low resources: The Assad regime has claimed that neither side is capable of destroying the other . Mr . Jamil claimed the report by UN weapons inspectors into the use of . chemical weapons in Damascus was 'not thoroughly objective' and could . not be sure it was perpetrated by Assad. Mr Clegg was speaking after Oxfam suggested many large countries are contributing just a tiny fraction of their 'fair share' of cash needed to deal with the consequences of the crisis. The aid agency singled out governments which have been prominent in the diplomatic battle over Syria for failing to play their part in tackling the refugee crisis - including Russia and France. Calling for an end to the violence: Syria's deputy prime minister Qadri Jamil appeared to call for a ceasefire in his latest interview . The UK is contributing around £400 million. The UN's £3 billion appeal for money for Syria, the largest in its history, remains just 44 per cent funded three months after it was launched. Other international appeals are also struggling, with Oxfam 61 per cent short of its £30.7 million target. It is thought more than 100,000 people have been killed and seven million Syrians displaced.Mr Clegg said the conflict has inflicted 'incalculable' physical, mental and psychological traumas. Speaking to non-governmental organisations in London last night, Mr Clegg said: 'There is just not enough money being mobilised to deal with the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Syria. 'We have sought to take a lead. We are the second largest donor of humanitarian assistance, funded from the public purse, in Syria. Indignant: Syrian President Bashar al Assad used his latest televised interview to say that there is still no evidence that his soldiers used chemical weapons . Under attack: Assad maintained that the government was continually being attacked by outside terrorist groups who are masquerading as internal opposition forces . '(Prime Minister David Cameron) was very active on this in the recent G20 summit in St Petersburg, we've allocated another £50 million or so bringing the total of our humanitarian assistance to around £400 million. 'We are looking to other countries to increase their provision and their support as well, so we cannot only get the right means through access, not only the right focus - particularly on children - but also the right resources to help play a role... to do our best to provide humanitarian assistance to those millions and millions of people who have been displaced and traumatised by the conflict.' Mr Clegg said he wants to 'really hammer home' the focus on children. He said: 'The knock-on effects, the shadow which will be cast long into the future by the physical, mental, psychological traumas being inflicted on children now I think are incalculable and they need to be at the very heart of our thinking as we try and provide humanitarian assistance and help to this war-ravaged country.' Promise: Syrian President Bashar al Assad has vowed to destroy his country's stockpile of chemical weapons . Horror: Hundreds of children were killed in the attack which reportedly rained nerve gas upon thousands near the Syrian capital of Damascus .","Qadri Jamil claims civil war is at a stalemate as neither side is capable of beating the other .

"A court in Sweden has ruled that it is acceptable to masturbate in public as long as it is not directed at anyone. The ruling came in a landmark judgement following a case brought against a man seen touching himself on a beach. The 65-year-old man, who dropped his shorts close to the water at Drevviken beach, Stockholm, and started to masturbate, was initially charged with sexual assault. But in a surprise ruling, the Södertörn District Court acquitted the man. While the judgement stated it 'may be proven that the man exposed himself and masturbated on this occasion', it subsequently added that no offence had been committed. Södertörn District Court, pictured, has acquitted a man accused of sexual assault for masturbating on a beach, because it was not directed at anyone . It based its finding on the fact that the man was not pleasuring himself towards a specific person, according to Sweden's English language news website, The Local. Prosecutors held their hands up in agreement, underlining that the law calls for the act to be directed at another person to count as a crime. Public prosecutor Olof Vrethammar told the Mitti newspaper that he wasn't planning to appeal the ruling. He told the paper, quoted in The Local: 'For this to be a criminal offence it's required that the sexual molestation was directed towards one or more people. I think the court's judgement is reasonable.' The 65-year-old man was initially accused of sexual assault after he pleasured himself on an inland beach at Drevviken, near Stockholm, Sweden . The decision raises questions about whether public masturbation will now be acceptable across  Sweden, so long as it is not directed at another person. Mr Vrethammar appeared to think so, 'The district court has made a judgement on this case. With that we can conclude that it is okay to masturbate on the beach. The act may be considered to be disorderly conduct' he said. Sweden, like its Scandinavian neighbours, tends to have a more tolerant and sometimes progressive approach to social issues. In the UK, indecent exposure comes under The Sexual Offences Act 2003. It involves the public display of parts of the anatomy in a manner that may be offensive to others and morally unacceptable. Instances brought to court include people exposing themselves in a manner considered indecent and particularly offensive to others on trains, buses and other public areas. Masturbation or touching oneself in view of the public in a blatantly sexual manner is covered by the law. The test of decency or otherwise depends on the audience, the community rules and whether or not the exposure is intended to and/or does repel the public. Sunbathing for example, in few or even no clothes, is unlikely to cause offence and therefore constitute indecent exposure. If convicted, the most likely penalty is a fine and/or community service rather than a custodial sentence, although indecent exposure can result in a maximum jail term of 24 months, depending on the circumstances. But this landmark ruling raises concerns over the extent to which people will take advantage of the freedom to masturbate with impunity in public. Dr Liz Davies, a Reader in Child Protection at London Metropolitan University who has carried out research into Sweden's child protection system, said she thought this ruling was surprising. 'Sweden has a really robust child protection system and very rigorous investigation around sexual abuse. 'So this judgement is surprising given that such an act could be witnessed by children as well as adults' she said. The case comes hot on the heels of a recent similar judgement, in which a 15-year-old boy was acquitted of sexual assault after he threw his underwear into a lake and stood naked in front of two underage girls. Both girls had requested the boy be charged with molestation, but the Södertörn District Court ruled that his behaviour was not of a sexual nature so the charge was dismissed, according to The Local. In the UK anyone who masturbates in public or exposes themself in any way faces an indecent exposure charge.","Man, 65, acquitted of sexual assault after masturbating on beach .

"Charlie Trotter's wife has said that the famed chef had been given the go ahead by 'medical experts' to fly just days before his death in spite of previous warnings about how the increased pressure in the air would effect his brain aneurysm. Trotter was found dead in his Chicago home on Tuesday just days after returning from a culinary conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Rochelle Trotter has now put out a statement saying that her husband learned of his brain aneurysm in January and had been taking the 'proper medication. She denied the claims made in the police report from the officers who responded to Trotter's death, saying that they were wrong to say that he flew to Wyoming 'against medical advice'. Better days: Rochelle Trotter (left) said that her husband Charlie (right) learned about his brain aneurysm in January and had been treating it with the 'proper medication' at the time of his death . Mrs Trotter did not specifically say which doctors cleared him, but did say that 'medical experts' said it was fine for him to fly. 'The autopsy indicates the travel is not connected with his death,' she said. It is not clear how she knows that for a fact as the initial autopsy was concluded, proving that foul play or trauma were not part of the cause of death, but an exact cause is still unknown. The Medical Examiner is doing a full work up and that will not be completed for another eight weeks. A close friend has spoken out about how the 54-year-old chef had previously disclosed his medical condition. A sommelier who worked with Trotter and became a close friend over their years of working together said that doctors had told Trotter not to fly to avoid adding pressure to his brain. 'It was a time bomb, and he felt that he didn't have a lot of time left,' sommelier Larry Stone told The Chicago Tribune. Final appearance: Charlie Trotter spoke at a culinary conference and he flew to Wyoming to attend just three days before he was found dead . The last picture? Trotter spoke at a culinary conference in Jackson Hole and one audience member noticed that his left hand- seen in his pocket while posing with attendee Megan Gallagher- was shaking . 'It was inoperable, and it was not something that could be repaired; it was deep inside the brain.' Mr Stone told the paper that his 54-year-old former boss had multiple seizures in the time leading up to his death on Tuesday. The first hints of trouble came last year when he closed his eponymous, award-winning restaurant after 25 years, saying that he wanted to spend more time with his family and study philosophy. That didn't keep him from staying active, in spite of doctor's orders. Nothing . seemed particularly unusual about Trotter during the Jackson Hole conference, but . one audience member did notice that the chef's left hand was shaking . slightly as he held the microphone. Well-respected: Trotter won 10 coveted James Beard awards including the humanitarian award last year . Friends: Chef Anthony Bourdain (center left) and his wife Ottavia (right) hugs Trotter and his wife Rochelle Smith (center right) at a food event in Miami in February of last year . The chef's wife Rochelle was seen by neighbors screaming and crying hysterically as ambulances arrived at their home after Trotter's son Dylan found his father unconscious. 'He was much loved and words cannot describe how much he will be missed,' she said in a statement. 'His impact upon American cuisine and the culinary world at large will always be remembered.' Multi-course tasting menus that are now seen on many fine dining establishments were his handiwork, as he traded the 10-course menu at his flagship restaurant on a daily basis and boasted that frequent customers never had the same thing twice. He had a great influence on both the local and national food scene, one that many expect to be felt for years to come. Passed: Charlie Trotter's body, seen here in August 2012, was discovered by his son in their Chicago home . Wine was a passion for Trotter, and when asked at the event in Jackson Hole what he would like for his final meal, he said he wanted only the best: a bottle of 1900 Chateau Margaux, a wine that costs up to $16,000. During an interview when he decided to close his restaurant, he revealed his grand plans for what would happen to his restaurant's 26,000-strong wine cellar after it closed last year. 'I did a mathematical . calculation: If I live to the average life expectancy of the American . male — 78.9 — and I consume one bottle of wine every day, I should . consume the last bottle on my last day on this planet,' he said in an . interview with The New York Times.","Charlie Trotter, 54, was found dead in his Chicago home on Tuesday .

"The GOCE satellite, also known as the ‘Ferrari of space’, is expected to make a fiery fall to Earth sometime between the end of this month and the start of November. With a sleek, aerodynamic design responsible for it being dubbed the ‘Ferrari of space’, GOCE has mapped variations in Earth’s gravity with extreme detail. After more than four years on its mission, the one-tonne GOCE satellite will fall rapidly through the atmosphere, burning up as it descends. Scroll down for video... With a sleek, aerodynamic design responsible for it being dubbed the 'Ferrari of space', GOCE has mapped variations in Earth's gravity with extreme detail . Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer . Launched: 17 March 2009 . Number of instruments: 3 . Nominal life: 20 months . Mission cost: €350 million (£295 million) Orbit: about 260 km altitude, polar, Sun-synchronous . Mass: 1100 kg . Size: 5.3 m long, about 1m body diameter . This is the first uncontrolled re-entry of a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite since 1987. At a height of 224km, GOCE's orbit is so low that it experiences drag from the outer edges of . Earth's atmosphere. The satellite's streamline structure and use of . electric propulsion system counteract atmospheric drag to ensure that . the data are of true gravity. While most of GOCE will disintegrate in the atmosphere, ESA expects that around 25 per cent might reach Earth’s surface. When and where these parts might land cannot yet be predicted, but the affected area will be narrowed down closer to the time of re-entry. Taking into account that two thirds of Earth is covered by oceans and vast areas are thinly populated, the danger to life or property is very low. About 40 tonnes of manmade space debris reach the ground per year, but the spread and size mean the risk of an individual being struck is lower than being hit by a meteorite. The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) has been orbiting Earth since March 2009 at the lowest altitude of any research satellite. During its mission, it has produced a unique model of the ‘geoid’, which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another.

The colours in the image represent deviations in height from an ideal geoid. The blue shades represent low values and the reds/yellows represent high values . Around mid-October, the mission will come to a natural end when it runs out of fuel and the satellite begins its descent towards Earth from a height of about 224km. Re-entry is expected to happen about three weeks after the fuel is depleted. An international campaign is monitoring the descent, involving the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee. The situation is being continuously watched by the European Space Agency’s Space Debris Office, which will issue re-entry predictions and risk assessments.","GOCE has spent four years mapping Earth’s gravity with incredible precision .

"Younes Tsouli, 31, was jailed for 16 years in 2007 for distributing bomb-making instructions and has used Human Rights Act to appeal against deportation . A jailed terrorist who wrote a letter from a British prison proclaiming jihadis as ‘heroes’ is trying to avoid deportation from the UK on human rights grounds. Internet jihadi Younes Tsouli, 31 – who was once described as Al Qaeda’s most influential cyber-terrorist – was jailed for 16 years in 2007 for distributing bomb-making instructions as well as beheading videos on the internet. Tsouli, who called himself ‘Terrorist007’, was posting the material for Al Qaeda in Iraq. His prison term came to an end last November, but he was re-arrested and detained ahead of his release as prison officials found a copy of an Al Qaeda magazine in his cell. A hearing at the Old Bailey last week cleared Tsouli of unlawfully possessing the material, and he was due to be deported immediately back to his native Morocco. But he has appealed against his deportation on human rights grounds, applying for asylum to the UK under Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, which states no one should be subjected to ‘torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. It is believed that Tsouli had been active in the global cyber-jihadi scene since he moved to the UK to study IT at a London college in 2001. The cyber-terrorist used to hack into respectable websites and use them as hosts for videos including the beheading of British hostage Ken Bigley and Americans Daniel Pearl and Nick Berg. Tsouli set up a website called YouBombIt which he described as a ‘platform just like YouTube to post videos of bombings of Coalition forces’ in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has set up another called DeadZionists, and was in the process of setting up a third called Islamic Terrorism, when police raided his basement flat in Shepherd’s Bush in 2005. His websites and forums were being used by jihadis across the world to communicate. In July last year, the prison authorities intercepted a letter Tsouli had written to his father in Arabic, where he urged his family to join the jihad in Syria. In it he wrote: ‘This is a letter of advice to those members of my family who will learn their lesson and I hope that they are among those whom Allah has opened their hearts to what is good.’ Uncovered: Prison officials at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire found the magazine inside Tsouli's cell . He quoted a saying of the Prophet Mohammed, which said: ‘Allah gives rewards to those who go out for jihad out of conviction and belief in Allah and his prophets. To those Allah will grant either victory or paradise.’ He also mentioned a recent religious ruling which was a ‘call to arms’ in Syria, adding: ‘Prepare for the war since its flames are rising.’ The letter was read out during last week’s hearing, where Tsouli was accused of possessing a copy of Inspire in his cell in September last year, two months after the letter was intercepted. The court heard the forensic tests done on the magazine had revealed that it passed around the prison, as fingerprints belonging to a number of terrorist inmates – including Abdullah Ahmed Ali, the leader of the gang that tried to blow up airliners over the Atlantic – were found on it. However, Tsouli was cleared as he argued the magazine formed part of legal material. He is being kept in detention while the Home Office fights his bid to stay. Tsouli was accused of possessing a copy of Al Qaeda magazine Inspire in his cell in September last year . Jihadi John killed four US and UK hostages on camera under ISIS regime . A British jihadi who once hacked into the personal details of Tony Blair has tried to sell the identity of Jihadi John to The Mail on Sunday for £3,000. Junaid Hussain, 20, was jailed for six months in 2012 after publishing the former Prime Minister’s address and National Insurance number on the internet. In a series of online conversations, he told the MoS he would give us Jihadi John’s name and old Twitter details, with which we would be able to uncover his identity. Hussain, from Birmingham, said he needed the money to buy a car to move his family around IS stronghold Raqqa in Syria. He also claimed Jihadi John, pictured, who killed four US and UK hostages on camera, was of Arab origin, was born a Muslim and has been in Syria ‘for ages’. The Mail on Sunday refused to pay the money, and Scotland Yard has been informed.","Younes Tsouli, 31, was jailed for 16 years for posting videos for Al Qaeda .

"The final design of the new type of USB plug that will replace all other USB connectors, has been unveiled. The USB Type-C plug is reversible so users will no longer have to stab blindly at USB ports in order to connect and charge gadgets, because plugs will fit in sockets in either direction. The USB Promoter Group said that the next generation design is thinner than its predecessors so it can be used in increasing sleek smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks. The USB Promoter Group unveiled its USB Type-C plug which is reversible and slimmer than previous standards. Different types of ports are also pictured. The plug is designed for slimmer smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks but will not be compatible with older computer equipment without an adapter . The USB Type-C connector is a completely new design. It has been designed for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and ultrabooks. It claims to be robust enough for laptops and slim enough for smartphones. It is being built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies. The plug is smaller than current laptop connectors, and more closely resembles the size of the current 2.0 Micro USB. Crucially, it will be reversible meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in. This is similar to how Apple's Lightning connector works. ‘The USB Type-C specification establishes a new cable and connector scheme tailored to fit mobile device product designs, yet robust enough for laptops and tablets,’ the San Francisco-based group said. Reports of the fabled plug began in December last year and renderings of what it might look like leaked in April. The USB 2.0 specification was released in 2000 and became the standard by the end of 2001, followed by USB 3.0 in 2008, and 3.1 in July 2013. Apple uses its own Lightning Connector on newer models of iPhone and iPads, which can be inserted either way up. The Type-C connector will work in a similar way, while resembling the size of the current Micro USB plug. According to the group, the Type-C will be ‘the only connector one will need across all devices.’ In April, renderings were released shat showed a thinner USB dock, better suited for tablets and ultrabooks (illustrated). It is only now that the design and full specifications have been released . Crucially, however, because the new design is different to the current versions of USB plugs, users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use the new plugs. ‘Interest in the USB Type-C connector has not only been global, but cross-industry as well,’ said Brad Saunders, USB 3.0 Promoter Group Chairman. ‘Representatives from the PC, mobile, automotive and internet of things industries have been knocking down our door anticipating this new standard.' It is anticipated that everyday devices connected to the internet, from smart light bulbs to smart fridges will become increasingly common in years to come, as more consumers embrace the internet of things. 'This specification is the culmination of an extensive, cooperative effort among industry leaders to standardise the next generation USB connector as a long-lasting, robust solution,’ he added. The new cable and connector supports USB performance at SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps (gigabits per second) and provide up to 100W of power.","The USB Promoter Group unveiled its slimmer USB Type-C plug .

"Archaeologists in South America have discovered the first undisturbed tomb of the ancient and mysterious Wari civilisation, unearthing the mummified bodies of three Queens alongside golden treasures and macabre human sacrifices. The 1,200-year-old 'temple of the dead' was found at the El Castillo de Huarmey site, a four-hour drive north of the Pruvian capital Lima. It provides a wealth of information about the enigmatic Wari empire that ruled the Andes long before their better-known Incan successors. Scroll down for video . Treasures: A pair of gold-and-silver ear ornaments found alongside what  archaeologists believe were three Queens of the ancient and mysterious Wari civilisation . An unusually designed 1,200-year-old ceramic flask depicting a Wari lord with eyes wide open, was among a wealth of ceramic artifacts discovered in the tomb . The tomb was discovered at the El Castillo de Huarmey site four hours north of the Peruvian capital Lima . 'For the first time in the history of archeology in Peru we have found an imperial tomb that belongs to the Wari empire and culture,' lead archeologist Milosz Giersz, of the joint Polish-Peruvian team, said. Researchers said the discovery will help them piece together life in the Andes centuries before the rise of the Incan empire, which was written about in detail by the conquering Spaniards. The mausoleum, unearthed a few months ago at a coastal pyramid site contained gold pieces, ceramics and 63 skeletons about 1,300 years old. Scene: The undisturbed tomb was found at the El Castillo de Huarmey site, 299 km north from Lima, which for decades has been raided by tomb robbers .

Royal bones: An archaeologist measures the skull of one of the Wari women whose mummified bodies were discovered among a wealth of jewellery and other treasures . Examination: The archaeological team has found the remains of three Wari queens as well as 63 other skeletons about 1,300 years old . Regal pose: The mummified women were discovered sitting upright - indicating royalty and suggesting Wari women held more power than previously thought . Researchers said most of the bodies . found in the burial chamber were mummified women sitting upright - . indicating royalty and suggesting Wari women held more power than . previously thought.The Wari, who came from Peru’s southern highlands and ruled a vast area of the country from 500 to 1000 AD, conducted multiple burials and sent their loved ones into the afterlife with provisions and the tools of their trade. 'The . women were buried with finely engraved ear pieces made of precious . metals that once were believed to be used only by men,' archaeologist . Patrycja Przadk said. Among . the other artfacts discopvered alongside the mummfied queens were . weaving tools made of gold, ritual kinives and axes, drinking cups, coca . leaf containers and an array of beautifully decorated ceramics. Two workers walk on the coastal pyramid site called El Castillo de Huarmey in Huarmey, 185 miles north of Lima . Exciting find: A worker brushes dirt from around one of the mummies skulls with locks of hair still intact . Skulls belonging to women from the Wari empire are placed in boxes after being discovered at a pyramid site . An archaeologist measures the remains of a woman believed to be a Wari queen . Macabre: Skeletons, believed to be human sacrifices thrown into the tomb moments before it was sealed, were found alongside the mummified remains . Historians believe the Wari, who ruled between 600 and 1100 A.D., were the first people to unite diverse tribes into a sophisticated network across most of today's Peruvian Andes. Bioarchaeologist Wieslaw Wieckowski said six skeletons were not wrapped in textiles and appear to have been human sacrifices for the mummified elite. 'They were people thrown into the grave before the grave was sealed,' he said. 'They were lying on their bellies, in an extended position and their limbs went in different directions.' Archaeologists told National Geographic that they kept their work quiet for fear grave robbers would pick the site clean.","Wari empire ruled the Andes before their better-known Incan successors .

"Warm water is brewing in the Pacific, resurrecting claims that a much-anticipated El Niño may be on its way. El Niño - a heating of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific - affects wind patterns and can trigger both floods and droughts in different parts of the globe. Now, for the first time, scientists have mapped how flood risks change across the world when an extreme El Niño hits the oceans. Scroll down for video . For the first time, scientists have mapped how flood risks change when an extreme El Niño hits the oceans. Pictured is the percentage of land experiencing changes in flood volume with return periods of 100 years, during El Niño years (top) and La Niña years (bottom) Their study shows how some areas are exposed to dangerous floods that can damage buildings, put people's lives at danger, while other areas get a reprieve from drought. 'A lot of scientific effort has been put into modelling physical hazards themselves,' Philip Ward, who led the new study told Discovery News. 'Only much more recently have we started looking at the damage and being able to model that damage.' According to a report by Roz Pidcock at Carbon Brief, the latest map was created using detailed hydrological models. Pictured is the percentage of land experiencing changes in economic damages during El Nino years (top) and La Nina years (bottom). In El Niño years, 10 per cent of the globe sees higher than normal damages, while 19 per cent sees lower than normal . El Niño and La Niña are opposite phases of what is known as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (Enso) cycle, says the NOAA. The Enso cycle is a scientific term that describes the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific (approximately between the International Date Line and 120 degrees West). La Niña is sometimes referred to as the cold phase of Enso and El Niño as the warm phase. These deviations from normal surface temperatures can have large-scale impacts not only on ocean processes, but also on global weather and climate. El Niño and La Niña episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some prolonged events may last for years. They often begin to form between June and August, reach peak strength between December and April, and then decay between May and July of the following year. While their periodicity can be quite irregular, El Niño and La Niña events occur about every three to five years. Typically, El Niño occurs more frequently than La Niña. Researchers at Amsterdam's Global Change Institute compared the amount of flooding in El Niño and La Niña years to the average from all years between 1958 to 2000. The study also looked at its opposite phase, La Niña, which occurs when winds in the equatorial Pacific causes a shift to cooler than normal ocean temperatures. It found that 44 per cent of river basins around the world saw changes in 100-year flood risks during El Niño or La Niña years. In one map, around 34 per cent of the world's land area experiences a change in the amount of flooding in El Niño years, compared to 38 per cent in La Niña years. The biggest increases in flood risk were found in southwest United States, parts of southern South America and the Horn of Africa. Meanwhile, the Sahel region of Africa and most of Australia saw the biggest decreases in flood risks. The researchers also looked at how the weather pattern cause economic damage caused by flooding. In El Niño years, 10 per cent of the globe sees higher than normal damages, while 19 per cent sees lower than normal. The red colour in the map below shows regions where flooding decreases in El Niño or La Niña years. A darker the red, the lower the risk compared to normal. 'There have been studies [showing] that some areas get more rainfall during El Niño years, but more rainfall doesn't necessarily mean more floods,' Professor Ward said. 'So we're looking at the actual flooding and damages caused by flooding.' These don't always match an increase in rainfall. For instance, the southeast of the US is often cooler and wetter during an El Niño, but the impact of flooding as a whole wasn't severe. Scientists recently suggested that Ecuador is about to be hit by eastward-moving waves of warm water, suggesting that El Niño may be on its way. The most recent waves increase the chances that parched California could be in for some relief - albeit small - if weather patterns take a turn later this year. But Nasa has warned that 'fickle' El Niño will likely be weak if it does appear, providing only limited relief for a drought-ridden west coast. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so. On the left, the village of Puerto Maldonado, Peru, is seen flooded in January 2003 as a result of El Niño rains, which drove 16,000 people from their homes. The worst El Niño on record in 1997 to 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along China's Yangtze river, right, that killed over 1,500 people . Kelvin waves of high sea level (red/yellow) are seen crossing the Pacific Ocean at the equator. The waves may be due to El Niño events. Green indicates normal sea level, and blue/purple areas are lower than normal .","El Niño - a heating of sea temperatures in the Pacific - affects winds and can trigger both floods and droughts .

"A flowering process 80 years in the making is finally underway. An American agave plant housed at the University of Michigan since 1934 has started to bloom. The blooms so far are 'low-key' with yellow anthers sticking out, Joe Mooney, a spokesman for Matthaei Botanical Gardens, said Wednesday. Housed at the University of the Michigan since 1934, the plant has grown so rapidly since the spring that at more than 27 feet it is now too tall for the Ann Arbor conservatory, which has had to remove a pane of glass to accommodate it. The variegated American agave (Agave americana) was collected in Mexico by famed ethno-botanist Alfred Whiting, who then was a University of Michigan graduate student. Known as the century plant because it blooms infrequently, it is native to Mexico and the American Southwest and typically lives 10 to 25 years in the wild before blooming a single time then dying. American agave foliage is usually 3 to 6 feet tall and 6 to 10 feet wide. The flower stalk can reach up to 30 feet tall. The anther is the part of the stamen where pollen is produced. The agave began sprouting up at a pace of 6 inches a day in the spring and now stands at more than 27 feet — so tall that staff had to remove a panel in the glass roof of the Ann Arbor conservatory. The variegated American agave (Agave americana) was collected in Mexico by famed ethno-botanist Alfred Whiting, who then was a University of Michigan graduate student. Known as the century plant because it blooms infrequently, it is native to Mexico and the American Southwest and typically lives 10 to 25 years in the wild before blooming a single time then dying. Now that the Michigan agave has begun to bloom, Matthaei horticulture manager Mike Palmer said he plans to reach out to his colleagues out West. The variegated American agave (Agave americana) was collected in Mexico by famed ethno-botanist Alfred Whiting, who then was a University of Michigan graduate student. 'I'm going to call the Desert Botanical Garden (in Phoenix) and ask for a firsthand description of what happens during the flower opening,' Palmer said. Mooney said it was difficult to predict how the flower will look in full bloom because the plant is so old and has lived its life in a conservatory rather than in a hot desert. Once the agave completes the flowering process, it will take many months before it dies. The bad news, especially for anyone who’s seen this enormous plant in the conservatory or in nature with its sinuous yellow-streaked leaves bristling with spikes, is that the plant will bloom, set seed and die, says Mike Palmer, horticulture manager at Matthaei Botanical Gardens & Nichols Arboretum. According to Palmer the American agave usually blooms in nature at 10 to 25 years of age. The Agave bllom up close, left, and the plant poking through the roof - which had to have a glass panel removed . 'Although no one knows for sure what combination of environmental conditions induces flowering,' he said. 'And it’s rare for one to bloom indoors. Of course, being in a conservatory helps!' American agave foliage is usually 3 to 6 feet tall and 6 to 10 feet wide. The flower stalk can reach up to 30 feet tall. Thankfully, life will go on for the Botanical Gardens’ variegated agave, Palmer points out. 'While it’s sad that the parent plant will die, it also grows ‘pups’ on the flower stalk and offsets at the base that are identical clones of the original plant,' he says. And it produces hundreds or even thousands of seeds that have the potential to grow. 'In the harsh, low water environment of the desert,' explains Palmer, 'plants must produce many offspring to get a few progeny that will reach adulthood.'

"Britain's skies will be filled with  drones within ten years, according to one of the government's top aviation chiefs. The sight of unmanned aircraft could become common place by 2023 once a 'detect and avoid' system is in place to ensure they can join the country's crowded airspace. The technology will be used increasingly for surveillance purposes and by delivery firms in a move that could revolutionise the way we shop, according to Paul Cremin, the head of aviation safety at the Department for Transport. Scroll down for video . Drones could become a common sight in Britain's skies within ten years, an aviation chief has been claimed . The Times quotes him as saying: 'There are a number of civilian applications for this technology. I hear of a new one almost every day. 'People are becoming resourceful, in the same way as when the internet came on the scene and people were looking at different ways to use that technology. 'We hear a lot of stories about Amazon delivering goods to your door and I am sure there will be a lot more use of this (technology).' Amazon created a media frenzy in December 2013 when it outlined a plan to deliver packages with self-guided aircrafts. In August, it was reported that the online retailer was asking the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to use drones as part of its plan to deliver packages to customers in 30 minutes or less. The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5lbs. About 86 percent of Amazon's deliveries are 5lbs or less, the company said. Project Wing's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m (4.9ft) and have four electrically-driven propellers. The total weight, including the package to be delivered, is approximately 10kg (22lb). The aircraft itself accounts for the bulk of that at 8.5kg (18.7lb). The hybrid 'tail sitter' design has wings for fast forward flight, and rotors for hovering for delivery and vertical take-off and landing. Project Wing's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m (4.9ft) and have four electrically-driven propellers . Dual mode operation gives the self-flying vehicle some of the benefits of both planes and helicopters. It can take off or land without a runway, and can hold its position hovering in one spot to gently drop packages. Packages are stored in the drone's 'belly' then dropped on a string before being gently lowered to the ground. At the end of the tether, there is a bundle of electronics the team call the 'egg,' which detects that the package has hit the ground, detaches from the delivery, and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle. In the same month it was revealed that Google has built and tested self flying drones designed to deliver packages. Called Project Wing, it is being developed at Google X, the company's secret research lab. The firm says the drones could eventually be used for disaster relief by delivering aid to isolated areas - and for package delivery. Separate trials have taken place to test their effectiveness in crop spraying and in conservation by tracking the movement of animals. There are also hopes they could help to speed up the delivery of donor organs and monitor traffic and transport networks. The technology will be used increasingly for surveillance purposes and by delivery firms in a move that could revolutionise the way we shop . In April, it was revealed how criminals were using cheap kit bought from supermarkets to build heat seeking drones they can use to track down cannabis farms. Tech-savvy thieves were reportedly buying drones for as little as £60 from supermarkets  and attaching infra-red cameras to them, which they can monitor via an iPad. By flying the modified drones over houses, they can locate the drug dens, as cannabis farms produce a large amount of heat. Burglars were said to be breaking in to the premises and stealing the crop to sell on the streets. The Times reports that  the House of Lords EU internal market, infrastructure and employment sub-committee this week discussed the question of whether there was a need for EU-wide drone legislation. Mark Steyn from onDrone, a London-based company that sells custom drones, said use of the unmanned craft will increase over the next decade. He said: 'Next year there is going to be limited use of driverless cars on the road. As people get used to that, the concept of having some little flying machine that comes to deliver you something will not be that far fetched.'","Drones could become common sight in Britain by 2023, it has been claimed .

"Decades after mysteriously disappearing, 'The Iceman Cometh' again. The infamous 'Minnesota Iceman' will be exhibited at Museum of the Weird in Austin, Texas, starting next week after touring at fairgrounds and malls across the country in the late 60s and early 70s. The museum's owner, Steve Busti, said Wednesday that the frozen, 'Neanderthal or Bigfoot-like monster' will be on display beginning July 3. Resurfaced: After decades missing, the 'Minnesota Iceman' is going to be on display at Museum of the Weird in Austin, Texas . On display: Museum of the Weird owner, Steve Busti, pictured, bought the iceman from the family of its original exhibitor . The iceman, 6-feet-tall, was billed as 'The Siberskoye Creature' or 'The Creature of Ice' beginning in 1968. The hairy creature was displayed in a solid block of ice inside a refrigerated coffin. A man named Frank Hansen exhibited the iceman and claimed to have been behind its discovery, according to the book 'Bigfoot Exposed: An Anthropologist Examines America's Enduring Legend'. Two cryptozoologists, Ivan Sanderson and Bernard Heuvelmans, examined the body during their search for evidence of Bigfoot the same year the iceman became a carnival exhibit. The pair believed the creature to be a real, unknown species, with Sanderson even remarking he could smell a decomposing corpse through cracks in the icy tomb. Frozen: Encased in ice, the hairy beast was originally exhibited by Frank Hansen, who first said he discovered it in Siberia, but later said he shot it in Minnesota . The pair believed the creature to be an evolutionary missing link--Heuvelmans even dubbed him 'Homo pongoides'. After the two cryptozoologists examined the creature, Sanderson convinced someone at the Smithsonian Institution to launch an official investigation. Unfortunately, Hansen reportedly switched the 'real' body with a latex dummy before an investigation took place. At first, Hansen suggested he found the iceman in Siberia, but he confessed he shot the creature in Minnesota woods before putting it on ice. As a result of these new claims, the FBI almost became involved, thinking Hansen had been exhibiting a murder victim. Bigfoot: The Minnesota Iceman has been billed as similar to Bigfoot, supposedly seen in this famous frame from a 1967 film . When the Smithsonian assessed the Iceman--after Hansen said he switched it with a dummy--the museum stated it was 'satisfied that the creature is simply a carnival exhibit made of latex rubber and hair...the ""original"" model and the present so-called ""substitute"" are one and the same', according to 'Bigfoot Exposed'. Investigators with the Smithsonian also discovered a company on the West Coast made Hasen an iceman in 1967, but whether or not it was just a replica of the 'real' iceman. The company Hansen commissioned to make the dummy never saw an original. After touring through the early 70s, the creature and its eccentric owner remained out of the public eye until 10 years ago, The Huffington Post reported. After investigating its whereabouts for two years, Busti tracked down Hansen's family and bought the frozen beast or rubber impersonation, depending on who's talking. Mystery: The iceman is also akin to Sasquatch, possibly seen in this 2007 photograph taken in Pennsylvania .","Museum of the Weird in Austin will display the mysterious creature beginning July 3 .

"Like any girl of her age, Emma Cahill loves to wear heels. However, shopping for them is pretty tricky. That's because the 19-year-old, from Worcester, has one of the biggest pairs of feet of any woman in Europe - and at size 14, she has only ever found shoes that fit her at a shop in Germany. The 6ft 5in Oxford Brookes University student, who is double the UK women’s average size of seven, owns one pair of stilettos but finds it ‘impossible’ to find the right shoes. Scroll down for video . Size 14: Emma Cahill (left), 19, of Worcester, is thought to have the biggest feet of any woman in Europe. She is pictured (right) posing with Rachel Daly, 19, who has a shoe size of three and stands at 5ft 3in tall . Compared: Miss Cahill, 19, who is a foot size 14, is pictured with her friend Miss Daly, who has a size of three . She said: ‘I think I’ve got the biggest feet in Europe, which makes it impossible to find shoes that fit. I own one pair of stilettos - but they’re not very classy. I dream of owning a pair of Louboutins.’ Miss Cahill - whose feet are larger than those of 6ft 7in England footballer Peter Crouch, a size 12 - said wearing heels puts her at 7ft, and men are often too intimidated to speak to her when she is out. She added: ‘Although I love being tall, I’ve only been approached once in a club - and that was by a man who was taller than me. ‘Besides our mutual height, we didn’t have much in common. I’d rather date a man who is taller than me, but I realise that I may be raising the bar too high.’ All Star trainers: Miss Cahill measures up her size 14 feet with friend Miss Daly, who has a size three . Height difference: Seen with her friend Miss Daly, Miss Cahill said her heels put her at 7ft, and men are often too intimidated to speak to her when she is out . Problems that Miss Cahill encounters daily include fitting into cars and banging her head on door frames. She is even considering putting pipe insulator on frames in her home to prevent injury. 'I was so relieved when my feet stopped growing. I was terrified I’d end up with boat feet' Emma Cahill . Meanwhile she faces wardrobe problems. Finding clothes that fit is a constant battle and she is often forced to wear leggings underneath dresses which come up too short on her. ‘The biggest issue is finding shoes that fit me,' she said. 'I love shoes and it’s so hard getting ones I like. There’s only one place I can buy them in Germany. Last time I went I spent £500 on five pairs.’ From the age of nine she wore a bigger-than-average size nine - the same size feet as her mum Jane, 49 - and up to the age of 14 she grew a shoe size every year. She even beats Crouchy: The feet of Miss Cahill (right in left photo, pictured with her friend Miss Daly) are even bigger than those of 6ft 7in Stoke City and England footballer Peter Crouch (right, pictured on Saturday) She said: ‘I was so relieved when my feet stopped growing.

Jenni is a 10 - added that her feet don’t look that big because they are in . proportion with her height. Trousers . are out of the question for Miss Cahill, so three-quarter length jeans . with a long top are her preferred outfit. Meanwhile the teenager is . limited to just one pair of shoes for evenings out.

She said: ‘I try to keep up with the trends, but when you have to base an outfit around the same pair of shoes, it’s not easy. ‘I don’t know what I’ll do when they finally give in - I guess I’ll have to plan another trip to the shop in Germany. Last time I went, when I was 13-years-old, I was a size 13, but my feet have grown so I’ve stretched the shoes. ‘The shop only stocks up to a size 13, but the shoemaker says he can make footwear especially for me in a size 14.

"This brings new weight to the term 'chasing rainbows', because chasing this colour spectrum would literally mean running in circles. During a recent trip over Cottesloe Beach in Western Australia, 46-year-old aerial photographer Colin Leonhardt happened upon a rare natural phenomenon. 'The pilot and I were on our way back from shooting a grand final AFL match in rural Perth. It was raining softy, and the sun was peering through the clouds. 'As we went through the trailing edge of the rain, the sun was low and setting and the sunlight just created this amazing rainbow. It just evolved in front of us.' Stunning: 46-year-old aerial photographer Colin Leonhardt happened upon the rare natural phenomenon on his  way back from shooting an AFL match in rural Perth . Think quick: Leonhardt took over 50 images for the five minutes it remained a complete full circle rainbow . According to NASA, the full circle rainbow is 'an observer dependent phenomenon primarily caused by the internal reflection of sunlight by raindrops' 'I had never heard of it before, not to mention seeing one in person. We looked at each other and said 'what the hell is that?' Leonhardt says he trusted his instincts on how to capture the moment. 'My experience with this sort of thing is to shoot first, then ask questions. I starting snapping like there was no tomorrow.' He took over 50 images for the five minutes it remained a complete full circle rainbow. 'Once we reached the beach, a big burst of light came through and the whole thing really lit up. Then it faded as quickly as it came.' 'As soon as I got home, I started researching. Basically it's a very rare phenomenon that relies on specific conditions. 'It needs to be low sun-so early mornings or evenings-and it has to be straight after a storm, with light coming through the rain.' When Leonhadt uploaded the images online, they spread like wildfire. Leonhardt received a spate of emails from scientists and astronomers who said they had 'never seen anything like it' Leonhardt (right) says he probably wouldn't attempt to  find the circle ranbow a second time due to the exorbitant costs of aerial photography . Apart from getting media attention from all over the world, Leonhardt was also contacted by a wealth of scientists and astronomers-including none other than NASA. 'I received a bunch of emails from people in those fields. They were so excited, they said they had never seen anything like it. 'Next thing I knew, I got an email from NASA. They wanted to use my image for their Astonomy Pic of the Day. I thought 'why not?'' According to NASA, the full circle rainbow is 'an observer dependent phenomenon primarily caused by the internal reflection of sunlight by raindrops.' When asked if thought he would try to chase the rainbow down a second time, Leonhadt said 'in the end of the day, aerial photography isn't cheap. 'It costs $1000 every time you want to get up there. With how rare these things are and how difficult it would be to replicate the moment, I'm not sure if I could justify a second time.'","Aerial photographer Colin Leonhardt captured a circle rainbow when flying over Cottesloe Beach .

"Given the choice, World War II veteran Phillip Coon probably wouldn't want the formality and fuss of being honored on a military base with men and women standing at attention, dressed in full regalia — even if it was with a fistful of long-overdue medals he waited decades to receive. So it's fitting that the awards were presented to the humble Tulsa-area man Monday evening in an informal ceremony at the Tulsa International Airport, with family and fellow veterans in attendance and little pomp and circumstance. The 94-year-old survivor of a POW labor camp and the Bataan Death March received the Prisoner of War Medal, Bronze Star and the Combat Infantryman Badge after he and his son, Michael, returned from a trip to Japan to promote understanding and healing with the U.S. Scroll down for video . Hero: Phillip Coon, 94, finally received the Prisoner of War Medal, Bronze Star and the Combat Infantryman Badge for service in World War II . Humble: 'I've been blessed to come this far in life,' Coon said, a tear streaming down one cheek. 'I thank the Lord for watching over me.' A couple of dozen people applauded wildly after the medals were presented to Coon, who was seated in a wheelchair. He lifted his ball cap in recognition, exposing a shock of silver hair. 'I've been blessed to come this far in life,' he said, a tear streaming down one cheek. 'I thank the Lord for watching over me.' Japan's Foreign Ministry said Coon visited the site of the former POW camp in Kosaka next to a now defunct copper mine where he was put to forced labor. The veteran also met the mayor and other officials in Kosaka, in Japan's northern prefecture of Akita. Coon, who lives in Sapulpa in northeastern Oklahoma, served as an infantry machine gunner in the Army. He is also a survivor of the Bataan Death March in the Philippines in 1942, when the Japanese military forced tens of thousands of American and Filipino soldiers to trek for 65 miles with little food or water in blazing heat. As many as 11,000 died along the way. POW: Coon spent time in a torturous POW camp in Kosaka, Japan, after surviving the Bataan Death March . It's not clear why Coon didn't get his medals before now, but such occurrences with awards are not uncommon in the military. 'It continues to trouble me that there are instances where service members do not receive the service medals they have earned through the course of their careers,' said U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe, whose office contacted the military three weeks ago about the missing medals. 'But It is extremely rewarding for me and my staff to be able to help veterans and active-duty members receive the honors they have fought for.' Retired Maj. Gen. Rita Aragon, Oklahoma's secretary of military and veterans' affairs, said most veterans were — rightly — more focused on reuniting with their families than chasing after military ribbons when they returned after the war. Aragon presented the medals to Coon during the airport ceremony. Death March: Coon survived the Bataan Death March at the hands of the Japanese. 11,000 people were killed during the march . Tulsa veteran David Rule, who served in the Vietnam War, helped Coon and his family to find out why his medals hadn't been issued. For the past 10 years or so, Rule has helped recognize about 150 area veterans by memorializing their names, ranks and branches of service on granite plaques that are presented to them and their families. 'I have a passion for these servicemen,' Rule said earlier Monday. 'They just sacrificed so much. It doesn't matter to me whether they were a cook or a four-star general, just for them to get this million-dollar smile on their face when they know they aren't forgotten.'","Phillip Coon, 94,  served as an infantry machine gunner in the Army during World War II .

"Disgraced ex-Mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner's sexting partner Sydney Leathers has hit the beach wearing a stars and strips bikini . It comes just days after the former congressman marked a disastrous conclusion of his mayoral campaign. But Miss Leathers, who gatecrashed his concession party on Tuesday night, appeared not to have a care in the world as she walked along the Miami beachfront with a smile on her face. Disgraced ex-Mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner's sexting partner Sydney Leathers has hit the beach wearing a stars and strips bikini . It comes just days after the former congressman marked a disastrous conclusion of his mayoral campaign. But Miss Leathers, who gatecrashed his concession party on Tuesday night, appeared not to have a care in the world . The 23-year-old seems to be relishing the 'fame' which she has been afforded since she revealed that Mr Weiner had continued exchanging X-rated messages with her, long after his . resignation from the U.S. Congress. She has starred in her own porn film, and is said to be releasing a single called 'Weinerizer' - a play on Britney Spears' Womaniser - which she has been desperately trying to promote. She has been held to blame for Mr Weiner's disastrous defeat in the Democratic primaries, finishing his run with only 5 per cent. Mr Weiner - or 'Carlos Danger' as he is now well known thanks to the alias he used in the online encounters -  was once the front runner for the race but his campaign imploded when it emerged he had continued his sexting habit even after he had reconciled with his wife. Just hours after suffering a crushing defeat in the Democratic primaries, Anthony Weiner emerged from his apartment with a grin on his face and looking relaxed . Casual: Dressed in a white checkered button-down shirt and dark jeans, Mr Weiner appeared relaxed and in good spirits outside his home . Sporting a casual white checkered button-down shirt and dark jeans, Mr Weiner grinned and appeared animated while being photographed outside his home following his defeat. On Wednesday, there was also a sighting of Mr Weiner's better half, Huma Abedin, who chose to skip his concession party the night before in favor of a Hamptons getaway – and in the process avoided running into her husband’s sexting partner. The mayoral candidate's wife emerged from the couple's tony apartment building this morning dressed to impress in a mint-green dress with a Louis Vuitton bag on her shoulder, and attempted to hail a cab, the New York Daily News reported. Miss Abedin largely disappeared from the public eye following revelations that her husband had continue exchanging X-rated messages with Sydney Leathers long after his resignation from the U.S. Congress. She's back: Huma Abedin, pictured here on August 27, emerged from the couple's apartment building this morning in a mint-green dress with a Louis Vuitton bag on her shoulder . Weiner concluded his race by showing the middle finger to the reporters who covered his scandal-ridden campaign. His wife Huma Abedin was not looking on as he gave his concession, and he didn't even thank his long-plagued wife in his remarks. Abedin was said to be hundreds of miles away in the Hamptons on Tuesday night but spotted coming out of the couple's Manhattan apartment Wednesday morning. Rather than bowing out gracefully, Weiner decided to throw one final insult at the voters by flipping his middle finger at the crowd as he drove off as captured by NY1 photographers. Instead of having his wife at the midtown bar where he and his supporters gathered Tuesday night, a different woman was attracting attention: Sydney Leathers, the woman with whom he had a sexting relationship, crashed his party. 'Sadly we did not win this time, but I . could not be more proud of the campaign that we ran,' Weiner said to . the crowd inside Connolly's Irish Pub just before 11 p.m., accepting his . defeat with just 5 percent of the vote. 'I . could not be more proud of you.' He went on: 'We had the best ideas. Sadly, I was an imperfect messenger.' Leathers was seen wandering around the pub- clearly as an uninvited  guest- giving statements to reporters . and showing off her widely publicized plastic surgeries including a breast augmentation and a nose job. Her presence delayed the evening's festivities as it took Weiner half an hour to avoid a confrontation and run through a nearby fast food restaurant. After stepping down from Congress in 2011 following his first sexting scandal, Weiner was . hoping that his campaign for mayor would be his chance to reenter public . office and clear his name. The July revelations that he continued having inappropriate online relationships with women, including Leathers. Weiner makes his concession speech, saying  'We had the best ideas.

Different kind of support: Sydney Leathers was using the primary attention to promote her new song . New Yorkers also voted against . another scandal-plagued politician on Tuesday as former New York . Governor Eliot Spitzer lost his race for city comptroller. Even . though he and Weiner were dealt the similar losses, Spitzer had a much . more successful campaign as he came within 4 points of Scott Stringer, . the former Manhattan Borough President who has worked in state politics . for the past two decades. Stringer had a . 52-percent-to-48-per cent lead over Spitzer in unofficial . returns, with 92 percent of precincts reporting. 'I am proud to have run a campaign . over the past nine weeks that many thought was incapable to mount,' Spitzer said in his concession speech. 'We did it in a way that made me . proud to revisit the issues we fought for when I was attorney general . and governor, to lay out an agenda of what we believed was right for . this great city.' Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer delivers his concession speech at his election night party .

Spitzer - who like Weiner, is married - was forced to resign five years ago after he admitted to hiring prostitutes. His wife Silda Spitzer was not at the Tuesday night event and never made any campaign appearances during his nine-week bid for comptroller. 'All along we knew it was going to be a close race,' Spitzer campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith told MailOnline at his party Tuesday night. 'Yes people know Eliot and he has name recognition but Scott Stringer has the entire political establishment behind him- every union, every business.' Striking a clear contrast to his failed colleagues, Bill de Blasio danced and blew simultaneous kisses to the crowd with his wife and two children at their victory party in Gowanus, Brooklyn. De Blasio won 40.2 per cent of the Democratic vote, and while there is a chance of a run off between him and the second place candidate, Bill Thompson, that seems unlikely.

"We readily sit down to watch TV, or read books, or listen to music on the radio. But there is one sense we rarely record and play back - the sense of smell - even if we can all recall our favourite scents, such as the smell of coffee in the morning, a freshly-cut lawn or the salty bracing smell of sea air. Now, graphic designer and photographer Kate McLean has been combining her love of maps with her desire to explore our overlooked sense, leading to 'sensory maps' of cities around the world. Each map is a labour of love as well as a lot of labour, with Kate moving around each city, meeting the people who live and work in the various districts, and then capturing and re-creating the smells she encounters to create the maps. Her experiences have led her to the fishermen of the River Clyde in Glasgow, who occasionally have to pull bodies from the water, to the 'smelliest' block of New York, as well as the olfactory delights of Paris and the fresh sea air of Newport in Rhode Island. All have all come under the keen observation of her nose, and found their way into her maps. Paris, distilled: Kate builds a map of each city, guided by her own experiences and the observations of local people . Kate . says her aim is to sensitize tourists and visitors to a new place, and . use a 'largely-ignored sense in their perception of that place'. She . said: 'Smell has a ""do not enter brain processing"" connection with our . emotions, making smell the supreme retainer of memory over our other . senses. 'We have 100 per cent smell recall after one year but only 30 per cent sight memory after three months. 'The . first time we smell a new scent we automatically associate it with . whether we like it or not (positive or negative) and we associate it . with the location where we smell it. 'Therefore I propose that smell can be used in tourism marketing to foster lasting memories of a place.' How does Glasgow smell to you? Scents picked up by Kate McLean include perfume, fast food, building dust and 'hot bovril at the footy' Speaking to her alumni publication for Suffolk University, she said: 'Maps are an old graphic device of data visualization. 'Maps . show proximity, range, location – all characteristics of smell that are . difficult to explain verbally in any kind of a coherent way. 'Moreover I have been fascinated by maps since I was a small child. 'I . wanted to make maps but realized, at ten years of age, that the world . had already been discovered. So, if the physical, geographical world has . been represented then I just had to discover a new territory – my . landscape is the smell-scape.' New York's smelliest block: Cabbage, car oil, dried fish, cheap perfume and A/C all combine to make this a smell to remember . Kate started with Paris 'because it has astonishing emotion-inducing scents. 'The . Paris smell map is a virtual dérive, a collection of perfumes placed on . shelving on a board showing Parisian streets. Audience members walk a . pace at a time to sniff as they ""wander"" the city’s streets. 'I . moved on to Edinburgh. That city has one pervasive smell – identified . as malt extract from the breweries – which sweeps the city’s streets, . but the secondary smells are equally evocative. 'The . maps themselves do not smell; instead I make up individual scents using . only natural ingredients that best reflect the smells I have selected . to depict visually. 'Each . scent is stored in its own bottle which is stored in a small cabinet . underneath the map. I prefer to keep the contents of the bottles hidden . so that the audience cannot rely on visual cues to identify the smells. 'For . this reason I do not label the smells. I make most of the smells . myself, trying to capture and hold elusive scents in the small bottles.

"A company is charging people more than $200,000 to be frozen after they die, and the chance to be brought back to life by future technologies. Although the American company is quite open about the fact that there is no known way to revive the bodies, they sell this service based on the fact that future generations may have the answer. In 1990 Roy Schiavello from Melbourne died at age 30 while on the operating table. He was transported to the US. He was being operated for a brain tumor, he became Australia's first cryonic patient and is now being stored in Alcor's facilities until the technology to revive him is discovered. For $200k you too could be frozen when you kick the bucket to possibly tbe revived in years to come (stock image) The process they use is called cyronic preservation, it is similar to the one used to preserve blood cells, embyros, sperm and stem cells. British-Australian comedian Ugly Dave Gray is one of the many Aussies who have put their hand up for the unusual scientific process. He has spoken openly about his curiosity about the future fuelling his desire to be revived in the future. Alcor Life Extension is the world’s largest cryonics company, and according its CEO Max More, they’re signing up customers from all over the world who want their bodies preserved when they die. The big 'freeze' uses a solution much like antifreeze to preserve the body before being frozen and stored (stock image) 'The premise for cryopreservation is simple', Rose Eveleth told Science Alert. 'Cryopreservation can be thought of as the natural progression of this desire to keep someone alive using whatever means possible. Cryonics is the same thing, said Ms Eveleth, 'we just have to stop them from getting worse and let a more advanced technology in the future fix that problem.'

Alcor, an American company who sells the service says that they get clients from around the world (stock image) The icey price of freezing your brain is $80,000 and to preserve your whole body it will cost up to $200,000. Once an Alcor client has been officially declared dead, they begin the preservation process by moving body to an ice bed and cover them in a loose, slushy layer of ice. A device called a 'heart-lung resuscitator’ is used to get the blood pumping through the body again, and medication is applied to the body to prevent the cells from deteriorating. Next as much blood and bodily fluids are drained, then they are replaced with a solution like antifreeze.

Major blood vessels are then flushed of any blood then they are swabbed with the antifreeze solution. The antifreeze solution is used so that ice crystals do not form and damage any cells. The body is then cooled down to about 0.5 degrees celsius every hour until the final temperature of -195 degrees celciusis achieved over three weeks then the frozen body is stored.","Aussies are putting their hand up for a freeze treatment that may bring you back to life in the future .

"A leech has been found to be able to survive after being submerged in liquid nitrogen. Ozobranchus jantseanus, a parasite found inside freshwater turtles, can be successfully reanimated after exposure to an astonishing -196°C for 24 hours. It can also survive in temperatures of -90°C for nearly three years. The Ozobranchus jantseanus, a leech that can survive a day in -196C . The discovery was made by a team of Japanese scientists who found a still-living leech attached to a frozen turtle. Most organisms expire after freezing because of the damage caused by the water in their cells when it freezes. The team are now trying to unlock why the Ozobranchus jantseanus is able to survive something that is so devastating to other creatures. It could help unlock humanity's grasp of cryopreservation, where cells, whole tissues, or any other substances susceptible to damage caused by chemical reactivity or time are preserved by cooling to sub-zero temperatures. Suspended animation is the slowing of life processes by external means without killing the organism. Breathing, heartbeat, and other involuntary functions may still occur, but they can only be detected using electronic equipment. Extreme cold can be used to slow an individual's functions, a process known as cryonics. Cryopreservation freezes organisms using liquid nitrogen that will preserve it until reanimation. Two-celled embryos have been kept in suspended animation for as long as 13 years. Extreme temperature: A flower frozen in liquid nitrogen and smashed . 'Ozobranchid leeches have a mysterious mechanism to prevent freezing. I want to get to the heart of the matter,' researcher Takahiro Kikawada said, reported The Asahi Shimbun. The research, published in published in peer-reviewed science journal PLOS One, states: 'This finding is particularly interesting because the leech can survive these temperatures without any acclimation period or pretreatment. 'It is unlikely that O. jantseanus would encounter similar freeze-thaw cycles in its natural environment of so it is suggested that the cold tolerance observed in this species has not arisen in response to some ecological need or that it is an environmental adaptation. 'Rather, it is likely that this cryotolerant ability has arisen in response to some as yet unclarified adaptation.' Liquid nitrogen is nitrogen in a liquid state at an extremely low temperature. At atmospheric pressure, liquid nitrogen boils at −196°C and is a cryogenic fluid that can cause rapid freezing on contact with living tissue. When appropriately insulated from ambient heat, liquid nitrogen can be stored and transported, for example in vacuum flasks. Nitrogen was first liquefied at the Jagiellonian University on 15 April 1883 by Polish physicists, Zygmunt Wroblewski and Karol Olszewski.","The parasitic leech has been found to survive immersion in liquid nitrogen .

"The last surviving child of legendary Boston Red Sox great and Hall of Famer Ted Williams has spoken publicly for the first time about the controversial decision she and her brother took to have their father cryogenically frozen. Claudia Williams, the youngest of The Kid’s three children, together with her brother John-Henry were subjected to public ridicule in 2002 when they spent $100,000 to have the baseball legend’s remains sent to a cryonics lab in Arizona. Their decision also prompted an ugly legal battle with Williams’ oldest daughter, Bobby-Jo Ferrell,  who insisted that her father’s final wishes were to be cremated and his ashes scattered off the Florida Keys. Claudia Williams, the youngest of The Kid¿s three children, left, together with her brother John-Henry, right, were subjected to ridicule in 2002 when they spent $100,000 to have the remains of baseball legend Ted Williams sent to a cryonics lab in Arizona. This photo was taken months before his death in July 2002. Preserved: Alcor has been cryogenically freezing 'patients' since 1976, putting their bodies and heads in Thermos-like steel tubes. Both Ted Williams and his son John-Henry are stored there . At the time Bobby-Jo accused her half-siblings of wanting to preserve their father's DNA with the intention of selling it in the future. In her new book Ted Williams, My Father, Claudia says the decision to move her father's body to the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona was done out of love. ‘I can tell you that my family chose cryonics out of love,’ writes Claudia about the controversy. ‘Our father knew we needed something to hold onto for hope and comfort and when we missed him the most, and if cryonics was the answer, then the solution was simple.’ She writes that while she and her brother ‘didn’t truly believe at the time’ they sent their father’s body off to a cryonics lab that they would all ‘awake from suspension and be reunited’ they did it because they couldn’t bear the thought of losing him forever, reports the Boston Herald. Known as The Kid, Ted Williams, left, is considered the greatest hitter in US baseball history and his daughter's new book, right, recalls her recollections of their time together . ‘No one would spend over $100,000 and subject themselves to public outrage and ridicule for someone they don’t dearly love. There was no ill intent or devious plan. ... It (cryonics) was like a religion, something we could have faith in.’ ‘It is no different from holding the belief that you might be reunited with your loved ones in heaven,’ writes Claudia. Born after her father retired from baseball, Claudia grew up with little idea that her dad was one of the most revered sports figures of all time - until she finally saw him in uniform at Fenway Park, receiving the adulation of thousands of fans. Claudia and brother John-Henry were the children of Williams and his third wife, Dolores Wettach, a former Miss Vermont and a Vogue model. The couple divorced three years after Claudia was born and the children rarely saw their father until they were young adults. Ted Williams' oldest daughter, Bobby-Jo Ferrell, left, insisted that her father's final wishes were to be cremated and his ashes scattered off the Florida Keys and tried to stop her half-siblings from freezing her father's body . In her book, Claudia writes that both she and her brother constantly tried to win his attention and affection and she believed she had it worse because she wasn’t a boy. She also describes a bitter relationship with Bobby-Jo. Ted Williams was 83 when he passed away in July 2002.

"A pioneer of the cryonics movement which advocates freezing the dead in the hope that medical technology will enable them to live again in the future has died at the age of 92. Robert Ettinger, from Clinton Township, Detroit, became the 106th person to be stored at the Cryonics Institute which he founded in 1976. The World War Two veteran, who taught physics at Wayne State University, was seriously wounded during the Battle of the Bulge and spent years in hospitals. Legacy: Robert Ettinger, 92, has been frozen in the Cryonics Institute he founded after his death . High tech: The institute, in Detroit, Michigan, already has Mr Ettinger's mother and two wives as patients . Bone graft surgery that saved his legs inspired his optimism about the future prospects of preserving life through technology, a statement from the Cryonics Institute said. His son David Ettinger said he had been inspired by science fiction writings about deep-freezing the dead and expected researchers to make serious progress toward developing the idea. But when nothing seemed to be happening, he wrote a book in 1964 entitled 'The Prospect Of Immortality', introducing the concept of cryonics. He wrote: 'If civilisation endures, . medical science should eventually be able to repair almost any damage to . the human body, including freezing damage and senile debility or other . cause of death.' 'Sooner or later our friends of the future should be equal to the task of reviving and curing us,' said Ettinger . Optimist: Mr Ettinger was inspired by successful bone graft surgery he underwent after being injured during World War Two. Right, the 1964 book he wrote in which he introduced the idea of freezing humans after death . Cryonics is the low-temperature preservation of humans and animals with the hope that they will be able to be 'brought back to life' when science is able to do so. It is often confused with cryogenics, the study of the production of very low temperatures and how materials react to them. The procedure has to be begun within minutes of cardiac arrest. Cryoprotectants are used to prevent ice crystals forming between body cells, which would then cause irreparable damage if the victim was then 'thawed'. The belief is that memories and identity could survive the freezing process. Only around 200 people have been preserved cryonically since it was first proposed in 1962. Films featuring cryonics include Woody Allen's 1973 Sleeper, James Cameron's Aliens in 1986 and the 1992 movie Forever Young, starring Mel Gibson (pictured). He added: . 'No matter what kills us, whether old age or disease, and even if . freezing techniques are still crude when we die, sooner or later our . friends of the future should be equal to the task of reviving and curing . us.' Mr Ettinger promoted his theory in other writings and appearances on television talk shows. The Cryonics Institute has 900 members. Similar facilities for preserving dead bodies operate in Arizona, California and Russia. He also established the Immortalist Society, a research and education group devoted to cryonics and extending the human life span. The institute charged $28,000 to prepare a body and store it long-term in a tank of liquid nitrogen at minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit. The first person frozen there was Mr Ettinger's mother, Rhea Ettinger, who died in 1977. Both his wives, Elaine and Mae, are also patients at the institute. His son said he was never bothered by ridicule and was a 'reluctant prophet'. 'He did what he thought was necessary and appropriate and didn't worry much about what people thought,' he said. 'The people who are scoffers are like the people who said heavier-than-air flight won't work.' Robert Ettinger died at his home in Detroit after weeks of declining health.","Body of Robert Ettinger committed to his own institute .

"It might seem like common sense that it’s better to make important decisions after you’ve eaten. But a study has claimed the exact opposite - that we actually make better decisions on an empty stomach. Researchers found that people who were hungry made better snap decisions and could also appreciate future big rewards better than those who were fully fed. Researchers at Utrecht University in The Netherlands say people make better decisions when they are hungry, including in activities such as gambling (stock image shown). In studies they found participants could better appreciate short and long rewards on an empty stomach . The research was carried out by scientists at Utrecht University in The Netherlands. In the study participants were asked to fast for a night, and when they arrived at the laboratory the next day some were given food and some were not. They were then given a variety of tasks to simulate decision making. In two of the three tasks participants took a psychological test known as the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which is said to simulate real-life decision making. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a psychological test to simulate real-life decision making. It is widely used in research of cognition and emotion. In the IGT participants are presented with four virtual decks of cards on a computer screen. Depending on the card drawn, some will win game money, some will lose money and some also carry a penalty. Some of the decks are ‘bad decks’ and some are ‘good decks’, and it is down to the participant to work out which decks are best to selecting winning cards from. By testing a group of participants the test can be used to show how certain factors affect decision making. However, some critics of the IGT say it is not as accurate as thought. The first study involved 30 university students participating in the IGT in exchange for money, while the second was similar but involved 50 students. The results of these two studies indicated that people were better at making quick decisions while operating on an empty stomach . In the third study, which involved 46 students, the participants were presented with 27 questions requiring them to choose between being given a small amount of money in the present or a larger amount of money in the future. In this study, the participants who had not eaten were more likely to choose the latter option, and vice-versa for those who had eaten. Overall it was found that the participants who were  hungry made more advantageous decisions in the task than those who had eaten. Hungry people also had a better perception of future big rewards. This suggests that making decisions in a ‘hot state’ is actually beneficial. A 'hot state' is what psychologists call the moment when high levels of emotion can cause you to make quickly and sometimes irrational decisions. The results challenge the thought that being hungry leads to rash decisions. This is known as a 'hot state', when emotions influence actions. The researchers say not eating (stock image shown) may actually allow us to make better decisions. And they also say quick decisions may not be as bad as thought . ‘These studies for the first time provide evidence that hot states improve decision making under uncertain conditions, challenging the conventional conception of the detrimental role of impulsivity in decision making,’ the researchers write. They conclude that the pre-conceived notion that people make irrational decisions on an empty stomach is not necessarily true. ‘It may be that hot states in general, and hunger and appetite in particular, do not necessarily make people more impulsive but rather make them rely more on their gut feeling which benefits complex decisions with uncertain outcomes,' they add. ‘Alternatively, it may be that hot states do increase impulsivity but that impulsivity is not necessarily bad.’","Researchers at Utrecht University in The Netherlands say people make better decisions when they are hungry .

Although the robot wants to travel from one point in Canada to another, the route will depend on the drivers and could take it into the U.S. The droid has artificial intelligence (AI) systems that allow it to recognise speech and converse with people it finds on its journey. To keep them engaged in conversation, hitchBOT also runs social media and Wikipedia applications that help it make small talk. Equipped with GPS, 3G wireless connectivity, a camera, and a built-in child booster seat, the droid will be able to monitor its progress across Canada .

Equipped with GPS, 3G wireless connectivity, a camera, and a built-in child booster seat, the droid will also be able to monitor its progress across Canada. HitchBOT is the brainchild of Dr David Harris Smith of McMaster University and Dr Frauke Zeller of Ryerson University both in Ontario. 'Usually, we are concerned whether we can trust robots…but this project takes it the other way around and asks: can robots trust human beings?' said Dr Zeller. Using its charm and good looks, Hitchbot convinced people to drive him from Halifax, Nova Scotia (pictured right), to Victoria, British Columbia (pictured left). Although the robot wants to travel from one point in Canada to another, the route will depend on the drivers and could take it into the U.S. On July 27, hitchBOT - who stands about the height of an average six-year-old - will be let loose on the TransCanada highway. As well as thumbing down a ride, the bot will also ask that people plug it into the cigarette lighters in their cars to charge its battery . 'We expect hitchBOT to be charming and trustworthy enough in its conversation to secure rides through Canada.' Dr David Harris Smith envisions that hitchBOT will look 'like somebody has cobbled together odds and ends to make the robot, such as pool noodles, bucket, cake saver, garden gloves, wellies, and so forth.' On July 27, hitchBOT - who stands about the height of an average 6-year-old - will be let loose on the TransCanada highway.

"For years, Nicole Hulbig collected beloved pets and rescue dogs from all over the country and promised to train them to be therapy dogs for PTSD-stricken soldiers and disabled children. Her pledges turned to ash this week after authorities found 37 bags of badly-decomposed dead dogs in her barn near Clarksville, Tennessee, along with 39 canines that were barely alive - covered in their own filth, locked in a cages that were too small and deprived of food and water. The horrific discovery on Thursday follows animal control officers removing four rotting dead puppies locked in cages from another home she lived in. Hulbig, 29, has been arrested on 12 counts of animal cruelty and outraged dog owners are demanding she face even tougher penalties. Shocking: Nicole Hulbig, 29, has been charged with 12 counts of animal cruelty for the dogs found at home homes in Tennessee . Before and after: One owner who left her dog Max in Hulbig's care said he dropped from 90lbs (left) to 55lbs (right) since February . This is Max shortly after he was returned to owner Leah Patterson. Patterson says he is recovering after his horrific ordeal . The Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle reports that Hulbig ran RRR Service Dogs, which claimed to be a non-profit organization that rescued unwanted dogs and trained them to be service animals. Among the dogs that she took her were three dogs brought to the U.S. from Afghanistan by a California attorney and a German Sheppard owned by a disabled veteran. Their owners say Hulbig promised to retrain them and make them less aggressive. Now, the dogs are believed dead - among the countless dozens piled into bags and left to decay in her barn. 'I think they’re dead,' California lawyer Amy Konstantelos told the Leaf-Chronicle, speaking about the three dogs she had rescued from Afghanistan. 'I think they’re in one of those bags, and we’ll never know which one.' Hubig's husband, Eric Hubig, was also charged with animal cruelty for the four dead puppies found at a home he had rented with his wife . Hubig did provide proof that she had trained some dogs at her orgnaization. She posted this picture on her now-defunct Facebook page . Hulbig told authorities that the dogs died after a wave of distemper, a virulent canine virus, struck the kennels. Since authorities have no proof that the animal died from neglect or cruelty, she cannot be charged for any of their deaths. However, Hulbig and her husband Eric Hulbig can be charged for four dead puppies that were discovered in a former home. Authorities say they were locked in cages and left to die without food or water when the couple abandoned the home. Despite the tragedy, there is some good news. Some of the surviving dogs have been reunited with their owners who turned them over to Hulbig. One of those is Leah Patterson, who left Max in Hulbig's care in February after she promised to give him better training. She found him on Thursday among the surviving dogs that were seized from her barn. 'They bring him out, and I literally hit my knees crying,' he told the Leaf-Chronicle. 'I didn’t believe it was him. He was 89.6 pounds, and now he’s 55 pounds.

"Female cat owners are more likely to suffer mental health problems and commit suicide because they can be infected with a common parasite that can be caught from cat litter, according to a study. Women infected with the Toxoplasma gondii - or T. gondii - parasite, which is spread through contact with cat faeces or eating undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables, are at increased risk of suicidal thoughts. About a third of the world’s population . is infected with the parasite, which hides in cells in the brain and . muscles, often without producing symptoms. Risk? Female cat owners are more likely to commit suicide because they can be infected with a common parasite that can be caught from cat litter . The infection, which is called . toxoplasmosis, has been linked to mental illness, such as schizophrenia, . and changes in behaviour. Scientists from the U.S., Denmark, Germany and Sweden looked at more than 45,000 Danish women who gave birth between 1992 and 1995. Babies . don’t produce antibodies to T. gondii until three months after they are . born, so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in . the mothers. The scientists . scoured Danish health registries to determine if any of women . diagnosed as infected later attempted suicide, including cases of violent suicide attempts . which may have involved guns, sharp instruments and jumping from high . places. They found . that women infected with T. gondii were one-and-a-half times more likely . to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected, and the . risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the T. gondii antibodies. Lead researcher Dr Teodor Postolache, from the University of Maryland, said: 'We can’t say with certainty that T. gondii caused the women to try to kill themselves, but we did find a predictive association between the infection and suicide attempts later in life that warrants additional studies.' The study is the largest ever to try and ascertain a link between T. gondii and attempted suicide and the first prospective study to document . suicide attempts that occurred after the infection was discovered. Dr Postolache’s research team at the University of Maryland was the first . to report a connection between T. gondii and suicidal behaviour in 2009. The parasite thrives in the . intestines of cats and is spread through oocysts passed in their . faeces. All warm-blooded animals can become infected through ingestion . of these oocysts. The organism spreads to their brain and muscles, . hiding from the immune system within 'cysts' inside cells. Humans . can become infected by changing their infected cats’ litter boxes, . eating unwashed vegetables, drinking water from a contaminated source or, more commonly, by eating undercooked or raw meat that is infested . with cysts. Not washing . kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food . item also can lead to infection. Pregnant women can pass the parasite . directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter . boxes to avoid possible infection. Dr Postolache noted the study's limitations, such as the inability to determine the cause of suicidal behaviour. He added: 'T. gondii infection is likely not a random event and it is conceivable that the results could be alternatively explained by people with psychiatric disturbances having a higher risk of becoming T. gondii infected prior to contact with the health system.' The findings are published online in the Archives of General Psychiatry.","Women infected with Toxoplasma gondii are one-and-a-half times more likely to attempt suicide .

"It is widely accepted that people with a family history of schizophrenia are more susceptible to the mental health condition. But the theory that people can develop it after being infected with Toxoplasma gondi – a parasite transmitted by soil, undercooked meat and cat faeces, is controversial. Now, a new study suggests that one fifth of cases of schizophrenia may involve the parasite. A new study suggests that a fifth of cases of schizophrenia may involve the parasite Toxoplasma gondi, which is transmitted by soil, undercooked meat and cat faeces. A tissue smear containing the parasite is shown . Gary Smith, professor of population biology and epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Veterinary Medicine is behind the research. ‘Infection with Toxoplasma is very common, so, even if only a small percentage of people suffer adverse consequences, we could be talking about problems that affect thousands and thousands of people,’ he said. Just over one third of the US population is infected with T. gondii and the vast majority of people aren’t aware of it, according to the study published in the journal Preventive Veterinary Medicine. The parasite can be especially dangerous to certain groups of people. For example, if a woman becomes infected for the first time during pregnancy, her foetus can die or suffer serious developmental problems. The theory that Toxoplasma gondi causes schizophrenia (illustrated with stock image) isn't new, but now the health risk has been quantified . People with HIV or other diseases that weaken the immune system are susceptible to a complication of T. gondii infection called toxoplasmic encephalitis, which can be deadly. While it has long been believed that most healthy people suffer no adverse effects from a T. gondii infection, recent studies have found evidence of worrying impacts, including an association with schizophrenia, because the parasite is found in in the brain as well as in muscles. Some antipsychotic drugs can stop the parasite from reproducing, but studies in mice, rats and people have also shown that infection with T. gondii triggers changes in behaviour and personality. To investigate this connection, Professor Smith sought to calculate the population attributable fraction (Paf) which experts use to determine how important a risk factor might be. In this case, the Paf is ‘the proportion of schizophrenia diagnoses that would not occur in a population if T. gondii infections were not present,’ he explained. By taking into account the fact that the proportion of people that are infected with T. gondii increases with age, he worked out the average Paf during the average lifetime to be 21.4 per cent. ‘In other words, we ask, if you could stop infections with this parasite, how many cases could you prevent?” Professor Smith said. ‘Over a lifetime, we found that you could prevent one-fifth of all cases. That, to me, is significant.’ He noted that in some countries, the prevalence of T. gondii infection is much higher than in the US and these countries also have a higher incidence of schizophrenia. ‘By finding out how important a factor T. gondii infection is, this work might inform our attitude to researching the subject,’ Professor Smith said. ‘Instead of ridiculing the idea of a connection between T. gondii and schizophrenia because it seems so extraordinary, we can sit down and consider the evidence. Perhaps then we might be persuaded to look for more ways to reduce the number of people infected with Toxoplasma.’ ‘Infection with Toxoplasma is very common, so, even if only a small percentage of people suffer adverse consequences, we could be talking about problems that affect thousands and thousands of people.’ Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms, including: . Doctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness. This means sometimes a person may not be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality, according to NHS Choices. The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. However, most experts believe the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The theory that it is caused by Toxoplasma gondi is not new, but it is controversial.","The theory that people can develop schizophrenia after being infected by the parasite Toxoplasma gondi is not new, but it is controversial .

"Chronic infection with the parasite Toxoplasma can make mice lose their innate, hard-wired fear of cats, effectively turning them into zombies . Chronic infection with the parasite Toxoplasma can make mice lose their innate, hard-wired fear of cats, effectively turning them into zombies. The loss of their innate fear may persist after the parasite is no longer detectable in their brains, suggesting that initial infection may cause permanent changes in the rodents' brains. Infected mice lose their fear of cats, . which is good for both cats and the parasite, because the cat gets an . easy meal and the parasite gets into the cat's intestinal track, the . only place it can sexually reproduce and continue its cycle of . infection. A study by the University of California, Berkeley, found the mind-controlling parasite is even more powerful than was first thought. Wendy Ingram, a graduate student at the university tested mice by seeing whether they avoided cat urine, which is normal . behaviour, versus rabbit urine, to which mice don't react. While . earlier studies showed that mice lose their fear of cat urine for a few . weeks after infection, Ingram showed that the three most common strains . of Toxoplasma gondii make mice less fearful of cats for at least four . months. In the research, published in the journal PLOS ONE, even after infection with Toxoplasma gondii has . been removed from rodents' brains, they continue to behave as if . unafraid of the smell of cat urine, suggesting that the infection causes . long-term changes in the brain. Ms Ingram said: 'It is remarkable that even after the infection has been largely or completely cleared, a profound behavioral change persists. The loss of their innate fear in mice may persist after the parasite is no longer detectable in their brains, suggesting that initial infection may cause permanent changes in the rodents' brains, scientists from the University of California, Berkley said . Toxoplasma gondii is capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals . Up to a third of humans worldwide have been exposed to the infection . Mild flu-like symptoms occur within the first few weeks following exposure but produces no symptoms in healthy adults . In babies, HIV and AIDS patients and others with weakened immunity it can cause fatal toxoplasmosis . The infection can be transmitted by eating uncooked meat containing tissue cysts or through transmission from mother to fetus . The parasite reproduces only within the intestines of the cat family, which is defined as the host . A handful of studies have suggested subtle behavioural and personality changes can occur in infected humans (as well as mice) 'Simply having a transient infection resulting in what is potentially a permanent change in host biology may have huge implications for infectious disease medicine.' The Toxoplasma parasite, which has flu-like symptoms, can be deadly, causing spontaneous abortion in pregnant women or killing immune-compromised patients, but it has a zombie-like effect in mice. Ms Ingram speculates the parasite could directly alter neurons involved in memory and learning in mice, or it could trigger a damaging host response, as in many human autoimmune diseases. She became interested in the parasite after reading about its behaviour-altering effects in mice and possible effects in its common host - the cat - as well as humans. One-third of people around the world have been infected with Toxoplasma and probably have dormant cysts in their brains. Kept in check by the body's immune system, these cysts sometimes revive in immune-compromised people, leading to death, and some preliminary studies suggest that chronic infection may be linked to schizophrenia or suicidal behaviour. Infected mice lose their fear of cats, which is good for both cats and the parasite, because the cat gets an easy meal and the parasite gets into the cat's intestinal track, the only place it can sexually reproduce and continue its cycle of infection . Pregnant women are already warned to steer clear of cat litter, since the parasite is passed through cat faeces and can cause blindness or death in the fetus. One main source of spread is undercooked pork, Ms Ingram said. She is now looking at how the mouse immune system attacks the parasite to see whether the host's response to the infection is the culprit. Ms Ingram said: 'The idea that this parasite knows more about our brains than we do, and has the ability to exert desired change in complicated rodent behavior, is absolutely fascinating. 'Toxoplasma has done a phenomenal job of figuring out mammalian brains in order to enhance its transmission through a complicated life cycle.'","A University of California, Berkeley study found the three most common strains .

"Early man: The descendants of the first humans to leave Africa thousands of years ago shrank to little more than 1,000. The number of descendants of the first humans to leave Africa shrank to little more than 1,000 before expanding rapidly, a study has revealed. Scientists discovered the population of the ancestors of modern Asian and European people dwindled to just 1,200 who were 'actively reproducing'. They also found that African populations crashed to around 5,700 people. And, contrary to popular opinion, the study revealed that these early humans continued to breed with sub-Saharan Africans until as recently as 20,000 years ago. The findings were made by genome scientist Richard Durbin and his then research assistant Heng Li at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge. They mined the publicly available DNA sequence of American biologist Craig Venter - who was one of the first to sequence the human genome - as well as the sequences from six other people. By taking just a single person's genome, the pair were able to learn an entire population's history. Traditionally geneticists keen to look back at human history have compared DNA sequences from numerous people around the world to determine how different populations relate to one another and when they might have gone their separate ways. Discovery: Richard Durbin, left, mined the DNA sequence of American biologist Craig Venter, right, as part of a project which found that the first humans out of Africa shrunk to just 1,000 . But they have now found that part of a . person's genome - which stores hereditary information - can also be . followed back in time to when just one version, a common ancestor, existed. John Novembre, a population geneticist at the University of California, Los Angeles, explained the theory to Nature.com. 'Each little piece of the genome has its own unique bit of history and goes to a unique ancestor as you go further and further back. 'As you look at different parts of the genome, you get access to different parts of history.' Using this theory Mr Durbin and Mr Li were able to determine a way to calculate - from the ages of different segments of a single person's genome - changes in the population size of our ancestors. Most experts now believe that modern humans evolved in . Africa between 150,000 and 60,000 years ago and then migrated to the Near East, . Europe, Asia and eventually America . They looked at the genomes of Mr Venter . as well as those of two Europeans, two Asian men and two West African men. They all told the same story until about 100,000 years ago when their populations began to split and decrease in size. It is believed this reflected the first human migrations out of Africa. The two scientists were also able to compare the DNA from an African and a non-African to determine when their ancestors stopped interbreeding after the first humans left Africa. Previous research from human remains and artefacts found that humans colonized Europe, Asia and Australia about 40,000 years ago which prevented the opportunity to interbreed with Africans. But the new study by Mr Durbin and Mr Li has found that these groups may have continued to interbreed until as recently as 20,000 years ago. Mr Durbin said he believes this could be because after the first humans left Africa 60,000 years ago, they were followed by waves of Africans who interbred with the ancestors of the earlier migrants. Despite this, Chris Stringer, a palaeoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London, said that 20,000 to 50,000 years ago, human populations outside of Africa were probably small and widely dispersed, so regular interbreeding with Africans seemed unlikely. 'There could have been surges of gene flow at particular times, driven by innovations or environmental change, but it would be surprising if these continued right through that period,"" he says. The theory used by Mr Durbin and Mr Li cannot reveal every chapter of human history. But it is hoped that scientists will now be able to use the new approach to determine when Neanderthals and a mysterious sister population known as Denisovans stopped breeding with one another.","Study also reveals that early humans continued to breed with sub-Saharan Africans 20,000 years ago .

"Liverpool have offered Steven Gerrard a new deal as they try to end the uncertainty over his future. The 34-year-old, who could sign a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January 1, is considering his options and will base his decision on whether he believes he can contribute regularly next season. Brendan Rodgers has no doubt Gerrard will be a huge influence on the team and insisted money will have nothing to do with whatever decision the midfielder reaches. A smiling Brendan Rodgers arrives at Melwood on Monday ahead of Liverpool's trip to Leicester City (left) while Steven Gerrard was in relaxed mood while watching the Premier League action at home on Sunday (right) Reds captain Gerrard is driven to the club's Melwood HQ for training on Monday morning . Gerrard's advisors have met both Rodgers and chief executive Ian Ayre in the past month and Liverpool's manager insists he has earned the right to take his time. Rodgers said: 'Steven has been offered a contract. He deserves the utmost respect and deserves time to consider that. It is a big moment to consider what he is going to do at this stage in his life. There are many things he has to think about but it certainly won't be money.' Many believe Gerrard should be given a role at Anfield for life and Rodgers certainly sees him as someone who has the potential to become a coach in the future but, for the moment, he simply regards him as a vital member of his squad. 'He is still very much a player,' said Rodgers, who is expected to recall his captain at Leicester this evening. 'This is his concentration. When I see how he trains and works it is still about playing. Then maybe there is a role further down the line. To have someone like that beside you in a coaching capacity would be great. Gerrard was brought on as a late substitute in Liverpool's victory against Stoke on Saturday . Gerrard (left) helped the Reds grab a vital victory, which was secured by Glen Johnson's late goal . Gerrard posted this picture on his Instagram page to dismiss reports of a rift between him and his boss . ‘At this moment it is purely about football. He’s 35 at the end of this season and still has a couple of years to play if he wants. There are many things at this stage he needs to factor in.’ When asked if he and Gerrard had a problem, Rodgers said: '150 per cent no. There is no problem. We have a fantastic relationship.' He added: 'Listen, I love working with him. He is arguably the best player in the history of the Premier League. I saw some things yesterday that were unfortunate in terms of a rift between us. But one thing we have together is honesty and respect. 'It is not about the amount of games he will play now. It is the level of games he plays. No matter how good a player he has been, in the final few years you have to taper that. 'Everyone knows Steven's history here, what a player he has been. I need to focus that talent and utilise it in the games that he plays. He is a world-class talent. Rodgers and Gerrard have both moved to insist that there is no rift between the pair . Glen Johnson was hurt in scoring the winning goal against Stoke on Saturday - and by the lack of a new deal . Liverpool's players celebrate with the injured Johnson after he secured their first win in three league games . 'Steven, in terms of what he has done here, he deserves to concentrate on the team. It is just managing the period of his life that he is in. It reaches every player. It is not a problem. It is not an issue. 'All I can ever be is honest. That is how it will always be. He will be a key player here. I hope he will sign a contract.' Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini raised the prospect that he would be interested in signing Gerrard if he became a free agent and it is inevitable clubs in Europe, the Middle East and America, will be watching developments. Rodgers told Liverpool’s owners, Fenway Sports Group, why Gerrard should be awarded new terms and does not want to lose his services. When asked if he feared an approach from a Champions League club, Rodgers said: ‘I can only think about the situation here and I hope there is a solution with the club and his representatives. It is not about the money. It is about the time of his career in terms of playing. He is a big, big talent.’ VIDEO Gerrard denies Rodgers rift . After three straight Premier League defeats the result against Stoke was a much-needed boost for Rodgers. But the 41-year-old boss said his team's achievement had been overshadowed by talk of a bust-up between him and Gerrard. Asked whether the victory could be a turning-point in their season Rodgers said: 'Stoke had come to Anfield looking to get a result. We didn't get back home until 4.30am on Thursday (after the Champions League draw at Ludogorets). I have a huge amount of respect for the way that we kept the clean sheet. 'We have not had a great start to the season. But to get a win and see things written the day after of talk about a rift between the manager and the captain, it is very disappointing.'","Brendan Rodgers confirms Steven Gerrard has been offered a new deal .

"An enterprising blogger has transcribed, recorded, and uploaded a musical score she discovered discreetly written on the butt of a figure in Garden Of Earthly Delights, the famous painting by Hieronymus Bosch. The painting, which dates from between 1490 and 1510, is a religious-themed triptych - in three parts - which in its right-hand panel depicts hell. Amelia Hamrick, who attends Oklahoma Christian University, first learned about the painting in a humanities class last year, and fascinated by it had taken to looking at it from time to time. Scroll down to hear the music . The devil's tune: The poor, musically-branded soul can be found in the bottom left-hand corner of the painting¿s third and final panel, wherein Bosch depicts the various torture methods of hell . ‘It's kind of like a 500-year-old “Where's Waldo,'” she told The Oklahoman. After viewing the painting again with her friend Luke last Tuesday, they noticed that one of the suffers in the hell scene had musical notes branded on their backside and decided to find out what the butt song from hell might actually sounded like. Hamrick spent a half-hour transcribing it into modern notation, and then posted the recording on her blog where it began to get a lot of traffic; probably because of the unofficial name she gave the 27-second piece of music. ‘I feel like The 500-Year-Old Butt Song From Hell is a pretty funny name, but it's not the most academic,’ she said. ‘That's literally what it is, but in retrospect, I probably should have chosen a little more dignified of a name.’ The Garden Of Earthly Delights, the famous painting by Hieronymus Bosch, dates from between 1490 and 1510, and is a religious-themed triptych . The Garden of Earthly Delights is the modern title given to a triptych painted by the Early Netherlandish master Hieronymus Bosch. It has been housed in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1939. Dating from between 1490 and 1510, when Bosch was between about 40 and 60 years old, it is his best-known and most ambitious complete work. The three scenes of the inner triptych are probably intended to be read chronologically from left to right. The left panel depicts God presenting Eve to Adam, the central panel is a broad panorama of socially engaged nude figures, fantastical animals, oversized fruit and hybrid stone formations. The right panel is a hellscape and portrays the torments of damnation. Early Netherlandish master Hieronymus Bosch, left, and enterprising blogger Amelia Hamrick, right . The poor, musically-branded soul can be found in the bottom left-hand corner of the painting’s third and final panel, wherein Bosch depicts the various torture methods of hell. The unfortunate hell-dweller lies prostrate atop an open music book, crushed by a gigantic lute, while a toad-like demon stretches his tongue towards his tuneful buttocks. After unlocking one 500-year-old musical mystery, Hamrick has started looking for other pieces of hidden music in Bosch's paintings. Next she plans to transcribe the book with sheet music in it actually located in the same painting right next to the musical rear end.

"Voyager 1 appears to have at long last left our solar system and entered interstellar space… Or has it? The spacecraft, which carries Earthly greetings on a gold plated phonograph record, has travelled farther from Earth than any other human-made object. Its current mission, along with Voyager 2, is to explore the outermost edge of the sun's domain and beyond. Scroll down for video . A massive 36 years of scientific data generated by Nasa's Voyager spacecraft has been transformed into a powerful piece of orchestral music. Voyager 1's current mission (illustrated) along with Voyager 2, is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond . And now, Maryland and Boston University researchers say it has begun the first exploration of our galaxy beyond the sun's influence. But this contentious claim is at odds with a recent report from Nasa which claimed Voyager 1 was still exploring the final frontier of our solar system. ‘It's a somewhat controversial view, but we think Voyager has finally left the solar system, and is truly beginning its travels through the Milky Way,' said Maryland University research scientist Marc Swisdak. Mr Swisdak and fellow plasma physicists James Drake, also of the University of Maryland, and Merav Opher of Boston University have constructed a model of the outer edge of the heliosphere. This artist's concept shows NASA's two Voyager spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath, the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our sun . In the 36th year after their 1977 launches, the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft continue exploring where nothing from Earth has flown before. Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings -- the mission was extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The current mission for both spacecraft, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond. Their model indicates Voyager 1 actually entered interstellar space a little more than a year ago. But NASA and other scientists believe the spacecraft is still in a fuzzily-defined transition zone between the Sun's sphere of influence and the rest of the galaxy. The problem is scientists do not know exactly how far Voyager 1 has to go to reach interstellar space. In reality, there isn’t a clear boundary that defines the limits of our solar system 11 billion miles away. The sun’s pocket, also known as the heliosphere, is relatively well-understood as the region of space dominated by the magnetic field and charged particles emanating from our star. Outside the heliosphere, interstellar space is filled with matter from other stars and the magnetic field present in the nearby region of the Milky Way. Voyager is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward . The Voyager 1 spacecraft explored a new region in our solar system called the magnetic highway. In this region, the sun's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines, allowing particles from inside the heliosphere to zip away and particles from interstellar space to zoom in . According to conventional wisdom, scientists will know when Voyager has passed through this mysterious boundary when they stop seeing solar particles and start seeing galactic particles. They will also be a change in the prevailing direction of the local magnetic field. The problem is Nasa believes that the direction of magnetic fields in the solar bubble run in a different directional pattern to the fields found in interstellar space. The University of Maryland argues that the magnetic fields inside and outside of the solar bubble run in the same direction. They claim that because of this, there is an area where the solar bubble and interstellar space overlap, meaning the limits of our solar system are closer and that Voyager has already crossed it. Voyager 1 is capable of returning scientific data from a full range of instruments, with adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to keep operating until 2020. In a statement Nasa's Voyager project scientist, Ed Stone said: ‘The fine-scale magnetic connection model will become part of the discussion among scientists as they try to reconcile what may be happening on a fine scale with what happens on a larger scale. ‘The Voyager 1 spacecraft is exploring a region no spacecraft has ever been to before. We will continue to look for any further developments over the coming months and years as Voyager explores an uncharted frontier.’ Voyager 1 and Voyager  2, which were launched in 1977, are capable of returning scientific data from a range of instruments and have enough power to remain operational until 2020.

"The man sent to Brussels to spearhead David Cameron's plans to claw powers back from the EU has been dismissed as a 'charming' man with 'no grasp of the issues'. Lord Hill was nominated by the Prime Minister to be the UK's European Commissioner, at a crucial time for his hopes of renegotiating Britain's relationship with the EU. But after being selected for the financial services brief, doubts have been raised about the Tory peer's suitability for the job, as he told MEPs that he intends to serve European interests and not the City's in his new role of financial regulator. Vow: Conservative peer Lord Hill has promised MEPs that he intents to serve European interests and not the City's in his new role of financial regulator . Lord Hill was a surprise choice for the commissioner role in July, after previously ruling himself out because he wanted to stay in Britain. It was seen as a coup for the UK when new Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker handed him the financial services brief. Appearing at a confirmation hearing yesterday, he appeared to charm MEPs with jokes about the Queen but he left them short of details, and will be recalled for a second questioning session next week. Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts, who was among those to grill Lord Hill yesterday, dismissed him as 'charming but empty'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Lord Hill is a charming person but behind his charm there was apparently little knowledge of the subject matter at hand. 'It is not about knowing the intricate details of financial regulation, it was even the main lines that apparently Lord Hill had no grasp of.' He claimed that on a range of major issues including capital markets union, banks which are 'too big to fail' and Euro bonds, 'there was not a single idea put forward by Lord Hill that showed that he had a least some conceptions about these things'. He suggested that criticism of Lord Hill would be more intense were Britain's relationship with Brussels not already under strain. 'No one would claim that he had knowledge of the issues at hand. No I think that the main factor that played was that some people were hesitant to send a rebuke to the UK at times when the relationship between the UK and the European Union are quite tense. 'He may be a good commissioner, but I would probably not assign him this portfolio.' During the hearing, Lord Hill promised to put European laws before the interests of London, denying  accusations that as a former lobbyist he would be a stooge for Britain's  financial services industry. Addressing the European Parliament, he said he backed strong regulation of the industry, and vowed to enforce rules governing bankers' bonuses. 'I want Britain to be part of a successful European Union,' said Lord Hill, the former leader of Britain's House of Lords.  I want to work for the common European interest.' Appointment: Lord Hill's nomination in September was widely seen as an olive branch from Mr Juncker to an increasingly europhobic Mr Cameron . He is the first member of Jean-Claude Juncker's incoming European Commission team to be recalled since the parliamentary interviews started on Monday. The fate of Spain's energy and climate commissioner-designate Miguel Arias Canete was also in doubt after he faced a barrage of questions about alleged conflicts of interest and sexism. The European Parliament can ask Juncker to change members of his line-up - as it has done previously in 2004 and 2009 - and it must approve the entire commission in a vote on October 22. Lord Hill's nomination in September was widely seen as an olive branch from Mr Juncker to an increasingly europhobic Mr Cameron, who has promised a refrendum on Britain's EU membership in 2017. Decision: The European Parliament can ask Juncker to change members of his line-up - as it has done previously in 2004 and 2009 - and it must approve the entire commission in a vote on October 22 . But he insisted that he backed strong regulation, saying he was 'not here as a representative of the City of London'. He joked to MEPs about his poor command of foreign languages, and won applause by brushing off a question from a eurosceptic British lawmaker about his loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II. However, a European source later said that his answers 'lacked content' and that he would get a 'second chance' next Monday or Tuesday to explain the details of his policy on key financial issues. 'Hill does not get confirmation today. He will be invited to a new public exchange of views' with the economic affairs committee, Green euro-MP Sven Giegold wrote on Twitter. Controversial: The fate of Spain's energy and climate commissioner-designate Miguel Arias Canete was also in doubt . Mr Canete was repeatedly forced to deny accusations of a conflict of interest after having sold his shares in two oil firms shortly after his nomination to the energy job in September, while his son resigned from the board of one company. 'The very day I knew I was being appointed the commissioner, I ordered to sell the shares,' he . From the outset I have said I have no conflict of interest,' said Mr Canete, whose job is crucial at a time when the EU faces tensions with major gas supplier Russia. The bearded Spaniard also apologised for alleged sexism after making macho comments towards a female rival at a debate last year. 'It was indeed an unfortunate comment and I apologise once again to you,' he said. More than 300,000 people, including 76 EU parliamentarians, had signed a petition against his appointment. There was also a 'Stop Canete' protest by the Greens and the radical left outside parliament. Hungary's Tibor Navracsics, a former justice minister, faced a rough ride too on Wednesday, having repeatedly clashed with the EU over Hungarian Prime Minster Viktor Orban's crackdown on media regulation and the justice system. His nomination as Culture, Education, Youth and Citizenship commissioner was particuarly galling to critics given Orban's deep euroscepticsm - Orban and Britain's Cameron were the only national leaders to oppose Juncker's election in June. But Navracsics also sought to play up his pro-Brussels credentials, saying: 'I am proud of being a European and will be proud of being a European in the future.' The European Commission is the EU's executive branch, and will spearhead policy for the body for the next five years.","Former lobbyist denies he would be a stooge for Britain's financial industry .

Tragic: Friends Taylor Wheeler, 12, left, and Dayton Gessell, 15, right, were discovered minutes after gunshots rang out in the Daybreak suburb of South Jordan, Utah . 'This is a tragedy. The family's devastated. We really don't have any words to say. It's hard, very hard. These kids were so young with so much life ahead of them,' Shawn Graham, Dayton's uncle, told the Deseret News. An off duty policeman driving by the home discovered the Copper Mountain Middle School students' bodies at around 4:30 p.m. after another boy who was at the residence at the time ran onto the street and waved him down. The policeman then called South Jordan police who have been investigating the scene. Authorities have been unable to confirm where the guns came from, who owns them and even if they were used in the shooting. Mystery: Neither Taylor, pictured, or Dayton lived in the Daybreak home, and police say the investigation is ongoing . Guns: Authorities have been unable to confirm where the three guns found near the bodies of Dayton, left, and Taylor, right, came from, who owns them and even if they were used in the shooting . Scene: The boys were found dead in the basement of 4781 W. Pine Canyon Way, pictured in the Daybreak community of South Jordan, Utah. Neither boy lived at the home . Three boys - aged 16, 14, and 14 - who were in the house when the shots were fired were taken to the police station but not questioned, according to the Deseret News. All three were released to their parents. Police said they were confident were are no outstanding suspects. 'There should be no concern for the citizens that there's someone around with weapons or harm to their neighborhood,' South Jordan police Sgt. Sam Winkler said. The boys' family and friends held a vigil for them Sunday night and more than 100 people turned out to remember the students and support their loved ones. Dayton was described as an incredible young man who loved baseball and wanted to be an engineer.

Taylor's friend Drew Francom left a dollar bill on a picnic table for his pal. He said he was looking for change recently and asked Taylor, but at the moment the boy did not have money. Then later at lunch, Taylor found Drew again and gave him the dollar he needed. 'I never got to pay him back,' Francom said. 'So I brought him a dollar.' Graham said his nephew was clever and had an exciting future ahead of him. '(Dayton) was amazing with math. You could throw him a math problem and he didn't have to write it down. He could just hammer it out,' he said. Taylor's mother, Charlé Meier, told the Salt Lake Tribune the vigil was important because everyone who knew and loved her son and Dayton needed somewhere to be together and deal with the sudden loss. Crying, and holding her two daughters close, she said: 'We're lighting candles for lights extinguished too soon. They were just boys.'

"A mother died and her daughter injured when they were struck by a runaway van which rolled down a hill, a jury heard. Mohammed Karani had parked the Ford Transit Connect van on Swindon Road, Dewsbury while doing some electrical work at the Madina Academy. Stephen Wood, prosecuting, told Leeds Crown Court that CCTV footage showed him twice returning to the vehicle and removing tools. Mohammed Karani, 44, denies causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving . But around 34 minutes after he was last seen at the van it was captured moving backwards slowly down the incline, gradually increasing speed until it disappeared from view. At the same time, out of view below Simran Ahmed, 46, was crossing Willans Road with two children including her 10-year-old daughter Kiran. 'What then unfolded was seen by a number of witnesses and you may think must have been traumatic to view,' said Mr Wood. The van with no one inside picked up speed until it reached about 15mph, careering across the road and crushing Mrs Ahmed against a wall and seriously injuring Kiran. Mr Wood told the jury one witness seeing the van remembered thinking to himself 'brake, brake' as he saw what was happening but, of course, it did not. 'Witnesses at the scene immediately thought the worst,' said Mr Wood. 'Sadly they were right. Simran Ahmed sustained catastrophic internal injuries from which she could not recover. Her daughter suffered a fractured skull.' People rushed to help and one man pushed the van off the pavement where it had come to rest trapping the pedestrians, others gave first aid until the ambulance and paramedics arrived. No one entered the van which was locked. While the police were there Karani came down the hill and went to unlock it but was moved away and the keys were taken from him. The van was examined by investigator John Green and no mechanical defect was found. He noticed the gear stick was in neutral and the parking brake was only partially applied on two notches out of a possible six. Mohammed Karani parked his van here on Swindon Road, Dewsbury while doing some electrical work at the Madina Academy . The incline, the bottom of which was where Mrs Ahmed was walking when Karani's hit and killed her . Tests showed when on four it was easily able to hold its position on the hill. Mr Green concluded the brake was not applied fully, the vehicle was left in neutral rather than forward gear and, had the full steering wheel lock engaged, the wheels would have been at an angle that would have stopped the vehicle going backwards in a straight line. Mrs Ahmed died here (white wall) when she was hit by a Ford Transit van . Karani, 44, denies causing the death of Mrs Ahmed by careless or inconsiderate driving on April 26 last year. Mr Wood told the jury it was the crown's case it was still careless driving even if Karani was not behind the wheel at the time if it was 'careless in the way he left the vehicle'. He said that meant assessing how the notional competent and careful driver would have parked on a road with this degree of incline. 'When Mr Karani got out of the vehicle he must have appreciated just how steep this road was.' 'The standard of the competent and careful driver is set by the Highway Code,' Mr Wood added. Simran Ahmed, 46, was walking two of her children home from school when she was hit and killed by a van that rolled down the incline . Locals have placed flowers at the scene in Willans Road, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire where Shabana Ahmed was killed and her daughter seriously injured when they were hit by a Ford Transit Connect van . When Karani was interviewed he confirmed parking the van and said he was inside the college when someone shouted it was at the bottom of the hill. Asked if he left it in gear he said he did not remember, but usually did. Mr Wood told the jury it was the prosecution case he had not left the brake on fully, had left the gear in neutral and had not turned his wheel lock on fully. 'The inescapable conclusion is that had Mr Karani taken these precautions then this tragic collision would not have occurred,' Mr Wood added. He urged the jury to put aside any emotional response to the events. 'Such feelings are entirely understandable,' he said. 'It is entirely human and humane response to such a tragedy. 'But such feelings or emotions have no part to play in your deliberations over the guilt or innocence of Mr Karani.' The trial continues.

"Pictures have emerged of the  car crash which left David Beckham injured and shook up his son Brooklyn. The former England football captain had just picked up his eldest from Arsenal’s training ground on Saturday when the smash happened. Photos show the driver's side of his Audi RS6 badly damaged while the other car - believed to be a Mitsubishi Colt Coupe Cabriolet - was written off. Scroll down for video . Pictures have emerged of the aftermath of David Beckham's road accident on Saturday, which happened after the former footballer picked up his son, Brooklyn, from an Arsenal under-16s match north of London . The photos show the driver's side of the former England captain's Audi RS6 was badly dented in the collision . Beckham, 39, had been at Arsenal's training centre at London Colney, Hertfordshire  watching his eldest son play for the club’s under-16 side against Brighton. The ex-footballer was reportedly treated at the scene for minor injuries to his shoulder while Brooklyn was unhurt. A woman and her adult daughter in the other car were treated in hospital for minor injuries, The Sun reported today. A witness told the paper that Beckham was 'lucky to be alive' and gave his jumper to woman while they waited for help to arrive . Arsenal staff ushered onlookers away from the area and Beckham was driven away in another car. Both were said to be shaken following the accident. One Brighton youngster, Archie Davies, tweeted: ‘Just seen David Beckham looks like he got in a car crash and hurt his shoulder.’ The teenager then added: ‘Star struck by seeing David Beckham tbh.’ And team-mate Thomas Cadman  tweeted: ‘Weird to play against Brooklyn Beckham earlier. Even weirder to be currently stuck behind David Beckham as he has crashed his car.' David Beckham and Brooklyn (pictured together last year) both walked away from the accident. David had a minor injury to his shoulder and Brooklyn was unhurt . Beckham's Audi RS6 (pictured in June this year) was badly damaged in the accident and he and Brooklyn were driven home in another vehicle . Despite the accident and the reported shoulder injury he sustained, Beckham appeared alongside his wife Victoria at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards last night . Beckham's airbags are said to have been deployed in the smash. It's not the first time Beckham has been involved in an car accident - in October last year he collided with a car when pulling out of his driveway in Beverley Hills. He was then said to have been in his black Range Rover Sport with  his son Brooklyn, then aged 14, in the front passenger seat when the collision occurred on the afternoon of October 25. In that accident, damage was clearly visible on the white Acura 4x4, as well as David's expensive Range Rover Sport, where the bumper was hanging off the front. Brooklyn was signed by Arsenal on a short-term contract earlier this month after impressing coaches at The Emirates. Brooklyn’s brother Romeo, 12, has also been playing for the club’s under-13s, while youngest son Cruz, nine, has been representing the club’s under-10s.

"TV presenter Sarah Beeny says she has finally 'realised her dreams' by legally listing her controversial mansion as a wedding venue. Beeny and her husband Graham Swift said they have overcome a 'stressful' 12 months to open Rise Hall, near Hornsea, East Yorkshire, for bookings. They bought the former convent 10 years ago and were granted a wedding licence by East Riding Council in 2010, although couples were not allowed to get married 'over concerns for the health and safety of their registrars'. Here come the brides: Sarah Beeny infront of Rise Hall which has finally received the permission to be used as a wedding venue . Beeny’s run-ins with the authority over the property featured in her Channel 4 programme, Beeny’s Restoration Nightmare. The . couple bought the 33-bedroom property for £441,101 in 2001 and part of . the TV series showed a section of it being turned into a . wedding venue. However, Beeny had not yet applied for a planning application for weddings which angered her local Councillor. She has now put all the wrangles with the council behind her. The property developer said: 'Both Graham and I are so pleased that we are able to realise our dreams in bringing this beautiful house alive again and we look forward to sharing Rise Hall with future couples who are now able to get married here.' Lovingly restored: Rise Hall has already hosted weddings since Beeny moved in, but they did not have the permission to do so . Earlier in 2011 Humberside Fire and . Rescue Service restricted use of the first-floor bedrooms as there was . no 'protected means of escape'. Speaking last year Beeny said: 'Every . time we agree things, they say they want more things; I think our . frustration is that Rise Hall is a really important significant building . and everything has been done to a really high standard. 'They don’t have a problem with what we have done, their problem is that we didn’t talk to them enough about it.' Sweet dreams: One of the 33 bedrooms at Rise Hall with wood panelling . Restoration Nightmare: Beeny restored the house in front of a Channel 4 audience of millions . The presenter also had to submit a retrospective application to turn Rise Hall into a home, . because she did not apply for change of use permission when she started . living there. Beeny and her husband Graham Swift say the hall never had planning permission, and had been a family home in the past. But . local councillor Matthew Grove told the Hull Daily Mail: 'The ordinary . man in the street has to jump through hoops to get even the smallest . extension approved. 'Yet here we have a listed building being changed, with no planning permission in place, and without anyone batting an eyelid.' Beeny said they had spent £12,000 getting a certificate of lawful development to prove the former . school was being used as a private residence, even though the council . knew they had been living in it for 10 years. The Grade II- star listed building boasts 28 rooms sleeping 56 guests and has seven reception rooms. The venue will be managed by events specialists Dine. Daniel Gill, managing  director of Dine, said: 'Rise Hall is a beautiful country house, which has been painstakingly restored by Sarah and Graham to bring it back to its former glory. 'The team at Dine is really enjoying . working with the couple at this fairytale venue and we can’t wait to . make brides’ dream wedding come true.'

"Soaring numbers of under-40s are developing a type of diabetes linked to obesity and traditionally seen as a disease of the elderly. A study of GPs' records found the number of young people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes rose six-fold over two decades. The most common form of the disease, it is strongly linked to obesity and was once the preserve of the middle-aged and elderly. The number of people aged under 40 being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is soaring, a new study has revealed. In this file picture, a patient uses a lancet to test blood glucose levels . Those who analysed the figures said the increase can 'almost entirely' be explained by the obesity crisis – and warned developing diabetes early raises the odds of potentially deadly complications. Diabetics are more likely to suffer heart attacks and strokes than other people. The condition, in which the body struggles to convert sugar to energy, also increases the risk of blindness, kidney disease and nerve and circulatory damage, which can lead to amputations. Earlier onset gives the disease time to attack the body and could bring decades of ill health. The NHS already spends £10billion a year on diabetes – a tenth of its entire budget. The study of a snapshot of GPs' surgeries found that from 1991 to 1995, 577 people under 40 were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. But from 2006 to 2010, that soared to more than 14,000 – a more than 20-fold increase – with young women particularly likely to be diagnosed. A large part of this rise can be explained by changes in the way data is collected, and it is estimated the true rate of diagnosis in under-40s is now around six times higher than in the 1990s, at around 25,000 new cases a year. Obesity rates roughly doubled in the same period, with 26 per cent of adults dangerously overweight by 2010. Growing numbers of under-40s are developing type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity and traditionally seen as a disease of the elderly (file picture) In a report on their findings, published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, the researchers said: 'Not only was the overall  incidence increasing but the proportion of people aged 40 or less rose markedly. 'This is likely to place  an increasing burden on resources and may also lead to death at a younger age.' The researchers, from Cardiff University and the Heart of England NHS Trust in Birmingham, said the rise may be partly due to better screening, since GPs now have performance-related pay that rewards them for diagnosing sufferers. However, they said rising obesity was the main driver. Lead researcher Professor Craig Currie said: 'It's almost entirely obesity. How fat  you are is the top and bottom  of it.' Dr Matt Capehorn, of the National Obesity Forum, said even children in their early teens have been diagnosed. Some are genetically more at risk but lifestyle is the key trigger, he said, adding: 'It's still quite rare but we do see them. In the huge majority of cases type 2 diabetes develops as a consequence of being overweight. So as the weight of the nation increases, the incidence goes up too. 'The implications for NHS spending are huge. It already spends about 10 per cent of its entire budget on diabetes. It's not the diabetes that kills people but usually the heart disease they develop as a consequence.' Professor Jason Halford, of the UK Association for the Study of Obesity, warned diabetes is the first in a chain of diseases fuelled by obesity. He said: 'It is likely that in a few years we will see a similar epidemic of cardiovascular disease and, after that, probably an increase in a good number of cancers as well.'","Study of GPs' records found number diagnosed has soared .

"A teenage girl was allegedly groomed from the age of 12 and and taken to a drug den before being 'passed around for sex' by a gang of men. The girl fell pregnant at 14 during an 18-month ordeal which saw her raped and sexually assaulted by the men at a house in the Brierfield area of Burnley in Lancashire. Six men from the area have appeared before Manchester Crown Court to face a range of sexual offences against the girl. On trial Mohammed Zeeshan Amjad pictured outside Manchester Crown Court. He is one of six men on trial for a catalogue of alleged sexual offences against a 14-year-old girl . Not guilty plea: (From left to right) Mohammed Zeeshan Amjad, Mohammed Suleman Farooq, Omar Mazafer and Haroon Mahmood cover their faces as they appear at an earlier hearing in relation to the charges . Prosecutor Alaric Bassano told the court: 'The girl was groomed over a period of time and on many occasions was taken to a house near Brierfield, Burnley. 'That house was used as a den at which young men invited or brought young girls and women to drink alcohol, take drugs and engage in sex. 'It was to this house that this girl was taken and at this house that she was sexually assaulted and raped by several adult males. 'She was passed between the men to be used for their own sexual gratification. She was treated with indignity and contempt by them.' Mohammed Imran Amjad, 26, known as Immy , denies rape, child abduction and intimidating a witness. Shiraz Afzal,26, known as Frankie, denies aiding and abetting rape. Omar Mazafar ,22, known as Bats, denies inciting rape. Mohammed Suleman Farooq, 23, known as Sully, denies sexual assault, engaging in sexual activity with a child, and witness intimidation. Mohammed Zeeshan Amjad,25, known as Zishan, denies rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child and Haroon Mahmood, 22, denies rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child. Mr Bassano told the court that the victim became 'aggressive and disobedient' at the age of 12 and began spending a considerable amount of time with Immy Amjad. But when her worried mother confronted Immy, told him her child's age and accused him of an inappropriate relationship, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away. Mr Bassano said: 'The girl made no complaint and continued to fraternise with Immy. Immy himself was undeterred by the challenge and went on to commit numerous offences.' Leaving court: Mohammed Zeeshan Amjad (foreground with hood up in right hand picture with Omar Mazafer) denies inciting rape while Omar Mazafer (pictured leaving Manchester Crown Court yesterday, left) pleaded not guilty to rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child . The court heard that the girl later told police just before her 15th birthday when she was pregnant that she was first contacted by Immy when she was 12 years old. She was 13 when he began to drive her around Burnley and began to take her to the house where she was later raped and sexually assaulted by a number of men. Court hearing: Mohammed Zeeshan Amjad (left) and Omar Mazafer are pictured leaving a hearing at Burnley Crown Court earlier this month . One of the men had created a Facebook account with photographs of her and explicit captions. Mr Bassano said that the alleged victim did not reveal all the offences against her when first interviewed and the full allegations emerged after a further police investigation. The court heard that after her first interview with police, Immy Amjad had been questioned and later phoned her and threatened to kill her. Mr Farooq had also later stopped her in the nearby town of Nelson and threatened to beat her up and said he was going to acquire a gun to shoot her. A message found on her mobile phone read: 'Immy and Frankie have made me prostitute myself, made me sleep with their friends and said if I didn't want to, they threatened to hurt my Mum or sister.' Mr Bassano said that a witness would tell the court that she had seen the girl in the house on a number of occasions. She would recall Immy Amjed saying to Mr Afzal: 'I've had her, bro, you can have her.' The prosecutor added that text messages would show that Immy Amjad had considerable contact with the girl and often spoke about her 'in sexually degrading terms.' He said: 'They will also show that there were organised events in relation to drinking, drug taking and the procurement of females for sex.' The trial continues.

"A top cop in Chicago has been stripped of his badge and gun under accusations that he jammed his gun in a suspect's mouth during an interrogation. Commander Glenn Evans, who until Wednesday headed the Harrison District in the city's West Side, is charged with official misconduct and aggravated battery, both felonies. He's expected in court on Thursday. The complaint says Evans threatened to kill Rickey Williams, 24, after a chase in Chicago's infamous South Side back in January 2013, WBEZ reported. Evans, then a commander in the Grand Crossing district, chased the man with his officers after they spotted him with a gun. The cops eventually restrained Williams in a vacant home but never found the gun, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Commander Glenn Evans (right) was relieved of his post with the Chicago PD on accusations that he jammed the barrel of his gun in a suspect's mouth. The man, Rickey Williams (left), was arrested in the city's South Side . An analysis later showed DNA from the suspect matched samples from the commander's weapon. Evans is praised by his bosses as a tough-as-nails, no-nonsense cop who often joins his officers in patrols. He was promoted to commander in 2012. Among his officers, he's popular for his aggressive policing, according to the Sun-Times. But Evans has had dozens of citizens complaints filed against him, although only two resulted in formal discipline, the paper reported. Yet Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who heads the Chicago PD and promoted Evans to commander, remains on his side. Even as late as Monday, McCarthy gave reporters a staunch defense of McCarthy. 'Do I support him? If I didn’t support him, he wouldn’t be there,' McCarthy said when asked about a recommendation by the Independent Police Review Authority that Evans be let go, the Chicago Tribune reported. 'I'm not going to answer that question,' he told the reporter who asked him. 'That’s absurd.' In a statement after the charges were filed, McCarthy said, 'The alleged actions, if true, are unacceptable to the both the residents we serve and to the men and women of this department.'","Commander Glenn Evans, who headed a district in Chicago's West Side, is charged with official misconduct and aggravated battery .

"Tony Blair – the Middle East Peace Envoy – threw a lavish birthday party for his wife on Friday night at their country bolthole in Buckinghamshire, while the grim death toll from the Gaza conflict passed the 1,050 mark. Mr Blair, whose role is to hammer out a ceasefire in times of conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, spent most of last week in the UK before hosting the couple’s friends at the party, estimated to have cost about £50,000. He held the surprise 60th birthday party for Cherie at their £6million country mansion South Pavilions, formerly the home of Sir John Gielgud, inviting 150 of their closest friends, which included former New Labour ministers, as well as wealthy businessmen and TV celebrities. Scroll down for video . In the marquee: Tony Blair is flanked by guests Michael Pennisi and Sarina Russo at Friday's party. The snap, later posted on Instagram, was taken as the grim death toll from the Gaza conflict passed the 1,000 mark . Just to make Cherie’s night even more memorable, Mr Blair even hired glamorous dance couple Kristina Rihanoff and Ian Waite from BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing, who danced for them after dinner, to the Stevie Wonder classic Ma Cherie Amour. And comedian Bobby Davro was also hired to entertain, doing an impersonation of Mr Blair, and singing the song, If I Ruled The World. Mr Blair’s unexpected birthday party – held against a backdrop of death and destruction in Gaza – was criticised last night, with some saying he could have held it later, as Cherie’s actual birthday is not until September 23. One source said: ‘He should be in the Middle East, not in the UK.’ Lavish: The birthday party for Cherie Blair, estimated to have cost about £50,000, was held at the couple's country bolthole in Buckinghamshire. Above, South Pavillions, the Blairs' Home Counties retreat . Security: Guests are checked in by armed police officers, with many whisked home in chauffeured cars in the early hours of the morning . Last week Mr Blair, 61, gave a talk on New Labour on Monday at the think-tank Progress in Westminster. He even managed a one-day visit to China during the week, and made it back to the UK in time for his wife’s celebrations. However, other world leaders, such as US Secretary of State John Kerry and the UN’s Ban Ki Moon, flew into Jerusalem to pressure the Israelis and Palestinians to agree to a long-term ceasefire. Mr Blair is normally based in Jerusalem, as his Office of the Peace Envoy for the Quartet – the US, EU, Russia and the United Nations – is at the King David Hotel in the city. World leaders, led by Mr Kerry, held urgent talks in Paris yesterday to pressure both sides to turn the ceasefire into an extended truce. Mr Blair was not at the talks. Big fan: Cherie is pictured dancing with Strictly's Anton du Beke at an earlier event. He was not at Friday's party . The former . Prime Minister hosted Friday’s birthday bash inside a giant marquee . erected in the grounds of the couple’s sprawling estate. Some . of the guests from the world of politics included Labour leader Ed . Miliband and his wife Justine Thornton and Blair’s old No10 spin doctor . Alastair Campbell and his girlfriend Fiona Millar. The former Labour Europe . Minister and now chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, Keith Vaz and . his lawyer wife, Maria Fernandes, also attended.

Just to make Cherie's night even more memorable, Mr Blair even hired glamorous dance couple Kristina Rihanoff (left) and Ian Waite from Strictly, while comedian Bobby Davro (right) was also hired to entertain . Some guests posted pictures from the event afterwards on social media sites. They . included entrepreneur Sarina Russo  – director of a recruitment agency . of which the Blairs’ eldest son, Euan, 30, is acting CEO – who posted a . picture on Instagram of  her and a friend, Michael Pennisi, flanking Mr . Blair inside the marquee. Kristina Rihanoff tweeted a picture of herself . at the bash, while another guest, Kieran Patel, from Nottingham, posted . a picture of himself with Miss Rihanoff and Mr Waite before their . performance. And Davro tweeted after the event: ‘Wonderful gig at Tony and Cherie Blairs [sic] crib in Aylesbury.’ The . guests sat down to a three-course meal, with foie gras or hand-dived . scallops for starters, rack of English lamb and a ‘British strawberry . celebration’ dessert. Diners washed it all down with champagne, . Chardonnay and red wine. Cocktails were also served all night. Waiting in the wings: Guest Kieran Patel with Kristina Rihanoff and Ian Waite as they prepared to perform . Mr Blair gave a ‘schmaltzy’ speech to his wife, before the dinner started. Guests who attended said he told  the gathering how much he loved his wife, adding that everything good that he has done in life was because of her, and all the mistakes he had made were in spite of her. After the dinner, Cherie – a big fan of Strictly – was treated to a performance by Miss Rihanoff and dance partner Mr Waite, performing to Ma Cherie Amour. Bobby Davro then impersonated a blushing Mr Blair, and sang If I Ruled The World, from the musical Pickwick. At 11.45pm, the guests sang Happy Birthday to Cherie, as waiters brought a pink-coloured cake into the marquee. One guest, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It was a really good party and so well organised. Blair made a good speech.’ But he went on: ‘Although he should have been in the Middle East. But you sometimes think, what exactly has he done in the Middle East?’ Conflict: The lavish party was held as the grim death toll from the Gaza conflict passed the 1,000 mark . Destroyed: A Palestinian woman weeps as she walks amid destroyed buildings in Beit Hanoun town, which witnesses said was heavily hit by Israeli shelling and air strikes during an Israeli offensive yesterday . Mr Blair also laid on a disco and a spoof casino for guests, who danced until 1am, before leaving, some in chauffeur-driven Bentleys and Mercedes. Guests had been checked in by armed police officers from Thames Valley Police. The estate was also patrolled by about five armed police. The Blair household did not disclose how much had been spent on the party but Miss Rihanoff and Mr Waite charge up to £10,000 for one night’s event, and Mr Davro charges up to £4,000. Total costs are estimated at around £50,000. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘Tony was in China for one day during which he was constantly in touch on the crisis. He also spent ten days in the Middle East earlier and will return as soon as needed. However, as you know, John Kerry is leading the process of negotiation in Paris.’ By Peter Henn . The death toll in Gaza passed 1,000 last night as the Israeli defence minister warned that he may ‘significantly’ expand the ground offensive. The grim milestone was reached despite a 12-hour ceasefire yesterday, as bodies were recovered from inaccessible areas. More than 6,000 Palestinians have also been wounded in the 19 days since Israel launched the attack on the Hamas-ruled territory in an operation aimed at halting Palestinian rocket fire and destroying cross-border tunnels. Devastating: The death toll in Gaza passed 1,000 last night as the Israeli defence minister warned that he may 'significantly' expand the ground offensive. ABove, An air strike opn Gaza before yesterday's ceasefire began . The Israelis are believed to have found 50 tunnels so far. Gaza militants have fired close to 2,500 rockets at Israel since July 8 when the offensive began.Israel, which has lost 40 soldiers and two civilians in the conflict, agreed to extend the ceasefire last night by four hours, according to a government source, but Hamas last night refused the offer to prolong the truce. There were also reports that Hamas fired mortars at Israel immediately after the 12-hour truce ended. Late last night the Israeli army also reported that rockets were being fired over from Gaza. Grieving: A weeping Palestinian man is pictured mourning the death of a young relative in Gaza city on Friday . A high-level mediation mission led by US Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has so far failed in its attempt to broker a week-long ceasefire. Warning of an escalation of Israeli’s offensive, Israeli defence minister Moshe Yaalon said: ‘At the end of the operation, Hamas will have to think very hard if it is worth it to taunt us in the future.’ Hamas is demanding reassurance its border blockade will be lifted. Concern: Labour leader Ed Miliband said the civilian death toll in Gaza could not be justified . The ceasefire revealed the full extent of the destruction wrought by the Israeli offensive for those able to return to their neighbourhoods. After the temporary truce took effect, the streets of Gaza quickly filled with residents trying to stock up on supplies or inspect their homes. In the southern town of Khan Younis, relatives mourned the death of 20 members of an extended family, including ten children, killed by tank fire. At a hospital in the badly hit Beit Hanoun area, six patients spent a terrifying night on Friday huddled in the X-ray department as the building  was shelled. Yesterday, the remaining patients were evacuated, including 85-year-old Nasra Naim. Her daughter, Naame, said her own home had been destroyed. ‘I don’t know where to go,’ she said. ‘They [Israelis] killed our children, they took our land and now they are still following us.’ The Israeli military said troops would respond to any violations of the ceasefire and continue ‘operational activities to locate and neutralise tunnels in the Gaza Strip’. Meanwhile, after meeting with US Secretary of State John Kerry and foreign ministers from other EU nations, Turkey and Qatar, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘There is an absolute humanitarian necessity to see the 12-hour ceasefire currently taking place in Gaza extended.’ And Labour leader Ed Miliband said the civilian death toll in Gaza could not be justified.","Peace envoy Tony Blair's role is to hammer out ceasefire in times of conflict .

"Under fire: Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, wants to build another pool at his mansion in the Cotswolds . The millionaire boss of British Gas has been dubbed 'Sammy Two Pools' after splashing out on a second pool in the grounds of his mansion. Sam Laidlaw, who was paid £5 million last year, uses twice the amount of energy to heat his pool than the average family spends heating their homes. His plans have been revealed just two days after British Gas announced price increases of 10.4 per cent for electricity and 8.4 per cent for gas. Customer duel-fuel bills will rise from £1,321 to £1,444 a year. But that may not unduly worry 57-year-old Mr Laidlaw, chief executive of British Gas parent company Centrica, who already has a 52ft pool at his sprawling estate in the Cotswolds. Specialists estimate that to heat the 17,600 gallons held in the pool would require almost double the energy used in  a year by a British home. Now he wants to add a 46ft pool and has applied for permission from his local council. Heating both would cost £4,500 a year. Kim Catchpole, of Gravesend, Kent, told the Sun : How can Sammy Two Pools have any idea how hard it is when he wastes double what I spend.' Wealthy: An aerial view of Sam Laidlaw's home where the first pool is highlighted and the proposed site of the second pool . And Saga's Paul Green joked: 'Maybe he will be generous enough to open up one of them for pensioners to have a dip when they get a little chilly. Mr Laidlaw, an old Etonian, was among five directors who were paid a total pot in 2012 of £16.439 million. Energy prices have already risen by 24 per cent over the last four years, according to regulator Ofgem, ramping up the pressure on household finances at a time of wage stagnation. The paper reported British Gas chairman Sir Roger Carr, 66, has a pool underground at his £10 million home in Kensington, west London. Energy bill increases: British Gas announced price rises  of 10.4 per cent for electricity and 8.4 per cent for gas . In the past few days British Gas's Twitter feed has been filled with iangry customers slamming the company for the price rises, . One user tweeted: ""Do the @BritishGas board prefer to bathe in £20 or £50 notes? #AskBG""Another said: ""I have been concerned for some time now that your chief executive Sam Laidlaw only took home £5million last year. 'Could I set up a large direct debit to him personally? Alternatively, I do have a son. Could I give him to Sam?' Other tweets included: 'How do you feel knowing even Mr Scrooge will struggle to afford the gas to cook the turkey for the Cratchit family this Christmas?? #AskBG"" and ""BritishGas #AskBG What is the best temperature to thaw an elderly relative at and what seasoning would you use with one?'","Sam Laidlaw uses twice the amount of energy heating his pool than the average family spends on their home .

"It’s tricky to uphold Royal traditions when you’re not quite one – but Prince George has proved himself more than equal to the nation’s favourite: the walkabout. Invented by the Queen on an overseas tour in 1970 to ensure she was seen by her fans, it’s been an essential part of the Royal repertoire ever since. And now, in a portrait released to mark his first birthday on Tuesday, the third in line to the throne has shown he’s learned an early lesson from his great grandmother. Scroll down for video . Easy does it: George puts his best foot forward and shows why he's ready to continue a key Royal tradition . Like her, he’s delighting his audience with a trademark outfit, sensible shoes and a twinkle in his eye. But what’s all his own work is the newly-mastered art of walking – this is the first time we have seen George standing on his own two feet. The delightful shot was captured on a family outing to the Natural History Museum’s Sensational Butterflies Exhibition in London. The Duchess of Cambridge, who became a patron of the museum last year, took her husband and son to see it earlier this month. And he's following in the footsteps of Daddy... and Uncle Harry. William is pictured left on his first birthday in June 1983 and a young Harry steps out in style, right, as his brother watches on behind him . Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge show baby George the  world standing on the steps outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London on July 23 last year . Press . Association Royal photographer John Stillwell was there to record the . day and his lens found George practising his walking unaided. The . last time the Prince was seen in public, at a Father’s Day polo match . in June, he still needed his mother’s hand to help him keep his balance. But here, to his obvious delight, he has reached another significant milestone. Although . some babies walk as early as nine months, others can be twice that age, . making George’s achievement at around ten months remarkable. Dressed to impress: Held by her proud mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, George is pictured following his Christening at Chapel Royal in St James's Palace in central London . Flying high: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with Prince George arrive at Wellington Airport in New Zealand at the start their Royal tour of the country . Baby textbooks characterise early . walkers as busy, curious, impetuous and therefore occasionally . accident-prone, a description which chimes with the vignettes of family . life Kate and William have shared while on walkabouts of their own. The Duke revealed at a recent engagement that George is tearing around Kensington Palace opening and closing doors and exploring every corner of their home in Apartment 1A. He also recently predicted that George will be ‘running faster than me soon’ and admitted his son is hard to handle at bath time. Play time: George plays during a nurse and parents group session at Government House in Wellington, New Zealand in April . The Duchess of Cambridge holds George as he meets a Bilby - also called George - at Taronga Zoo, Sydney, Australia in April . Fit for a prince: George enjoyed a walkabout - with a helping hand from his mother - in Cirencester in June where Prince William and Prince Harry were playing in a polo match. He is pictured right as the family prepare to leave Australia following their overseas tour . Although the Duke and Duchess have been at pains to maintain George’s privacy since he was born on July 22 last year, they are acknowledging the intense global interest in their son’s first year by releasing three pictures of him. This is the first, issued yesterday by Kensington Palace. He is seen wearing his signature dungarees (this pair is by cult French yummy mummy label Petit Bateau), a smart navy polo shirt and navy blue Alex cruiser shoes designed to protect infant feet. George's look is one that you can recreate for just over £75. His striped dungarees from Petit Bateau can be found online for £27.65. The French brand also offers a navy blue towelling T-shirt for £20.40. And to complete the outfit, George is wearing his much-loved navy Alex Pre-Walkers – available from Trotters at £27.99. It’s clear George has grown significantly since we last saw him officially on the Cambridges’ successful tour of Australia and New Zealand in April. Then he was constantly in his parents’ arms. In contrast, the image on the right is one of joyful independence. George enjoyed an early birthday celebration at the Berkshire home of his grandparents, Michael and Carole Middleton who, with the help of his Auntie Pippa, organised a Peter Rabbit-themed party with guests including Mia Tindall, Zara and Mike Tindall’s baby girl. But his main party will be a low-key affair at Kensington Palace on Tuesday with only his closest family – including the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall – and friends in attendance. One palace insider revealed: ‘This is a couple who do things quietly and below the radar. Kate is organising the special tea party and she will be the one baking the cake.’","Prince George following the family tradition by enjoying a Royal 'walkabout'

"Matthew Macklin was sore, obviously heartbroken, but gracious in defeat. A thunderous right hook from Jorge Sebastien Heiland of Argentina had knocked him out in the 10th round of their WBC world middleweight title eliminator at the 3 Arena on Saturday night. He is now left with the unappealing and likely decision to retire without winning a world title. A student of boxing, he pointed out fighters who had numerous title shots before reaching the summit but also name-checked legends of the sport who fought because they were fighters. He deserves access to that club. ‘Look at the [Jake] LaMottas and all them — they lost many, many times and still went on and won a world title,’ said Macklin in his dressing-room after the fight. ‘How many footballers have bad games? It’s just in boxing you’re as good as your last fight. Matthew Macklin could be nearing retirement after suffering a devastating defeat in Dublin . ‘It’s a shame because now the world title looks further away and maybe it’s just not to be for me. Maybe that fight in Germany will haunt me forever.’ That fight in Germany was a reference to his 2011 points loss to Felix Sturm in Cologne in a WBA world-title fight. He was awarded the decision by German TV pundits that night, but the judges, bafflingly, awarded the win to Sturm. In hindsight, it was his best opportunity to win a world title, despite the fact that he went on to headline at Madison Square Garden against Sergio Martinez and later challenged pound-for-pound monster Gennady Golovkin. Now it seems likely that this could be the end for the two-time European champion after his sixth career loss brings his record to 31-6. Macklin was stopped by Jorge Sebastien Heiland in the 10th round of their WBC world title eliminator . Heiland and Macklin went toe to toe for 10 rounds. After a clean left hand landed on Macklin’s chin, that right hook from Heiland left the home fighter on the canvas 42 seconds into the round. In truth, the Birmingham-born Tipperary man looked every inch of his 32 years from the third round on and the aggregate damage of a pro career which started in his teens made him look, for the first time, a very tired fighter. ‘He was decent and I knew he was good,’ said Macklin of Heiland afterwards. ‘No one wants to admit they’re getting older but the pace of the fight… it probably suited him more than me.’ A constantly busy 27-year-old Heiland was too much to deal with. Argentine Heiland celebrates victory over Macklin in Dublin on Saturday night . ‘I’ve got the sort of face where I show every emotion anyway, so I looked tired after a round!” laughed Macklin afterwards, but the 32-year-old is now, undoubtedly, considering retirement. ‘I’ve had tough fights, tough spars and lived in f***ing hotel rooms all over the world! It’s a tough-ish life, but I’ve had more highs than lows, definitely.... I’ll just have to see.’ The unusual predicament Macklin finds will finds himself in is whether to fight on considering there is a possibility that he could yet book an All-Ireland showdown with Limerick’s Lee or a date with England’s Martin Murray. Promoter Eddie Hearn pinpointed Dublin middleweight Luke Keeler as a star in the making after the 27-year-old demolished Gary Boulden in one round, while he hinted that Cork’s Gary ‘Spike’ O’Sullivan could yet become a major player in the 160lb division after he battered Anthony Fitzgerald inside two minutes. Former amateur stars John Joe Nevin and Tommy McCarthy both recorded early stoppage wins.","Matthew Macklin knocked out by Jorge Sebastian Heiland in the 10th round .

"The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin serves as a solemn reminder of the millions of lives lost during the Holocaust. It also serves as the backdrop for hundreds of gay and bisexual men using the austere grey concrete backdrop as a location to shoot their profile pictures for social app Grindr. The images have been collected on the blog ‘Totem and Taboo: Grindr Remembers the Holocaust,’ and have caused considerable outrage over the political correctness of the location. Flex: Gay and bisexual men in Berlin have taken to posting pictures of themselves at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, sometimes without shirts and flexing their muscles . Looking for love: The man on the right wrote: 'I'm live Pavarotti under this shirt. Gym buddy anyone?' The memorial consists of 2,711 concrete slabs, encased on four acres of land in the heart of Berlin, and is a popular, if not sombre, tourist attraction for hundreds of thousands of people. Included in that are men on Grindr trying to find casual hook-ups and make connections. Men from the site are pictured in various poses – and sometimes shirtless – amid the grey concrete slabs. One blogger pictured making a steely glance for the camera wrote on his profile: ‘Remembering those who cannot text anymore.’ The blog, which was founded by Zion Afuta and Boris Cukierman, spells out its charter by saying that we live in an age ‘when ignorance is (sic) prevalent than ever,’ and Grindr has ‘wowed its members in relentlessly promoting the memory of the Holocaust.’ The Israeli-born blog founders live abroad; Mr Afuta in Berlin and Mr Cukierman in London, and told AbbaNibi that this unlikely tourist attraction became a backdrop for a specific sect of counterculture. They explained: ‘Users seem to come from various places and from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Through the adoption of Grindr users, the monument gets in our blog a new role; not only as a space for grief and sadness, but also a site for hope, unity, and cruising.’ Neither Grindr nor 'Totem and Taboo's' founders immediately responded to MailOnline's request for comment. On the prowl: Many Grindr users took the opportunity to model their steely poses . Glamor shot: Many of the images look like they could be from magazine editorials . Grindr founder and CEO Joel Simkhai told . Israeli entertainment site AbbaNibi in 2011 that he’s not in the least bit . offended. ‘As a Jew and an Israeli, I’m deeply moved by how users are . coming together as a community on Grindr to share and inspire others to . take part in memory of the Holocaust,’ he said at the time. But according to Salon, Grindr’s press representatives said the following on Wednesday: ‘What started as users expressing themselves on a topic not often discussed in social networking profiles, has now become disrespectful. ‘We strongly encourage our users to engage in a respectful manner and honor the memory of those who perished in outher ways outside of the app.’ ‘While the gay community is being under scrutiny for promoting hedonism and alienation, this tribute seems all the more compelling.’ Never again: Flowers lay on a slab of the Holocaust Memorial to commemorate the victims of the Nazi regime at the International Holocaust Rememberance Day on Sunday the 27th .

Another wrote: ‘While I am saddened that people use the denkmal as a place to have fun, it isn’t surprising, and it isn’t going to stop.’ But there were others who did not seem so offended by the photos. ‘He’s not going to flex his pecs at Auschwitz or at a cancer ward,’ one commenter wrote on Heeb’s website.

The IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight champion floored his opponent twice in the opening round and it looked like it could be a brief encounter in the opening stages. Pulev was on the floor again in the third but once again got to his feet before a huge left hook from Klitschko in the fifth handed the Bulgarian his first defeat in 21 fights and Klitschko extended his record to 63-3 with the 53rd knockout of his career.

"House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was dramatically defeated Tuesday in a Virginia GOP primary,  crushed at the hands of a little-known economics professor – a stunning upset and the highest-profile scalp on the Tea Party's growing trophy wall. The seven-term congressman lost by a 55-44 margin to Dave Brat, a political novice with little money, marking a huge victory for the same conservative insurgent movement that supported Cantor just a few years ago. 'I know there’s a lot of long faces here tonight,' Cantor told supporters after conceding the race to Brat. 'It’s disappointing, . sure.' 'Obviously, we came up short.' Cantor is the second-most powerful member of the U.S. House and was touted as a likely successor to House Speaker John Boehner. He is the first House Majority leader in American history to lose his party's primary. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dave Brat, right, defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary on Tuesday, marking one of the most improbable American political victories in the history of party primaries . Stick a fork in him: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor leaves the stage with wife Diana after his concession speech on Tuesday following his crushing defeat at the hands of an unknown tea party-backed professor . Don't Tread On Me: Tea party pick Dave Brat celebrates in front of hundreds of supporters after snatching the Republican nomination for congress away from Cantor in a stunning upset that no one in the pundit class saw coming . In . 2004, South Dakota Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle lost re-election to a . Republican while he was the sitting Senate Majority Leader. But that . loss didn't come at the hands of a fellow Democrat. Virginia law prohibits Cantor from running . as an independent once he has contested a party's primary. He has told the Associated Press that he won't run as a write-in candidate, effectively ending his political career. The voters in Cantor's very conservative congressional district spoke loud and clear, leading conservative activist Brent Bozell told . reporters Tuesday night. 'Eric . Cantor's loss tonight is an apocalyptic moment for the GOP . establishment,' Bozell said. 'The grassroots is in revolt and marching.' Dave Brat, the Randolph-Macon College economics professor who unseated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, has a lot more going for him than his policy visions. 'Total eye candy': Brat is liked by his students . Brat's students appreciate how he looks in a cardigan more than his approach to teaching and politics. His hotness rating on the site is a glowing red chili pepper - just a notch down from the site's best rating of combusting chili pepper. 'He's so charming,' wrote one, 'and really knows how to incorporate real world examples to keep the class exciting and relateable [sic].' 'He change[s] assignments a lot and sometimes it's unclear what he wants you to do. Plus he's total eye candy!!' Another said: 'Brat changes assignments all the time, but he is so charming, you forget to be mad at him'. 'Not a great teacher,' wrote another. 'Great guy, but almost too smart to teach.' A third seemed to mock his conservative street-cred: 'I was excited to take a class from a guy who promised to put a stop to immigrant ""amnesty,"" but at least 3 people in class were somewhat Mexican-looking and he did not deport a single one of them all semester. Also, requires purchase of 2 copies of ""Atlas Shrugged"" for some reason. Coffee breath.' Bozell is chairman of ForAmerica, an organization that has targeted moderate Republicans, including Cantor. Brat said after the race was called in his favor that his push to unseat Cantor had found a receptive audience among voters who were weary of partisan bickering – and of infighting within the GOP. 'The American people want to pay attention to serious ideas again,' he told a Fox News Channel audience. 'Our founding was built by people who were political philosophers and we need to get back to that, away from this kind of cheap political rhetoric of right and left.' Brat added: 'God acted through people on my behalf. It’s an unbelievable miracle.' Most Republican pollsters and election consultants were genuinely stunned by the results on Tuesday. One poll of 400 likely Republican primary voters conducted in late May for the Cantor campaign and shared with The Washington Post showed the incumbent with an improbable 62-28 lead. The McLaughlin & Associates opinion research firm said that its margin of error was +/- 4.9 percentage points, but it was off by 27. Six hours before the polls closed, the venerable Post predicted that Brat would 'fall far short.' 'Disorganization and poor funding have stymied the campaign of tea party activist David Brat,' read the opening salvo of a premature political obituary, 'even as he tapped into conservative resentment toward a party leader who has been courting the Republican right for years.' Cantor founded the . Republican Party's 'Young Guns' program along with 2012 vice presidential . candidate Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy . of California. They created the initiative in 2007 as a support system for a new generation of GOP candidates . running for open congressional seats or trying to unseat Democrat incumbents. But the program grew to take all comers after the National Republican Congressional Committee endorsed it – including challengers to sitting congressmen like . Cantor himself. Brat had . been a thorn in Cantor's side on the campaign trail, casting the . congressman as a Washington insider who isn't conservative enough. Last month, a feisty crowd of Brat supporters booed Cantor in front of his family at a local party convention. Cantor's . fuzzy position on immigration reform became a focal point of the race when Brat attacked his rival for what he said was a full embrace of 'amnesty' for illegal immigrants. 'Eric Cantor believes that we need to import more low-wage foreign . workers at the expense of lower wages and fewer jobs for Virginia . families,' Brat told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in an election survey that appeared in the paper on Monday. 'A vote for Eric Cantor is a vote for open . borders and corporate handouts,' Brat continued. Cantor has insisted that he opposes a quick path to citizenship for people living in the U.S. illegally. But he said . he could be open to limited programs, like one that would offer green . cards to young people brought to the U.S. by their parents, once they . served a term in the military. He . told the Times-Dispatch in his own survey responses that he believes . 'the immigration system is broken and we should make reforms in a . step-by-step approach.' But, added Cantor, 'I . do not and will not accept the president’s all-or-nothing approach.' He . also rejected a comprehensive immigration reform bill – which tea . partiers derided as a 'blanket amnesty' program – that has passed in the . Senate but stalled in the House. Pro-immigration . activists seemed to relish the chance to leverage the issue against a . powerful Republican. Twice in the last six months they protested . against Cantor in the lobby of his Arlington, Virginia condominium . building. A . jubilant group of amnesty advocates showed up to gloat at Cantor's . election-night headquarters following his concession speech. Si, se puede: Immigration reform activists crashed Cantor's election-night party, jubilant about bouncing him from office -- but perhaps not thinking ahead to the tea partier Brat's likely win in a heavily Republican district . The thrill is gone: Cantor supporters couldn't hide their shock and disappointment when election returns came in and the news got progressively worse . Brat's message apparently scored well with voters in the 7th District, which . includes part of Virginia's capitol city Richmond. He prevailed by . a double-digit margin. 'There . needs to be a change,' said Joe Mullins, who voted in Chesterfield . County Tuesday. The engineering company employee said he has friends who . tried to arrange town hall meetings with Cantor, who declined their . invitations. A major . rift between the GOP's establishment wing and tea party factions has . been a fixture in . Virginia since last year when tea party favorite Ken Cuccinelli lost the . governor's race to former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry . McAuliffe. Cantor . supporters responded by trying to wrest control of . the state party away from conservatives with tea party leanings, including in the majority leader's home district. But Tuesday's election result shows that the last laugh belongs to the 'Don't Tread On Me' crowd. Brat . teaches economics at Randolph-Macon College, a small liberal arts school north of . Richmond. He raised barely $200,000 for his campaign, according . to the most recent financial disclosure reports. The New York Times reported that Cantor’s campaign splashed out close to that amount just at steakhouses ($168,637). Cantor, by comparison, sat on a war chest of roughly $2 million. Politico reported . that he spent $120,000 printing campaign mailers, $13,000 on yard . signs, $370,000 on campaign ads and $30,000 on polling. Prominent . national conservative groups spent their own money to help Brat, who . also offset his financial and name-recognition disadvantages with . endorsements from conservative radio host Laura Ingraham and other . conservative activists. Heir no more: Cantor was considered the likely successor to House Speaker John Boehner (L), but instead his has become the highest-profile scalp on the tea party's wall . 'He really just didn’t have very much money, but what he did have was a lot of heart,' Ingraham told The New York Times. 'I think there will be a lot of people out there saying this could be the beginning of something really big for the Republican Party.' Brat . will now advance to the general election, where he will face off against Democratic Party nominee Jack Trammell, another professor at Randolph-Macon College. He teaches sociology. Within hours of the race's conclusion, Trammell's homespun campaign website was scrapped entirely, in favor or a flashier fundraising engine from ActBlue, a firm that boasts it has raised $515 million for Democrats since 2004. Republicans . have represented Virginia's 7th congressional district . since 1971 and its residents have not voted to elect a Democratic . president for more than 20 years, giving Brat a significant advantage in November. Cantor, a former state legislator, was elected to Congress in 2000. He became the Republicans' majority leader in 2011.","Cantor lost the primary to Tea Party-backed economics professor Dave Brat .
Brat has no political experience and raised little money for his campaign; he will now face a Democratic candidate who teaches at the same college .
Brat's campaign coffers barely scraped $200,000 whereas Cantor spent $168,000 at steakhouses alone .

"Patrick Lumumba who was falsely accused of murdering Meredith Kercher by Amanda Knox . The barman wrongly accused by Amanda Knox of murdering a British student has urged her to come to court 'if she is as innocent as she claims' - just hours ahead of a verdict in her appeal trial. Patrick Lumumba was held in custody for two weeks after Knox, 26, told police she had 'covered her ears as he killed' Meredith Kercher in her bedroom of the house she shared with her fellow student. As a result of the false accusation Lumumba was dragged from his home in front of his children and wife, in a dawn raid by police and taken to jail only being released when a university professor provided him with a rock solid alibi. Speaking ahead of Thursday's verdict, he said: 'If she (Knox) is innocent as she should come to court for the decision. 'I will be there. If she is so sure that she had nothing to do with it, then she should be in court to hear the judges decision.' The unemployed musician added: 'I think she is running away - I'm the one who has been left in a real mess because of what she said. 'My bar closed and my business folded - I have nothing now and no work. 'Because of what she said I was put in jail for two weeks and my bar was impounded by the police for four months. 'My friends tried t help me as best they could but it wasn't enough because they were all having a hard time as well. 'The false arrest had a real negative impact on my personal life and my business life - things have never really recovered and it's all because of what Amanda wrongly told the police. 'I haven't even been paid any compensation by her that I'm owed.' Scroll down for video . Patrick Lumumba (centre) walks with his lawyer after he was released by Italian police following the false accusation made by Amanda Knox . Knox was convicted of slandering Lumumba . and ordered to pay him 22,000 euros in 2011 and he was also later . awarded 8,000 euros in damages by the Italian state but he rejected this . to pursue a claim through the European Court of Human Rights. Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29, were charged with murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith in 2007, after she was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in the bedroom of her house in Perugia, Italy. Initially, both were convicted in 2009 and Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito to 25 years but then in 2011 the verdicts were sensationally overturned and both were allowed to go free. But last year, in a case that has been marked with numerous twists and turns, Italy's Supreme Court ordered a fresh retrial of the appeal. Waiting game: Sollecito and Amanda Knox (pictured) who split years ago, are awaiting verdicts in a retrial of their case in Italy, after their previous murder convictions were overturned in 2011 . That case began last September in Florence, 100 miles from where the murder took place. A verdict is due on Thursday and prosecutors have demanded custodial sentences be imposed on both Knox and Sollecito although neither will be in court for the verdict. Raffaele Sollecito walks outside the Florence court, on Monday, January 20 . Knox has remained in her home at Seattle, fearful of travelling although she did email the court to protest her innocence in a statement read out by her lawyer, in which she insisted she 'was not a monster.' Judge Alessandro Nencini described the emailed statement as 'unusual' adding that defendants 'should be in court if they wanted to speak.' Computer studies graduate Sollecito, from Bisceglie, near Bari, is now expected to be in court. There has been speculation in the Italian media that he would flee Italy ahead of the verdict especially as it has emerged that he has been spending a lot of time in the Caribbean paradise island of the Dominican Republic which has no extradition treaty. Prosecutors have already demanded that should a guilty verdict be returned by judge Alessandro Nencini then 'precautionary measures' should be imposed on Sollecito which could include house arrest and surrounding his passport. In Knox's case, it is not entirely clear if the Italian authorities will seek her extradition from the United States even though a treaty does exist between both countries. To add to the confusion any verdict will go to a further automatic appeal at the Supreme Court so any final decision is likely to be many months, if not years away. Court case: Sollecito walks past reporters outside the Florence court in Italy, on Monday of last week . This photo taken in November 2007 shows Amanda Knox (left) and Raffaele Sollecito (right) outside the rented house where 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was found dead . The retrial in Florence shifted the . motive away from a sex game gone wrong as was initially argued to a . simple bitter feud of jealousy between Knox and Meredith - with the . British girl uncomfortable at her flatmate's cleanliness and habit of . bringing men home. Death: Knox and Sollecito served four years in jail for murdering 21-year-old Leeds University student Meredith Kercher (pictured) in Perugia . However . Knox and her lawyers have hit back and insisted the theory is rubbish, . with Knox herself stressing that the two were 'good friends' and she has . expressed several times a desire to visit Meredith's grave and meet her . family. The DNA evidence . from the previous trial has also been revisited with experts being . called to testify in particular about a 30cm kitchen knife which was . found at Sollecito's home and which was believed to be the murder . weapon. At the initial conviction it was said DNA from Knox was on the handle and that of Meredith on the blade but the later trial and the appeal established that although there was indeed traces of the American, those of Meredith's were so tiny they should not be relied upon. Prosecutors want both Knox and Sollecito jailed for 26 years, with Knox having her one year sentence for slandering Lumumba increased to four. Meredith's sister Stephanie and brother Lyle are expected to travel from their home in Coulsdon, Surrey, for the verdict - the third time in seven years that they have attended a court trial related to the killing of their sibling. A third man, Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 27, is serving a 16 year sentence for the murder and sexual assault and he is expected to be released on parole next year. He, like Knox and Sollecito, has always protested his innocence.","Patrick Lumumba was held in custody for two weeks .

"Joe Calzaghe believes that his fellow Welshman Nathan Cleverly will profit from Tony Bellew’s anger when the two younger men collide for the second time in Liverpool on Saturday night. Calzaghe, who retired as the undefeated world super-middleweight champion, was the epitome of self-control in the ring. Cleverly and Bellew have moved up from light-heavyweight to cruiser for this re-match but the Merseyside man has been festering with resentment since losing their world title fight. Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew went head to head on Sky's The Gloves are Off show ahead of their fight . Cleverly is keeping cool and is determined to win for the second time against Bellew . Bellew is fired up for his re-match with rival Cleverly after losing the first bout between the two fighters . Bellew has made no secret of his angst but Calzaghe warns: ‘All this anger is not good for boxers. I don’t know Tony very well personally but it looks to me as if the hatred is burning up too much of his energy, . ‘I occasionally did some stuff for the cameras but it was to help sell the promotion, not for real. I was always cool, calm and collected in the ring and I believe that is very important. You need self-control and discipline in a fight. You should keep your emotions in check.’ Bellew has been anything but restrained in the build up and Cleverly says: ‘It seems he does hate me and really wants to hurt me.’ Cleverly and Bellew almost came to blows back in 2011 ahead of their first fight . Cleverly beat Bellew in their first fight back in 2011 and seemed to show respect to each other afterwards . Promoter Eddie Hearn reports that Bellew is more desperate to win this fight than any in his career so far and does not know how he would cope with losing to Cleverly. Although Bellew is the more natural light-heavy and will be the bigger man on the night, Calzaghe does not expect that to be to his advantage either. He says: Nathan was having troubled making the weight at super-middle so although he is moving up his speed will not be affected. ‘Bellew is a good fighter and a heavy puncher – but as we all know speed kills. ‘I’m not only saying this because Nathan and I are both Welsh and he is my friend,. I think you will see him relaxed, breathing easily and using his speed and skills to beat Bellew again. ‘Yes, Tony has home advantage but he had that in the first fight and since the hatred seems genuine the crowd might make him even more likely to go charging in. It looks like he’s got bad blood.’ Both boxers have been stopped in world title fights since they first met, Cleverly by Sergey Kovalev who has just ended the light-heavyweight reign of Bernard Hopkins, and Bellew by Adonis Stevenson, but the grudge element in this rematch has caught the imagination of the boxing public in this country, . Not only will the arena in Liverpool will be packed and roaring for Bellew but pay-TV sales projections are encouraging.

"Didn't vote in the last midterm elections? It turns out many of the celebrities pressuring young people to vote in tomorrow's off-year elections didn't cast a ballot last time, either. According to the Washington Post at least five stars who participated in a recent Rock the Vote video urging youth to exercise their franchise didn't bother to show up to the polls themselves in 2010. View co-host Whoopi Goldberg, Orange is the New Black's Natasha Lyonne, Glee's Darren Criss, Girls creator Lena Dunham and Rich Kids of Beverly Hills star E.J. Johnson did not vote in the last midterm election, the Post discovered. Lena Dunham and other celebrities in Rock the Votes Turn Out for What midterm election PSA didn't vote four years ago, their voting histories show . Records show that Glee's Darren Criss, Rich Kids of Beverly Hills star E.J. Johnson and Orange is the New Black's Natasha Lyonne didn't vote in the last midterm election . Dunham admittedly voted for her 'first time' in 2012 when she cast her ballot for President Barack Obama. However, the Post said it couldn't find evidence in the New York and Los Angeles voting records that her cohorts in the PSA visited the ballot box four years ago, either. Others celebs who made cameos in the Rock the Vote campaign may not have voted, the Post said, noting that it was unable to find information for musician Lil Jon and six others who appeared in the election-themed video. Asked about the apparent hypocrisy displayed by the celebrities who were determined not to have took part in the last midterm election, a spokeswoman for non-profit Rock the Vote said the stars had committed to voting this time around, and that's all that matters. 'Rock The Vote's approach is forward-looking,' Audrey Gelman told The Washington Post in an email. 'The talent who participate in our campaigns are registered to vote and have pledged to turn out this Tuesday and in upcoming elections,' she added. 'We believe individuals who have missed opportunities to vote in the past should not be disqualified from committing to participate in the political process in the future, and helping spread a positive message of civic engagement.' Whoopi Goldberg, cast in the parody video as Lil Jon's aunt, didn't cast a ballot in 2010, either . Dunham, pictured here dancing pantless in the video, admittedly voted for her 'first time' in 2012 . The non-partisan get out the vote organization released a star-studded video spoofing Lil Jon's summer hit Turn Down for What last month as part of its campaign to get young people to the polls on Election Day. Rock the Vote is a nonprofit get out the vote organization that targets young people. Though the organization itself claims to be non-partisan, its PSAs often feature openly Democratic celebrities. Lena Dunham, for instance, appeared in an ad for Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012. Darren Criss, who appears in the Turn Out for What video as well as a 2012 spot about the history of voting, headlined a fundraiser for Obama's reelection campaign. He also performed at Obama's second inauguration. Furthermore, the stars in the Lil Jon jam say they are voting in favor of traditionally liberal policy positions, including 'global warming awareness' and 'reproductive rights.' In the parody, Lil Jon goes to his area polling place to cast his vote. He bumps Dunham and celebrity trainer Tracy Andersen while there. During a dance interlude later in the video Dunham drops her pants and hops around in her underwear as other popular celebs stop by to explain why they plan to vote on Election Day. Prison-drama star Lyonne claims to be supporting criminal justice reform. Lil Jon notes that he's voting in favor of marijuana legalization. 'Hi, I'm Fred, and I'm turning out because I want to impress my friends,' 47-year-old Saturday Night Live alum Fred Armisen states, facetiously. 'That's the only reason to ever do anything.' A Harvard University Institute of Politics survey of young people released last week notes that only a quarter of 18-29 year olds voted in the last midterm elections and the same percentage plan to vote now. By a 51-47 percent margin the poll found young people prefer Republicans to win control of Congress - a stark contrast from just two years ago, when young people supported President Barack Obama en masse, and four years ago when they gave Democrats a 16-point bounce.","At least five stars in a recent Rock the Vote PSA urging youth to exercise their franchise didn't bother to show up to the polls themselves in 2010 .

When browsing for goods, don’t be fooled by a site ranked highly in search results. 3. PAY BY CREDIT CARD . For goods costing £100-plus, a credit card gives more protection than a debit card, prepaid card or PayPal. If an order goes astray, the goods break or the firm goes bust, you can claim from the card provider. Never pay by cash transfer. 4. SPEND £50 ON ANTI-VIRUS PROTECTION . From ‘phishing’ emails to spyware, fraudsters are adept at hacking online accounts, so get an up-to-date firewall from the likes of Norton or McAfee for £20 to £50. 5. PASSWORDS SHOULD NOT BE TOO PERSONAL . Avoid obvious names or dates, and try not to use the same password for all sites. To create a complex password, use a mnemonic: for example, pick a song, the year it came out, and stick a £ sign at the end. You can vary it for different websites by adding the first two letters of the site you’re visiting. 6. SWITCH OFF OR LOG OUT . Turn off a PC if you’re not using it, especially after a browsing session (a favourite time for hackers). If a site offers you a choice of storing your payment details or making a one-off purchase, go for the latter. 7. USE A STORE’S APP . If you’re buying gifts and using your smartphone, do it on the retailer’s app rather than using the main website. A dedicated app, if available, offers greater software protection than a web browser, especially if you’re in a public place. 8. IF YOU’RE STILL NERVOUS . Choose websites that allow you to order online but pay only when you pick up the goods in person. High Street names including Waterstones, Argos and PC World now offer this.","UK consumers are expected to spend £600million in 24 hours on what could be come busiest online shopping day'

"Deepening scandal: Paul Flowers was handed a £60,000 'golden goodbye' after he resigned, despite leading the bank to the brink of collapse . The scandal surrounding former Co-op Bank chief Paul Flowers deepened last night after it was revealed he quit a drugs charity over allegations of up to £150,000 in false expenses claims. The Methodist minister – under police investigation for buying crystal meth and crack cocaine – was suspended by the Lifeline Project after allegedly lodging ‘significant’ false claims between 1992 and 2004. The Manchester-based charity conducted a full investigation, but former Co-op chairman Flowers, who was its chairman of trustees, resigned before its conclusion. Last night, charity chief executive Ian Wardle confirmed the Charity Commission was informed of the findings but it is not thought any action was taken. Mr Wardle described the money as a ‘significant sum’ which required a ‘lengthy and thorough investigation’. The revelations will only reinforce concerns that City regulators, the Co-op board and Labour failed to adequately investigate the past of the drug-taking minister who was once invited to Ed Miliband’s office for private talks. As Labour insisted the affair was a ‘desperate political distraction’, it was revealed: . Flowers was last night still in hiding – three days after it was revealed he paid £300 for Class A drugs during a deal captured on film. Investigation: Police at the home of disgraced Mr Flowers today - he is being investigated by police for allegedly buying crystal meth and crack cocaine . He lodged the expense claims during his voluntary tenure at the Lifeline Project – a charity providing services for those with drug and alcohol addictions. A charity insider said Flowers claimed an astonishing £150,000 between 1992 and 2004. Mr Wardle would not confirm the exact figure but said that Flowers had been suspended immediately when concerns were raised. He said: ‘Trustees at Lifeline are disappointed to hear the news regarding Rev Paul Flowers this week. Ed Miliband hosted dinners for disgraced bank chief Paul Flowers at one of London’s plushest restaurants, it emerged yesterday. Labour sources confirmed that Flowers, then chairman of the Co-op Bank, attended two dinners at the Cinnamon Club as a member of the Labour leader’s elite Business and Industry Advisory Board. The shamed Methodist minister was recruited by Mr Miliband in 2011 to advise him on banking reform, although it has since emerged he had no banking qualifications. The dinners, in July and November of 2011, were both attended by about 20 Labour-friendly business people, allowing them extraordinary access to the Labour leader. They are likely to have cost thousands of pounds. The Cinnamon Club in Westminster specialises in modern Indian cuisine and is one of the most expensive restaurants of its kind. A typical meal there could easily cost upwards of £80 per head. Specials on last night’s menu included ‘spice crusted fillet steak of Wagyu beef with stir-fried baby morels and saffron sauce’, priced at £95. The wine list includes a number of vintage bottles, such as a Chateau Latour 1959, which costs £3,130. 'Paul Flowers and Lifeline parted company in 2004. When concerns were identified regarding Rev Flowers’s expenses, I took immediate steps with the assistance of Lifeline’s solicitor to suspend Rev Flowers.’ Mr Wardle added: ‘The Charity Commission was also fully informed of the findings of the investigation and the outcome. Rev Flowers resigned from his (voluntary and unpaid) position as chairman of trustees before our own internal proceedings could be concluded.’ The charity’s income is generated via public sector grants and local contracts and a variety of small local and specialist scheme funds. In another development, it emerged that Flowers was made chairman of governors of a Yorkshire primary school after pornography was found on his council laptop. He was given the prestigious role at Lidget Green School, Bradford, after he had resigned over the laptop incident in 2011. The school said last night it had not been told by the council about the incident and had ‘no reason to believe’ he had resigned for reasons other than those he had officially stated. This was that he had ‘increasing and competing demands’ on his time. Flowers, who has been ‘suspended indefinitely’ from the Methodist Church, led the Co-op Bank for three years. Earlier this week it was revealed that he used his Co-op email account to hire a rent boy for sex. Ciaron Dodd said they met for depraved sessions in plush hotels – in rooms paid for by the struggling Co-op. It has also emerged that Flowers was convicted of gross indecency in a public toilet with a man in 1981, but he was forgiven by the Methodist Church. He admitted the offence at Fareham Magistrates’ Court in Hampshire, and was fined £75 with £35 legal costs. Allegations: Ciaron Dodd, left, claims that he met Flowers, right, in plush hotels paid for by the struggling Co-op for depraved sex sessions . Bradford Council was under fire last night after apparently failing to inform Labour Party headquarters of the gay porn found on Paul Flowers’ work laptop. The former banking boss was allowed to continue with his high-profile role with the party even after resigning from the council in disgrace. Flowers, 63, was confronted by council officials in 2011 after IT workers found the images while mending his computer. High profile: Flowers (right) with Lord Mayor of Bradford Peter Hill . He resigned immediately – but the official reason given was that he was leaving for family reasons and because of his high-pressured job at Co-op Bank. Last night, it emerged that senior executives at the council were aware of the incident, as was the then Labour leader of the council. But no one thought it was appropriate to make public the real reasons behind his departure. Flowers was even appointed as chairman of the governors at Lidget Green Primary School, in Bradford, after he had resigned as councillor. Last night, there was anger among councillors who said the public had a right to know what Flowers had done. Councillor Paul Cromie said: ‘This looks like a cover-up. When Flowers resigned, there was a press release issued which said his workload was too heavy. ‘If the council leader knew the real reason at the time, then he should have told Labour HQ. It would have been his duty. 'I also think the electorate had a right to know – after all, they are the ones that elected him.’ The leader of the council when Flowers resigned was Ian Greenwood, who lost his seat to a Respect Party candidate in May 2012. Before Flowers left, he said: ‘Paul is a tremendously gifted and committed individual who has made a significant and lasting contribution to the community in Great Horton, to the council and to the Labour group. ‘I will be sad to see him go but I fully understand the reasoning behind Paul’s decision.’ But despite his public praise, it now appears he knew about the porn – and chose not to make it widely known. Councillor David Green, current leader of Bradford Council, said he did not know whether his predecessor had taken action. He said: ‘I don’t know what happened at the time and I don’t know who was given information. If the Labour Party are saying that they weren’t informed then I have no reason to disbelieve them.’ A council spokesman said it was not considered necessary to alert Labour headquarters or the public because Flowers had not broken the law – just council rules. Connections: Flowers, pictured here (centre) at a Downing Street reception in 2010, was once invited to Ed Miliband¿s office for private talks . The spokesman said: ‘It must be emphasised that this material was not illegal. In the light of the resignation no further investigations into how the material came to be on the computer were required. ‘It was a potential breach of the council’s internal policy.’ A Labour spokesman yesterday insisted Ed Miliband and other senior figures were not told why Flowers had been forced to resign from Bradford council, but did not deny that some MPs and shadow ministers may have known. The spokesman said: ‘The leader of the Labour Party did not know, the shadow cabinet did not know. No one who could reasonably be described as being in a position of leadership knew about this.’ Mr Greenwood was not able to be contacted yesterday.","Paul Flowers was suspended by drug and alcohol charity Lifeline Project .

"A British explorer is celebrating leading a team of cavers to the lowest depth ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. Chris Jewell, 31, spent seven weeks with his group navigating the Sistema Huautla cave system in Mexico, one of the most remote places ever reached inside the earth. Located in Sierra Mazatec mountains, the cave system has 17 entrances and endless different routes into the centre. British explorer Chris Jewell spent seven weeks navigating the huge Sistema Huautla cave system in Mexico . Explorers were dwarfed in the vast Anthodite Hall, the largest chamber in the caves . Jason Mallinson, from Huddersfield, pictured carrying diving gear through a sump reached the deepest into the earth that anyone has been in the Western Hemisphere . The group of cave explorers scaled raging rivers as they reached the bottom of the caves . Jewell's group, made up of 40 . people from around the world, managed to dive, swim, climb and descend . through a labyrinth of pitch black tunnels. They had the gruelling task of . navigating eerie, water-filled abysses known as sumps. At one stage . swam underwater in darkness for 600 metres in a 28 metre deep river. During these dives, the group had no knowledge of where they were heading. Team member Jason Mallinson, from Huddersfield, reached the depth of . 1,545 metres, the deepest anyone has been in the Western Hemisphere - . and the eighth deepest in history. The group beat the previous record of 1,484 metres set nearby . in the Cheve caves while the previous record in Sistema Huautla was . 1,475 metres. The experience is a far cry from Chris Jewell's day job, where he works an office-based software consultant in Manchester. For the expedition, Chris managed to negotiate nine weeks' unpaid leave. He said: 'You don't know what is happening in front of you but we traced the water's route to a canyon seven miles away. 'We knew where it is heading but we didn't know what was between.

"Astronomers at Nasa have discovered a pink alien planet orbiting a star like our sun 57 light-years away that they said is the smallest by mass photographed so far. Scientists believe the planet, GJ 504b, is thought to be a magenta colour, based on infrared data from the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii. While GJ 504b is the the lowest-mass planet ever detected around a star using direct imaging techniques, but it is still several times the mass of Jupiter and similar in size. The planet, GJ 504b (pictured) is the smallest exoplanet by mass orbiting a star like our sun, some 57 light-years away. It is thought to be a magenta colour, based on infrared data from the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii . Michael McElwain, a member of the discovery team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, said: 'If we could travel to this giant planet, . we would see a world still glowing from the heat of its formation with a . color reminiscent of a dark cherry blossom, a dull magenta.' 'Our near-infrared camera reveals that . its color is much more blue than other imaged planets, which may . indicate that its atmosphere has fewer clouds.' GJ 504b orbits its star at nearly nine times the distance Jupiter orbits the sun, which poses a challenge to theoretical ideas of how giant planets form. According to the most widely accepted theory, called the core-accretion model, Jupiter-like planets begin their life in the gas-rich debris disk that surrounds a young star, Francis Reddy of Nasa explained. This composite combines Subaru images of GJ 504 using two near-infrared wavelengths (orange, 1.6 micrometers, taken in May 2011 and blue, 1.2 micrometers, April 2012). Once processed to remove scattered starlight, the images reveal the orbiting planet, GJ 504b . A core produced by collisions among asteroids and comets provides a 'seed' and when this core reaches sufficient mass, its gravitational pull rapidly attracts gas from the disk to form the planet. While this theory holds true for planets in our solar system out to where Neptune orbits, it is more problematic for worlds located farther from their stars. Pink planet GJ 504b lies at a projected distance of 43.5 astronomical units from its star - which is around one-and-a-half times the distance Neptune is from our sun. Markus Janson, a Hubble postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University in New Jersey said: 'This is among the hardest planets to explain in a traditional planet-formation framework.' 'Its discovery implies that we need to seriously consider alternative formation theories, or perhaps to reassess some of the basic assumptions in the core-accretion theory.' The astronomers said GJ 504b is about four times the mass of Jupiter and has a temperature of around 237 Celsius. Its star,  GJ 504 also known as 59 Virginis (circled) is slightly hotter than the sun and can be seen in the constellation Virgo in this chart and can be seen without using a telescope, according to Nasa . The research is part of the Strategic Explorations of Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru (SEEDS), a project to directly image extrasolar planets and protoplanetary disks around several hundred nearby stars using the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The five-year project began in 2009 and is led by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). While direct imaging is arguably the most important technique for observing planets around other stars, it is also the most challenging. Masayuki Kuzuhara at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, who led the discovery team, said: 'Imaging provides information about the planet’s luminosity, temperature, atmosphere and orbit, but because planets are so faint and so close to their host stars, it's like trying to take a picture of a firefly near a searchlight.' The astronomers said GJ 504b is about four times the mass of Jupiter and has a temperature of around 237 Celsius. Its star is slightly hotter than the sun, which can be seen in the constellation Virgo. The study on GJ 504b will be published in The Astrophysical Journal.","Nasa believes the planet, GJ 504b is a magenta colour, based on infrared data from the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii .

"Moroccans outraged by a royal pardon for a Spanish paedophile serving a 30-year sentence for raping 11 children in the North African kingdom are planning a protest in Rabat on Friday. The convicted paedophile is among 48 jailed Spaniards who were pardoned by King Mohamed VI on Tuesday at the request of Spain's King Juan Carlos, who visited Morocco last month, according to state news agency MAP. The decision prompted a frenzy of angry postings on social media in Morocco. Activists from the February 20 movement, which organised anti-government demonstrations during the Arab unrest of 2011, has called for Friday's rally in the Moroccan capital. King's deal: The convicted paedophile is among 48 . jailed Spaniards who were pardoned by King Mohamed VI, right, on Tuesday at the . request of Spain's King Juan Carlos, left, who visited Morocco last month . 'The king's pardon is a second rape for the victims,' a woman identifying herself as Meryem El said on Twitter. Hamid Krayri, a lawyer for families of the victims, named the paedophile as Daniel Fino Galvan and said he had been convicted 18 months ago by criminal courts in Kenitra, near Rabat, of raping and filming children aged between 4 and 15. 'He is a retired Spaniard who owns two flats here in Kenitra,' Krayri, who is a member of Morocco's Human Rights Association, told Reuters. He said he had filed a complaint against Galvan three years ago when activists had shown him video discs containing footage of the Spaniard and his victims. Outraged Moroccans are expected to protest in Rabat, the kingdom's capital, tomorrow . Galvan's lawyer, Mohamed Benjeddo, said his client had been freed on Wednesday and planned to leave for Spain the next day. The Spanish embassy declined to confirm Galvan's release. The palace and the government made no immediate comment. The king, like other Middle Eastern rulers, often pardons prisoners on special occasions, such as Throne Day on July 30, but the decision to release the Spaniards at the request of the monarch of a former colonial power has riled many in Morocco. 'Is this Morocco's way to reach the long-sought target of 10 million tourists a year?' asked blogger Nouhad Fathi in a sarcastic post on her Facebook wall.","Daniel Fino Galvan raped and filmed 11 children, aged 4 to 15, in Kenitra .

"They aren't exactly two peas in a pod, but Brian May and Sir Patrick Moore shared a bond in science — and were so close that the guitarist even bought Sir Patrick's house to make sure he could live there for the rest of his life. Brian bought Farthings, the house in Selsey, West Sussex for £480,000 in 2008, paying about £40,000 above the market value to ensue the astronomer could stay in the home he had lived in for four decades. Sir Patrick Moore died peacefully at his home last week, aged 89. Brian May, right, and Sir Patrick Moore pictured in 2008. The pair shared a twin love of music and science . According to The Sunday Times, Brian leased the property back to Moore on the same day he bought it — charging 'one peppercorn if demanded' for a 25-year lease. However, the Queen guitarist is furious about the Sunday Times' report and has released an angry statement on his website. It reads: 'Sir Patrick Moore is not even laid to rest yet, but I have just heard that The Sunday Times (yes, them again) have been sneaking around, like the carrion eaters they are, and are now about to ""reveal"" all the details they've managed to sniff out about how we, as Patrick's friends, helped him in his latter years, to stay functional in his own home to the very end. 'I'm actually amazed and quite disgusted that these press people are so intrusive and nosy. 'Is there no respect at all? 'These matters were private, between friends. What motivates these grubby little people to go snooping around?' Music of the spheres: Sir Patrick Moore was a keen xylophone player . In a statement to The Guardian, May said it was too soon to decide the future of the house, but hinted it's myriad scientific treasures could be opened up for the public to see. He said: 'It's too early to be able to comment meaningfully on this. As Patrick's friends, we have been discussing possible futures for some time, but until now the first priority has always been safeguarding the quality of Patrick's life while he was alive. 'It will take time to assess what the possibilities now are.' May, who has an estimate fortune of £90m, described Sir Patrick as a 'father figure' who inspired him to study for a PhD in astrophysics. He had been a fan of the astronomer since childhood, when he begged his parents to let him stay up late to watch The Sky At Night, the show Sir Patrick presented for 55 years. The two connected in person after working on a radio play together, and later co-authored the book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. They also shared a love of music – Sir Patrick was a self-taught xylophone player, and at Farthings he had one rule for guests: nobody was to touch the xylophone. Moore also wrote more than 100 musical compositions, including a march in praise of Halley’s Comet, and once listened to a Viennese waltz on his car radio before realising he had written it. The astronomer was a well-known socialite, and often hosted parties at Selsey with Brian and his wife Anita Dobson. Sir Patrick bough Farthings for £4,000 in cash in 1967. It was also home to his private observatory . In the event of his death, the astronomer was clear about what he wanted. He would not have a funeral, but a party – ‘Quite a show. Plenty of drink.’ His family and friends have vowed to do just that. Sir Patrick bough Farthings for £4,000 in cash in 1967. Eventually, he had four observatories in his back garden and was devastated when they were damaged in a storm in 1998. But the house was never financially secure. Neighbours said Sir Patrick instead spent his money on telescopes, annual New Year's Eve parties for the village and helping young astronomers through university. Neighbour Eileen Nolan, 73, said: 'He never was aware how much money he had or how little he had. Quite often the accountant said, ""No more spending this week, Patrick."" 'Brian said if ever I saw him looking as though he was getting into trouble to give him a call. So I did. And he just turned up.' In an obituary for the astronomer, Brian May wrote of his friend's generous nature: 'His dedication to young aspiring astronomers was legendary. 'He gave away any income he made to the point where he had no security himself except that which his friends supplied.'","May, also a stargazer, bought his friend and mentor's home so he could stay there until his death .

"Accused: Amy Belliveau allegedly had a relationship with a 'high functioning' special needs student . A 43-year-old married special education teacher has been arrested for allegedly having a sexual relationship with one of her students. Amy Belliveau, who was in her first year of teaching for the district in Newington, Connecticut, allegedly had sexual contact with the 20-year-old student between April and June this year. It is against state law for a school employee to have sexual contact with a student, regardless of the student's age. Officials described the pupil as a 'high-functioning' special needs student. An investigation into her conduct was launched after a tip from the school district on June 13. She was placed on administrative leave from Newington Transitional Academy when the investigation was launched and she was fired following her arrest. Schools Superintendent William C. Collins told the Hartford Courant that the district worked jointly with police after they began to . suspect a sexual relationship had occurred. He said he was 'thrilled' that an arrest had been made in the case. On Thursday, Belliveau turned herself in after learning a warrant had been issued for her arrest. Scene: She was investigated after her school in Newington, Connecticut tipped off police in July . She has been charged with eight counts of second-degree sexual assault. She posted bail and will be back in court on October 9. Belliveau, who lives in New Britain, has been married to husband Peter since 1997 and they have two children. Although it was her first year with the district, records show that Belliveau began teaching elementary school and high school art classes after receiving her Connecticut Teacher’s Certification in 1996. The school teaches life skills to 18- to 21-year-old students with varying needs. Home: She lives with her husband of 16 years and their two children in New Britain, Connecticut . Former Newington elementary school teacher Soldelis Garcia told FoxCT: 'We try so hard to work with our students and to have one of our colleagues to do something like that is just sad. 'Parents entrust us with their children and then that trust is taken away [by something like this] and it gives us a bad stigma.'","Amy Belliveau, a mother-of-two, was in her first year of teaching for the district in Newington, Connecticut when 'they had three-month affair'

Weapon? Gonzalez was allegedly carrying this model of blade - the three-and-a-half-inch Spyderco VG-10 folding knife . An unidentified family member said: 'His job was running patrols in Baghdad when his Humvee was hit.' 'A portion of his foot was amputated - and the evidence is the limp you see in the video of him running across the White House lawn.' Military sources told the newspaper he served until 2012, when he was honorably discharged. According to family members, for part of his time in the Army he was a sniper. It also emerged today that Gonzalez, of Copperas Grove, Texas, was allegedly carrying a serrated blade with him —  despite earlier claims that he had been entirely unarmed. A police affidavit, seen by ABC News, said that he had a Spyderco VG-10 black folding knife in the front pocket of his pants when he was arrested. In the wake of his attempt on the White House, the Secret Service announced new, tougher security. It came shortly after another man — Kevin Carr of Shamong, New Jersey — was apprehended trying to get inside on Saturday, less than 24 hours after Gonzalez's alleged dash.

'These are good men . and women, but the Secret Service leadership has a lot of questions to . answer.' 'Was the door open?' he added incredulously.

Experts say Friday's breach was the first time in recent memory that an intruder actually made it inside the White House after hopping the fence. The attempts, however, have been many: . Sept. 11: A 'Pokemon' nut wearing a bright-yellow Pikachu hat was caught walking down the North Lawn seconds after jumping. His motives remain unclear. Aug. 7: A presidential address on Iraq was postponed — and the whole place put on lockdown — after a toddler squeezed through the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue, making it onto the lawn. June 2013: Joseph Reel, of Ohio, crashed a driverless Jeep into the fence to create a distraction so he could enter and spray paint the White House. He was sentenced to 3 years behind bars. November 2009: Three people crashed a state dinner for Indian Premier Manmohan Singh. They somehow made it past several security checkpoints and even met President Obama. 2001-2009: Six people jumped the fence — but were all caught almost immediately after landing on the grass. One of them, Brian Patterson, was on his third attempt when he was caught in April 2006 . Although . it is not uncommon for people to make it over the White House fence, . they're typically stopped almost immediately and rarely get very far. Video . from the scene showed the Friday intruder, Gonzalez, sprinting across the lawn as Secret . Service agents shouted at nearby pedestrians to clear the area. 'This situation was a little different than other incidents we have at the White House,' Donovan said. 'This . incident . is the most shocking example yet of how dangerously lax the Secret . Service has become, failing at its most basic job — to protect the . president and first family in the White House,' said Washington insider . Ronald Kessler, who's written several books on the Secret Service. He added to MailOnline: 'Because of corner cutting and an ingrained cultural attitude by . management of ""we make do with less,"" the Secret Service is not . protecting the White House with adequate agents and uniformed officers . and is not keeping up to date with the latest devices for detecting . intruders and weapons of mass destruction' Kessler . — who revealed the embarrassing scandal about Secret Service agents . hiring prostitutes in Colombia — said it's 'arrogance' that the White . House doesn't even have a front door lock. 'If . the intruder were carrying chemical, biological or radiological weapons . and President Obama and his family had been in, we would have had a . dead president as well as a dead first family,' said Kessler, who . authored 'The First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the .

"A study found people are still most-likely to contact members of their own racial background on dating websites . Race still matters when it comes to searching for a partner - at least online, according to a new study. A sociologist has found that members of dating sites are most likely to contact individuals who share their own racial background, on dating websites. Professor Kevin Lewis studied the interaction patterns of 126,134 users of dating website OkCupid.com in the U.S. over a  two-and-a-half month period. The sociologist, from the University of California, San Diego, found the tendency to initiate contact with someone from a shared race, is strongest among Asians and Indians and . weakest among whites, the study said. Professor Lewis only took heterosexual interactions 'for apples-to-apples comparison with the majority of previous findings' into account and only for individuals who identified themselves as one of the website's five most popular racial categories, including: Black, White, Asian (East Asian), Hispanic/Latino and Indian (South Asian). In the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he analysed the first message sent and the first reply - only looking at the data about the sender, receiver and time stamp of the message, rather than its content, which was stripped. While he said white people were the most likely to consider relationships with people from other ethnic backgrounds, he said the biggest 'reversals' in preference, are observed among groups that display the greatest tendency towards in-group bias. Professor Lewis' study also found that a person who is contacted by someone from a different racial background for the first time is more likely to reply, which he explains using his theory about 'pre-emptive discrimination'. 'Based on a lifetime of experiences in a . racist and racially segregated society, people anticipate discrimination . on the part of a potential recipient and are largely unwilling to reach . out in the first place,' he said. The study found that once an individual has replied to a suitor from a different race on an online dating site, they are more likely to cross racial lines and initiate interracial contact in the future . 'But if a person of another race expresses interest in them first, their . assumptions are falsified and they are more willing to take a chance on . people of that race in the future.' However, the assistant professor of sociology in the UC San Diego Division of Social Sciences, warns that the effect is sort-lived as people go back to habitual patterns in around a week. Explaining why, Professor Lewis said: 'The new-found optimism is quickly overwhelmed by the status quo and the normal state of affairs. 'Racial bias in assortative mating is a . robust and ubiquitous social phenomenon and one that is difficult to . surmount even with small steps in the right direction. We still have a . long way to go.' Professor Kevin Lewis studied the interaction patterns of 126,134 users of dating website OkCupid.com. The study found found the tendency to initiate contact with someone from a shared race, is strongest among Asians and Indians. White people were the most likely to . consider relationships with people from other ethnic backgrounds, it said. The biggest 'reversals' in preference, are observed among groups that display the greatest tendency towards in-group bias. An estimated 20 per cent of heterosexual relationships now begin online. Earlier research into racial bias in . assortative mating (or the non-random pairings of people with similar . traits) had trouble disentangling how much was due to prejudice and how . much to geography or meeting opportunities. However, Professor Lewis said he was able to take these factors into account with his analysis. 'Online dating is providing new insights into the timeless social process of finding a romantic partner,' he added. An estimated 20 per cent of heterosexual relationships and almost 70 per cent of same-sex relationships now begin online, providing a rich source of data for social scientists. Previous work on mate selection has often . been based on marriage records, which don't contain any information . about a romance's early days, or on self-report surveys, when people are . more likely to present themselves in the best, least-prejudiced light. While the study might make for depressing reading, Professor Lewis said it shows people are more likely to reciprocate . a cross-race message than previous research would lead to scientists to . expect. Once an individual has replied to a suitor from a different race, they are more likely to cross racial lines and . initiate interracial contact in the future. Professor Lewis says internet dating is able to begin to change humans' ingrained patterns of choosing partners because they are often based on false premises.","Sociologist Professor Kevin Lewis found individuals are still most-likely to contact people who share their own racial background on dating websites .

"Scandal: This is the 18-year-old British girl who was filmed performing sex acts on 24 men at a nightclub in Majorca's notorious party capital, Magaluf . The British girl who was filmed performing a sex act on 24 men in Majorca was told she would win a 'holiday' - but it was just the name of a £4 cocktail, it was today claimed. The 18-year-old, who is yet to be named, was captured on video working her way through holidaymakers at a nightclub in the island’s notorious party capital of Magaluf. Donning pink hotpants and a white vest top, she was cheered on by revellers as she moved from man to man, encouraging each of them to take their trousers down. The two-minute footage was later posted online and quickly went viral, sparking outrage among local politicians and women's rights groups. Last night, police launched an inquiry into the incident, which took place during an event organised by Carnage Magaluf at Alex's Bar. Now, it has been claimed that the girl agreed to perform the sex acts after being told by party organisers she would win a 'holiday' for taking part. But her prize, in fact, reportedly turned out to be a cocktail named 'Holiday', made from gin, vodka, peach schnapps, blackcurrant liqueur and fruit juice. A man called Kieran, 26, who said he was at the club at the time, told The Sun: 'The girl was being encouraged to drink more and more and was told she would win a 'holiday' if she took part in this game. 'Unfortunately the 'holiday' turned out to be the name of a cocktail. I feel sorry for her now. She must feel awful.' The shocking video, posted on local newspaper sites, shows the DJ apparently counting the number of men the girl notched up on the dancefloor, while playing the song Sexy and I Know It. The men can be seen sporting T-shirts from Carnage Magaluf, a company which takes young Britons on pub crawls, which is not linked to Carnage UK, a separate party organiser. Meanwhile, several holidaymakers are captured taking photos of the 'game' on their mobile phones. The girl, who reportedly works as a mobile phone sales rep, is believed to have flown to Spain for seven-night holiday with a friend last month. Locals immediately suggested she was British, as are the vast majority of tourists in a resort which has a reputation for excess. Scene: The girl was captured on video working her way through holidaymakers at Alex's Bar (pictured) Footballer Nathan Redmond was among Twitter users who condemned the act, calling it 'sickening' Under . Ellie Stevenson branded the footage 'vile' as social media users took . to Twitter to vent their outrage after the minute-long clip was posted . The footage has been described as a new low in Magaluf, where pub crawls were . regulated for the first time this year following complaints. Mayor . Manu Onieva voiced his ‘absolute indignation’ and said police were . investigating the practice that local press have dubbed ‘mamading’ – a . play on the crude Spanish word for a sex act, ‘mamada’. Benefits Street star White Dee was a guest of Carnage Magaluf in May and was photographed at a party wearing the company’s T-shirt. Party capital: Magaluf, popular for its cheap clubs and bars, has earned its reputation as one of the top places for drinking and clubbing holidays in Europe. It is especially popular with British tourists (file picture) The . 42-year-old mother of two, real name Deirdre Kelly, claims £10,000 a . year in benefits but flew to the resort despite being ‘too depressed’ to . work. She . returned to the resort last month and had been due to go on another pub . crawl organised by the firm. Dozens of posts about the incident appeared on the firm’s Twitter feed, with some claiming it happens ‘everywhere every day’. Reports said other tourists were being offered free drinks in similar sex competitions. Backlash: The images have provoked a debate on Twitter, with some coming to the defence of the girl . Spain’s Women’s Institute called it ‘degenerate, discriminatory and unfair’ towards women. The . More for Majorca opposition party demanded that the activity be . penalised, saying it was ‘an absolutely irresponsible and unhealthy way . of enjoying leisure time’. Politician David Abril asked: ‘Where is the responsible tourism we all want?’ Residents . of Magaluf have long complained about drunken Britons wreaking havoc on . the island, injuring themselves during all night drinking sessions and . blocking off roads through towns. Famous faces: Georgie Shore's Jay Gardner (pictured, left, in the video) featured in the footage, but did not take part in the sex game. Meanwhile, Benefits Street star White Dee (right) was a guest of Carnage Magaluf in May . Meanwhile, Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner has confirmed he also featured in the video . as the girl asked him whether he wanted to be 'number 25'. The . reality TV star can be seen at the end of the footage sticking his . middle finger up at the blonde woman, who then walks away. Speaking to The Mirror, . he said he been taking part in the bar crawl, but had decided not . to take part in the sex game, calling it 'the most shocking thing I've . seen.' However, he added that he would not hesitate to go back to the infamous party island. The . paper also reported that young Britons taking part in the bar crawl had . been plied with unlimited free alcohol for more than four hours before . the video was shot. Magaluf, popular for its cheap clubs and bars, has earned its reputation as one of the top places for drinking and clubbing holidays in Europe. It is especially popular with British tourists, who will fill the hundreds of bars on a 24-hour basis until September.

"A 29-year-old English teacher who allegedly had a four-month affair with her underage student and aborted his child, has been charged. Jennifer Christine Fichter was arrested yesterday after allegedly confessing to the 17-year-old boy's mother that she'd had sex with the teen up to 30 times, loved him and had no regrets. The Central Florida Aerospace Academy teacher was arrested about 11.40pm last night and charged with six counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor. The teen has not been identified. Scroll down for video . Charged: Jennifer Christine Fichter, 29 (pictured), allegedly confessed to having sex with her 17-year-old student for four months, falling in love with him and having an abortion . According to The Tampa Tribune, police said the abuse began in November when the pair had sex in the early . morning hours in Fichter's Toyota pickup truck. The teen told detectives he and Fichter met for sex three times in the parking lot of a Lakeland apartment complex and three times near New Tampa Highway. He also said they had sex four times outside the city in Polk and Hillsborough. Lakeland police said those counties are investigating those incidents. The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27. When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'. Police said the mum confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter. The mother reported Fichter to police yesterday, however it is not clear why she waited so long.

"Mark Sandell, 53, who was a senior BBC editor, is appealing against the BBC decision after a disciplinary panel recommended he be dismissed . A senior BBC editor and partner of radio presenter Victoria Derbyshire has been sacked following claims of bullying and sexual harassment and an investigation into his expenses. Mark Sandell, editor of BBC radio’s World Have Your Say (WHYS), becomes the first executive to be dismissed in the wake of damaging bullying allegations revealed by The Mail on Sunday that have dogged the broadcaster for the past two years. Mr Sandell left his wife of two years Fi Glover, a top BBC radio presenter, for Miss Derbyshire, also one of the Corporation’s stars, in 2002. The couple have two children. He is appealing against the BBC decision, after a disciplinary panel recommended he be dismissed. Bosses began an investigation into 53-year-old Mr Sandell, who has worked at the Corporation for 25 years, more than a year ago after claims he bullied and sexually harassed a member of staff. Separately, he was investigated over expenses. It is understood he was told he was being dismissed earlier this month, days before the BBC announced it was axeing WHYS, one of its flagship shows abroad. Later the BBC announced she was to present a new daily news and current affairs programme on the BBC News Channel. A friend of Mr Sandell said he was appealing. The senior BBC manager said: ‘Everyone has been shocked at the outcome. 'The process is still ongoing and Mark is appealing on the grounds it is disproportionate and continues to have full support of his team.’ The source added that some at the Corporation felt that Mr Sandell was a ‘scapegoat’. Earlier this year, the BBC faced criticism after two high-profile bullying cases saw managers keep their jobs, despite multiple allegations being upheld against them. The decisions appeared to contradict the BBC’s supposed tough new stance on bullying, the result of a damning report into culture at the broadcaster by Dinah Rose QC. Mr Sandell left his wife of two years Fi Glover (right) - a top BBC radio presenter - for Victoria Derbyshire, 45 (left), who is also a successful presenter for the BBC, in 2002. The pair now have two children together . Rod McKenzie was removed as head of Newsbeat, Radio 1’s news programme for youngsters, after being investigated for more than 30 complaints. He denied the claims, some of which were not upheld, but was given a final written warning and moved to head of development for local radio. Jim Buchanan, a news manager, received a written warning after an investigation upheld claims that he bullied and intimidated staff. He was given the role of head of outside broadcasts for the First World War project on the same pay, leading some to believe he was in fact ‘promoted’. WHYS, which airs on radio on the World Service and television on BBC World News, will end in 2015. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on staff matters.’ The BBC has been accused of ‘burying’ the cost of a £380,000 inquiry into sexual harassment and bullying, writes Miles Goslett. The Respect At Work Review was established in October 2012 in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. It was chaired by Dinah Rose QC, and more than 550 interviews were held with BBC employees by an external communications agency, Change Associates. Results were published in a 60-page report in May 2013, but the BBC repeatedly refused to say how much the review cost until last week. On Monday, the Corporation slipped the figure out by inserting a sentence on to an existing BBC web page, without alerting anybody it had done so. The inquiry came to ‘about £318,500’, according to the BBC. Adding VAT makes it £382,200. There has been no breakdown of how much each party was paid, but the £382,200 was split between Ms Rose and Change Associates. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said she was ‘surprised that the BBC appears to have learned no lessons from past mistakes about lack of transparency’. Andy Silvester of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, which campaigns for lower taxes, said: ‘The BBC can’t be allowed to bury these costs.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Work to implement the review’s findings will continue but no further costs will be incurred.’","Mark Sandell, 53, was sacked as editor of BBC radio's World Have Your Say .

Maruse Heath, seen here giving the middle finger to the camera, is a leader in the New Black Panther Party who was arrested in New York City for possession of an unlicensed, loaded handgun . At his arraignment Heath’s lawyer claimed that his client . was ‘jumped’ by the police in Harlem after leaving a meeting to plan the group’s 15th . Anniversary Million Man March commemoration in September, according . to The New York Post. ‘I don’t believe there’s any justification for the stop,’ Heath’s . lawyer Brad Foster said. The cops stopped Heath at night because he was allegedly wearing a bullet proof vest, but Foster argued they couldn’t have seen what his client was wearing in the dark. In addition to his 'Kill Whitey' tattoo, Heath has multiple tattoo on his face referencing black power groups and associated phrases . In these pictures Heath shows off his black pride tattoos including one on his lower right cheek that reads 'Freeborn,' presumably referring to African Americans former enslavement . Heath's entire face is covered in 'black power' tattoos including one not pictured here which reads 'Kill Whitey' described by Urban Dictionary as a phrase yelled to intimidate white prisoners in prison . ‘It’s very dark, 10:30 at night,' Foster said. 'They grabbed him by the shoulders . and cuffed him and he was in custody.’ However, Assistant District Attorney Christopher Ryan argued . that the size-52 ballistic vest Heath was wearing was easy to see in the dark. ‘A 52, sized as regular men’s clothing, is clearly obvious,’ the prosecutor said. During Heath's (seen here wearing a Black Panthers beret and holding a riffle) arraignment, the prosecutor referred to the New Black Panther Party as 'the functional equivalent of the KKK' If convicted Heath faces a minimum of three and a half years . for gun possession. He is currently being held on $75,000 bail. Ryan also brought into question Heath’s involvement in the . New Black Panther Group. ‘It is my understanding that the New Black Panther . Party is the functional equivalent of the KKK,’ he said. ‘It is no crime to belong to the Black Panther Party,’ Heath’s . lawyer countered, according to the newspaper. ‘The group does, ‘charity work . within the local community, outreach to the homeless, and works with at-risk . youth who are at risk of becoming criminals.’’ A militant member of the New Black Panther Party, Heath is the head of the organizations Philadelphia chapter. He was arrested in New York after leaving a group meeting wearing a bullet proof vest . At his arraignment Heath's (pictured left) lawyer told the court that the New Black Panther party is not a violent group, but instead is a vehicle for community service . In addition to his involvement in the group, Heath’s . ‘Kill Whitey’ tattoo also suggests something violent in his character. According to Urban Dictionary, Heath’s aggressive and . distinctive tattoo is ‘What is loudly shouted by white prisoners in mock style . of black inmates’ or ‘What Anarchist[s] say when opposing the man.’ Both definitions demonstrate that the epithet is meant as an . intimation tactic towards Caucasians. Heath's lawyer argued that his client (pictured here) was wrongly stopped by police who couldn't have seen that he was wearing a bullet proof vest in the dark . Heath has also been videotaped spewing violent comments at a festival celebrating African Heritage, 'You want freedom you gonna have to kill some crackers. You gonna have to kill some of they babies. Let us get our act together. It's time to wake up, clean up, and stand up.' This is not Heath’s first encounter with the law due to his involvement with the New Black Panther Party.

"A convicted killer who died on death row in 2011 was responsible for more than 100 murders including those of JonBenet Ramsey and Jimmy Hoffa, a new book claims. Retired cold case detective John Cameron, who helped bring suspects to trial in several murder cases, claims that Edward Wayne Edwards was also the Zodiac Killer and the Black Dahlia killer. The astonishing claims are detailed in Cameron's new book, 'It's Me: Edward Wayne Edwards, the Serial Killer You Never Heard Of'. Cameron says his investigations pin scores of murders to Edwards, who, in 2010, confessed to five killings dating back to 1977. These included his foster son, whom he killed for his $25,000 life insurance. Serial killer: Edward Wayne Edwards, pictured left in a mug shot and right after he married and had a family, confessed to five killings in 2010 - but now a detective has claimed he was responsible for many more . Murderer: Edwards, left, pictured in 2010, was sentenced to death but died of natural causes in 2011 . He was sentenced to death but he passed away, aged 77, of natural causes just a month before he was to be executed. Cameron worked for the Great Falls police force in Montana for 24 years, including 14 years specializing in cold case investigations, before retiring in 2005. He went to work for the Montana Parole Board and when Edwards confessed to the killings in 2010, he realized there was a link between two of the murders and an unsolved murder in Great Falls, the Great Falls Tribune reported. Edwards had confessed to killing a teenage couple who disappeared from a wedding reception in Wisconsin in 1980, where Edwards worked, and an Ohio couple in 1977. The nature . of the killings - shooting the lovers in the back of their heads - was . similar to the unsolved killings of Patricia Kalitzke, 16, and Lloyd . Bogle, 18, in 1956, Cameron thought. Bogle . was found bound up and shot in the back of the head in his car in a . lovers lane, while Kalitzke's body was found miles away, also shot. Author: Retired cold case detective John Cameron, pictured, investigated the case for four years . Cameron looked into the case and found that Deer Lodge Prison records indicated Edwards had arrived in Great Falls in January 1956 before he was arrested for a robbery that March. 'You have an admitted serial killer who was in town on the day that we have a double murder of a couple on lover’s lane in 1956,' Cameron told the Tribune. 'That's the evidence I have.' DNA evidence from Kalitzke's body does not match Edwards', but Cameron said that he believed the sample had been contaminated. Instead, he . has pushed on with connecting the killer to unsolved cases - as well as . cases that have been solved. In these, he believes the wrong person is . serving time in prison. 'I . was able to place him in Great Falls at the time of the murder, and . from there it’s spiraled into following his life,' he said. Cameron . began reading a memoir written by Edwards in 1972 called 'Metamorphosis . of a Criminal', and claims his whereabouts throughout that time place . him near to the scenes of murders. Victims? Cameron noticed that the crimes he confessed to bore similarities to the unsolved murders of Patricia Kalitzke and Lloyd Bogle, pictured, in 1956 and started investigating further possible connections . 'The Great Falls murder was in there, and once I determined . that, I decided to follow the whole book and see where else he killed, . and it unraveled the worst serial killer that's ever been,' he told KRTV. 'It got to the point where it never stopped, and it just leading me and leading me.' Cameron quit his parole board job to pursue the investigation and traveled across the country to interview Edwards' family members. From his . four-year investigation, he concluded that Edwards is responsible for . more than 100 deaths - which would make him the most prolific American . serial killer of the last century, if true. Cameron . also believes Edwards is responsible for deaths linked to the Zodiac . Killer during the 1960s and 1970s in northern California. He . adds that Edwards is responsible for the killings of child beauty queen . JonBenet Ramsey in Boulder, Colorado in 1996 and union leader Jimmy . Hoffa, who vanished in 1975 aged 62. Did he kill them? Cameron claims he also killed child beauty pageant star JonBenet Ramsey, left, who was killed in Colorado in 1996, and Jimmy Hoffa, right, who vanished from Detroit in 1975 . Murdered: Cameron also says he was responsible for the murder of the Zodiac Killer in northern California in the 1960s and 1970s, including victims Betty Lou Jensen (left) and Darlene Ferrin (right) On his website, Cameron claims that 'Edwards had been killing children his entire life' and in Ramsey's case, he left behind a false ransom note as he had been doing for years. 'The JonBenet ransom note was a parable of Edwards' life of killing,' he explained. Cameron also explains that in 1978, Edwards was interviewed by FBI agents about the murder of Hoffa and he fled shortly afterwards . Cameron said he knows some people do not believe his version of events. 'I didn't allow things to come in unless the evidence really was there,' he said. 'As it played out, it got worse and worse and worse.'","John Cameron, a retired cold case detective in Montana, believes confessed killer Edward Wayne Edwards killed more than 100 people .

"Chinese officials used a presidential visit to smuggle ivory out of Tanzania, an environmental watchdog has said. Diplomats and businessmen bought so much illegal ivory during the visit by President Xi Jinping in 2013 that local prices doubled, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) found. Ivory is a highly prized status symbol in China, which is the biggest importer of smuggled tusks. Tanzania is the largest source of poached ivory. Chinese-led criminal gangs conspired with corrupt Tanzanian officials to traffic thousands of kilos of ivory, some of which was loaded in diplomatic bags on Xi's plane during the presidential visit, the EIA report said. Chinese-led criminal gangs conspired with corrupt Tanzanian officials to traffic thousands of kilos of ivory . The illicit trade began to explode in China in 2008, when Beijing was permitted to purchase 62 tons of ivory under the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species. The purchase was presented as a way to keep alive China's traditional artisan ivory carving industry. A state-owned enterprise was authorized to sell the legal ivory to about 200 licensed factories and vendors. But, after legal pieces started showing up in shops, ivory soon became a status symbol in China. Diplomats and businessmen bought so much illegal ivory during the visit by President Xi Jinping in 2013 that local prices doubled . Carved ivory has historically been highly prized in China, and its scarcity has turned it into an investment choice akin to gold and silver. Critics say the legal stockpile of ivory has provided a convenient cover for a thriving black market in recent years. Although there have been efforts in Beijing to end the illegal trade, the licensing system in China is flawed and enforcement is lax, said Grace Ge Gabriel, Asian regional director for International Fund for Animal Welfare.","Chinese officials used a presidential visit to smuggle ivory out of Tanzania, which is the largest source of poached ivory .

The landmark, which is equivalent to a 50-storey building, cost nearly £10 million and has been designed by the same architect behind the Oriental Pearl TV Tower in Shanghai. According to Fushun Municipal Government's officials, the iconic structure has been built simply to serve as an viewing platform. Up to four elevators will take visitors to the top. The developer originally planned to add a platform for visitors to bungee jump off. However, the idea was abandoned because the ring is too high for bungee jumpers. A local construction bureau official told the Shenyang Evening News that Fushun wanted to have an office tower on the spot of the ring but the town was too small to support it. The Ring of Life came to fruition after the developer scrapped three other plans.

"She may be one of South America's finest exports, but Luisana Lopilato has decided that when it comes to the 2012 Olympic Games her loyalties belong firmly with the Brits. The Argentinian model wife of singer Michael Buble has shown her support for Team GB by appearing in a set of British-themed sports lingerie pictures for UK underwear label Ultimo. Let the Games begin: Michael Buble's model wife Luisana Lopilato models Ultimo's new Union Jack-themed sports lingerie . Eagle eyed readers will notice that there's something a little unreal about the pictures, and not just the blonde's incredible figure. Ultimo have confirmed that the Union Jack flags have been added with a bit of computer wizadry. But any friend of Team GB's is a friend of ours, and it would be a crime not to share Luisana's enthusiasm for our national team. And the brand promise to put the set in to production if there's enough demand. Michelle Mone OBE said: 'We’re . proud to be a British brand and will be cheering on Team GB all the way . in the London Olympics. 'Luisana looks phenomenal in the shots; she . loves sport and keeping fit so this look really suits her! I’m sure if . posing in lingerie were an Olympic sport Luisana would win gold.' Swapping teams: She may be Argentinian, but that won't stop model Luisana Lopilato showing her Olympic support for Team GB in Ultimo's new sports lingerie . Flaunting her size eight figure and 34D bust in the shots Lopilato proves why she was chosen as the latest 'face and . body' of the brand. The 24-year-old is the first to admit it takes . hard work and Olympic dedication to maintain her gold-standard frame. She says: 'I work out . everyday. I run for at least 30 minutes and play tennis. It's important . for me to be fit and healthy.' Lopilato has certainly been pulling her weight at Ultimo since joining the brand. Barely a week goes by without her appearing in one of their new creations, and she was recently seen modelling the brand's stunning new diamante line, and a set of Oriental-inspired gel-fitted bras and girly briefs, available in both fuschia pink and black. The model, who is a successful actress in . her home country of Argentina, signed up as the face of Ultimo for a . two-year stint in October last year. Since . then, sales have rocketed by 37 per cent - a spike that Ultimo founder . and CEO Michelle Mone attributes in part to the Lopilato effect. A model employee: Model Luisana Lopilato has been pulling her weight at Ultimo since joining the brand, appearing in a new set of underwear almost weekly . Uliitmo founder Michelle Mone says: 'Michael Buble¿s wife Luisana is one of our biggest international stars, and the response we have had has been phenomenal' When Michelle Mone was awarded an OBE . in 2010 for her services to business, she gave thanks to Luisana and . the other Ultimo models, including Tamara Ecclestone and Amy Childs, who both modelled . for the brand in 2011. And when she promised that 2012 would be even bigger, she was not wrong. At the time, she said: 'This year we . have unveiled some amazing images designed to best showcase our . collections and it has been fantastic to be involved with some . incredible women. 'Michael Buble’s wife Luisana is one of our biggest international stars, . and the response we have had has been phenomenal. 'It . took me a long time to get her but I refused to give up.

"Under pressure: Ed Miliband's Labour has received more than £18million in ¿soft loans¿ from the Co-op Bank . Labour has received more than £18million in ‘soft loans’ from the Co-op Bank – which is to be the subject of an independent inquiry ordered by Chancellor George Osborne. Documents lodged with the Electoral Commission reveal the Co-op has been propping up the Labour Party for years with a string of generous loans and overdraft facilities at rock-bottom rates. The party is facing acute embarrassment over its links with the troubled lender, which David Cameron told the Commons had been ‘driven into the wall’ by its disgraced former boss Reverend Paul Flowers. The Co-op is seeking a £1.5billion . recapitalisation after being plunged into crisis thanks largely to bad . loans associated with its takeover of Britannia Building Society in . 2009. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today called Flowers' rise to the top of the Co-op Bank 'extremely murky'. 'I'm sure the Labour Party will want to both account for itself but also make sure that, in addition to all the question marks that still exist about the way in which they act almost as puppets on the end of a string for the trade union bosses, that they are not also in hock to some slightly off characters at this bank,' he toldLBC 97.3. The Prime Minister told the Commons the debacle needed to be investigated thoroughly. The Government’s first priority was to safeguard the Co-op Bank and ensure customers and bondholders were protected, he said, but he raised a series of questions about Flowers’s suitability for a top banking job and his links with Labour. Government sources said an inquiry was likely to be ordered within days by the Prudential Regulation Authority, under powers Mr Osborne obtained in the 2012 Financial Services Act. A separate investigation could be launched by the Financial Conduct Authority into whether the bank broke City rules. Links: Labour is facing acute embarrassment over its links with the troubled lender, which David Cameron, left, told the Commons had been ‘driven into the wall’ by its disgraced former boss Reverend Paul Flowers, right . The £18million in Co-op loans to Labour include £4million over seven years in 1999 at an interest rate of 6.8 per cent, £2million in 2007 for five months at 2 per cent above base rate, a £2million ‘emergency overdraft’ in 2009 at 5 per cent above base rate, and £1.2million over six months in 2006 at  2 per cent above base rate. Labour’s latest Co-op loan, worth £1.2million, was doled out in March this year, just weeks after Ed Miliband invited Flowers to his Commons office for private talks. The Co-op’s sister organisation, the Unity Trust Bank, lent Labour an identical sum on the same day. Both loans were arranged at an interest rate of just 4 per cent – far lower than the Co-op offers to its own loyal customers – and were made despite Labour’s poor credit history. Tory MP Brooks Newmark said the scandal surrounding Flowers, a former Labour councillor, had ‘peeled back an unhealthy and poisonous relationship between Labour and the Co-op Bank’. Mr Brooks, a member of the Commons Treasury committee, said the revelations raised disturbing questions about whether Labour was turning a blind eye to disastrous governance at the bank. He added: ‘Given its dire financial circumstances the Labour Party would normally struggle to get loans from anyone other than Wonga. 'But because of its cosy relationship, which means Labour has been able to place councillors and members in key positions at the Co-op Bank, it has continued to have access to these extraordinary soft loans. ‘Ordinary customers of the Co-op Bank and shoppers at Co-op stores will be astonished that their money is being used to make huge donations and loans at very soft rates to Ed Balls and Labour.’ Mr Miliband has attempted to distance himself from Flowers in recent days, after the Methodist preacher was filmed buying hard drugs, including crack cocaine and crystal meth. But details have emerged of a cosy relationship between the two men. Mr Miliband and shadow chancellor Mr Balls hosted a Downing Street reception for Flowers and other Co-op grandees in 2010. Probe: The Co-op bank is set to be subject of an independent inquiry ordered by Chancellor George Osborne . The Labour leader then went on to appoint him to his elite Business and Industry Advisory Board. Mr Miliband also held a secretive meeting in the Commons with Flowers on March 6 this year. Three weeks later the Co-Op Bank approved the £1.2million loan to Labour. In the Commons, Mr Cameron suggested Labour knew about Flowers’s ‘past’, before the drugs and porn claims emerged. He said: ‘Why was Reverend Flowers judged suitable to be chairman of a bank? Why weren’t alarm bells rung earlier, particularly by those who knew?’ The Prime Minister said Mr Osborne was ‘discussing with the regulator what is the appropriate form of inquiry’. Troubled: The Co-op is seeking a £1.5billion recapitalisation after being plunged into crisis thanks largely to bad loans associated with its takeover of Britannia Building Society in 2009 . He told Mr Miliband: ‘What we can now see is this bank – driven into the wall by this chairman – has been giving soft loans to the Labour Party, facilities to the Labour Party, donations to the Labour Party, trooped in and out of Downing Street under Labour, still advising you, and yet now we know all along they [Labour} knew about his past. ‘Why did they do nothing to bring to the attention of the authorities this man who has broken a bank?’ Mr Miliband told Mr Cameron: ‘You’ve taken millions from tax exiles and tax avoiders, your party has never paid back the money from Asil Nadir – and they’re just the people I can talk about in this House.’ Treasury Select Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: ‘The Treasury Committee strongly recommends that any review into the Co-op Bank be conducted by an independent person. 'The authorities cannot be seen to be marking their own work.’","Documents lodged with the Electoral Commission reveal generous loans .

"Australian jihadist Khaled Sharrouf has warned of a terrorist attack on home soil just days after the Australian Federal Police issued a warrant for his arrest. Sharrouf, from Sydney, escaped authorities in December by using his brother Mustafa's passport to go and fight in Syria and Iraq with al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State. He said in a letter to Fairfax Media this week that he would have carried out an attack on Australia if he hadn't left when he did. Khaled Sharrouf sent Fairfax Media a letter from Iraq after federal police issued a warrant for his arrest . Arrest warrants were issued for Sharrouf and fellow Sydney-man Mohamed Elomar after Daily Mail Australia revealed a disturbing photo of Elomar holding up two decapitated heads for the camera in Syria. The picture was uploaded on Twitter on Friday by convicted terrorist Sharrouf. The 31-year-old demanded the release of 12 Muslim prisoners in the letter. One of the men who he called for the release of was Hyde Park rioter Ahmed Elomar. Ahmed is the brother of Mohamed Elomar - the man Sharrouf is fighting with in the Middle East. The 31-year-old demanded the release of 12 Muslim prisoners in Australia in the letter . Ahmed and Mohamed used to be champion boxers in their early twenties before they became radicalised in Sydney. Ahmed was jailed in June for two and a half years for bashing a police officer in the Hyde Park Islamic march of 2012. Sharrouf also claimed in his letter that he toyed with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and police while he was under surveillance. He wrote that he had been inspired to join the jihad because of the West's 'murderous' activities. Sharrouf previously spent time in an Australian jail for his part in a foiled plot to blow up targets in Sydney and Melbourne. Scroll down for video . Disgusting: Mohamed Elomar, who is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria, is shown holding up the decapitated heads of two men . In a sickening image that Sharrouf posted on Twitter last week, Mohamed Elomar is seen smiling - with a pair of sunglasses tucked into his shirt - as he holds up two decapitated heads by the victims' hair. Another image, uploaded on Friday, shows the heads of alleged Syrian solders being impaled on metal railings. Like something out of the 18th century, the heads were left on show in a sickening display that aims to cause terror and fear. The photos were uploaded by Sharrouf, alongside disgusting tweets such as 'bucket full of heads any1 in aus want some organs please dont be shy to ask I would love to assist u with body parts [sic]'. Disturbing: Sharrouf also posted a photo of two men placing severed heads on a metal railing . Khaled Sharrouf posted the photos on Twitter alongside captions such as 'this guy lost his head!!! Lol' The convicted terrorist said he wanted to cut 'infidel throats' He directed his tweets to people in Australia and joked about organ donation . His disturbing rant continued 'few more heads how lovely bludy amazing stuff abuhafs u keep cutting those infidel throats but the last 1 is mine! [sic]' The tweets came as the nation's Director General of Security David Irvine revealed 'tens of people' had already returned to Australian shores from fighting alongside suspected terrorist organisations. Speaking to media earlier this month, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'. 'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said. Mr Irvine added a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots. 'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said. When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'. On July 14, Sharrouf fired off a tweet to the AFP and Australians, saying: 'you cowards I am running to my death I want martyrdom thats [sic] why I am blessed u rock spiders'. Just half an hour earlier, he claimed 'Australia belongs to the muslims not infidels like you' as well as boasting of his evasion of police. 'u can't stop and trust me if I wanted to attack aus I could have easily,' Sharrouf said. He also added: 'I love to slaughter [Australians] & ALLAH LOVEs when u dogs r slaughtered'. These threatening tweets are part of a more disturbing picture of Sharrouf painted by his Twitter account.

'I often enter the majority of the 40 or so flower classes but this year I would be hard pressed to enter six classes and it seems most of our members are having the same problem.'

Yesterday saw contrasts across the British Isles, with the warmest temperatures at Helen's Bay in Northern Ireland where it was 10C, and 8C on the Isle of Skye. But it was 0C in Wych Cross, Sussex, and Kenley, Surrey. Last April the northern half of the UK saw up to 25cm of snow. The snowiest April on record was in 1981 when between 50cm and 60cm fell across the Forest of Dean and Gloucestershire. More than 5,000 Britons could have died last month because of the freezing weather, it was feared today. New figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that, in the first three weeks of last month, 4,206 more deaths than usual were recorded. A further 1,000 extra deaths are expected to have been recorded for the final week of the month - lifting the March total to 5,000 more than normal. It is believed that the freezing temperatures and snow could be partly to blame for these extra deaths - which were mainly among older people. A rise in flu cases could also be partly responsible. The overall death toll in the first three weeks of March was 33,500, compared with a previous average of 29,294 for the past five years. A Department of Health spokeswoman said the full details about cold weather deaths would not be made available by the Government until October - giving statisticians time to make a detailed study. She said : 'We are concerned to see an increase in deaths, but these figures are provisional and should be treated with caution.' She added that an extra £330million had been made available this winter for the NHS and social care. The greatest rise in deaths came during the third week of March when the death toll was 1,600 higher than normal at 11,075. Shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said: 'When winter weather bites, we have all got a responsibility to look in on older neighbours and relatives. 'Older people need to keep warm but soaring gas and electricity prices are making this harder than it should be.' Mr Gwynne said that social services were struggling after more than £1.3billion was cut from town hall budgets for care of the elderly. He said: 'Families are being left without adequate support for their loved ones. Ministers need to make sure that older people are getting the care they need.'","Sleet and snow fell over London and South East yesterday .

"A teenager has spoken of her 'total shock' at being told at the age of 17 she had no vagina. Jacqui Beck, 19, has MRKH, an rare syndrome which affects the reproductive system - meaning she has no womb, cervix or vaginal opening. She was only diagnosed after she went to her GP about back pain - and mentioned in passing that she hadn't started her periods. Shock: Jacqui Beck was told at the age of 17 she had no vagina. She was diagnosed with MRKH, an unusual syndrome which affects the reproductive system - meaning she has no womb, cervix or vaginal opening . Tests revealed her condition and that where her vagina should be, there is simply an ident, or 'dimple' - meaning she is unable to have sex or carry her own child. Women with the condition appear completely normal externally - which means it is usually not discovered until a woman tries to have sex, or has not had her first period. Miss Beck, from the Isle of Wight, admits when she was first diagnosed, she felt 'like a freak'. 'I'd never considered myself different from other women and the news was so shocking, I couldn't believe what I was . hearing. ‘I . was sure the doctor had got it wrong, but when she explained that . was why I wasn’t having periods, it all started to make sense. ‘She then explained that I would never be able . to carry a child and might have to have surgery before I could have sex. ‘I left the doctors in tears - I . would never know what it was like to give birth, be pregnant, have a . period. All the things I had imagined doing suddenly got erased from my . future. 'I was really angry and felt like I wasn’t a real woman any more.' Unaware: Miss Beck explained she has a 'dimple' where her vagina should be so from the outside it looks normal - hence why the condition wasn't detected in her younger years . Unexpected: Miss Beck was only diagnosed after she went to her GP about back pain - and mentioned in passing that she hadn't started her periods. Tests revealed her condition, which means she is unable to have sex or carry her own child . Because she had never attempted to have a physical relationship, Miss Beck had never noticed the problem herself.  Had she tried, she would have discovered it was . impossible for her to have sex. MRKH (Mayer Rokitansky Küster Hauser) is a congenital abnormality which affects one in 5,000 women in . the UK. It is characterised by the absence of the vagina, womb  and . cervix. Women suffering from the condition will have normally functioning ovaries and so will experience the normal signs of puberty but will not have periods or be able to conceive. The external genatalia are completely normal which is why MRKH isn’t usually discovered until women are in their teenage years. It’s usually discovered when the woman tries to has sex or fails to get her period. Many women are able to create a vaginal canal using dilation treatment, which uses cylinder shaped dilators of different sizes to stretch the muscles. However, if this is unsuccessful then surgery will be used to stretch the vaginal canal. Following treatment women are able to have intercourse and can have their eggs removed and fertilised to be used in surrogacy. She said: 'It . wasn’t really a conscious decision not to have a boyfriend, I just . didn’t really fancy any of the boys in my area, which is lucky, . considering what I know now’. MRKH affects one in 5,000 women in the UK. Most discover they have the condition because they haven't started their periods, but some find out when they struggle to have intercourse. Miss Beck explained she has a 'dimple' where her vagina should be so from the outside it looks normal - which explains why the condition wasn't detected earlier. Despite the shocking news, she is trying to see her condition in a positive light - and even as a way of making sure she meets the right man. She said: 'If he has a problem with it, then he’s not the kind of . guy I want to go out with. 'I’m . a hopeless romantic and I see it as a great test of someone’s . character. Instead of focusing on it putting off men,  I actually think it . will help me find, “the one”. 'I want to be upfront with . any men I meet and tell them straight away about my condition. I don’t . want them to feel tricked into being with me. ‘I . will feel more comfortable if they know the truth and besides, if they . run at the mention of MRKH then I don’t want to be intimate with them.' She says that as a teenager, she was blissfully unaware of her condition - with no idea that the development she was waiting for would never happen. 'When I was 14, my friends . started talking to me about their periods. They started carrying tampons . around, complaining about cramps and sharing notes on what it was like. ‘For a year I waited to go through the same, until at 15, everyone I knew had started their period apart from me. Despite the shocking news, she is trying to see . her condition in a positive light - and even as a way of making sure she . meets the right man. She said: 'If he has a problem with it, then he’s . not the kind of guy I want to see' ‘I didn’t panic though, I’m tall and skinny and thought that might be something to do with me being a late developer.’ Instead, she focused on her future . and when she was 17, applied to attend a music college in . Guildford. But after suffering from pain in her neck in summer 2012, she went to see her GP. 'While I was there, I mentioned I hadn’t started my period yet. I still wasn’t overly worried . but I thought it was worth saying something . ‘My . doctor was very surprised but didn’t seem to think it was serious. He . just suggested that he would do some scans to see what the problem was.' Hindsight: Miss Beck says that as a teenager, she was blissfully unaware of her condition - with no idea that the development she was waiting for would never happen . Women with MRKH appear completely normal externally - which means it is often not discovered in childhood, but in the teenage years . When scans showed nothing, she was referred to a gynaecologist, who immediately spotted something was wrong. Miss Beck said: ‘My other scan results had been sent to her and just from looking at them, she knew I had MRKH. ‘She . sat me down and basically explained that I didn’t have a womb, or a . vagina, that I was born without them and instead just had a small dimple . in it’s place.' So mortified by what she had heard, she was too embarrassed to admit to family and friends she had the condition - let alone the prospect of telling . any future boyfriends. She said: ‘I . was too embarrassed to call my mum and talk it through with her, so . instead, I sent her an email. YouTube Jacqui Beck . Help: Miss Beck is now undergoing treatment to help her try and have intercourse in the future . 'She called straight back and came over to . Guildford the next day from the Isle of Wight. ‘Although . mum was upset for me, she tried to focus on finding out as much about . the condition as possible, so we could understand it. ‘She . also encouraged me to focus on the bright side. We laughed as we listed . all the things I wouldn’t have to go through, period cramps, . childbirth, smear tests - to try and look on the bright side.’ Focusing on her treatment, Miss Beck was . admitted to the Queen Charlotte and Chelsea Hospital in London, which . specialises in the condition. There, she was given dilation treatment, which . involved using different sized dilators to try and stretch her vaginal . canal - but was told if it didn’t work, she would have to be operated on. Honest: Miss Beck says she now wants to speak out about her condition to raise awareness of it . She said: ‘I spent two days there, getting taught how to use the dilator and learning more about MRKH. ‘The first time the nurse showed me how to use a dilator I nearly died of embarrassment. But now I've got used to it, I see it as any other form of treatment. ‘At the hospital, they referred me to a network of other women who have the same condition. It was great to speak to other girls who felt like me. ‘I stopped feeling so lonely and it also gave me hope as I spoke to women who had gone on to have a full sex life.’ Thankfully, her treatment has worked and if she continues she will not need surgery and when she chooses to, will be able to have intercourse. Further down the line there are more difficult conversations she will have to have to have when she wants to have children. She said: ‘I’m not at an age when I’m thinking about kids, but I think that will hit me later on. I will use a surrogate, or adopt, but I will have to make sure any guy I meet is ok with that too. ‘Again, I try and take it as a blessing that, unlike woman who discover they can’t conceive when they are already trying for a baby, I have time to get used to the idea.’ For Miss Beck, her one hope is that the condition becomes more well known, so that other women realise they have it earlier than she did. ‘I had only told five of my best friends, but then I realised it’s not something I should be ashamed of. ‘If I had cancer, or, any other medical issue, people would be supportive. So, I recently came out to everyone on Facebook, telling them about my condition. ‘I was surprised at how positive everyone was, they said I was brave and beautiful, now I wish I had been open about it from the beginning.’","Jacqui Beck was diagnosed after telling her GP she had not started periods .

"The first of nine abandoned puppies named after characters from Downton Abbey has been adopted - by massive fans of the TV drama. Josephine Smedley, her two daughters and her two-year-old grandson Ilias made the seven-hour, 330-mile round trip to collect Martha. The family of Downton Abbey fans were looking to adopt a lurcher puppy as a companion for their eight-year-old lurcher Meg. Scroll down for video of the puppies... Two-year-old Ilias holds his new puppy, Martha. His grandmother Josephine Smedley was the first person to collect one of nine abandoned lurcher puppies named after Downton Abbey characters . Abby Smedley (left) said she tried to contact Shirley Maclaine who played Martha, the namesake of their new puppy. (Pictured l-r Abby, Josephine Smedley, Carla Edwards and two-year-old Ilias Edwards) After hearing about the litter of abandoned puppies, Mrs Smedley and her husband Andy travelled to Southampton from their home in Toton, Nottingam, to collect their new pet. Mother-of-four Mrs Smedley, 49, said: 'Of course we watch Downton Abbey - our family love all costume dramas. 'It’s a family ritual on Sunday evenings and we’ll all be gathering around the television this weekend to watch the show. 'I’m sure Martha will be watching her namesake in action.' Her daughter Abby, 19, said the couple tried to contact Shirley Maclaine, who plays Martha Levinson in Downton. She said: 'We even tried to contact the actress over Twitter but, sadly, we couldn’t find her anywhere.' Martha Levinson is the mother of Cora, Countess of Grantham, and appeared in the second series of the award-winning drama. The character caused a stir when she arrived at the stately home for the wedding of Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley. She and the Dowager Countess regularly locked horns and Mrs Levinson was known for her strong opinions on the traditional aristocratic household. The Smedley family’s application was one of 60 for the nine puppies which Southampton’s Blue Cross Rehoming Centre has received in the past week. Martha the puppy was named after Downton character Martha Levinson, played by Shirley Maclaine (right) The litter was originally discovered abandoned and crying in a cardboard box in a park in Southampton, Hants, last Tuesday. A woman out walking her dogs was shocked to discover the pups inside and brought them to the centre. Staff there chose to name them all after Downton Abbey characters in the hope it would be popular with potential owners. But they were shocked to receive an unprecedented amount of applications in just a week. Mrs Smedley said: 'I liked the name Martha and we thought it went nicely with Meg. 'She looks exactly the same as Meg when we collected her from a rescue centre eight years ago and everyone will think they are mother and daughter. 'We have been looking to adopt a lurcher puppy for a while because we love their temperament. 'They’re loving, laid back dogs and they get on really well with kids. After we saw their picture in the paper we thought ‘yes, this is for us’. The nine lurcher puppies were named after the Downton cast to help them find new homes . The puppies were found abandoned in a cardboard box but have been nursed back to health . 'We went out yesterday and bought her this great big bed which I know she’ll love.' Rehoming supervisor Laura Boyle revealed that all the pups have now been reserved and will be going to their new homes in the coming weeks. Ms Boyle said: 'It’s been an amazing response and many Downton fans have been in contact over Twitter following our news about the puppies. The litter of puppies are called Earl and Cora, after the Earl and Countess of Grantham; Jim Carter's Carson; Laura Carmichael's Edith; Allen Leech's Tom and Sophie McShera's Daisy. Ed Speelers' Jimmy and Matt Milne's Alfred are also represented. 'Over the weekend we had a lot of people come in and if they hadn’t reserved one they weren’t able to get in. 'It’s just been amazing. I haven’t even mentioned the phone calls we’ve had from people who enquired about their health to see how they’re getting on. 'Many of them even contributed to the charity too. We’ve never had so many applications in such a short space of time. 'Of them all, every customer liked Carson because he’s the confident one out of the litter.'","Josephine Smedley's family are the first to collect their new lurcher puppy .

"Pigs have been blown up, guinea pigs poisoned and marmosets given anthrax in germ and chemical warfare experiments at the top secret British military research base, it has emerged. The campaign group that uncovered the details of the 'cruel and grotesque' research projects by scientists at the Porton Down labs in Wiltshire said that in some cases it appeared the animals had been given nothing to ease their pain. Many of the experiments involved substantial suffering and led to the death of the animals, the British Union for Abolition of Vivisection's investigation found. Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock said he was shocked by the number of animal experiments being carried out at Porton Down in Wiltshire every year . The charity's chief executive Michelle Thew said: 'Although supporting the need to ensure the safety of soldiers and civilians in an increasingly dangerous world, the BUAV is opposed to deliberately causing suffering and death to animals in such disturbing and cruel experiments. 'We believe it is totally unacceptable to treat animals in this way.' The Ministry of Defence, which last week was forced to explain experiments in which pigs are shot for military surgeons to operate on, said animal research is vital if it is to protect Britain and members of the Armed Forces safe. The BUAV highlighted six pieces of studies published in medical and scientific journals since 2010. Some were funded by, or carried out in collaboration with, US defence agencies. In one of the most graphic experiments, pigs were blown up by bombs before being resuscitated. The researchers wanted to find out the best way to treat soldiers when there is a delay in evacuating them from the battlefield. Highly dangerous bacteria and biological weapons were tested on marmosets, like the one pictured above . Campaigners say the military research on animals such as pigs is 'gruesome' and any evidence it saves lives is 'questionable' The animals were anesthetised and placed on trolleys eight feet away from explosives that were then detonated remotely. They were then drained of a third of their blood before being resuscitated. Eleven of the 28 animals died, despite the researchers' efforts. The researchers later wrote that the information they obtained will be of profound significance when treating wounded soldiers in the field. Two other pig studies involved the animals being forced to inhale chemical warfare agents, including mustard gas. In research into anthrax, marmosets were infected with the highly dangerous bacterium which can be used as a biological weapon. Four died and those that were still alive at the end of the experiment were killed and dissected. The BUAV was unable to find any evidence that monkeys were given any sort of pain relief. A fifth experiment involved testing a treatment for VX, a nerve agent and chemical weapon that causes fits, breathing difficulties, coma and eventually death. The poison was applied to the animals' shaved backs before the treatment was injected into their muscles. Eight died within the first two days and dissection revealed their guts had twisted. Finally, scientists reaching a vaccine against bubonic plague injected mice with the bug behind the devastating disease. Dr Katy Taylor, the BUAV's senior scientific advisor, said: 'In addition to the ethical objections of using animals in such severe experiments, it is questionable that this type of research actually saves lives. This is because it is difficult to extrapolate findings from other animals to humans. 'Also, some of these experiments were attempting to replicate some of what we already know from human and other animal studies, which challenges the conviction that the high level of suffering inflicted upon these animals is justified.' An RSPCA spokesman said: 'Animals too often pay the price of man's inhumanity to man. The military should use and invest in alternative, non-animal training methods.' The Ministry of Defence's Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down said: 'DSTL is proud of the research undertaken by its staff and believes that the remit to provide safe and effective protective measures for the UK and its Armed Forces could not, currently, be achieved without the use of animals.' A spokesman added that international collaborations cut the need for the duplication of animal experiments and all work is approved by the Home Office, which also inspects the labs. 'All the research projects that involve animals are licensed by the Home Office. As part of the licensing process, the researchers have to convince the Home Office that the work is required, that the results cannot be obtained without the use of animals and that every step has been taken to minimise pain and suffering to the animals involved.'","Campaign group uncovered details of the 'cruel and grotesque' research projects at .

"Perfectly timed pictures of a startled stargazer fish, a mouse peering cautiously from underneath a sleeping lion's paw, and an orphaned monkey gazing vacantly as he hangs on a washing line have been shortlisted by the Natural History Museum Wildlife Photographer of the Year jury. They join a shot of a snow monkey playing with an iPhone taken by award- winning photographer Marsel van Oosten at hot springs in Jigokudani. It became the centre of controversy when Ashton Kutcher posted it on his Facebook page without a credit. Van Oosten accused the Hollywood star of ‘stealing’ the picture, and it was subsequently removed. Hanging out: This orphaned Central American spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) lives in the workers camp of the El Mirador archaeological site and was snapped as he clung to a washing line with a vacant stare in his eyes . Startled by a stargazer:  Photographer Jennifer Jo Stock met this chap on a 'muck dive' in Lembeh, Indonesia. She said: 'Having never seen this species of fish before I was truly shocked when the surrounding black sand was gently blown from it's eyes and teeth, revealing such a scary face' Sleeping lions: Whilst photographing lions in Kenya's Masai Mara, photographer, Juan Carlos Mimó Perez, noticed a tiny mouse resting calmly under the paw of one of the pride members . Monkeying around: This young Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) stole an iPhone off a tourist that wanted to take a closeup shot, but got way too close. The macaque was very pleased with the new toy though, and even managed to switch on the flashlight a few times. Needless to say the iPhone did not survive the underwater sessions . The picture, has now helped Mr van Oosten earn a nomination in the Natural History Museum’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. The picture of the macaque is one of 50 that have been shortlisted by the Wildlife Photographer of the Year jury. Members of the public are now being asked to vote for their favourite, with the voting closing on September 5 and the winner announced in October. Stretching:  With a big stretch, a young lioness gets ready to set off on a hunt with the rest of her pride in Kenya's Masai Mara . One eye on you:  After hearing that colleagues had seen elusive short-eared owls in the Al-Jahra Pool Reserve, Mohammed Khorshed spotted this one two days later sitting on a tree, perfectly positioned for a photo. Three hours of shooting resulted in this beautiful shot . The pictures feature a vast range of wildlife from a stretching lioness in Kenya, to a group of king penguins and fur seals huddling together in South Georgia. Other stunning images include a rescued rhino chewing on a man’s hand in a conservation reserve in Zimbabwe and kangaroos hoping around a waterhole in Sturt National Park in New South Wales, Australia. Hitching a lift:  After successfully hatching, this Great Crested Grebe chick relaxes on the back of the female in Viverone Lake in Italy.

"Allen and Company's Sun Valley Conference is called the 'summer camp for billionaires' and it lives up to the name. All manner of wizened political and business leaders are attending this year's event. Rupert Murdoch, the 82-year-old chairman and CEO of News Corp, has been pictured with both of his sons. Also in attendance are Berkshire Hathaway founder Warren Buffett, also 82 and ranked as the fourth richest man in the world; New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, 71; and Phil Knight, the 72-year-old founder of Nike.

Other notable figures include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, 36, Pinterest founder Ben Silbermann, 30, and YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar, 35. These new 'masters of the universe' seem to have a few things in common. They're coders by trade. They made their careers by writing computer programs and working on the technical side of Silicon Valley. They're all insanely rich. Zuckerberg has a $13.1billion fortune. Dorsey is worth $1.1billion. Kamangar was the sixth employee every hired at Google. And none of them seem to dress the part. Highly powerful and super rich - they prefer unassuming t-shirts and jeans to a suit and tie. Billions of dollars in wealth and hardly a collar in sight. Zuckerberg has famously led the way in this trend with his insistence on wearing a hooded sweatshirt - even to some powerful business meetings. He did not deviate from his fashion trend at Sun Valley, either. While his new wife Priscilla Chan looked lovely in a white blouse and scarf, Zuckerberg sported a black hoodie and jeans.

News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch and Microsoft founder Bill Gates were among the the older billionaires in attendance at Sun Valley . These old-media power players see Zuckerberg and social media leaders as the best way to market their movies and television shows in a world where more and more young people are getting their entertainment online. Other executives like YouTube's Kamangar and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, 52, are also in demands because they control the delivery methods for content. Tens of millions of users stream movies and shows online through Netflix and YouTube. Those companies, though, need to hammer out agreements with the content producers in order for their businesses to grow. Sun Valley, afterall, was founded as place where the world's most powerful men and women could gather to rub elbows - and hammer out major business deals.","Moguls of companies that produce TV shows and movies are looking to partner with Silicon Valley pioneers to deliver their content online .

"Every girl wants a gorgeously kissable plump pout, and whatever the size or shape of your lips, it's easier to achieve than you think. Everyone's been talking about Kylie Jenner's full-lipped look recently, which she puts down to 'clever make-up'. So this week I've enlisted the help of top make-up artist Buster Knight, who taught me a quick and easy way to fake fuller-looking lips, using a bit of cosmetic trickery. Here's how we did it: . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky shows you how to achieve Kylie Jenner's full pout with the help of make-up artist Buster Knight (right) STEP 1 – Prep Your Pout . There's no point having a plump pout if your lips are going to be dry and chapped. Keep your lips moisturised by using a good quality lip balm daily – my favourite is the French Pharmacy classic Nuxe Reve de Miel Lip Balm. It offers intensive moisture, keeping lips looking smooth and feeling ultra-hydrated – not to mention its utterly delectable honey scent! STEP 2 – Lined Lips . Firstly, take a lip pencil in a shade slightly warmer than your natural lip colour – I've gone for Clarins Lipliner Pencil in Bay Rose – and frame the outline of your lips to give them dimension and shape. Kylie Jenner revealed recently that her fuller looking lips were down to nothing more than 'clever make-up' Binky sees if she can achieve the same effect . Take the pencil just outside your natural lip line to create a trick of shadow, making your lip shape appear fuller. Once you're happy with the shape you've outlined, gently blend the pencil inwards into your lips with a small brush so the effect remains natural looking. Focus the lipliner on the outer corners of your lips to ensure the centre of your pout looks as full as possible. Feel free to reinforce the line with another layer of pencil after blending until you achieve the desired fullness. STEP 3 – Trick Of Light . Next, apply a very light pink-toned lip pencil – or a cream concealer such as bareMinerals Correcting Concealer in Light 1 – onto the central area of your upper and lower lips, making sure not to go over the lip line you've already applied. This sneaky trick creates the illusion of light and will make your pout look extra plump. Similarly, adding a touch of pearlescent highlighter such as Too Faced Candlelight Softly Illuminating Translucent Powder to your Cupid's bow will further accentuate your pout. STEP 4 – Add Lipstick . Lighter lip colours close to your natural lip shade tend to work better than darker hues when it comes to faking fuller lips – think peachy nudes, pinks and browns. Dior Rouge Dior Nude Lip Blush in Grege, Clarins Rouge Eclat Lipstick in Nude Rose and DHC Premium Lipstick in Petal Pink are three of my favourite lippy options for creating a plumped-up pout. Binky recommends using a concealer in order to create an illusion of light . Using a small lip brush, apply your chosen lip colour onto the lips. Blend the light concealer in the centre outwards slightly – without totally covering it – so it merges seamlessly into your lips. This should result in a natural looking yet gorgeously voluptuous pout! STEP 5 – Get Glossy . Finally, if you want to go all out, there's no better product to add volume to the lips than a plumping gloss. Givenchy Gloss Interdit Ultra-Shiny Plumping Effect Lipgloss in Impertinent Nude provides the perfect shimmering veil to complement your plumper pout, imparting spectacular shine while instantly adding volume to the lips with its expert plumping formulation. What's more, it doesn't leave your lips feeling sticky or gloopy like some glosses can – plus its fruity flavour will leave your pout feeling deliciously kissable as well as looking plumped-up to the max. All the products used to create my plump pout this week are available at Escentual.com. You can really have fun with these tips, trying out different products, shades and textures for a wealth of lip looks. Remember though, make-up exists to enhance the natural beauty you already have – so don't go overboard! Binky says that although you are trying to make your lips look bigger try not to go over board, enhance your natural features rather than get too carried away . BINKY'S BEST: DATE NIGHT LIP COLOURS .

"Parents who encourage their young children to take part in cage fighting contests could be jailed for child cruelty, legal experts warn. They face sentences of up to six months for allowing a boy or girl of primary school age to take part in the sport – described as  ‘barbaric’ by the Culture Secretary. And a Preston social club which hosted the boys’ fight reported in the Mail yesterday is to be investigated over whether it broke its licence conditions. The revelations come after a video emerged showing Kian MacKinson, nine, and a boy of eight, whose father has requested he remain anonymous, kicking, shoving and grappling in front of baying adults. The footage caused outrage among child and medical experts, who called for a police and social services investigation. Brutal: Child cage fighting can continue despite the boys being filmed without padding or head gear . Upsetting: The young boy seen here is crying in the middle of a fight, and is then attended by medical experts who check if he can carry on with the bout in a Preston working club . Battle: Kian MacKinson, nine, with an eight-year-old whose father has asked for his face to be obscured . Parental support: Kian with his father Nick Hartley, the youngster features in the shocking video which shows hundreds of baying adults goading the primary-age boys to fight each other . A source at the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘A young child being forced to take part in any violent sport could constitute child cruelty. As such, a failure to protect that child from harm could lead to a minimum 12-week sentence or a maximum 26-week sentence.’ Social services bosses in Lancashire  confirmed they had launched an inquiry into the cage fighting, which is also known as mixed martial arts, to ‘consider any child safety concerns’. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday condemned the fighting among children as young as eight as ‘barbaric’. ‘Getting more young people doing sport is great but I do ask myself whether it really does have to be in a cage,’ he said. ‘It feels very barbaric and I know there are concerns about children that young doing a sport like that.’ He added he was ‘shocked and surprised’ by claims there were no restrictions on children appearing in such adult environments. His comments came after the British Medical Association, the NSPCC and . Safechild branded child cage fighting ‘disturbing and sick’. A British . Association of Martial Arts spokesman insisted: ‘Children this young . shouldn’t be involved in cage fighting.’ Lancashire Police officers have decided to take no further action either on a child safety level or licensing of the premises. It emerged last night, however, that council chiefs have ordered a . licence review for the Greenlands Labour Club and will ask the venue not . to put on any similar events involving juveniles. The deputy leader of Preston City Council, John Swindells, said: ‘I am . appalled by the incident of cage fighting involving children taking . place in Preston. ‘Having checked the club’s licence there is a condition that children . should not be on the premises at public events after 6pm and I think it . needs to be looked into whether this condition has been breached. Professional appearance: Just like in an adult event, the tiny fighters have an entourage. Seconds out: The boys are brought together in the middle of the cage fighting ring, prepared to do battle . Grappling: The pair begin their fight slowly, testing out the space between them as they start their bout . ‘As such, I have now made a request for the licence at Greenlands Labour Club to be reviewed. A formal licensing review process will now follow.’ That could take up to three months as the club is allowed 28 days to make representations on the matter. A similar period is then opened up for members of the public to have their say. The shocking video that emerged on Wednesday shows Kian and the unnamed boy fighting without protective padding or head gear. One of them is shown apparently receiving medical attention for a leg injury and bursting into tears. Fight: Before long, they have hit the canvas and take turns in pinning each other down . Young fighters: The children wear no padding or headguards for the ten minute bout in Preston . The event was held almost a fortnight ago with about 250 adults paying £25 a ticket to watch 14 fights. The other clashes involved semi-professional adults. Sources said the night was a boisterous alcohol-fuelled affair. Sharefight, the company commissioned to film the event, said the video had been removed from the internet ‘out of respect’ for parents and others who had shown concern. The event took place in a ‘safe environment’, a spokesman added. Greenlands Labour Club has also defended its decision to hold the event. Time out: Scantily clad ring girls parade on the canvas in between rounds .

"Crowds of bewildered people gathered on Pakistan’s southern coast to witness the emergence of a new island created following a major earthquake in the region. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck 145 miles southeast of Dalbandin in Pakistan's quake-prone province of Baluchistan, which borders Iran, on Tuesday. The earthquake was so powerful that it caused the seabed to rise and create a small, mountain-like island about 600 meters off Pakistan's Gwadar coastline in the Arabian Sea. Dead fish have been spotted floating on the surface of the waters surrounding the island and visitors have heard hissing noises from the escaping toxic gas . Television channels showed images of a stretch of rocky terrain rising above the sea level, with crowds surrounding the shore to witness the rare phenomenon. Zahid Rafi, principal seismologist for the National Seismic Monitoring Center, said such masses are sometimes created by the movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea, pushing mud and earth up to the surface in something akin to a mud volcano. 'When such a strong earthquake builds pressure, there is the likelihood of such islands emerging,' he said. 'That big shock beneath the earth causes a lot of disturbance.' This liquefaction of sand layers takes . place after any earthquake, but these sudden islands are usually only . spotted after strong earthquakes, at least 7- or 8-magnitude events. An aerial view of the island taken soon after it formed. The life of this island is likely to be short, according to Nasa. The underground pocket of gas will cool, compress, or escape over time, allowing the crust to collapse and settle back down . Such masses are sometimes created by the movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea, pushing mud and earth up to the surface in something akin to a mud volcano . Waves, storms, and tidal action from the Arabian Sea will wash away the loose sand, soft clay, and mud on the island . Scientists believe the 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which struck 145 miles southeast of Dalbandin in Baluchistan, triggered what is known as 'mud volcano'. They occur where there is a reservoir of . loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder, denser rock and a . path is made to the surface. The seismic waves caused a movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea, pushing mud and earth up to the surface along with gas. These sudden islands are usually only . spotted after strong earthquakes, at least 7- or 8-magnitude events. Richard Luckett a seismologist the British Geological Survey said that these mud volcanoes are relatively common in this area on both land and at sea. ‘They occur where there is a reservoir of loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder, denser rock and a path is made to the surface,’ he told MailOnline. ‘There is a subducting plate boundary in this region where the Arabian plate is converging on the Eurasian plate at about 2cm a year and being pushed beneath it. ‘This is the same plate boundary responsible for the magnitude 7.7 earthquake.’ Scientists believe gases associated with the melting at the plate boundary contribute to heating the mud in the reservoirs and making it more fluid. ‘Certainly mud volcanoes are most common near this type of plate boundary, such as in Japan,’ said Dr Luckett. ‘It is known that mud volcanoes can be triggered by large nearby earthquakes – in fact the same thing happened in this area in 2001. ‘The exact mechanism for this triggering is poorly understood but the fact that mud volcanoes often occur without a triggering earthquake suggests that little extra impetus is required.’ To get a better idea of what the island is made of and how permanent it is, scientists will have to get samples of the material to see if it's mostly soft mud or rocks and harder material. These types of islands can remain for a long time or eventually subside back into the ocean, depending on their makeup. A Pakistani Navy team reached the island by midday Wednesday, navy geologist Mohammed Danish told the country's Geo Television. He said the mass was about 60 feet (18 meters) high, 100 feet (30 meters) long and 250 feet (76 meters) wide. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck 145 miles southeast of Dalbandin in Pakistan's quake-prone province of Baluchistan, which borders Iran, on Tuesday . 'There are stones and mud,' he said, warning residents not to try to visit the island. 'Gasses are still emitting.' But dozens of people had already visited the island, said the deputy commissioner of Gwadar district, Tufail Baloch, who travelled by boat himself to the island this morning. Water bubbled along the edges of the island, in what appeared to be gas discharging from under the surface, Baloch said. He said the area smelled of gas that caught fire when people lit cigarettes. Dead fish floated on the water's surface while local residents were visiting the island and taking stones as souvenirs, he added. Dozens of people had already visited the island despite concerns over toxic gas . Such land masses have appeared before off Pakistan's Makran coast, said Muhammed Arshad, a hydrographer with the navy. After quakes in 1999 and 2010, new land masses rose up along a different part of the coast about 282 kilometers (175 miles) east of Gwadar, he said. He said each of those disappeared back into the sea within a year during the monsoon season, a period of heavy rain and wind that sweeps Pakistan every summer. He said that in the area where the island was created on Tuesday, the sea is only about six to seven meters (23 feet) deep. Older residents of the coastal town recalled an earthquake in 1968 produced an island that stayed for one year and then vanished.","The mountain-like island appeared 600m off Pakistan's Gwadar coast .

"Sunni tribesmen took control of a border crossing between Iraq and Jordan after Iraq's army pulled out of the area following clashes with rebels, intelligence sources said yesterday. It was not immediately clear if the tribesmen's seizure of the Turaibil crossing, the only legal crossing point between Iraq and Jordan, late on Sunday was part of the broader advance by Sunni militants led by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis). The militants earlier overran posts further north along Iraq's border with Syria, pursuing their goal of forming a ‘caliphate’ straddling both countries that has raised alarm across the Middle East and in the West. Scroll down for video . Heightened state of alert: Jordanian soldiers on their tanks at the Ruwaished Iraq-Jordan border crossing . The withdrawal of the Iraqi army from the Turaibil border crossing left it with no presence along the entire western frontier, which includes some of the Middle East's most important trade routes. Jordanian army sources said their troops had been on a state of alert along the 112-mile border with Iraq for several days to ward off ‘any potential or perceived security threats’. Army units in the desert town of Ruwaished near the Iraqi-Jordanian border crossing and in other army camps in the area were put on a heightened state of alert, an army source said later yesterday. Witnesses saw dozens of armoured vehicles and scores of tanks on the highway heading to the Iraqi border crossing in what a Jordanian official said were reinforcements ‘that were sent in the last 24 hours in view of the latest developments’. On the lookout: Members of Iraqi security forces take their positions during a patrol looking for militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (Isis) at the border between Iraq and Saudi Arabia yesterday . Minister of State for Media and Communication Mohammad al-Momani told Reuters that the authorities were 'continuing to beef up defences as a preventive step in view of the security situation which Iraq is passing through'. Truck drivers who crossed the border into Jordan said Sunni tribesmen were now manning checkpoints along large stretches of the Baghdad-to-Amman highway. The Turaibil crossing remains a major artery for Sunnis in western Anbar province, and in the past two years Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has closed it several times while the Iraqi army waged security clampdowns in the region. A security official who has been in touch with Iraqi customs and local staff said the crossing was being operated by the bulk of the usual staff. They had been instructed by the Sunni tribal militants, who are now in charge of the desolate desert area, to keep it running. Binoculars: A member of Kurdish security forces takes his position during an intensive security deployment and a patrol looking for Isis militants on the outskirts of Mosul on Sunday . Reflecting the growing sectarian nature of the conflict, senior Shi'ite officials fled with the Iraqi army after the attack by Sunni tribal militants, leaving matters in the hands of Sunni employees, according to an Iraqi source familiar with developments at the border crossing. A Jordanian security source confirmed the Jordanian border post chief met with his Iraqi counterpart and agreed to keep the crossing open for traffic. The border crossing was quiet although a few trailers passed through, officials said. Other witnesses who had come from the border earlier said Sunni tribal militants had not entered the border post with their men or vehicles but were manning checkpoints almost 22 miles away, closer to the town of Rutba, 90 miles east of the border with Jordan. An Iraqi Sunni tribal leader in Anbar . province who was involved in taking over of the border crossing, told . Reuters by phone that his group had no interest in disrupting trade with . Jordan. Grief: Mourners chant slogans against the Al Qaeda breakaway group Isis after they bury 15 bodies in the village of Taza Khormato in the northern oil-rich city of Kirkuk, Iraq . ‘This crossing is a vital lifeline for our people in Anbar who get goods and food from Jordan, and we don't have an interest in scaring anyone by getting rid of the local officials and running it directly,’ he said. Many Sunni Iraqis from major tribes in Anbar have extensive ties with Jordan, where many of their wealthy kin have taken refuge and have set up large investments following widespread alienation of their community by the new Shi'ite leaders of Iraq after the end of the U.S. occupation. Gains by Isis - considered the most powerful force among armed groups who seized the Iraqi city of Falluja, west of Baghdad, and took parts of Ramadi, capital of the western Anbar province, at the start of the year - have helped it secure supply lines to Syria, where it has exploited the chaos of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad to seize territory. Jordanian officials say the loss of Iraqi government control over the border crossing was not seen as an immediate security threat to the kingdom, although many within its political establishment were unnerved by the prospect of Al Qaeda-affiliated groups along the border.","Sunni tribesmen take control of Jordan-Iraq border crossing Turaibil .

"The Governor of the Bank of England last night launched a stinging attack on the bankers who caused the financial crisis and ‘got away without sanction’. Mark Carney said the bosses of the banks behind the 2008 global financial crash should have paid a higher price for their errors. Instead – despite facing limited social embarrassment – they were still on the ‘best golf courses’. Speaking in Washington, Mr Carney said: ‘The individuals who ran the institutions got away with it. They got away with their compensation packages and without sanction. ‘Maybe they are no longer at the most esteemed table in society, but they are still on the best golf courses and that has got to change.’ Bank of England Governor Mark Carney (pictured) has told a Washington audience the bankers who caused the 2008 global financial crisis have 'got away without sanction' During a panel discussion on financial ethics, Mr Carney made it clear he had no sympathy for board-level bankers who would not take personal responsibility for the actions of their organisations. The Bank governor, who has been in Washington for a series of International Monetary Fund meetings, complained that the authorities had been unable to jail any of the bankers whose failings led to the global financial crisis. His rebuke came as two senior executives of HSBC are poised to quit their jobs over new tough rules that would see ‘reckless’ financial executives facing jail for their actions or omissions in the event of a major failing by their bank. But Mr Carney said such rules were necessary because the heads of banks during the crisis had got away with huge amounts of money without criminal sanction. He made it clear he rejected the complaints of the HSBC board members without naming the pair or specifically referring to their bank. While it was difficult to come up with acceptable compensation schemes and incentives, he said one thing that was vital to make the system safer was clearer personal responsibility. Curtailing financial rewards alone was not enough. Two senior HSBC executives are poised to quit their jobs over tough new rules on 'reckless' bank actions . He said: ‘If you are the chairman or the head of the risk committee, you have a responsibility for the activities of that institution. ‘If you don’t think you can do it, you shouldn’t be on the board.’ The new regulation regime of senior managers is designed to make it easier to bring criminal charges in a future banking crisis. Mr Carney added: ‘It does focus the mind of directors and it should. I would like to think that the minds of directors are being focused. Some of them might not like it – that’s okay.’ It emerged last week that two HSBC executives are preparing to leave the bank amid concerns over the potential personal and criminal responsibility they would face in future. Directors at Britain’s biggest companies saw their average earnings rise by a fifth last year despite a nationwide wage squeeze. Boardroom executives at FTSE 100 companies pocketed huge bonuses, according to a survey published today by pay research group Incomes Data Services (IDS). These helped push their average total earnings to £2.4million – 21 per cent higher than last year. The staggering sum is almost 100 times higher than the average wage of £26,500 per annum. FTSE 100 chief executives now typically earn 120 times more than their full-time staff, the report said. Critics said the findings showed a ‘huge gap’ in pay levels between boardrooms and ordinary workers. Most British staff have seen their pay lag behind inflation since the financial crash. The basic salary for most FTSE 100 directors rose last year by 2.5 per cent – just below the 2.8 per cent level of inflation at the time, the IDS report said. Top directors also enjoyed a 12 per cent rise in bonuses. FTSE 100 chief executives – who are generally the highest paid in any organisation – receive an average basic salary of £832,000 and an average bonus of £1million.

"Do you know your child's favorite nursery rhyme, family game or TV character? Do you know what makes them really laugh? As research reveals that one in six fathers don't know how to play with their children a leading national nursery is offering parents lessons on how to have fun with their own children. Busy Bees day nursery group, who have multiple playgroups across the UK, are offering the coaching for parents to boost their playtime skills when children go home at the end of the day. How to play: Aleeza Haider, three, and Binuthi Kannangara, three, with Chef Robert England are seen learning vital skills at Busy Bees nursery in Rotherham, South Yorkshire . The research, conducted by toy company Playmobil, states that most parents of young children worry that they do not spend enough time playing with them, while more than six out of ten parents add that they play with their children only occasionally. A third of dads say they simply do not have time to commit to playing. The course shows parents of babies and toddlers how to play more effectively and a spokesman said: ‘When parents are new, some find playtime easier than others. We encourage them to stay and play and see what their children enjoy doing. ‘Some need ideas of games and activities and others like to find out more about how to interact best with their child. ‘Parents are always beating themselves up about being a good cook for their children, and worrying whether their child is developing properly, but playtime is a time for both parents and children to enjoy. Learning while they play: Grace Ditcher, three, and Evelyn Mellor-Lobo, four, with early years educator Lucy Major at Busy Bees nursery in Rotherham (l) and Rowan Savre, 1, being shown a new game (r) ‘We have been going for 30 years and so there is a lot of experience for parents to tap into.’ It was also found that more than nine out of ten parents buy electronic toys for their children, but a third of mothers admitted to being baffled by children's high-tech gadgets and games. Peter Morley, a father of two children who attend Busy Bees nursery in Guiseley, West Yorks, said, ‘I would hope that my children would say I am doing ok. ‘Busy Bees nurseries hold stay and play sessions and they would be a really good starting point for those parents who need encouragement and ideas.’ Sharon Pearce, an independent play therapist, noted, ‘Parents should play with their children to improve the parent child relationship and increase behaviour and mental health. ‘Parents are under a lot of pressure to be doing everything at once, but playtime is more important than cleaning the house or the other 100 jobs that need doing. Busy Bees nursery at Guiseley, West Yorkshire . ‘Playing doesn't need to be expensive. It is about fantasy and a cardboard box and bits of paper. ‘It is like a bank and the more time you spend playing with your children, the better the outcomes will be.’ Margaret Randles, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Busy Bees, said, ‘When a parent chooses Busy Bees as their childcare partner I believe that we have an obligation to provide a range of support and advice. ‘As a parent myself I know every day brings a different challenge, and sometimes you often feel that you are making it up as you go along. ‘I have always found that having someone to confide in or just to provide reassurance on any issues is helpful. ‘I consider myself to be very fortunate that when I had my first child I lived above the nursery and had the expertise readily available. ‘We would always want our parents to know that we are there to support them. That's what a true partnership is.’","Busy Bees day nursery group offering parents playtime skills .

"A Canadian journalist working undercover in a Bangladeshi sweatshop has revealed details of the back-breaking work and appalling conditions children as young as nine have to deal with. Raveena Aulakh traveled to Dhaka to experience firsthand conditions in garment factories that mass produce products for the West. Her account in the Toronto Star sheds light on the long hours, poor pay and dangerous and unsanitary conditions factory workers are subjected to. Heart breaking: Nine-year-old factory worker Meem was in charge of training undercover reporter Raveena Aulakh . Investigation: Toronto Star reporter Raveena Aulakh worked undercover at a Dhaka garment factory . Most shocking of all was how a nine-year-old girl named Meem, forced into work to help raise money for her family, was put in charge of training Ms Aulakh. 'The first time I saw Meem, which was . also my first day at work at a sweatshop, she was having a good day . despite the wretched heat. She sat cross-legged on the concrete floor, a . tiny, frail figure among piles of collars, cuffs and other parts of . unstitched shirts,' Ms Aulakh wrote in the Toronto Star. The reporter's investigation came in the wake of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in April, when more than 1,100 workers died. After what became known as the worst garment factory disaster in the world, there was intense scrutiny of working conditions and child labor. But the larger factories also brought in improved security and screening programs, making it harder for undercover investigators to gain access. Ms Aulakh was able to find work only after a Bangladeshi driver told a small factory owner, named Hamid, that she was related to his wife and had moved to the city for work. Child labor: Taaniya, 13, was one of the youngsters working 12-hour days at the factory . After being offered a trial, Ms Aulakh found herself arriving at the sweatshop on an oppressively hot day in August. 'The factory wasn’t big: about two dozen . sewing machines lined the walls of the windowless room, about half the . size of a basketball court. Two cutting machines sat in a corner. The . sewing machines had little benches for the operators, and almost all had . piles of colorful fabric by the side. Three ceiling fans, covered with . layers of dirt, hummed quietly,' she wrote. A quick tour of the building revealed no fire extinguishers, only one exit - the front door - and little more than a hole in the ground, down a rat-infested hall, for the toilet. Staff worked from 9am to 9pm with only a lunch break. The girls tasked with snipping off threads from the men's shirts being made, had to sit cross legged in the middle of the floor. Ms Aulakh joined the girls on the floor and, under Meem's direction, was taught how to snip away loose threads without marking the clothes. 'It was back-breaking, it was . finger-numbing. It was particularly rage-inducing,' she said. 'Not because it was . painfully hard work but because children like Meem hunched over hour . after hour, squinted at the threads, cleaned one collar after another, . one cuff after another, one arm piece after another until the piles were . depleted.' Like many young factory workers, Meem was taken out of school when the family ran into hardship. With her mother pregnant and unable to work, the family needed Meem to help boost the income. Disaster: More than 1,100 factory workers were killed when a Dhaka sweatshop collapsed in April . Focus: Working conditions came under the spotlight after the Rana Plaza building collapsed . Her father found her the job at Hamid's factory because the girl's aunt also worked there and would be able to look after her. Overnight, Meem went from being a carefree schoolgirl to a factory worker, toiling for 12 hours a day. 'It works for everyone,' Smitha Zaheed, of the Dhaka-based Independent Garment Workers’ Union Federation, said. 'Factory . owners get workers who are not demanding ... while the parents get to . keep what the kids earn because the kids don’t know any better.' Meem's wages are paid to her father and she is allowed to buy herself a glittery hair clip each month and an occasional ice-cream. 'It is not as if Meem’s parents don’t . care for her, they simply had no choice,' Ms Aulakh wrote. Despite the long hours and aches caused from sitting hunched over for hours at a time, Meem was always smiling and her only complaint was that she was yelled at if she chatted too much or hummed too loudly. Workers like Meem are paid about $25 a month. They are allowed half a day off every Friday and do not get holidays or paid sick leave. In a country with widespread poverty however, such jobs are valued and Meem had ambitions to move up the factory chain to become a better-paid sewing operator. 'When I become a sewing operator, I will make very good shirts,' she said. 'No one will yell at me.' The lifestyle is so common in Bangladesh that Meem and another of the girls, 13-year-old Taaniya think nothing of ending their education early. Even at their young ages they knew how the extra money could help and talked of how their families had been able to buy furniture and goats. Ambition: Becoming a sewing operator like Lootfah, above, is the dream of girls like Meem . Taaniya also hoped she could earn enough to avoid being married off to a stranger. 'By all accounts, working women are changing their lives, . their families’ lives,' Ms Aulakh said. 'There is more food in homes, and cleaner clothes. There is electricity, even if it’s one bulb, and there are toilets ... But it has come at a price.' For children like Meem, the factory has become their life. Ms Aulakh may have been able to return to her comfortable home and office job, but the knowledge that thousands of girls remain trapped in such back-breaking work has stayed with her.","Raveena Aulakh documents life in garment factory .

"Probe: Police have today revealed an independent investigation will now consider whether former Lib Dem Rochdale MP Cyril Smith's child abuse was covered-up . Police have today revealed they are chasing up to 11 new suspects linked to sex abuse by former Liberal MP Cyril Smith. Greater Manchester Police has said it will also review evidence of claims that Smith was subject to a top-level cover-up spanning 35 years, including by MI5 agents. It came as the Liberal Democrats came under . further pressure over their former MP after even his family called for an . independent inquiry into allegations he had abused boys. Police are already investigating allegations of historic sex abuse by Smith in Rochdale, where he was an MP for 20 years. But it has today announced that it is looking into claims that abuse may have been swept under the carpet by officials and politicians in Rochdale Council between 1961 and 1995. The review will be carried out by a QC, with any evidence of criminality then passed to the police, who say they are 'trying to trace' others who may have abused children or helped hide it. Detectives will review a range of sources, including allegations in the book by current Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, serialised in the Mail, which claimed police, politicians and even MI5 had been involved in a cover-up. Mr Danczuk said: 'The scandal is that nothing has been done for so many years, and what we now need is some action by the local authority and by the police to ensure that it’s bought to a conclusion.' Officers are already investigating . claims of abuse at Knowl View residential school, which closed in 1992, . but are now to review whether any evidence points to a cover-up by the . council. Rochdale Council is due to hear the findings of an independent review into the running of Knowl View next month. Officers . are also looking into claims he abused boys at the privately run . Cambridge House children’s care home, which closed in 1965. GMP chief constable Sir Peter Fahy: 'As a result of the publicity and the discussion around the book recently published about child abuse in Rochdale, we are carrying out a review into those allegations and into other matters of public debate around that book to see whether that justifies a criminal investigation into allegations of (a) cover-up. 'There are a significant number of . people we are trying to trace, obviously made more difficult by the . passage of time. 'Given the degree of public . speculation around this particular book and the allegations made in it, . we think it would clearly be strange if we did not look at that and . carry out a review as to whether that justified a wider criminal . investigation.' Fury: Norman Smith (left), the brother of Cyril Smith (right), has slammed the abuse claims . Allegations about Sir Cyril’s conduct were first published in 1979. In . a statement, his family said they did not believe the claims against . him – but would be happy to co-operate with a proper inquiry. The intervention is uncomfortable for Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who has rejected calls for such a probe. Last week he urged the police to investigate whether there had been an Establishment cover-up of Smith's activities. But he rejected calls for a full inquiry, headed by an independent figure, or for the Lib Dems themselves to hold their own probe, saying only the police could do the job properly. Yesterday Tim Farron, the party's president, claimed that if the Lib Dems held their own probe it would 'interfere' with the police inquiry. But pressure intensified as a former president of the Liberal Party claimed there was a culture of 'cowardice' that protected Smith from allegations of abuse in the same way as the BBC protected Jimmy Savile. Des Wilson said rumours of Smith's sex attacks on boys had reached senior figures, but then leader David Steel took no action because the leadership had their 'heads in the sand'. And he accused Mr Clegg of being 'more than naïve' for lauding the former Rochdale MP on his death. Smith is the subject of two police inquiries into child abuse. The Crown Prosecution Service say they believe Smith, who died in 2010, did carry out attacks. The Smith family released a statement on Saturday, saying they would welcome an inquiry. 'We find many of the claims bizarre and difficult to believe, an independent inquiry would determine their truth or otherwise,' it said. 'The person they are describing is not the person known to family, friends, colleagues and constituents.' Smith's brother Norman, a former mayor of Rochdale, said: 'I don't believe any of these outrageous claims. They're so shocking I don't know how they could have been hidden at the time. 'I think these people were damaged and they are just trying to ruin his reputation now when he can't defend himself. I think it is despicable.' Mr Farron has admitted the Lib Dems face 'serious questions' over who knew about allegations against Smith. But he rejected calls for both an inquiry and for the party to hold an internal probe, saying the matter should be left to the police. 'It's very, very important that the police are allowed to proceed with full investigations without any kind of hampering or speculation on a political level,' he told Sky News. Mr Wilson was president of the Liberals from 1986 to 1987, and led the Lib Dems' election campaign in 1992. In an article for a Sunday newspaper he praised a book by current Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk for exposing Smith as 'a serial sexual abuser of small boys'. Mr Wilson said Lord Steel, who was Liberal leader between 1976 and 1988. did not take action because he 'hated confrontation'. He said Liberal MPs at the time included a drunk, one who would hang around clubs with attractive boys, and a number who were having affairs with their secretaries. All this meant there was no appetite to challenge Smith.","Council, police and MI5 accused of cover-up of abuse at schools and home .

"Giving prisoners the right to vote will do nothing to stop them reoffending Chris Grayling insisted today. The Justice Secretary claimed having a job and somewhere to live after leaving jail were more important factors in preventing them returning to a life of crime. And he vowed that the British Parliament would be ‘sovereign’ in deciding whether to implement a controversial ruling from the European Court of Human Rights that inmates should be able to take part in elections. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling insisted there was no evidence giving prisoners the vote would stop them reoffending when they were released . European judges have ruled that the Britain's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights. In February 2012 the Commons called for the ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22, despite repeated warnings from Strasbourg. Since then ministers have published a draft bill on the issue, while stressing that the UK Parliament is ‘sovereign’ and it was up to MPs to decide whether or not to comply with ECHR rulings. The government has sought to kick the issue into the long grass, by investigating a raft of options including allowing prisoners to vote during the last six months of their sentence. Mr Grayling admitted the plan would be difficult to implement, because it is not always known so far in advance when a prisoner would be released. Mr Grayling repeatedly told the justice select committee: 'Parliament is sovereign in these matters' Giving evidence to the justice select committee, Mr Grayling repeatedly rejected the idea that being allowed to vote in elections from behind bars would do anything to prevent them committing a crime again after release. Labour MP Paul Flynn pointed to South Africa, where he claimed prisoners were given the vote 'as a process of giving them some small responsibility'. But Mr Grayling said: ‘I have not seen any evidence that suggests to me that introduction of votes for prisoners would have any material effect on reoffending rates. ‘My experience is that a house and a job are much more important.’ The prisoner voting row has been running since 2005, when Strasbourg judges ordered Britain to give the vote to convicted prisoners, who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate. Despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the Commons, the European judges have continued to repeat their instructions. A string of Tory MPs - led by the Prime Minister - are resisting demands from the European Court of Human Rights for some inmates to be granted the right to vote . In 2010, David Cameron said it makes him 'physically ill' to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison. In December last year the Prime Minister insisted Britain 'damned well shouldn't' be forced to comply with the European judges. The government insists it is complying with the rule of law, despite delaying attempts to respond to the ruling. Mr Grayling added: 'The worst thing we could do is implement a change inappropriately. Parliament is sovereign in these matters. ‘If we are to introduce votes for prisoners, it will have to be with the consent of Parliament.’ There are concerns that 2,300 compensation claims from prisons banned from voting have be reactivated by the ruling, costing the British taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds. But Mr Grayling said: ‘The court has started that the process in a small number of cases. We don’t intend to play an active part in the court. We don’t believe that any compensation will be payable in the judgement, whatever the outcome.’","Chris Grayling rejects the idea of using votes as part of rehabilitation .

"Low fat food sold as good  for you is often anything but because it contains more sugar, a study suggests. It found manufacturers are making their ‘healthy’ options more palatable by replacing fat with sugar. Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Wolfson Institute, said people need to reduce their consumption of both. Investigation: Dispatches found that one of Waitrose’s own-brand low-fat vinaigrette (right) had ten times the sugar content of the standard version (left) - 15.6g compared to 1.58g . Claim: Tesco allegedly puts almost three times as much sugar into its ‘25 per cent less fat’ peanut butter (right) than in its ordinary spread (left) - 15.2g compared to 5.5g . ‘The problem is, not only are we . developing vascular disease but we’re getting obese and getting . diabetes, and that’s due to too many calories,’ he added. ‘Fat . is a major source of calories but so is sugar, and added sugar is an . unnecessary part of our diet. It is a dangerous substance that’s making . us obese.’ The study, . conducted for a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation to be broadcast . tonight, found that a ‘skinny’ lemon and poppyseed muffin from Starbucks . had 44.3g of sugar, or just over 11 teaspoons. That . is much more than the 35g in a can of Coca-Cola and the same as in a . triple Belgian choc Mississippi mud muffin from the same chain. The . Starbucks ‘skinny’ blueberry muffin contains 34.7g of sugar – 8.6 . teaspoons – which is more than the 28.1g in the ‘classic’ version of the . same product. Last week, . the World Health Organisation closed a consultation on guidance . recommending that no more than 10 per cent of our daily calories should . come from ‘free sugar’ added by manufacturers or naturally occurring in . food. This is the equivalent of 12 teaspoons. However, . even supposedly healthy fruit juices and smoothies can contain much . more than this. A supersize massimo version of Costa’s ‘red berry . cooler’, for example, contains 97.1g of sugar, equivalent to around 24 . teaspoons. Comparison: Morrisons frozen chicken tikka masala (top) meal contains 7.4g of sugar - less than half what is in the NuMe chicken tikka masala meal (bottom) of 16.3g . Fruit-based . drinks from Caffe Nero, Starbucks, McDonald’s and Pret A Manger were . also heavy on sugar, containing the equivalent of more than 12 spoons. There . is growing concern about the issue and health experts, including the . Government’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, have suggested a . ‘sugar tax’ may be necessary to cut consumption. The . Dispatches study found a 400g pack of Morrisons NuMe low-fat chicken . tikka masala and pilau rice contains 16.3g of sugar, compared with 7.4g . in its standard frozen equivalent. A . similar trend was seen in low-fat yoghurt. For example, a 150g pot of . Waitrose black cherry low-fat yoghurt has 26.3g of sugar – 6.5 teaspoons . – compared with 21.2g in its ‘lavish creamy’ equivalent. Lower-fat . biscuits are another culprit. For example, Sainsbury’s ‘35% less fat’ lighter ginger snaps have 4.2g of sugar per biscuit, or just over a . teaspoon. That compares with 3.4g for its standard ginger snap. The . study also found people eat more when food is promoted and labelled as . low fat. ‘People take it as a green light,’ said dietician Nicole . Berberian. ‘It is misleading.’ She . added: ‘Low-fat foods can be good for you, but that is not always the . case.

"Eco-friendly LED lights may damage your eyes, according to new research. A study has discovered that exposure to LED lights can cause irreparable harm to the retina of the human eye. LED lights have been touted as a super-efficient alternative to traditional bulbs because they use up to 85 per cent less energy and each bulb can last up to 10 years. In April, Philips, the world's biggest lighting maker, reported a 38 per cent jump in LED light sales from last year. A Spanish study has shown that the light emitted by LED bulbs can damage the cells in the retina. Some experts are now calling for a filter to be fitted in the bulbs (file picture) They are already widely used in mobile phones, televisions, computer screens and can also be fitted as a replacement for traditional lighting in the home. LEDs are much more expensive that traditional bulbs - costing around £25 for an equivalent 100w compared to around £1 for an incandescent bulb - although manufacturers claim that consumers make their money back because the use such little energy. The government announced it was phasing out incandescent bulbs in 2007 after an EU directive banned their use. The 100w bulb was the first to go in 2009 and lower wattage bulbs continue to be phased out gradually. The ban caused public outrage as customers were forced to spend large sums of money on lighting that not only gave an unpleasantly 'cold' light but also caused some people to report symptoms of itchy skin and headaches. The government's Enhanced Capital Allowance Scheme, which was brought in to help cut UK carbon emissions, is also pushing the use of LED lighting by offering businesses added tax relief if they use LED and other low-energy bulbs. Dr. Celia Sánchez-Ramos, of Complutense University in Madrid and who led the study,  explained that light from LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, comes from the short-wave, high-energy blue and violet end of the visible light spectrum. Incandescent bulbs (left) are being phased out in favour of low-energy alternatives such as CFLs (right), but there are concerns about the safety of the new generation of so-called 'environmentally friendly' lighting . She said that prolonged, continuous exposure to this light may be enough to damage a person's retina. The retina is composed of light-sensitive tissue that is responsible for detecting light and in turn allowing us to see. ‘This problem is going to get worse, because humans are living longer  and children are using electronic devices from a young age, particularly for schoolwork,’ Sánchez-Ramos told ThinkSpain.com. Enterprising: Lighting shop owner Kerry Nicholau, from . Twickenham, stockpiled 3000 incandescent bulbs after 75 watt bulbs were . phased out in 2011 . ‘Eyes are not designed to look directly at light — they are designed to see with light,’ Sánchez-Ramos said. Her comments are partly based on her 2012 study that was published in the journal Photochemistry and Photobiology. The study found that LED radiation caused significant damage to human retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro. Sánchez-Ramos added that modern humans . have their eyes open for roughly 6,000 hours a year, and are exposed to . artificial light for the majority of that time. Some experts have called for the LED lights to have built-in filters to cut out the blue glare. This is not the first time energy-saving . lights have come under scrutiny for safety reasons. Compact fluorescent . light bulbs, or CFLs, have been criticized for the high levels of mercury they contain as well as the UV radiation they can emit. LED lights have also been blamed for the changing hues of masterpieces in art galleries. A study carried out by the University of Antwerp earlier this year found that LED lights were bleaching the paint on works by Van Gogh and Cézanne.","Spanish research has shown that blue LED light can irreparably damage the cells in the eye's retina .

"Fearful: Popular Commons Speaker George Thomas dreaded interest in his sexual proclivities . The row over claims of an establishment cover-up of an alleged paedophile ring took a new turn last night over fresh claims concerning former Commons Speaker George Thomas. When late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens tried to expose public figures he claimed were involved in a Westminster child sex ring in the 1980s, Thomas, who was in the Speaker’s chair at the time, had himself been blackmailed over his homosexuality. Furthermore, The Mail on Sunday has been told of claims that Thomas, who later became Viscount Tonypandy, propositioned young men in the Speaker’s official grace and favour apartment in Parliament. A senior political source said: ‘Thomas had an interest in young men and did not hide it at Westminster.’ In the 1960s, Thomas was a Minister in the Home Office, which is accused of losing over 114 files on alleged child sex cases, including Dickens’S dossier in the 1980s. And he reportedly used his Home Office position to help Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe – who was later acquitted of attempted murder of his gay lover – to cover up an alleged homosexual offence against a minor. The disclosures follow the announcement of official inquiries into claims of a Westminster paedophile ring and a Home Office cover-up. Thomas, who died in 1997, was one of Britain’s best-loved and most influential public figures as Speaker from 1976 to 1983. A Methodist lay preacher, he was a Home Office Minister in Harold Wilson’s Labour Government and joined the Cabinet. As Speaker, he had unrivalled power, including control of Commons debates, security and disciplining MPs and even reading the lesson at Prince Charles’s 1981 wedding to Lady Diana Spencer. Influence: Thomas 'helped Jeremy Thorpe, later charged with a plot to kill his gay lover, to cover up an offence against a minor' Close friend and fellow Welsh Labour MP Leo Abse revealed before his death in 2008 that his friend and ally Thomas lived in constant fear of being unmasked as a homosexual. Abse, who led the campaign to legalise homosexuality, said Thomas was blackmailed for being gay and added: ‘The slightest tremor of scandal, however faintly reverberating into his private domain, reduced him to jelly. ‘In 1976, I found him grey-faced and trembling,’ said Abse. ‘Investigative journalists were pursuing inquiries into Thorpe. They had reached the conclusion that 16 years earlier, political intervention saved Thorpe from being prosecuted for a homosexual offence against a minor. 'They believed that when Thorpe became embroiled in another scandal in 1964, he feared Home Office records of his earlier misbehaviour would wreck his efforts to free himself.’ Abse said Thorpe – using his friend, fraudster and Liberal MP Peter Bessell, as an intermediary – ‘turned to George for help. Yielding to Bessell’s importuning, George set up a private meeting between Bessell and the Home Secretary [Frank Soskice]’. ‘George was frightened the journalists would be more interested in his own sexual proclivities than in Thorpe’s,’ added Abse. 'He asked for £800 to pay extortioner... he felt trapped' Labour MP Leo Abse, who led the campaign to legalise homosexuality, died six years ago. In 2001, in a book on Tony Blair, Mr Abse revealed how his friend, the former Commons Speaker George Thomas, was secretly blackmailed for being gay. By LEO ABSE . The phone rang at 6am. ‘George here,’ came a familiar voice. It was my friend George Thomas, secret homosexual and – until barely a year beforehand – superb Speaker of the House of Commons. His voice sounded strangulated, and George was sobbing. ‘I’m in terrible, terrible trouble. Come quickly.’ I immediately thought he was phoning me from a police station. My heart sank. I feared he was about to be crushed by scandal. Revelations: Labour MP Leo Abse was a loyal friend of George Thomas . I knew I had to dash to him; he would panic if there was the slightest sign of a crack in the thin ice upon which he skated all his life. George was 75 and one of the best-known men in Britain. He had been Speaker for seven years, an MP since 1945, Home Office Minister in the 1960s and Secretary of State for Wales. He was a prominent lay preacher, read the lesson at the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and enjoyed a warm relationship with the Queen Mother. During his political life, George could benignly sublimate his inclinations. But those inclinations could not always be contained under the fraternal rubric. Sometimes, overwhelmed, what he regarded as lapses did occur. Given his exposed position, it was inevitable that he would fall victim to blackmail. On one occasion, after a distraught recounting to me of the pressure upon him, I insisted I would meet and deal with the young criminal in his Cardiff constituency into whose hands he had fallen. The blackmailing cur had no doubt that, unless he desisted, I would carry out my threat to ensure he was put behind bars for ten years. Shortly after our encounter, he found it politic to quit the city. George had always been on the edge of catastrophe. I learnt he was visiting a grubby cinema in Westminster where, under cover of the darkness, groping prevailed unchecked. I warned him against his lack of discretion. Alarmed that I had been able to know about his haunt, he thereafter kept well away from it. But there were times when my advice had gone unheeded. While still a backbench MP, he asked me for a loan. The specificity and size of the loan, £800, aroused my suspicions. He poured out the story. I urged him to let me deal with this extortioner. But to no avail. That sum – the ticket and resettlement money which was to take the man to Australia – would, George insisted, mark the end of the affair. I had profound misgivings but I could see George was near breaking point. I gave him the money. The slightest tremor of scandal, however faintly reverberating into his private domain, reduced him to jelly. One such occasion was in 1976 when, summoned to his sitting room in the Speaker’s house, I found him grey-faced and trembling. Journalists were pursuing inquiries into the then Liberal leader, Jeremy Thorpe. They had concluded that, 16 years earlier, political intervention saved Thorpe from being prosecuted for a homosexual offence against a minor. They also believed that when Thorpe became embroiled in another scandal in 1964, he feared Home Office records of his earlier misbehaviour would wreck his efforts to free himself. Thorpe – using fraudulent Liberal MP Peter Bessell, as an intermediary – had turned to George, then a junior Home Office Minister, for help. Yielding to Bessell’s importuning, George had set up a private meeting between Bessell and the Home Secretary. The journalists wanted a probing interview with George. He felt trapped. He was frightened his motivation in assisting Bessell was under scrutiny and that the journalists, if denied the interview, would become more interested in his own sexual proclivities than in Thorpe’s. I had noted at funerals and marriages his penchant for using texts from the epistle to the Corinthians (on the ‘sin’ of homosexuality) – as he would again in the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1981. I told him he must pull rank and indicate the impropriety of the Speaker granting a private interview. He took my advice, and regained his equanimity. He never again turned to me for assistance – until that poignant early-morning call in 1984, the year after his retirement. It turned out he was not at a police station, as I feared, but in a hospital. Puzzled and concerned, I rushed to him. There was, I knew, a link between his past flights into illness and dangerous threats of exposure. Once, when he was a backbencher, it drove him into hospital with a bout of shingles. Sometimes, overwhelmed with praise, his guilt at the encomiums being bestowed upon such a ‘sinner’ crushed him. (He collapsed at a party given for him at Guildhall to celebrate his 80th birthday.) I wondered, as I approached the hospital that dawn, what ghost had visited the haunted man this time. Before I even arrived, he phoned my wife three times. I reached George’s bed and found him convulsively sobbing. He grabbed my hand and said he was ruined. Soon the whole world would know that he was in hospital suffering from ... venereal disease. I chastened him to get a grip. ‘Waterworks’ was the answer, I explained. He should allow it to be known he had been rushed to hospital with prostate difficulties. It worked. George entered enthusiastically into the tale I had created for him. He even sent me, from the hospital, a beflowered ‘thank you’ card obviously designed to be shown to my wife. It read: ‘Dear Leo, I shall be for ever grateful. Strangely enough there had been no need for me to worry – it was all in my brain! I am due for the prostate gland operation next Wednesday. Love to you all. George.’ My wife laughed indulgently at his naivety that she would be deceived; but it helped George to think so and very soon he was out of hospital – taking, I hoped, the precautions that would avoid his ever again being placed in such a predicament. Once, after I had saved him from the consequences of some escapade, he could not contain his anger against the homophobic hostilities which had so dogged him. With tears in his eyes, he railed: ‘Bust them, Leo. I do not care a damn what is said after I’m dead but I couldn’t stand them taunting me in my lifetime.’ Extract from Leo Abse’s book Tony Blair: The Man Behind The Smile, Robson Books, 2001.","Fresh claims concern former Commons Speaker George Thomas, who later became Viscount Tonypandy .

"China today executed a man who killed a two-year-old girl by throwing her on the ground following a row with her mother over a parking space. Han Lei was sentenced to death in September after the incident in which he confronted the child's . mother in a car park in Beijing, claiming her shopping . trolley was in his way. During the altercation in July, he beat the woman to the ground, snatched the child from her buggy and raised her above his head before throwing her to the ground. Executed: Han Lei was stenced to death for murdering a two-year-old girl in a row with her mother over a parking space . He and a friend in the vehicle then drove away. The toddler died two days later of her injuries, provoking widespread public outrage. Han was sentenced to death two months after the incident. He appealed against the penalty without success. He had claimed to have been drunk and told Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court during his trial he believed he was only throwing a trolley to the ground. He asked for the charge of intentional homicide to be reduced to involuntary homicide, which carries a sentence of between three and seven years instead of a mandatory life sentence. But China's Supreme Court approved the sentence and he was executed on Friday, the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court said on a verified microblog account. Han reportedly told prosecutors last year he felt so guilty and distressed that he wanted to die, according to previous Chinese media reports. 'I caused such a calamity for the child... please make sure that I am sentenced to death,' he was quoted as saying. 'I don't want to live any more.' Han was sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for stealing a car but was released 2012 after the sentence was commuted, the reports said. A second man, Li Ming, who drove Han away from the scene, was sentenced to five years in prison for hiding the suspect at the original trial. .","Han Lei was sentenced to death after a trial in Beijing in September .

"Another victim: 2007 Gang-rape victim Kainat Soomro was labelled a 'black virgin' and shunned by her rural village after she accused her alleged attackers . The brave fight of a gang-rape victim shunned by her rural Pakistani village for accusing her alleged attackers is now the subject of a heartbreaking documentary. Kainat Soomro was labelled a 'kari', or 'black virgin', and her own family ordered to kill her in order to rid themselves of shame after she said she was attacked by four men as a 13-year-old in 2007. But the teenager's relatives refused to turn their back on Kainat, and vowed to support her as she took the extraordinary step of fighting for justice in defiance of moral laws that have been in place in Pakistan for centuries. The years that have passed since Kainat's nightmare ordeal have proved no less difficult, with her family forced out of their village, Dadu, amid threats of violence and murder. Her father and one of her brothers were beaten, while an older brother disappeared for three months before being found murdered. Kainat's pursuit of the case through a legal system which places the burden of proof on the victim ended with her alleged attackers being acquitted. Kainat and her family, who now live in a cramped two bedroom apartment in Karachi, say they have 'lost everything', a report on news.com.au said. A documentary, called Outlawed in Pakistan, tells the story of Kainat's fight for justice against the odds. The documentary, first unveiled at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, aired for the first time on U.S. television last week. 'They told me I am not a real man,' Kainat’s brother, Sabir, tells film-makers Habiba Nosheen and Hilke . Schellmann. '[that] you failed to follow your tradition, you failed to . kill your sister.' Viewers watch as Kainat hires a lawyer, makes television appearances and appeals against court decisions. But despite her persistence, the film's narrator tells how the judge describes her accusations as 'a product of her own fantasy'. Following their acquittal, the men she accused wonder why she didn't just stay home 'and keep quiet'. Outlawed in Pakistan shines a spotlight on the fight Kainat insists she will never give up, in spite of the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in her path.","Kainat Soomro attacked by four men as a 13-year-old girl .

"America's largest producer of Thanksgiving turkeys has announced a shortage of fresh birds, just as millions of families begin clearing space in their fridge for the holidays. Butterball said Friday that it had fewer than usual fresh large turkeys because its poultry has had trouble gaining weight on some of the company's farms. While there are ample supplies of its frozen large varieties, Butterball told retailers, including East Coast grocery chain Big Y Foods Inc, their orders for fresh turkeys 16 pounds and bigger have been cut by 50 per cent. Shortage: Butterball said Friday that it had fewer than usual fresh large turkeys because its poultry has had trouble gaining weight on some of the company's farms . 'We experienced a decline in weight gains on some of our farms causing a limited availability of large, fresh turkeys,' Stephanie Llorente, a spokeswoman for Butterball, said in a written statement. She added that they didn't know why their birds were more svelte than normal this year. 'While we are continuing to evaluate all potential causes, we are working to remedy the issue. 'We sincerely regret the inconvenience that some of our customers have experienced as a result of this issue.' The shortage is a major concern as the company, headquartered in Garner, North Carolina, produces around 20 per cent of the country's turkeys - or more than one billion pounds a year - and 16 pounds is the average weight of birds served up on the Thanksgiving dinner table.

The popular brand, known for its blue, gold and yellow label, is a mainstay in American kitchens every Thanksgiving. However, there are a number of other brands that should be delighted to fill the gap.

"A skating national anthem singer proved that the show must go on when he tripped over a red carpet and went flying across the ice at a hockey game in British Colombia.

The embarrassing trip has already been viewed almost two million times on You Tube. Mr Donnelly, 54, a legendary anthem singer for the Vancouver Canucks, was singing at a British Columbia Hockey League game in Penticton last week. The father-of-nine has been skating since the age of 10, and he has sung the Canadian national anthem on the ice nearly 40 times before without ever slipping up. 'There was a ceremonial face-off beforehand and the carpet was supposed to have been taken up,' Mr Donnelly told ABC News. 'On the video, it looks much brighter than it is - but on the ice it's quite dark.' Mr Donnelly had only just started singing the anthem when he skated up to the red carpet and took a tumble . The father-of-nine keeps belting out the anthem as he hits the deck after tripping over the red carpet . 'I didn't even see the carpet until I'd skated around the team and come around the other side to see what I'd tripped on,' he added. 'That's what I was thinking about while I kept singing: ""What the heck did I trip on?""' Fortunately, Mr Donnelly was not hurt in the tumble, although he did suffer a sore left knee and a slight dent to his pride. 'I'm sure I'm going to be getting a few offers of skating lessons,' he joked. The indomitable singer  stumbles twice before finally making it to his feet again and gliding off on his skates . The singer glides off on his skates all without missing a beat of his rousing rendition of 'O Canada' When asked how he was able to keep singing even as he hit the ice, Mr Donnelly told ABC that he had applied a lesson from another part of his life. 'I recently lost half my body weight and I give presentations on goal setting and perseverance, so I guess I kind of applied my own advice to that by keeping on,' said Mr Donnelly, who went from 370 pounds to around 180 pounds in two years.

"The number of people forced from their homes by conflict and persecution has passed 50million in a year for the first time since the Second World War. Some 51.2million sought shelter last  year – the equivalent of almost the entire population of England. The figure, revealed by the United Nations, is up six million from 2012, largely due to Syrians fleeing civil war. Iraqis who have fled the violence in their hometown of Mosul line arrive at Khazir refugee camp outside of Irbil north of Baghdad . Sunni militants captured a strategic city along the highway to Syria on forcing many to flee . United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Antonio Guterres greets a Syrian child during his visit to Khaldeh, south of Beirut, Lebanon . The UN’s high commissioner for refugees, Antonio Gutteres, said: ‘These numbers represent a quantum leap in forced displacement around the world. For the first time since the Second World War, we had in 2013 more than 50million people displaced by conflict and persecution either crossing borders or within the borders of their countries.’ Some 16.7million of the total had crossed their own nation’s borders. By the end of last year, 2.5million Syrians had become refugees in neighbouring countries while more than 6.5million had been displaced within Syria. The latest figures do not include the half million people believed to have fled violence in Iraq over the past week. The massive increase was mainly driven by Syria's civil war. By the end of last year, 2.5 million Syrians had become refugees in neighboring countries and more than 6.5 million had been displaced within Syria, the U.N. agency said. A Syrian refugee girl weeps during the visit of Antonio Guterres, where he met Syrian refugees to discuss the situation with Lebanese officials . Eritrean female asylum seekers sit along with their children on the sidewalk in Sanaa, Yemen . Since April, over 200 Eritrean asylum seekers including women and children have been living on the streets of Sanaa . The daunting numbers — which are straining the resources of host countries and aid organizations alike — also are a stark reflection of the ongoing conflicts and persecution in other countries, including the Central African Republic and South Sudan. 'These numbers represent a quantum leap in forced displacement around the world,' Guterres said. 'For the first time since the second world war, we had in 2013 more than 50 million people displaced by conflict and persecution either crossing borders or within the borders of their countries.' Aid agencies have struggled to keep pace with worsening conflicts in Syria, the Central African Republic and South Sudan, and on Friday the World Food Program, a U.N. agency, said it was forced to cut rations to refugees in several countries. For the first time since the World War II era, the number of people forced from their homes worldwide has surged past 50 million . 'We are being squeezed, other U.N. agencies are increasingly squeezed, NGOs are squeezed,' spokesman Peter Smerdon told The Associated Press. 'This means that ultimately the poor, the most vulnerable, the innocent civilians who have escaped conflicts with their lives and reached refuge in a country which is at peace, they will suffer because their assistance cannot be delivered.' The over-50-million number includes refugees and asylum-seekers who fled abroad as well as people displaced within their own countries. The data was compiled from government, non-government partner organizations and UNHCR's own records. Eritrean asylum seekers eat lunch together on the sidewalk in Sanaa, Yemen . Theirs was one of the three worst-affected nations, along with Afghanistan and Somalia.

"The United States last night joined the United Nations in condemning Israel after tank shells tore apart a school refuge in Gaza killing 15 men, women and children and injuring more than 100. The victims, who had fled their homes after warnings from Israel’s military and were sheltering in the school, were killed yesterday morning when two classrooms were destroyed. UN officials said they had told the Israeli military 17 times that the school in Gaza’s biggest refugee camp was a shelter for Palestinian civilians fleeing fighting in the coastal strip.

Suffering: A boy injured in an Israeli airstrike clings to his father as he is treated at a hospital in Gaza yesterday . Last night, in a rare criticism of Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip, the White House said it was ‘extremely concerned’ that thousands of Palestinians were not safe even in UN-designated shelters. Spokesman Bernadette Meehan said: ‘This violence underscores the need to achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible.’ Later yesterday, 15 Palestinians were killed and 160 wounded in an Israeli air strike which blew apart a busy market in Shejaiya. The air strike happened during a four-hour ceasefire, which Israel later claimed applied only to areas where its soldiers were not already operating. Speaking about the warnings that the school was being used as a shelter, Pierre Krahenbuhl, head of the United Nations Relief And Works Agency (UNRWA), said the last notification was given just hours before the pre-dawn attack. ‘I condemn in the strongest possible terms this serious violation of international law by Israeli forces,’ he said last night.

The front wall of the classroom was blown out, leaving debris and bloodied clothing all over the floor . Israel claimed that mortar shells had been fired from near the school, and that its soldiers fired back. ‘Five Israeli tank shells struck the people and killed many of them as they slept,’ added Khalil al-Halabi, director of UNRWA’s northern Gaza operations. ‘Those people came to the school because it is a designated UN shelter.’ Assad Sabah said he and his five children were huddling under desks in one of the classrooms because of the constant sound of tank fire throughout the night. ‘We were scared to death,’ he said. ‘After 4.30am, tanks started firing more. Three explosions shook the school. One classroom collapsed over the head of the people who were inside.’ The front wall of the classroom was blown out, leaving debris and bloodied clothing.

The money will provide emergency food for more than 300,000 people for one month and brings to £10million the amount released to help Gaza since the crisis began. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘After more than three weeks, the death toll in Gaza is rising and more than 200,000 people, many of them children, have been displaced from their homes.

"As millions make their way to Mecca for the annual hajj - a religious journey that is viewed as one of the Muslim faith's greatest acts of worship - there are fears that a deadly virus could break out. With so many people gathering at the Grand Mosque, it is claimed that it could become a breeding ground for the debilitating Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The potentially lethal disease has been linked to camels, which can be slaughtered as part of a sacrifice for Hajj. The Grand Mosque, the focal point of Islam, is already teeming with visitors wearing the simple white folds of cloth prescribed for Hajj . There are fears that the combination of so many people combined with the slaughtering of camels, which have been linked to the disease, could increase chances of an outbreak. Since April 2012 cases and outbreaks of the respiratory disease syndrome have been reported in people who live in or travelled from countries in the Middle East, the World Heath Organisation said. The fatality rate has been high, at about 60 per cent, the WHO reported. A study into the link between camels and Mers was published in The Lancet after scientists found traces of antibodies against the Mers virus in dromedary camels, but not the virus itself, The National reported. The Grand Mosque, the focal point of Islam, is already teeming with visitors wearing the simple white folds of cloth prescribed for Hajj. There are fears that the combination of so many people combined with the slaughtering of camels, which have been linked to the disease, could increase chances  of an outbreak . Almost two million people have so far arrived at the site in Saudi Arabia for the rites and another million are expected. Hajj must be performed at least once in their lifetime by all Muslims capable of making the expensive, difficult journey - a duty that applies equally to Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims at a time of tension between Islam's main sects. Health authorities around the world have warned unwell people to avoid the trip to Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Public Health England (PHE) and the National Travel Health Network and Centre said those wishing to travel should check the latest health advice following cases of respiratory illness caused by MERS-CoV. In July, elderly Muslims were told not to take part in the annual pilgrimage to Mecca because of the Sars-like virus. Pregnant . women, children under the age of 12, or people who suffer from chronic . illnesses should also abstain, according to advice from the Ministry of . Health in Saudi Arabia. Almost two million people have so far arrived at the site in Saudi Arabia for the rites and another million are expected . Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at PHE, said today: 'The potential for spread of infectious diseases associated with mass gatherings is well recognised. 'Hajj, the annual mass gathering of over three million Muslims from all over the world, presents challenges every year, but particularly this year as we are continuing to receive reports of cases of MERS in the region.' Dr Shuja Shafi, deputy secretary general at the Muslim Council of Britain, said thousands from the UK were expected to make the journey. He said: 'Advice issued by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health recommended that the elderly, those with chronic diseases, pregnant women and children postpone the performance of the Hajj for their own health and safety. 'People who have decided to go on Hajj this year and are unwell before travelling are being advised not to travel.' Dr Dipti Patel, joint director of the National Travel Health Network and Centre, said: 'While there are no travel restrictions to the Middle East and the risk to travellers remains very low, the Saudi Arabian ministry of health has advised vulnerable people and children who may have been planning to travel to the Middle East to perform the Hajj to postpone their pilgrimage for their own health and safety. 'Other people should continue with their plans but follow the specific guidance on the Hajj and other general advice about staying safe and healthy when travelling, including practising good personal hygiene. 'It's very important that anyone who does become ill while making the pilgrimage urgently reports to the health authorities, so they can receive appropriate treatment and avoid spreading illness to others.' In May, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said MERS-CoV is a 'threat to the entire world' and the disease is 'emerging faster than our understanding'. Three people have died in the UK as a result of the infection - including one man who died at the end of June.","Millions have made their way to Mecca for the annual Hajj pilgrimage .

"Mountains of rubbish are piling up in the Spanish city of Seville after a strike by binmen reached its tenth day. Rubbish collectors are protesting at proposed cuts to their working conditions as the Andalusian city's municipal government battles to balance its books. So far around 6,000 tons of rubbish have been left uncollected since the strike started.

'It's clear that striking can have a . much larger impact when it concerns something as visible to citizens as . garbage,' said Ángel Gallego Morales, the president of the economic and . social council of Andalusia, the regional body that oversees relations . among the government, companies and unions. 'We can only hope that this will soon end, even if there is no sign of any willingness to compromise right now.' More recently, the garbage problem . has even taken on a criminal dimension, as containers have been set on . fire. The fires have occurred mostly in the city's southern districts, . far from the historic downtown, the New York Times reported. Antonio Bazo, the president of the . workers' committee of Lipasam, condemned the fires as criminal acts of . delinquency and denied that employees of his company were responsible . for any of them. Around 6,000 tonnes of rubbish have been left uncollected on Seville's streets since the strike started . A dog walks alongside a road filled with overflowing garbage as the strike enters its second week . The management of Lipasam, Seville's munipical street cleaning company, rejected a plan proposed by the city council to reduce the garbage collectors' wages by five per cent while increasing their working hours . Workers are striking over demands they take a five per cent pay cut and extent their working week to 37.5 hours . 'We're not burning containers because . what we want is exactly the opposite, which is that the rubbish be seen . in the streets,' Mr. Bazo told the Europa Press news agency. Under Spanish employment law, Lipasam . has to guarantee that 30 per cent of the normal quantity of garbage is . collected even during a strike, particularly around hygiene-sensitive . areas like hospitals and slaughterhouses. City officials have also ensured that waste does not pile up around Seville's cathedral, the city's main tourist draw. Over the past three months, similar strikes by garbage collectors also occurred in Jérez de la Frontera and Granada, two of Andalusia¿s other large tourist cities . The strike started when the management of Lipasam, Seville's municipal street cleaning company, rejected a plan by the city council to reduce the garbage collectors' wages by five per cent while increasing their working hours . Piling up: A pedestrian passes a mountain of rubbish bags as the city's rubbish mountain rises . However, rubbish containers are . already overflowing in some of the other popular parts of the city, . including around the Alameda Square. Spain welcomed 57.9 million foreign . tourists last year, three per cent more than in 2011 and close to the . record 58.7 million visitors in 2007, before the financial crisis and . the bursting of Spain's construction bubble. Tourism has been one of the few sectors of Spain's economy to emerge relatively unscathed from the crisis. A street has become a makeshift bin as more and more bags pile up in the city centre .

Spain’s Prime Minister is facing increasing calls to quit as a corruption scandal engulfs his government. Mariano Rajoy is fighting for his political future after El Pais newspaper claimed the Popular Party leader received secret annual payments averaging €25,000 (£22,000) between 1997 and 2008. The cash allegedly came from a slush fund, run by former party treasurer Luis Barcenas, who reportedly received millions of Euros in illegal payments from firms bidding for contracts. It is an allegation Rajoy strenuously denies. Protesters yesterday jeered at Barcenas as he left prosecutors’ offices where he was questioned. People shouted 'thief' and 'give the money back' at Luis Barcenas as he left the anti-corruption prosecutors’ office Wednesday. The story has unnerved financial markets - with investors worried that a change in leadership would render Spain unable to address its considerable debts. This had led to the Government’s borrowing costs being pushed back up at a time when it is trying to save money and pay off its debts to avoid bankruptcy. As the 17-nation eurozone’s fourth largest economy, Spain is seen as being too large to bail out - unlike the smaller economies of Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Therefore, analysts fear a failure to pay off its debts could collapse the eurozone as a whole. The allegations have also sparked further civil unrest in the country with Spaniards, already bitter over enduring the painful austerity measures, taking to the streets in their thousands to show their anger. Protests against Rajoy at the weekend in Madrid, Barcelona and Seville turned violent as clashes erupted with police. A petition calling for Rajoy’s resignation has been signed by more than 900,000 people, and opinion polls claim a staggering 85 per cent of the nation now has ‘little faith’ in him. It comes as unemployment figures rose again to 26 per cent this week, with an astonishing 55 per cent of young people out of work, and experts predict that worse is yet to come. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, leader of the socialist opposition, has joined in the calls for Rajoy, who was elected in 2011, to quit for the ‘good of the country’. He said: ‘Rather than the solution for this country, Rajoy has become yet another problem. He should give up his role as the head of the government and cede his place to another leader because he cannot tackle the very difficult situation confronting Spain.’ The scandal first erupted last week when El Pais published what it claims were handwritten excerpts from Barcenas’ accounting books. They appear to show a regular distribution of under-the-table cash payments to a host of senior party members, including Rajoy. Rajoy, speaking on Saturday, categorically denied the claims by saying ‘I have never received nor distributed undeclared money’ and promised to publish details of his income online. Sources close to the leadership claim Rajoy has been a victim of a ‘smear campaign’ and that the documents had been doctored. The PP has also revealed it will take legal action, but its exact nature has not yet been disclosed. Barcenas, who is under separate investigation after it was revealed he had amassed €29million(£25million) in a secret Swiss bank account, also denies the claims.","Rubbish collectors are protesting against plan to reduce their wages by 5% while increasing their working hours .

"David Attenborough is accused of not covering homosexuality in the animal kingdom . Gay rights campaigners were delighted when the Commons approved same-sex marriage this week. But it appears there is another fight on the horizon – for equality in Sir David Attenborough’s nature documentaries. An academic has criticised the BBC star for failing to cover homosexuality in the animal kingdom. Dr Brett Mills, head of media studies at the University of East Anglia, said that while he doubted Sir David was deliberately ignoring the issues, homosexuality is ‘pretty much everywhere’ in the animal world. He said that by ignoring or sidelining the issue, wildlife documentary makers are skewing the audience’s view of what is natural. Dr Mills – who has previously criticised such documentaries for invading animals’ rights to privacy – said: ‘These programmes make a valuable contribution to environmental awareness and how people think about the world around them. They are highly regarded and educational but they should also be offering alternative interpretations of animal behaviour. ‘The central role in documentary stories of pairing, mating and raising offspring commonly rests on assumptions of heterosexuality within the animal kingdom. ‘This is despite a wealth of scientific evidence which demonstrates that many non-human species have complex and changeable forms of sexual activity, with heterosexuality only one of the many possible options.’ Dr Mills’s criticisms come after watching hours of Sir David’s documentaries, spanning two decades. In one example from 2003’s The Life Of Mammals, two male chimps are shown embracing. The narrator describes it as an act of friendly affection – but Dr Mills says alternative explanations should also be given. Dr Brett Mills, head of media studies at the University of East Anglia, . said that while he doubted Sir David was deliberately ignoring the . issues, homosexuality is 'pretty much everywhere' in the animal world . In The Life Of Birds in 1998, viewers were treated to male sandpipers circling one another in an ‘aggressive’ manner. Again, Dr Mills suggests another interpretation should have been addressed by the programme. The academic also complains that Sir David’s programmes place too much emphasis on traditional family values and monogamy while ignoring promiscuity and single parenting, which are also rife among many animals. He highlighted footage of emperor penguins from 1993 that suggests ‘family is an essential unit for the success of the offspring’. Similarly, the description of blue manakins, South American birds which have multiple mates, as ‘neglectful of their parental duties’ feeds the idea that one type of family is better than others, it is claimed. The researcher chose Sir David’s documentaries to illustrate his point because of the ‘perceived authority and reverence’ lent to them by the veteran broadcaster – but he stressed that other wildlife documentaries are just as guilty. Dr Mills, who airs his arguments in the European Journal of Clinical Studies, said: ‘The research now suggests that [homosexual] behaviour can be found in pretty much every species to different extents. ‘Anywhere people have actually looked, it will be found.’ The BBC did not respond to requests for comment. attenborough pg 15.jpg .","Homosexuality in animal world 'pretty much everywhere'

"A pregnant woman went into labor early and her young children were rushed to hospital after accidentally eating LSD in steak bought from a Florida WalMart. Jessica Rosado had to have her labor induced on Monday night after the 31-year-old and her family fell ill and started hallucinating after dinner. The WalMart store that supplied the bottom round steak has turned over all its meat for testing as police begin an investigation. Scroll down for video . Investigation: The Florida branch of WalMart where the allegedly contaminated steak was bought is checking surveillance footage for suspicious activity . Ms Rosasdo had been driving her boyfriend, Ronnie Morales, to St Joseph's Hospital when she started to also feel unwell on Monday night. By the time they reached the hospital her two children, Elyana, 7, and Rayna, 6, had started to hallucinate. Mr Morales and the children were given emergency treatment, including a tracheal intubation - where a tube is inserted in the windpipe to keep the airways clear. Ms Rosasdo, who was nine months' pregnant, had her labor induced and later gave birth to a healthy boy. She was able to return home with her son on Thursday. Tampa police chief Jane Castor said: 'There was no indication that we know of right now that the meat tasted funny.' 'It was the physical symptoms they had, which included hallucinations, dizziness, rapid heart rate and difficulty breathing.' She added: 'The family has no idea where this may have come from and there's no indication of any involvement on the part of the family.' Investigation: Tampa Police Chief Jane Castor says the family started to hallucinate after dinner . Dinner shock: The family fell ill after eating steak that appears to have been laced with LSD . Ms Rosado had been cooking dinner for the first time in the couple's new home, which they had moved into two days earlier. Tampa police say the family bought the steak from a WalMart on North Dale Mabry Highway. The store has co-operated with the investigation and voluntarily handed over remaining meat on its shelves. It is not yet clear how or when the steak became contaminated. Tests on Friday showed the steak and its packaging had traces of LSD. The Medical Examiner is currently testing that meat and police say no other cases have been reported so far. WalMart issued a statement to the Tampa Bay Times, saying it was 'deeply disturbed' by the incident. 'It's unclear where and how the food was tampered with or if the tampering occurred after purchase. However, out of an abundance of caution, we have pulled the remaining product from the store,' a spokesman for the chain said. Emergency: Jessica Rosado and her family were rushed to St Joseph's Hospital after falling sick and hallucinating . 'We have been in touch with our supplier and they tell us they have no reports of similar incidents. We are also reviewing our store's surveillance video to see if we can find any information that might assist in the investigation. At this point, we're not aware of any suspicious activity.' Forensic investigators have taken leftovers from the dinner and the family's oven to test for drugs. Initial results from Hillsborough County Medical Examiner's Office showed the family had all consumed steak contaminated with LSD. Toxicology test results from samples taken from the family are expected in three weeks.","Florida family suffered hallucinations after eating steak dinner .

"Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko dissolved parliament and called for elections to be held on October 26 . The Ukrainian president last night dissolved parliament in the wake of a fresh Russian incursion into the country. Petro Poroshenko called for elections to be held on October 26, noting that the ruling coalition collapsed several weeks ago. He added that the move was in line with the Ukrainian constitution. According to a Russian official, a column of Russian tanks crossed into the south-east of Ukraine around dawn yesterday, bringing the conflict to an area which has so far escaped the worst of the fighting. The news came as it emerged that thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the bloodshed are being sent to Siberia. Around 730,000 have left Ukraine since the start of the conflict, according to the United Nations. The Siberian Times reported 600 displaced people had been put on trains to the Siberian city Irkutsk, with another 930 expected to follow. Other groups were taken to western Siberia and the Urals.

"A hi-tech ‘glowstick’ has created some of the most astonishing light paintings ever seen - and is set to go on sale so anyone can make their own. The pixelstick, created by New York team Bitbanger Labs, has become a huge success just days after launching on Kickstarter. The $300 (£186) stick has 198 LED lights controlled by an on board computer. Scroll down for video . The pixelstick, used to create this image, was created by New York team Bitbanger Labs. It has become a huge success just days after launching on Kickstarter . Pixelstick consists of 198 full color RGB LEDs inside a lightweight aluminum housing. Pixelstick’s brain, a small mounted box, reads images from an SD card and displays them, one line at a time. Each LED corresponds to a single pixel in the image. The images themselves can be from one to 198 pixels tall and many thousands of pixels wide. Light painting is a photographic technique in which exposures are made by moving a hand-held light source, such as the pixelstick, through the air. It can also be created by moving the camera through the air. The technique requires a slow shutter speed, usually a second or more. 'Lightpainting involves thinking creatively and trying outlandish ideas in the pursuit of amazing pictures,' its creators say. 'Pixelstick broadens the horizon of what's possible.' The stick can use images created in software such as Photoshop, and can even create animations using multiple exposures. The stick has already raised over $275,000  via crowdfunding site Kickstarter and its creators, Duncan Frazier and Stephen McGuigan say they have been astonished by the response.

"A Kansas man had to have all ten of his toes amputated after he walked for an hour in the snow wearing dress shoes - and he will now have to learn to walk again. Evan Harter, 22, from Plattsburg, battled home through Arctic conditions last December after his car broke down wearing clothing best suited for a dinner party – and paid the price. He went to bed while wearing his wet socks and woke up to purple ankles and feet. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lesson learnt: Evan Harter had to have all his toes amputated after walking home in the snow in dress shoes . He told KCTV: ‘It took me about an hour to walk home. I was wearing dress slippers, a nice shirt, a jacket, long underwear, no gloves and actually no hat. ‘My feet were purple from the ankle all the way to the toes.’ Harter’s fingernails had also turned black. He told KMBC that he'd walked home from the centre of Plattsburg after attending a party - a distance of about two miles. Dr Richard Korentager, of the University of Kansas Hospital, said: 'It's a lifetime of challenges. He should be very functional, and that's our goal. There are things he is going to have to deal with, but it is going to be a long road for him.' Needless to say, Harter can clearly see now that he should have wrapped up properly. Pain: Harter's fingers were also badly affected by the frostbite . He added: ‘Always keep extra clothes in your car definitely no matter what.’ Frostbite strikes during temperatures below minus 0.55ºC (31ºF) and can affect any part of the body, though it's normally the extremities such as hands, feet, ears, nose and lips, that suffer, according to the UK's NHS website. The first symptoms are tissue and skin feeling cold and painful, followed by pins and needles and then numbness.","Evan Harter walked for an hour in the snow in formal shoes, went to bed wearing wet socks - and woke up with purple feet .

"A British man was killed when the pilot of a light aircraft - who was banned from flying commercially - suffered an epileptic fit and crashed from 10,000ft into the Pacific Ocean. Ian Lovell, 35, had been enjoying the holiday of a lifetime with his Australian girlfriend, Samantha Hare, 32, when the tragedy struck off the Australian coast in 2008. Ms Hare had bought the breathtaking flight across picturesque Morton Bay and Stradbroke Island in  Queensland as a birthday present for her boyfriend. Gift: Samantha Hare (left) had bought the flight for boyfriend Ian Lovell's (right) birthday just six days before . Killer flight: Mr Lovell was pictured here for the last time just minutes before the plane took off . What she did not know was that the pilot of the $492 flight, 60-year-old Barry Hempel, who also died in the incident, had been stripped of his commercial license after breaching a string of aviation rules in 2001. An inquest at Queensland Coroner's Court Friday heard that Hempel had continued to fly his own private aircraft despite the commercial ban. It emerged during the hearing that Hempel was known to Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority as suffering from epileptic fits, but they allowed him to keep his private pilot's license regardless. On August 31, 2008 - six days after turning 35 - Mr Lovell climbed on board the two-seater aircraft with Hempel. Dream trip: Ian Lovell had been enjoying the holiday of a lifetime before tragedy struck . But 13 minutes into the flight Hempel suffered an epileptic fit in the cockpit and plunged the Yak-52 Warbird into the Pacific Ocean. A horrified Ms Hare watched the drama from the shoreline. Brisbane Coroner John Hutton slammed the Civil Aviation Authority and said it was 'unbelievable' that Hempel was still allowed to keep his private license. He said: 'It is unbelievable that CASA did not act. 'Queensland Ambulance Service's report ought to have put CASA on red alert as to Barry Hempel’s ability to fly. 'It is also unbelievable that when Dr Ian Maxwell was briefed to assess Barry Hempel, a copy of this report was never provided to him, nor was he advised as to the admissions as to two previous seizures. 'During the inquest it became obvious that CASA medical officers were cavalier in respect to the reports and CASA medical officers chose to disregard the observations of trained paramedics.' The court heard Hempel had not reported any problem to air traffic control but a frantic Ian could be shouting to the lifeless pilot in the last cockpit recording. In the accidentally transmitted message an extremely upset Mr Lovell can be heard saying: 'Oh my god, what are you doing? Put it up.' Medical evidence showed that Hempel died from injuries caused by the impact itself but had not braced himself before hitting the water, suggesting he was unconscious. An autopsy found there was 'gross evidence' that Hempel, a pilot of 40 years, had a prior injury and scarring which could cause seizures. As his commercial, transport and commercial helicopter licence had been cancelled this meant he was not allowed to take paying customers in the air. After the hearing, Mr Lovell's mother . Lynn, 59, said the coroner’s report had brought the family closure after . five years of campaigning. Close: Ian Lovell's family were left devastated by the crash. He is Pictured here with sister Becky . Speaking from the family home she shares with husband David, 62, in Shifnal, Shropshire, she said: 'It’s something that should never, ever have happened. Something has got to happen, this can’t happen to another family. 'Hempel had no regard for anybody. He was a maverick, a cowboy and a liar - everything you wouldn’t want to know in a person. 'Sam bought the ticket along with Ian’s friend. They thought it would be something he would like to do. 'He wasn’t a daredevil. He knew that Sam had researched the flight. He didn’t go into things lightly. 'The register is the one thing that really needs chasing up. Sam will pursue that and make sure something is being done. 'She is angry at CASA. We are angry at CASA.' Angry: Lynn and David Lovell from Shifnal in Shropshire, look at photographs of beloved son, Ian . Girlfriend Samantha - who is suing the two CASA doctors responsible for medically clearing Hempel for $955,000 - added: 'None of this brings Ian back. Recommendations can be put forward but Ian is gone. 'I’m angry really. When it comes down to it CASA is the regulatory body and they did nothing to stop Barry from flying. 'I think there needs to be a better way for people to be able to check what kind of licences pilots hold. 'What he did in flying Ian was illegal and he had had his commercial licence suspended but CASA actually gave him the freedom.' Mr Lovell had been working in Australia following his dream of combining travel with his work as a computer games animator. He had just completed his most high-profile project, working for Chrome Industries on the Star Wars computer game, before he died. A spokesman for CASA said the organisation would 'carefully be considering' the recommendations.

"A Muslim cable channel has been dropped by Verizon a year after the owner of the station was given life in prison for beheading his wife at their TV studio. Bridges TV will go off air on March 14, almost a year to the day after the channel's owner Muzzammil Hassan, 47, was jailed for the brutal murder of his wife Aasiya, who was also the station manager. Mrs Hassan had told her abusive husband that she was leaving him in 2009 and asked for a divorce. Six days later he lured her to their office in Buffalo, New York where he stabbed her 40 times and hacked off her head with two hunting knives. Life in prison: Muzzammil Hassan was sentenced to life in prison in Buffalo, New York after he brutally stabbed then decapitated his wife in 2009 . The couple had two children Danyal, nine and seven-year-old Rania. Hassan, a former banker, was convicted of second-degree murder in 2011 for stabbing and beheading his 37-year-old wife. He received the maximum sentence of 25 years to life in jail. The Verizon network claimed that dropping the channel was unrelated to the brutal murder, putting the decision down to low viewership figures. Samantha Azzar, news anchor at Bridges TV told wgrz.com: 'Without Verizon, we will cease to exist. Beheaded: Aasiya Hassan was murdered by her husband after she said that she would divorce him . 'There will be no voice for local Muslim Americans to cover stories that are important to them.' The station has posted a notice on its website asking supporters to complain to Verizon about getting rid of Bridges TV. Muzzammil Hassan started the station in 2004 and lists as one of its values to 'thrive on innovation and originality, encouraging risk-taking and divergent voices'.

"David Pedersen who murdered four people in 2011 was treated to a lavish meal in an Oregon prison after he cooperated and admitted his guilt in the last two killings . A white supremacist killer who went on a nine-day spree which left four people dead was treated to a slap-up meal as a 'thank-you' from the state attorney's office for pleading guilty in an alleged bungled case. David 'Joey' Pedersen was arrested in 2011 following the murders of his father and stepmother, an Oregon teenager and a California man. He pleaded guilty in 2012 in Washington state to murdering his father David 'Red' Pedersen and stepmother Leslie 'Dee Dee' Pedersen and was sentenced to life in prison. However, he had not pleaded guilty to the carjacking murders of Reginald Clark, 53, or 19-year-old Cody Myers. It was reported by The Oregonian that the case had many problems, including missing evidence. The paper revealed on Sunday that in May, Pedersen had been allowed to enjoy a homemade feast of salmon and greens before a cheese plate and dessert during the meal with his defense team. News of the meal caused much anger among prison employees, The Oregonian reported. The lavish meal appears to be part of an agreement reached with Pedersen by the prosecution. Days before Pedersen sat down to the feast, he pleaded guilty to the murders of Reginald Clark and Cody Myers in exchange for the meal and  shortening of the sentence of one of his friends who gave him a gun, according to The Oregonian. The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to MailOnline today that Pedersen's meal had taken place inside the jail. It is unclear who paid for Pedersen's meal as his defense attorneys brought the food in with them during their scheduled client meeting. A public spokesman told MailOnline today: 'It [the food] was examined for safety and security reasons prior to entering. 'It did not break a jail rule as the items were authorized to be brought in with the defense attorney and investigators for the meeting.' He said that individual requests are considered on a case by case basis and it is not a common for a prisoner to be allowed an a la carte meal. The spokesman was unclear if such a meal had been allowed before at the jail. Pedersen was sentenced to life in prison today for the murders of Mr Clark, 53, and 19-year-old college student Mr Myers. The killer told those in the Portland federal courtroom that Monday's sentencing was 'rather anti-climactic,' because he had already been sentenced to life in prison in Washington state for the deaths of his father and stepmother. Pedersen made a lengthy statement to the court in which he blasted police, prosecutors and American foreign policy. He had already been sentenced to life in prison for killing his father and stepmother. His sister, Holly Perez, shouted at him to 'shut up'. MailOnline was awaiting for a response from the U.S. Attorney's office in Oregon. However Pedersen's defense attorney Richard Wolf told The Oregonian: 'How badly did the U.S. Attorney's Office have to screw up the case to the point they allowed us to have a meal with our client?' Joey Pedersen's father, Red Pedersen (left), was shot in the back of the head, while his stepmother, Dee Dee (right), was slashed with dull knives and left to die from blood loss . Pedersen recently pled guilty to to the carjacking murders of Reginald Clark (pictured left) and Cody Myers (right) in exchange for a lavish meal with his defense team and a reduction in sentence for a friend who gave him a gun. Pedersen was sentenced to life in prison today . Defense attorney Mr Wolf told The Oregonian that Pedersen had read about one of his previous clients, killer Tremayne Durham, who received a meal of fried chicken, pizza and ice-cream in exchange for a guilty plea in 2008. In April, allegations about the mishandling of the murder case came to light in court during arguments between the defense and prosecution. There were claims that crime scene evidence had disappeared and Pedersen's rights as a prisoner had been violated. Pedersen shot his father in the back of the head while the elder man was driving on September 26, 2011. Red Pedersen moved and moaned for at least 30 minutes before dying, prosecutors said. Joey Pedersen believed that his father deserved to die because he had allegedy molested one of his daughters, rendering him a degenerate unworthy of the white race in his son's eyes, according to court documents. Pedersen is the founder of a white supremacist prison gang, and told girlfriend Holly Grigsby about his desire to start a revolution with a killing rampage targeting Jewish leaders. Pedersen, along with his sympathizer Grigsby, 27, then returned to the family home. Dee Dee Pedersen was bound with duct tape, slashed in the neck with a pair of dull knives and left to bleed to death. Holly Grigsby, left, pictured in 2011 looking at her boyfriend, David Pedersen. Both were sentenced to life in prison for the killing spree . 'Animals are treated more humanely going to slaughter than your victims were,' said Holly Perez, the daughter of Red Pedersen and sister of the murderer at the time of his 2012 sentencing. The couple then drove Red Pedersen's vehicle south into Oregon, where they shot and killed 19-year-old Oregon college student Mr Myers and stole his car, authorities said. They shot Mr Myers, who was Christian, because his name sounded Jewish, according to court documents. Grigsby would later tell police they did not want any witnesses, and they regarded Mr Myers as a 'casualty of war'. Pedersen and Grigsby then headed to northern California, where Mr Clark, a 53-year-old black man, was shot dead after he offered them a ride. The persecutors wrote in court documents, cited by The Oregonian, that the pair viewed Clark not only as a potential witness who had to be neutralized, but also as a 'Negro degenerate'. Grigsby and Pedersen were arrested October 5, 2011, outside Yuba City, California, when a police officer spotted them in Myers' car. Grigsby told officers they were on their way to Sacramento to 'kill more Jews,' court documents said.","David Pedersen was sentenced to life in prison today for the murders of Reginald Clark, 53, and 19-year-old Cody Myers .

"Speaking out: Professor Lennart Bengtsson . A leading academic says activists are trying to block scientific reports that question the dangers of climate change. Professor Lennart Bengtsson said he had been subjected to ‘unbearable’ pressure from other researchers and warned of the increasing politicisation of the once ‘peaceful’ science. Others described a ‘poisonous atmosphere’ in which researchers plot behind the scenes to block the publication of work that queries the danger posed by climate change. Prof Bengtsson, a top meteorologist attached to Reading University, spoke out after some of his research was rejected by a leading scientific journal. His study suggested carbon dioxide may be less damaging to the planet than feared – effectively challenging the political consensus and the urgency of the taxpayer-funded drive towards green energy. An unnamed academic who was asked to help decide if the paper should be published, denounced it as ‘harmful’. The reviewer also warned it would generate bad  publicity and have a ‘high’ but ‘strongly negative’ impact on the field of climate change science. Prof Bengtsson said having research rejected was ‘part and parcel of academic life’, but added that it would be  ‘utterly unacceptable’ for an academic to advise against publishing a paper on the grounds that it might bolster the views of climate sceptics. He told the Times: ‘It is an indication of how science is gradually being influenced by political views. The problem we now have in the climate community is that some scientists are mixing up their scientific role with that of climate activist. ‘The reality hasn’t been keeping up with the [computer] models. Therefore, if people are proposing to do major changes to the world’s economic system, we must have much more solid information.’ However, the publisher of the Environmental Research Letters journal said the study contained errors and did not meet its criteria of contributing significant new knowledge. Prof Bengtsson’s remarks came just days after he resigned from the advisory board of a think-tank that questions the amount of money being poured into combating climate change, after being subject to a ‘witch-hunt’ by fellow academics. The 79-year-old said the pressure had become ‘virtually unbearable’ and made him fear for his health and safety. Prof Bengtsson, a top meteorologist attached to Reading University, spoke out after some of his research was rejected by a leading scientific journal . In his letter of resignation to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, he said: ‘I would never have expected anything similar in such an original peaceful community as meteorology. Apparently it has been transformed in recent years.’ Benny Peiser, of the GWPF, said the professor’s case was just one example of a ‘poisonous atmosphere’ pervading climate change research. He said many scientists with dissenting views were having their research rejected by the editors of scientific journals, and young scientists were censoring their work out of fear for their careers. Dr Peiser said: ‘Over the last few years, the editors of many of the world’s leading science journals have publicly advocated drastic policies to curb carbon dioxide emissions. At the same time, many have publicly attacked scientists sceptical of the climate alarm. ‘Instead of serving as open-minded broker of the contested fields of climate science and climate science, most science editors have opted to take a dogmatic stance that no longer allows for open research.’ David Gee, an emeritus professor at Uppsala University in Sweden, said the pressure on Prof Bengtsson ‘simply confirms the worst aspects of politicised science’. The Institute of Physics, which publishes Environmental Research Letters, said the decision to not publish Prof Bengtsson was based solely on the paper not meeting the journal’s high standards. Editorial director Nicola Gulley said: ‘Far from hounding “dissenting” views from the field, Environmental Research Letters positively encourages genuine scientific innovation that can shed light on complicated climate science.’","Professor Bengtsson's research suggested carbon dioxide may be less damaging to the planet than feared .

"Disgraced former Army General David Petraeus reportedly tried to stop a heroic soldier from receiving the Medal of Honor after he fought off 60 Taliban fighters almost single-handedly for seven hours. Retired Captain William Swenson was awarded the nation's highest honor in October for the 2009 action, but it has now been revealed that Petraeus made calls to have his award downgraded. A new Pentagon investigation revealed that before his extra marital affair and ensuing resignation, Petraeus suggested that Swenson receive the Distinguished Service Cross rather than the Medal of Honor- effectively bumping his award down to the most prestigious to the second highest award. Retired Captain William Swenson has spoken of his anger that repeated requests for backup during his seven hour ordeal were ignored by his commanders back at base . Humble: President Barack Obama shakes hands with former Army Captain William D. Swenson of Seattle, Wash., after he awarded him the Medal of Honor during a ceremony in the East Room at the White House in Washington . McClatchy reports that the inquiry does not specifically name Petraeus but it refers to the 'former commander, USFOR-A,' which was his title at the time in question. Another murky finding is that Swenson's file that was submitted to the President as part of the Medal of Honor confirmation process was not his original file. For some unknown reason, Swenson's original file had been swiped clean and the one that was submitted to the President was a duplicate file. It is believed that Petraeus pushed to have Swenson's award downgraded came after he made repeated complaints to military-higher ups because his calls for back up when a group of Taliban soldiers cornered his group went unanswered for seven hours. As a result of Swenson's complaints, two Army officers were reprimanded for being 'inadequate and ineffective'. Hero: Capt. William Swenson left the army in Feb 2011 but announced that Tuesday that he would like to return . Swenson believed the judgment of the officers who denied his calls for fire support had been clouded by pressure from headquarters in Kabul, at the time headed by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, to restrict the use of artillery in an effort to reduce civilian casualties. Now Swenson thinks that the military has failed him once more by not specifically naming an individual who has to take responsibility for the botched four-year nomination process. Under fire: Former Army General David Petraeus pushed to have Swenson's honor downgraded to the second-most prestigious award . 'An institution can’t heal itself unless it can identify what its weaknesses are, and its weaknesses in this case is an individual,' Swenson told McClatchy. 'The investigation failed to meet the standard of a military investigation in which individuals are identified. 'Behind every single institutional failure, there’s a name.' After the incident, Swenson decided to leave the Army in February 2011 but has now said he may be considering rejoining. The attack that earned Swenson, 34, his medal took place in Afghanistan's Ganjgal Valley when he took control when his . superior officer was injured. He ran through gun fire to rescue his . injured colleagues out in the exposed open - returning twice more to . what the military dubs the 'kill zone' to recover the wounded and the . dead. According to the official . military records of the attack, as mortar and AK-47 fire reigned down, . the roughly 106 men attached to Captain Swenson's group scattered as . they were ambushed from all sides and surrounded. The . column consisted of 106 personnel, which included 60 Afghan National . Army (ANA), 14 ANA mentors, 30 Afghan Border Police members, and U.S. Army Soldiers Capt. William Swenson and Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth . Westbrook. 'Swenson . observed enemy fighters to his east, swarming out from the high ground, . attempting to flank his position. He immediately returned fire, and . directed and coordinated the response of the ABP and ANA soldiers,' said . the official narrative from the Department of Defense. As . the fierce firefight between the Coalitin forces and the Taliban raged, . the calls of the wounded began to be heard as it became evident they . were surrounded. It . was during the confused first hours of the battle that Swenson learned . that his partner Sgt First Class Westbrook had been shot in the upper . chest and was lying exposed under attack from the Taliban.

"The extreme winter weather around the Great Lakes will cause Lake Superior to completely freeze over, an expert predicts. An estimated 91 per cent of its surface was covered in ice on February 6, the most recent measurement, according to the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. But Jay Austin, associate professor at the Large Lakes Observatory in Duluth, Minnesota, believes that the lake, which has a surface area of 31,700 square miles and is the largest freshwater lake in the world, will freeze over before the arrival of spring. Lake Superior has never had more than 91 per cent ice cover since records began . Ice one: Lake Superior will completely freeze over by the end of the winter, an expert predicts . Monitoring: The ice cover for the Great Lakes stood at 80 per cent as of February 2014 . The last total freeze-over was in 1997. However there is now more ice on the lake than then, as it is thicker in the areas that have frozen already. Its current ice cover equals the record set in 1994, but that is about to be smashed, according to Professor Austin. The 40-year average annual Lake Superior ice coverage for February is just 30 per cent. Prof Austin told CNS News that there’s a ‘very high likelihood’ that the lake will freeze in the imminent future, thanks to the longevity of this year’s extreme temperatures. Calm before the storm: Lake Superior, the largest of The Great Lakes system, is seen here before the winter storms hit . According to an analysis by NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, ice covered 78.7 percent of the Great Lakes on February 6. Not since early 1996 has ice been so widespread on the Great Lakes. Seen here is Lake Superior at 4.22 pm local time on February 7, 2014 . He pointed out that the mercury didn’t rise above zero in Duluth, which sits on the edge of Lake Superior, for 23 days in a row recently, breaking the 1936 record of 22 days. George Leshkevich, who has been tracking Great Lakes ice for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory since 1973, said this winter has had among the most rapid ice buildups of his tenure. Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world with a surface area of 31,700 square miles . Air temperatures show this is the coldest winter since 1979, according to Twin Cities. The widespread ice in January and early February this year 'wouldn't have been anomalous back in the '70s or with some of the winters in the mid-'90s'. 'But it certainly has been a while since we've seen this much ice this early,' Leshkevich said. The extent of the freeze comes despite warnings from scientists that climate change was causing the lake to become warmer. A study in 2007 suggested that the long-term trend was for higher air temperatures in summer over the lake, and less ice in winter on it.","The ice cover on Lake Superior currently stands at 91 per cent .

"Angry David Cameron has accused Ed Miliband of resorting to childish taunts about his posh background – as he described Labour as 'a complete shower'. The Prime Minister said Mr Miliband's 'personal abuse' did not bother him and insisted he was 'proud' of his privileged background. At last week's Labour conference, Mr Miliband accused the PM of being a 'PR man' for the rich. He said Mr Cameron only stood up for 'Conservative supporting, gold mining, luxury hotel owning, Putin award winning, Russian oligarchs'. But Mr Cameron said: 'There is quite an interesting difference - my argument about Ed Miliband is that he has not got a plan. That is substance. As far as I can see from his speech, he just had personal abuse. Well after nine years of being party leader, I can cope with personal abuse. It doesn't seem very grown-up.' Scroll down for video . David Cameron, at the Tory conference in Birmingham, told party supporters that Labour were a 'complete shower' Mr Cameron made clear the next election would be a direct choice between him and Ed Miliband . Mr Cameron, who was in the conference hall to watch George Osborne's speech, insisted he did not live a 'totally rarefied existence' He added: 'But at the end of the day, the election will be decided upon who has got the best plan, who is going to take the country forward. It is not about where I went to school.' Mr Cameron, 47, speaking to the Sun newspaper insisted he did not live a 'totally rarefied existence' – but said he was not going to pretend he was not posh. He said: 'You can't change who you are, and I am not going to change who I am. 'I can't change the school I went to, or the upbringing I had, or the parents I have - and nor would I want to.' Mr Cameron's anger with the Labour Party came to the surface at a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham last night. The PM, speaking to party activists, said the Labour Party was so poor it would be embarrassing not to beat them in May's general election. He said: 'We saw last week what we are up against, and I have to say, after that Labour leader's speech, after that Labour conference, if we, the Conservative Party, cannot defeat that complete shower of an opposition we don't deserve to be in politics.' The remarks echo Tony Blair's final conference speech as Labour leader, in which he said of the Tories: 'If we can't take this lot apart in the next few years we shouldn't be in the business of politics at all.' Ed Miliband's tried a similar tactic in his 2012 conference address, in which he asked: 'Have you ever seen a more incompetent, hopeless, out-of-touch, U-turning, pledge-breaking, make-it-up-as-you-go-along, back-of-the-envelope, miserable shower than this Prime Minister and this government?' Mr Cameron said 'personal insults' about his background did not bother him. But the Tory Party has targeted Ed Miliband as Labour's weak link . Labour leader Ed Miliband resorted to digs about Mr Cameron's background because he didn't have a 'plan' for the economy, Mr Cameron said . In his interview with the Sun, Mr Cameron said there were bits about him voters 'absolutely hate', but insisted not everyone was against him. He said: 'I think people have got to know me a bit. 'I am sure there are bits they like, bits they don't like.' But hae added: 'When I go round the country, you obviously get some good reactions you get some bad reactions. 'But generally people have a sense that the government is trying to do something, trying to sort things out.' He added: 'A lot of people shout 'Stick at it.' That is probably what I hear more than anything else.'","David Cameron says he is 'proud' of his posh background despite attacks .

"Sitting alone in her room on the 14th floor of a Chicago hospital, Sharon Hart needed some cheering up. A week earlier the 48-year-old was shocked to learn what she thought was the stomach flu was actually Acute Myloid Leukemia - blood cancer. She was subsequently rushed into chemotherapy and has been sick in hospital since. So when her 14-year-old son, William, called the phone in her room at the weekend, it was a case of great timing.

'I pulled up the window and it said 'Hi mom' with a smiley face and all.' Will and his father, Gary, were on their way inside Rush University Medical at the time when they drove to the roof to see the view of Chicago's skyline. What they found was an opportunity in the freshly-fallen snow. 'I just kind of thought, 'You know, it would be great to have my mom see this message.,' William told ABC Local. 'And so I started from there, and my dad was like, 'What are you doing?' And he joined in. I said, 'I'm saying hi to mom,' and we went on from there. ' Hannah Hart, William's older sister, said she can't believe how much attention the message - which went viral almost immediately - has received . William Hart has always been incredibly close with his mother, Sharon, who is now battling blood cancer . However, when the two left the hospital around 10pm that night, they could the faces of many patients looking down at them, and decided the gesture wasn't big enough. 'Dad had the idea to write Gold Bless You All,' said Hannah Hart, Will's older sister. 'But it couldn't fit, so it says God Bless You, but it's still something everybody could see.' It was a message that touched the hospital from top to bottom - literally. 'One of the other family members here said they had had goose bumps and that night went to bed crying about how special that was,' hospital nurse Maura Hoyt said. All gone: Sadly the carpark had to be plowed on Monday morning to make more space for parking, however apparently the plowers were reluctant to sweep away the message . 'It shows she raised an incredible young man and there is so much love in that family.'

"Polar ice sheets are now melting three times faster than they did in the 1990s, a 'definitive' study of satellite data has found. The amount of ice lost from Greenland and Antarctica is enough to raise world sea levels by almost one millimetre a year. Since 1992, it has added more than 1cm to global sea levels - contributing around a fifth of the total rise. About two thirds of the ice loss was from Greenland and the remainder from Antarctica, said scientists. Scroll down for video . Slippery slope: The image, taken in July, shows melt water rushing along the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet . A 60-foot-deep canyon has been carved out of this Greenland glacier over the course of several years by turbulent water overflow from a large melt lake . Until now, there has been confusion over what is happening to the ice sheets in a warming world. Estimates have differed greatly, with some studies even suggesting gains rather than losses. The new survey is said to be the most accurate assessment to date, ending 20 years of uncertainty.It confirms that, with the exception of East Antarctica, both land masses are losing ice. But big differences in the pace of change were seen at each pole. The new research concludes that . Antarctica is melting, but points to the smaller ice sheet in Greenland, . which covers most of the island, as the bigger and more pressing issue. Its melt rate has grown from about 55 billion tons a year in the 1990s . to almost 290 billion tons a year recently, according to the study. 'Greenland is really taking off,' said National Snow and Ice Data Center scientist Ted Scambos, a . co-author of the paper released Thursday by the journal Science. One of the biggest wild cards in . climate change has been figuring out how much the melting of the massive . sheets of ice at the two poles would add to the seas. Study leader Professor Andrew Shepherd, from the University of Leeds, said: 'The success of this venture is due to the co-operation of the international scientific community, and due to the provision of precise satellite sensors by our space agencies. An iceberg in or just outside the Ilulissat fjord, that likely broke off from Jakobshavn Isbrae, the fastest glacier in west Greenland . 'Without these efforts, we would not be in a position to tell people with confidence how the Earth's ice sheets have changed, and to end the uncertainty that has existed for many years.' Scientists blame man-made global . warming for the melting. Burning fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, . emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that trap heat, warming . the atmosphere and oceans. Bit-by-bit, that erodes the ice sheets from . above and below. Snowfall replenishes the ice sheets, but hasn't kept . pace with the rate of melting. Because the world's oceans are so . big, it takes a lot of ice melting - about 10 trillion tons - to raise . sea levels 1 inch (2.5 centimeters). Since 1992, ice sheets at the poles . have lost nearly 5 trillion tons of ice, the study says, raising sea . levels by about a half inch. That seemingly tiny extra bit . probably worsened the flooding from an already devastating Superstorm . Sandy last month, said NASA ice scientist Erik Ivins, another co-author . of the study. He said the extra weight gives each wave a little more . energy. 'The more energy there is in a wave, the further the water can get inland,' Ivins said. Globally, the world's oceans rose about half a foot (15 centimeters) on average in the 20th Century. Melting ice sheets accounts for about . one-fifth of sea level rise. Warmer water expands, contributing to the . rise along with water from melting glaciers outside the polar regions. The scientists matched results from 10 satellite observations employing three separate techniques to spot changes on the Earth. The aim was to reconcile differences between earlier studies. Care was taken to compare similar geographical regions, time periods, and models of ice sheet behaviour. Back in July this composite was released of NASA images showing the extent of surface melt on Greenland's ice sheet on July 8 (left) and July 12 (right) Rates of ice loss were calculated for Greenland, East Antarctica, West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. Although East Antarctica showed a net increase in ice mass, this was not enough to compensate for larger losses elsewhere. The research is published today in the journal Science. Commenting on the findings, Professor Richard Alley, a US climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said: 'This project is a spectacular achievement. The data will support essential testing of predictive models, and will lead to a better understanding of how sea-level change may depend on the human decisions that influence global temperatures.' The vast polar ice sheets lock up unimaginable amounts of water. The Antarctic ice sheet contains 30 million cubic kilometres of ice and holds around 90% of all the fresh water on the surface of the Earth. If the whole Antarctic ice sheet melted, sea levels would rise by more than 60 metres. The Greenland ice sheet is much smaller, but would add seven metres to sea levels if it all melted away. Just how much ice is melting at the two poles has been difficult for scientists to answer. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did not include ice sheet melt in its calculations of future sea level rise because numbers were so uncertain. NASA chief scientist Waleed Abdalati, one of the few top ice researchers who wasn't part of the study, praised the work. 'Understanding how and why the ice sheets are changing today better equips us for understanding and predicting how much and in what ways they will change in the future,' he said.",The amount of ice now lost from Greenland and Antarctica is enough to raise world sea levels by almost 1mm every year .
"A swan has been grounded for his own safety after falling head over heels in love with a helicopter. The bird - called Whooper - has developed an unusual attachment to the £6million chopper and tries to fly up to meet it every time it comes into land. Whooper has been looking for a new mate  for the past two years in the skies over Les Mielles Golf and Country Club on the Channel Island of Jersey after losing his partner. But instead of falling for a fellow bird he’s become obsessed with the dark-coloured Eurocopter that regularly lands at the adjacent airstrip. Scroll down for video . Unhealthy attraction: Whooper the swan flies around the Eurocopter EC155 helicopter he has fallen in love with after his mate died . Dedicated: Whooper is named after his species the whooper swan which normally pair for life . Dozens of different choppers fly in and out of the runway every week - but Whooper only has eyes for the EC155. Air traffic controllers at Jersey Airport say the infatuated swan recognises the five-tonne chopper’s twin-engines whenever it flies in. Whooper immediately takes to the skies to try and reach it before chasing it down the runway, then sitting and nestling by it until its owner flies off again. But the helicopter's pilot is so terrified the besotted bird - named after its species the whooper swan - will fly into its rotor blades they’ve been forced to clip his wings. Danielle Le Brun, who works at the golf club, said bosses had no option but to ground the swan. Lonely bird: Whooper has been looking for a new partner since his mate died two years ago . Looking for love: Whooper was often found nestling against the helicopter and soared into the air whenever he spotted it in the skies . He said: 'He lost his mate a couple of years ago and has been flying high around the area looking for a mate. 'Apparently he has taken a fancy to a helicopter up at the airport and so as responsible owners we decided to get his wings clipped by a vet. 'We have lots of other swans here but we don’t have any other whooper swans. 'He seems very happy but I would like to find him a female white swan - but this is Jersey and there aren’t many around. 'So if anyone can help me find him a mate that would be brilliant. It would also stop him flying around the airport when his feathers grown back.' The 200mph EC155 can carry up to 13 passengers along with two crew members and is normally used to ferry private passengers and VIPs. Neighbours: The Eurocopter EC155 helicopter is based at an airstrip opposite the golf and country club where Whooper is based . Grounded: Staff at the Les Mielles Golf and Country Club in Jersey were eventually forced to clip the wings of Whooper the swan for his own safety . The chopper’s owner is understood to be a wealthy businessman who lives on Guernsey and regularly hops between the two islands. A Jersey Airport spokesman confirmed that Whooper had created a potential hazard by 'flirting' with the incoming aircraft. He added: 'It seems that the swan fell in love with the helicopter, and as romantic as this may seem, it did create a potential hazard and so its wings were clipped. 'There has been no repeat incidents since this happened.' Whooper swans normally pair for life and are fiercely protective of their offspring. Weighing as much as 14 kg (31lsb) they are some of the animal world’s heaviest flyers and are revered as the national bird of Finland. Dr Glyn Young, a Jersey-based conservation biologist, who has been made aware of Whooper’s plight, said swans can occasionally do some 'very weird things'. He added: 'It certainly isn’t natural.'","The bird - called Whooper - has been looking for a new mate for two years .

"You don't have to wait until Thursday to see Marks and Spencer's new advert starring Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, David Gandy and Helena Bonham-Carter. Online viewers can get a sneak peek here of the festive fare, which has been inspired by some of our most loved fairy tales, before it's broadcast on TV. For the first time the brand is using . social media channels to debut its multimillion pound advert. The full two minute version, which you can view below, has been released on YouTube as well as the M&S website this evening. Leading ladies: Helen Bonham-Carter and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley star in the M&S Christmas ad . Online first: Rosie flaunts her curves in lingerie from her range as the advert is unveiled on the internet before airing on TV . Get the look: Rosie is seen in the M&S Collection Jumper, £45, left, at the start of the advert while her lingerie in the Arabian Nights scene is a bra, £25 and knickers £12.50 Autograph set with floral dressing gown, £69 . Behind the scenes footage and interviews with the stars are also online. Set to an enchanting orchestral . soundtrack, the ad is shot in a filmic style as it takes the viewers . into a world of 'magic and sparkle' from Alice in Wonderland to the . Wizard of Oz. Rosie- of course - the leading lady, is first seen . pursuing a pretty little dog across a city street before tumbling from . the real world through a manhole into a snow dusted enchanted forest, seated at a . fantastical feast. The ad . then follows the lingerie designer and model through a red riding house . scene, an Arabian Nights flight and finally a walk along the yellow . brick road, with a little help from the ever handsome David and a . bewitching Helena Bonham Carter, whose appearance is seen as a huge coup for the retailer. Wizard style: Helena wears twisted front dress, £45, and coat, £110, both Per Una . Magical entrance: After falling through a hole in the road when chasing her dog, Rosie makes a stylish crash-landing in the giant's new Christmas campaign .

David wears, from left: Autograph Jacket, £99, Autograph Dress Shirt £29.50 and Autograph Top Hat, £35 . The Daily Mail's Liz Jones - often the High Street's harshest critic - gave the ad a glowing review after she was given a peek on Sunday. She said: 'From my sneak preview, the ad is a triumph. But will other viewers agree? 'For . M&S’s vocal shareholders, this cannot just be a vanity project, an . escape for a few moments into fantasy. It has to make those cash . registers burst into song. 'This time, I think M&S has done . its homework, and pulled off quite a coup: while Bonham Carter is known . for her rather eccentric style of bird’s-nest hair and socks worn with . flip-flops, of late she has become something of a fashion icon. Seen here first: The retailer has released the multimillion pound advert online ahead of the full TV airing . Social media interaction: Online viewers will be able to vote for the name of Rosie's dog via Facebook or Twitter . 'Here, Helena makes a hilarious appearance in a fairytale that, although only two minutes long, cost many millions to produce. 'Teamed cleverly with Rosie, she’s a classy, . unexpected ingredient in a perfect mix that will appeal to Everywoman, . being neither too frumpy, nor too unattainable. 'The . product placement — dresses, dresses and more dresses — is perfect, and . there is nothing cheesy about the production, apart from the Cheddar . truckles at the tea party. It’s fun, and, given the chemistry between . Rosie and Gandy, super sexy. Rosie in Wonderland: In a £49.50 M&S Woman dress . Fairytale to shop floor: Rosie as Red Riding Hood wears Autograph Coat, £139 . Follow the yellow brick road: Rosie as Dorothy in a Limited Edition embellished white dress, £59, while David wears a £119 jacket and £37.50 cords as the scarecrow . 'Rosie . is a reliable cash cow (excuse the term) for Marks, with her own-label . lingerie selling more than any other brand in the store’s history. And . the chiselled features of David Gandy will keep mums, who will be the . ones lugging those Magic and Sparkle carrier bags home, very happy . indeed.' The brand will be hoping the Christmas offering will boost sales after it was reported that their Autumn 'leading ladies' campaign has failed to engage consumers. Forecasts for their results suggest a 1.5 per cent drop in sales of homeware and clothing for the three months to September 30. This is despite a big push to appeal to different generations with their latest model signings who included Ellie Goulding and Helen Mirren. But the Christmas campaign seems set on targetting the younger market by engaging them online. As well as releasing the advert over the internet before it airs on TV, they are giving their Facebook fans and Twitter followers the opportunity to vote on a name for Rosie's dog in the advert.","Festive advert won't be shown on TV screens till Thursday .

"A five-year-old girl who was born with legs ‘like a frog’ has taken her first steps thanks to special splints. Emma-Grace Andrews suffers from a rare condition that caused her to be born with almost no muscle in her legs and arms. Her parents were told she would die during birth after scans showed that her limbs were dangerously twisted. Scroll down for video . Emma-Grace Andrews, five, was born with a rare congenital condition which caused her leg and arm joints to be curved. Her parents (Rachel and Alan, pictured) were told that she would spend her entire life in a  wheelchair but thanks to special splints she has taken her first steps . Despite being encouraged to have a termination, they refused to give up hope on their daughter. They were told that if she survived she would probably need to use a wheelchair her whole life. However, Emma-Grace has now taken her first steps using leg-straightening splints after an operation to stretch her muscles. Her mother, Rachel Andrews, 42, said: ‘When she was born, her legs were curled up and her feet back-to-front. She looked like a little frog. ‘Her arms were bent and her hands were twisted outwards. She was really deformed. I feel terrible saying it, but it was incredibly disturbing. Emma-Grace's condition was picked up at her mother's 20-week pregnancy scan. Doctors advised Rachel, and husband, Alan, to have her aborted because they feared she would not survive birth . ‘But I remember saying: ""My daughter is going to walk, run and dance. She’s going to do everything other children do”. ‘I was not going to accept what they were saying but it hasn’t been easy. I was close to giving up. ‘If you’d told me a year ago my daughter would walk unaided I would think you were utterly mad. ‘She has overcome so many hurdles in such a short space of time. It’s absolutely incredible.’ Emma-Grace’s condition was picked up at her mother’s 20-week scan, leaving Mrs Andrews and husband Alan, 50, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, devastated. The full-time mother said: ‘We were utterly blown apart. I had two images in my head - a little white coffin and a child in a wheelchair. She spent much of her first few years of life with her legs in plaster but this failed to enable her to walk so she was referred to Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital for further treatment . Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a collective term for a large number of different syndromes characterised by non-progressive, joint curvatures that are present at birth.When the condition is present, the muscles in the baby's limbs tend to be partially or completely replaced by fat and fibrous tissue.The condition is present in about one in every 3,000 babies and is usually detected before birth.Treatment options include physiotherapy, splinting and surgery. ‘I was determined to carry on with my pregnancy though. ‘Alan and I coped with it very differently. He found it very hard to talk about it. ‘I . went out and bought baby clothes of all different ages because I just . refused to accept what they were telling me. It was my little act of . defiance.’ Emma-Grace . was born a week early by caesarean section and doctors diagnosed her . with multiple arthrogryposis, a congenital condition that causes curved . joints. The condition affects about 260 babies in the UK every year. After four days in hospital, Emma-Grace was discharged and allowed home. Mrs Andrews said: ‘What’s meant to be an amazing time, was pretty horrific. ‘People were coming round saying congratulations but we found it difficult to respond positively. We were both devastated. ‘I went into “mum” mode. I fed her, washed and dressed her but really I was just going through the motions. I was numb inside.’ At five-weeks-old, doctors put Emma-Grace’s legs in plaster in an attempt to straighten them. Emma-Grace spent six week with her legs in full-length plaster casts before she was fitted with splints. She also had surgery to stretch her leg muscles . But after three years, they realised it was having no effect and she was transferred to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital, where she underwent surgery. She was put in plaster from her hip right down to her feet for six weeks before doctors fitted full length splints. They were designed to keep her legs straight but she still couldn’t walk. Mrs Andrews said: ‘Our physiotherapist gave us a special ride-on horse to help her get around. ‘She loved it and called it Sausage. It gave her that little bit of independence for the first time in her life. We’d always had to carry her before. Emma-Grace became so distressed every time her parents put the splints on that they nearly gave up. However, when they tried them for the last time she took her first steps using a push-along dog for support . Emma-Grace is now waiting to see a specialist about her arms but is looking forward to being able to take part in her first school sports day . Emma-Grace is now able to take part in a stage school play at the family's local theatre . ‘Every morning, I’d try to put her splints on and she’d scream her head off. She’d beg me not to put them on. ‘She didn’t cry, she sobbed. It was heart-wrenching. ‘Alan couldn’t do it because he found it too upsetting. ‘I remember thinking whether I didn’t know if I could do it anymore. I was questioning if I was doing the right thing. ‘I decided to give it one more try . and if she didn’t walk, I’d leave it. My daughter would be in a . wheelchair like the doctors said.’ To her mother’s amazement, Emma-Grace took her first steps with a push-along dog the next day. And now, she’s progressed to walking unaided. Mrs Andrews said: ‘She was very wobbly but she did it. I showed her teachers the video and they cried. ‘She walked to school every day last week. We had to leave early but I don’t care. ‘It’s absolutely incredible what she’s achieved. She loves showing people that she can do it now. Sometimes she even runs. ‘She’s taking part in her first . sports day this week and is in a stage school play at our local theatre. All the things I hoped for are becoming a reality.’ The couple, who also have a son, . Jordan, seven, and two-year-old daughter, Rosie, are now waiting to see a . specialist about how to flex Emma-Grace’s arms. Emma-Grace's parents (also pictured with son Jordan, seven, and daughter Rosie, two) say that their daughter has taught them to overcome challenges . Mrs Andrews said: ‘She is the most beautiful child you will ever know. She just radiates love. ‘It has been difficult but she has taught me and our family how to overcome and push through challenges.’ Mr Andrews, chief executive of a drug and alcohol intervention service, said: ‘When Emma-Grace was born I really struggled as I just did not know how to cope. ‘Over time, as I have got to know Emma and see her funny determined character, I have grown to adore her and I am amazed at her strength of character and the determination to persevere through every difficult situation that she goes through. ‘She is my little princess.’","Emma-Grace Andrews has arthrogryposis which causes joint curvature .

"The kitchen of the future could see all our fancy devices – even refrigerators and ovens - replaced by a 3D printer which will create meals from cartridges full of carbohydrates, protein powders and oils. The concept might sound rather far-fetched today, but NASA has just given 3D printer firm Systems & Materials Research Corporation (SMRC) a six month, $125,000 grant to focus on developing a universal food synthesizer. The device is similar to the ‘replicator’ used in several of the Star Trek TV series which enabled crew members to create their favorite foods. Food of the future? Experts are predicting the food in the future could be created using 3D printing technology . NASA is investing in the project because it wants to make it easier to transport nutrients in bulk through space, but SMRC’s founder Anjan Contractor believes the device will ultimately help solve the earth’s looming food crisis. With the earth’s population one day predicted to reach 12 billion people, the strain on our food sources will become immense. ‘I think, and many economists think, that current food systems can’t supply 12 billion people sufficiently,' Contractor told Quartz. 'So we eventually have to change our perception of what we see as food.' In Star Trek crew members used the 'replicator' to create their favorite foods and now experts are developing similar devices . The pizza of the future could contain insects instead of cheese and pepperoni . While only the very rich will be able to afford to eat real meat, fish and vegetables, Contractor predicts everyone else will eat customized, nutritionally-appropriate meals synthesized one layer at a time, from cartridges of powder and oil they buy at the corner grocery store. With traditional food sources extremely rare, those powders could be anything containing the right organic molecules including insects. Dutch technology company TNO Research has suggested that 3D printing could make it possible to turn food-like starting material, such as algae, insects and grass, into edible meals. Pizza is an obvious candidate for 3D printing because it has distinct layers and only requires the print head to create one substance at a time. SMRC is working on a prototype 3D food printer which founder Anjan Contractor believes will ultimately help solve the earth's looming food crisis . Dutch technology company TNO Research has suggested that 3D printing could make it possible to turn food-like starting material, such as algae, insects and grass, into edible meals . Contractor plans to start building his 'pizza printer' within the next couple of weeks, he has already printed a chocolate bar using the technology. It will work by first 'printing' a layer of dough, which is baked at the same time it’s printed, by a heated plate at the bottom of the printer. Then it will lay down a tomato base, 'which is also stored in a powdered form, and then mixed with water and oil,' says Contractor. Finally, the pizza will be topped with a 'protein layer,' which could come from any source - which eventually might mean insects or algae.

"A jobless single mother who flaunted her notoriety as a serial shoplifter with the boast, ‘At least I’m famous’, has finally been locked up. Jade Underwood was banned from 80 stores and had her photograph displayed on police posters after stealing relentlessly and terrorising her community. Just two weeks after being made the subject of a Crasbo – a criminal anti-social behaviour order – the 23-year-old returned to her old habits. 'At least I am famous': Single mother Jade Underwood appeared to enjoy the comparison made between her and character Vicky Pollard, right, who was played by Matt Lucas in the comedy Little Britain . Magistrates were told that she was caught stealing £110 of perfume from Debenhams in Stockport. She also stole food and DVDs from another shop and ignored a community punishment order by failing to turn up for an appointment. Underwood, who has been likened to Vicky Pollard, the foul-mouthed, tracksuit- bottomed character in Little Britain, has now been jailed for ten weeks for five offences of theft. At Stockport magistrates court she was also barred from a  further 120 shops across the town centre. Yesterday one shopkeeper said they were relieved Underwood had finally been sent to prison. ‘That woman has been nothing but a menace,’ the shopowner said. ‘Prison’s probably too good for the likes of her, but at least it will keep her from us – for now.’ Neighbours said the 5ft tall mother of three treated shoplifting as a vocation, bragging about her daily sprees. Shame: Bright yellow posters showing Jade's face were posted all around the area encouraging locals to report her if she flouted her CRASBO . One Boots store, in Edgeley, Stockport, had been targeted so many times that staff even stopped putting make-up on display. She also verbally abused parents taking their children to and from a local primary school and tormented neighbours in the tower block she lived in before being evicted for playing loud music until 5am. In May, after a catalogue of complaints about Underwood, police obtained the Crasbo, which differs from an Asbo in that it is imposed after a criminal conviction. In court she was described as a ‘prolific shoplifter’ who ‘on numerous occasions used language and behaviour that has caused considerable alarm, harassment and distress to shop staff’. Shameless: Mother-of-three Jade 'treated shoplifting like a job', would openly tell neighbours she was off to steal and refused to work because she was better off on benefits . The Crasbo barred Underwood from the main shopping street in Edgeley, a primary school and supermarkets. Posters bearing her grim-faced photo were put up to encourage residents to report her if she flouted the bans. But Underwood was undeterred and instead toasted her Crasbo on Facebook, posting a series of misspelt, crude messages from her new flat in Withington, Manchester. One said: ‘Heyy yah dont bring me down, let meh tell u f***ing hell least am famouse sad stupid t**ts !! Yah all whata leve meh da f*** alone coz m8 u whata start playing games like dat ..!’ Despite the threat of prison, the posters made Jade feel like a celebrity and she was caught shoplifting again just two weeks later in Debenhams . Former neighbour John Duggan, 55, said: ‘This woman has absolutely no shame whatsoever. She would openly say to me, “I’m going shoplifting today.” ‘She was not ashamed about telling me. ‘A leopard can never change their spots. She will never stop what she is doing. ‘She used to wear tracksuits and looked just like Vicky Pollard from the TV show. She’s a little terror.’ Yesterday Pc Jon Daniels, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘When she stole something, she would sometimes become  abusive and shout in the middle of the store. ‘The jail sentence shows if you breach your order, what can happen.’ He added: ‘Shoplifting has a massive knock-on effect for stores and can really add up. ‘Shops can lose thousands in a month and can close down through stock loss.’ CJ's in Stockport was just one of the original 80 shops which Jade was banned from as a result of her persistent shoplifting .","Jade Underwood, 23, abused neighbours, shop staff and mothers taking children to school .

"A herd of deer couldn't help but fawn over a newly-married couple as they took their wedding photos this past weekend. Photographer Ian Christmann was working the backyard wedding of Lauren and Erick in Stockton, NJ this weekend when the herd of deer appeared in the woods during the middle of dinner. So Christmann interrupted the bride and groom to see if they were interested in taking a photo with the gathering deer, and the newlyweds agreed. Stag party: Photographer Ian Christmann took these stunning pictures of couple Lauren and Erick on their wedding day this past weekend, when a herd of deer appeared in the woods near their ceremony . Kodak moment: Christmann says the deer were jittery, but the couple was still able to get close for a few amazing shots . 'The deer were quite jittery as we approached, so I didn’t expect that we would be able to get so close!' Christmann wrote on his website. The photographer posted the pictures to his Facebook Sunday evening, and says the images quickly went viral. By Monday morning the set of images had been posted to Reddit, and landed the top link for three hours, being viewed more than 3million times in just a day. 'A couple of people have asked if it was photoshopped and the answer is “nope.”' Christmann said. 'It’s a straight out of the camera capture apart from some dodging and burning and coloring in post.'

"The early bird really does catch the worm… but he saves it for dinner. Blue tits, great tits and other small garden birds scout for food in the morning but only return to eat it in the late afternoon, a study found. The Oxford University researchers believe the strategy allows them to stock up on food while avoiding the clutches of predators. A full belly in the morning would slow them down in the hunt for food and make them easy prey. Early riser: A foraging Great Tit with a worm in its beak . So they search out food when lean and lithe and then dine in the evening to ensure they have a big enough store of fat to survive through the night. The ‘early bird’ strategy was revealed in an experiment in which over 2,000 birds were fitted with tiny radio tags which activated when they landed on feeders hidden in Wytham Woods, near Oxford. The feeders were moved around over the course of the day and the researchers noted when the birds landed on them. This revealed that the birds were much better at finding the feeders’ new locations in the morning.  However, they waited until the afternoon to get tucked in. The researchers said the complex strategy acts as an insurance policy, with birds remaining light yet still able to get enough fat to survive the night. It is particularly important in winter when the risks of predation are high and just one day without food can make the difference between life and death for small birds. The Oxford University researchers believe the strategy allows the birds to stock up on food while avoiding the clutches of predators . Zoologist Damien Farine said: ‘Birds have to store body fat to avoid starving during the cold winter nights, but this can make them slower and less manoeuvrable so they are more likely to be caught by predators. ‘So there is a trade-off, where birds need to remain lean enough in order to “outrun” their predators, or at least the next slowest bird, during the day but also store enough fat to survive each night.’ Writing in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, he added that the study shows that rather than ‘idly waiting’ to until the afternoon, the birds start searching out food in the morning. ‘Our results show these birds display very different patterns of food discovery in the morning and afternoon; very few new food sources were found during the afternoon, whereas nearly every new food source we put out during the morning was quickly discovered. ‘It supports the idea of an ‘early bird’ strategy of scouting for food early on so they can return to feast a couple of hours before dusk in preparation for a long winter’s night.’","Study monitored behaviour of blue tits, great tits and other small .

"Muslim schools all over Britain are forcing female pupils as young as 11 to wear burkas, it emerged today. Institutions say that they are 'strict' on uniforms for their children because full-face veils are the 'desired dress code of a Muslim female'. But campaigners believe it is 'wrong' for any child to cover their face and the Home Secretary Theresa May says that all women should be able to 'make a choice' about what they wear. Some Islamic schools in Britain force female pupils as young as 11 to wear full-face veils as part of their uniform . It came as a judge ruled this week that a Muslim will be allowed to stand trial with her face covered as long as it is removed while giving evidence. The case has prompted some MPs to call for full-face veils to be banned but many Islamic schools, which have control over uniform policy, insist their pupils wear burkas. The Madani Girls School in Tower Hamlets, East London, requires all its pupils wear a black burka and a long black coat outside. On its website, its describes its uniform policy as 'strict' and as supporting the 'desired dress code of a Muslim female'. It continues: 'The present uniform conforms to the Islamic Code of dressing and must be adhered to at all times both within the school and dismissal at the end of the day.' The school does not allow any of its 300 pupils to wear any form of makeup or jewellery. The Ayesha Siddiqa Girls School in . Southall, West London, also insists pupils wear a navy blue burka or a . jilbab, which does not cover the face. On its website, the school says its is 'not willing to compromise on any issues regarding uniform'. Madani Girls School, in Tower Hamlets, East London, insists all pupils wear a black burka and a long black coat . Many other Muslim schools - including around a dozen state-funded schools - require female pupils to cover their hair. It comes after Judge Peter Murphy, sitting at London's Blackfriars Crown Court, ruled it was 'crucial' for jurors to be able to see a defendant's face when giving evidence. The 22-year-old in question, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said it is against her religious beliefs to show her face in public. Referred to in court as 'D', she . entered a not guilty plea to a charge of intimidation last week while . wearing a niqab after the judge backed down from a previous decision . that she would have to show her face to be properly identified. Meanwhile . the topic of wearing veils in school has dominated headlines in recent . weeks after Birmingham Metropolitan College was made to retract a policy . which forced pupils to remove veils while on the premises so they can . be identified. Home . Office Minister Jeremy Browne has called for a national debate on . whether the state should step in to prevent young women having the veil . imposed upon them. But . Home Secretary Theresa May has said it is for women to 'make a choice' about what clothes they wear, including veils, although there will be . some circumstances when it will be necessary to ask for them to be . removed. A student at Birmingham Metropolitan College wears a full veil after the college reversed its position which previously banned students from wearing niqabs so they could be 'easily identifiable at all times' 'I start from the position that I don't think Government should tell people, I don't think the Government should tell women, what they should be wearing,' Mrs May said. 'I think it's for women to make a choice about what clothes they wish to wear, if they wish to wear a veil that is for a woman to make a choice. 'There will be some circumstances in which it's right for public bodies, for example at the border, at airport security, to say there is a practical necessity for asking somebody to remove a veil. 'I think it's for public bodies like the Border Force officials, it's for schools and colleges, and others like the judiciary, as we've recently seen, to make a judgment in relation to those cases as to whether it's necessary to ask somebody to remove the veil'.","Many Islamic schools in Britain insist their pupils wear burkas or veils .

"Change: Nearly three in 10 primary school pupils are from ethnic minority, new data shows. (File picture) More than a million school children now do not speak English as their mother tongue - up by nearly 54,000, new official figures reveal. A survey of the nation's classrooms, which provides an accurate snapshot of the composition of schools in England, shows a radical transformations taking place. During the past five years alone, the number of pupils without English as a native language has increased by almost 250,000. The figures also show an increase in the number of pupils in England who are classed as being from an ethnic minority background. Now nearly three in 10 primary school children in this category. In the last year, the numbers of . children who speak English as an additional language have risen by . almost 54,000, according to statistics published by the Department for . Education (DfE). More than 18 per cent of the 4.3million primary school pupils had a first language that was not English - an increase from 17.5 per cent in 2012. In secondary schools the proportion falls slightly, with nearly 14 per cent of the 3.2 million pupils surveyed revealing that their first language was not English - an increase from 12.9 per cent in 2012. That equates to almost one in five primary pupils, aged between five and 11, and around one in seven of those in secondaries, who are between 11 and 16 years of age,  who speak another language at home. Overall, . the figures show that 1,061,010 million children in England’s state . primary, secondary and special schools, as well as pupil referral units . (PRUs) had a first language that is known or believed to be other than . English. This is up from 1,007,090 youngsters in 2012 - an extra 53,920 pupils. In . 2008, around 832,790 children spoke English as a second language, . although this figure does not include those being taught in PRUs. It means that the numbers have risen by around 227,000 in the last five years.

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Many schools teach pupils whose first language is not English successfully. 'Through the school funding formula, . councils can provide more support for pupils whose first language is not . English for up to three years from when they first enter education.' A recent evidence review by NIESR for the Migration Advisory Committee examined statistical evidence on attainment of pupils with English as an additional language and found that these pupils perform almost as well as those whose first language is English. A breakdown of the data shows that 18.1per cent of primary school pupils speak a first language that is not English, along with 13.6per cent of those in secondary schools, 12.7per cent of those taught in special schools and 8.7per cent of those at PRUs. Almost a million primary school children - 965,110 in total (28.5per cent) are considered to be from a minority ethnic background, along with nearly a quarter (775,710, or 24.2per cent) of those taught in state secondaries, the figures show. Last year, 27.6per cent of primary-age children and 23.2per cent of those in secondary schools were classed as being of 'minority ethnic origin'. English-speaking children were in a minority in 1,600 schools, according to a 2012 census. The figures particularly startling in the 14 inner London boroughs, where there were 98,000 non-native English speakers compared to 78,000 who could list the language as their number one. Nationwide, there were 97 schools where the number of pupils speaking English as a mother tongue was fewer than one in 20 of the school population. After London, Birmingham had the highest concentration of 'foreign' pupils, followed by Bradford and then Leicester. Punjabi was the most widely-spoken first language. London has the highest concentration of schools with a majority of pupils who do not have English as their first language at home. Across the 14 boroughs that make up Inner London, there are 98,000 schoolchildren whose first language is not English, compared to just 79,000 native English speakers. Within the London boroughs, Newham had the highest amount with 79 schools, followed by Tower Hamlets with 70, Brent with 57 and Ealing with 55 schools. London was followed by Birmingham with 117 schools where the majority of pupils do not have English as their mother tongue. Bradford came next with 59 schools followed by Leicester with 40 schools.Manchester has 35 schools, while Lancashire has 30 schools and Kirklees has 27. Luton has 22 schools and Slough 19. The local authority areas with the smallest proportion of pupils who have English as a second language are Halton with 0.9 per cent and Redcar and Cleveland also with 0.9 per cent. They were closely followed by Derbyshire with 1.3 per cent, Rutland 1.5 with per cent, St Helens with 1.5 per cent, and Cornwall with 1.6 per cent.","Number has risen by 250,000 in the past five years .

"We've all been guilty of over-packing for a holiday abroad. Even if you're only jetting off on a quick weekend jaunt, it's easy to start dreaming up every possible weather contingency or holiday activity scenario that could have you needing those knee-high wellies, your full gym kit, or one of your many hair-styling gadgets. But does anyone ever actually use these 'must have' items? Almost never. Scroll down for video . Don't let this happen to you! Ensure that you never over-pack again with these top expert tips . To help you solve any of your potential packing problems, we've gone right to the source, polling several top travel writers, fashion bloggers and beauty gurus on their must-have - and must-leave-behind - holiday items. Blowdryers, flat irons, curling irons . This one often winds up being completely redundant. 'Almost all hotels and many hostels have them,' says Julie Falconer, writer and owner of travel blog, A Lady in London. 'Hairdryers just take up a lot of space in luggage.' 'Plus, if you're travelling abroad, you'll often find that your hairdryer doesn't even work due to different electric voltage in other countries.' Leave your blowdryers at home... most hotels and hostels have them these days anyway . More than one jacket or coat . This is a packing faux pas with one heavy price to pay - it will weigh your bag down and may even require you to opt for a checked case over carry-on luggage. 'Too many coats and jackets can be a pain because they take up space and weight,'  British fashion blogger, Susie Bubble, admits. 'On cold breaks away, I've now learnt to just wear one on-board and stick to it.' You won't wear those flimsy summer dresses - and if you do, you'll wind up freezing, like this woman (left) Seasonally inappropriate dresses . 'I always pack lots of slip dresses,' Susie continues. 'I don't even know where one buys slip dresses anymore but I have a stash of vintage ones that in my head are 'handy' for holidays. I'll layer them, I think. That never happens.' Noted: leave all rarely worn flimsy frocks at home. Trainers  take up a lot of space in your carry-on, and, be honest: will you really hit the hotel gym? A full gym kit . It's been a busy week leading up to your holiday in the sun and you haven't had time to exercise. No problem, you think, I'll work out in the hotel gym once I arrive. This is rarely the case. Instead, you wind up taking up precious space with trainers, spandex leggings and a sports bra that you won't look at again during your getaway. If you pack your best lingerie, you're more likely to meet the man of your dreams, right? Er, maybe not... Lingerie . If you plan for it, that must mean that you'll meet the man of your dreams on holiday, doesn't it? Of course there's always a chance, but that stiff corset you shoved into your bag probably isn't even all that necessary when it comes to wooing said hypothetical guy. Way too many tampons . Even if it's not that dreaded time of the month - doesn't matter - a lady must always be prepared. Nevermind the fact that almost any destination you're heading off to will likely sell the products in question, we all know those women who insist on bringing the entire variety pack. Even if it's not that time of the month, many women still feel the need to pack several variety packs . Several handbag options . You need one for touring during the day, a smaller option for a night out, and a carry-all for the plane, right? Before you know it, half of your suitcase is comprised of handbags. We went to the experts to find the perfect all-round option. 'I take a rucksack or a roomy crossover bag with secure closures,' Susie says. 'I don't do clutches on holiday - too easy to lose or get stolen and not enough room to carry all the essentials.' Think you'll read that book you've been meaning to for months? Probably not on the plane... That book you’ve been meaning to read . Chances are, if the book has been collecting dust on your bookshelf for several weeks, your upcoming plane ride is almost certainly not the time you'll finally crack it open. Excessive amounts of beauty products . An array of moisturisers and cleansers? Leave them. Nail varnish remover? Nope, you won't use it. When it comes to bringing beauty products abroad, stick to the basics and try to opt for an all-in-one compact. Makeup artist and Pixiwoo video blogger, Samantha Chapman, says: 'I tend to take products that have multiple purposes, like BB creams that have coverage and SPF or lip and cheek duos.' 'Micellar water is also great as it removes makeup from eyes, lips and cheeks,' adds Susannah Taylor, editor of beauty website, Get The Gloss. Instead of taking your entire beauty bag, opt for products that pull double duty or an all-in-one compact . Expensive jewellery . Why risk it? Those shoes you never wear (be it sky-high stilettos or rubber wellie boots) 'One pair of shoes for walking around during the day and another for any dressier occasions in the evening is usually sufficient,' Julie says. 'Leave the 'just in case' shoes at home. They can take up a lot of packing space, often unnecessarily.' Those sky-high stilettos you never wear? The best time to try them out is definitely not during a holiday . Stay aware from alluring airport bargains! The only travel accessory you really need is an adaptor . Loads of travel gadgets and accessories . All you really need is an adaptor (depending on where you're headed) and your smart phone to keep you connected. And when it comes to those bargain travel accessories, skip the airport shops and their allure - including those inflatable pillows, hand-held fans and under-clothes money belts.‘I have a leopard eye mask that I always think I will use, but in reality, am far too embarrassed to take out of my bag,’ says Todd Plummer, a New York City-based fashion writer. Full-size shampoo and conditioner . This can be a tempting one. After all, you never know how the cold air, or alternatively, the heat and humidity, will mess with your hair. Still, most hotels do leave mini versions out for guests and, really, is packing the gargantuan bottles really worth being forced to check your bag?","Most women fall victim to over-packing when heading off on holiday .

"Campaign: Sir Roger Moore last week called for a boycott of Fortnum & Mason until it stops selling foie gras. Plans to build a foie gras factory farm in China have now been withdrawn . Plans to build a massive foie gras factory farm in China have been withdrawn after a campaign backed by James Bond actor Roger Moore, it was claimed today. British company Creek Projects Investments was to have funded the £10million project to build one of the world’s biggest facilities producing the liver pate, made by force-feeding ducks and geese. Animal welfare campaigners said they had received confirmation from China that the construction will not go ahead. The decision is said to have been taken after months of appeals and petitions in Britain and China. In April, Creek Projects posted a note on its website saying the foie gras operation had been suspended as a result of 'concerns from the public'. The company’s directors called for a review 'to include input from animal welfare and environmental experts to address any issues which may or may not exist'. A spokesperson for Humane Society International (HSI), one of the animal welfare charities involved, said the project was 'definitely not going ahead'. The facility in China’s Jiangxi Province would have slaughtered eight million ducks and two million geese a year to produce 1,000 tonnes of foie gras. The news comes a week after Sir Roger, 84, . who played James Bond in seven movies, accused upmarket department store Fortnum & Mason of . selling 'torture in a tin' at its London store. He also claimed the retailer was trying to 'hoodwink' shoppers into believing that foie gras is ethically sourced. Sir Roger's comments followed an . investigation by animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of . Animals (PETA), which he said found that some birds were unable to . stand because they were so 'desperately ill'. The actor said in a petition letter: 'For years, Fortnum & . Mason – one of the few remaining shops that still sell the vile product . foie gras – have been attempting to hoodwink the public into believing . that the foie gras it sells in its food hall and restaurants is . ""ethical"". 'Now, thanks only to PETA, we know that company’s claims are a sham.' Controversial: Concerns have been raised about foie gras because its production involves force-feeding grain and fat to geese or ducks . A geese farm in France. The foie gras facility in China's Jiangxi Province would have slaughtered eight million ducks and two million geese a year (file picture) The actor said that PETA's film . showed terrible conditions at farms which supply the company that . provides foie gras to Fortnum & Mason. The . retailer said it would investigate PETA's allegations, but said some of . the footage was not taken at farms it used as suppliers. A . spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: 'We have instructed the appropriate . individuals within the business to look into the allegations.' Making . the delicacy typically involves force-feeding birds by placing a tube . down their throats and pumping large amounts of food directly into their . stomachs. This causes the liver to become enlarged by up to ten times . its normal size. Foie gras force-feeding is banned in Britain, but the product is still available from fine food specialists and in restaurants. The campaign against the factory farm was backed by HSI, Compassion in World Farming, and the RSPCA, among others. It received strong celebrity support, including from Sir Roger. HSI said its representatives in China had learned that the Creek Projects facility had been abandoned. Confirmation came in a radio broadcast on China’s Central People’s Broadcasting Station, quoting a local government official. Investigation: Fortnum & Mason last week said it maintained 'rigorous quality control procedures' Mark . Jones, the charity’s director, said: 'The abandoning of plans to . construct this massive foie gras production facility in China is a great . example of animal protection groups across the world using their . collective reach to challenge animal cruelty. 'The . forced feeding of birds for foie gras production is illegal in our own . country, and the British public will not tolerate investments in such . cruel practices by British companies overseas.' A . man answering the phone at a contact number listed on Creek Projects’ website, who said he was authorised to handle press inquiries, refused . to discuss the fate of the foie gras facility. He said: 'Any . announcements will be made to the market.' In . June, campaigners sent a petition letter to local officials in Jianxi . Province in China, co-signed by a number of organisations and including a . message from Sir Roger. Appeals were also sent to the Chinese embassy in London, and the headquarters of Creek Projects Investments in Huntingdon. Joyce . D’Silva, ambassador for Compassion in World Farming, said: 'This is a . triumph for animal welfare and campaigners across the globe. Just as . cruelty knows no geographical boundaries, neither does compassion and . concern for the welfare of animals.' More . than a dozen countries have banned foie gras production including . Britain, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, . Norway, Poland, Turkey and Israel. The practice is also outlawed in . California and most Austrian provinces.","British firm was to have funded £10million project to build massive facility producing the liver pate, made by force-feeding ducks and geese ."
"It is a small Alaskan village whose inhabitants have relied on the sea for countless generations. But within a decade, it is expected that the ocean which the village of Kivalina has so relied on will completely destroy it - creating America's first climate change refugees. Temperatures in the Arctic region of Alaska are warming twice as fast as the rest of the U.S, causing ice to retreat, sea levels to rise and coastal erosion to increase. Scroll down for video . Worrying: It is predicted that within a decade the Alaskan village of Kivalina will be completely underwater - creating America's first climate change refugees . Extreme:  Kivalina is located on a barrier island off the coast of northwest Alaska. Many of the Inupiat Eskimo villagers rely on wild animals to survive . At risk: A dramatic retreat of Arctic ice has left the village vulnerable to coastal erosion . Protection: The inhabitants of the village have always been protected from ferocious storms by a think layer of ice. Instead, they now rely on these sandbags . The 400 indigenous Inuit inhabitants of Kivalina, who live in single-storey cabins, have always been protected from the ferocious autumn and winter storms by a think layer of ice. But, as reported by the BBC, during the last two decades there has been a huge retreat of Arctic ice, leaving the village vulnerable to coastal erosion. The U.S government has attempted to help, but its solutions have never been long-term. A defensive wall was built along the beach in 2008. However, it could not prevent an emergency evacuation two years ago following an enormous storm. Video courtesy of The Episcopal Church . Angry: The inhabitants of Kivalina are furious, saying they are having to pick up a mess which was not created by them . Tough: Many of the 400 indigenous Inuit inhabitants of Kivalina live in single-storey cabins . Icy: This aerial image of Kivalina taken in 2008 shows the partly ice covered sea to the left . Reduction: However, this image taken this year shows how much the ice surrounding Kivalina has melted . Remote: This map shows the isolated location of Kivalina within the Alaskan wilderness . Now, engineers predict the 7.5 mile-long barrier island will be uninhabitable by 2025, completely submerged by the surrounding Chukchi Sea. The U.S government estimates that it would cost up to $400, (£265m) to relocate the residents to higher ground. But, with there being no sign that the money will come from public funds, the indigenous residents of the village are furious. Speaking to the BBC, Kivalina council leader, Colleen Swanm, said: 'If we're still here in 10 years time we either wait for the flood and die, or just walk away and go someplace else. 'The US government imposed this Western lifestyle on us, gave us their burdens and now they expect us to pick everything up and move it ourselves. What kind of government does that?' A census taken in 2000 shows there were 377 people on Kivalina in 78 households with a total of 64 families residing in the village. It revealed the racial makeup of the village was 3.45 per cent white with 96.55 per cent Native American. Perhaps most worryingly for its future, of the 78 households,  61.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them. When President Obama promised to take measures to combat climate change it provoked strong opposition. But those campaigning to highlight the issues of global warming will show the cynics how, through Kivalina, it is happening in their own country. Concerns: Built on this long, narrow stretch of land, Kivalina is now extremely vulnerable to the sea . Desperate: Residents are now using every means possible to save their homes . Traditional: This image from Kivalina, taken around 1900, shows members of the Eskimo town council . Wrapped up: Pupils from the village's school are pictured around 1900 . Kivalina was first known as Kivualinagmut after its discovery in 1847 by the Russian Navy. Since then, it has long been a stopping place for travelers heading to Arctic coastal areas. The most recent census shows there were . 377 people on Kivalina living in 78 households. Perhaps most worryingly for its future, of the 78 households, 61.5 per cent had children under the age of 18 living with them. It is the only village in the region where people hunt the bowhead whale. Originally, it was located at the north end of the Kivalina Lagoon but later relocated. In 1960, an airstrip was built on the island. A new school and an electric system were constructed during the 1970s. The problems in Kivalina are also experienced in the most northerly tip of US territory in the town of Barrow. The residents of the town have been fraught with problems this year thanks to climate change. In . March, the sea ice began to melt and break up. After eventually . refreezing, it was so unstable that the townsfolk were unable to hunt . for whales and seals, completely wrecking their hunting season. Experienced . whale hunters say for the first time in decades, they caught not a . single bowhead whale. Residents now face a long, bleak winter. Climate change is a divisive issue in the U.S among politicians. New Jersey Democratic Rush Holt released a 90-second YouTube campaign ad last Monday  in which he calls for a carbon tax. Without it, he warns, 'millions will die.' On his campaign website the eight-term congressman, one of two physicists in the House of Representatives, blames global warming on 'the assault that corporate interests are waging on our planet.' 'We can no longer allow Republicans to deny obvious truths,' Holt says in the longer version of his campaign video.

"The First Lady's whirlwind tour of Spain in 2010 better have been a once in a lifetime trip, because her getaway cost taxpayers nearly half a million dollars. The highly controversial and lavish trip drew ire at the time, but the White House assured the public that the Obamas picked up the tab on their own. But new information from Judicial Watch, a public interest group that investigates government corruption, detailed the extensive security costs to the United States Air Force and Secret Service. The Obamas' highly publicized and polarizing vacations may cost the First Family even more, as voters appear to be disheartened by their extravagance. Scroll down for video . Inquisition: New documents revealed that Michelle Obama's trip to Spain in 2010 cost taxpayers $500,000 . 'The American people can ill afford to keep sending the First Family on vacations around the globe,' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said. 'There needs to be greater sensitivity to the costs borne by taxpayers for these personal trips.' In 2010, Mrs Obama visited the Spain's picturesque coastal towns, shopped, toured and even had a lunch date with the country’s King and Queen. Her every move was highly documented and scrutinized by the press, which called her trip 'tone-deaf' during tough economic times. 'It is hypocritical for President Obama to fire GSA officials for wasteful conference spending, while his family went on a luxury vacation in the Costa del Sol Spain that cost taxpayers nearly half a million dollars,' Fitton said. The New York Times previously reported that Mrs. Obama brought along her daughter Sasha, 'two friends and four of their daughters, as well as a couple of aides and a couple of advance staff members.' Shopper's Paradise: The five-day trip included loads of shopping and sight-seeing. In this photo, Michelle Obama, left, visits the Alhambra and the Palace of Charles the 5th . The five day trip cost at least $467,585, according to Judicial Watch. The total cost of flying Michelle Obama from Camp Andrews to Malaga and then to Mallorca and back to the United States was $199,323.75. That tab is based on just 17 hours and 15 minutes of total flying time. The White House said that the First Lady would reimburse only the equivalent of first-class commercial tickets for herself and her daughter Sasha, since the rest of the seats were occupied by Secret Service. Her friends flew on separate commercial flights, the New York Times reported. Royal Excursion: While on the trip, the First Lady met with the King and Queen of Spain for a lunch date .

In addition, their food cost was $876.30, which included an American indulgence of $57.68 for four bottles of maple syrup and a package of pancake mix. Secret Service records, meanwhile, show that the costs to the agency for the vacation were $254,461.20. This total includes $26,670.61 for a chauffeur tour of Costa del Sol and $50,078.78 for a travel planning company SET P&V, S.L. Though her trips may cost taxpayers money, they could also cost President Obama his job. High Price: New polls conducted by Republican researchers reveal that the First Family's extravagant lifestyle makes undecided voters sour . Top-tier Republican pollsters, organized by Resurgent Republic, traveled to 11 battleground states to host focus groups. The spoke to independent and swing voters who were Obama supporters in 2008, but are now undecided. 'They don’t like Obama using their tax dollars to benefit himself,' pollster John McLaughlin said to the Washington Examiner. The lesson from the sessions, McLaughlin said, is that the first family 'is out of touch' with working class voters. And they well may be - the First Lady revealed today that one of her secret 'fantasies' is to sneak away from the Secret Service's watchful eye, a move that would no doubt cost taxpayers a pretty penny. 'It is hard to sneak around and do what you want,' Michelle Obama said today at a 'Take your child to work day' event. 'I have done it a couple of times. But you know one fantasy I have, and the Secret Service they keep looking at me because they think I might actually do it, is to walk right out the front door and just keep walking.' She also revealed her political future, or lack of one, depending on how you read her response. When asked if she would ever go after her husband's job, the First Lady responded with a resounding 'Maybe.' 'Being president is a really hard job and it’s an important job,' Mrs Obama said. 'I think one of the things you learn about yourself as you get older are what are your strengths and what are your interests. And for me it’s other stuff that is not being the president. So I probably won’t run. But that’s a great question.' By Toby Harnden . Flight Plan: President Barack Obama disembarks from Marine One on the South Lawn. His use of official vehicles for fundraising trips has caused concern . President Barack Obama has already held more than twice as many re-election fundraising events than President George W. Bush did in his entire 2004 re-election campaign. According to Mark Knoller of CBS News, unofficial keeper of presidential statistics, Obama has held 124 fundraisers - about one every three days - since he launched his re-election bid last April compared to the 57 Bush held to raise cash for his re-election bid eight years ago . Obama’s frenetic fundraising schedule had prompted the Republican National Committee (RNC) to lodge a formal complaint with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) about misuse of taxpayer money. The Obama campaign dismissed the complaint as a ‘stunt’ and the White House said that it would follow the same rules as previous administrations and refund the appropriate amounts. According to the Pentagon, the Boeing 747 that normally serves as Air Force One costs $179,750 an hour to operate. In the complaint, Reince Priebus, RNC chairman, wrote: ‘Throughout his administration, but particularly in recent weeks, President Obama has been passing off campaign travel as 'official events,' thereby allowing taxpayers, rather than his campaign, to pay for his re-election efforts.' John Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives, today demanded that Barack Obama ‘pony up and reimburse the Treasury’ for what he said were are campaign trips to battleground states dressed up as presidential travel. He accused the Obama campaign of manufacturing a phony fight about student loans and then using Air Force One to hold what amounted to re-election rallies in swing states. ‘Frankly, I think this is beneath the dignity of the White House … for the president to make a campaign issue about it and then travel to three battleground states,’ he said. 'This one does not pass the straight-face test. You know it, and I know it. It’s time for the Obama campaign to pony up and reimburse the Treasury.’ He added that ‘the president keeps trying to invent these kind of fake fights because he doesn’t have a record’ and ‘the emperor wears no clothes’. Priebus said that the Obama campaign ‘has been cheating the American taxpayer by using taxpayer dollars to fund their general election efforts’ and had ‘held more campaign events in three-and-a-half  years than any other president did in their full term’. 'It’s time for the Obama campaign to pony up and reimburse the Treasury.’ John Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives . He pointed to Obama's current trip to North Carolina, Colorado, and Iowa, all key battleground states, to discuss extending lower interest rates on student loans as examples of this tax-payer funded campaign travel. ‘One might imagine that if this were genuinely a government event he might have stopped in a non-battleground state like Texas or Vermont,' his complaint said. Priebus told reporters: ‘This President and Air Force One seem to have a magic magnet that only seem to land in battleground states in this country.’ He added that a trip to Florida a fortnight ago, when an official speech was added to a day’s programme of fundraising, was suspect. ‘This speech was high on class warfare, slogans, and divisive campaign style rhetoric. It was low on substance that would benefit the populace at large.’","New documents disclose $500,000 tab Michelle Obama left  for taxpayers .

"Google has filed a patent that could let users unlock their smartphones and tablets using facial expressions rather than typing in passwords. The latest Google Android devices already have a built-in Face Unlock feature that uses facial recognition to unlock their handsets, but this patent would take the technology a step further adding additional 'liveness' features. When Google launched Face Unlock in 2011, as part of Android Ice Cream Sandwich, it was criticised by security experts because it could be bypassed by holding static photos up to the phone or tablet's camera. If a patent filed by Google is approved, it could mean users would be able to unlock their smartphones by pulling faces such as frowning, smiling, poking out their tongue, wrinkling their nose, blinking and so on. The technology would compare the facial expression pulled with a previously captured photo and if the expressions matched, the user would be allowed access to their device . In the update to Android Jelly Bean  in July 2012, Google added a 'liveness' check in an attempt to prevent these static images being used to gain access to devices. This meant a user would have to blink while using Face Unlock to prove they were alive. However, even this could be bypassed using clever photo editing tricks. According to Google's latest U.S patent, the new system would require users to pull a specific, predeterminded facial expression. To get access to a device the user would have to pull a specific predeterminded facial expression. The expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user's identity. Facial expressions listed include blinking, frowning, smiling, sticking out a tongue, wrinkling a nose and raising an eyebrow. The patent explains there would be a . small margin of error but the user's expression would have to match the . original photo as closely as possible. The technology would then check for 'liveness' - a signal that shows the user is alive and moving and not a static image. It would scan for changes in pixels and light to monitor and recognise the changes in the location of the facial features. For example, if a blink is used to gain access the . technology would record the light from the eye and then monitor if this . light changes, suggesting the eye has been closed. This 'live' movement is then given a score based on how similar it is to the original image. If the score reaches the minimum security threshold, the phone is unlocked. If it doesn't the user is denied access and has to try again. The expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user's identity. The patent said: 'The anti-spoofing techniques herein may use . facial gestures such as blinks, . winks, and other gestures that may be performed within the confines of a . human face. '[The device] may detect facial gestures associated . with various facial features. Examples include one or both eyes (e.g., . for blinks, winks, etc.), the mouth area (e.g., for gestures including . smiling, frowning, displaying a user's teeth, extending a user's tongue, . etc.), the nose (e.g., for a nose wrinkle gesture, etc.), the forehead . (e.g., for a forehead wrinkle gesture, etc.), one or both eyebrows (for . eyebrow raise and compression gestures, etc.), and various others.' Google already lets its users enable two-step verification for their online accounts, and offers Face Unlock on Android. With Face Unlock, pictured, Android users can use their face to unlock their smartphone or tablet, in place of a PIN or a pattern . The patent explains there would be a small margin of error but the user's expression would have to match the original photo as closely as possible. A chart in the patent shows that the technology would capture the first facial image and compare it to the photo on file. It would then check for 'liveness'. According to the patent: 'In the example of the . blink gesture, corresponding pixel locations of the . first and second sub-images may represent portions of the corneas and . the eyelids, respectively. 'Additionally, the eyelids may include less . pixel transitions than the corneas. 'More specifically, a cornea may . display pixel transitions (e.g., contrasting colors) with respect to two . or more of the sclera, iris, and pupil. Images in the Google's patent, pictured, filed to the U.S Patent and Trademark Office, show that the technology scans the eyes and other features for changes in pixels and light fluctuations. These changes can be used to track movement. If the changes caused by the facial expression don't match the photo on file the user will be denied access to their device . 'Conversely, an eyelid may . display pixel transitions only at its upper bound (relative to the . eyebrow) and lower bound (relative to the eyelash).' This means the device would check for the location of light and pixels relative to a person's face and their facial features. If a blink is used to gain access, for example, the technology would record the light from the eye and then monitor if this light changes, suggesting the eye had been closed. Google added a 'liveness' check feature to Android Jelly Bean. This means users have to blink when using Face Unlock to prove they are not a photo in order to get access to their device . This 'live' movement is then given a score based on how similar it is to the original image. If the score reaches the minimum security threshold, the phone is unlocked. If it doesn't the user is denied access and has to try again. The patent doesn't explain how many times a user can try to access the device before it is permanently locked, not does it say if there is a failsafe technique if the user can't get in. The patent is still waiting for approval and Google declined to comment on the plans, including when its likely to be available if it gets approval. Motorola announced in May it was also looking at alternatives to the traditional passwords using physical authentication. Among the ideas discussed at the D11 . conference in California were electronic tattoos and . pills that people swallow. The . tattoos, developed by Massachusetts-based engineering firm MC10, . contain flexible electronic circuits that are attached to the wearer's . skin using a rubber stamp. Motorola . claimed that the circuits, which also contain antennae and built-in . sensors, could be adapted to work with mobile phones and tablets. This image shows the various parts that make up the MC10 electronic tattoo called the Biostamp. It can be stuck to the body using a rubber stamp, and protected using spray-on bandages. The circuit can be worn for two weeks and Motorola believes this makes it perfect for authentication purposes . The mobile devices could then be used to confirm the owner's identity and log them in to accounts automatically. Another idea presented during the keynote talk at the Wall Street Journal conference with head of Motorola Dennis Woodside and . senior vice president for advanced technology and products, Regina Dugan, was a swallowable pill.

"A record-holding American freediver died Sunday afternoon shortly after emerging from the water during a diving tournament in the Bahamas. Nicholas Mevoli, 32, of Brooklyn, New York, dove to a depth of more than 200 feet and returned to the surface - he soon had trouble breathing, passed out and was soon pronounced dead. The New York man's identity was first reported by the Long Island (Bahamas) Runner. A blog post written last by Mr Mevoli shows he had barely escaped death at least one other time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . He died doing what he loved: Nick Mevoli traveled all over the world to compete in diving tournaments . The incident happened around 2 p.m. Sunday off the coast of the Bahamas' Long Island, which is about 164 . miles (265 kilometers) southeast of the capital of Nassau. The novice competitive diver had reached a depth of 72 meters, about 236 feet, before attempting to surface, according to a press release from AIDA International. He was trying to break a record for the deepest 'Constant No Fins' free dive, according to an event organizer. Mr Mevoli was brought to shore, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to revive him as he was transported to a local hospital. The television industry veteran was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the hospital, the release added. The nine-day International Free Diving Competition Mr Mevoli took part in brings 56 free divers from 21 countries. The divers compete for a $20,000 prize won by the brave soul who can dive the deepest without fins or scuba gear. Thrillseeker: Mr Mevoli had only been diving competitively since last year, but had once before pushed himself to near-death during a tournament . Novice, but world-class: Mr Mevoli set a handful of records and placed in the top three of multiple tournaments this year, even winning one . The contest takes place at Dean's Blue Hole, which is considered the world's deepest underwater sinkhole in seawater, the rest of it was cancelled after Mr Mevoli's death. Mr Mevoli had only been diving competitively since last year, AIDA noted, but had been very successful during his short career. 'Nick was an extraordinary talent, breaking the US constant weight record shortly after beginning competitive freedive in 2012,' the release said. The talented waterman also placed first at a Deja Blue competition earlier this year in Curacao, as well as took second in competitions in Honduras and Greece, AIDA noted. He also held a handful of other free-diving records, according to a IFDC organizer. Paradise shattered: Mr Mevoli's final dive came off this Bahamas coastline . He leaves behind a devastated family: Mr Mevoli's sister posted this picture to Facebook and thanked people for their condolences . Friends and family shared their grief over Mr Mevoli's sudden death across social media. 'Shocked and deeply saddened by news of this loss. Nick was a fantastic person who loved life, loved diving, loved people. Rest in peace, Nick,' an acquaintance wrote on Facebook. 'R.I.P. NIC MEVOLI we love you,' tweeted @Vertical_Blue. 'Nick Mevoli, you will be missed friend, comrade, and amazing guy,' @GrantWGraves tweeted. 'As I remember him': A friend posted this picture to Facebook, saying this is how she'd remember Mr Mevoli . Mr Mevoli's lack of experience almost killed him last year, he wrote a blog post titled 'How I Got to 91 meters.' After reaching a depth of 88 meters, Mr Mevoli 'felt the effects of nitrogen narcosis at depth and at the same time realized that it was a long way up,' he wrote. He panicked and raced to the surface, which put him at an even greater risk for death, he soon 'had to be rescued at 28m, nearly 100 feet, blacked out and experienced a major lung squeeze.' 'You can’t lie to water,' Mr Mevoli wrote the episode taught him. 'Never lie to the water because you are only lying to yourself... come to the water willing to be consumed by it but also have confidence that your ability will bring you back.'","Nick Mevoli, 32, of Brooklyn, New York, had only been competitively diving since last year .

He continued: 'I vaguely know how CA employment law works and that you limit your liability by not stating a reason. It's also really hard to work through in your mind. 'The best theory I have is that, two weeks earlier, I raised concerns about donating 10 per cent of ad revenue to charity. Some management likes getting feedback, some doesn't. 'The reason I had concerns was that this was revenue, not income. That means you need - 10 per cent margins to break even. 'This can be hard to do; Yahoo and Twitter don't.

"Pressure is growing on George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, to deliver a tax break for married couples . At least three Cabinet ministers are backing demands for David Cameron to deliver a tax break for married couples within months. Allies of Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson and Chris Grayling indicated yesterday that they want the long-promised measure – worth £150 a year – to be introduced in the Budget in spring 2013. They spoke out as 15 MPs, including several ex-ministers, yesterday called in an open letter to Mr Cameron for the change to be introduced to Parliament as part of next year's finance bill. The intervention piles pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to placate social conservatives who are already enraged that he and Mr Cameron have made public statements in support of gay marriage, rather than recognising traditional marriage in the tax system. Mr Cameron has promised to introduce a transferable tax allowance for married couples in this Parliament and Treasury officials said yesterday that is still the Government's intention. But Tory right-wingers are concerned that the measure, which is opposed by the Liberal Democrats, will be left until the final budget before the 2015 election. Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Duncan Smith has privately indicated that this is unacceptable to him because it would mean taxpayers would not see the benefit before the election – due around May – allowing an incoming Labour government to easily reverse it. He also believes the measure would be dismissed as 'tokenism' if it was left until the dying days of the Coalition to be implemented. A friend of Mr Paterson, the Environment Secretary, said: 'He agrees with Iain on this.' And a source close to Mr Grayling, the Justice Secretary, said: 'Chris believes it's an important commitment for us to deliver.' The MPs backing the letter include former children's minister Tim Loughton, former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth and Nick de Bois, secretary of the 1922 Committee of back-bench MPs. The letter comes at a time of deep divisions in the Tory Party over social policy. Mr Osborne provoked a backlash earlier this week when he claimed the Conservatives have to back gay marriage if they want to win the election. He urged the party to emulate Barack Obama's socially liberal policies to win over young voters and women, who were credited with ensuring he retained the White House. Allies of Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson and Chris Grayling indicated yesterday that they want the long-promised measure worth £150 a year . Conservative Secretary of State for Justice Chris Grayling (centre), the former Minister of State for Work and Pensions, has, according to allies, indicated he wants the long-promised marriage tax break . And yesterday the boss of one of Britain's biggest polling companies accused Downing Street of misrepresenting its results of a survey on gay marriage. Mr Cameron said in a letter to former Welsh secretary Cheryl Gillan, who opposes gay marriage, that a ComRes poll found 10 per cent of current Conservative voters said the policy would make them less likely to vote Conservative compared with 7 per cent saying it would make them more likely. But ComRes boss Andrew Hawkins said yesterday Mr Cameron had got his figures wrong. He added that the policy 'loses the Party more votes than it gains', with 'former Conservative voters less likely to return to the fold'. Other ComRes polls showed it had a 'general detrimental impact on the Party's fortunes', he added. Proposals for gay marriage and the marriage tax break are expected to be introduced some time after the next Queen's Speech and before the general election. A senior Treasure source said: 'We are committed to recognise marriage in the tax system.'","A group of 15 senior Conservative MPs call on the PM to live up to his pre-election pledge .

"After Chris Everitt was put in charge of a failing school, he thought it would be a good idea to sit in on lessons to see how the teachers were faring. But now he is facing strike action after the teachers claimed such a move would put them under ‘intolerable’ pressure. Westwood Girls College was placed in special measures after it was rated inadequate by Ofsted in January. 'Inadequate': Teachers at Westwood Girls College are threatening three strikes over the next month . Mr Everitt was brought in at Easter as interim manager in an attempt to improve standards at the school in Upper Norwood, south east London. But teachers have responded angrily, threatening three walk-outs over the next month, when many pupils are taking their exams. Angry parents condemned the move. Lucia Castro, 40, said: ‘It seems that the school has started to pick up again recently. 'Outrageous': Education Secretary Michael Gove has condemned the industrial action . ‘Some of the teachers had it cushy all this time. They are being given more of a hard time now and they aren’t happy with it.’ Butt Rehmen, 41, said: ‘I don’t think they should go on strike – they should be monitored.’ Graham Cluer, of the NASUWT, said there had been a succession of interim heads at the school and each had carried out observations. ‘It is putting an intolerable workload and stress level on teachers,’ he claimed. Around 40 teachers at Westwood School, which has pupils aged from 11 to 16, will strike on May 22, June 6 and June 18. Staff from Harris Federation, an academy chain that is taking over the school in September, will hold some classes for older children and ensure exams can take place. But children in Years 7, 8 and 9 will have to stay at home. Mr Everitt, who is employed by the Harris Federation, said  ‘lesson observations’ were an ‘essential component’ of raising standards. The Ofsted report noted a string of failings, including too little being known about ‘the quality of teaching in the school’. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the threatened strikes were ‘outrageous’.","Headteacher Chris Everitt has been trying to improve the failing state school .

"Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney revealed today that he believed in his heart he was going to win the election and go on to the White House, and that ‘it kills me’ not to be president. The former GOP candidate, 65, said today in his first interview since losing the election that while he believed he was going to become commander-in-chief, early polling numbers spelled out trouble, and he began to have a ‘slow recognition’ that Barack Obama would win once seeing that Florida was a close race. In the interview with ‘Fox News Sunday,’ his wife Ann, 64, also confirmed during the show that she was approached by ABC’s ‘Dancing with the Stars,’ but turned it down, saying: ‘I would have loved to have done it…(but) I’m not really as flexible as I should be.’ Scroll down for video . Painful: Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney and wife Ann have given their first post-election interview to Fox News, both saying that losing hit them hard . FOX News Sunday's Chris Wallace sits down exclusively with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann Romney at their son's home in San Diego, CA for their first post-election interview to be presented on Sunday, March 3rd . The wide-ranging interview, led by Fox News’ Chris Wallace, was taped earlier this week and aired Sunday morning. It brushed upon Obama’s second term, current events, as well as the Romney’s newest grandchildren, among other things. The former Massachusetts governor . reflected over his campaign, saying that he did not do a satisfactory . job connecting with minority voters, and said that Republicans in . general must strive to do better in appealing to black and Hispanic . voters. 'That was a real mistake,' he said. He added: ‘It kills me not to be there, not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done.’ Romney later joked that he did better . in his second run for the White House than he did the first time around . - when he lost the 2008 nomination to Arizona Sen. John McCain. Regardless of his success making it as the GOP nomination, he said he . won’t run for a third time. He compared the . experience of running for the presidency to riding a roller coaster and told Wallace: ‘We were on a . roller coaster, exciting and thrilling, ups and downs. But the ride . ends, and then you get off. 'And it’s not like, “Oh, can’t we be on a . roller coaster the rest of our life?” It’s like, no, that ride’s over.’ Mistake: Romney, left, told Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, right, that one of his biggest campaign mistakes was not reaching out to minorities . Growing family: Seen cradling their two new grandchildren, the Romneys talked about their plans post-election . Ann compared the experience to the service that the Romneys have carried out within the Mormon church. ‘In our church, we’re used to serving . and you know, you can be in a very high position, but you recognize . you’re serving. And now all of a sudden, you’re released and you’re . nobody. And we’re used to that. It’s like we came and stepped forward to . serve. 'And you know, the other part of it . was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot . of passion and a lot of - a lot of people around us and all of a sudden, . it was nothing,’ she said. ‘But the good news is we like each other,’ she joked. Watershed moment: Romney's '47 percent' comments, made at a private fundraiser in Florida was one of the pivotal moments of the 2012 campaign . In a one-on-one portion of the interview, Wallace touched upon more sensitive issues, including what faults he believed Romney and his staff made on the campaign trail, including the leak of the now-infamous '47 percent' video where he said 'my job is not to worry about these people.' The video, which was leaked last September, represented a pivotal point in the 2012 campaign, and a watershed moment in Romney's campaign. 'There's no question that hurt, and did real damage to my campaign.' -Mitt Romney on infamous '47 percent' video . ‘It was a very unfortunate statement,' Romney told Wallace. 'It’s not what I meant. When you speak in private, you don’t think about how much things can be twisted and distorted. It was very harmful. My whole life has been devoted to helping people. There’s no question that hurt, and did real damage to my campaign.' But Romney was defiant in saying that his career in politics is not over. ‘I’m not going to disappear… I care about America. I care about the fact that we’re racking up larger deficits and putting the peril of the future generation very much in play.’ Concession: Romney conceded to Obama on Election Day from his campaign headquarters in Boston with Ann by his side . Signed, sealed, delivered: The Obamas and the Bidens celebrated onstage in Chicago after learning that they had won a second term in office . Sharing the next phase of their lives in their home in La Jolla, California, the couple additionally took a moment to present their family's latest additions after becoming grandparents to 20 children on Valentine's Day. The couple cradled their son Craig's newborn twins before the cameras, one seen in a pink blanket and the other in blue. 'This means everything,' Romney said, holding one of his grandchildren and smiling broadly. 'There’s nothing more spectacular than seeing new life coming into the family.' The family has kept a low profile since Romney's concession to Obama last November. The couple has been spotted doing ordinary things, such as going to see 'Twilight' and, most recently, shopping for cereal at Target. Romney lost to Obama by a margin of 332 to 206 electoral college votes, with around 62.6million Americans voting for Obama over Romney's 59.1million votes. He spent the month after the failed White House bid in solitude at his beachfront mansion in La Jolla, near San Diego, reflecting upon the campaign.

This is only the second time England have been to Tallinn but the first occasion we were there, on June 6, 2007 for a Euro 2008 qualifier, I realised that I could no longer carry on representing my country. That was the match that pushed me into international retirement. A fortnight earlier, I had just played in my second Champions League final in three years. That game against AC Milan came at the end of a season when my form had been consistently good, so I felt I had solid claims to be considered for a starting role for England.

Midfielder Joe Cole (second from left) is congratulated after scoring against Estonia at the A. Le Coq Arena . On the Friday before we headed out to Estonia, Wembley hosted its first England senior game since its redevelopment, against Brazil. Rio Ferdinand was injured and I thought I'd take his place alongside John Terry but I played right back and wasn't overly thrilled with my performance. I had hoped it was just an experiment but Ledley King retained his place next to Terry for the game in the Le Coq Arena, which England comfortably won 3-0. I stayed on the bench and when Steve McClaren made that decision, I knew the final nail had been put in the coffin for me, internationally. It was in Tallinn that I knew the time had come to concentrate solely on Liverpool. Carragher (right) had started at right back for England in a friendly with Brazil at Wembley five days earlier .

I've just got my copy of The Second Half and although I am only a couple of chapters into it, it has not disappointed. People have their own opinions of Roy and some would be fearful of him, given how outspoken he can be. I have always judged people how I find them and I can honestly say that I have never found a fault in him. During Euro 2012, I worked with him on ITV as a pundit. As you can imagine, he was never afraid to say what he thought but, away from the cameras, he was always good company and he enjoys talking about football. This latest book has generated a lot of headlines but I don't think it should be forgotten what a magnificent player Roy was.

Carragher (second from right) and Keane (right) worked together as ITV pundits during Euro 2012 . I would have loved to have been on the same team as him and it must have been a joy for centre backs to have him standing in front, for the cover he would provide. Do not underestimate, however, the skill he had. I noticed Wayne Rooney said in a recent interview that he regarded Roy as the best passer of the ball he played with and I could see no reason to argue with that claim as his distribution was magnificent. He had a fabulous career and I know I’m going to enjoy reading about it.

"A family pet dog was shot dead in his owner’s back yard by a policeman searching for a missing three-year-old boy. Sean Kendall, 27, met with Salt Lake City police officials this week to discuss the fatal shooting of his two-year-old Weimaraner, Geist. Police were searching for a three-year-old boy named Kelby who had been reported missing - he was eventually found asleep in his own basement. Killed: Sean Kendall's two-year-old Weimaraner, Geist, pictured here, was shot dead last week by a Salt Lake police officer . Sean Kendall, 27, (right)  met with Salt Lake City police officials this week to discuss the fatal shooting of his two-year-old Weimaraner, Geist, seen left here playing . Police said the officer who was searching in Kendall's yard felt the dog was aggressive and going to attack him, and that's why he shot the animal. Now Kendal is calling for the officer to be fired from the force, saying he is 'extremely frustrated and upset' at the apparent reluctance of the police to take action against the officer who shot his dog. 'The only thing that I would be satisfied with is having this officer terminated,' said Kendall, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. 'I feel that his judgment was completely inappropriate.' As police searched for the toddler, an officer entered Sean Kendall's yard (pictured) and he felt Geist, was aggressive, he shot the dog . Now Kendal is calling for the officer to be fired from the force, saying he is 'extremely frustrated and upset' at the apparent reluctance of the police to take action against the officer who shot his dog . Kendall told KSL said Geist had never been aggressive or lunged at anybody, so 'the idea that he attacked an officer — it just doesn't make sense,' he said. 'I believe my dog came out of the dog kennel to see what was going on, who was here, stopped right here, and those were his last moments.' Kendall said Geist had a single gunshot wound to the head. 'Just the sheer sight of seeing my dog there — it was traumatizing,' Kendall said. Another case: A Baltimore police officer was suspended in a case in which he and another cop allegedly slit a dog's throat. Owner Sarah Gossard said her dog Nala, pictured, went missing and she had been trying to track the Shar-Pei down . 'Now he's dead. I have him wrapped up in a blanket in the back of my truck, and now I have to go bury him.' Kendall’s attorney, Brett Boulton, said he believes his client should be compensated. 'Dog killer': Baltimore police officer Jeffrey Bulger, 49, was booked Wednesday on charges after slitting the throat of a dog in police custody . But Sgt. Greg Wilking said the officer did not break the law when he entered Kendall’s backyard. 'There are extenuating circumstances,' said Wilking reported The Salt Lake Tribune. 'A child is missing, and if you’re a parent, you would want us to look everywhere for your child. We wouldn’t want to leave any stone unturned.' Earlier this week a second Baltimore police officer was suspended in a shocking case in which he and another cop allegedly slit a dog's throat. The Baltimore Sun reports officer Thomas Schmidt has been placed on a paid administrative leave along with fellow officer Jeffrey Bolger who has been charged with animal cruelty. The pair allegedly held down and cut the throat of a Shar-Pei, with officials saying there was no reason to kill the dog if it was already restrained. Schmidt is a 24-year veteran of the Special Operations Section, serving alongside Bolger who was hired in 1992. The union did not provide information regarding the terms of Schmidt's suspension. The alleged attack happened on Saturday morning in Brewers Hill, a south-eastern district of the city, after police responded to a report of a woman being bitten. Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said officers gained control of the animal, a seven-year-old Chinese Shar-Pei, with a dog pole and an officer used a knife to cut the dog's throat. Late last night, Detective Jeremy Silbert issued a statement identifying that policeman as Bolger. Announcing that internal affairs were investigating the killing, Mr Palmere called the incident 'outrageous and unacceptable'. Witnesses told police that as Bolger got out of his vehicle, he said: 'I'm going to f****** gut this thing.' He waited until colleagues got control of the dog before bending down and slashing its throat with a knife, witnesses said. It bled to death before animal control arrived, police told the Baltimore Sun.","Sean Kendall's two-year-old Weimaraner, Geist was shot dead last week .

"Staff in at least 17 hospitals have been secretly banned from wearing veils, an investigation has found. Front-line NHS staff, including doctors and nurses, have been told they cannot wear a niqab – a full veil which covers the face – while in contact with patients. Some hospitals have gone as far as to say veils cannot be worn in any situation where communication is essential – including staff training. Ministers last night called for guidelines to ensure all patients can have ‘face-to-face’ contact with those who care for them. Staff in at least 17 NHS hospitals have been secretly banned from wearing veils, an investigation has revealed (file pic) In light of the findings by the Daily Telegraph, the Government ordered a review of all health service policies on workers’ uniforms. Regulators will be asked to draw up clear rules so that communication with patients is always given priority over the right of a nurse or doctor to wear a veil. The move comes at a time of increased public debate over Muslim head-dress,  following the  decision by a college in  Birmingham to scrap a ban on veils amid protests from students. David Cameron has indicated he would support public sector bodies wishing to ban staff from covering their faces. And earlier this week Nick Clegg said there were certain circumstances where it was ‘perfectly  reasonable for us to say the full veil is clearly not appropriate’. MPs have called for a national debate. There are 160 NHS trusts in England, all of which have no national guidance on uniform policies.

The vast majority leave such decisions to the discretion of local managers. In some cases, uniform policies specifically state that the veil can be worn by front-line staff for  religious reasons. But 17 NHS hospitals had clear policies stating that front-line staff should not be allowed to cover their faces while in direct contact with patients. Some went even further, to say that face veils should not be worn in situations where communication is essential, such as training. Many of the hospitals which have introduced explicit restrictions are in parts of the country that have high Muslim populations, such as East London, and Bradford and Dewsbury in Yorkshire. Dr Dan Poulter, the health minister, has ordered a review of all current healthcare guidance on the issue. He said: ‘I am proud of the rich ethnic diversity of our healthcare workforce and support appropriate religious and cultural freedoms, but a vital part of good patient care is effective verbal and non-verbal communication. ‘Being unable to see a healthcare professional’s face can be a barrier to good and empathetic communication with patients and their families. 'That is why I am writing to all healthcare regulators to ask them to look into this matter and to review their professional regulations, to ensure that there is always appropriate face to face contact between healthcare professionals and their patients.’ The policy, drawn up by Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation trust, which runs Bradford Royal Infirmary and St Luke’s Hospital, states: ‘To ensure effective communication, clothing which covers the face (veil/niqab) is not permitted for any staff in contact with patients, carers or visitors or for staff in other roles where clear face to face communication is essential, for example, training.’ Staff who wish to wear a veil when they are not working – such as in breaks, or during their lunch, or walking around the buildings – are told they may do so. However they should be prepared to remove their veil if asked to check their identity against their ID badge, according to the guidance drawn up last year. Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS trust, which runs three hospitals in the North West says face coverings should not be worn when delivering patient care in order to aid communication and minimise infection risks. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP for Totnes in Devon and a former GP, said: ‘I think the same rules should apply to everyone: if I chose to wear a balaclava to work that would not be acceptable. ‘There are many areas – the courts, schools and hospitals – where the veil is simply not appropriate because you need clear communication. Debate: Boris Johnson said it was 'totally wrong' for Muslim schools to force pupils to wear veils and burkas . Yesterday, the Mayor of London said it was ‘totally wrong’ for Muslim schools to force pupils as young as 11 to wear veils and burkas. Boris Johnson said they should not be compulsory, adding: ‘I don’t think it can be classed as any kind of uniform. That is against my principles and it’s against the principles of liberty that London should stand for.’ A row broke out after it was claimed that some independent secondary schools order girls to wear burkas outside school and headscarves in class. Two London schools, the £3,000-a-year Ayesha Siddiqa Girls School in Southall and the £1,900-a-year Madani Girls School in Whitechapel, were both said to enforce strict Muslim uniform policies. But teachers at Madani last night said the rules had been misinterpreted and that pupils were not forced to wear full-face veils.","NHS staff, including doctors and nurses, have been told the cannot wear a niqab - a full veil which covers the face - around patients .

"Chancellor George Osborne was forced to admit he will miss his target for getting debt under control by 2015, but some generous people are doing their bit by leaving money in their will for the public finances . Dead Britons have left George Osborne £54,000 to help pay off the ballooning national debt from beyond the grave. The Treasury has revealed how members of the public have change their wills to insist some of their savings should be used to assist the country’s finances. But with the debt mountain topping £1trillion and rising, officials admit the bequests in 2010-11 are a drop in the ocean, accounting for 0.0000054 per cent of the total bill. The Chancellor was forced to admit this week that he will miss his target to get the debt mountain under control by the next election. Low growth and higher-than-expected borrowing means the age of austerity will now stretch until 2018, when official figures show the national debt will stand at more than £1.4trillion. Now the Treasury has revealed how some people are doing their bit to clear the nation’s debts. Treasury minister Sajid Javid said that in 2010-11 members of the public gave more than £1million to the government as a gift to the nation, almost all left in wills. And £54,634.36 was specifically set aside ‘for the reduction of the national debt’. It is not known exactly how many people left money in their will, but it is thought it could be dozens. It is the first time details of donations to Mr Osborne’s Treasury have been revealed. In the first decade of this century, the Treasury received donations of more than £7million from people wanting to help pay off the nation’s debts. It included a £2million anonymous donation in 2000-01 and £1 in tooth fairy money by six-year-old Niamh Riley from Salford. In 2007-08, the Treasury received £864,255 towards the debt but the following year just £180 was donated. The US Government has been publicly asking for help with its national debt for half a century. In the first year of the coalition, the Treasury received bequests worth £54,634.36 ¿for the reduction of the national debt¿ . But the Treasury stressed it was not actively encouraging Britons to follow suit. A spokesman said: ‘We are not talking about huge sums here. The government’s priority is putting the public finances and public spending on a sustainable path.’ Mr Javid revealed the paltry sum donated in 2010-11 in a parliamentary answer. He said: ‘A total of £1,083,537.55 was received by the Government as gifts to the nation in the financial year 2010-11. ‘Of this at least £1,081,311.84 was received from the estates of deceased persons, and £54,634.36 was received as bequests for the reduction of the national debt.’ Public sector debt as a proportion of GDP is not expected to start falling until 2016-17, a year later than Mr Osborne planned . This table shows how the Office for Budget Responsibility changed its debt forecasts this month, painting a bleaker picture than in March . He was responding to Labour frontbencher Gavin Shuker who asked about gifts made to the Government from the estate of people who had died and other payments made to the Government on a voluntary basis. Mr Shuker told MailOnline: ‘This Tory-led government is going to add more to the national debt in five years than Labour did in thirteen. ‘It's incredibly generous of these people to donate funds to clearing the national debt. Unfortunately the figure they gave was borrowed by George Osborne every ten seconds. ‘We're either going to need a lot more publicly spirited people giving their money away - or a proper plan for jobs and growth.’ In a key fiscal target, Mr Osborne said that by 2015-16, government debt as a proportion of the entire economy (GDP) would start falling. But the OBR said that net debt will be 74.7 per cent of GDP this year, then 76.8 per cent next year and 79 per cent in 2014-15 and 79.9 the following year. It will not fall until 2016-17 when it is forecast to drop to 79.2 per cent in 2016-17 and 77.3 per cent in 2017-18. Mr Osborne told the Commons: ‘In short, the tougher economic conditions mean that while our deficit is forecast to go on falling, instead of taking three years to get our debt falling, it’s going to take four.’","Chancellor forced to admit in his Autumn Statement that he will not meet his target to get debt under control by 2015 .

"Police in Brazil have launched a manhunt after the severed head of a former professional footballer was left on the doorstep of his home. The horrified wife of Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos, 35, made the gruesome discovery as she left the house in Rio de Janeiro for work early yesterday morning. The player's eyes and tongue had been cut out and his head placed inside one of his own rucksacks, police said. Mr Santos retired from football two years ago after a successful career playing for several teams in Rio de Janeiro, as well as for clubs in Sweden and Honduras. Scroll Down for Video . Beheaded: The head of former footballer Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos, was found early this morning on his wife's doorstep . He had recently set up his own business selling health foods and dietary supplements. Police said today that Mr Santos is believed to have been snatched from outside the shop he had opened in the Realengo district of Rio as he closed up at around 7.45pm on Monday. Witnesses said they saw several men bundling him into his car, a Hyundai i30, and speeding off just before midnight, a spokesman said. He was reported missing by his wife at 9pm on Monday. Mr Santos' brother-in-law, who didn't want to be named, told Brazil's Globo G1 website that the player's wife, Geisa Silva, 31, stayed up all night after her husband failed to arrive home. He said: 'Every time a car passed by she would go to see. 'She was getting ready to go to work at around 5.30am when she heard a noise, opened the front door and saw his rucksack. 'When she opened it she discovered it . contained his head. 'I did not want to look but the people who saw it . said they had gouged out his eyes and cut off his tongue,' said the . horrified relative. Neighbours living close to the crime scene reported hearing a woman screaming: 'My God, it's Joao! It’s Joao’s head.' Motive? Police are investigating if the murder is linked to Santos' wife's work to reclaim favelas from drugs gangs . Shanty town: Shacks sit stacked atop each other in Catumbi, a favela in Rio . 'From what I know, he didn't have any enemies and neither did his wife,' the relative added. In a statement Mr Santos' widow said the couple had not been subjected to any threats. Lead murder investigator Rafael Rangel . from the 14th Military Police Battalion (BPM) in Rio, said witnesses . saw armed men kidnap the businessman. 'We believe that the people who took him knew the family’s routine,' said Rangel. Investigators are working on the hypothesis that Mr Santos could have been murdered by a drugs gang because of Mrs Silva's work at a military police base in a local slum. The Police Pacification Unit in the Morro do Sao Carlos is one of dozens set up in Rio's favelas to retake control of the city's slums from violent drug traffickers. However, according to police chief Rafael Rangel, Mrs Silva worked as a social worker in the base and didn't patrol the streets or make arrests like other police officers. He told Brazil's O Dia newspaper the motives of the murder are still unclear. He said: 'Mrs Silva has no idea who would have done this. Neither she, her husband or any other member of the family have suffered any type of threat as far as she knows. 'There is nothing that would justify such a barbarous crime.' Santos did not have a police record. Crime . ridden: Brazil still has an alarmingly high murder rate, and armed . thefts and carjackings continue to be facts of daily life . Later today Brazilian police said body parts dumped beside a city river were believed to be those of Mr Santos. The player's brother-in-law told Brazil's Globo G1 website that family members had positively identified a torso found next to the Guandu river in Queimados, greater Rio de Janeiro, by a birth mark on Mr Santos' stomach. A police spokesman said other body parts had also been found in the area and were being DNA tested. He said the murder bears the hallmarks of an execution by drug gangsters, but stressed that ""every line of investigation"" is still open. The couple had been together for 11 years and were described as ‘lovely’ by neighbours. 'They were a happy, quiet couple,' said a neighbour, who asked not to be identified. 'But you never know what may have motivated a crime as stupid and as senseless as this.' Mr Santos’ played as a professional footballer between 1996 and 2005 - during which he scored 33 goals in 103 matches as a striker.  Nicknamed Humble Hero, he was signed to a number of second division teams. He also played abroad for Swedish Club Oster Vaxjo  and Olimpia in Honduras. A recent United Nations report into drug trafficking-related crime in Brazil found that more than half of the homicides, robberies and thefts have a direct or indirect link with this criminal activity.","Witnesses saw armed men kidnap Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos on Monday .

"Russia has brought in a new treason law which opponents say Vladimir Putin (pictured) will use it to silence his critics . Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a new treason law which opponents say could be used to smother dissent and put anyone who has contact with foreigners at risk. The law means Russians representing international organisations could be charged with treason. The maximum sentence for the offence is 20 years in prison. The law was published in the official government gazette  yesterday, despite a promise by Mr Putin on Monday that he would review it. Political opponents and rights activists say the legislation is the latest in a series of laws cracking down on the opposition and reducing foreign influence since Mr Putin returned to the Kremlin in May for a six-year third term. ‘Citizens recruited by international organisations acting against the country’s interests will also be considered traitors,’ the official gazette, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, said on its website. At a meeting of his human rights council on Monday, Mr Putin listened to a retired Constitutional Court judge’s concerns about the legislation, which she said did not require authorities to prove a suspect damaged state security. Mr Putin indicated that he would move cautiously, but also said ‘nonetheless, I am ready to return to this again, to look more attentively’. Russian officials have said the law is needed to help prevent  foreign governments using organisations in Russia to gather state secrets. The legislation allows Russians representing international organisations to be charged with treason, as well as those working for foreign states and bodies, and expands the range of actions that can be considered treasonous. Putin signed the law on Tuesday and it took effect on Wednesday when it was published in the official gazette, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, despite a promise by the president on Monday that he would review it. 'It's an attempt to return not just to Soviet times but to the Stalin era, when any conversation with a foreigner was seen as a potential threat to the state,' said Lyudmila Alexeyeva, 85, a former Soviet dissident and veteran human rights activist. She said it would probably be used selectively against Kremlin critics and others 'who irritate the authorities'. Political opponents and rights activists say the legislation is the latest in a series of laws intended to crack down on the opposition and reduce foreign influence since he returned to the Kremlin in May for a six-year, third term (above) Dmitry Oreshkin, a political analyst . sympathetic with anti-Putin protests this year, said the motivation . behind the law was that 'the state is more important than its citizens, . so there must be as much control over citizens as possible'. The . law was backed by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the main . successor of the Soviet KGB, and landed on the desk of longtime KGB . officer Putin after being approved by both houses of parliament in the . space of nine days last month. The FSB, in a rare public comment, was . quoted by state-run news agency Itar-Tass as saying the law had been . updated after being unchanged since the 1960s because 'foreign . intelligence agencies' methods and tactics for gathering information . have changed'. Putin . whipped up anti-U.S. sentiment during his campaign for the March . presidential election, and Russian officials have said the law is needed . to help prevent foreign governments using organisations in Russia to . gather state secrets. 'Citizens . recruited by international organisations acting against the country's . interests will also be considered traitors', Rossiyskaya Gazeta said in a . commentary on its website. Putin . has frequently accused Western nations of seeking to undermine Russia's . security and weaken the nuclear-armed nation, and has suggested they . use non-governmental organisations to do so. Moscow ordered the U.S. Agency for International Development to cease its Russian operations in October, accusing it of seeking to influence elections. In July, Putin signed a law requiring foreign-funded NGOs deemed to be engaging in political activity to register as 'foreign agents', and critics say other legislation is also aimed at silencing opponents. The United States and the European Union have criticised the laws, and expressed concern about criminal charges laid against several opposition leaders in the last few months. During his election campaign, Putin faced protests which at times drew tens of thousands of people into Moscow's streets, and he accused the United States of whipping up demonstrations against his rule. The maximum sentence for high treason remains 20 years, but the legislation signed by Putin also introduced prison terms of up to eight years for Russians acquiring state secrets in certain ways even if they are not passed on to foreigners. It broadened the spectrum of actions that can attract treason charges to include giving 'financial, material, technical, consultative or other aid' to a government or organisation deemed to be seeking to undermine Russian security. Those changes, as well as the removal of the stipulation that actions must be aimed against Russia's 'external' security to be considered treasonous, have raised concerns the law could be applied broadly to punish government opponents. At a meeting of his human rights council on Monday, Putin listened to a retired Constitutional Court judge's concerns about the legislation, which she said did not require authorities to prove a suspect damaged state security. But although Putin said he would look again at the law, his spokesman said he had signed it a day later. 'It's not the first time Putin has said the right words while slowly tightening the screws,' Alexeyeva said.","Critics say President will use it to silence critics and reduce foreign influence .

"You might need to dig out those sunglasses earlier than expected this year. Scientists believe there is a 75 per cent chance that 2014 will be the hottest on record. That’s because the menacing El Niño weather pattern seems to be ready to blow huge amounts of heat into the atmosphere. The image shows what happens when a El Nino strikes surface waters in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Warm water anomalies (red) develop in the Central Pacific Ocean. Winds that normally blow in a westerly direction weaken allowing the easterly winds to push the warm water up against the South American Coast . An El Niño occurs when equatorial Pacific waters are unusually warm. It can change ocean and wind currents across the globe, wreaking havoc on the climate. Scientists in Germany now believe they can forecast disruptive El Niño events a year in advance, according to a study in PNAS. They hope the forecast could allow countries to develop better strategies that can counter the devastating effects of an El Niño event. Scientists commonly forecast El Niño, which means ‘little boy’ in Spanish, about six months in advance, but long-term predictions have so far been tricky. Scientists in Germany recently said they can forecast disruptive El Niño events a year in advance. They hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires, pictured in the Philippines. Meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 El Niño will be firmed up 'in the next month or two' During an El Niño event the trade winds weaken. Warm, nutrient-poor water is not pushed westward and comes to occupy the entire tropical Pacific Ocean. The cold water is not forced to the surface and the coastal waters of Peru and Ecuador are unusually warm. This warmer water has a devastating impact on their fishing crops which rely on cool waters to thrive. The region also experiences an extremely higher than average amounts of rainfall. The name El Nino is believed to have been coined in the 19th century after Peruvian fisherman observed it around Christmas. The word is Spanish for 'boy' in reference to the infant Jesus Christ. Up until now, scientists have forecast the event by analysing water temperatures in the eastern Pacific, along the equator. But because water temperature is strongly influenced by the winds blowing across the equator, predictions have been limited to six months or less. Instead of analysing the water temperature in a specific area of the Pacific Ocean, Armin Bunde of Justus Liebig University in Giessen, Germany, and his colleagues looked at the atmospheric temperatures in all areas of the Pacific. They then looks at how the temperatures in the El Niño basin are linked to the temperatures in the rest of the Pacific area. The researchers claim their method correctly predicted the absence of El Niño events over the past two years, and forecast about a 75 per cent chance of an El Niño in late 2014. Climatologist Tim Barnett at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, told LiveScience that the methods the researchers employed were outdated. ‘The techniques the researchers used made me feel like I was back in the 1980s and 1990s,’ Mr Barnett said in an interview. The warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean are seen in this map of ocean temperatures taken by satellite in 2006. Redder spots are where temperatures are warmer than normal . A separate study has found that extreme weather events fuelled by El Niños are expected to double. Climate scientists warned that countries could be struck by devastating droughts, fires and foods every ten years. Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Ninos, which first appear in the western Pacific. The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Others argue that this approach does not look at the physics of the seas or atmosphere, but only looked for statistical patterns in temperature – which they claim can always be found if you look hard enough. ‘The risk of an El Nino event in the second half of 2014 has increased, but it's certainly not guaranteed at this point in time,’ said Andrew Watkins, Supervisor, Climate Prediction at Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. Mr Watkins said early indications suggested that the weather pattern could arrive as early as June, though the prospect would not become clear until the second quarter. Last month, a separate study found that extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong El Niños are expected to double. Climate scientists warned that countries could be struck by devastating droughts, wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years. An international team of scientists from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (CoECSS), the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and CSIRO, has spotted a link between global warming and extreme El Niño events. ‘We currently experience an unusually strong El Niño event every 20 years. Our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years,’ said Agus Santoso of CoECSS, who co-authored the study.","Event occurs when equatorial Pacific .

"Radical action: Deputy governor of the Bank of England Paul Tucker said a reduction of the base rate to below zero should be considered . Negative interest rates could become a reality in an ‘extraordinary’ move by the Bank of England to kick-start the economy, one of its senior officials revealed yesterday. Deputy governor Paul Tucker said a reduction of the base rate to below zero should be considered four years after it was cut to a record low of 0.5 per cent. But the very suggestion that million of savers should suffer fresh hits to their hard earned nest eggs caused outrage last night. Critics said prudent savers and pensioners have been punished enough by rates kept deliberately low to help support borrowers and the wider economy. If the base rate did become negative, it would mean major banks would have to pay the Bank of England to hold their money. The idea is that this would encourage them to lend more to stimulate both business and house buying. But already low saving accounts rates would be slashed to virtually zero – meaning their value would be outstripped by the rate of inflation. Mr Tucker also said the Bank stood ready to turn on the printing presses for a fourth time and add to the £375billion of emergency funds it has already pumped into the economy through three rounds of quantitative easing. A sub zero rate could also drive down the cost of mortgages for millions of borrowers – although it is highly unlikely that mortgage rates would also turn negative. Mr Tucker insisted that such ‘radical’ action must be ‘thought through carefully’ by the rate-setting monetary policy committee. But it is thought senior executives at the Bank are keen to show they have not run out of ideas of how to stimulate the sickly economy. ‘We are not stuck in the mud,’ said a well-placed source. To encourage lending: If the base rate did become negative, it would mean major banks would have to pay the Bank of England to hold their money . Mr Tucker raised the prospect of negative interest rates to MPs on the Treasury Select Committee in the wake of the loss of Britain’s gold-plated AAA credit rating. The economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 – rounding off the worst four-year period outside the aftermath of war for more than 100 years. Chancellor George Osborne is under mounting pressure to breathe life into the economy in next month’s Budget to avoid a triple-dip recession. But the Bank is also facing calls to do more to support the recovery. To avoid a triple-dip recession: Chancellor George Osborne is under mounting pressure to breathe life into the economy in next month's Budget . Negative interest rates would mean the central bank charges banks to hold their money and could encourage them to lend more to households and businesses instead. It would also lower interest rates banks pay out to savers as well as borrowing costs for households and businesses, potentially encouraging households to spend. The Bank has so far shied away from taking such action due to the damage it could do to UK building societies, which rely heavily on attracting deposits from savers. But Mr Tucker told MPs: ‘I hope that we will think about the constraints of setting negative interest rates. This would be an extraordinary thing to do and it needs to be thought through carefully.’ Simon Rose, from campaign group Save Our Savers, said he was ‘flabbergasted’ by Mr Tucker’s suggestion, adding: ‘This would be disastrous not only for savers but for the UK economy.’ Inflation has been above the 2 per cent target since late 2009 and the Bank this month said it expected it to stay there until 2016 – eating into workers’ pay and savers’ nest eggs. A cut in interest rates would benefit borrowers, particularly those on tracker mortgages. The cheapest tracker available at the moment is from ING Direct and charges Bank rate plus 1.44 per cent for two years – or 1.94 per cent today. It is improbable the Bank would cut rates so far into negative territory to make even the cheapest of mortgages fall below zero. A rate of between minus 0.25 per cent and minus 0.5 per cent is seen as the limit because beyond this it would be cheaper for banks to store their money in cash rather than at the central bank – rendering the official Bank rate all but useless. Analysis by Alex Brummer . Paul Tucker may have missed out on the top job at the Bank of England but he is clearly determined to show he has plenty of ideas to kick-start the lagging British economy. Amid an array of new tools mentioned by the deputy governor of the Bank of England is a possible experiment with negative interest rates that caught the eye. Such a radical policy would be to discourage banks from holding on to spare cash thereby forcing them to lend. But by penalising people with savings it might encourage them to consume more rather than hold cash on deposit. Severe on savers: By penalising people with savings, such a radical policy might encourage them to consume more rather than hold cash on deposit . Tucker is concerned that despite all the . efforts by the authorities to get banks to lend to small and medium . sized enterprises the flow of cash has not been strong enough to . encourage entrepreneurship and growth. Negative interest rates, that have been tried in the past by Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and Japan, effectively act as a tax on the banks keeping large deposits with the Bank of England. With the onset of the financial crisis more than five years ago and the deepening of the problems in the eurozone UK banks have become more distrustful of lending funds to other banks and many have been holding larger than usual balances with the Bank of England. With the onset of the financial crisis and deepening problems in the eurozone UK banks have become more distrustful of lending funds to other banks . Negative rates would, if they worked as . expected, improve the flow of lending and lower the cost of business . loans. However, it would not make the Bank any more popular among savers . who have seen returns decimated in recent times. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has held the base rate at 0.5 per cent for four years. But that is still higher than the US central bank the Federal Reserve that has been targeting interest rates at between zero and 0.25 per cent. Savings rates at the commercial banks and building societies already sit at record lows and are effectively in negative territory already because of the pernicious effect of inflation. With consumer prices currently rising at 2.7 per cent, savers need returns higher than that to be in positive territory. Tucker also signalled the Bank is looking at other methods of improving the finances of struggling smaller business. An expansion of the £80billion Funding for Lending scheme that has helped restart the housing market is one possibility. An immediate consequence of a decision to introduce negative interest rates would be to exert downward pressure on the pound on foreign exchange markets. In much the same as it would discourage UK high street banks to hang onto to surplus cash it would also discourage investors from overseas keeping their surpluses with British banks. Indeed, Tucker’s comments caused a brief wobble in the pound on the foreign exchange markets in latest trading. This despite the fact negative rates are just an idea that given the harsh impact on ordinary depositors will struggle to find political support.","Critics say prudent savers and pensioners have been punished enough .

"They died of infectious diseases and childbirth in medieval Edinburgh, some 600 years ago. But now some of the skeletons of almost 400 men, women and children, whose remains were unearthed in a cemetery five years ago, have been brought back to life thanks to digital faces created by forensic artists. By examining the remains, experts from the University of Dundee have revealed how the individuals lived and died, as well as what some of them would have looked like. Experts from the University of Dundee have reconstructed the faces of Medieval Scots living in Edinburgh and Leith using chemical analysis and cutting edge computer equipment. This boy was aged between 13 and 17 when he died and could have been a patient at a medieval hospital . They are based on the remains of medieval Scots unearthed in a Leith cemetery five years ago. A forensic pathology report was done on all of the remains, allowing scientists to gain information about the population. Strontium and Isotopic analysis was used to determine the lifestyle of the people. Scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues, before using a computer programme to rebuild the people’s faces. The graves of 390 people were discovered in the grounds of South Leith Parish Church in 2009, when work was underway for Edinburgh’s new tramline. They date from between the 15th and the 18th century and were found beneath Constitution Street. It has taken scientists five years to put a face to some of the medieval Scots. Archaeologist John Lawson told Edinburgh Evening News: ‘We have had a forensic pathology report done on all of the remains and that is allowing us to gain information about the population.’ Among the skeletons was one of a boy who died aged between 13 and 17 in around 1400. The date of his death indicates that he could have been a patient at a medieval hospital on the site, or one of the first burials associated with Leith Parish Church, Culture 24 reported. Scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues, before using a computer programme to rebuild the people's faces. This is the face of a a woman aged between 25 and 35 whose body was buried in a mass grave with two others and a child .

The face of a man who died before his 35th birthday between the mid 16th and mid 17th century was also reconstructed (pictured) Forensic artist Paloma Joana Galzi was involved in the project. She specialises in facial recognition and reconstruction, post-mortem sketches and studied Forensic Arts in Scotland, which is the only place in the world to offer this specific qualification and training. Together with other experts, she reconstructed the face of a woman aged between 25 and 35 whose body was buried in a mass grave with two others and a child. It is likely that she was a victim of a disease that swept the city and was 1.5 inches shorter than the average woman of the time, at 4ft 11 inches. Mr Lawson explained that most of the dead would have been victims of disease and some women would have died in childbirth. Around 90 per cent of the medieval population died before they were 45. Dr Kate Britton, of Aberdeen University, who was also involved in the project, said chemical analysis shows that four in five of the victims were local to Leith or Edinburgh and ate a diet mostly made up of dairy and meat. Mr Lawson told STV: ‘The results have shed new light on the lives of the medieval population in one of Scotland's largest and most important ports.’ ‘It has allowed us to highlight the lives of the ordinary person in Leith, by putting a face to these individuals and showing how they lived and died.’ Edinburgh's Old Town and Leith both have Medieval buildings, including parts of the famous castle which was a residence at the time.

"A worker at the Fukushima nuclear plant accidentally pushed a button turning off power to the four badly damaged reactors yesterday. Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority said that a worker carrying out inspections had turned off pumps injecting cooling water into the unstable reactors. The plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co, or Tepco, pours hundreds of tonnes of water a day over the reactors to keep them cool after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered meltdowns and explosions. A worker at the Fukushima plant accidentally turned off power to key cooling systems yesterday, but Japan's nuclear regulator sought to reassure people that a backup system had immediately kicked in . Despite the employee's blunder, officials say a backup system kicked in immediately. It is just the latest in a string of worrying mishaps which reveal just how vulnerable the power plant still is, two years on from the disaster. Earlier this year, Tepco lost power to cool spent uranium fuel rods at the plant after a rat tripped an electrical wire. And just last week the company also found that 430 litres of highly radioactive water had leaked from one of the hastily built storage tanks. Reactors three (left) and four (right) were badly damaged in the natural disaster which caused the worst nuclear emergency since Chernobyl in 1986 . The tank lacked a gauge designed to warn people when it is dangerously full, meaning workers overfilled it. TEPCO said the water spilled out of a concrete barrier surrounding the tank and believed that most of it reached the sea via a ditch next to the river. A further 300 tonnes of contaminated water leaked into the ocean back in August, which is on top of the 300 tonnes of groundwater which the company admitted could be seeping into the ocean per day. Japan's government stepped up support for the embattled utility last month, pledging half a billion dollars to help contain contaminated water. Fires burned for days at the plant following the 2011 crisis as workers struggled to cool the nuclear fuel . As well as battling to keep the reactors stable, Tepco is also in the middle of a complex decommissioning plan which could take decades to complete. Yesterday's mistake has seen the company's shares drop 7.6 per cent as confidence drains away from the embattled energy provider. The continuing disaster is the worst nuclear accident anywhere in the world since an explosion at now-infamous Russian power station Chernobyl in 1986. Fires burned for days at the shattered plant while workers slept in contamination masks on lead floors just 300 meters from the reactors which spewed radiation into the atmosphere. They were left to survive on emergency rations after drivers, fearing radiation poisoning, refused to take supplies to the site. Conditions got so bad that an army of hundreds of pensions - dubbed the 'suicide corps' - volunteered to take on work to spare the 1,000 or so younger people who were drafted in. The mistake highlights just how vulnerable the power station still is, even two years on from the disaster. Tokyo Electric Power Company are in the process of decommissioning the plant, but admit it may take decades (picture from 2011) The dangers faced by those at the site was underlined in July this year when Masao Yoshida, the boss of Fukushima, died from cancer aged just 58. Yoshida stayed at his post following the tsunami and lead efforts to stabilise the reactors, despite fearing several times that he and his workers would be killed and the crisis went from bad to worse. Even now, levels of radiation around the plant are dangerously high. In January this year a fish caught in the ocean nearby had 2,500 times the legal limit of radiation allowed for human consumption. A series of nets have been installed under the water to prevent the contaminated fish migrating, but scientists are still worried these fish could be eaten by larger predators, passing the radiation along. The fish showed no signs of mutation, and so would be indistinguishable from a healthy animal.","Worker accidentally pushed button cutting power to water pumps .

"Secret Foreign Office files detailing CIA rendition flights on UK territory have been accidentally destroyed, a minister said last night. Mark Simmonds claimed that documents about US prisoners flown in and out of the British island of Diego Garcia had been ‘water damaged’. Recent reports suggest the tiny territory in the Indian Ocean will be identified as the location of a secret prison used as part of the rendition programme, in a forthcoming report by the US Senate. This has always been denied by the Government. Island: The documents focus on flights to and from Diego Garcia, a tiny territory in the Indian Ocean . Rendition is the practice of taking terror suspects to be interrogated in other countries with less stringent human rights regulations. It was said to have been used to allow the torture of suspects. In 2008, David Miliband, the then Foreign Secretary, had to admit that Diego Garcia had been used twice in 2002 for re-fuelling of rendition flights in the months after the 9/11 terror attacks. Overthrown: Colonel Gaddafi of Libya in 2009 . Ministers have consistently denied prisoners ever left the plane or set foot there. But since then there appear to have been more flights. Documents uncovered after the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi in Libya in 2011 suggest the US sought to use Diego Garcia as a stopover during the 2004 rendition of Abdel Hakim Belhadj, a leading Gaddafi opponent, and his pregnant wife. The pair are taking legal action against M16, which is also being investigated by Scotland Yard. Mr Simmonds, a Tory minister in the Foreign Office, said in response to a written parliamentary question that files on flights in and out of the territory from 2002 – which could have implicated UK officials – were ‘incomplete due to water damage’. The admission is particularly embarrassing given MPs are demanding the Home Office urgently provide more information about 114 ‘missing’ files that could have contained information about an alleged child abuse network in the 1980s. Cori Crider, director of the charity Reprieve and lawyer for Mr Belhadj said: ‘It’s looking worse and worse for the Government on Diego Garcia. First we learn the Senate’s upcoming torture report says detainees were held on the island, and now – conveniently – a pile of key documents turn up missing with  “water damage?” ‘The Government might as well have said the dog ate their homework. This smacks of a cover-up.’ The island was purchased by Britain in the 1960s and all the islanders evicted. It has hosted a US naval base for decades but using it for rendition would still breach international and UK law.","Documents held details of prisoners flown through island of Diego Garcia .

"The Queen and Prince Charles have been given at least 39 chances to veto legislation before it became law, it was revealed today. Secret papers show the most senior Royals have had numerous opportunities to torpedo bills that could change their powers, including a law that would have given parliament sole authority to sanction strikes on Iraq during the 1999 war. The extent of the influence the Queen and . Prince Charles have over legislation has been laid bare . because Downing Street lost a legal battle to keep details secret. Revealed: The Queen and Prince Charles have been asked to consent at least 39 laws, some of which they have vetoed, Cabinet documents show . Ministers and Whitehall mandarins must . ask them to approve or veto legislation across most areas of government . if it may impact on their interests, like the Crown estate and the . Prince's Duchy of Cornwall estate. The Queen's veto blocked the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill in 1999, a backbench bill making it necessary that Parliament must first consent before Tony Blair's government could launch air strikes against Saddam Hussein's Iraq. It was put forward by anti-war Labour MP Tam Dalyell but it failed as it did not receive the Royal Assent. Mr Dalyell said at the time: 'I am not going crawling to the Queen. This has nothing to do with her.' The Palace was also asked to agree bills linked to higher education, paternity pay, identity cards and child maintenance. The Whitehall legal pamphlet containing the information admits that if they do not give consent: 'a major plank of the bill must be removed'. System: The senior Royals are asked about legislation from Westminster that might have an impact on their own interests or estates . The Palace said today that Royals only use their veto if they are advised to by cabinet members or civil servants. But critics say it shows the amount of power in the monarchy's hands. Prince Charles has been criticised in the past for the number of letters he has written to ministers giving his views on policies. Influence: Cornish MP Andrew George says the revelations show the power the Queen and Prince Charles have over Parliament . Academic John Kirkhope, who fought the Government to release the documents, said: 'There has been an implication that these prerogative powers are quaint and sweet but actually there is real influence and real power, albeit unaccountable.' Andrew George, Liberal Democrat MP for . St Ives, part of which includes Duchy of Cornwall land, said: 'This is opening the eyes of those who believe the Queen only has a ceremonial role. 'It shows the Royals are playing an active role in the democratic . process and we need greater transparency in parliament so we can be . fully appraised of whether these powers of influence and veto are really . appropriate. At any stage this issue could come up and surprise us and . we could find parliament is less powerful than we thought it was.' The Queen's Duchy of Lancaster estate, which includes 19,000 hectares of land and 10 castles, pays for running Sandringham and Balmoral. Prince Charles's Duchy of Cornwall brings in £18million a year. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: 'It is a long established convention that the Queen is asked by parliament to provide consent to those bills which parliament has decided would affect crown interests. The sovereign has not refused to consent to any bill affecting crown interests unless advised to do so by ministers.' A spokesman for Prince Charles at Clarence House added: 'In modern times, the Prince of Wales has never refused to consent to any bill affecting Duchy of Cornwall interests, unless advised to do so by ministers. Every instance of the prince's consent having been sought and given to legislation is a matter of public record.'","Senior Royals offered veto over 39 policies that had impact on their power .

"Bubbly: Aldi's cut-price champagne has beaten a number of other more expensive bottles in a prestigious blind taste test . A bottle of Aldi bubbly which costs just £12.99 has beaten some of the world's most renowned champagnes in a blind taste test. The cut-price supermarket drink was voted by experts as better than other bottles, some of which were ten times more expensive. Judges at a leading food and wine competition described Aldi's Champagne Veuve Monsigny by Philizot and Fils as 'classy and complex'. It was said to offer an intense nose of baked apple, brioche and stone fruits with gorgeous flavours of apples, red fruit and minerality on the palate. The French bottle - on Aldi's own label - was awarded a silver medal at the prestigious International Wine Challenge 2013. The champagne was said to be better than many other typically posh bottles, including Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame 2004, which costs £130. Another of the beaten contenders included Moet and Chandon Imperial NV, which is priced at £32.99. Aldi spokesman Tony Baines said: 'We believe good quality and value are not mutually exclusive and these award wins support that belief. 'You don't need to pay superstar prices for super quality drinks. 'We'll be raising a glass of our Champagne Veuve Monsigny by Philizot and Fils to toast our success. 'We hope our customers will enjoy doing the same the next time they have a cause to celebrate.' The competition sees each medal wine tasted on at least three separate occasions by a minimum of ten of the finest wine tasters in the world. Last month Aldi was celebrating after its £10 bottle of gin beat some of the world's most highly-regarded spirits, which cost up to five times as much, in a blind taste test by adjudicators at the International Spirits Challenge. It was awarded a silver medal in the competition, the same as The London No.1 Gin, which sells for £35 at Harrods. The budget Aldi £9.65 Oliver Cromwell London Dry Gin has sold in the supermarket since 1999. It comes in 70cl bottles and is described as having a 'ripe, citrus aroma with rounded spice and a touch of juniper'. It is the only Aldi own label gin and is distilled for a 'clear, crisp, complex flavour'. Expensive: Aldi's champagne was rated higher than the more costly Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame 2004 (left) and Moet and Chandon Imperial NV (right) The Worship Street Whistling Shop Cream Gin, which costs £55.95, also won silver.

"Topless pictures of a Lebanese Olympic skier competing at the Sochi Winter Olympics have prompted calls for a ministerial inquiry in Beirut after they were leaked online. The photos of Jackie Chamoun, which were taken for a calendar, show her holding strategically-placed ski equipment to protect her modesty as she poses in Lebanon's Faraya mountains. But video of the photoshoot and stills from the film, which leave little to the imagination, emerged online this week and were featured on Lebanese television, sparking a flood of complaints. Scroll down for video . Risque: Topless pictures of Lebanese Olympic skier Jackie Chamoun have sparked calls for a ministerial inquiry after they were leaked online . Chamoun apologised for the video and stills in a statement published on Facebook on Tuesday, which she said showed the preparation for the photoshoot, rather than the final product. She wrote: 'The video and photos that you are now seeing are part of the making of the preparation. It wasn't supposed to go public. 'I want to apologise to all of you, I know that Lebanon is a conservative country and this is not the image that reflects our culture,' she added. Offensive: The photographs were taken for a calendar, but video footage of the shoot subsequently emerged online which left little to the imagination . The photographs show skier Jackie Chamoun holding strategically-placed ski equipment to protect her modesty as she poses in Lebanon's Faraya mountains . 'All I can ask to each of you who saw this is to stop spreading it, it will really help me focus on what is really important now: my training and race.' But the apology has not placated everyone, with Lebanon's Youth and Sports Minister Faisal Karami calling on Tuesday for an investigation into the photos to ensure 'the protection of Lebanon's reputation.' The Lebanese Olympic Committee was met yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue, and the head of the country's Olympic delegation said Chamoun had been barred from speaking to the media. Lebanon is considered among the most liberal countries in the Arab world, with women generally free to wear the skimpiest of attire, and alcohol widely available. The 22-year-old Chamoun is competing in her second Winter Olympics representing Lebanon at alpine skiing . Chamoun took to Facebook on Tuesday to publicly apologise for the video and stills, which she said showed the preparation for the photoshoot, rather than the final product. Banned: The head of Lebanon's Olympic delegation said Chamoun had been barred from speaking to the media. But the society remains culturally conservative by western standards and Chamoun's photos touched off a small firestorm. 'Stop all your trash,' Issam Merhi wrote on Chamoun's Facebook page, addressing her supporters.'What she has done is wrong, or else you would have all done it.' The 22-year-old Chamoun is competing in her second Winter Olympics representing Lebanon in alpine skiing. And despite the criticism levelled against her, plenty of fans offered their support online. 'Don't worry about nay sayers Jackie!' wrote Nicolas Rubeiz on her Facebook page. 'Cherish your independence and keep making us proud. You are causing no shame whatsoever to Lebanon.' And others ridiculed the idea of a ministerial investigation to protect Lebanon's reputation at a time when the country is being rocked by a string of car bombings and other violence. 'Weekly car bombs, not a big deal. #JackieChamoun in a slightly revealing photoshoot: scandal. #LebaneseProblem,' wrote Twitter user KareemVots.","Jackie Chamoun is shown holding strategically-placed ski equipment .

"Across the country, in the first election since both parties fully embraced the new world of campaign finance created by Supreme Court decisions, including Citizens United, the television ads during the campaign's final hours were practically nothing but politics. Total federal spending was expected to reach the $4 billion mark, pushing these midterm elections to record levels. Deep-pocketed donors funneled millions to outside groups, which in many races accounted for more than two-thirds of the spending in competitive races. In the 10 most expensive Senate races, nine have more than a dozen outside groups paying for ads. In eight of the 12 most expensive races, outside groups spent more than the actual people on the ballots did. Scroll down for video . Changing tides: The most expensive race for Senate in the nation had topped the $108 million mark by Monday. Of that, $76 million was coming from outside groups trying to shape the outcome of Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan's re-election bid in North Carolina against Republican state House Speaker Thom Tillis. MIdterm elections in 2014 have shaped up to be the most expensive ever as the new campaign finance landscape -- with the help of Super PACs and 'dark money' non-profits -- has become the norm for both parties. SUPER PACs . These groups can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to independently advocate the election or defeat of candidates. Thanks to Citizens United, as of 2010 their revenue streams can come from corporations. They are not tied to specific parties or candidates. The Democrats' biggest super PAC, Senate Majority PAC, has spent at least $5.5 million on the Arkansas race. In all, the group, which has ties to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, has unleashed $47.1 million to keep Democrats in control of the chamber. The Karl Rove-backed network of American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS has spent at least $4.6 million in Arkansas, part of the $46.7 million in spending it reported to the Federal Election Commission through Monday afternoon. 'DARK MONEY' These groups, unlike PACs, are not required to disclose the names of their top donors. A network of conservative groups backed by the billionaires Charles and David Koch, for instance, spent at least $400 million in the 2012 elections. Those 'dark money' groups, organized under section 501(c) of the tax code, differ from so-called 'Super PACs,' which can advocate directly for candidates, but must disclose the identity of their donors. For instance, the most expensive race for Senate in the nation had topped the $108 million mark by Monday. Of that, $76 million was coming from outside groups trying to shape the outcome of Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan's re-election bid in North Carolina against Republican state House Speaker Thom Tillis. As here in Arkansas, much of that cash came in the form of television ads that left voters overloaded. 'I've seen enough of them to last me a lifetime,' said 74-year-old retiree Bert Cole, who cast his ballot early in Jonesboro. 'I just hit the mute button and let them do their talking.' The pricey race in Arkansas between Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor and Republican Rep. Tom Cotton, as well as two competitive House contests and one for a soon-to-be-open governor's office, filled the air between Little Rock's television programs with enough ads this past weekend so that, theoretically, every targeted voter would see 34 political commercials a day. Holding Pryor's seat is crucial to Democrats' hopes of keeping their majority in the Senate. Should Republicans win here and pick up five seats elsewhere, they'll have control of the chamber for the first time since Democrats prevailed in the 2006 election. In all, more than 500 outside groups had reported federal spending from Alaska to Florida. That's why escaping politics on TV was next to impossible just about anywhere with a competitive race on Tuesday's ballot. In North Carolina, candidates and their allies have spent $62 million to run almost 102,000 ads this campaign season. Georgia has seen almost $43 million in ads, running some 65,000 times. And Kentucky has seen at least 79,000 ads at a cost of $34 million, according to an analysis from the Center for Public Integrity, using the widely accepted estimates from media tracking firm Kantar/CMAG. Pricey: Comparatively small Arkansas is spending FORTY times as much on television advertising than populous California this year as Rep. Tim Colton tries to take the Senate seat of Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor. In all, Pryor, Cotton and their supporters in Arkansas have spent more than $26 million to bombard viewers with roughly 60,000 messages. More than $56 million has been spent overall on the race . In all, Pryor, Cotton and their supporters in Arkansas have spent more than $26 million to bombard viewers with roughly 60,000 messages. More than $56 million has been spent overall on the race. Campaigns' last-minute efforts to find airtime guaranteed the total costs would spike at the end. Last week, Pryor spotted an available 30-second spot during 'The Voice' and shelled out the $4,400 station KARK demanded. Days later, Cotton bought a $15,000 ad during Saturday's 5 p.m. broadcast at the same station. And Fox's Little Rock affiliate KLRT charged Senate Majority PAC $11,000 for one spot during Sunday's NFL game. As the election gets closer, airtime becomes scarcer and prices go up. Many of the political groups planned ahead, but those that did not find themselves paying a premium. The House Democrats' campaign committee in the spring asked stations to set aside $1.5 million in ad time in the Little Rock area to saturate the market for five weeks. Months later, the Karl Rove-backed American Crossroads spent the same amount but got just one-third the airtime. The National Rifle Association came in even later and paid $1 million. That sum was worth just one week of ads. It's all too much for Fayetteville resident Geron Vail, who says that when a campaign ad comes on his TV, 'I flip.' The ads, which he describes as 'sad,' are even pestering the 55-year-old when he sits down at his computer. 'You can't even click on a website without getting it,' Vail said. 'You have to wait through 15 seconds before you can even watch something on YouTube.'","This year's election is the first in which both parties have fully embraced the new campaign finance landscape .

Celebrity chef Sandra Lee would later . stay in the finely appointed room on Friday, until learning it was the . very same in which Gandolfini took ill. When media learned that Lee had been so quickly placed in the suite, they pounced. Sources told the New York Post that Lee was ‘saddened’ when she learned of the fourth floor room’s recent history. Lee was in town with her sister and nieces. Room 449 was one of several she’d rented for their trip. As Italian media began to swarm, Lee and company left after only one night.

The actor's body left Rome's Fiumicino airport at around 1600 GMT (1200 ET) on a private flight, an airport official said. Family . friend Michael Kobold, speaking to reporters in Rome, thanked the . Italian authorities and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry for helping . to accelerate procedures. Gandolfini was set to receive an award at the festival. He instead received a tribute on Saturday. Gandolfini and his son toured the Vatican prior to his death as they awaited the arrival of his sister. Leta Gandolfini, one of the actor's two older sisters who both live in New Jersey, appeared grief-last stricken last week as she arrived at the morgue flanked by security guards.

'The . patient was considered dead on arrival, and for that reason an autopsy . has been requested to be carried out by a pathologist, as is normal . procedure in our country.' The alarm was first raised when son Michael called the hotel’s front desk after finding his father in the bathroom. The night before his death, Gandolfini dined with Michael in Rome's Trastevere neighborhood. His waiter Andrei Burca told the New York Post: 'He had a big smile, a big laugh, and looked happy.'

Gandolfini’s body was initially slated to be flown to the U.S.by Wednesday or Thursday, and his funeral held in New York. 'In Italy, it can take up to 10 days to get all the necessary documents and paperwork to repatriate the body. We are looking forward to working with the Italian government and officials to shorten that process,' family friend and spokesman Michael Kobold originally said. But, on Sunday, those plans appeared to accelerate. Happier times: Gandolfini's son Michael, center, found the star slumped in a Rome hotel bathroom June 19. The two were vacationing together in Italy prior to Gandolfini's slated acceptance of an award in Sicily . That's when Kobold told reporters that the 'provisional plan' is to depart Rome on Monday afternoon for the United States, several days earlier than anticipated. He did not specify which U.S. airport. The Italian news agency ANSA later released photos of the body departing Rome. The agency says the private plane took off at 6 pm Sunday. Its exact U.S. destination was unclear. A room at the Hotel Boscolo Exedra Roma costs about $671.

The actor rose to fame playing a . hitman in the 1993 film True Romance, and roles in films such as . Terminal Velocity and Get Shorty followed. However, it was not until his breakout role in 1999 in the hit television show The Sopranos that he  became a household name. Since 'The Sopranos' ended its six-season run in June 2007, Gandolfini had appeared in a number of big-screen roles, including the crime drama 'Killing Them Softly' and 'Zero Dark Thirty', a film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden.

"Pilots claimed yesterday that new European rules could force them to stay awake for 22 hours before landing a plane. The watering down of restrictions on flying hours and rest periods will make them over-tired and put lives at risk, they said. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) has released a dossier of near-disasters, including three pilots falling asleep at the same time on a transatlantic flight to Heathrow. 'Unsafe and discredited': British pilots union BALPA has lost its battle to persuade MEPs to vote against new European regulations for flying hours . In another incident, a pilot said he . and a colleague messed up a landing at the airport ‘with possible fatal . consequences’ because they were ‘punch-drunk with tiredness’. A . survey of 500 commercial pilots found 56 per cent had fallen asleep at . the controls and nearly one in three woke up to find their co-pilot had . also nodded off. Half said tiredness was the major threat to passenger . safety. But Balpa lost its . battle yesterday to persuade European MPs to vote against the . regulations, which will be brought in from 2015 unless they are rejected . by the European council of ministers later this year. The . new regime was voted through by 387 votes to 218, despite the European . parliament’s transport committee voting 21-13 against last week. Mixed messages: The decision comes despite the European Parliament's own transport committee voting by 21-13 to reject the EU plans amid safety fears . The . rules mean pilots can be asked to do seven early starts in a row – from . as early as 3am – rather than just three; and work up to 110 hours per . fortnight rather than 95, the union says. Restrictions . on how much time they can spend on standby, when a flight is delayed . due to adverse weather conditions or technical problems, will also be . lifted. This means that . in extreme cases they could be awake for 22 hours before touching down. On some long-haul flights the number of pilots required to be on duty . will be cut from three to two. Balpa . general secretary Jim Mc-Auslen said: ‘It is a scandal that the . unelected and unaccountable European Commission can force through cuts . to UK flight safety that have been rejected by MEPs on their own . transport committee, UK MPs, pilots across Britain and Europe, . scientists and the British flying public.’ Evidence: The testimony also follows publication by the CAA of an incident report from a Virgin Atlantic pilot flying an Airbus saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days . And . Louise Ellman, Labour MP and  chairman of the Commons transport select . committee, said: ‘I agree with Balpa’s concerns that the proposed . changes to EU rules could endanger passenger safety. There is still time . for the UK and Europe to think again.’ The . Government and the Civil Aviation Authority backed the shake-up. ‘Pilot . fatigue is a real risk in the aviation industry and we take the . management of fatigue very seriously,’ CAA chief executive Andrew Haines . said. ‘Fatigue has . multiple causes, and must be managed in a practical, hands-on way, not . simply by asking airlines and pilots to comply with a set of . timetables.’ Phil Bennion . MEP, Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, said: ‘This is a sensible . outcome. Despite concerns from pilots’ unions, these rules will not . lower safety standards.’","Comes despite EP's transport committee rejecting rules amid safety fears .

"Power promise: Energy minister Michael Fallon said there will be no industrial blackouts despite the 'risk' to electricity supplies . Britain will not be hit by 1970s-style industrial blackouts, energy minister Michael Fallon insisted today. The Tory MP admitted there was a 'risk' of power shortages in the UK within three years but insisted the Government would not let that happen. It comes after regulator Ofgem warned that electricity margins could tighten in 2015-16 to between around 2 per cent to 5 per cent depending on demand. Mr Fallon told BBC1's Sunday Politics: 'I don't agree there is a real risk. There is a risk of course. There is going to be less reserve capacity in three years time but we have got time to deal with that and we have got plans to deal with that.' Asked what chance there was of Britain being hit by blackouts, he replied: 'Oh, low. We are going to make sure they don't happen I can absolutely tell you.... 'We are not going to have industrial blackouts, factories shut at lunch time and people sent home or anything like that.' Mr Fallon insisted the Government had inherited a legacy of under-investment, claiming 'nothing was done under Labour'. Electricity supply: The government has claimed it inherited a legacy of under-investment, claiming 'nothing was done under Labour' He said six new gas plants, two . on-shore and two off-shore windfarms, and biomass fuel plants had opened . since the Coalition took power and more were in the pipeline. The . Conservative minister insisted that plans for industrial users to . switch off at times of high demand was a contingency plan that had been . in place for 20 years, though he conceded that had never been necessary. Earlier this week Ofgem said: 'The report shows that electricity supplies are set to tighten faster than previously expected in the middle of this decade. 'The risk to electricity supplies is projected to increase from the current near zero levels, although Ofgem does not consider disruption to supplies is imminent or likely, providing the industry manages the problem effectively.' Ofgem also highlighted uncertainty around supply and demand for electricity.","'There is going to be less reserve capacity in three years, but we have got time to deal with that' says Michael Fallon .

"It's breakfast time in Joyce’s Cafe and Arden Thompson and his buddies are chatting over eggs-over-easy and mugs of coffee. Dressed in patched jackets and well-worn cowboy boots, and their faces flushed from the snow-storm outside, they could be mistaken for poor farmers who once eked out a living in this remote corner of North Dakota. Until you hear their topics of conversations. It is not about the crops of wheat or barley they once tended but racehorses, second homes in the sun, the latest cruises they have been on and, most importantly, the size of their most recent cheques. Arden and his friends are all newly minted millionaires, a modern breed of oil baron made rich almost overnight by a ‘fracking boom’ that has turned North Dakota into America’s second-biggest oil producer. The US is enjoying a new  black gold rush thanks to the method of extracting oil and natural gas from shale rock using a chemical and water mix. Last week, a US government report announced that geologists believe the Monterey Shale, a geological formation covering 1,750 square miles south of San Francisco, could hold more than 15 billion barrels of oil. Fracking booms in Texas, Wyoming, Montana and Ohio mean US oil production exceeds seven million barrels a day for the first time in 20 years. Our reporter Caroline Graham in Stanley, North Dakota, another town that has seen a fracking boom . America is on track to be energy independent in five years and become ‘Saudi America’ – potentially overtaking Saudi Arabia as the world’s biggest oil producer within a decade. North Dakota, which lies above the Bakken formation – 200,000 square miles containing vast oil deposits only recently accessible thanks to fracking – has been dubbed ‘Kuwait on the prairie’ by locals still pinching themselves at their good fortune. Twelve new millionaires are being created each week thanks to companies leasing mineral rights beneath land often held by farming families for generations. The towns of Williston (pop 14,716) and Stanley (pop 4,000),  75 miles away, are at the epicentre of the Bakken boom. Plunging temperatures and heavy snow failed to dampen the sense of excitement in the air in Stanley last week. I watched as truck after truck thundered by on Highway 2. In one direction they head to the oil fields loaded with water, chemicals, sand and supplies. In the other, giant tankers return filled with crude. Fracking started here five years ago but it has only been in the past 18 months that locals say it has ‘gone mad’. Fracking in North Dakota has injected millions of ponds into the local economy as oil companies lease mineral rights owned by local farmers . Arden, 68, takes me for a drive  in his new truck. He recently purchased a horse farm in Phoenix (‘where me and the wife plan to spend the winter’), went on an Alaskan cruise, has invested in an apartment block and, two weeks ago, bought his first racehorse. ‘Nodding donkey’ oil rigs stretch as far as the eye can see over flat prairies covered in snow. Locals are not worried about environmental concerns which have dominated the fracking debate in the UK. Oil deposits here are 20,000-30,000ft down. The water supply is at 1,000ft. Arden says: ‘We love this land more than anyone. The oil companies work with us, they clean the fracking water before they take it away and there are safety inspectors crawling all over the rigs. ‘We have zero unemployment, the economy is booming and we are playing a massive part in making America energy independent. You won’t hear any moaning around here – well, maybe from those folk who don’t own mineral rights.’ Arden refuses to say how much he has earned but admits to being  a multi-millionaire. A typical well can earn $50,000 to $100,000 a month in royalties – about £33,000 to £66,000. State tax records for 2012 show 650 households in Stanley declared ‘new income’ over a million dollars. All Arden’s friends are millionaires several times over – one rancher receiving an eye-popping $1 million cheque last month. ‘He owns a massive amount of land,’ says Arden. ‘But that was a record even around here. The problem now is investing the money. It’s like winning the lottery every month. ‘And as they drill more wells, my cheques get bigger. I’m buying property and setting up trusts for my kids and grandkids.’ There are currently 9,000 oil-producing wells across North Dakota, with 2,300 more coming on stream this year. Experts say the Bakken rigs should produce oil for the next 50 years, and Stanley’s population is expected to double over the next 18 months. The Fire Spot bar is buzzing at 3pm on Friday. Tim Staude, 45, tells me he works five 14-hour days followed by five days off, and  earned $100,000 last year. ‘The company gives me free accommodation. It’s tough work and there are no women but the money’s good. There’s nothing else to do except drink. But I’m not complaining. I’m working hard, making money and helping my country. It’s the American dream.’","Williston, North Dakota, is one of the fracking capitals of the U.S.

However, Facebook’s Poke has rapidly . fallen down app popularity charts, despite a major PR effort, which revealed that founder Mark Zuckerberg had written . code for the app himself and that it has been created in just days by a small team of engineers. Snapchat, however, has retained its spot near the top of the charts for the Android and iOS versions of its app. Even news that easily available tools allowed iPhone users to save Snapchat videos, has failed to dent the rise of the app. Snapchat has risen to notoriety over the past year with many commentators accusing the service of promoting irresponsible sexual behaviour among teenagers. Launched in September 2011, it was reportedly inspired by the the humiliation of New York politician Anthony Weiner, who was caught sending explicit pictures of himself to a woman online. However, Mr Spiegel has denied that his social media tool could promote sexting among youngsters. 'I’m not convinced that the whole sexting thing is as big as the media makes it out to be,' he said. 'I just don’t know people who do that. It doesn’t seem that fun when you can have real sex.' Nevertheless, he has told BuzzFeed that the Snapchat team is 'trying to do a better job educating our users and their parents,' and that he was looking to add more guidance materials to their website.","Snapchat set up by two Stanford students, despite classmates' reservations .

"Getting out of bed to draw the curtains may soon be a thing of the past after scientists developed revolutionary technology that changes the transparency of windows. The Wi-Fi-enabled window shade, designed by Californian start-up SONTE, can be stuck to any glass including windows, showers and mirrors and can be controlled wirelessly using a smartphone. The energy-saving film also provides UV protection, can save money on heating bills by controlling the amount of heat that enters your home, and doubles up as a video projector screen. Scroll down for video . The SONTE film is less than half a millimetre thick and can be stuck to any glass covering using an adhesive strip on the back. An electricity conducting clip is fixed to the film which is then plugged into your home's electrics. When an electric current is applied, the blind goes see-through and when it is cut off it goes opaque . SONTE film uses smart glass technology, also  called smart windows or switchable windows. It has rod-like particles suspended in liquid placed between two plastic layers. When there is no electric current applied to the film, the suspended particles are arranged randomly and absorb light. This makes the glass panel look dark, or opaque. When a voltage is applied, the suspended particles join up and let light pass through. SPDs can be manually or automatically 'tuned' to let users control the amount of light, glare and heat that comes through. It can help control heating bills and reduce carbon emissions. SONTE film is the first ever 'Wi-Fi-enabled digital shade' that instantly switches from opaque to clear in one second. It is sold in one-by-one metre strips with an installation kit, including conducting clips that fit to the top of the film, and an electric cable. When an electric current is passed through the particles in the blind it makes it see-through. When the current is turned off, the film becomes opaque. The film uses smart glass technology. It has rod-like particles suspended in liquid placed between two plastic layers. The level of opacity on the SONTE film can be customised and the film is made of plastic that can be cut to size. The film contains particles that line up when an electric current is put through it. This makes the film look dark. When the electricity is cut off the particles disperse randomly and they let in the light . Power – 110-220VAC . Frequency – 50/60Hz . Current – 0.05 amperes per m2 . Power – less than 5 watts per m2 (power is consumed only in the (on) transparent state) Thickness – 0.4mm . Viewing angle – more than 140 degrees . Light transmittance – On (70%) Off (5%) Haze Coefficient – On (7%) Off (87%) UV – absorbs +85% . Infrared – reflects +70% . When there is no electric current applied to the film, the suspended particles are arranged randomly and absorb light. This makes the glass panel look dark, or opaque. When a voltage is applied, the suspended particles join up and let light pass through. The film can be manually or automatically 'tuned' to let users control the amount of light, glare and heat that comes through. It can help control heating bills and reduce carbon emissions. The film is less than half a millimetre thick. It only uses electricity when in the 'on' state and uses less than 5 watts per metre squared. It absorbs more than 85 per cent of UV rays and reflects over 70 per cent of infrared rays. The basic package costs £160 ($250). For £180 ($280) the package additionally comes with a Wi-Fi-enabled transformer that connects to your home network. When connected to the transformer, the film can be controlled using a free smartphone app. Once the film is cut to size and stuck onto a glass covering (left) electronic clips are applied that can be plugged into a Wi-Fi-enabled transformer and can be connected to your home network. Once connected, the blind can be made see-through or opaque using the smartphone app (right) The 'on' button makes the film see-through and the 'off' button turns the film opaque. The level of opacity can also be customised depending on the level of privacy you want and the film can also be cut to shape to fit skylights or other smaller glass coverings. The firm has now launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise more money to produce and ship the film. SONTE has until 3 July to raise the target of £128,000 ($200,000). The SONTE film can be cut to fit any glass covering including showers and bathroom windows. A one-by-one metre film with installation kit and Wi-Fi enabled transformer costs £179 ($280) VIDEO: Everything you want to know about SONTE film .","SONTE film can be stuck to windows or shower doors and can be made opaque or clear at the touch of a button .
