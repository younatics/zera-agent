"Chris Jordan, released by Surrey less than two years ago, returned to his old stamping ground on Thursday night to demonstrate that he has fought back to become one of England’s most exciting young talents. A new era desperately needs new stars and Jordan chose the perfect stage of The Kia Oval to show he is at the forefront of those who will be seeking to inspire England after the depths of their winter nightmare in Australia. Here Jordan, who first came to England from his native Barbados on a scholarship with Dulwich College, thrived with both bat and ball to sentence Sri Lanka to only their second defeat in 21 completed games in all formats. Star of the show: Chris Jordan celebrates taking the wicket of Nuwan Kulasekara . Having a blast: Sussex man Jordan had earlier smashed 38 runs from 13 balls . The fact that both of those losses came against England will encourage Alastair Cook at the start of a pivotal summer when he has been backed to build a new side alongside the returning coach Peter Moores. For now England will be happy that they have got off to a winning start in this Royal London series against a gifted one-day team who have contested five of the last seven finals in global limited-overs tournaments. It may be a new era but England are determined to stick to tried and tested methods in one-day cricket, backing their best batsmen to adapt rather than trying to inject dynamism in the form of Alex Hales into the top order. Their policy worked, with Ian Bell looking much more suited to the longer limited-overs format than he did when making his Twenty20 comeback here in the defeat by Sri Lanka on Tuesday. Firmly on the front foot: Gary Ballance hit five fours and a six during his swashbuckling 64 . Bell looked in great nick as he reached 50 off 56 balls, with one glorious straight six, but he let himself down with a dopey dismissal with storm clouds gathering over South London about to halt England’s momentum. Wickets can significantly effect targets under the Duckworth-Lewis method so Bell gave Sri Lanka quite a break when he steered Angelo Mathews to Lasith Malinga just before the heavens opened to register their disapproval at his folly. It could have proved a key moment in this first of five one-day internationals but, once the Oval had been mopped up, England rallied with highly promising contributions from the Yorkshire pair of Gary Ballance and Joe Root and a quite brilliant late assault. Jordan, now 25 and who rebuilt his career at Sussex last year, has proved himself quite a hitter in his short England career, most notably when he hit four sixes in the final over of a Twenty20 international in Bridgetown and then when he struck the only ball he received over the boundary against Scotland. Debut to remember: Harry Gurney took two wickets - including that of the great Kumar Sangakkara . Now he showed the ability which will encourage England to believe they have unearthed a genuine all-rounder when he smashed 38 off just 13 balls, 93 runs coming off the last seven overs as Jos Buttler joined in with 26 off 20. Together they lifted England to 247 for six off 39 overs with only the mystery spin of Sachithra Senanayake, who took three wickets, causing them any distress. Malinga has longed proved imperious at the end of an innings, but he had never suffered like this against England before, his eight wicketless overs costing more runs, 71, than in 19 previous one-day internationals. Handy contribution: Joe Root chipped in with some vital runs in the middle order . Even though Sri Lanka should have had the edge batting second when their target was reduced to 226 off 32 overs they were never in the hunt, with Jordan taking three wickets of his own as they fell 81 short of their adjusted aim. The icing on the England cake was a superb running catch from Cook, who hailed a ‘really important win’ afterwards, to dismiss Mathews which was raucously received by an Oval crowd who backed up the captain’s assertion that the public are still behind his side. They certainly will be if England keep on winning like this. Man of the match: Jordan looks to have cemented his place in England's ODI side .","England take 1-0 lead in five-match one-day international series .

"It was difficult to know what must have been more difficult for Caroline Wozniacki, stepping back out onto the court or facing the inevitable-if-polite probes about how she was feeling after her split with Rory McIlroy. The Dane tackled both with dignity but the most traumatic week in her life - which reports say involved being dumped in a three-minute phone conversation - had not got a whole lot better as she lost in the French Open first round and perhaps the only consolation was that she can get her life back together away from the spotlight. Choosing her words carefully about  her personal situation, she dispelled any suggestions that the break-up was ‘mutual’. 'Obviously you’re not prepared for something like this, and it came as a bit of a shock,' she said. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rory McIlroy talk about the pair's split . True colours: Caroline Wozniacki wore white, orange and green, the colours of the Irish flag in her French Open defeat to Yanina Wickmayer . Dumped: The defeat to the 64th-ranked Belgian was another blow for Wozniacki who split from her fiancee, Irish golfer McIlroy, last week . Disappointed: Wozniacki is left to rue a missed opportunity after losing 2-1 to Wickmayer at Roland Garros . Contrasting fortunes: Wozniacki's loss comes days after McIlroy dusted himself down and won the PGA Championship at Wentworth . That may . be putting it mildly, as she is said to have been unaware of any hints . that McIlroy’s bombshell was about to land, an upheaval that he . responded to so contrastingly on the golf course at Wentworth. It . did not help that she faced a rejuvenated opponent in Belgium’s Yanina . Wickmayer, who defeated her 7-6, 4-6, 6-2. Something to do with that was . that Wozniacki has also had to contend with a knee injury recently on . top of everything else. Following . the match, looking pale, drawn and possibly a little thinner, she took . some questions, although asked that they be related purely to the match . she just played. That was being somewhat optimistic but she held her . head high throughout. In . fact her exit attracted at least as much attention as what was a far . bigger upset in the women’s draw – the defeat of second seed and former . champion Li Na by French 21 year-old Kristina Mladenovic. Coinciding . broadly with the advent of her high profile relationship with the . Northern Irish golfer, Wozniacki’s star purely as a tennis player has . fallen somewhat, and as number 13 seed her loss was not of the seismic . variety by comparison. So long: Wozniacki waves goodbye after losing the first round match of the French Open . Not going to plan: Wozniacki sits on her chair as she ponders her performance . 'I . just tried to prepare the best that I could. It doesn’t make it easier . that I haven’t been able to play many matches because I have been . injured. I felt a bit rusty out there, it wasn’t really a pretty match . but I tried.' She . added that there was never a question that she would withdraw: 'I . always wanted to play here, you need to keep moving forward. This is . what I do and is my profession.' A . large Belgian contingent in the crowd were pulling for their player but . respectful enough: 'The crowd was great, I definitely can’t blame . anyone but myself out there today,' she said. 'I . would rather have been her longer but it’s not to be. I guess what’ s . supposed to happen will happen. So I’m just going to get myself together . and prepare for the grass. Wimbledon is a better surface for me.' Her eyes only reddened up when talking about the support she had from her family, especially her father Piotr. She's done it: Wickmayer celebrates beating former world No 1 Wozniacki in the first round of the French Open . Down and out: Wozniacki crashed out of the French Open at the first round stage for the first time since 2007 . 'He . means everything to me. Your family will always be there for you no . matter what happens. You know you can always talk, always fall back on . them, always figure out a way with them to make things better off the . court. That is always something I have needed and something that has . made me the player and person that I am today.' Last week, McIlroy announced he and Wozniacki mutually decided to split only days after sending out wedding invitations. The two time major winner and Wozniacki confirmed the relationship had ended after he realised he was not ready for marriage. The . golden couple of sport enjoyed a short-lived engagement after . announcing to their million plus Twitter followers last new year's eve . that they were to marry. At the time the pair posted matching pictures of themselves with a ring. It . is understood the couple - dubbed Wozzilroy in some circles after a . golf wedge was engraved with the moniker - had been an item for more . than two years. They were forced to scotch rumours of a split late last year. As . recently as last Sunday, McIlroy's Twitter feed suggested there were no . signs of trouble in the relationship after he posted a picture from . Nobu restaurant in Monte Carlo where the pair had dinner. McIlroy and Wozniacki spotted on May 15, shortly before their breakup was announced . Happier times: Wozniacki and McIlroy had been a couple since 2011 and sent out wedding invitations days before their split . On . Sunday, McIlroy won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. It was the . first triumph on European soil for the 25-year-old and followed a . fabulous final-round 66 that saw him overcome a seven-shot final-day . deficit to Thomas Bjorn. But . while things seem to be going well for the Northern Irishman, the same . cannot be said for Wozniacki following this defeat from the second Grand . Slam of the season. And . in an unfortunate coincidence, Wozniacki was wearing a white, orange . and green outfit, the colours of the Irish flag for her match at Roland . Garros. The adidas colours were chosen a couple of weeks ago, before the . couple announced their split. McIlroy . is Northern Irish, having been born in Holywood near Belfast, but has . previously represented Ireland in golf's World Cup. He must soon decide whether to represent Ireland or Great Britain at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Wozniacki . is next due to play at Eastbourne in the week before Wimbledon, . although she sounded uncertain, saying Eastbourne ‘was’ her planned next . event. Hopefully there is much that will be sorted in her head between . now and then. Li Na went down 7-5 3-6 6-1 to Mladenovic, removing one of the few players who is a threat to Serena Williams.","Caroline Wozniacki exits French Open in first round for first time since 2007 .

"Umar Mughal, 27, is currently on trial at the Old Bailey accused of fraud by abuse of position . A NatWest bank manager gave £830,000 to a fraudster posing as a 91-year-old customer 'because he wanted to eat his fish and chips', a court heard. Umar Mughal, 27, approved the bogus transfer of the funds at the Brentwood branch in Essex where he worked. He allegedly failed to carry out any checks to confirm the identity of the man who came into the branch on May 9 2012 claiming to be a wealthy client. Mr Mughal put his error down to the 'negative atmosphere' in the bank, while also claiming that he was trying to have his lunch at the time of the incident. Financial investigator Julia Payne told the Old Bailey that when the bank's system was examined there was no sign that Mr Mughal had confirmed the customer's signature. She continued: 'From a banking perspective people working in the branches know we could be targeted by a fraudster and to look at documentation to see if it is genuine.' Ms Payne added: 'The computer trail tells us what enquiries have been made in the account. 'As soon as Mr Mughal sat down he entered the sort code and account number. 'I would have expected to see a signature enquiry as that's how Mr Mughal told me he identified the customer. 'But the first thing after that is the funds transfer.' She said: 'There is no looking into the account for signatory or anything of the kind.' Prosecutor Fer Chinner said: 'The man comes into the branch and the transfers are made by Mr Mughal. 'Mughal logs on to the computer system at 14.07 and logs off at 14.34.' She said that Mr Mughal accessed five different accounts during the session and transferred the money into one account. Jurors heard £70,000 was taken from the first account, £10,325 from the second, £73,300 from the third, £23,100 from the forth and £76,600 from the final account. Mr Mughal was manager at the Natwest Branch in Brentwood, Essex, (above) when he says he accidentally approved fraudulent transfers worth £830,000 . The suspicious activity was spotted by the customer's private banking manager the following day who raised the alarm, it is said. Ms Payne said: 'The customer had a private banking manager, customers with large balances as he had would have a banking manager. He has blamed his grievous mistake on the 'negative atmosphere' in the bank, claiming his colleagues had been 'moaning all day' 'He noticed the large number of transfers the next day.' She added: 'He first contacted the branch and spoke to Mr Mughal to find out what had happened. 'Mr Mughal explained that the customer had come in.' Mr Mughal was investigated by the bank and claimed during an interview on May 10 2012 that he had 'made a mistake', the court heard. He allegedly tried to blame his colleagues for 'moaning all day' and creating a 'negative atmosphere'. During questioning, he said: 'I've done one stupid little thing which for me was a stupid thing but for the bank was massive. 'I never make the same mistake twice and unfortunately this mistake was big.' He added: 'When it comes to this transaction do I want to put it on here that I gave £800,000 to someone else because I wanted to eat my fish and chips?' Ms Payne asked him: 'Is that why?' Mr Mughal replied that he wanted to take his break and 'ignored' the procedure for customer identification. He added: 'I just wish I could turn back time and do my job again like I normally do.' Mr Mughal, of Walthamstow, east London, denies fraud by abuse of position. The trial continues.

"Miami heat player LeBron James announced in July that he's going back to Ohio to play for the Cleveland Cavaliers. He'll be selling his opulent Florida mansion in the process. LeBron James will no longer be living in South Florida so he's putting his Coconut Grove mansion back on the market for the hefty amount of $17 million. He'll be migrating back to his home near Akron in Ohio that measures up to 35,440 square-feet and only cost him $2.1 million when he bought it in 2003. The luxurious Florida mansion for sale is 12,178 square feet and has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, an infinity pool, and docks that can host two 60-foot yachts, writes The Bleacher Report.

The listing agent knows the needs of pro-athletes when buying a home or at home since coincidentally she is engaged to ex Miami Heat player Mark Strickland. As for LeBron's move, the player has said that he has a relationship with his hometown of Ohio that he cannot forget and he wants to go back and bring them the title he believes they deserve. Four years ago when LeBron left Ohio he was viciously criticized by his peers and by fans. Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert called LeBron a coward, a narcissist, and a quitter when he decided to make the move. Now the tables have turned and LeBron wants to payback his Ohio team for all the inspiration that they gave him. 'Before anyone ever cared where I would play basketball, I was a kid from Northeast Ohio. It's where I walked,' James told Sports Illustrated. 'It's where I ran. It's where I cried. It's where I bled. It holds a special place in my heart. People there have seen me grow up. I sometimes feel like I'm their son. Their passion can be overwhelming. But it drives me.' He's been quoted as saying that he originally went to Florida to win championships but now he believes he can take Cleveland up the ranks with him. 'My goal is still to win as many titles as possible, no question. But what's most important for me is bringing one trophy back to Northeast Ohio,' he told Sports Illustrated. LeBron may be going home, but he isn't taking the $17 million mansion with him. Instead he'll be living in a similarly plush home in The Bath Township right outside of Akron in Ohio.

"Ed Miliband's policy to pump more money into the NHS would not produce the £2.5billion until 2017/18 . Labour's key pledge to spend an extra £2.5billion a year on the NHS was in tatters last night, after it emerged that the money would not start trickling into NHS coffers until the middle of the next Parliament. Ed Miliband used his main conference speech two weeks ago to announce a mansion tax, the proceeds of which would go towards the Health Service. The £2.5billion Time to Care Fund would be paid for by a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and a tax avoidance crackdown – all of which would need legislation before the money could be spent. The Labour leader said his plan would help transform the NHS. Mr Miliband did not, however, mention that the policy would take time to phase in and would not produce the £2.5billion until 2017/18, depriving the Health Service of the money in the meantime. Sources close to shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the Guardian that none of the money would be available in the first year and only an unspecified amount would be available in the second year, because the party would need to steer a budget through Parliament before the taxes could be spent on the NHS. Last night, Conservative and Lib Dem MPs accused Labour of deceit and ‘hypocritical posturing’ over an issue Ed Miliband hopes will help win the General Election in May. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The centrepiece of Labour’s conference now lies in tatters. We have consistently said that the measures Ed Miliband set out wouldn’t raise anything like what he promised. ‘And now it’s clear that even the Shadow Chancellor agrees. NHS patients and staff deserve better than dishonesty and hypocritical posturing.’ Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said: ‘They have been found out. This turns out to be an attempt to deceive people. The policy is less than a fortnight old and it has completely unravelled. How did they think that they could get away with it? Health Secretary jeremy Hunt said centrepiece of Labour’s conference now lies in tatters . ‘Labour claims to be the party of the NHS, but you can’t protect the NHS if you can’t manage the economy. ‘Labour haven’t come clean about their NHS funding figures and now the true story is appearing.’ The Conservatives have pledged to continue giving the NHS real-term increases throughout the five years of the next Parliament. The Liberal Democrats plan to do the same, and to give it a further £1billion a year from 2016. A Labour spokesman said: ‘Our aim is to build up the £2.5billion-a-year fund as quickly as we can in the next Parliament.’ But Professor Chris Ham, chief executive of the King’s Fund health think-tank, called on Labour to clarify its plans. ‘NHS leaders need certainty to manage budgets and plan services for patients,’ he said, adding: ‘Having raised expectations, Labour needs to make clear exactly how much, and when, additional funding will be provided to relieve the unprecedented pressures on NHS budgets.’","Time to Care Fund would be paid for by mansion tax and tobacco firm levy .

"An A-grade student and school lacrosse star has been shot dead in a random drive-by shooting as she walked with friends to a sleepover to celebrate her 15th birthday. Molly Conley was walking along a narrow road in a residential area of Lake Stevens, Washington on Saturday night when gunfire broke out and she was fatally hit in the neck. Police received several calls at 11.18pm and officers rushed to the scene, where they found Molly unresponsive. None of her friends were injured. Molly, who turned 15 on Friday, had planned to spend the night at a friend's house before her birthday party on Sunday. Instead, her friends attended a vigil for Molly on Sunday at a local church. Loss: Molly Conley, pictured with her big brother, was gunned down as she celebrated her 15th birthday with friends on June 1 . Michel Hazen, who lives around the corner from the street, told KIRO: 'Just as I was kind of drifting off to sleep, I heard a loud, maybe a yell or a scream or something.... Then I started hearing sirens.' Police have not identified any suspects, and no arrests have been made. They said they are looking for a black SUV that was seen in the area. Authorities are also looking into numerous . other reports of possible drive-by shootings in the area, although it is . not yet known if they are connected to Molly's slaying. Molly was a freshman student at Blanchet High School in Seattle, where she had achieved the nickname '4.0' for her perfect grades. Star student: Molly had a 4.0 GPA and was a member of the lacrosse team at Blanchet High School . Loved: Teachers, relatives and friends described Molly as an upbeat, outstanding student . Tayloni Mazyck, 11, is another innocent young girl who fell victim to a stray bullet. She was walking outside her home in Brooklyn, New York on Friday night as 17-year-old Kane Cooper opened fire at two men in order to settle an argument around 8:30pm, DNAInfo reported. Tayloni was shot in the neck. The bullet ricocheted down her spine before becoming lodged at its base. She is unable to move her legs. Cooper is charged with attempted murder, assault, criminal use of a firearm and reckless endangerment. Friends and relatives remembered her as an accomplished student and actress and a talented lacrosse player who brightened up their days with her positive, caring attitude. Conley even persuaded her mother and stepfather to be foster parents to babies waiting for permanent homes. 'Molly would help take care of them, and she was extremely passionate,' her mother Susan Arksey told the Seattle Times. The president of the school, Tony . Desapio, said he is devastated by the killing and is offering support and counseling to . students. More than 800 friends and fellow students . gathered at Our Lady of Fatima Parish in Magnolia - where Molly . attended church - on Sunday night to pray for Conley and her family. Parents and children filled the sanctuary to honor Molly. Many students came wearing Blanchet's school colors, green and gold. Scene: The girls were walking to a lake before their sleepover when there were gunshots on this road . 'It was a deep moment of sharing grief, . and longing and missing Molly and a deep moment of trying to make sense . of a real tragedy,' Desapio said. 'Molly was a vibrant, wonderful . presences in our community. She was a blessing to us.' Friends also expressed their sadness . and condolences on Facebook. One of her closest friends, Iris Thatcher, . uploaded pictures of the girls as she paid tribute. 'Thank . you Molly for some of the best years I had ever had,' she wrote. 'I . love you so much and this is so hard to go through knowing one of my . best friends is gone. 'Thanks for being the best and impacting my life so greatly. RIP.' Heartbreak: Members of the lacrosse club grieve outside church after a vigil for Molly . Sadness: Two girls walk in to the Our Lady of Fatima church just hours after their friend was gunned down . Conley leaves behind a sister, who is a senior at the school, and a brother, who is in 10th grade. Lake Stevens, the area where the shooting took place, has suffered several other shootings in recent weeks. There are bullet holes in signs near to where Molly was killed. It is a suburban community with around 28,000 residents and largely made up with families. It surrounds a large lake around which many businesses and recreational activities center. Snohomish County sheriff's Lt. Rodney Rochon confirmed that the major crimes team is assisting Lake Stevens police with the investigation, but as of Sunday, they had no further information about the crime.","Molly Conley shot in the neck as she walked with friends on Saturday .

"Japanese officials today said they are . ready to provide an anti-flu drug as a potential treatment to fight the . rapidly expanding ebola outbreak. Chief . cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan may respond to emergency . individual requests for the favipiravir tablet, before any official . decision by the World Health Organisation. The . drug, developed by a subsidiary of Fujifilm Holdings to treat novel and . re-emerging influenza viruses, was approved by the Japanese health . ministry in March. It is available at any time, at the request of WHO, officials said today. Male nurse William Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone . A Japanese firm, a subsidiary of Fujifilm Holdings, said it has 20,000 doses of the flu drug favipiravir available to treat ebola victims, after the drug proved effective treating mice infected with the deadly virus, pictured . It . comes as a the first British victim of the outbreak, nurse William . Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London after contracting the deadly . virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone. Despite . the grave dangers, he had selflessly volunteered to serve in a . makeshift clinic where other nurses had died from ebola or were too . scared to come into work. Mr Pooley last night arrived back to London in an isolation sack for treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. Last night the NHS started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus. ZMapp, . an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients, has shown . promising results, apparently aiding the recovery of two U.S. missionaries who contracted the virus. But Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the American company behind it, says stocks are exhausted. A . source at the Department of Health said: 'We are working with our . international partners to source remaining doses for the patient.' The WHO said earlier this month that it is ethical to use untested drugs on ebola patients given the magnitude of the outbreak. Fujifilm . spokesman Takao Aoki said ebola and influenza viruses are the same type . and theoretically similar effects can be expected on Ebola. The British man infected with the Ebola virus is loaded into an Royal Air Force ambulance after being flown home on a C17 plane from Sierra Leone, at Northolt air base outside London . He said the drug has also proved effective in lab experiments on mice. Fujifilm said it has favipiravir stock for more than 20,000 patients. The company is also in talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on clinical testing of the drug in treating Ebola. Favipiravir is one of only a few drugs that may work on ebola. Several drugs are . being developed for ebola treatment. But they are still in early stages . and there is no proven treatment or vaccine for the highly fatal . disease, and Fujifilm's drug is one of only a few new drugs that may . work on ebola. Favipiravir . inhibits viral gene replication within infected cells to prevent . propagation, while conventional ones are designed to inhibit the release . of new viral particles to prevent the spread of infection, the company . said. Recently, two . Americans, Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol, have been treated with another experimental drug called ZMapp, . developed by San Diego Mapp Biopharmaceutical. The drug had never been tested on humans, although an early version had been found to work in some ebola-infected monkeys. It is aimed at boosting the immune system's efforts to fight the disease. Mr . Pooley is the only Briton to be have ever been infected by ebola . outside the laboratory. The only other British case was in 1976, when . scientist Geoffrey Platt pricked himself with a needle contaminated with . the virus. Health officials . last night said Mr Pooley was 'not seriously unwell' – a factor which . will significantly boost his chance of survival. Most patients die of . ebola because of dehydration, when their blood vessels break down and . their major organs fail. But . fit, young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly . improved chance of survival. If they are hydrated and the bleeding . controlled, their immune systems can in some cases kick in, and defeat . the virus. Pictures have emerged of the moment a British charity worker was evacuated back to the UK on board a Royal Air Force jet . The patient was flown into an airport near London, then driven across the capital . British charity worker, Mr Pooley, from Woodbridge in Suffolk, was diagnosed with ebola and airlifted out of Sierra Leone and taken to the High Security Infectious Disease Unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London (pictured) Experimental serum ZMapp was created from a combination of antibodies in January. Until the drug was given to the American Ebola sufferers, it had only been tested on monkeys. It is unclear exactly how it works but both Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol recovered from Ebola after receiving the serum. It is only available in limited supplies as larger scale human testing is needed to prove it safe and effective. The companies behind the drug, ZMapp and Kentucky BioProcessing are currently working to have the product approved and the production accelerated. The companies said in a statement: 'It is important to note that the emergency use of an experimental medicine is a highly unusual situation. 'As a consequence global high-level discussions concerning the policy, ethical, and medical implications of this exceptional situation have been initiated.' The WHO has put the number of people infected with the deadly ebola virus at 2,615. Some 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in Guinea in March, before spreading to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Rigorous . quarantine measures are used to stop the spread of ebola, as well as . high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with . sufferers. Symptoms of the virus appear as a sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This . is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver . function and, in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. The effects of the disease normally appear between two and 21 days after infection. It is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through person-to-person transmission. The . WHO said the disease can be passed between people by direct contact - . through broken skin or mucous membranes - with the blood, secretions, . organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and indirect contact . with environments contaminated with such fluids. Treatment: The hospital is the only centre in the UK equipped to treat ebola and prevent the disease from spreading . U.S. doctor Kent Brantly is pictured saying goodbye to the team that saved him at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia after he was successfully treated for ebola using the experimental drug Zmapp . Aid worker Nancy Writebol, pictured with her husband David, was also treated at the Atlanta hospital using Zmapp. Manufacturers of the drug say stocks of the drug are exhausted . The . Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued updated travel advice last . week which urged people to carefully assess their need to travel to . Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. 'General . medical facilities throughout Sierra Leone are currently under severe . strain due to the Ebola outbreak, and unable to provide the same . standard of healthcare as in the UK. 'Dedicated healthcare facilities for Ebola are overwhelmed,' the FCO warned. The . Sierra Leone parliament has voted to pass a new law which means anyone . caught hiding an Ebola patient can receive prison terms of up to two . years. Some 910 cases have . been recorded in the country - and 392 deaths - but the WHO believes the . magnitude of the outbreak has been underestimated because people are . hiding infected friends and family in their homes. The . WHO reported that corpses are being buried in rural villages without . notifying health officials and with no investigation of the cause of . death. In . some instances epidemiologists have travelled to villages and counted . the number of fresh graves as a rough estimate of suspected cases.","Japanese chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga revealed the drug favipiravir is available at any time to World Health Organisation .

"Paris St Germain have been called before UEFA's disciplinary commission over allegations of racism by their fans at last month's Champions League clash against Chelsea in Paris. The allegations concern 'racism, other discriminatory conduct and propaganda' during April 2's home leg of the quarter-final, according to the governing body. PSG won the match 3-1 but went on to lose the tie on away goals. A UEFA statement released to Press Association Sport read: 'Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against PSG on 16 May 2014 for alleged offences concerning ""racism, other discriminatory conduct and propaganda"" at their UEFA Champions League quarter-final played against Chelsea in Paris. Opener: Ezequiel Lavezzi scored PSG's first goal of the night in just the third minute . Dejected: Chelsea players following PSG taking a 2-1 lead following David Luiz's own goal . 'The UEFA control and disciplinary body will decide on the matter on 17 July 2014. 'We do not make any further comment until the official disciplinary decision is announced by end of July.' The match was preceded by clashes between rival supporters on the streets of Paris, with Chelsea fans reportedly chanting racist abuse and making Nazi salutes while a group of around 100 PSG ultras targeted travelling fans. A report on the website of Paris newspaper Le Parisien on Tuesday evening indicated that a group of disabled Chelsea fans had filed a complaint after objects including chewing gum and a bottle were thrown at them during the game at the Parc des Princes. Advantage: Javier Pastore scored late to put PSG 3-1 up after first leg in Paris . Last gasp: But Demba Ba netted the last-minute winner in the second leg that put Chelsea through . UEFA's disciplinary regulations specify a minimum sanction of a partial stadium closure for a club found guilty of a first offence of racist abuse by their supporters. Article 14 of the regulations also states: 'A second offence is punished with one match played behind closed doors and a fine of 50,000 euros. 'Any subsequent offence is punished with more than one match behind closed doors, a stadium closure, the forfeiting of a match, the deduction of points or disqualification from the competition. 'If the circumstances of the case require it, the competent disciplinary body may impose additional disciplinary measures on the member association or club responsible, such as the playing of one or more matches behind closed doors, a stadium closure, the forfeiting of a match, the deduction of points or disqualification from the competition.'

"Two Chelsea Pensioners collecting money for the British Legion Poppy Appeal were refused a short sit-down at a restaurant  because staff said they were too busy, it has been claimed. The men, who live at Royal Hospital Chelsea, were among celebrities and well-wishers fundraising in Covent Garden as part of Poppy Day London when they asked if they could rest for a few minutes.

But when they approached 21, one of the many al-fresco restaurant in Covent Garden, staff said they could not said down. The restaurant's owner, Trevor Davies, tonight apologised for the incident and described it as a 'misunderstanding'. 'I give my staff strict instructions not to let people take seats off site because what happens is people never see them again. 'A lot of people we have, their English isn't quite good enough so when the gentlemen were asking to sit down they thought they meant taking the seats away and that's why they said no.

"Craig Stewart, 31, admitted three charges of possessing a knife at the village hall in Llandderfel . A birthday party guest threatened another man with a knife – after he was accused of eating too much sage and onion stuffing. Craig Peter Stewart, 31, felt ‘insulted’ by a fellow guest as he helped himself to food from a buffet table at the village hall in Llandderfel in Gwynedd, Wales, a court heard. He walked the 200 yards to his home and changed into different clothes before picking up three knives – a 5inch kitchen knife, a 3inch paring knife and a large bread knife - and headed back to the party. Dolgellau magistrates heard that he ‘brandished the knife in a threatening manner’ and was ‘making threats with the knife’ towards the man he said had ‘insulted’ him. Magistrates were told the group of partygoers were left ‘absolutely terrified’. ‘All the witnesses say they believed the defendant was going to use the knife’ and were ‘scared for their safety,’ the court heard. Police were called to the hall just after 2am on August 24 and found Stewart being restrained by two of the revellers. When officers searched him they found two of the knives nearby and another tucked in the waistband of his trousers. In defence, the court heard that Stewart had returned to the party with the knives as he ‘wanted more food’ and there was ‘no cutlery on the buffet table’. The court also heard that he had decided to change his clothes because he was ‘freezing’. Prosecutors, however, labelled his version of events ‘fantastical’. While the court heard that Stewart is ‘distraught’ at his actions and that it was a ‘one-off incident’, new guidelines  mean that anyone convicted of a knife-related crime now faces a stiff penalty. Stewart, of Llandderfel, Gwynedd, pleaded guilty to three charges of possessing a knife when he appeared before magistrates on Thursday, October 16. He is due to be sentenced at Caernarfon Crown Court on Thursday November 6 after Dolgellau magistrates ruled that they were unable to impose a sufficiently tough sentence. He was released on conditional bail until the hearing.

"Months after it revealed it had concealed the sexual abuse of children by priests for decades, the Archdiocese of Chicago has released thousands of more files on about three dozen more abusive clergy members to fulfill Cardinal Francis George's pledge to make them public before he retires. The archdiocese first made public files on 30 abusive priests in January, and on Thursday it posted the additional files on 35 more on its website. Altogether, the 15,000 pages of documents outline how the archdiocese dealt with abuse allegations over the past six decades. The Archdiocese is expected to release files today detailing  dozens of more abusive priests in what diocese officials say is a fulfillment of George's vow to make public the documents before he retires this month. In this September 20, 2014 file photo, Cardinal Francis George, retiring leader of the Chicago Catholic Archdiocese speaks at a news conference in Chicago. 'Cardinal George wanted it finished on his watch,' said John O'Malley, special counsel to the archbishop for misconduct issues. O'Malley said George didn't want Bishop Blase Cupich to have to deal with the issue when he assumes leadership of the nation's third largest archdiocese later this month. A report provided by the archdiocese to  media this week suggests the documents are similar to those made public in January that described how the archdiocese hid the histories of abusive priests moving between parishes, did not swiftly remove the men from the priesthood, and in some cases helped them remain priests for years after allegations against them were deemed credible. The files cover more than 350 incidents of abuse since 1952. The vast majority of the reported incidents happened when the late Cardinals John Cody and Joseph Bernardin headed the archdiocese. George took the helm in 1997. Not included among the documents are allegations against former priest Daniel McCormack, whose case could have shed light on how George handled suspected abuse. McCormack pleaded guilty in 2007 to abusing five children and his case prompted an internal investigation of how the archdiocese responds to abuse claims and an apology from George. But O'Malley said the archdiocese is prohibited by law from releasing McCormack's file because there remains pending civil litigation.","The Archdiocese revealed in January that they had covered up abuse allegations against 30 priests for decades .

"John Moore-Robinson, who died just 24 hours after being discharged from the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital in April 2006 . The father of a 20-year-old cyclist who bled to death after being misdiagnosed with bruised ribs when he actually had a ruptured spleen has said he will never forgive the hospital for the grave mistake. John Moore-Robinson was discharged from scandal-hit Stafford Hospital despite being unable to walk, and later died after suffering a heart attack in his home. After an eight-year battle for justice by Mr Moore-Robinson's family, a coroner ruled today that the young man's death could have been prevented if hospital staff had provided 'appropriate' care. Mr Moore-Robinson, from Sileby, Leicestershire, collapsed and died in April 2006 within hours of being sent home in a wheelchair with an undiagnosed ruptured spleen . A second inquest into his death was told that staff at Stafford Hospital were told that the 20-year-old's condition was potentially life-threatening. But the telecoms engineer, who had been hurt in a cycling accident, was discharged later the same day after X-rays showed he had no broken bones, despite friends saying he was confused and vomiting. A string of serious failings in care 'more than minimally' contributed to Mr Moore-Robinson's death, Coroner Catherine Mason said. Mrs Mason, recording a narrative verdict, said: 'The seriousness of Mr Moore-Robinson's condition was not fully appreciated and decisions in relation to his care were made on incomplete information as a result of poor communication, poor documentation, inadequate assessment, insufficient investigation and an oversight to consider medical notes that were available. 'If Mr Moore-Robinson had been managed in accordance with his needs, the clinical grounds necessitating his admission to hospital would have been apparent. 'The opportunity to provide appropriate care to treat his ruptured spleen and prevent critical collapse of the venous system would not have been lost and on the balance of probabilities the loss of his life could have been prevented.' Mr Moore-Robinson, pictured with his grandmother, was left waiting for treatment at the A&E department for 70 minutes despite the ambulance crew saying his condition was 'life-threatening' Janet and Frank Robinson campaigned for a fresh hearing after new evidence came to light about the death of their son . Mrs Mason added that a 'continuous sequence of shortcomings' had created a chain of events leading to the cyclist being discharged early. Mr Moore-Robinson, whose friends had to use a wheelchair to take him to a waiting car, later called an ambulance himself from his home but suffered a heart attack shortly after paramedics arrived. Medics at Leicester Royal Infirmary attempted to revive him but he was pronounced dead at 2.35am on April 2, 2006. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Moore-Robinson's father, Frank, said: 'Stafford Hospital at the time was in melt-down. 'Many, many people have lost their lives, including our son John, and that we can never forgive them for. It's been a hard road but one we have had to take.' Kelly Hainsworth, Mr Moore-Robinson's sister, said: 'The last eight years have not been about publicity, headlines or notoriety - it has been about finding the truth. 'It has been a long eight years but we have had to walk this path together to get justice and to make the NHS a safer place for everybody. 'We are satisfied with the facts that have been laid before the coroner and accept the findings.' Relatives also thanked the coroner for her 'fearless' inquiry into the care provided at Stafford Hospital, which was the subject of a government inquiry in 2010. The 20-year-old telecoms engineer was discharged from Stafford Hospital because X-rays showed he had no broken bones, despite friends saying he was confused and vomiting . In 2009, it emerged that hundreds of patients could have died unnecessarily because of shocking levels of care in the Stafford Hospital's A&E department . An inquest held in 2007 into Mr Moore-Robinson's death also recorded a narrative verdict but Mr Moore-Robinson's parents campaigned for a fresh hearing after new evidence came to light. Concluding the second inquest, Mrs Mason found that Mr Moore-Robinson was not triaged properly, and that a nurse had failed to communicate 'obvious' and relevant information to a doctor. As a result of the failure, the patient was seen by a junior doctor more than an hour after his arrival at Stafford Hospital. Routine procedures were also carried out inadequately, the new inquest heard. A nurse told the hearing that staff at Stafford felt 'bullied' by a four-hour target for patients' length of stay in the accident and emergency department. Commenting on the situation at the hospital in 2006, Mrs Mason added: 'Although I was pleased to hear in evidence that the staffing levels have now much improved ... I find as of fact that on 1st April 2006 there was a failure to adequately staff the accident and emergency department which impacted on the adequacy of care.'","John Moore-Robinson was injured in a cycling accident in April 2006 .

"England eased past Qatar in their opening game of the Toulon Tournament but their match on Monday evening is at the opposite end of the scale. The Young Lions face the might of Brazil, a formidable challenge at any level of international football. Manager Gareth Southgate insists they are not in France to make up the numbers, and Sportsmail takes a look at who could be lining up for both sides. England (probable, 4-2-3-1) Jack Butland . Age 21, Goalkeeper, Stoke City (previously at Birmingham City, loan spells at Cheltenham Town, Barnsley, Leeds United), U20 Caps 4, U21 Caps 19, England caps 1. The high-rated keeper has been tipped as England’s future No 1 ever since he made his Birmingham debut in 2010 but, after a move to Stoke in 2013, has yet to establish himself in the full squad despite making a senior appearance against . That's mine! Jack Butland is set to keep goal for England Under 21s against Brazil on Monday night . Ben Gibson . Age 21, Right-Back, Middlesbrough (loan spells at Plymouth Argyle, York City, Tranmere Rovers), U20 Caps 1, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 0, U21 Goals 0. The nephew of Boro chairman Steve Gibson, Gibson is a versatile defender who can operate at centre-back or full-back. He was a key member of the 2010 UEFA European U17 Championship-winning side. Liam Moore . Age 21, Centre-Back, Leicester City (loan spells at Bradford City and Brentford), U20 Caps 1, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 4, U21 Goals 0. This has been a real breakthrough year for Moore as the commanding centre-back established himself in the Championship-winning Leicester side, making 30 appearances. Looks every bit a future full international. Michael Keane . Age 21, Centre-Back, Manchester United (loan spells at Leicester City, Derby County, Blackburn Rovers), U20 Caps 0, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 3, U21 Goals 3. Switched allegiance from the Republic of Ireland to England and the Manchester United product impressed on loan at Blackburn this season before Ryan Giggs placed him on the bench against Hull City in the last game of the season. Measured: Michael Keane has impressed both at centre-half and right-back in recent seasons . Luke Garbutt . Age 21, Left-Back, Everton (loan spells at Cheltenham Town, Colchester United), U20 Caps 3, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 1, U21 Goals 0. Part of the 2010 UEFA European U17 Championship winning side, the Everton left-back has only made two first team appearances for the club, with Leighton Baines keeping him out of the side. James Ward-Prowse (c) Age 19, Defensive Midfielder, Southampton, U20 Caps 5, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 7, U21 Goals 2. Yet another player to come from Southampton’s conveyor belt of youth talent, Ward-Prowse has already made 49 first team appearances and is a key member of the Saints’ side, as well as being Gareth Southgate’s trusted skipper. Captain Fantastic: Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse is expected to skipper the side . Nathaniel Chalobah . Age 19, Defensive Midfielder, Chelsea (loan spells at Watford, Nottingham Forest, Middlesbrough), U20 Caps 0, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 18, U21 Goals 1. An extremely versatile and hard-working midfielder, Chalobah has lots of energy and uses his size and athleticism to dominate midfield. A player very much in the Yaya Toure mould. Nathan Redmond . Age 20, Winger, Norwich City (previously at Birmingham City), U20 Caps 0, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 10, U21 Goals 5. Redmond seems to have been around for an age. He is lightning quick and extremely dangerous on the counter. Could be crucial to England’s success on Monday night. Josh McEachran . Age 21, Attacking Midfielder, Chelsea (loan spells at Swansea City, Middlesbrough, Watford, Wigan Athletic), U20 Caps 1, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 13, U21 Goals 1. He really has not lived up to the early hype at Chelsea, yet McEachran dictates the tempo of England’s play with his short, sharp passing. Tricky: Winger Nathan Redmond really impressed for Norwich City in the Premier League last season . Jordan Obita . Age 20, Winger, Reading (loan spells at Barnet, Gillingham, Portsmouth, Oldham Athletic), U20 Caps 1, U20 Goals 1, U21 Caps 0, U21 Goals 0. Scored a debut goal in the 3-0 win over Qatar to continue a fantastic year for the youngster after he was named Reading’s player of the season. Can operate at left-wing or left-back and is supposedly interesting Arsene Wenger. Saido Berahino . Age 20, Striker, West Bromwich Albion (loan spells at Northampton Town, Brentford, Peterborough United), U20 Caps 5, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 5, U21 Goals 6. The West Brom forward scored the winner at Old Trafford earlier in the season and, although not prolific, he is a good finisher and he will be tasked with scoring England’s goals on Monday night. Brazil (probable, 4-5-1) Marcos . Age 18, Goalkeeper, U17 Caps 5, U23 Caps 1, Fluminense (played in Toulon tournament twice) The Fluminese goalkeeper has yet to make a first-team appearance for his club side but is highly-rated within the Brazilian national set-up. Gilberto . Age 21, Right-Back, U20 Caps 2, Internacional (on loan from Botafogo) A tough-tackling right back who has enjoyed spells at Internacional and Botafogo. Will have to deal with the raw pace of Obita and Redmond on England’s flanks. Driving forward: Twenty-one-year-old Gilberto is strong in the tackle and helps Brazil in attack . Marquinhos . Age 20, Centre-Back, U20 Caps 14, Brazil Caps 1, Paris Saint-Germain . Already has a full international cap and is one of the hottest prospects in Europe – which is exactly why Paris Saint-Germain forked out a staggering £25.4m to sign him from Roma last summer, and why Barcelona are trying to prize him away from the French capital. Doria (c) Age 19, Centre-Back, U20 Caps 8, Brazil Caps 1, Botafogo . Brazil’s captain forms a commanding centre-back partnership with Marquinhos. Has been linked with Chelsea in the past and is considered to be the next Thiago Silva. Wendell . Age 20, Left-Back, U20 Caps 2, Bayer Leverkusen . Yet another Brazilian import into Europe, the left-back signed a five-year contract at Bayer Leverkusen in February. Has bags of energy and loves to get forward whenever he can. Rodrigo Caio . Age 20, Defensive Midfielder, U20 Caps 2, Sao Paulo . Normally a centre-back, Caio operates at defensive midfield for the national side. Has won plaudits for his discipline and his man-marking abilities. Hot property: Lucas Evangelista has had trials at Manchester United and a tricky customer in midfield . Lucas Evangelista . Age 19, Midfielder, U20 Caps 3, Sao Paulo . An attacking midfielder who had trials at Manchester United before opting to stay in his native Brazil, he is quick and extremely skilful on the ball. Will punish England if they give him time and space. Leandro . Age 21, Winger, U20 Caps 3, U23 Caps 1, Brazil Caps 1, Palmeiras . Leandro is used to leading from the front at Palmeiras, but has slotted into the midfield for Brazil in Toulon so far. The attacking winger even scored when Luiz Scolari handed him his full international debut in a friendly against Bolivia. Lucas Piazon . Age 20, Winger, U15 Caps 7, U17 Caps 15, U20 Caps 2, Chelsea . The attacking midfielder spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem from Chelsea, having made just one league appearance under Roberto Di Matteo in the 8-0 win over Aston Villa. The 20-year-old can play in various attacking roles, and is likely to sit behind Thalles. Familiar: Lucas Piazon - who was on loan at Vitesse in Holland - will be nothing new to Chelsea fans . Alisson . Age 20, Attacking Midfielder, U21 Caps 5, U20 Caps 3, U17 Caps 3, Cruzeiro (not to be confused with Alison) Alisson has the ability to create something from nothing, and Cruzeiro’s attacking midfielder should line up as partner to Piazon. The 20-year-old spent time on loan at Vasco da Gama in 2013 so knows striker Thalles well. Not to be confused with Brazil’s defensive midfielder Alison. Thalles . Age 19, Striker, U20 Caps 2, Vasco da Gama . Thalles can physically impose himself on his opponents, and is unlike the usual slick forwards Brazil are known for. He scored the first in the win over South Korea and should lead from the front again.","James Ward-Prowse expected to skipper the side .

"Jacqui Lambie has submitted a new draft law to parliament that would impose jail time and fines of up to $68,000 for adults who force children to wear a burqa in public. The Private Members bill, if introduced, would also see severe fines and prison sentences for forcing an adult to wear a full face covering, with a fine of $34,000 or six months in prison. Thirdly, the bill would make it illegal to wear the burqa in public unless the individual was wearing it for newly specified reasons. Scroll down for video . Jacquie Lambie delivering a speech at Parliament House in Canberra. Ms Lambie has proposed a new law that would impose fines of up to $68,000 for parents who force their children to wear a burqa in public . In the bill, the Palmer United Senator wrote: ‘For basic security reasons and the need for assimilation, identity-concealing garments should not be allowed in Australian public or Parliament house.’ She proposed that on the spot fines should be issued to members of the public who breach the laws. ‘Any person who is deemed by a police officer to have worn any identity concealing garments in public unlawfully, will be issued with an on the spot fine or charged with an offence which carries a maximum fine of $3,400,' she said. Ms Lambie added that the system would be ‘very simple and similar to way traffic infringements are handled by police'. She said the only exception for wearing  facial coverings was in private places of worship, for reasons of anonymity and on health or professional grounds.

"Arrested: Nicholas Rotundo, 23, allegedly duped a woman into emailing him nude photos of herself . A Google worker tricked a woman into sending him naked photos by claiming he was conducting a 'breast perception study' - and threatened to put the photos on a revenge porn website unless she sent more, court documents show. Nicholas Rotundo, 23, who works at Google's Mountain View, California headquarters, was arrested earlier this month for cyberstalking after a Texas student contacted cops. When investigators searched his computers, they found he had also duped two other women and taken images of them using their webcams, according to documents obtained by The Smoking Gun. Rotundo joined Google as an Internal Technology resident after graduating from the University of Texas at Dallas in May 2013 and allegedly began cyberstalking the woman a month later. He contacted the University of Texas at Dallas student, who had previously signed up to be part of studies for the college, saying he was looking for submissions for a breast perception study. The email was sent from breastperceptionstudy@gmail.com and listed its sender as 'Women Study'. It said researchers were looking into 'the public's perception of different breast types', TGS reported. The sender was asking for a 'full-body nude photograph' and other images of the woman’s breasts. Initially, the emails said researchers were offering participants $4,500 for taking part but, when the woman failed to respond, the sum was upped to $8,500 'because of the need to finish the study'. After learning of this new offer, she sent four naked photos of herself to the email address, and received an email thanking her and welcoming her to send any others she may wish, TGS reported. Five weeks later, she received an email from a new email address from a man who claimed to have come across her naked photos, adding: 'I would hate for anybody else to see.' Accused: After receiving the images from the woman, he allegedly sent her another email pretending he had come across the photographs and would leak them unless she sent more graphic ones . Workplace: Rotundo started work at Google's California headquarters, pictured, after he graduated in May 2013 and allegedly started cyberstalking the woman, who was in Texas, a month later . He also attached one of the images of the woman, and pointed out that she was wearing a necklace that would make her easily identifiable. The sender said that he would not leak the images as long as the woman sent a video - 'at least one minute long' - showing her masturbating, as well as other images of parts of her body. After the unidentified woman emailed photos of her breasts to someone she believed was conducting a study, she received this email on January 26, 2014: . 'Hi. Hope you're having a good Sunday! I've stumbled across some pictures of you. The type that I would hate for anybody else to see, and I can make sure that nobody else does. However, I'm gonna need you to help me to fill out the set.' He then demanded she sent him a variety of images and videos. 'Reply before midnight your time acknowledging that you received this and, at the very least, send a low res version of one of the above. I expect the rest by Wed, midnight. I've attached a picture [showing an image she had sent the 'researchers'] for reference. Wearing that necklace really hurt plausible deniability :) Again, if you sent all of this, I swear to it that no photo or video will surface and you will not be contacted again. Thanks :)' 'If you send all of this, I swear to it that no photo or video will surface and you will not be contacted again,' he allegedly wrote in the January 2014 email - adding a smiley face emoticon. Then last month, he warned the woman that she needed to send the photos otherwise 'you might find something you don't like' on Pink Meth, a revenge porn web site. He said that she should not contact authorities because he had covered his tracks, but she went to campus police, and investigators learned he had actually done little to hide his identity. Investigations showed that the email accounts were accessed from an IP address that had been subscribed to by 'Google Nick Rotundo'. He had also signed into the email account from a New York hotel that is opposite Google offices, and records showed Rotundo was in the city on that date, the Smoking Gun reported. When investigators showed the woman a picture of Rotundo, she said she recognized him, although it is not known what relationship they had. Searches also showed photos of two other women that he had allegedly taken through webcams without their knowledge, court documents said. Rotundo was arrested on October 4 and was indicted on two cyberstalking charges, which each carry a maximum penalty of five years behind bars. Another charge of computer intrusion carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison. He paid $4,500 bond and will next appear in court in December. He has also been prohibited from using the internet in that time.","Nicholas Rotundo contacted a University of Texas student saying he was conducting a study of 'the public's perception of different breast types'

"Police in Tennessee are on the lookout for  two robbery suspects who are accused of being involved in two very violent crimes. 23-year-old Jonas Bolden is suspected of breaking into two people's homes earlier this month. His girlfriend, Sarah Long, who is 19, helped him in the second robbery . Real life Bonnie & Clyde: County Sheriff's deputies are looking for 23-year-old Jonas Bolden and Sarah Long, 19, and say are armed and dangerous . Dangerous liaisons: Investigators said on Sunday, Bolden broke into a home and held a woman, who is bedridden, at knifepoint. His girlfriend was involved in a second robbery alongside him, a couple of days later . On Sunday, deputies said Bolden broke into a woman's home who was bed-ridden, held her up at knife point, assaulted her, cut her on the arm, stole her pocket book and then ran off. Two days later, Bolden, with the help of his girlfriend Long, busted into the home of a man he knew from Church, called Mr Bunch. Once again he again assaulted his victim,threatened him with a knife. When the homeowner refused to give the suspects the money, investigators said Long went into another room and took the victim's pistol. Toxic: Bolden and his girlfriend, Long, apparently broke into a home. When the homeowner refused to give the suspects the money, investigators said Long went into another room and took the victim's pistol . On the run: During the second robbery in which both were involved, deputies said the suspects beat up the victim. The homeowner suffered severe bruising and a broken collarbone . Lethal love: Deputies say Bolden and Long are likely to be armed and dangerous . Deputies said Bolden then held the victim at gunpoint using his own firearm and stole his money. During the robbery, deputies said the suspects beat up the victim. The homeowner suffered severe bruising and a broken collarbone and is still in shock from the incident. 'I've got two drawers on the night stand. He dug through all of those, dug my socks out,' said Mr Bunch. The man says he met Bolden through his church and was trying to help him out. He lent him money just days ealier and trusted him. Now he says he feels as though he has been invaded. Menacing: Jonas Stanley Bolden, 23, of Bean Station, is accused of two especially aggravated armed robberies by Hamblen County Sheriff's Office .

Callous disregard: Both Long and her boyfriend Bolden assaulted victims at knifepoint, as well as threatening and using violence against them as they robbed the two houses . Carrie McCann, with the Hamblen County Sheriff's Office, says the suspects chose their victims because they knew they were at home and vulnerable. 'It's kinda unusual, most criminals go to a location that's not occupied that they can get away from fairly quickly. These people don't seem to care, which makes them extremely dangerous,' said Ms. McCann to WVLT. Deputies said Bolden and Long are armed and dangerous. Betrayal: The victims met Bolden and his girlfriend through his church and were trying to help him out. One of the victims lent him money only days before .","Officials have searched for Jonas Stanley Bolden, 23, and Sarah Long, 19,  for several days .

"Alert: Gregory Lewis fled his $1,000 bail in September and is suspected of at least six more violent sexual assaults across the country since . A Massachusetts man who fled child rape charges and is suspected of carrying out at least six more sexual assaults on a coast-to-coast raping spree is believed to be returning home. Gregory Lewis, 16, fled his home town of Southbridge after he cut off his GPS tracking bracelet on September 15 and left it on the front lawn on his alleged 13-year-old female rape victim. Freed on only $1,000 bail, Lewis is believed to have traveled as far as the West Coast and was last spotted on surveillance footage in Columbus, Ohio. Law enforcement have declared him armed and extremely dangerous and told the public not to approach him. 'He is coming back east, and he is committing crimes as he goes,’ said David Procopio, a spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police to the Boston Globe. 'We have concerns that he could be coming back to Southbridge.’ A nationwide alert has been sent to all law enforcement authorities to apprehend Lewis, who in addition to grooming and raping the 13-year-old girl, is accused of luring 'multiple' escorts to his seedy motel rooms and beating and raping them. 'The victims have been handcuffed, threatened with a gun, robbed, and sexually assaulted,' says a report issued to all state police in an update. Spotted: Lewis is believed to have been spotted in Denver (left earlier in October and was last seen in Columbus, Ohio over the weekend (right) Trail of terro: A nationwide alert has been sent to all law enforcement authorities to apprehend Lewis . Search: The suspect is driving his stepfather's Jeep Cherokee, which was stolen on September 25 from his home along with cash and a handgun . Lewis is believed to be driving a blue 2004 Jeep Gran Cherokee which he stole from his stepfather on September 25, after returning home for an evening and beating and handcuffing him. He left home armed with cash, a 9mm handgun and more than 200 rounds of ammunition and Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio has said that 'We have to assume that he's armed.' Authorities now believe that Lewis has stolen license plates from Idaho within the past two weeks and the vehicle has no front fog lights and has a rear bumper sticker. The suspect is described as 6 feet 2 inches and 270 pounds with a tattoo of a demonic female figure on his right upper arm and a tattoo of a hand holding a knife with a broken handcuff on his chest. 'People should not approach him, obviously,' said Procopio to the Boston Herald. Lewis was arrested on August 5 and charged with raping the 13-year-old girl. He was released on $1,000 bail, a decision which left many dumbfounded. 'Certainly this gentleman should have never been released on bail,' said Southbridge Town Councilor Clemence to the Boston Herald. 'I hope that the judicial system will fix some of those mistakes because it’s wreaked havoc across the country.' The circumstances that allowed a suspected child rapist to flee on an alleged cross country raping spree began when Judge Michael Allard-Madaus set bail for Lewis at only $1,000 - but on the condition he wore a GPS ankle bracelet and stay away from anyone under 16. The suspect is described as 6 feet 2 inches and 270 pounds with a tattoo of a demonic female figure on his right upper arm and a tattoo of a hand holding a knife with a broken handcuff on his chest. While out on bail on September 15, he drove to the girl's house, in breach of his bail, removed his GPS tag and left it on her lawn and vanished. One week later, on September 23, ABC affiliate WSOC in Charlotte has reported that Lewis attacked a 29-year-old woman at a motel on Yorkmont Road. The woman who didn't want to use her name said Lewis told her she he lived in Charlotte. 'I met him on Plenty of Fish, a dating website,' the woman told WSOC by phone. It was just after arriving at the motel that Lewis began to attack the woman. 'He put me in a choke hold and put handcuffs on me with my hands behind my back and said I'm not going to hurt you I just want your money,' she said. to WSOC. The woman managed to engineer her escape after telling Lewis that most of her money was in her car. When they reached the parking lot, she fled. Police have released several surveillance photos of Lewis from recent days, but have admitted he may have shaved his facial hair. Two days after the North Carolina assault was when Lewis returned home to rob his stepfather. He then traveled in his Jeep Cherokee to Denver in early October and is suspected of committing robberies and rapes there. He then moved onto Portland, Oregon on or around October 13 and then moved onto Boise, Idaho and then in turn to Salt Lake City, Utah. He is then thought to have made his way back through Denver and was last spotted in Columbus, Ohio over the weekend. “We have reason to believe that Lewis is heading east again. We know that he was in the Columbus, Ohio, area Sunday evening and we know he was further west prior to that,” said state police spokesman David Procopio to the Boston Herald.","Gregory Lewis, 26, left his GPS monitor on the lawn of 13-year-old victim .

"Experts predict  Ray Rice's suspension from the NFL will be dropped by mid-November, leaving him ample time to find another team to join before the season is halfway over. But the true question lies in which team would be bold enough to him. The former Baltimore Ravens running back was fired from the team and put on indefinite leave on September 8, after surveillance footage was released showing the moment he struck his now-wife Janay Palmer in a hotel elevator. Back to work? The hearing over Ray Rice's suspension is scheduled for early November. If the suspension is dropped, he could potentially sign with a team by mid-season. Pictured above playing for the Baltimore Ravens . 'Wife beater': Rice was put on indefinite suspension on September 8 after surveillance footage was released showing the moment he struck his now-wife Janay in an Atlantic City elevator (left). The two went on to marry just a month later. Pictured on the right last month at a high school football game . Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is still investigating the incident, and the NFL's response, but the issue of Rice's suspension is expected to be decided before that inquiry is published. Rice maintains he did not lie under oath when questioned about the incident by Commissioner Roger Goodell. His legal team is expected to argue that even under the league's new domestic violence policy, first-time offender Rice could only be suspended for a maximum of six games. That amount of games has already passed. A hearing has been set for the beginning of November, which means Rice would find himself a new jersey by the middle of next month. CBSSports.com reports that two teams may take a chance by hiring Rice. The first is the Indianapolis Colts, whose coach Chuck Pagano used to work for the Ravens and 'thinks highly' of Rice. Another prospect is the New England Patriots, where coach Bill Belichick has strong ties to Rice's Rutgers University coach Greg Schiano. Prospects: CBS Sports speculates that Chris Pagano of the Colts (left) and Bill Belichick of the Patriots (right)  are two coaches perhaps willing to hire Rice .","The former Baltimore Ravens running back was fired from his team and suspended from the league last month after video was released showing the moment he punched his now-wife unconscious .

"Southampton fear Mauricio Pochettino will try to poach their top talent after he was confirmed as the new Tottenham manager on Tuesday. The Argentine has signed a five-year deal worth up to £3.5million a season to replace Tim  Sherwood, who was sacked earlier this month. Pochettino, who could make Saints striker Jay Rodriguez a top target, said: 'This is a club with tremendous history and prestige and I am honoured to have been given this opportunity to be its head coach. There is an abundance of top-class talent at the club and I look forward to starting work. New man in charge: Mauricio Pochettino has been named as the new manager of Spurs . 'Tottenham have a huge following across the world and I have great admiration for the passion the fans show for this team. We are determined to give the supporters the kind of attacking football and success that we are all looking to achieve.' Pochettino, 42, will be asked to coax the best out of record signing Erik Lamela, the Argentine who came from Roma for £30m. And he can expect a healthy budget to add to his squad, raising fears at St Mary's that he could return to recruit their top stars. Spurs are interested in midfielder Adam Lallana and striker Rodriguez, who is recovering from a knee injury that looks likely to keep him sidelined for the start of the new season but has flourished under Pochettino's tutelage. Moves for Lallana and Luke Shaw look out of reach as they head for Liverpool and Manchester United. But Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers, Nathaniel Clyne, Morgan Schneiderlin and James  Ward-Prowse have all excelled under Pochettino. Tough sell: Adam Lallana is admired by Pochettino but may prove to be out of reach for Tottenham . Heading to the Lane? Could Jay Rodriguez also follow Pochettino to Spurs? Southampton will attempt to stop any flow of talent to Spurs but agreements restricting a club from signing a player from a rival are complex and could contravene EU regulations. The South American formed a close bond with his squad during his 16 months at St Mary's and the prospect of following him could appeal to some players. Shaw thanked Pochettino on Twitter, saying: 'Great manager, great guy and has helped me a lot. Wish him all the best.' Following the boss? Both Nathaniel Clyne and Dejan Lovren had a good season at Southampton . But Pochettino faced a massive social media backlash from Saints supporters. The ex-Espanyol chief will bring his trusted aides Jesus Perez, Miguel D'Agostino and Toni Jimenez with him to Spurs. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said: 'In Mauricio I believe we have a head coach who, with his high energy and attacking football, will embrace the style of play we associate with our club. He has a proven ability to develop each player as an individual, while building great team spirit and a winning mentality. We have a talented squad that Mauricio is excited to be coaching next season.'","Saints players Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers, Nathaniel Clyne, Morgan Schneiderlin and James Ward-Prowse could be on Pochettino's radar .

"Carl Froch and George Groves are both convinced they will emerge victorious from their eagerly anticipated re-match at Wembley on Saturday. The pair were in confident mood at the final pre-fight press conference on Thursday, with Groves predicting exactly how he will knock out Froch in front of almost 80,000 fans at Wembley. 'It'll be the left hook that finishes Carl on Saturday night,' said Groves. Winning shot? George Groves has vowed to stop Carl Froch with a left hook at Wembley . Days away: Groves and Froch went head to head on the Wembley pitch after the press conference . Champion: Froch defends his WBA and IBF super middleweight titles at the national stadium in London . Team Groves: The challenger had a huge entourage at Wembley for the final press conference . 'Anyone who has watched the media workouts or the Behind the Ropes documentary will know we've been working on left hooks - the left hook will work.' Froch responded dryly: 'I better pick that right hand up then and get it by my chin.' Groves beats his chest, Froch rolls his eyes - it's been that way ever since Howard Foster's controversial ninth-round stoppage decided the pair's first fight in the latter's favour in November. Far from conclusive, Foster's intervention has given both fighters a platform for belief. For WBA and IBF super-middleweight champion Froch, it is confirmation that even with a poor performance, he can get over the line on the biggest stage. For Groves, it was injustice that scrubbed out his undeniable dominance through the majority of the contest. 'I 100 per cent know I can go 12 rounds - I could have gone 12 rounds the first time,' Groves said. 'That's why we're here right now, why it's being called unfinished business - we're picking up where the last fight left off and I plan to perform. 'I'm going to get better and better, round on round. 'I'm not going to give anything away but every round I'll be better and it's up to Carl to hang in there. 'I can go 12 rounds if need be, I can go more, I'm in fantastic shape and I'm going to be out there straight in my rhythm, straight in my groove.' Game on: Froch and Groves were remarkably calm at the final press conference at Wembley . Favourite: Froch is confident he can defend his two world titles at Wembley on Saturday . Almost there: Froch and Groves faced the media for the final time as they get ready to take to the ring . Froch came back: 'Hardcore boxing fans . know what I'm about. When I turn up in the shape I'm in now - you've . seen it time and time again against top, top opposition - I've proved I . can perform at the top level.' He continued: 'I mix it with the elite boxers in the world. 'I'm . bringing that confidence and that experience with me into this fight on . top of being at absolutely unbelievable shape which will allow me to . perform at my best for the whole duration of the fight if necessary. 'But I'm convinced this fight won't go the distance and that George Groves won't hear the final bell. 'Because I know what I have to do and how I'm going to do it.' At . 26, Groves is 10 years Froch's junior. The Londoner is lighter on his . feet than his opponent, sharper in his angles and swifter with his . hands. But Froch is durable, . cunning and with 32 professional victories out of 34 contests, his . experience will prove invaluable when the adrenaline is pumping. 'You're using the 36-year-old as a question mark around whether or not I can still do it at this level,' said Froch. Enter the champion: Froch makes his way into the final press conference at Wembley on Thursday . In your corner: Promoter Eddie Hearn (centre) is backing his man Froch to beat Groves for a second time . Shock start: Groves knocked Froch down in their first fight and dominated the opening stages . Premature? Referee Howard Foster stopped the fight in the ninth round when Groves came under pressure . 'But of course I've still got it what it takes and of course I can still do what I did in my twenties. 'I am performing, the output is there, I'm still doing it. It may be a cliche but age really is just a number.' Groves is determined to prove otherwise. 'I'm . going to perform on Saturday night and become world champion and do it . on the big stage looking very good doing it,' Groves said. 'In boxing you can be the most talented fighter out there but you need people to watch and I'm fortunate I'm in that situation. 'I will arrive on Saturday night - no stone has been left unturned, I'm fully prepared and I just can't wait.' As the duo stood up, television cameras jostled for position to catch the simmering square-up that preceded the first fight. There were no such dramatics this time, however. Froch . slapped his two world-title belts over his shoulder and Groves kept his . own company with a wry smile. The time for talking is over.","George Groves reveals he will knock Carl Froch out with a left hook .

"Descendants of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' wife have become the richest family in Germany. Magda Goebbels, who was one of the most influential women in the Nazi regime, married Hitler's close ally in 1931. The children of Harald Quandt, her son from a previous marriage, have just seen their family reach a combined net worth of about £24.5billion. Scroll down for video . Family photo: Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels with his wife Magda and their children, as well as Magda's son from a previous marriage, Harald Quandt (in uniform), whose family has become the richest in Germany . The Quandts, who hold a 46.7 per cent stake in German car manufacturers BMW, have now overtaken the founders of supermarket giants Lidl and Aldi, who had topped the nation's rich list for the last decade, according to Manager magazine. Magda Goebbels married Günther Quandt in 1921, three years after is wife died, leaving him a widower with two sons, Hellmut and Herbert. The newlyweds had a son soon afterwards, naming him Harald. Magda left Günther Quandt in 1929, marrying Goebbels two years later. Hitler was his best man. Harald lived with his mother and the Nazi minister until he joined the German army in 1939. He was in a British Prisoner of War camp in Libya when his mother's farewell letter from Hitler's Berlin bunker arrived. Joseph Goebbels was one of the most important and influential people in Nazi Germany. Hitler put him in charge of the party's propaganda machine in 1929 and he played a key role in implementing the dictator's agenda. His limp and sharp tongue earned him the nickname among some as the 'Poison Dwarf'. He organised attacks against Jews, banned them from the world of the arts and media, censored the news and supported Nazi propaganda films. As WWII turned in favour of the Allies, he increased his propaganda in order to convince the German people of the idea of 'total war' and mobilisation. Goebbels killed himself and his wife, and their six biological children with cyanide capsules the day after Hitler committed suicide in 1945. Many of Quandt family stay out of the public eye, but (from left to right) Johanna Quandt, Stefan Quandt and Susanne Klatten, major shareholders in BMW, are often seen at social gatherings . She wrote to Harald: 'It's likely that you'll be the only one to remain who can continue the tradition of our family.' Shortly after writing the letter, Magda and Goebbels murdered their six children and killed themselves as Soviet forces closed in on the bunker. Harald and his half-brother Herbert later inherited the Quandt fortune, built up by producing rifles and missiles for the Nazis, the Times reported. Herbert saved BMW from collapsing in the 1960s after backing new car models, and the huge success of the company since has seen the Quandts gradually climb the German rich list. Harald died in a plane crash in Italy in 1967 and Herbert died in 1982. The daughters of Harald Quandt, Coleen-Bettina Rosenblat-Mo, 51, Anette-Angelika May Thies, 59, Gabriele Quandt, 61, and Katarina Geller-Herr, 62, shy away from publicity despite their wealth. Herbert's widow, Johanna Quandt, 86, and their children, Stefan Quandt and Susanne Klatten, are often seen mingling with fellow shareholders of the car makers.","Magda Goebbels' descendants own a 46.7 per cent stake in BMW .

"Jason Kenny can appreciate the romance of winning gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, at a velodrome bearing the name of his friend Sir Chris Hoy, the greatest track cyclist Britain has produced and the man he has long been tipped to succeed. But, pleasant as a Commonwealth gold medal hanging round his neck might feel, Kenny knows it will not put food on the table or heat the house he shares with girlfriend and fellow cyclist Laura Trott. ‘We like to race for all the romantic reasons - to be Commonwealth champion - but we’re also racing to pay the bills and the bills just aren’t really paid at the Commonwealth Games,’ said Kenny. Loved up: Laura Trott and Jason Kenny are pictured alongside David Beckham at the London 2012 volleyball . Helping hand: Olympic gold medalists Laura Trott and Jason Kenny are training up the next generation of budding cyclists . Cool heads: The pair are not overly concerned about the British team¿s performance at the World Track Championships . ‘A lot of members of the public . probably see the Commonwealths as second only to the Olympics. But when . you’re actually involved in the sport it doesn’t seem that way. It gets . devalued a bit. It’s a real grey area, but for us it doesn’t fit into . any kind of category.’ It . is an admirably honest assessment of an event that critics see as . antiquated and irrelevant from a sporting perspective. But Kenny’s views . will come as a blow to Commonwealth Games organisers as they try to . lure the biggest stars to Scotland this summer. Even more worrying is . the fact they appear to be shared by Trott, another of Britain’s . most-loved athletes. ‘A lot . of people don’t even take it seriously,’ she told Sportsmail, ‘It’s the . same with a lot of countries. I went to Delhi (Commonwealth Games) as a . youngster (in 2010) and there was barely anyone there. It’s not the same . as a World Championships and it’s certainly not the same as an Olympic . Games.’ Both Kenny and . Trott recognise the financial benefits of winning gold at the Olympics. They took home two each at London 2012, a glorious fortnight that . concluded with their very public ‘outing’ as a couple, when a picture . emerged of them kissing while watching the beach volleyball sat behind . David Beckham and next to Prince Harry. Their success helped draw in . sponsorship and advertising deals. Top of the track: Kenny and Trott took home two golds each at London 2012 . Not convinced: Trott is unsure about the petition by Olympic team-mate Emma Pooley for a women¿s Tour de France . ‘It’s . the only time you get that kind of exposure,’ said Kenny, ‘For other . sports they get lots of exposure between the four years but for us, . every four years track cycling comes to the forefront and it’s important . for us to put on a big show.’ They . are back at the Lee Valley Velopark almost two years on, in their role . as ambassadors for Disney Aim High 2014 mentorship programme, training . up the next generation of budding cyclists. Although they don’t talk . about their relationship in public, they have a natural rapport, batting . ideas off each other. The . pair are not overly concerned about the British team’s performance at . the World Track Championships in Cali in March where their five medal . haul fell two short of Head Coach Shane Sutton’s target. ‘British . Cycling put a lot of emphasis on the Olympics so if we didn’t win . another gold medal until the Games in Rio, they’d prefer it than for us . to win four gold medals and then lose at the Games,’ said Trott, who won . silver in the omnium at the World Championships. ‘We . peak for the Olympics, we get all the equipment and everything thrown . at us for the Olympics whereas for the World Championships we don’t get . all that. So you’re definitely going to see dips in performance.’ The . men came home without any medals but Kenny, 26, is fierce in his belief . that gender is irrelevant in British Cycling’s success. ‘Medals . are medals no matter who wins them and what sex they are,’ said Kenny, . ‘If you want equality, which I’m assuming most women do, then you can’t . say, “We won all the gold medals” when you do. Laura’s gold medals are . worth just as much as mine. I think sport’s a good equaliser in that . sense.’ Partners: Trott and Kenny live together and regularly train together . Trott, 22, came . 55th in the inaugural Women’s Tour earlier this month, a professional . women’s road race on an unprecedented scale in Britain. She . said: ‘I think it’s a great step. It’s quite smart to say we don’t want . it to run alongside the men’s race. I think women’s road race will . continue to grow. It’s slowly getting bigger and it’s nice that GB is . leading the way.’ Trott . also endorses La Course by Le Tour, a one-day stage at the finish of . the Tour de France for women road racers but stops short of getting . behind the petition by Olympic teammate Emma Pooley and Dutch Olympic . road race champion Marianne Vos for a women’s Tour de France. She . says: ‘I’m not so swayed on the whole Tour de France idea. They do have . a stage race (La Course) but some women don’t agree with it because it . doesn’t go up the classic hills. But I just don’t think it should run . along the same course as the men’s because we would never, ever complete . 300km. You’d get two riders rolling in after 10 hours.' ‘There’d be deaths,’ Kenny predicts. Golden girls: Dani King, Trott and Joanna Rowsell of Great Britain pose with their medals at London 2012 . ‘I . just don’t think it would be realistic,’ adds Trott, ‘We ride a tour . for five days and at the end of it we’re completely knackered. For three . weeks - no chance. I certainly wouldn’t finish, put it that way.’ As . for the young girls Trott has been mentoring, she insists there are far . more positive female role models to inspire them than there were a . decade ago. ‘At the Olympics . there was a lot of female medal winners so they have a lot of women to . look up to,’ said Trott, ‘Ten years ago, there weren’t as many. For me . personally, when I was a child, I could play with what I wanted. 'If . I wanted to play with an action man, my parents would go buy me an . action man. It wasn’t stereotyped like that in our family. I guess sport . in itself has always been a male-dominated thing so it is a little more . equal now that there are more role models. ‘If a lady wants to go in the kitchen then she can but if she wants to go on a dirt bike then she can do that too.’ Laura Trott and Jason Kenny are training up the next generation of budding . cyclists as part of the Disney Aim High mentorship initiative. Four . children from across the UK were given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . to train with Britain’s best at the London Olympic VeloPark. The unique . experience will be shown on Disney Channel, Disney XD and . www.disney.co.uk/aimhigh from May 26.","Kenny and Laura Trott will compete at the Commonwealth Games .

"Germany is poised for its first deployment of troops in Ukraine since the Nazi invasion of then Soviet territory in 1941 which led to millions of deaths. An historic move to send 200 peacekeepers – including 50 paratroopers – was under active consideration last night. It comes as the crumbling ceasefire between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian government was under its strongest pressure since coming into effect a month ago. Scroll down for video .

Pictured: Donetsk International Airport damaged during fighting . A pro-Russian rebel tank rolls to take position near to the airport in the town of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine . Chancellor Angela Merkel has led European moves to secure peace in Ukraine, but until now Berlin has been reluctant to deploy even peacekeeping troops because of the country’s role in the Second World War. Almost seven million Soviet Ukrainian civilians and military personnel died during the war, it is estimated. Sources in Germany said it was in ‘exploratory discussions’ about taking part in an international force to protect monitors for the Organisation for Security Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on the ground in Ukraine amid deep concern of a return to full-scale violence in the east of the country. The West fears Vladimir Putin is determined to build an unofficial buffer state called Novorossiya – or New Russia – in eastern Ukraine. Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured) has led European moves to secure peace in Ukraine, but until now Berlin has been reluctant to deploy even peacekeeping troops because of the country’s role in the Second World War . A dozen pro-Putin separatists were killed yesterday in intense fighting for control of strategic Donetsk airport. Two Ukrainian soldiers also died.

"Luke Campbell became Great Britain's 28th Gold medalist tonight as he became the first boxer from these shores to claim top prize in the bantamweight category since 1908. The battling boxer from Hull earned Team GB another gold and was in tears after a noisy Anglo-Irish tear-up. Campbell, 24, overcame Ireland's John Joe Nevin who had to settle for silver in the 56kg bantamweight competition. Celebrations: Luke Campbell can;t hold back the tears after claiming gold tonight . Golden moment: Luke Campbell celebrates after wining the gold in the men's bantamweight 64-kg boxing . Home favourite Campbell was cheered on by a passionate local support - equally matched by followers of Irish traveller Nevin. But . it was the Union flags held highest after judges gave the decision . 14-11 to Campbell to the delight of the majority of the 10,000 sell-out . crowd at the ExCel arena. Campbell raised his hands in triumph - then burst into tears as the crowd chanted 'Campbell! Campbell!' Tears of joy: There were tears for both boxers following a tight final which saw Luke Campbell (left) win Team GB's 28th gold medal tonight . Speaking to the BBC afterwards he said: I'm lost for words, very emotional. It's something I've worked for all my life. 'I . can't believe it. Nevin's a top fighter, it was a very difficult fight, . very technical. It was just about outwitting each other. Going for gold: Britain's Luke Campbell overcame Irish boxer John Joe Nevin in his bantamweight final tonight to scoop a memorable gold . 'I had to be on my game to win and thankfully I was. I can't believe it. I'm very proud to be from Hull and I really appreciate all the support both there and here in London. Thanks.' He left his mother shaking like a leaf after boxing his way to Olympic glory, Jill Campbell, 53, who told her little boy to 'find a safer sport' said: 'I was shaking from head to foot and I still am. 'At the moment it just feels amazing. To see him up there on the podium, it just felt so unreal, like it was happening to somebody else.' Mrs Campbell said her husband Barney, 54, was unwell with a serious back problem so could not travel to watch his son win gold - but got a call from his wife as soon as their son triumphed. 'He said, 'I told you. I told you all, his day would come',' Mrs Campbell added. 'He has always believed in him, straight from the start he always said, 'Luke, one day, will be stood there with a gold medal'.' Mrs Campbell, who has two other sons, Kane, 23 and Christopher, 32, and a daughter Kirsty, added: 'He's got such a talent. His whole presence, he's calm, collected and he thinks about things. He doesn't rush into anything.' After saluting the cheering home fans Campbell left the ring to embrace girlfriend Lynsey Kraanen, the mother of his 18-month-old son Leo. The couple are expecting another child as she is almost six months pregnant. Ms Kraanen, 24, said: 'This morning I was really emotional and scared about him getting in the ring, then all of a sudden we all got this amazing confidence. 'We all feel on top of the world. We are going to have a really big party for him next Friday.' The fighter's best friend Kenny Marsden, 27, from Hull, with tears in his eyes, added: 'This is like a dream come true, it's unbelievable. Close bout: John Joe Nevin of Ireland, in red, and Luke Campbell of Great Britain, in blue, could only be separated by three points at the final bell . Triumph: Campbell pauses as he listens to the National Anthem complete with gold medal round his neck . 'What people don't realise is he's worked so hard for it - all his life. It's not just training, it's 24/7 with him. He is totally dedicated and deserves this so much.' He follows fellow Brit boxer Nicola Adams, who made history after becoming the first ever gold medalist in women's boxing. As a chubby, angel-faced 13-year-old Luke Campbell decided he fancied having a go at boxing. His family did not fight and he knew no boxers but as soon as he walked into his local boxing club in Hull with his brother Kane, the teenager was hooked. In action: Great Britain's Luke Campbell floors his opponent as he heads towards a historic gold . Just two years later, Campbell was representing England on the international stage.

'My . real hero in life is my mum,' he told the Hull Daily Mail. 'She's like a . real workhorse, she provides for the family, is always out working. That's where I get my determination from.' Fighting back: Ireland's John Joe Nevin came back at Campbell but it was not enough to take the gold off the Brit . Winner: His win took Team GB's gold medal tally to 28 following Ed McKeever and Mo Farah in another great night . But he is equally dedicated to his . sport, and says St Paul's Boxing Academy, where he got his first taste . of boxing more than a decade ago, is like a second home. He . said: 'I don't know what drove me to the sport, it was just something I . fancied doing. There was no influence in my family because no-one . boxed. I didn't know any boxers. I went to the gym round the corner from . my house with my brother and found out about St Paul's after the first . season. 'I moved to St Paul's and have been here ever since. From the moment I walked through the front door it felt like home.' He said the team at St Paul's did not just teach him about boxing but also gave him an education in life. Gold-en moment: The 24-year-old from Hull on his way to winning gold against Ireland's own medal hope John Joe Nevin . Victory: Campbell cannot contain his delight after his memorable victory, which saw Ireland claim silver . It was a lesson that has served him well. Campbell became England's first European champion for 47 years in 2008. He took the silver medal in last year's World Championships, ranking him number two in the world in the bantamweight division. A hand injury stopped him fighting for 10 . months in 2009 but he was fully recovered by the following year, going . 23 bouts unbeaten and leading GB Boxing's Performance Director to . describe him as the benchmark for the rest of the boxers in the squad.

Reporters traveling with first family on vacation said the president spent just under half an hour biking with his wife and daughter before breaking away to hit the links. Obama is playing his fifth game of golf today since arriving on the island. He was joined today by 32 Advisors Founder and CEO Robert Wolf. Wolf is a hedge fund and money manager who served on Obama's now-defunct Jobs Council.

"Dias Kadyrbayev, 20, admitted in federal court that he removed Tsarnaev's laptop from his dorm room . A college friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded guilty  to impeding the investigation by removing incriminating evidence from Tsarnaev's dorm room several days after the deadly attack. Dias Kadyrbayev, 20, admitted in federal court that he removed Tsarnaev's laptop computer and a backpack containing fireworks that had been emptied of their explosive powder from Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Twin bombs placed near the finish line of the 2013 marathon killed three people and injured more than 260. Under a plea agreement, federal prosecutors said they would ask for no more than seven years in prison. The agreement allows his lawyer to argue for a lesser sentence. Kadyrbayev also agreed not to fight deportation after he completes his prison sentence. U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock set sentencing for November 18, but did not immediately accept the plea agreement, saying he first wanted to review a report that will be prepared by the probation department. Kadyrbayev's decision to plead guilty came just two weeks before he was scheduled to go on trial and a month after his friend and co-conspirator, Azamat Tazhayakov, was convicted of identical charges by a jury. During Tazhayakov's trial, prosecutors described Kadyrbayev as the leader in the decision to remove the items, but said Tazhayakov agreed with the plan. They said Kadyrbayev was the one who actually threw away the backpack and fireworks, which were later recovered in a landfill. Kadyrbayev's lawyer, Robert Stahl, said his client made a 'terrible error in judgment that he's paying for dearly.'

Dias Kadyrbayev, 20, admitted in federal court that he removed the backpack containing fireworks that had been emptied of their explosive powder from Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth . Stahl emphasized that Kadyrbayev — a native of Kazakhstan who came to the U.S. in 2011 on a student visa — 'had absolutely no knowledge' that Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, were planning to bomb the marathon and was 'shocked and horrified' when he learned they were suspects. He said Kadyrbayev, who was 19 at the time, 'now understands he never should have gone to that dorm room, and he never should have taken any items from that room.' His plea agreement with prosecutors does not make any mention of him agreeing to testify against a third friend who was also charged. Robel Phillipos, of Cambridge, is accused of lying to investigators about being present when Kadyrbayev took the items from Tsarnaev's room.

Azamat Tazhayakov and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pictured here in a photo prior to April 2013 . Phillipos is scheduled to go on trial next month. Typically, plea agreements describe whether defendants have given substantial assistance to prosecutors and have agreed to testify against co-defendants. The backpack, fireworks and laptop were taken from Tsarnaev's room hours after the FBI publicly released photographs and videos of Tsarnaev and his brother as suspects in the bombing. Prosecutors said Kadyrbayev exchanged text messages with Tsarnaev after seeing the photos. They said Tsarnaev, texted the pair while he was on the run, telling them: 'If you want to go to my room and take what's there.' 'Ha Ha :)' Tazhayakov responded. Prosecutors said the fireworks had been emptied of explosive powder that can be used to make bombs. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. His trial is scheduled to begin in November.

"The mother of a 12-year-old girl killed by a teenage boy told a judge today: 'I am living every parents' worst nightmare'. Jennifer Cornwall, condemned the 17-year sentence handed down to the boy who ended her daughter, Autumn's, life, as 'a gift he did not deserve' and said: 'I hope the defendant is haunted by her memory for the rest of his life'. Justin Robinson, 16, had pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter last month, and admitted strangling the Clayton Middle School student to death in October last year. Off to jail: Justin Robinson, who pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter in the death of Autumn Pasquale, leaves the courtroom after being sentenced to 17 years in prison . Autumn Pasquale was brutally murdered in October in her hometown of Clayton, New Jersey, . Clues: Justin Robinson 'liked' the Facebook page set up to find Autumn despite knowing she was already dead . He apologized to the family and said, 'This was not supposed to happen,' as he called the killing a 'mistake.' The New Jersey teenager had lured Autumn to his home with an offer to trade bicycle parts. Prosecutors faced difficulties during the trial including a lack of . physical evidence to determine whether he or his brother Dante Robinson, then 17, . killed Autumn and they struggled for provide a motive for the killing.. The teenager will now spend the next half . of his life in prison for the crime, however he will be eligible for parole after 14½ years. 'I'm sorry. I never meant for this to happen,' he told Judge Walter Marshall. 'This was all a big mistake.' Relatives of the girl did not see it . that way, and some wanted the judge to issue a tougher sentence than the . one agreed to in a plea agreement. More than 8,500 people signed an . online petition at change.org demanding a stiffer term, but Superior . Court Judge Walter Marshall Jr. in Gloucester County accepted a plea . deal agreement and the sentence of 17 years. During Thursday's sentencing, family . and friends of Autumn  — many who were hoping for a harsher sentence — . packed one side of the courtroom. Autumn's parents spoke of their pain since losing their daughter. Addressing the court, Autumn . Pasquale's father Anthony said that Robinson's sentence was not nearly . long enough and called him a 'murderer who does not deserve to live. 'I believe the defendant deserves . more than 17 years,' said Mr  Pasquale, who as a mail carrier had . delivered letters to Robinson's family in Clayton, where the families . of the victim and her killer had deep roots. 'I believe his fate should . be nothing but death.' When he pleaded guilty, Justin . Robinson said he acted alone. During a sentencing proceeding, neither . he, his lawyers, nor prosecutors shed light on a motive for the killing, . or even what happened beyond what was already known: Pasquale went to . his house several blocks from hers after receiving a Facebook offer to . trade bike parts on Oct. 20. When she didn't return home that night, her . family, then the entire community, set off in a frantic search. Two . days later, her body was found in a recycling bin behind the home next . to Robinson's. A break in the case for investigators . came when the boy's mother, Anita Saunders, called police after seeing . something troubling in a Facebook post from one of her sons. Speaking briefly during the . sentencing, Saunders told the judge that media accounts of what happened . were incorrect. 'Nobody knows exactly what happened the day of the . accident,' she said. Emotional: Jennifer Cornwell, mother of slain child Autumn Pasquale, leaves the courtroom table after making a statement about her daughter during the sentencing of Justin Robinson . Robinson's lawyer, Jean Faulkner, . told the judge that the boy had post-traumatic stress disorder from . being physically abused as a young boy and seeing his father strangle . his mother more than once. 'This is a learned behavior,' Faulkner said. Pasquale's family told the judge . about Autumn, whom they described as a loving tomboy who wore . mismatched socks and loved to ride her BMX bike. They talked about how her . disappearance and death touched the town, located 25 miles southeast of . Philadelphia. Her old soccer team, once known as the Clayton Comets, is . now Autumn's Angels; her jersey number, 14, has been retired from the . Clayton Middle School sports teams; a bike path and a park are now named . for her. And they told the judge how members . of the family, including her siblings and young cousins, are in therapy . and dealing with nightmares about her death. 'When I see the blue recycling bins . out, I cry to think Autumn's innocent life was so easily discarded like a . piece of trash,' said the girl's maternal grandmother, Mary Pasquale, . who had taught Justin Robinson in school. A slide show of pictures of Autumn were projected onto a screen in the courtroom. About a dozen family members recalled her as happy, lively young girl who made others laugh. Upset: Anthony Pasquale, father of slain child Autumn Pasquale spoke in court saying her killer Justin Robinson did not deserve to live . Autumn Pasquale's body was found in a recycling bin on an abandoned property next door to Justin's brother's Donte's home. She was found just days after she went missing in October and the brothers were arrested within hours of her body being located. Police . believe the teens lured 12-year-old 'tomboy' Autumn to their home under . the pretense of trading bike parts and killed her. Autumn . was promised parts for her bike by the two, authorities said, but the . teenagers were really plotting to steal parts from her model. The . house was a place where teens frequently hung out and had parties, some . neighbors said, and one of the brothers often bought and sold BMX . bicycle parts, the teenagers said. Eventually, the boys' own mother turned them in when she noticed a suspicious posting on one of her son's Facebook pages . An . autopsy concluded Autumn had died from 'blunt force trauma, consistent . with strangulation'. She was also beaten. There was no evidence of . sexual assault. The boys themselves were in plain sight . at points in the intense search for Autumn. Several people in town said . they saw them both at the vigil held on Monday night in hopes that she . would be found while allegedly knowing exactly where she was. Guilty: Justin (pictured left) will now spend the next half of his life behind bars. He plead guilty in August to choking Autumn last year. His brother Donte Robinson (pictured right) has also been charged with the murder . Innocent: Autumn went round to the brothers house to trade BMX bike parts. Instead, they killed her . Autumn's . disappearance in October brought together the southern New Jersey town . where she lived and - briefly - reunited her parents who had been . separated since 2002. Though the parents legally had joint custody, Autumn and her siblings spent most of their time living with their father. While Donte’s charges are still pending in juvenile court, Justin Robinson admitted last month to being the sole person responsible for luring Autumn to his house and strangling her to death. Judge Walter Marshall recommended Robinson start his sentence in a youth corrections facility with the state. Marshall also described the crime as a 'particularly cruel manner of death' which was something he weighed heavily in his decision. Devastated: Autumn's mother and father, Anthony Pasquale and Jennifer Cornwell, said their daughter was treated 'like a piece of trash' Life cut short: Authorities found some of Autumn¿s belongings in the teens' house including the white BMX bike she was last seen riding when she left her West High Street home in the New Jersey town . Death wish: Autumn Pasquale's mother Jennifer Cornwell and father Anthony Pasquale say they wish her murderers could be given the death penalty . The Robinson boys' mother also spoke briefly during the hearing. 'Nobody knows what happened the day . of the accident,' she said, as the audience booed audibly. 'The accident . has been mischaracterized.'She added that she knows her son is 'filled with remorse.' Outside . the courthouse, a crowd of protesters gathered as they waited for word . on the judge's decision. Prosecutors agreed to allow Robinson . to plea to aggravated manslaughter rather than murder because of challenges . with the case. Because of his age and a developmental disability, it was . not a sure thing that he would be moved to adult court. If he had been . convicted of murder in juvenile court, he could have had a chance of . parole in less than seven years. Justin's brother Donte will be tried in a juvenile court later this year. Grim discovery: Gloucester County prosecutors found the body of Autumn Pasquale in a bin just blocks from her house . OCTOBER 20, 2012: Autumn Pasquale, who was a week away from her 13th birthday, was last seen riding her BMX bicycle, leaving her home in Clayton, New Jersey. Authorities – from the Gloucester County police to the FBI – joined the search. Her father, Tony Pasquale, told NBC News at the time that the disappearance was ‘not like her'. OCTOBER 21: Hundreds of people gathered at a local church to hand out flyers and form search parties for the freckled blonde. OCTOBER 22: Hundreds more join search efforts for Autumn, spanning into Delaware and New York. After sunset, worried friends and family held a candlelit vigil to pray for her safe return. Not long after the vigil ended, authorities said that they discovered her 5ft2in body dumped in a recycling container five blocks from her home. OCTOBER 23: A press conference was held in the afternoon to say that two brothers, aged 15 and 17, had been arrested for Autumn’s murder. Authorities also said that the brother’s mother, spotting a suspicious post on Facebook, turned them into police. AUGUST 7, 2013: Justin Robinson, 16, pleads guilty to aggravated manslaughter.

"A family is outraged as officials from Habersham County, Georgia say they won’t foot the $800,000 medical bills they 'publicly promised to pay' for a toddler injured by a grenade during a police raid. Bounkham Phonesavanh, known as 'Baby Bou Bou', was 19 months old when he was seriously injured by a grenade that went off in his crib as he slept during an early morning drug raid on May 28. 'They had made it publicly known that they were going to take care of any medical expenses that our son had acquired,' said the boy's mother Alecia Phonesavanh. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Healing: Bounkham Phonesavanh, who was 19 months when injured by a grenade during a drug raid, is healing but the county says they wont foot the medical bills . Disfigured: Surgeons repaired the boy's lung so he no longer needs a ventilator and patched and re-attached his nose that had been detached as well as repaired injuries to his lips and mouth . Come a long way: Baby Bou Bou has improved greatly since he was first injured in May during the raid . 'That is a very big problem,' said Phonesavanh to Fox. 'And my family and I want to make it clear to the county and everybody elsethat we will not give up this fight.' The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports that SWAT officers threw the grenade into his room during a search warrant for a drug suspect. On Friday . afternoon the family's attorney said that the medical bills are piling . up and the county is not taking responsibility for them. 'But at this point, the county is refusing to pay,' said attorney Muwali Davis. The . attorney for Habersham County stated, 'The question before the board was . whether it is legally permitted to pay these expenses. After . consideration of this question following advice of counsel, the board . of commissioners has concluded that it would be in violation of the law . for it to do so.' Baby Bou Bou is doing much better after recovering at two different hospitals and was able to go home with his family in July. The little boy looks dramatically better than in the shocking picture released after the horrific incident which caused a brain injury, collapsed a lung and disfigured his face. Surgeons repaired the boy’s lung so he no longer needs a ventilator and patched and re-attached his nose that had been detached by the explosion as well as repaired injuries to his lips and mouth. He also lost his left nipple. The medical bills continue to pile up as he recovers, . Expensive: Baby Bou Bou's parents feel as though the county is culpable for their sons injuries and they believe that they should pay . The damage: This photo shows Baby Bou Bou's crib after the grenade hit back in May . The Phonesavahs' attorney also makes the point that police may have received false information in order to gain a search warrant into their home. A Habersham County sheriff said that back in June an informant told them that they bought drugs at the house but that they didn't think any children lived there. In the wake of the incident, Boo Boo's mom Alecia Phonesavanh has spoken out about abuse of power by police officers. The target: Law enforcement threw a grenade into Baby Bou Bou's family residence . The incident had occurred while she was staying with her husband, their three daughters and their baby son in the living room of her sister-in-law's home just outside of Atlanta after their Wisconsin home burnt down. The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports that they didn't find who they were looking for in the home and that an ongoing investigation in underway. Baby Bou Bou and his family have moved back to Wisconsin and supporters of the family are planning a fundraiser for the boy in August. 'This is happening every day to people [who are] being relentlessly and unnecessarily militarized by police who think just because they're supposed to be upholding the law, they are above the law themselves,' said Bou Bou's mother. 'It’s time to remind the cops that they should be serving and protecting our neighborhoods, not waging war on the people in them. Before the injury: Before Baby Bou Bou was struck by a grenade, he was a happy and healthy boy .

"To reassure the people of Ferguson, Attorney General Eric Holder reached into his own past, recalling the times he had been stopped by police officers who seemed to target him because of his race. On a visit to the St. Louis suburb that has endured more than a week of unrest, Holder sought to build confidence in the investigation into the death of the black 18-year-old who was shot by a white officer. The trip also underscored the priority to the Obama administration of civil rights in general and the Michael Brown case in particular. Bridges: Attorney General Eric Holder stops to shake hands with a patron at Drake's Place Restaurant, before his meeting with local community leaders on Wednesday . The attorney general said Wednesday that he understands why many black Americans do not trust police and that he has experienced many of the same frustrations. He described being stopped twice on the New Jersey Turnpike and accused of speeding. Police searched his car, looking through the trunk and under the seats. 'I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me,' Holder said during a meeting with about 50 community leaders at the Florissant campus of St. Louis Community College. Once while living in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, Holder was running to catch a movie with his cousin when a squad car rolled up and flashed its lights at the pair. The officer yelled, . 'Where are you going? Hold it!' Holder recalled. His cousin 'started mouthing off,' and Holder urged him to be quiet. We negotiate the whole thing, and we walk to our movie. At the time that he stopped me, I was a federal prosecutor. I wasn't a kid,"" he said. Holder also met with federal officials investigating Brown's August 9 death and with Brown's parents. Before getting briefed at the local FBI headquarters, he said he hoped the visit would 'have a calming influence' on the area. In addition, the attorney general met briefly with Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who has been in charge of security in Ferguson for nearly a week. The National Guard is also helping to keep the peace. Asked whether he had confidence in the local investigation of the police officer, Johnson said Holder's presence 'is a guarantee on that.' In nearby Clayton, a grand jury began hearing evidence to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death. Anger: Protesters stand in the street as lightning flashes in the night sky in Ferguson, Missouri on Wednesday night . A spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch said there was no timeline for the process, but it could take weeks. Johnson said just six people were arrested at protests Wednesday night, compared to 47 the previous night. Information provided to The Associated Press from St. Louis County showed that 163 people have been arrested in Ferguson's protest area in the wake of Brown's death — but only seven of those arrested are from Ferguson. The vast majority of arrests — 126 — have been for failure to disperse. Twenty-one burglary-related arrests have been made, and four people are accused of assaulting police.

Legal opinions: Attorney General Eric Holder, (left), listens during his meeting at the U.S. Attorney's office in St. Louis, on Wednesday with local St. Louis politicians and lawyers . Meanwhile, St. Louis police released video showing officers killing a knife-wielding man on Tuesday. The video shows the man saying, 'Kill me now' as he moved toward two officers. Both fired six shot, killing the man, 25-year-old Kajieme Powell. The incident happened in north St. Louis, about five miles from where Brown was shot. The St. Louis shooting briefly spurred a gathering of about 150 people who chanted, 'Hands up, don't shoot,' a chant that has become common among protesters in Ferguson.

But following an investigation into the matter, it was revealed that due to a legislative change, police now do not have the authority to make an arrest on such unique warrants.

A tape not initially turned over shows a second police car coming from the opposite direction, crossing the median into ongoing traffic, and then striking Jeter's car. 'It was incredible, I didn't believe it at that point in time,' he told WABC. 'The next thing I know, one of them busts the door and there is glass all over my face. The footage shows police drew their guns on Meter after pulling him over and accused him of resisting arrest . 'As soon as they opened the door, one officer reached in an punched me in my face. 'As he's trying to take off my seatbelt, I'm thinking something is going to go wrong. The video shows the officers telling Jeter to stop resisting, however he doesn't appear to be fighting back. 'All I keep saying is I'm not doing anything,' Jeter said. 'They handcuffed me and one of them hits me in the back.' The prosecution had not seen the video despite pushing ahead with their charges against Meter. Interestingly, an earlier investigation by Bloomfield Police Department's internal affairs division found no wrongdoing by the officers involved. Prosecution were pursuing a five year jail sentence for Meter.

"Residents of a small Florida town say they're shocked and disgusted by the recent disclosure that two members of its police force are accused of being members of the Ku Klux Klan. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement this week released a report saying Fruitland Park Deputy Chief David Borst and Officer George Hunnewell were Klan members. Borst denies being a member. Borst resigned and Hunnewell was fired last week. A third Fruitland Park officer resigned in 2010 after his Klan ties became public. Scroll down for video . Florida's Fruitland Park Deputy Chief David Borst (right) and Officer George Hunnewell (left) were linked to the Ku Klux Klan, according to a new report . A researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center says it's extremely rare nowadays to find police officers who are Klan members. Cases the officers worked on also are under scrutiny. On Friday, prosecutors dismissed three cases - two traffic offenses and a misdemeanor battery. Local residents in town of less than 5,000 residents, reacted with disgust to the news. Chery Mion told The Miami Herald: 'I'm shocked, very shocked. I didn't think that organization was still around. Yes, in the 1950s. But this 2014, and it's rather disconcerting to know.' Borst, a veteran officer with more than 20 years of law enforcement service, resigned and Hunnewell was fired last week. A phone number listed for Borst was disconnected. Hunnewell's number was not listed. Ann Hunnewell claimed she and her ex-husband, George Hunnewell, joined the KKK in 2008 at the request of then-Police Chief Mark Isom, it was revealed last week. She said they were trying to find out if another officer was a KKK member. After investigating, she and her ex-husband later left the group. Ann Hunnewell was a secretary for the police department before leaving in 2010. Her statements were contained in the report tying Hunnewell and Borst to the KKK. The information about the former officers was given to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement by the FBI. Parts of the Florida report were redacted and it's not clear what the FBI was investigating when it discovered the officers link to the KKK. Police Chief Terry Isaacs stands in the hallway at the Police Department in Fruitland Park, Florida. Two of his police officers are no longer with the city after a law enforcement report tied them to the Ku Klux Klan . Ann Hunnewell told investigators that she and her former husband never paid dues, attended meetings or witnessed any criminal activity. She also said there was no documentation of their undercover operation. Fruitland Park has 13 full-time and five part-time cops, and many were trained by Borst. In 2009, Fruitland Park Police Officer James Elkins resigned after pictures surfaced of him in uniform with a pointy Klan hood and robe. The police department has 13 officers for the city has about 5,000 residents. It is located about 40 miles north-west of Orlando. Fruitland Park was once known for its citrus groves and is in Lake County, where KKK violence in the 1940s and 1950s was rampant.

"Boris Johnson today promised to be blasted with a water cannon to prove they are safe, after he ordered three to use on the streets of London. The London Mayor went ahead with the order without Home Secretary Theresa May sanctioning their use, fuelling tensions between the senior Tories. Challenged on the radio to face a cannon himself, Mr Johnson said: 'Man or mouse. Alright, you've challenged me to this. I suppose I'm going to have to do it now.' Boris Johnson, pictured on a visit to London Fire Brigade this week, said he was prepared to face a water cannon to prove they are safe . Purchase: Boris Johnson has fuelled tensions at the top of the Tory Party after buying Britain's first water cannon for use by mainland police, similar to this German version . Mr Johnson claimed that by spending £130,000 on buying, refitting and transporting three second-hand vehicles from German police now, before they are approved for use, he will save Londoners £2.4 million in the long term. Challenged on LBC radio by interviewer Nick Ferrari to be filmed standing in front of the water cannon, Mr Johnson initially seemed reluctant, telling him: . 'I'm certainly prepared to do anything to show that they're safe within reason. I'm not quite sure whether I want to stand in front of a water cannon, I haven't done anything to deserve it.' But after a few moments' consideration, he came round to the idea, telling Ferrari: 'OK. Man or mouse. Alright, you've challenged me to this. I suppose I'm going to have to do it now. 'I'm doing this unfortunately from off-base, so I can see all my poor press people are going to be tearing their hair out. Never mind, it's got to be done. Thanks for that one, Ferrari!' Mr Ferrari suggested that he and the Mayor could stand in front of the cannon together, wearing bright yellow fishermen's oilskin and sou'wester to protect them from the water. Water . cannon have been allowed in Northern Ireland since the Troubles but . cannot be deployed in England and Wales without Mrs May’s approval. Mr Johnson and Mrs May are seen as candidates to succeed David Cameron if he fails to achieve a majority at next year’s General Election and stands aside. Sources at Mr Johnson’s City Hall headquarters told The Times that the Mayor was ‘frustrated’ at the lack of decision-making by the Home Office. One said: ‘Boris is the mayor, policing in London is his responsibility, this is his money and he is of the view that this is what is needed. ‘The Metropolitan Police have been asking for water cannon since the riots of August 2011.’ Sources close to Mr Johnson also say that he largely ignores Mrs May  to the point ‘he almost never  mentions her’. Rivals: Theresa May has not yet sanctioned the use of water cannon and the action by the Mayor of London will be seen as a challenge to her authority in the wake of the 'Trojan Horse' row over Islamic extremism in schools . The police are allowed to use water cannons on the streets of Northern Ireland and have done so on several occasions . A . document from the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime said: ‘While it . was the original intention to wait for the Home Secretary to take a . decision to authorise the use of water cannon, this process is proving . time consuming.’ Mrs May, . who has overtaken Mr Johnson in recent months as the clear favourite to . succeed Mr Cameron, is known to regard the Mayor as a ‘faintly . ridiculous’ figure. Mr Johnson’s apparent challenge  follows claims that . the recent spat between the Mrs May and Education Secretary Michael . Gove was partly fuelled by rivalry for the Tory leadership. Of the three water cannons, two will work in tandem while a third is held in reserve . Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London (left), is in favour of water cannons while Green London Assembly member Jenny Jones (right) thinks that they are just 'big boys' toys' Senior Met officers want to buy three 23-year-old German water cannon for around £30,435 each before the summer. The vehicles carry up to 2,000 gallons of water and can travel at speeds comparable to an HGV. Up to £130,000 will need to be spent to convert the machines, buy additional equipment and train officers to work alongside them. Water in the vehicles’ tanks is heated to 41F (5C) to prevent the ‘onset of medical conditions associated with the shock of being exposed to cold water’. They can be refilled from hydrants or open water and two machines must be used in tandem as a third is kept in reserve. A report revealed by the Government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory found there was ‘good evidence’ that their use had led to serious injuries. Baroness . Jenny Jones, who sits on a body which scrutinises the Met Police, said . Mr Johnson may be ‘over confident’ in buying the machines. She said: ‘It is a possible waste of taxpayers’ money at a time when the Met is struggling to keep officers on the frontline. ‘It is . also ignoring the views of the vast majority of Londoners who don’t want . water cannon, think they will suppress legitimate protest or are a . distraction from the police’s main role. ‘We’ve . heard that water cannon would have been useless in the riots, so what . exactly will they be for? It’s just another big boy’s toy that we can’t . afford.’ Earlier this year, Mr Johnson urged police to get ‘medieval’ on . rioters as he threw his weight behind proposals to buy water cannon. He said . police must never again be left powerless in the face of overwhelming . violence like that seen during the 2011 riots. But he stressed the . chances of the machines being used in the capital, or other mainland . cities, remained ‘vanishingly rare’. Police . argue water cannon would be useful in a static confrontation where there . is a need to create space between police lines and violent crowds. They said . it could have helped protect firefighters and paramedics after shops . were set ablaze as rioting spread to Croydon in 2011.","Boris Johnson buys Britain's first water cannon for use by mainland police .

"The family of the black teenager shot dead by a policeman in St Louis are haunted by the image of him holding his hands up at the moment he was killed, a family member claimed today. Ty Pruitt said that the mental picture of Michael Brown surrendering was stuck in his relatives’ minds as it showed he was ‘killed like an animal’. Pruitt spoke out at an emotional Sunday church service during which Brown’s mother Lesley McSpadden sobbed and wiped the tears away from her eyes with a tissue. His father Michael Brown Sr stood grim faced whilst wearing a T-shirt with his son’s picture on it and the slogan: ‘No Justice, No Peace’. Scroll down for videos . Cousin: Ty Pruitt, cousin of Michael Brown, raised his hands at the podium and said 'This was the last action that our family member made before he went to rest' Emotional: Lesley McSpadden, mother of slain Michael Brown, wipes away a tear at Greater Grace Church on Sunday . Parents: Michael Brown Sr. and ex-wife Lesley McSpadden sit next to one another at the service . The service was the first time the family had attended church on a Sunday since the death of Brown, 18, who was killed on August 9th. He was shot in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, by officer Darren Wilson, 28, even though witnesses claim he had his hands up and was giving up. Brown's death has sparked seven nights of protests and rioting in Ferguson after it ignited long standing racial tensions between African American residents and the mostly white police force. Protesters around the world have been putting their hands up and chanting: ‘Hands up, don’t shoot’ in what has become their trademark gesture. The service at a the Greater Grace church just north of Ferguson was packed with 1,000 people and another 500 outside who were unable to get in. Among the guests was Missouri State Highway Patrol captain Ron Johnson, who is in charge of policing the riots, and civil rights campaigner Rev Jesse Jackson. McSpadden sat next to Brown Sr, her ex-husband, wearing sunglasses, a white shirt and dark trousers. On their right was the Rev Al Sharpton. Addressing the crowd Pruitt, Brown's cousin, said: ‘What I want you all to remember is that Michael Brown was not just some young black boy. He was a human being, he was a younger cousin, he was a son, he was an uncle, a nephew, he was not a suspect, he was not an object, he was not an animal - but that’s how he was killed.’ Victim: Michael Brown's Aug 9 death has been followed by protests criticizing the Ferguson police department . Heartbreak: Speaking about the image of Brown holding his hands up, Pruitt said 'This will be stuck in my family's memories for the rest of our lives' Exchange: Rev. Al Sharpton, far left, speaks with Michael Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden, as Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr, looks on . Holding his hands up, he said: ‘This was the last action that our family member made before he went to rest. ‘This will be stuck in my family’s memories for the rest of our lives’. The family were also represented by their lawyer Benjamin Crump, who was the attorney for relatives of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot dead in Florida by a neighbourhood watch coordinator. Crump told the crowd that there was ‘nothing that can justify the execution style murder in broad daylight’ of Brown. He also accused the Ferguson police department of trying to ‘smear’ Brown by putting out a CCTV video that apparently showed him robbing cigars from a grocery store minutes before he was killed. As Brown Sr cheered, Crump said: ‘They tried it with Trayvon, now they’re trying it with Michael.’ Taking a stand: Brown's parents stood at the podium, alongside their attorney Benjamin Crump. Crump previously represented the parents of Florida shooting victim Trayvon Martin . Impassioned: Pruitt said in his speech that his cousin Michael Brown was 'was not an animal - but that's how he was killed' Police: Missouri State Highway Patrol captain Ron Johnson appeared at the service and said he felt for Brown's parents . The service came against a background of ongoing unrest in Ferguson. On Saturday night Missouri governor Jay Nixon imposed a midnight curfew but a crowd of 200 defied the order and stayed on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson. Heavily armed SWAT teams fired on them with tear gas and caused them to run into the nearby housing estate. During his speech Johnson won three standing ovations and addressed Brown's family directly. He said: 'My heart goes out to you. I wear this uniform and I should stand up here and say that I'm sorry'. Thomas Jackson, the embattled Ferguson police chief, has so far refused to apologise. Speaker: The Rev.

"This is the incredibly heartwarming moment a mechanic answered the call and fixed an Afghan war veteran’s broken prosthetic leg in the middle of an airport. Taylor Morris, a quadruple amputee, needed assistance after he twisted his left knee out of place before a long flight at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. But the US Navy bomb specialist could not pop the artificial knee joint back into place on his own because the special wrench he needed was in his checked luggage. Scroll down for video . Airport mechanic Keith Duffner, left, adjusts Taylor Morris' artificial knee after it became twisted . Facing an eight-hour journey that would become even more challenging with a wobbly left leg, Mr Morris and his long-time girlfriend, Danielle Kelly, set out to find an airport employee who could help, but they were unable to find someone with the right tool. With time running out and a fix looking unlikely, word eventually reached Keith Duffner, the lead mechanic for American Airlines and US Airways at the Nevada airport. By then, Morris and Kelly were already on the phone looking for someone who could bring a metric Allen wrench to the airport before their flight departed. Duffner found the pair and went through his tools, finding a similar style wrench that allowed them to pop off the crooked knee and put it back in place. A photo of the moment has been circulating online, with Duffner drawing praise from strangers and the couple for helping out. On her blog, Kelly wrote: ‘By the luck of all that is holy, one of the standard Allen wrenches worked!! ‘It wasn’t perfect but it was about 90 per cent better, which allowed for a much smoother travelling day.’ War hero: Thousands of people have been inspired by Taylor Morris' recovery from devastating injuries . In a post on the airport’s Facebook page, the humble mechanic said: ‘Normally we just fix airplanes and don’t interface with passengers. Occasionally we provide tape or glue for an interim repair, or retrieve a lost item that someone has dropped out of reach. ‘What I did wasn’t much, and we all are in his debt to him and his family for sacrificing in service to us.’ Thousands of people have been inspired by Morris’ recovery through Kelly’s blog posts, home videos posted on YouTube and social media updates. The world fell in love with the high schools sweethearts, from Cedar Falls, Iowa, after a video showed them dancing at a friend’s wedding just five months after he was injured in action. Morris, an explosive ordinance device technician, lost both of his legs, his left arm and his right hand when he stepped on an improvised explosive device while serving in Afghanistan in May 2012. Despite suffering horrific injuries, he maintained consciousness and relayed information to his team leaders, earning him the Bronze Star with valour.","Taylor Morris lost his legs, left arm and right hand when he stepped on IED .

"Earl of Cardigan, pictured leaving court yesterday, is currently claiming benefits but has looked for work as a lorry driver, according to his mother . The Earl of Cardigan, whose privileged background provides him with a title, stately home and a 4,000-acre country estate, has tried to become a lorry driver, according to his mother. The 60-year-old earl, full name David Michael James Brudenell-Bruce, is currently looking for work and his search has included driving lorries. The aristocrat was recently revealed to be receiving around £71 per week in Jobseeker's Allowance. His mother, Edwina Bonn, 79, said yesterday she had been in tears over the 'witch-hunt' against her son. Although she said she did not know her son was claiming benefits, she said she was pleased he was looking for work. Mrs Bonn said: 'It is rather a good thing he is trying to get a job. 'I know a bit about him trying to become a lorry driver.' It emerged he was claiming benefits at his latest court appearance over a long-running feud with estate trustees. The earl had been due to stand trial after denying damaging six pheasant feeders worth £66 and the theft of a battery and electrical power unit worth £80 at his Savernake Estate, near Marlborough, Wiltshire. The troubled aristocrat claims to live there with rain coming in through the roof, no hot water, unsafe electrics and with heating confined to a single room after falling out with trustees in 2007 resulting in a reduced income. The Old Etonian claims he must visit the public baths in Marlborough to take a hot shower and goes to bed fully clothed wearing a hat to keep warm. The descendant of the man who led the Charge of the Light Brigade, the earl is at loggerheads with the trustees of his country pile. He took one of them, his former friend John Moore, to the High Court accusing him of selling family portraits without his permission, but lost the case. Their continued dispute, said to date back to 2007, has left him broke, he says. Yesterday at Swindon Crown Court he was bound over in the sum of £200 to keep the peace – meaning the prosecution will probably drop all charges if he causes no trouble for a year. Mrs Bonn, who divorced the earl's . father the Marquis of Ailsbury in 1961, said: 'I hope he succeeds in . getting rid of John Moore. 'There has been a witch-hunt against David by the Trustees. 'What a waste of court time over all such petty stuff.' Lord Cardigan, pictured with wife Joanne outside Tottenham House, part of his huge Savernake Estate, near Marlborough, receives about £71 a week in Job Seekers' Allowance . Former Viscountess Savernake, Edwina Sylvia Bonn, pictured left in 1960, said her son David, the Earl of Cardigan, centre aged nine, was nto to blame for what has happened . Old Etonian David Brudenell-Bruce is . descendant of the 7th Earl who famously led the disastrous British . cavalry charge of the 600 in 1854 against the Russians in the Crimean . War. Their title goes back . to 1611 when James I created the Baronetage of England and offered . titles to 200 men to help with the settlement of Ireland. They have lived on the same estate in Wiltshire for 1,000 years. They rode 'into the jaws of Death, into the mouth of Hell', wrote Tennyson in his poem commemorating the suicidal attack. An . appalling series of misunderstandings led to the Brigade advancing down . a different valley from the one commander-in-chief, Lord Raglan, had . intended when he dictated ambiguous orders for Lord Lucan, the cavalry . commander. Despite the . fact that the order seemed to demand the cavalry to attack the Russian . artillery without infantry support - in contravention of all accepted . laws of military practice - an incredulous Lucan passed the instructions . on to the Earl of Cardigan, who commanded the Light Brigade, and the . troops advanced. 664 men took part and 110 were left dead. She added: 'In recent months he has taken such a battering.' She said she was left in tears after her son was cleared of assaulting Mr Moore and criminal damage in a separate case last week. Speaking from her home in Scotland, Mrs Bonn said: 'I am so absolutely thrilled. I think it is rather . wonderful. I was in tears. I have had a message good news David has got . off. 'I keep in contact with him like any mother would - I have been in . contract with him all his life. I feel about his situation as any mother . would.' At court yesterday, Claire Marlow, prosecuting, said: . ‘These offences are generally of a nuisance and aimed at disrupting the . workings of the trustees and the estate.’ Mike Pulsford, defending, said the . earl was maintaining his innocence but agreed to be bound over, adding: . ‘There is a Chancery Court application by my client to remove the two . trustees from the Savernake Estate.’ Mr Pulsford told the court that the earl is unemployed and has been receiving Jobseeker’s Allowance. ‘He is not working. One of his claims against the trustees is that they have withheld certain monies from him,’ he said. Last week, the earl, whose daughter . Catherine is pop singer Bo Bruce, was acquitted by magistrates of . assaulting Mr Moore and criminal damage. Outside court yesterday, the earl, . who was accompanied by his second wife, Joanne, and her mother, said . this case was the 14th set of allegations made against him during his . long-running dispute. ‘Most of them have been dismissed by the police as . being too absurd. ‘The battery I am accused of stealing is still sitting at the bottom of my garden, exactly where it was when this case started. ‘This is the most stupid of many stupid charges the police and Crown Prosecution Service have brought against me. 'What would I want with a used car battery that doesn’t even fit in my car? 'The gamekeeper had removed all the good pheasant feeders and left only the broken ones. 'Those are the ones I was accused of breaking further.’ The earl said the proceedings in the Chancery Court were about removing Mr Moore, a barrister’s clerk, as a trustee. ‘I will not rest until I have removed him from his position. Even if it takes me the rest of my life, that man will go.’ Yesterday Mr Moore said: 'I am not prepared to talk about as it is sub judicee. 'The court case will be many many months away probably in the autumn or next year.' The Earl of Cardigan lost a legal battle this month with his trustees over the sale of ancestral portraits .

"'African-American lives matter': Tracy Martin, father of Trayvon Martin, spoke out against the stigma surrounding young black men on MSNBC last night . The father of Trayvon Martin, the boy shot dead in Florida in 2012, last night spoke out against the stereotypes that stigmatise young blacks in America. Speaking about the shooting of Michael Brown nine days ago at the hands of a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, Tracy Martin told MSNBC he recognised attempts to smear the dead teenager's name. Trayvon was just 17 when he was killed by neighbourhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder after his lawyers painted Trayvon as a dope-smoking, school-skipping delinquent. Speaking after police in Ferguson released footage of Brown allegedly robbing a liquor store, Mr Martin said: 'You ask yourself as a parent... is my son on trial or is his killer on trial?' 'I'm seeing the same elements in this case.' As he spoke, Mr Martin's face was etched with sadness despite insisting his family were 'doing well'. Asked by MSNBC's Alex Witt how a solution can by found to the 'alienation' felt by many in the black community, he said: 'We have to understand that as an African-American community our young kids get stereotyped a lot and we have to break the stigma. 'We have to come together as human beings and say that African-American lives matter as much as any other ethnicity group matters.' Mr Martin's comments were a sad reflection of the general opinion of many of the residents of Ferguson, a mainly black suburb of St Louis, who are increasingly asking questions about whether authorities leading the investigation into Brown's death can be trusted to make impartial findings. After a week-long crackdown on protests in the town, which have turned violent as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators, the Associated Press reports that grand jurors have begun hearing evidence to help them decide whether Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson is charged with a state crime for the August 9 killing. The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a separate civil rights investigation, which could mean there are two decisions about whether to charge Wilson, who is white. The state's case is being overseen by St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, who is white, and remains in charge despite mounting pressure to step aside. There are some among local residents and black St. Louis area officials who believe Mr McCullogh, who has strong links to police, cannot be impartial.

Representative Bobby Rush, taking off his jacket to wear a a hoodie and sunglasses as he speaks on the floor of the House on Capitol Hill in Washington, in March 28, 2012, to denounce racial profiling of black people . In some other prominent cases — including the killing of Trayvon Martin — special state prosecutors have been appointed to determine whether to pursue charges. That sometimes has occurred after the local authorities took no action. But under Missouri law, it 'would be highly, highly, highly unusual' for a prosecutor to step aside merely because of racial tensions in a high-profile case, said Peter Joy, a Washington University law professor who directs the school's Criminal Justice Clinic. That's because in Missouri, 'the buck stops with the head prosecutor' in each county. Missouri law allows two avenues for outside prosecutors. The local prosecutor can ask for help from the governor, who can appoint the state attorney general's office to the case, or a court can appoint a special prosecutor if the elected one has a conflict of interest. Police shootings don't automatically qualify as conflicts of interest and often are handled by local prosecutors. 'Just because the case is really hot and really controversial would not be a reason why I would seek a special prosecutor,' said Eric Zahnd, a Kansas City-area prosecutor who is a past president of the Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Michael Brown was unarmed when he was shot at least six times by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The killing has sparked more than a week of protests and claims of police institutionalised racism . Police say Brown failed to move out of the centre of the street when Wilson asked him to, and a scuffle ensued before he was shot. Witnesses say Brown had his hands up as Wilson fired multiple rounds. Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting and the department has refused to comment on his whereabouts. Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area. In the predominantly black suburb of Ferguson, where the shooting occurred, many residents say they have long been harassed and intimidated by the police department, which has just three black officers on its 53-member force. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police put the streets of Ferguson on lockdown, calling in reinforcements including armoured vehicles and stalking the streets toting shotguns and sniper rifles in military-style camouflage gear and body armour . The scene in Ferguson last night as protesters fled a volley of tear gas fired by police clearing the streets . Residents have been left furious by the heavy-handed response, and they also have no confidence in Mr McCulloch, who has been prosecutor since 1991. 'He's not going to prosecute the police officers,' said Robert Fowler, a 48-year-old electrician. 'In the ghetto ... every police officer, he's letting go free. They call it justifiable homicide.' Part of the scepticism stems from McCulloch's past. He comes from a family of police officers, and when McCulloch was a 12 years old, his father was fatally shot while responding to a call in 1964. Others point to a 2001 case, where McCulloch brought no charges against two officers who fired 21 shots into a vehicle, killing two black men during an attempted drug arrest. A spokesman for Mr McCullogh told The Associated Press the prosecutor has no plans to step aside from the Brown case. 'The people of this county have placed their trust in me,' Mr McCulloch told TV station KMOV. 'I've been as fair and impartial and done as thorough of a job as we could.' U.S. Representative William Lacy Clay Jr., St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley and state Senators Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Jamilah Nasheed — all of whom are black — have called on Mr McCulloch to consent to a special prosecutor. Ms Nasheed started an online petition and got more than 15,000 signatures within two days seeking a special prosecutor. 'In the past, justice has not been achieved in these types of police shootings,' said Mr Clay, who represents the area. 'So I have no comfort with local-authority prosecution, the judicial system or even police conducting a thorough and conclusive investigation that delivers justice to family of Michael Brown.' 'Simply put: he has a natural bias,' Ms Chappelle-Nadal, the local state senator, said of Mr McCulloch. 'My community doesn't trust him.' Missouri does have a recent case in which a special prosecutor took over a highly publicised case, although it was not a racially charged scenario. Last October, a prosecutor in rural northwest Missouri asked a judge to appoint a special prosecutor after public concerns that he didn't do enough before dropping felony charges against a teenage boy accused of sexually assaulting a younger girl. A judge appointed a Kansas City area prosecutor to take a new look at the case, and Matthew Barnett pleaded guilty in January to misdemeanor child endangerment.","Tracy Martin's son was 17 when he was shot dead by George Zimmerman .

"Slain U.S. journalist James Foley was living his faith by bringing images to the world of people suffering from war and oppressive regimes, a Roman Catholic bishop said Sunday at a Mass in his honor.

'It is in pardoning that we are pardoned. It is in dying that we are born to eternal life. To these words, I think we can say, `Yes, I wish we could do that.' It is not beyond our capability.

The world's largest bloc of Islamic nations also denounced Foley's 'heinous' killing and reiterated its support for international efforts to confront the Islamic State.

"A fascinating map of Twitter use over the U.S. shows how the story of Michael's Brown death and the subsequent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, spread from a local story to intense national scrutiny. The map was created by Twitter's data team, who used mentions of the city and related keywords to track the story's progress across America. The resulting map visualizes the story as tiny blips in the Midwest before becoming a serious of bright yellow explosions that almost cover the country. Scroll down for graphic . A Twitter data team has mined user mentions of Ferguson and Michael Brown to show how the midwest teen's tragic death went from local story to world news .

As the Atlantic's CityLab notes,the activity seems to spike immediately after local police arrested journalists Wesley Lowery and Ryan Reilly on Wednesday. Writing for CityLab, Kriston Capps observed: 'Judging by the procession of the progress bar, it's late-ish into Aug. 13 when Twitter goes nuclear, right around the time that the two . reporters were arrested.' Twitter mentions of Ferguson spiked as police and protestors clashed, especially following the arrest of several journalists . Graphic images like the Brown's lifeless body have been widely disseminated by Twitter users . And Huffington Post adds that Twitter's ability to influence ideas is no more evident than in the number of widely-adopted hashtags being used to transmit what are now considered the definitive images of the conflicts between demonstrators and local police.

In the same day, Brown was also identified as a suspect in a robbery, thought it was added that Wilson was unaware of Brown's possible connection to that crime when the two met.

"Chilling new details have emerged of the thrill killing of a young Australian man who was out jogging in Oklahoma in August. One of the teenagers who has confessed to a role in the fatal shooting of Christopher Lane, 22, who was in the US on a baseball scholarship, says he recalls the victim 'screaming' as he was shot. Three Duncan teenagers were charged in the August 16 shooting of Lane, who was out jogging along a street when he was hit in the back by a bullet. Killed: Christopher Lane, a baseball player and student, was 'screaming' after he was shot while jogging, according to one of the teenagers accused of his murder . Suspects: Michael Jones (left) is accused of being an accessory to murder while Chancey Luna (center) and James Edwards (right) face first degree murder charges for the shooting of Christopher Lane . Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards Jr., 16, were charged with first-degree murder. Michael . Dewayne Jones, 17, was charged with accessory to first-degree murder . after the fact and use of a vehicle in discharge of a weapon. In an August 18 interview, Jones admitted he was driving. ‘Jones . advised that Chancey Luna had fired the shot that struck Christopher . Lane and that Jones heard Christopher Lane scream as the shot was . fired,’ an investigator wrote in court papers, according to the Oklahoman. Police said Jones told investigators that the three were 'bored' and decided to kill someone for the 'fun of it'. Questionable: Friends claimed Edwards (center) and Luna (right) were trying to join the local chapter . of the notorious Crips gang, and they posted pictures to their Facebook . where they are holding gang signs . Heartbroken: Sarah Harper is devasted by her boyfriend Lane's (right) murder during a drive by shooting when he was jogging near her house . The . district attorney investigator, Justin Scott, revealed the new detail . in several requests made last month to a judge for permission to do . searches for evidence. The . investigator also reported to the judge that Jones claimed he concealed . the gun several minutes after the shooting in a factory compartment . under the hood of his Ford Focus. Lane, a student at East Central University, was killed by a single bullet that hit his back and penetrated both of his lungs and his pulmonary artery, an autopsy has revealed. The . state medical examiner's report said . Lane suffered a single bullet wound, which authorities said came from a . .22-caliber revolver. The man who tried to save Chris Lane's life has told how he and two passers-by were there when he took his final gasps of air. Richard . Rhodes, a contractor, and his partner Lindsey Moore were working on a . nearby house when they heard what they thought to be a gunshot. They . ran out to the street and saw the black Ford Focus driving away, but . they didn't begin to understand what happened until they saw a woman . bent over a ditch. At first they thought the woman, later . identified as Joyce Smith, had blown a tire of her car but then they . saw that she was leaning over the body of the Australian student who had . just been out for a jog. 'I was like this, telling him, ""buddy, stay with us, stay with us,""' Mr Rhodes told the Sydney Morning Herald. Ms . Smith was the woman who called 911 and the recording that was released . shows that she was frantically telling the emergency operator to get . responders to the scene as soon as possible. It . is clear from the recording that she was talking to other people at the . scene, and they were the ones to realise that he had been shot. Lane was lying in a ditch off the side . of the road, and as Mr Rhodes leaned over his body he saw blood coming . out of the 22-year-olds mouth. As he lifted up Lane's t-shirt, he saw there was a small gunshot wound in the upper left portion of his back. Remembered: Bob Gregg, a professor in the religion department at Oklahoma Christian University, bows his head as he leads the audience in prayer during the memorial service for Lane after he was shot . Support: Friends Jordan Corn, left, and Sam Moon embrace before the memorial service for Lane . It emerged that the day before . Edwards is alleged to have shot dead Lane in a drive-by from . a black Ford Focus, he tweeted about rapper Chief Keef. Two . days earlier he posted a chilling tweet that was a lyric from the . rapper's song I Don't Like. It read: 'With my n****s when it's time to . start taken life's' (sic). Other lyrics in the same song include 'pistol . toting and I'm shooting on sight'. Tough guy: Edwards posted videos of him tossing . around guns and looking threatening in a blue bandana associated with . the notorious Crips gang . Victim: Chris Lane (left) was shot when he was jogging during a visit to his girlfriend Sarah Harper's (right) family home in Duncan, Oklahoma . The boys also posted pictures of . themselves doing gang signs with their hands, pretending to use wads of . cash as telephones and posing with guns in social media videos. Senseless: Christopher Lane, 22, was on a baseball scholarship from Australia when he was randomly shot . Edwards . also changed his profile picture on August 9 to show his face hidden in . a blue bandana - typically associated with the Crips and its affiliates . - and they are active in Oklahoma. Four Crips were indicted on drugs . charges in Tulsa in June. But . Detective John Byers, who is leading the investigation and is the . town's gang expert, told MailOnline: 'Jones, the white gentleman, I've . not known him to be claiming to be part of any gang. 'On . Edward's posts he is throwing up hand signs, but I haven't known him to . say he's part of any gang - and we have no knowledge of Luna being . involved with the other two before at all. 'I . cannot say this is a gang. They knew each other, they hung out. they . committed crime. Yes, by classification, to be called a gang, they have . to have some kind of initiation and call themselves a certain name, but . at this point I can't say they are a gang. 'Social media has played a large part of this investigation.' Officials believe that Lane was not their first target, though he was their first human victim. Police . chief Ford said that during their investigation they found a dead . donkey that had been killed with a shotgun just a block away from where . Lane was murdered. Shock: Residents of Duncan have been moved by the murder that attracted worldwide attention . The small town has been rocked by the . senseless murder that has sent shockwaves around the world, leaving many . wondering what drove the 'bored' boys to apparently kill just for the . thrill of it. Because . of Lane's nationality, the case has gained national attention, but some . have criticized the White House for not reacting strongly enough. A . State Department spokeswoman put out a statement last week saying that . the federal government is 'deeply saddened' by Lane's death but she did . not comment on any specific action. Australia's . former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called for his fellow . countrymen to think of this shooting when they are planning a trip to . the United States.","Christopher Lane was shot in the back as he jogged in Duncan, Oklahoma, in August .

"The mother of a transgender wife who was murdered then dismembered by her husband says she forgives her daughter's killer. The remains of Mayang Prasetyo were found cooking inside a Teneriffe apartment - in Brisbane's inner-city - on Saturday night. Her husband, Marcus Volke, fled the scene when police showed up at the couple's home and was later found with his throat slashed and a knife in an industrial bin nearby. Scroll down for video . Friends have revealed Marcus Volke (pictured here with Mayang Prasetyo) was a male prostitute, not a chef as previously reported . The mother of Ms Prasetyo says she has forgiven Volke for the murder of her daughter . Mayang Prasetyo was found dismembered in a Brisbane apartment she shared with her husband on Saturday . It has been revealed Volke was a male prostitute and covered up his secret life by telling close friends and family he was a chef. Speaking through an interpreter, Nining Sukarni - the mother of Ms Prasetyo - said on Wednesday she had already forgiven her son-in-law. 'I have forgiven. I have no demands whatsoever or revengeful feeling. Because I love Marcus just like I love Maya,' she told The Courier Mail. Ms Sukarni said she had met Volke when the couple came to visit her at her Lampung home in rural Indonesia in 2013. 'They loved each other. We have already considered him as part of the family. I love him,' she said . Ms Sukarni described Ms Prasetyo - who her mother refers to as  Febri Andriansyah - as 'cheerful, friendly and loud' and a 'good son'. She said when they came to visit in August last year Volke had cooked with Ms Prasetyo and the visit passed without incident. 'He was kind and loving, shy and reserved. In our eyes he was kind. I never suspected anything,' Ms Surkarni said. Parts of Ms Prasetyo's body were found strewn across the couple's new Teneriffe apartment . Volke worked under the name of Heath and advertised on online escorting sites . The 27-year-old was known as Febri Andriansyah, according to her Indonesian passport . But Kaisey Bloom - a long-term friend of the transgender escort - paints a very different picture of the couple's life together, saying Volke was a bully and shamed his wife. Ms Bloom told The Courier Mail Ms Prasetyo was abused by her husband - not just physically but mentally as well. 'She told me he would get really nasty and would often bring up her past gender disclosure and use it against her,' she said. These revelations come after friends of the couple revealed the truth about Marcus Volke's double life to Daily Mail Australia and also criticised a Brisbane newspaper for its portrayal of victim Mayang Prasetyo. Interior designer Alex Devantier, who knew the couple well, told Daily Mail Australia Volke had never worked as a chef but used it as a cover story to avoid telling his family and close friends the truth about his life as Heath the male prostitute. Ms Prasetyo, 27, was described as 'happy, cheerful person' and an 'angel' by friends. Mr Devantier said that the front page headline featuring the term 'shemale' was extremely offensive to both her and the transgender community. He asked The Courier Mail to donate profits from Tuesday's edition to the Gender Centre - a not-for-profit which raises awareness of transgender issues - and Ms Prasetyo's family. Media outlets have previously reported the 28-year-old was a chef and had met Ms Prasetyo on an international cruise ship . He worked under the name Heath and was registered as a private escort in Melbourne . It comes as Queensland detectives appealed for friends and associates of the couple to come forward as police continue their investigation into the murder-suicide. 'We would like to make an appeal for anyone who may have known the couple – either individually or together, to contact police,' Detective Senior Sergeant Tom Armitt said. 'As part of our investigation, we would like to speak to either close friends or other associates of the pair – we would like to know the nature of their relationship with the couple, and gather information about how the couple interacted. 'This information is important in order to present a background about the pair's relationship and its dynamic to the Queensland Coroner.' It has also been revealed Ms Prasetyo travelled as a man named Febri Andriansyah on an Indonesian passport. Media outlets  have previously reported Volke was a chef who met Ms Prasetyo on an international cruise ship. 'They were leading double lives because of the lives they were leading,' Mr Devantier said. 'Marcus wouldn't even tell his closest friends of the life he was leading. 'They lied to their families, so their families didn't realise what they were actually doing.' In an online advertisement under the name Heath XL, Volke describes himself as a 'young sexy Australian boy, very friendly and easy going'. The ad went onto to say: 'I can be your companion for an hour or as long as u want, for a dinner, a hot session, holidays or more'. Queensland Police removed a toxic-labelled container on Monday, following the discovery of Ms Prasetyo's body parts found boiling in chemicals in a Brisbane apartment on Saturday night . Emergency services remove her body from the DoubleOne 3 Apartments in Commercial Road . Queensland Police made the grisly discovery of a woman's body parts just after 9pm on Saturday night . Mr Devantier met Volke and Ms Prasetyo - who were married in Europe in August 2013 - four years ago in Melbourne and introduced them. He said the pair worked at Melbourne brothel Pleasure Dome in 2009 and were employed there as escorts for about two months. 'Mayang left the agency because she was so popular that all the other transsexuals hated her and that's why she asked me to build her own website to get away from those who were jealous of her achievements,' Mr Devantier said. 'They both went into private escorting. I actually helped Marcus register as a private escort in Melbourne and then with his advertising.' Mr Devantier, from Townsville, said he was in shock over the tragedy. 'I still don't believe he [Volke] did it. I can't believe he did it. If he did do it, sometimes you can't judge it, you can't pick it,' Mr Devantier said. 'They were a loving and beautiful couple, and never a bad word from either of them about each other. 'I looked after Mayang's escort website and I was in communication with her all the time. 'There was never any hostility towards each other.' The grisly death is being treated as a murder-suicide after Volke fled the scene and was later found in an industrial bin with his throat cut . Ms Prasetyo's remains were found at an apartment on Commercial Road and Volke's body was found on Dath Street . Mr Devantier and Ms Prasetyo's other friends have called on The Courier Mail to donate its profits from Tuesday's edition which labelled the transgender escort as a 'shemale'. When he saw the front page of the News Corp newspaper, Mr Devantier said he was disgusted. He has asked for the donation to be made to the Gender Centre, which helps raise awareness of transgender, issues and Ms Prasetyo's family back in Indonesia for her funeral costs. 'We need to make the community aware of the difference between a post-op and pre-op transgender person, a transvestite, a cross dresser, et cetera,' he said. '[Ms Prasetyo's] family have just lost their sole source of income and money for putting the family's second eldest and third eldest child – both girls - through high school and that was who she was to them, the breadwinner.' Mr Devantier also urged people to a sign a change.org petition asking for The Courier Mail to 'publicly apologise for articles relating to Mayang Prasetyo'. At the time of publication, the petition had amassed almost 25,000 signatures. Mr Devantier said Ms Prasetyo - who was a pre-operation transsexual  - was months away from becoming a woman anatomically. 'She said she knew from 10 years old that she believed she was a woman and I believe she was not far from her goal – it would have been months,' he said.","Nining Sukarni is the mother of transgender wife Mayang Prasetyo, 27 .

"Among the groups working to try and help keep the peace in under siege Ferguson, Missouri, are leather-clad motorcycle groups. The bikers include members from groups including Outcast MC - America's oldest all-black motorcycle club - and Dominant Breed.

Scroll down for video . Leather-clad motorcycle groups are working to try and help keep the peace in under siege Ferguson, Missouri . One rider told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch over the weekend that the clubs don't have a specific strategy to help protect the city. ‘But normally when they see our presence [troublemakers] don't come around much,’ he said. The bikers have also been spotted at a memorial site for the slain teen in recent days and their presence is widely considered to be having a positive impact. Protesters and local residents have shared photos on social media of the bikers, wearing their signature black jackets and skull masks. Riders have been helping to protect stores against looters as well as joining in peaceful rallies protesting the shooting of Michael Brown . Protesters and local residents in Ferguson have shared photos on social media of the bikers, wearing their signature black jackets and skull masks . Outcast MC was founded in Detroit in 1969 and has chapters around the country. The bikers aren't the only group on the streets of Ferguson working to restore order and support the peaceful protesters. Amnesty International and the Black Panther Party are among the other groups that currently have a presence in the town along with local student and church-based organizations. Funeral services for Brown, the black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer,  are planned for Monday. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Brown family said the exact time and location for the memorial has not been finalized. The shooting of the unarmed Brown by officer Darren Wilson has stoked more than a week of unrest in the city. Police have used tear gas, sound projectors and other means to turn back demonstrators, some of whom have lobbed Molotov cocktails and bottles at officers. The volatile scenes prompted Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to deploy the National Guard in an effort control the unrest.

The protests come about two weeks after a bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced an 844-page bill, backed by President Barack Obama, that would rewrite many of America's immigration laws. A centerpiece of the measure would create a path to legal status and ultimately citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. It also aims to secure the U.S. border with Mexico against illegal entry and to make it easier for industry, particularly high-tech businesses and agriculture, to hire workers from abroad when needed.

"A pregnant woman has been savaged by her own Staffordshire bull terrier-type dog which witnesses say left her  arm 'hanging by a thread'. The dog owner, believed to be in her 20s, sustained serious arm injuries after the daylight attack outside Whittington Barracks in Lichfield, Staffordshire at 4 pm on Thursday. After hearing her terrified screams, cadets at the barracks, who were training outside, scaled the 12 foot high perimeter fence to rush to the woman's aid. An air ambulance at the scene of where a pregnant woman was attacked by her own Staffordshire bull terrier type dog leaving her with serious arm injuries . With the help of army medics, they tended to her wounds before an air ambulance rushed the badly injured victim to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. The dog, said to be a mastiff or Staffordshire bull terrier cross, was captured by police shortly after the attack on Nottingham Road near to a nursery, who were told to keep the children indoors. The woman, who has not been named but lives near to the barracks, remains in hospital where she is being treated for horrific injuries to her arm. Today local residents said they had complained about the animal to the council on a number of occasions over fears it was out of control. One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'It is quite aggressive so there have been a number of complaints in the area about it being out of control and a danger to children as there's a nursery nearby. The pregnant woman was walking her pet near to Whittington Army Barracks, when it attacked her in broad daylight . 'She was walking around the base perimeter when the dog just went for her, there didn't seem to be a trigger. It just snapped. 'The dog is a mastiff or Staffordshire bull terrier cross. It's huge. Like a small horse. 'There was lots of blood, it was just horrendous.' While another witness added: 'It was horrible, the dog just went for the pregnant woman right in front of the barracks and across from a pre-school. On hearing the woman's terrified screams, cadets from the barracks scaled the fence to rush to her aid . 'I'm told police had the children stay inside the school afterwards just in case. 'I think the dog was a staffie and I heard her neighbours have complained about it a few times. 'When the woman screamed the soldiers were the first on the scene. 'A couple of them even climbed the wall to help, which has some nasty looking razor wire on top of it. 'They must have saved her life. She is only a small lady and would not have stood a chance. The soldiers managed to scare the dog away. 'Otherwise it would have just torn her to shreds.' It is believed that the pet that savaged the woman was a Staffordshire bull terrier-type dog (file picture) Meanwhile a member of staff at Whittington Pre-School and Day Nursery, near to where the attack happened, said: 'We got a phone call telling us to keep the children inside until they had caught the dog. 'All we know is that a woman was injured. 'The children were more interested in the air ambulance to be honest.' A spokeswoman from Staffordshire Police confirmed that officers and ambulance staff attended the scene on Thursday and that the dog was owned by the woman. She also confirmed that casualty was taken to hospital by air ambulance. A Ministry of Defence spokesman also added: 'Medics and cadets used their training and experience to aid a civilian outside the barracks and have been personally praised for their brave actions.'","Pregnant woman was walking her dog near to Whittington Barracks .

"When it comes to naming those in need of fat treatment the winner of Miss Universe England does not immediately spring to mind. Amy Willerton may not be the most likely candidate for having body issues, but the model has recently undergone a £600 fat-freezing treatment to tone her thighs to get in shape for her 2015 Calendar shoot. The I'm a Celeb star went on two month campaign to drop the weight gained due to eating carbs to train for London Marathon, in order to look toned and trim for her latest swim-wear shoot. Scroll down for video . Amy Willerton had put on weight while training for the marathon and so tried a fat freezing treatment to shift her unwanted cellulite . Her weight gain was noticeable after the Marathon, when the 23-year-old model was pictured wearing only some skimpy swimwear and long blonde hair extensions at the Chelsea Flower Show back in May. Amy revealed that she wasn't her usual svelte self because the carb heavy diet that her marathon trainer had put her on prior to the race had made her pile on some weight. 'Just a short while after I had run the marathon I was still not back to my usual figure when I did a swim-wear photo shoot at Chelsea Flower Show' said the 22-year-old. Amy had been left feeling insecure after she was called a 'whale' following her bikini shoot at the Chelsea Flower Show earlier this year . Amy says that it was the abuse on Twitter that motivated her to get back into shape . 'Bizarrely, I actually put weight on when I was training for the London marathon. I was carb-loading because I was burning so much energy in training but it didn't help my figure.' Amy says that she does not regret doing the race whatsoever but she was eager to shed some of the weight she had gained. 'I am really happy that I took part and raised a lot of money for the Chickenshed charity, but afterwards I needed to go back to what I know – eating healthy and regular gym sessions.' Amy was pictured standing in giant scallop shell was meant to recreate the classic Botticelli painting The Birth of Venus, but instead it received a barrage of abuse on Twitter with people calling her 'huge' and 'a whale'. Amy says that it was the harsh comments that left her motivated enough to get back to her slender self. The Lipoglaze works by 'freezing fat' causing cells to crystallise and die . 'I did a photo shoot at Chelsea Flower Show and I received some really nasty comments on twitter. I don't think I have ever had such negative criticism before, but I didn't let the twitter trolls bother me and in fact I used that criticism as motivation to get in even better shape and now I'm the best shape I've ever been in.' Although the model was hugely driven to lose the weight she admitted that a it was a fat-freezing process that gave her the helping hand she needed. 'I'd also heard about the Lipoglaze fat-freezing treatment from friends who told me it kills off fat cells. They said it had worked for them and that it was pain-free so I thought why not? 'I work out regularly but I sometimes find it hard to shift the weight off of my thighs so I thought it would be good to have a bit of extra help in spot reduction of fat in that area.' Debra Ronson of the LoveLite clinic (pictured) says that even the skinniest of girls can have trouble shifting that extra wobble . Amy had the treatment at LoveLite clinic in Harley Street a few weeks after Chelsea Flower Show. The 60-minute treatment was for her upper thighs and has been seen to reduce fat deposits by up to 59% in just one session. A protective gauze is placed on the body area which is then gently sucked into the treatment head which then slightly heats the skin for five minutes before slowly reducing the skin temperature to minus 2C. At this temperature fat cells crystallise and die, and then naturally waste away through the body's renal system over the next 6-8 weeks. Amy couldn't wait to see the results and took to Twitter to share her excitement. 'Was so worried about trying #Lipoglaze but it didn't hurt at all! Yay @LoveLiteUk awesome job can't wait to track the results x' Despite having been motivated to lose weight, Amy insists that she was in no way bullied into it and says she did it purely for her own benefit. 'I would NEVER try to lose weight because people told me I have to. It's all about how you feel in yourself - bullies should not dictate how you live.' Debra Robson, director of the LoveLite clinic in Harley Street, says that even the skinniest of models can sometimes have a little cellulite that can't be shifted. 'Even super fit girls like Amy have that little bit of fat that just won't budge, regardless of how much exercise they do.' 'That's where Lipoglaze comes in – it destroys those stubborn fat cells that would otherwise have taken years of hard work to break down.'","Amy Willerton gained weight while training for the London Marathon .

The local police chief says the officer in question has been suspended with pay pending an investigation .

Schellman said the crowd was under control by about 5 p.m. and several of the additional officers had left the area. Gaskin said the angry crowd was reacting to a 'trauma.' 'Anytime you have this type of event that's taken place, emotions are going to run high,' he said. 'But for 600 people to gather around an area to see where a man is lying in the street, that means something happened that should have not happened.'

"Not long ago, I was hurtling along a narrow aisle of a large department store, on an errand that I didn't really have time for, very late, harassed, hot, sweaty, grumpy and most definitely unkempt, and I saw a middle-aged woman running towards me. I noticed as she came nearer that she looked a bit like a demented crone; she was small and haggard, had a gaunt face and lines around her eyes, and on her face was an anxious expression. Her hair needed washing. I think her shirt was wrongly buttoned. She was obviously in a hurry and in a state. Surprise reflection: Nicci doesn't feel like a 56-year-old woman . I put up a hand in apology and she put her hand up as well - and I realised that she was me. I was looking at myself in a mirror. I was that demented crone. I was stopped in my tracks. So this was how I looked to strangers when I was running through a department store on an errand: not slim and poised and purposeful but scrawny, worried and slightly unhinged. It was a grim and hilarious revelation. How many of us look in the mirror and think: but that's not me, not the real me, the one I carry round inside myself. I'm 56 now, and all my children are in their 20s; polite young men sometimes stand up for me on buses or offer to help me carry my fold-up bike up escalators. I need glasses for reading and have a nasty suspicion my hearing's getting worse; I have lines round my eyes and fillings in my mouth and stretch marks on my stomach and when I examine myself I think, how on earth did that happen? Where did I go, the self I used to be? As she was: Nicci still feels like the young mother of tiny children . There is always a gap between how we feel inside ourselves and how the world sees us. Sometimes this gap is comfortingly narrow and seems bridgeable; at other times it yawns horribly, so that the self we experience and the one that other people encounter appear almost unconnected. I think that this bewildering and often frightening mismatch between the way we see and know ourselves and the way the world sees us happens more often and more powerfully as we get older - because, of course, inside our minds and our hearts and our heads, we are still young, still just getting going on life's journey, still making up our minds who we want to be. Because, of course, I'm not really 56. I’m ten and jumping in puddles in my red wellington boots; I’m 15 and falling in love for the first time; I’m 18 and leaving home; I'm a student, a newly-wed, an over-eager young employee, a mother of tiny children, of not so tiny children... But the mirror ignores the selves I carry with me and can only, mercilessly, show me my 56-year-old self, unmistakably bashed about by life and all its ambushes. And people can only see that 56-year-old - or increasingly, perhaps, don’t see her. Or, when they meet my mother, they can only see a woman in her 80s, registered blind, who has had cancer and multiple strokes and is frail, precarious. They see her age and they admire her for her tenacity. 'Isn't she marvellous?' they say. And she is marvellous, a marvel, but not just because she is old and indomitable but because she is a passionate and fiercely optimistic woman. If you asked her how old she felt, she would probably say 21. She is 82 years young and she still feels that life is ahead of her. Both grown up: Nicci wonders where the young woman and her baby have gone . Today: The author feels she's judge more by her age now than her personality . It is because of my mother and women like her that I wrote my novel, The Twilight Hour, which is both the story of 94-year-old Eleanor, whose future is very short and whose secret past is long, and also the story of the young and beautiful Eleanor, full of hopes and desires. I wanted to hold both these women together and show how the old Eleanor is also the radiant young one. For as we age we become increasingly invisible, except as a category. And for the old, this category is becoming larger all the time. A few decades ago, it was rare to reach your late 80s or 90s and those who did were valued: they had lived so long and seen so much, lived through depressions and wars. Now it is common. Old people are talked about as a large and problematic group, a burden on the NHS, taking up hospital beds, increasingly expensive and time-consuming as they reach the last years of the journey they are on. Sometimes the words we use to describe them are insulting and patronising ('sweet', 'difficult', 'naughty'), as if being old made them children once more. A couple of years ago, one of my daughters was taken to hospital with a minor head injury: she had fallen off a horse, was briefly unconscious, and when she came round she not only had no memory of what had happened, but also could not form new memories. Four out of ten UK bosses perceive staff as old when their employees pass the age of 50 . For a few hours (after which she recovered entirely), whatever we told her she promptly forgot, greeting the news with an identical expression of incredulity. She was caught in a small loop of time, which was remarkably similar to how people are with severe dementia. She was kept in overnight for observation, and because there were few beds available, she was taken to an orthopaedic ward where everyone happened to be very old, and where all but one had some kind of dementia. It was night time; the lighting was dim, and all round us were shadowy shapes of women in states of distress and confusion. One kept crying out, like a child wanting its parents, and another was loudly and obscenely rude to the nurses. To my shame, I felt scared. The nurses were kind and respectful to their patients, but the room seemed full of pain and even a kind of torment. The next morning, with daylight making everything seem saner and less threatening, I saw it differently. The women were sitting up in bed. They talked, smiled. One was reading a book. Nicci wants people to be defined by who they are, not by how old they are . They were fellow humans, individuals, women with long and richly complicated histories who needed to be recognised and cherished for all the selves they held inside them. We all need to be recognised. To become invisible is to be like a ghost in our own life. We are our life's work and only at the very end can we gather together all these selves and know what we have made of ourselves. A few years ago, I trained to be a humanist celebrant: I conduct funerals for people who have no religious faith. I did it just as my children were leaving home and I had a powerful sense of a long chapter of my life being over. I became preoccupied with leavings and farewells. How do you say goodbye to someone you dearly love and will never see again, and how do you find comfort? You find comfort through memory. At a good funeral, the story is over and a life is pieced together. The body in the coffin was a daughter, a sister, a mother, a grandmother, a colleague, a lover, a friend. She was happy and she was sad; difficult and wonderful; loved and rejected. Now she is all these things. She is no longer old, nor is she young; she has become everything that she ever was. I once conducted a funeral for a woman who'd had a rackety kind of life - she had married several times, had been a model and a waitress, lived in several countries, been restless. She'd loved parties, adventures, excitement. There were only three at the service, including her carer. The empty chapel echoed with the dance music she had wanted. But at most services there is a sense of a whole life being lit up by accumulated memories. The coffin lies on the catafalque, but in the order of service there are often photographs: here is the dead person in a field of bluebells, here she is on her wedding day, or cradling her first baby. Day by day, we make up a life. Several times, I have visited the person whose funeral I will conduct before they die. Close to the end, they want to meet the person who is to bury them. I think, too, they want to tell the story of their life to a stranger who could acknowledge its uniqueness. This need to be seen whole and special is inside us all. If we are lucky, we become old. But when we are old, we still have that need to be recognised, seen as who we are. Our selves.

"A homeless family say they have been forced to live in their car with their pet dog, cats and cockatiel for three months after their home was repossessed. Deborah Talbot, 41, has been living in the disabled people carrier with her taxi driver partner Glyn Jones, 60, their 23-year-old daughter Rachel and their four pets since July because they say they have nowhere else to go. Their home in Newport, south Wales was repossesed by the bank after Ms Talbot lost her full-time job working in a supermarket. Scroll down for video . Deborah Talbot, with her partner Glyn and their daughter Rachel along with their two cats Cassey and Macey, their dog Fred and cockatiel Samuel. The family and their pets have been living in their car for three months . Each night the family cram into the car, which taxi driver Mr Jones uses for work since their home was repossessed after Ms Talbot lost her full-time job in a supermarket . Now she says she has had little luck so far in finding accommodation and have been forced to live in the car as they have no friends or family able to take them in. Ms Talbot, who now works part-time as a cleaner in a school, said: 'I got evicted by our mortgage company. Newport Council said we weren't a priority, and we weren't allowed to get emergency accommodation because we didn't have any children. 'We has nowhere to go at the time, which meant we ended up in there.' At night, the family all squeeze into the car loaned to them by the taxi firm Mr Jones works for along with their cats Cassy and Macey, a bird called Samuel and a dog called Fred. They also have to rely on takeaways and ready-to-eat food as they have no access to a kitchen. Ms Talbot explained that at night the cats go in the back of the car in a basket, while the cockatiel stays in a cage and the family use sleeping bags. The family say that they park up at random places where they can get some quiet but are worried about how to keep warm as the cold weather sets in . They have been using the facilities at Newport Centre for washing and have been keeping their bedding in the lockers there. While Mr Jones is working driving his taxi during the day, Ms Talbot says she and her daughter walk around the city waiting for him to finish. Meanwhile friends have helped out taking in the pets during the day, but the family say they come back to them overnight. Ms Talbot added: 'The chairs can't go down far because we need to make to to ensure we can all get in their to lie down properly. 'It has been quite uncomfortable. We park up at random places where we can get some quiet. 'It has been very cold.' The family say that they have approached private landlords to try to find accommodation but they are unable to scrape together the money for a bond . We've approached private landlords but we have had no joy - it's all about finding a bond. We haven't got the cash coming in to do that as well. 'I have bid on properties from Newport City Homes (a local registered social landlord) but nothing has come of it.' However, the family are hopeful they will get alternative accommodation soon after arranging a viewing on a property. A Newport council spokeswoman said: 'Ms Talbot applied under the homeless provisions in July after her home was repossessed. Her application was assessed correctly and a decision letter was issued on 17 July that accepted she was homeless but not in priority need. There is a right of appeal but this was not requested. 'Advice has been provided to Ms Talbot on numerous occasions including about housing benefit and options for alternative accommodation. We will continue to offer her advice and support as she seeks rehousing.

"Michael Brown was unarmed when he was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 . An elementary school teacher has been suspended after a Facebook post alleged that she instructed the students to re-enact the shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri. The Brantley Elementary School teacher, who has not been named, allegedly made 11 and 12-year-old white students play police officers and research the death of Mike Brown - who was shot dead on August 9, sparking race riots. Jessica Baughn, the mother of sixth grader Jimmy Griffin, who attends the school in Selma, Alabama, posted the complaint on Facebook on Tuesday. She wrote: 'I am absolutely shocked by what my 6th grade child come home telling me that [sic] happened in school (Brantley Elementary). 'His teacher made them reenact the two current shooting of the young black male's [sic]. 'The white students had to play the police officer. She even has them get on the internet and research how many times the young man was shot where [and] he was shot at.' Speaking to the Selma Times-Journal, Ms Baughn added: 'I don't think that it needs to be talked about at school at all, let alone reenacted. 'It scares me as a parent, because any one of those children could have picked up their aunt, uncle, grandma or whoever's gun and pointed it at another child and it went off accidentally.' Dallas County Schools superintendent of education Don Willingham said an instructor was teaching about current affairs when someone mentioned the shooting in Ferguson. He said the class conducted a 'skit' about the shooting, but declined to give further details of what happened or who suggested doing it. Mr Willingham said he had since interviewed the school's principal, Audrey Larkin Strong, the teacher involved, Ms Baughn and her son. Mr Willingham refused to identify the teacher involved until further interviews could be conducted, but has put the individual on paid leave. 'We wish the conversation didn't have to take place, but it's been reported to us and we're addressing it as quick as we can,' Mr Willingham said.

'I did put the teacher on administrative leave with pay, because we wanted to do the investigation. It's standard procedure.' Mr Willingham said he would continue interview those involved again, as well as students who were present in the classroom. Mr Strong said the school did not teach violence to children. He said: 'Brantley's culture does not support division. 'We do recognize diversity, but we do not support division. Our culture is a strong culture.'

"A grand jury has declined to indict a North Carolina police officer who killed an unarmed former Florida A&M football player by shooting him ten times last year. Officer Randall Kerrick, 28, was charged with voluntary manslaughter in the September 14 fatal shooting of 24-year-old Jonathan Ferrell in Charlotte. Ferrell’s family claim that he was in a submissive position – either on his knees or lying on the ground – when he was shot, and filed a wrongful death suit against Kerrick last week. An attorney for the family said the were 'disappointed, shocked, devastated' by the decision, as reported by WBTV. Controversy: Unarmed Jonathan Ferrell (left) was killed in Charlotte last year after being shot ten times by police officer Randall Kerrick. On Tuesday a grand jury declined to indict Kerrick for voluntary manslaughter . Fatal: Ferrell apparently walked about a half-mile to the nearest house at the upscale Bradfield Farm community and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention. Ferrell had survived a car accident and banged on the door of a nearby house in the middle of the night looking for help. On Tuesday the grand jury decided not to indict Officer Kerrick on the charge and asked the prosecutor to submit a lesser charge. But . the state Attorney General's office issued a statement later in the day . saying it would resubmit the case to a full grand jury after learning . that the panel that heard the case was less than a full panel. It isn't yet known whether the attorney general would again seek voluntary manslaughter or a lesser charge. It's also unclear why the grand jury took their decision without their full 18 members. NBC News . reported that the Mecklenburg County grand jurors submitted a . handwritten note saying that there wasn't enough evidence to indict . Kerrick on the original charge. Kerrick's attorney, George Laughrun, said the officer felt like 'the weight of the world has been lifted from his shoulders.' Wrongful death: Ferrell's family filed a lawsuit two weeks ago. Attorney Charles Monnett (left) speaks, his as mother Georgia Ferrell (center), brother Willie Ferrell (standing) and attorney Chris Chestnut (right) look on during a news conference on January 14 . Sadness: A memorial sits at the site of Jonathan Ferrell's death in Charlotte . 'He's extremely relieved that the grand jury members saw fit to keep an open mind and not listen to all the propaganda on all the things he did wrong,' Laughrun continued, as reported by the Charlotte Observer. Chris Chestnut, the family's attorney, told the newspaper that the grand jury's decision was 'highly suspicious and gravely concerning.' The attorney said that the Ferrell family have been left out of the process throughout the investigation. 'There has been nothing to demonstrate that this case has gotten the attention it deserves and needs for the citizens of Charlotte and America,' Chestnut said. 'It's that important a case. This feels like they don't value Jonathan's life.' Charlotte NAACP President Kojo Natambu told WBTV: 'This is one of the most despicable decisions I have ever seen made by human beings.' The wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Ferrell family also alleged that despite him . lying mortally wounded on the ground officers still deemed it necessary . to handcuff him, according to NBC News. The deadly encounter unfolded in Charlotte at about 2.30 a.m. on Saturday September 14 after Mr Ferrell had apparently been in an automobile wreck. A crash so severe he would have had to climb out of the back window to escape. Football star: Jonathan Ferrell (center) is pictured alongside teammates of his Florida A&M University 'Rattlers' football team . Ferrell apparently walked about a half-mile to the nearest house at the upscale Bradfield Farm community and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention. Thinking it was her husband coming home late from work, the woman who lived there opened the door. When she saw Ferrell, she shut it and called police. The authorities subsequently released a tape of her 911 call. A sobbing woman can be heard pleading for police to ‘please hurry’ after telling a dispatcher that a man was breaking into her front door. ‘He’s still there yelling,’ the woman said as the 911 dispatcher told her officers were on their way. ‘He’s yelling. He’s yelling.’ The unidentified woman keeps repeating ‘Oh, my god! Oh, my god!’ throughout the call. She also told the 911 operator that she had a baby in a crib and didn't know what to do. ‘He’s in his bed. I don’t know what to do. I can’t believe I opened the door,’ she said. Later, she said the man was knocking on her door and ‘he's in my front yard yelling.’ When three officers arrived they claim that Ferrell ran towards them. One officer attempted to Taser Ferrell but that didn't work and investigators said Ferrell continued to run towards Officer Randall Kerrick who had his service weapon drawn. Officer Kerrick fired 12 shots at Ferrell, striking Ferrell ten times. CMPD said officers on the scene thought Ferrell was a threat, but Kerrick was the only one who drew his gun and fired. Tragic: Georgia Ferrell, mother of Jonathan Ferrell, holds a stuffed Winnie-the-Pooh bear as she arrives at a news conference in Charlotte on January 14 . Ferrell's family said the former Florida A&M University football player moved to Charlotte about a year ago to be with his fiancee and was working two jobs. He wanted to go back to school and eventually become an automotive engineer. Ferrell's mother said Kerrick had no business being a police officer if he couldn't react properly to a man who needed help. 'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said. His family painted a picture of a bright man with an 'infectious smile' who was always there for his brothers and sisters. 'He was a role model,' said his brother, Frank. 'He had so much love in his heart. And he was always concerned about his family.' 'He had dreams of being an automotive engineer. He wanted to design a car from the very last bolt to the interior,' his brother said. He said he didn't know where his brother was going that night, or why he got into the accident. But he said his brother had never been in trouble before.","North Carolina grand jury decline indict police officer Randall Kerrick who fatally shot unarmed Jonathan Ferrell ten times last September .

"Authorities say a white woman shot in the back of head with a pellet gun while walking through Central Park Saturday was the victim of a hate crime. The 36-year-old woman, who asked reporters to only call her 'Hannah,' said she was on her way out of the park at W. 60th St. and West Drive at about 12:05 a.m. when she encountered a group of young black people. She said she did not speak to the group - two men and three women in their late teens and early 20s - but after passing them felt a 'horrible pain' in the back of her head. Police have release surveillance footage of three young people believed to be involved in a hate crime assault on a white woman leaving Central Park . Police have also released a sketch of one member of the group that allegedly hurled a rock at the woman's head and yelled racial insults at her . 'My hand went up to my head, and there was blood gushing everywhere,' Hannah told the The Daily News. 'I turned around, and I said, ‘What are you doing? Why are you doing this to me? What's wrong with you people?’' She says they answered with racial epithets. 'F---- you, you f------ white b----,' she says one woman yelled at her. She claims that another man appeared from behind a tree to join the group. According to Hannah he screamed: 'All white people suck. F--- white people.' She said the youths left and she began to cry. 'I was starting to go into shock,” Hannah told  The Daily News. 'There was a lot of blood.' She was taken to Roosevelt Hospital after police and paramedics responded to the scene. The unidentified woman says she was walking out of Central Park and had not spoken to anyone when one of the young black people she passed assaulted her .

"The family of the Michael Brown, the African-American teenager shot dead by a cop in St Louis will carry out their own autopsy when they get his body, MailOnline can reveal. Relatives of Michael Brown said that they 'do not trust the authorities in our community' and wanted a second opinion on how he died. They also questioned whether or not the officer who shot Michael dead called in the incident - and claimed that he initially walked away from the scene. The move . is a damning indictment of the complete breakdown in relations between . Michael's family and the almost all white police force in Ferguson, a . suburb of St Louis, Missouri. Michael . died at the age of 18 when he was repeatedly shot by a cop as he walked . to his grandmother’s house unarmed and in broad daylight on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Trust: Michael's mother Lesley McSpadden with husband, Louis Head, during a rally at the St. Mark Family Church on Tuesday night. They will ask for a second autopsy once the police hand back the body . Transparency: Police have said the results of their preliminary autopsy show that Michael was shot multiple times - but did not reveal how many and where on his body . Demand: Eric Davis, (pictured with wife Cheryl) told MailOnline: 'We want our own answers. Michael came from a loving family and the depiction of him and everything that the police are trying to put on him is totally not true' The suburb suffered a third night of unrest following the killing on Tuesday as police in riot gear and armored trucks trained high-powered rifles on protestors after a rally led by Al Sharpton, who had arrived in the city to support the family. It also emerged that a police officer critically injured a masked man who was believed to be staging a robbery. The preliminary results of the official autopsy show Michael died as a result of gunshot wounds, according to the St Louis County Medical Examiner's office. The results did not disclose how many times Michael was hit and that will only be made public when the full report is released in four weeks. In an interview with MailOnline, Michael’s cousin Eric Davis said: 'We don’t have Michael’s body back yet. The police still have it but when we get it back we will arrange our own autopsy. 'We don’t trust the authorities in our community. We want our own answers. Michael came from a loving family and the depiction of him and everything that the police are trying to put on him is totally not true. 'For them to do this and not be transparent and not even give us the officer’s name.' He added: . 'We don't even know what his (the cop's) state of mind was. He could . have been on drugs but we don't know because it's been too long to find . out.' Michael’s . family, who are being represented by Benjamin Crump, the attorney for . Trayvon Martin's family, claim the case has been mishandled right from . the start when his dead body was left uncovered for five hours on the . street. Onlookers had posted pictures of his bloody corpse on Facebook and Instagram before it was finally covered up. Mr . Davis even claimed: 'Witnesses told us that the officer walked away . from the scene and then he came back and got in his car and drove off. Did he radio it in? Michael's body was left uncovered for five hours.' The most compelling witness to come forward so far has been Dorian Johnson, 22, who was with Michael on Saturday as he got shot. He has said that the cop told them to 'get the f***' on to the sidewalk' while they were walking along the road. The officer pulled his truck in front of them and blocked the road, Johnson told MSNBC. The cop then threw open the door which slammed closed again after bouncing off Michael. It was then that the officer grabbed Michael by the neck and an altercation ensued. Johnson claimed that Michael ran off and stopped, holding his hands up in surrender - but the cop shot him anyway. Rage: A demonstrator throws back a tear gas container on Tuesday after tactical officers worked to break up a group of protesters in Ferguson, Missouri on a third night of rioting . Lockdown: An armored truck trains lights and high-powered rifles on protesters on the third night of tense demonstrations . Mr Davis said: 'Michael’s flip flops were at one point on the street, his hat was 10ft further on, and 10ft past that was his body. You can clearly see he was making point of moving away from the officer.' Pastor Charles Ewing, Michael's uncle, also told MailOnline that people in the neighborhood were accustomed to walking on the road as the sidewalk was narrow, so when the officer saw them doing so it should have been nothing unusual. Ferguson is now at a tense standoff with the community demanding that the name of the officer be released. In an interview with CBS his mother Lesley McSpadden said that he should do the decent thing and come forward. She said: 'If he did something wrong, you know you did something wrong. 'You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'","Move is damning indictment of the breakdown in relations between Michael's family and the police force in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri .

"After a day-long lull in Britain’s gold rush on Friday, it appeared as if Team GB may have had its fill of Olympic glory. But yesterday morning at the rowing lake at Eton Dorney – the scene of so many gold-medal-winning triumphs for British oarsmen – the man they call ‘the Usain Bolt of the water’ had other ideas. On the final full day of competition at the Games, Britain’s ‘human hydrofoil’ Ed McKeever set the standard for another day of Team GB success by storming to gold in the 200m sprint kayak. Scroll down for video . Champion: Ed McKeever won the men's 200m kayak race to claim Team GB's 26th gold medal of London 2012 . Paddle power: Ed McKeever triumphs at Eton Dorney yesterday in the 200m sprint kayak . Crouched forward, arms whirring at the extraordinary rate of three strokes a second, the 28-year-old became the fifth Team GB hero to be crowned Olympic champion on this beautiful Berkshire lake. Happy couple: Ed McKeever, with his fiance, Anya Kuczaj, a PE teacher . The ‘Dorney roar’ from the 20,000-strong crowd thronging the banks drove on McKeever – who is due to marry next month – as he blasted  to the front of the world-class field of sprint kayakers, described as the sport’s equivalent of Ferraris. In winning Team GB’s 26th gold medal, McKeever becomes only the second Briton in history to win  the Olympic title in the sport after Tim Brabants took gold in Beijing four years ago. It put an end to a barren run on the lake for Britain’s flat-water paddlers, who struggled to repeat last week’s glorious successes enjoyed by the rowing squad which took gold in four events. ‘Crossing the line was fantastic,’ said McKeever, a trainee accountant, who unlike Bolt is no extrovert. ‘I’m just so happy to contribute to the medal table. I thought I might struggle because I was light and more affected by the strong wind. ‘But I got a clean start. It was just relief at the end, not elation. I was  so happy I could do it in front of the home crowd.’ McKeever burst into an early lead and then held on to finish in a time of 36.2 seconds. He splashed the water and punched the air in jubilation as he crossed the line. A stiff wind in his face meant he could not match his Olympic record time, which was more than second quicker, set in the heats. ‘I knew coming into this that I was ready,’ he said. ‘I just wanted to go out and do my best race. If I did that, I knew I would come away with something. To come away with gold is brilliant. Moment of glory: Great Britain's Ed McKeever punches the air after crossing the line first to win gold . Thumbs up: Gold medallist McKeever, who has been dubbed the 'Usain Bolt of the water', celebrates his win . ‘It was really painful down the last bit with that headwind. I was really just focused on the first two or three strokes, I wanted to nail those and hope the race sorted itself out and  it did. The crowd helped to cheer  me on. When they announced my name and I got a cheer, it made my hair stand on end.’ McKeever has previously laughed off comparisons with Bolt, but yesterday he said: ‘I have the gold medal to go with it now, so I am more willing to accept that tag-line.’ With Olympic glory secured, he can now focus on marrying his  fiancee, PE teacher Anya Kucjak. McKeever was a pupil at St Laurence comprehensive school in Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, when he joined his first canoe club at 12. Triumph: Ed McKeever dominated the race and crossed the line in 36.246 seconds . Five years later he took part in the Junior World Championships and by 19 he was part of the GB senior team. ‘It was one of those things – you do a few races and you realise you are quite good at it. Winning races is quite infectious,’ he said. He was training to compete in the 500m Olympic event when it was dropped in 2009 in favour of the 200m sprint. The shorter, more explosive race suited him and a year later he was the World and European Champion in the discipline. Since then he has finished on the podium in every international event he has raced in. Victory: McKeever won Britain's second canoe sprint Olympic gold, following Tim Brabant's triumph in 2008 .

"Two major U.S. air carriers are being at risk of hefty fines after their customers were stranded for seven hours as runways turned into a ski slope over the weekend. It was a nightmare near Hartford, Connecticut, as passengers on six JetBlue planes and one American Airline plane say they were stranded on the tarmac at Bradley International Airport for seven hours or more. They were being diverted from New York-area airports on Saturday - and the ordeal continued after they were let off and had to spend the night on beds and chairs in terminals. Scroll down for video . Blizzard: Passengers were left tired and angry after being kept on board a JetBlue flight at Bradley International Airport for seven hours. Snow had made conditions difficult . Under the so-called tarmac delay rules put in place last year, both airlines, could be slapped with a fine of $27,000 per passenger, MarketWatch reported, a whopping $18,900,000 for JetBlue alone. A passenger on one of the diverted . JetBlue planes says the crew ran out of snacks and bottled water for the . last few hours of the delay. ‘The toilets were backed up,’ said . Florida newspaper reporter Andrew Carter, who was traveling to cover the . Miami Dolphins against the New York Giants. ‘When you flushed, nothing . would happen.’ His plane took off from Fort . Lauderdale for Newark Liberty International at around 9am. After being . diverted to Hartford, the plane sat on the tarmac between around 1:30pm . and 9pm, he said. A JetBlue spokesman said six of its . planes, carrying a total of about 700 passengers, were diverted to . Hartford as a result of a ‘confluence of events’. These included equipment failures at . Newark and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport that . prevented planes from landing in low visibility. The JetBlue spokesman declined to . specify how long the planes sat on the tarmac at Bradley, but noted that . 17 other flights with different carriers were also diverted to the . airport. Frustrated: Passengers were left without food, water or working bathrooms and journalist Andrew Carter, pictured second row on right with his head turned, Tweeted his annoyance . Once the planes landed at Bradley, the . JetBlue spokesman said that intermittent power outages at the airport . made refuelling and deplaning difficult. Kate Hanni, of FlyersRights.org, said . she got calls and emails from passengers and worried family members . regarding at least four flights that were stranded on the tarmac for up . to 10 hours. 'The toilets were backed up. When you flushed, nothing . would happen' Andrew Carter . Brent Stanley and his wife were on one . of those planes, an American Airlines flight that had originally been . headed to JFK after taking off from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. After being diverted and landing in . Hartford at 2:30pm, Mr Stanley said passengers were given various . reasons for being held on the tarmac. These included the need to refuel and de-ice and the airport's limited capacity for handling international flights. He and his wife were eager to get back . home to their two young sons in Lake Zurich, Illinois. But they . realised they didn't have it as bad as the parents who had infants on . the plane. Fury vented: Mr Carter, a reporter with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel on the flight to cover a football game in New Jersey, kept his followers updated while on board . ‘There was a lady in front of us with . an 18-month-old daughter,’ Mr Stanley said. ‘Another woman came by to . borrow diapers because we couldn't get to our luggage.’ 'There was a lady in front of us with . an 18-month-old daughter. Another woman came by to . borrow diapers because we couldn't get to our luggage' Brent Stanley . After spending the night at the . airport, Mr Stanley was lucky to find two seats on Sunday on an . afternoon flight home to Chicago. But the headache is not over yet as . his luggage was headed to JFK because the Hartford airport crew wasn't . able to handle international luggage, Mr Stanley said. An American Airlines spokesman said the passengers weren't allowed off the plane by customs at the airport. In a recording obtained by LiveATC.net, the pilot on the JetBlue flight from Fort Lauderdale was forced to call for police back-up when passengers grew hostile. He said: 'I got a problem here on the airplane, I'm gonna need to have the cops on board. There's a cop car sitting in front of me right here right now. 'I need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane.' Passengers: Mr Carter, left, was exhausted after the ordeal, while a passenger who would only identify himself as Robert, right, said he was furious . Matt Shellenberger, who was on a . JetBlue flight from Boston to JFK, said his plane was diverted to . Bradley International and sat on the tarmac for seven hours. The crew picked up rubbish regularly and handed out water and snacks and ‘everyone held their cool,’ he said. But his frustrations grew with each status update - as the reasons for the delay kept changing as the hours passed. 'I got a problem here on the airplane, I'm gonna need to have the cops on board. There's a cop car sitting in front of me right here right now. I need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane' Pilot on Fort Lauderdale plane . Early on, passengers were told that . the plane was just being refuelled and would fly out soon, he said. Then . they were told it was being de-iced. Then there was an emergency on . another plane. ‘We were told we were the third plane . in line to get to the gate when we landed,’ he said. ‘Then we stayed on . the plane for seven hours.’ Mr Carter of the Sun Sentinel . newspaper in Florida, who was on another JetBlue flight, reported a . similar sequence of updates. 'Lady on board just broke down,' he tweeted at one point. 'Like that guy who cried in his cell at the beginning of Shawshank. Can someone sneak me in Rita Hayworth?' The saga continued long after . passengers were let off the plane. The power outages from storms in . Connecticut made booking hotel rooms difficult. As a result, many . passengers just slept at the airport, Mr Carter and Mr Shellenberger . said separately. Help required: Passengers on board dialled 911 after hours of being told they couldn't leave. Fire and police crews arrived . When they awoke, hundreds of passengers had to wait in line for hours just to figure out which flight they would be on. ‘That was most disappointing part,’ Mr Carter said. ‘It seemed like there was no plan when we got off the plane.’ In the morning, Mr Carter said he and . several other passengers rented a van to drive to New Jersey rather than . wait for the afternoon flight JetBlue had scheduled to Newark. It's not the first time JetBlue has had problems with tarmac delays. The New York-based airline also made . headlines in 2007 when snow and ice storms stranded its planes for . nearly 11 hours at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Such high-profile delays helped prompt . a regulation last year that fines airlines for holding domestic flights . on the tarmac for more than three hours. This year, the rule was extended to apply to international flights that are held on the tarmac for more than four hours. Still delays: Stranded passengers rested on cots at Bradley International Airport, a day after the snowstorm in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, forced them to stay on board the plane . However the Department of . Transportation often doesn't enforce the fines to their full extent . unless delays are extreme. Passengers also do not get a cut of the . fines. Low-cost carriers are more prone to . tarmac delays because letting passengers off planes can cost an airline a . lot of money, said Ms Hanni of FlyersRights.org. If a plane is diverted because of a . reason within the airline's control, such as a mechanical failure, . ticket contracts usually state that passengers will be reimbursed for . hotels, food and transportation. That means airlines do everything in . their power to keep passengers on board in hope that the plane will be . able to take off again. JetBlue said that passengers who were diverted to Bradley International would be reimbursed for their fares and hotel expenses. A spokesman for the Port Authority of . New York & New Jersey, which oversees Newark and JFK airports, could . not say how many flights were diverted because of equipment failures.","Several planes grounded in Connecticut by October snowstorm .

'He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.' A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department confirmed a Ferguson police officer shot the man. The spokesman didn't give the reason for the shooting. A large crowd of angry residents confronted police officers Saturday afternoon, yelling such things as 'kill the police' after an officer fatally shot a male in a St. Louis-area neighborhood. Officer Brian Schellman, spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said 'a couple hundred' people came out of apartment buildings after an officer with the Ferguson Police Department shot and killed the male. Schellman did not identify the person who was shot or say what prompted the shooting. The St Louis County Police Department has taken over the investigation. John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, called on the FBI's assistance was needed 'to protect the integrity of the investigation.' 'With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,' Gaskin said. Anger: A crowd was stopped by police as they were trying to reach the scene where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by police .

A witness Fox2Now that she saw Brown 'running for his life,' before he was shot. He turned around with his hands in the air, she said, but was shot twice more, resulting in his death. Schellman declined to give any information about the male who was shot, including his age or race, because police were still trying to notify relatives. After the shooting, some people yelled threats toward the police, and officers said they thought they heard gunshots, Schellman said. There were no reports of additional injuries, he said. After the crowd gathered, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents located a few miles north of downtown St. Louis. According to the U.S. Census Bureau from 2012, about two-thirds of the residents are black.Schellman said the crowd was under control by about 5 p.m. and several of the additional officers had left the area. Gaskin said the angry crowd was reacting to a 'trauma.' 'Anytime you have this type of event that's taken place, emotions are going to run high,' he said. 'But for 600 people to gather around an area to see where a man is lying in the street, that means something happened that should have not happened.'","18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead in the street by police officers near St Louis Saturday afternoon .

"Three black people are among the 12-member grand jury hearing evidence in the Michael Brown case. Paul Fox, director of judicial administration for St. Louis County Circuit Court, confirmed the racial and gender makeup of the grand jury on Friday. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said it will be several weeks before a decision is made on whether to charge Darren Wilson, the Ferguson officer who shot and killed Brown on Aug. 9. The grand jury consists of six white men, three white women, two black women and one black man. Nine votes are needed to indict. The ages and hometowns of the jurors weren't released. A judge is expected to consider Monday whether to make that information public. The Justice Department also is investigating Brown's death. Scroll down for video . Victim: Michael Brown, pictured, was shot and killed in a August 9 incident by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson . The fear among some local residents and officials trying to maintain peace in Ferguson is that failure to charge the officer could stoke new anger among a community profoundly mistrustful of the legal system. Many say they just hope the grand jury's decision, whatever it is, has irrefutable facts to back it up. U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill told The Associated Press she's pushing for federal and local investigations to be completed around the same time so that all evidence in the case can be made public - a step many consider important should prosecutors decide not to charge the officer. Her office said Friday that the Department of Justice hasn't given a timeline for the federal investigation, which centers on whether a civil rights violation occurred when officer Darren Wilson fatally shot the unarmed Brown Aug. 9. McCaskill, a former prosecutor in Missouri, said she's hopeful the physical evidence in the case - including blood spatter patterns, clothing and shell casings - will provide ""incontrovertible facts"" about what happened during the shooting. She said whatever local prosecutors decide, it will be important to explain the decision by providing that physical evidence, and that won't be possible if the federal investigation is ongoing. Ferguson has been rocked by the shooting. Protesters are seen on August 20 in Clayton, MIssouri . Doubts: Others have questioned District Attorney Bob McCulloch's impartiality in the case . McCaskill said she urged Attorney General Eric Holder during a meeting earlier this week to speed up what is typically a lengthier federal process. 'What we want to avoid is a decision being made without all the information being available to the public also,' McCaskill said, adding that not being able to do so could 'create more stress and certainly much more fear that we would be back to worrying about people being able to protest safely.' 'Obviously all of us are concerned not just about that this process be fair, but what does this next six months look like?' she said. Many residents who live in the Ferguson, eager to end the disruptions to their lives caused by protests and police presence, say they fear the community's anger will explode anew if Wilson isn't charged. 'This officer has to be indicted. I'd hate to see what happens if he isn't. The rioting, the looting, man ...,' said resident Larry Loveless, 29, as he stopped at the memorial for Brown where he was killed. St. Louis County prosecutors this week convened a grand jury to begin hearing evidence in the case, despite concerns among some in the community - including Brown's parents - that the office would not be impartial because of District Attorney Bob McCulloch's ties to law enforcement. McCulloch's father, mother and other relatives worked for St. Louis police, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect. He has said he will not remove himself from the case. The jury hearing evidence in the Michael Brown case consists of six white men, three white women, two black women and one black man . Considering the racial tensions of the case, even the makeup of the grand jury was being closely scrutinized. Two black women and one black man are on the 12-member panel, along with six white men and three white women, said Paul Fox, director of judicial administration for St. Louis County Circuit Court. Without specifically mentioning the grand jury's racial makeup, the Brown family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, said the panel 'works perfectly' as long as the prosecutor presents the necessary evidence and doesn't withhold information. Crump said the family doesn't believe the grand jury was necessary, arguing that the prosecutor had sufficient grounds to charge the officer on his own. The Department of Justice opened a parallel investigation, sending dozens of FBI agents to Ferguson to question witnesses. Finishing both investigations simultaneously would be unusual because federal investigators typically work independently of their state counterparts and at their own pace, said Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who is a University of Utah law professor. 'That is one of the advantages of a federal investigation. They tend to have a little more distance from the police officers who are being investigated. That provides some assurance of objectivity,' he said. He said prosecutors must avoid considering the potential reaction - even a violent one - on whether to file charges in any case. He said they must make 'a dispassionate judgment uninfluenced by public opinion.' The most likely state charges that will be considered in such a case include second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter, he said.","The grand jury consists of six white men, three white women, two black women and one black man .

"The first weekend of the new Premier League season brings a sense of anticipation and excitement for football fans around the world. As the 2014-15 campaign gets underway, we look back at some memorable opening games from years gone by... Arsenal 1-3 Aston Villa (2013) As Arsene Wenger's side walked out on the pitch, it was evident that the team was nearly identical to the one that finished the last campaign. Villa recorded a 3-1 victory and, when the final whistle blew, the Emirates Stadium erupted into boos, protesting the lack of money  spent on improving the squad. Wenger then splashed £42.5million to bring German international Mesut Ozil to north London from Real Madrid. Unrest: Arsenal fans were unhappy at the lack of money spent by manager Arsene Wenger .

"Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead on Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Hacker group Anonymous have reportedly released some 911 dispatch calls around the time of his death . Anonymous has apparently released St Louis police dispatch tapes today which reveal further details surrounding the cop shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. The computer hackers' collective posted two hours of the 911 calls online on Wednesday. On the tape, time-stamped between 12.05pm-12.35pm, a person, believed to be a dispatcher can be heard referring to an incident in Ferguson, Missouri. Additional squad cars were being requested from Ferguson Police Department for crowd control. With details unclear, the dispatcher revealed she has heard 'on the news' that actually it appears to be an 'officer involved shooting'. The dispatcher added that when she called Ferguson Police Department 'they don't know a thing about it'. About ten minutes into the two-hour recording, the dispatcher allegedly said: 'Ferguson is asking for assistance with crowd control... asking for [unclear] officer respond, can I send one?' She then added: 'They just told me they needed assistance on crowd control on Canfield and Coppercreek.' Around a minute later, the St Louis dispatcher said: 'She just said that they have a large group gathering there, she didn't know anything further.' Seconds later, the dispatcher said: 'We just got another call saying there was an officer involved shooting at Canfield and Coppercreek. I don't know who called it in but it was called into my desk.' A dispatcher then added: 'Be advised, this information came from the news.' The dispatcher then orders another St Louis squad car to the scene. A dispatcher then says: 'We just got the information from the news and we called Ferguson back again but they don't know anything about it.' A number of squad car numbers are then read out. The dispatcher appears to address one car: '2121 let me know what they have there, as soon as you get there.' Around a minute later, a dispatcher asked: 'You arrived on something, what were you arriving at? A few minutes pass with calls to other emergencies but the St Louis dispatchers continue to check in with their responding officers. One dispatcher said: 'If you need me to [unclear] at any point, I don't know if Ferguson is going to do that.' The intersection referred to on the tapes is close to the spot where Brown, 18, was shot dead by a Ferguson police office on Saturday. Listen to 'St Louis Police Dispatch 911 tapes' here . The release of the dispatch tapes comes after Anonymous earlier threatened to launch an online attack on police departments over alleged brutality in the killing of the teenager. Hacker collective Anonymous claimed today to have released St Louis' 911 dispatch tapes. The supposed details on the cop shooting in Ferguson are interspersed with other emergency calls. A basic transcript of elements of the call are below. Dispatcher (D): 'Ferguson is asking for assistance with crowd control... asking for [unclear] officer respond, can I send one?' D: 'They just told me they needed assistance on crowd control on Canfield and Coppercreek.' D: 'She just said that they have a large group gathering there, she didn't know anything further.' D: 'We just got another call saying there was an officer involved shooting at Canfield and Coppercreek. I don't know who called it in but it was called into my desk.' D: 'Be advised, this information came from the news.' The dispatcher then orders another St Louis squad car to the scene. D: 'We just got the information from the news and we called Ferguson back again but they don't know anything about it.' A number of squad car numbers then appear to be read out. The dispatcher appears to address one car: '2121 let me know what they have there, as soon as you get there.' Around a minute later, a dispatcher asked: 'You arrived on something, what were you arriving at? A few minutes pass with calls to other emergencies but the St Louis dispatchers continue to check in with their responding officers. One dispatcher said: 'If you need me to [unclear] at any point, I don't know if Ferguson is going to do that.' Police have cracked down hard on demonstrators in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, who took to the streets after the 18-year-old was shot dead. Despite calls for calm, officers fired tear gas and shot at least one person in a third night of rioting in the area on Tuesday. Police claimed the man shot had pulled a handgun on an officer. As police tried to put the area on lock-down, messages posted on a newly-established Twitter account called Operation Ferguson, which appeared to be linked to Anonymous, announced: 'We have a deep source, and we have a name we BELIEVE to be the shooter [of Michael Brown]. It does NOT match any of the names being floated. 'We have our best operatives working as hard as they can to verify the leak on the shooter we were passed. PLEASE be patient. 'When we release the name of Mike Brown's killer, it will be in an unequivocal statement released through this Twitter account. No games.' A little later another message suggested that the operation was proving more difficult than anticipated. 'To my fellow Anons, everyone remain chill,' it read. 'I realize this is an intense Op, and we are all trying our best. Let's fight cops not each other.' There has been anger from the teenager's parents and their supporters after the Ferguson Police Department decided not to publish the name of the officer who shot their son. At a rally in Ferguson on Tuesday, his mother, Lesley McSpadden, told the policeman who fired the shots: 'You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.' Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures. In a video posted on Sunday night, a self-declared spokesman for Anonymous warned Missouri police 'we are watching you very closely'. 'If you abuse, harass or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web-based asset of your departments and governments offline,' said a disguised voice, speaking over news footage of protests. 'That's not a threat, it is a promise.' In the video and a press release posted to the Pastebin website, the video says Anonymous will 'attack ever server and computer' belonging to the police departments involved, as well as 'release the personal information on every single member of the Ferguson Police Department, as well as any other jurisdiction that participates in the abuse.' Police officers keep watch while demonstrators protest the death of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on Tuesday night. Hackers' collective Anonymous has warned that it will punish acts of police brutality . 'We will seize all your databases and E-Mail spools and dump them on the Internet,' it said. 'This is your only warning.' There was no immediate way to verify the video was genuine or that any attacks or hacks have been effective. However an officer in the records department at Ferguson Police Department told MailOnline today that emails could not be sent because their system had been taken down. This remark could not be confirmed by the police department spokesman on Wednesday. Investigators have released few details about what they believe happened when Mr Brown was shot, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Michael and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request. The fullest account of Michael's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home with Michael when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who ordered them to move to the sidewalk. Mr Johnson told news crews that he and Brown kept walking and the officer then reversed his car 'to where it almost hit us.' The officer, Mr Johnson said, tried to open his door, but it 'ricocheted' back. Mr Johnson said the officer reached through the window, 'grabbed my friend around the neck' and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then pulled out his gun and said, '""I'll shoot you' or ""I'm going to shoot"",' Mr Johnson said. When the officer opened fire, Mr Brown was hit, said Mr Johnson, who hid behind a car. Mr Brown began running, Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson said the officer pursued Mr Brown and fired again. When Mr Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. The officer kept firing, Mr Johnson said. Mr Brown had just graduated from high school and was set to begin at technical college on Monday.","The computer hackers' collective posted two hours of the 911 calls online on Wednesday from St Louis police dispatch .

"The FBI has been handed a potentially crucial recording that allegedly contains audio of the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month. Revealed by CNN's Don Lemon on Monday, at least ten shots are heard to ring out during the background of the recording, with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four. The unidentified man who has given the unverified tape to authorities claims to have coincidentally recorded the fatal shots that killed Brown in broad daylight on August 9, and experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson. Scroll Down for Audio . Attorney: Lopa Blumenthal is legally representing the man who claims to have coincidentally recorded the shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9 . 'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy US Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN. 'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.' In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots can be heard to cackle in the background — seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four. Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown. 'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Blumenthal. 'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.' Lemon cautioned that 'CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape' but did say that the FBI have interviewed both Blumenthal and her client. 'We had been told that at least six shots were fired at Michael Brown. In the tape that you have, which is alleged to be of the shooting—we can't independently authorize it, as CNN, because we did not shoot it, but there were more than six shots,' Lemon said. Nightly . scenes of unrest have erupted in Ferguson since Officer Darren Wilson . fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, more than two . weeks ago . Officer Darren Wilson (right, collecting a commendation) has claimed that a confrontation sparked by a scuffle with Michael Brown led to the Ferguson teens fatal shooting on August 9 (left, Wilson paces around the body of Brown in the aftermath of the shooting) while witnesses claim the officer continued to shoot at an unarmed man with his hands up who had surrendered . Funeral: The casket containing the remains of Michael Brown awaiting the start of his funeral inside the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church, St Louis, Missouri, USA, on 25 August 2014 . Grief: Dorian Johnson, who is one of the key witnesses in the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, leaves Brown's funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, on Monday, 25, August . If indeed the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on that Saturday afternoon. At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head. Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling opening his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'. Johnson then alleges that Wilson continued to fire. Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire.

Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture. On Tuesday, The Gateway Pundit reported that the officer had suffered an 'orbital blowout fracture'. But CNN reported on Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury. Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source. A police source told Fox: 'The Assistant (Police) Chief took him to the hospital, his face all swollen on one side. He was beaten very severely.' Demonstrators protest the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last Thursday night . The source continued: 'They ignored him [Wilson] and the officer started to get out of the car to tell them to move. They shoved him right back in, that’s when Michael Brown leans in and starts beating Officer Wilson in the head and the face.' A police source has confirmed to MailOnline that Wilson was taken to hospital and treated for facial injuries sustained during the Brown incident but would not elaborate on the severity or nature of those injuries. Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries. Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime. He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him. Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox. Earlier reports had claimed that Officer Wilson was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows . Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has come under fire after calling for the 'vigorous prosecution' of Wilson despite the fact that the officer has not yet been charged with any crime. His deputy, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said: 'It's really heartbreaking to see a man elected to an office that high in our state government... come out with a statement like that, that does prejudge the case.' St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said on Wednesday he estimated it would be the middle of October before the grand jury reached a decision on whether Officer Wilson will face charges over Michael Brown's death. Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from Ferguson. Since the guard's arrival Monday, flare-ups in the small section of town that had been the center of nightly unrest have begun to subside. About 100 people gathered Thursday evening, walking in laps near the spot where Michael Brown was shot. Some were in organized groups, such as clergy members. More signs reflected calls by protesters to remove the prosecutor from the case.","Newly released audio allegedly records the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire on unarmed Michael Brown .

Mr Reilly wrote on Facebook: 'Tonight, along with a reporter from The Washington Post, I was arrested while reporting on the protests in Ferguson. 'Our apparent crime?

'I'm fine. But if this is the way these officers treat a white reporter working on a laptop who moved a little too slowly for their liking, I can't imagine how they treat others.' Tweeting live from their arrest, Mr Lowery said he was 'slammed' against a soda machine because he did not know which exit the police wanted him to take.

"How can it be that in 2014, fully 18 years into the professional game, England are going to play a three-match Test series in New Zealand and are being prevented from picking their strongest team for the vital first Test?   Those missing players represent the biggest cock-up since the 'Tour from Hell' in 1998! I inherited a crazy itinerary that year when, in very quick succession, an under-strength squad had to play Australia, New Zealand A, New Zealand Academy, the first All Blacks Test, New Zealand Maori in midweek, the second Test and then take a 16-hour flight to play South Africa in Cape Town. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Stuart Lancaster talking player selection and Danny Cipriani . Out on their feet: Jonny Wilkinson (left) and Martin Johnson after England's 76-0 defeat by Australia . Absolutely insane. That itinerary was put together by somebody who didn't put the England team first. Stuart Lancaster (England's current coach) is having to leap through logistical hoops when this battle should have been fought - and won - a long time ago. Do not think for one minute this is just one of those things and won't happen again. The Premiership has started to flex its muscles, as we have seen in the recent European Cup negotiations. England should always comes first if you want to win a World Cup. The visit by England will be a massive . financial driver for the NZRFU and you would think the RFU might have . negotiated much harder on England's behalf. The All Blacks never come . cheaply when they visit these shores and accept only the itinerary that . suits them. And I don't blame them. Disappointment: England coach Clive Woodward during the 76-0 defeat by Australia in Brisbane . Was enough . effort really made to get New Zealand to put the Test schedule back by a . week, which would have helped immensely? Were the England players . consulted at all? How much was Lancaster consulted? If I was a first-choice player such as Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood, Luther . Burrell, Owen  Farrell and Billy Vunipola - who will all miss out . because of the Premiership final - I would be livid at even being put in . this position. You dedicate large chunks of your career to win selection. You overcome . injuries to fight for  the jersey, earning the right  to play against . New Zealand  at Eden Park. Then, suddenly, your place is handed on a . plate to somebody else. Controversy: England's last two visits to New Zealand have been ruined by off-field incidents . This tour is starting on the back foot and it . will be great credit to Lancaster, his coaches, and especially the . players, if they come back with more positives than negatives from the . hardest school in world rugby. Make no mistake, though, this tour is . ideal for England as they prepare for RWC 2015; they need to find out . where they are as a team and make some informed judgments on their . players. Ideally, I would like to have seen an extra couple of fixtures, . certainly another midweek game against the Maori, to get a large squad . operating as one but it's still an exciting itinerary. It is also massively important off the field because England's last two . visits to New Zealand have been ruined by off-field incidents. End-of-season tours of New Zealand are just plain difficult but England . must flip the psychology around. English rugby is in a good place, with . a strong group of players on an upward curve and an excellent coaching . team improving with every game. Challenge: Tour has started on the back foot for England coach Stuart Lancaster . England can . still put out a very competitive side next Saturday against a New . Zealand team that will be short on preparation. England should all be . highly motivated and, for many, it will still be the most important game . of their careers so far. Lancaster . must challenge those selected to produce the performance of their . careers and come away with a win. England aren't meant to win in New . Zealand. It doesn't happen very often, nobody will be expecting it. But . it could happen. The All Blacks will be strong favourites but there is an opportunity to . build a classic backs-to-the-wall mentality in Auckland ahead of the . first Test. If England win it will automatically make them favourites . for the World Cup - and that is what they should be aspiring to be. Recall: Fly-half Danny Cipriani last played for England in 2008 . If England do win, it gets very interesting psychologically. Only 'special' teams beat the All Blacks in New Zealand so  Lancaster would then have to decide whether to parachute in those five or six first-choice players  who were unavailable. Do you stick with the team that won or introduce players  champing at the bit to get their shirts back? That would be a great dilemma to face. I believe that could be the case but touring New Zealand is the hardest assignment bar none. To win, you need everyone's noses pointing in the same direction and the Premiership and the RFU have let down this group of players.","England coach Stuart Lancaster is having to leap through logistical hoops .

"Not mincing words: Ex-NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly had some harsh words for his colleagues in Ferguson, Missouri, saying that the local police should have been more forthcoming with details on the shooting . Former New York City Police Department commissioner Raymond Kelly has weighed in on the volatile situation in Ferguson, Missouri, upbraiding local authorities for their handling of the Michael Brown shooting. Kelly, 72, who served as New York City's top cop for more than a decade, had some harsh words for Ferguson’s law enforcement, calling on the town's officials to release information about the shooting of the 18-year-old unarmed black teenager. In a phone interview with Bloomberg News Tuesday, Kelly said that the Ferguson Police Department might have prevented some of the violence that engulfed the community had it been forthcoming with the details of the deadly confrontation between Brown and Officer Darren Warner. ‘It certainly has the potential for quelling or lessening disturbances,’ Kelly told Bloomberg News. ‘You tell them what you know and tell them what you don’t know, rather than dribbling it out.’ Kelly, who currently heads risk management services for real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc, was likely alluding to his department's response to the 2006 killing of Sean Bell - an unarmed African-American man who was fatally shot by officers 50 times outside a Queens nightclub on the eve of his wedding. Bell's violent death sparked anger among African-American leaders and the community at large, but no widespread riots or looting. Scroll down for video . What if: Kelly suggested that Ferguson police officials, among them Chief Thomas Jackson (pictured), might have prevented some of the violence by releasing details about the shooting in a more timely fashion . Recent history: Kelly was at the helm of the NYPD in 2006 when his officers shot Sean Bell, a 23-year-old unarmed black man,  50 times outside a nightclub . Officer Wilson shot Brown six times August 9, but it was not until nearly a week later that information started trickling out about the incident and the 28-year-old cop at the center of the firestorm. ‘The toothpaste is out of the tube here,’ Kelly said. ‘There’s lots of things that should have been done differently, and you have to live with them.’ Mr Kelly, who stood at the helm of the NYPD from January 2002 until December 2013 as part of Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration, also did not mince words when addressing the skewed racial makeup of the Ferguson police force. The former top cop called it 'mind-boggling' that only three out of the 53 cops serving the Missouri town were black given that Ferguson was nearly 70 per cent African-American. While much has been written and said about the presence of armored vehicles and officers in tactical gear more often seen in combat zones than American suburbia, Kelly stopped short of calling out the perceived over-militarization of Ferguson’s police. Racial makeup: Ray Kelly said that it was 'mind-boggling' to him that Ferguson's police had only three black officers in a city that is nearly 70 per cent African-American in its makeup . A citizen peacekeeper tries to keep protesters back as police advance Monday in Ferguson . 'Not their core mission': Kelly said that National Guardsmen who were called in to restore order in the St Louis suburb were not trained for policing the streets . He did, however, note that National Guardsmen who have been called up by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to restore order in Ferguson were not trained in 'policing tactics.' In 2011, Kelly came under sharp criticism from civil libertarians for cracking down on Occupy Wall Street protesters in Manhattan. Kelly was also attacked in the media for perpetuating the controversial stop-and-frisk policy, under which hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, the vast majority of them minorities, were subjected to searches by police.","Kelly served as commissioner in Michael Bloomberg's administration from 2002 to 2013 .

"The White House is conducting a review of the programs that allow local police departments to purchase military gear from the Pentagon, urged by President Barack Obama's call for a greater separation between the nation's armed forces and civilian law enforcement. The examination comes in the aftermath of the police response to unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police killing of unarmed black man Michael Brown. Two senior administration officials said Saturday that the review will examine whether the programs are appropriate; the amount of training provided for using military equipment; and how well the government audits the use of the money and equipment by local police departments. Extreme: A heavily-armed riot police officer on guard during a demonstration in Ferguson, Missouri on August 13, 2014.President Obama has ordered a review of the distribution of military hardware to state and local police out of concern at how such equipment has been used during racial unrest in the state .

Ferguson: Police shot smoke and tear gas to disperse protestors on August 18 and were heavily armed with equipment not typically seen in such a small city . The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the review by name. The review will be led by White House staff including the Domestic Policy Council, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, and agencies such as the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice and Treasury. The officials say the review will be coordinated with Congress, where several lawmakers have called for a re-examination of the military-to-police programs. On Monday, Obama acknowledged that the images of well-armed police confronting protesters with combat weapons in Ferguson made it useful to review how local law enforcement agencies have used federal grants that permit them to obtain heavier armaments. 'There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,' Obama told reporters at the White House. Excessive?: Police charge into the media work area with rifles at ready as they try to control demonstrators protesting the killing of teenager Michael Brown on August 19, 2014 in Ferguson .

"White Republicans think race is getting too much attention in Ferguson, Missouri where violent protests have erupted following the cop shooting of an unarmed black teenager. According to new research from the Pew Center, almost half of white people (47 per cent) surveyed think that race is getting too much attention in Ferguson compared to 18 per cent of black people and 25 per cent of Hispanics who feel the same way. Some 61 per cent of Republicans think that racial issues are grabbing too many headlines compared to 21 per cent of Democrats and 46 per cent of Independents, according to the poll of 1,000 adults. Scroll down for video . Protesters on Monday night in Ferguson alongside Amnesty International workers who have moved in to monitor the situation for the first time ever in the U.S.  Conservative commentators have said race is getting too much attention following the riots in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting . Another survey question show a racial divide in trusting the police to carry out a thorough investigation. More than half (52 per cent) of white people surveyed said they had confidence in the shooting investigation compared to only 18 per cent of black people. The research appeared to lend support to the tone of some conservative commentators who have been quick to slam Obama for his perceived racial basis. The President called for understanding in the face of racially-charged anger on Monday, saying that the vast majority of protesters in a St. Louis suburb were peaceful, but warned that a small minority was undermining justice. He expressed sympathy for the 'passions and anger' sparked by the death of Brown but said giving in to that anger through looting and attacks on police only stirs tensions and leads to further chaos. He said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to 'listen and not just shout.' 'That's how we're going to move forward together, by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another,' Obama told reporters at the White House. Fox News host Todd Starnes tweeted about another comment Obama had made after a reporter's question about racial tensions in Ferguson. Starnes posted: 'Obama: ""I have to be very careful about not pre-judging."" Well, that train has already left the station.' Almost half of white people surveyed by Pew believed that race was getting too much attention following the shooting of Michael Brown . Conservative lawyer Larry Klayman accused the President of starting a 'race war' and giving preferential treatment to his 'black brothers'. Journalist Daniel Greenfield wrote a piece for FrontPage magazine entitled 'Obama's Racism For Fun And Profit' where he remarked: 'Obama sends racial and post-racial signals...He tends to avoid explicitly racist rhetoric. Instead he empowers those who do.' The Pew research on Ferguson followed a study on Monday which found more than half of black Americans think Officer Darren Wilson should be convicted of murdering Michael Brown - compared to just 17 per cent of white Americans. The results, from a survey carried out by Rasmussen, revealed a stark difference in attitudes towards the death of the 18-year-old, which has sparked riots in the St Louis suburb and across the U.S. Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of the 1,000 American adults surveyed believe Wilson should be found guilty of murder, while another quarter (26 per cent) thought he was acting in self defense when he gunned down the unarmed teenager in broad daylight on August 9. But 57 per cent of black adults think he should be convicted compared to only 17 per cent of white Americans and 24 per cent of other minority Americans. Of those who are undecided about what should happened to Wilson, most - 56 per cent - are white. The survey results also showed that black Americans are more convinced that the violent riots since the killing are legitimate outrage rather than criminal activity. The racial divide: 80 per cent of black people surveyed thought Brown's shooting raised racial issues (left) while three-quarters of African-Americans had little confidence in the police to investigate properly . Police have said they fired tear gas and rubber bullets in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails over the weekend. Exactly a quarter of all those surveyed said they believed the protests have mostly been legitimate outrage, whereas 52 per cent think the riots have been carried out by criminals taking advantage of the situation. Among these, 54 per cent of white Americans and 53 per cent of other minorities think the violence is mostly down to criminals, compared to 35 per cent of black people surveyed. In addition, black Americans are more likely to think the protests are legitimate anger. As tension grows in Ferguson, the Missouri State Police and the state National Guard have been called in to help deal with the violence. Of those who took part in the survey, 27 per cent believe the police have responded well, while a similar percentage - 28 - call their response 'poor'. Conservative commentators, among them Fox host Todd Starnes, have claimed President Obama is showing racial bias when it comes to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson last week . The results also showed that black Americans were more than twice as likely as whites and other minority adults to rate the police response as poor. The racial divide apparent in the survey results is reminiscent of the trial of George Zimmerman, who shot dead an unarmed African-American teenager in Florida in 2012. Zimmerman was found not guilty at a trial last year. This latest survey shows that eight out of ten black voters believe the system is unfair to minorities. Brown, 18, was shot dead on August 9 and sustained six bullet wounds, including the fatal shot to the top of his head. His killer was identified as Darren Wilson, who has since been placed on paid administrative leave. The survey by Rasmussen Reports was carried out on August 15 and 16 and involved 1,000 people.

"A Ferguson cop is being sued over claims he hog-tied a 12-year-old boy while he checked his family's mailbox. Officer Justin Cosma had a civil rights lawsuit filed against him in 2012 after he and another cop Richard Carter allegedly left the child with choke marks around his neck, cuts and bruises in June  2010. Cosma was reportedly part of a group of Ferguson officers who arrested two journalists who were in a McDonald's restaurant earlier this month amid the riots over the cop shooting of Michael Brown. Scroll down for video . Officer Justin Cosma had a civil rights lawsuit filed against him in 2012 after claims he hog-tied a 12-year-old boy outside of his family home . The lawsuit alleged that while Cosma was working with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, he became 'confrontational' with the child while investigating reports of a boy playing on the highway, the Huffington Post reported. The child denied that he had been playing on the road however, according to the suit: 'Unprovoked and without cause, the deputies grabbed [the boy], choked him around the neck and threw him to the ground. The boy was shirtless at the time, and allegedly 'suffered bruising, choke marks, scrapes and cuts across his body.' The lawsuit also claimed that the child was 'hog-tied'. The 12-year-old was treated at a medical center. The two cops reported the incident as 'assault of a law enforcement officer'. Prosecutors refused to take up a juvenile case against the child. The lawsuit was brought by the boy's family in September 2012, soon after he joined the Ferguson force. It is unclear why he left the Jefferson County Department. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the family's lawyer today and from Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson. The lawyer previously said he expected a trial date to be set for early next year. The Huffington Post reported that Cosma was one of the officers who arrested one of their own reporters and another Washington Post journalist at a McDonald's in Ferguson during the riots - but refused to give his name or badge number. At least ten journalists were arrested or detained since Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was killed August 9 by Ferguson officer Darren Wilson. Wilson is on leave and has gone into hiding pending the outcome of a civil rights investigation into the shooting death of the 18-year-old. Reporter Ryan J.

"Eleven members of the Washington Redskins team ran out into the field for Monday night's preseason game against the Cleveland Browns with their hands up and palms forward. The ‘Hands up, don't shoot’ gesture was a show of solidarity with the people in Ferguson, Missouri, who are protesting the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 by a white police officer. Scroll down for video . Eleven members of the Washington Redskins team ran out into the field for Monday night's preseason game against the Cleveland Browns with their hands up and palms forward . The idea to show solidarity for the dead  came from safety Brandon Meriweather and cornerback DeAngelo Hall. Meriweather said the team's defensive backs decided as a group to pay a pregame tribute as they came through the tunnel and onto FedEx Field. ‘We just want to show our supporters what’s going on in St. Louis,’ Meriweather told WNEW. ‘That could have been any one of us,’ said Safety Ryan Clark. ‘That could have been any one of our brothers, our cousins. ...When you get an opportunity to make a statement and be more than a football player, it's good.’ The Redskins defeated the Browns 24-23. The 'Hands up, don't shoot' show of solidarity was the idea of players including safety Brandon Meriweather . Protesters have gathered daily in Ferguson since Brown was fatally was shot on August 9. Police say Brown struggled with the officer before being shot six times, but witnesses have said he was not aggressive toward the officer and had his hands raised above his head before he was shot. As a result, the words 'hands up, don’t shoot' have become a rallying cry of protesters, both in Ferguson and online. Monday night saw a ninth evening of protests and disturbances in the town. A St. Louis County spokeswoman says 57 people were booked at the county jail. Just four of the 57 arrested had Ferguson addresses. Fifty-four were cited for failure to disperse, two for unlawful use of a weapon, and one for interfering with an officer. Sixteen of those arrested are from out of state.

"A woman in Ferguson, Missouri, spoke out Friday saying that a month before the Michael Brown shooting, she had a run-in with officer Darren Wilson in which the cop allegedly hurled obscenities at her and made threats to arrest her. Wilson was identified earlier today by Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson as the officer who stopped Brown, 18, last Saturday for blocking traffic and ultimately shot him eight times. During a live interview with CNN presenter Don Lemon, a young woman who did not give her name said that Officer Wilson once told her to 'shut the f*** up’ and ‘sit the f*** down' as she was trying to wash mace out of her eyes. Scroll down for video . Character witness: CNN's Don Lemon (right) interviewed a woman in Ferguson (center) Friday who offered an account of her confrontation with Officer Darren Wilson a month ago . Run-in: The woman said she was maced a month ago and walked into a store to wash her eyes, but Officer Darren Wilson told her to 'shut the f*** up' and threatened to arrest her if she poured milk in her eyes to ease the sting of pepper spray . The woman said that she went inside the QuickTrip grocery store in Ferguson about a month ago to get help after being pepper-sprayed in the face under unknown circumstances. Employees at the store let the woman use their sink to clean her eyes and suggested that she use milk. As she was pouring the dairy product in her eyes, the woman said police officers walked into the convenience store and ordered her to get out. ‘I came outside and I was trying to pour milk in my eyes and Wilson told me if I poured milk in my eyes, I was going to be arrested,’ she said on CNN. In cop's defense: Wilson's friend Jake Shepard told CNN he is certain the officer was in fear for his life when the pulled the trigger . ‘And I was trying to tell him that my eyes were burning because I was maced, but he told me to “shut the F up.”’ The officer then allegedly made the woman sit on concrete as he took down her information. When she renewed her efforts to treat her eyes with milk, she said Wilson again told her to 'shut the f*** up and sit the f*** down.' ‘I was looking at his name tag and I was telling myself that I would never forget who he was and what he did to me,’ said the woman. ‘And I prayed on it and I asked God to get revenge on him.’ For nearly a week, the police officer who shot and killed the unarmed black teenager has been a shadowy figure — nameless, faceless and seemingly shielded from the fury that has filled the streets of the town he was sworn to protect. On Friday, the community finally learned his name — Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white officer who has spent the last six years patrolling the St. Louis suburbs, drawing praise from his boss. Ferguson Police Chief Jackson provided the name and said Wilson had not been the focus of any public complaints. He declined to offer many details about Wilson's life or career but commended his police record and his demeanor.

(AP Photo/St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Robert Cohen) 'He was a gentle, quiet man,' Jackson said. 'He was a distinguished officer. He is, has been, an excellent officer for the police department.' Wilson has been on administrative leave since the August 9 shooting. According to a report by USA Today, no one answered the door Friday at Wilson's home in Crestwood - a town 18 miles from Ferguson - and a police officer guarding the property said that the family had left the area days earlier. A neighbor told the paper that Wilson, described as 'tall and slim,' was often seen walking his dog. Public records obtained by The Washington Post indicate that as a teenager, Wilson was an honor roll student at Charles High School. He lost his mother at age 16. Neighbor Martha Arnoldy, the wife of the Crestwood police chief, told The Post that Wilson and his family are in a 'safe place.' The officer reportedly packed up and left his house so quickly that laundry was left hanging in the backyard. Wilson's friend Jake Shepard told CNN he could not imagine the officer killing somebody. 'I can say without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements that, at that moment in time, he was scared for his life,' Shepard said. 'He's just the last person on Earth that you would think to do something like that. It's just shocking.' The friend described the 28-year-old man as a quiet yet caring person with a 'huge heart' who would give the shirt off his back to anyone in need. Police said Wilson stopped 18-year-old Michael Brown and another young man because they were walking down the middle of the street. He ordered them onto the sidewalk. Authorities say one of the men pushed Wilson into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with him over the officer's weapon.

Wilson is 'devastated' by last weekend's events, the police chief said. 'He never intended for any of this to happen.' The killing touched off day after day of violent protests, which were met by an aggressive police response that included officers in riot gear pointing assault rifles, firing rubber bullets and unleashing tear gas. On Thursday, the governor ordered Missouri State Police to take over security in Ferguson. Within hours, the tension in the streets began to ease. But during a protest Friday night, chaos once again reigned on the streets of Ferguson as angry demonstrators threw bottles and blocked traffic, prompting police to hurl smoke bombs and issue an order to disperse.

"Hello to Louis van Gaal, goodbye to the Manchester United we have known for a lifetime. In the same way Liverpool’s ‘boot room’ culture was consigned to the past when Gerard Houllier arrived in 1998, some of the traditions and methods that, for so long, were part of United’s fabric will no longer mean what they did. The appointment of Van Gaal, the first foreign manager to rule at Old Trafford, now means they will be susceptible to the issues and changes that impacted on all other clubs in the Barclays Premier League while United, under Sir Alex Ferguson, dominated. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal draw laughter from reporters as he sayshe is smart . All set: Louis van Gaal looks in good spirits as he takes charge of a training session on Friday . In demand: Van Gaal is surrounded by autograph hunters as he arrives at the team hotel on Friday . Now don’t get me wrong — I’m not criticising United’s selection of Van Gaal. He comes with an outstanding pedigree and enters our game on the back of a tremendous summer when he led Holland to third place at the World Cup. He knows what he wants and isn’t afraid to speak his mind. Clearly, it is going to be his way and his alone. He may have chosen Ryan Giggs to be his assistant and provide a link to the glorious past but a number of Van Gaal’s blunt comments illustrate how things are going to be so different at United. First he was critical about the balance of the squad — could you imagine David Moyes saying that 12 months ago about the one he inherited from Ferguson? — and he would have left board members squirming when attacking the scheduling of their lucrative United States tour. Changed days: Van Gaal will get rid of some of the methods that were commonplace under Sir Alex Ferguson . Another bone of contention revolves around Luke Shaw. He, like Ander Herrera, is what you would describe as being a ‘United signing’ rather than a Van Gaal purchase. United scouted Shaw more than a dozen times last season and he was joining this summer regardless of who was manager. United spent £30million to land England’s future long-term left back, but Van Gaal has called him unfit and has been tracking Sporting Lisbon’s Marcos Rojo and Ajax’s Daley Blind, a player he knows inside out. Both can play in Shaw’s position. Issues such as these can cause tension behind the scenes. Uncertain: Luke Shaw arrives at a Manchester hotel on Friday but will miss United's Premier League opener . On the radar: Argentina defender Marcos Rojo (left) is the subject of interest from van Gaal . On the move? Ajax and Holland's Daley Blind is being tracked by his former international boss van Gaal . Then there was his complaint about Carrington, United’s training base, being ‘too exposed to wind’ —an issue that hasn’t been raised in public during the previous 14 years they had been there. But this is how he will put his stamp on the facility, along with two new Desso pitches — at a cost of £800,000 — to replicate exactly Old Trafford’s surface. Something similar happened at Melwood when Houllier came in. He made the pitches at Melwood exactly the same measurements and the same feel as Anfield. There were wooden shooting boards dotted around the field, which had been used daily since they were brought in by Bill Shankly, but Houllier removed them all. He banned mobile phones, too. Houllier arrived on the back of helping France win the 1998 World Cup and Phil Thompson and Sammy Lee, European Cup winners who cherished the boot-room philosophy, had their eyes opened to what traditionalists viewed as radical changes. They embraced the innovation. When Rafa Benitez followed in 2004, coming with a c.v. that included two La Liga titles and a UEFA Cup with Valencia, he did things his own way too, paying no heed to what Houllier had done. More changes were made to Melwood, including the installation of a steep running hill. Making his mark: Gerard Houllier (right) made several innovative changes when he took charge of Liverpool . New man: Rafael Benitez did things his own way when he took over at Liverpool in 2004 . Benitez was single-minded and different in so many ways to Houllier. When he was trying to explain how a situation might unfold in a game, he used to physically move players around the pitch, pushing and pulling them into positions. New methods could take you aback. Occasionally we would think to ourselves ‘that can’t be right’ as Houllier and Benitez tried to get their points across but, even if you didn’t agree with them, you would not think twice about doing what they said, as they had a c.v. to back up their actions. That is exactly what it will be like for United’s players with Van Gaal. Even if they doubt him, they will feel compelled to follow him. There will be no uncertainty, unlike the situation with David Moyes, who appeared caught between doing things his own way and trying to respect United’s heritage. Tradition demands United play with flying wingers. Ferguson did it, Ron Atkinson and Sir Matt Busby did it, but Van Gaal is going to dispense with that system for the time being and opt to go with three central defenders. I admire managers who get the most out of the squads they have to work with; Van Gaal doesn’t have a winger of Angel di Maria’s quality, so playing three at the back allows his three best attackers — Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata — to play in their best, central positions. Leading from the front: New Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney jogs during training on Friday . Tough going: David Moyes appeared caught between his own methods and respecting United's heritage . After a number of good results during pre-season, culminating in the 2-1 success against Valencia on Tuesday, has allowed optimism to build. But I don’t see how a change in formation and two signings will catapult them back to the top. In 16 seasons at club level, Van Gaal — who has won seven league titles — has finished outside the top three on just three occasions, but his aim will be to get United into the Champions League. I expect a strong challenge for the top four but, to get there, they still need two quality defensive additions. As a target, that is at odds with everything United have strived for over the past two decades. But these are changing times — and nothing shows that more than the man who will oversee matters against Swansea this lunchtime. In charge: Van Gaal dishes out orders to Holland players during the World Cup in Brazil earlier this summer . I'm hoping for another colossus like Kompany . During the middle of the best World Cup we have seen for a long time, I lamented the lack of top-class defenders who are operating in the world game now. While it was terrific to see so many countries engage attack and look to score so many goals, I just felt there was something missing — a standout display, the kind we used to get from Franco Baresi, Jurgen Kohler and Marcel Desailly. Players of that ilk, though, are few and far between and that has been shown by the fact that Barcelona and Manchester United, two giants of the game, were scraping to sign Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal. He is a good defender but he couldn’t displace Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Elation: Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany lifts the Premier League trophy at the end of last season . We all loved seeing so many goals at the World Cup and, of course, we will want to see the new Barclays Premier League campaign lit up with the same kind of entertainment and flair, but I would also like to see some top-class defensive displays, too. I have made my admiration for Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany clear on these pages before. He continues to set the standard, so it will be fascinating to see how Eliaquim Mangala fares alongside him after his £32million move from FC Porto. Liverpool have spent big on Dejan Lovren and Manchester United will continue looking for a big addition until the transfer window closes. Coaches always know that looking after the back is as important, if not more, than what happens up front. New man in town: Eliaquim Mangala trains with Manchester City after joining from FC Porto in a £32m move . Fun and games: Liverpool's Dejan Lovren (right) shares a laugh with Daniel Sturridge during training on Friday . My excitement at the start of the new campaign is the same as I felt when I was a young lad growing up and, all being well, the action will be just as good as last year. Chelsea and Manchester City are the teams to beat in the title race but there are so many other strands to follow. So… . I'm keeping an eye on... How teams cope with using three at the back. That system seems in vogue, with a number of sides getting ready to use it, but how long will it stay that way? It will be interesting to see what the teams do if results start going against them. I'm looking forward to... Seeing Diego Costa go to war with central defenders. With Luis Suarez gone, Chelsea’s £32million summer signing from Atletico Madrid looks the most likely candidate to take my old team-mate’s role of top goalscorer — and chief villain. Fighting them off: Diego Costa (centre) is put under pressure during a Chelsea training session at Cobham . I've got big hopes for... James Ward-Prowse. The Southampton midfielder has been the subject of good reports and I know he was the standout player when England’s Under 20s played in Toulon this summer. If the 19-year-old progresses, he could be pushing for the senior squad at some point.

"Former Tory MP Edwina Currie was ordered off Twitter this morning by her husband . Former Tory MP Edwina Currie was ordered off Twitter this morning by her husband after she was rounded on by people slating her for saying people who use food banks spend their cash on tattoos and dog food. Speaking on a BBC Radio Stoke last week, the 67-year-old former MP said food banks were not a long term solution and questioned whether they were really needed in the UK. She said many people using food banks across UK spent any spare cash they had - not on food - but on tattoos and food for their pets. She said: 'I get very, very troubled at the number of people who are using food banks who think that it's fine to pay to feed their dog, their dog is in good nick and beautiful, but they never learn to cook, they never learn to manage and the moment they've got a bit of spare cash they're off getting another tattoo. 'We should feel cross about this, all of us.' Labour MP Tom Watson tweeted after the radio show was broadcast last week: '@Edwina-Currie your comments on food bank users are appalling.' And on Twitter last night, scores of people vented their anger at the former Tory MP - who was the first dancer to be eliminated from Strictly in 2011 - saying her comments were vile. In the end the former politician - who was forced to resign from her job as a junior health minister in 1988 after wrongly saying that the majority of egg production in the UK was affected by salmonella - was ordered off Twitter by her husband John Jones, a retired police detective who spent 35 years in the force. At 1.15am today - after a barrage of abuse on Twitter - she tweeted: 'Hubby is demanding I stop tweeting and go pay him some attention. I hear and obey' Speaking on a BBC Radio Stoke last week, the 67-year-old former MP said food banks were not a long term solution and questioned whether they were really needed in the UK . At 1.15am today - after a barrage of abuse on Twitter - she tweeted: 'Hubby is demanding I stop tweeting and go pay him some attention. I hear and obey.' She had previously tried to defend her comments, tweeting last night: 'Some councils are diverting money from services into food banks. I think this is crazy - a real abrogation of responsibility.' She also tweeted: 'How do we solve people's problems? Not by giving them a can of soup and saying there, there.' Other tweets from the ex-Tory MP included 'Some others need real help, not sticking plaster tins of soup' and 'Food banks don't solve problems. They just ensure people go on living with problems. For decades'. Twitter users slammed her comments, with Michael Greenwell tweeting: 'Wow. I couldn't have imagined Edwina Currie would say anything more stupid, but she's managed it.' Peter Smith tweeted: 'It's SO much easier to attack the poor than attack poverty isn't it @Edwina-Currie? Man at our local foodbank cos he couldn't afford food after travelling 45 miles to his 0 hours min wage job. Explain that @Edwina-Currie.' The number of people using food banks has tripled since 2012 and charity The Trussell Trust - which provide hundreds of foodbanks across the UK - said around 1m people regularly use them . Labour MP Chris Bryant, the Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform, tweeted: 'Edwina Currie hasn't the foggiest idea how ordinary people live their lives but resorts to crude judgementalism. Sad.' Shaysda tweeted: 'So @Edwina-Currie thinks food banks don't help people out of trouble, they merely perpetuate it, & users are tattoo wearing devil dog owners.' Louise Brown tweeted: 'Edwina Currie quick to cast judgement on ppl she says are tattooed chain smoking scroungers yet cast Savile as harmless philanthropist;idiot.' In 2012, Edwina Currie defending giving pervert Jimmy Savile a role at Broadmoor in 1988 after appointing him as part of a taskforce at the hospital when she was a junior health minister. Savile was subsequently accused of sexually abusing patients at the high security hospital. The number of people using foodbanks has tripled since 2012 and charity The Trussell Trust - which provide hundreds of foodbanks across the UK - said around 1m people regularly use them. Rob Flello, Labour's MP for Stoke-on-Trent South, said he was 'incensed' by the former health minister's comments. He said: 'Mrs Currie's remarks are outrageous. I find it astonishing that a former health minister who claims to have her finger on the pulse should express such ill-informed views that are completely divorced from reality.' 'I invite Mrs Currie to spend a day with me in the Potteries talking to people who run and use foodbanks. Only then may she realise how out of touch she really is.' Nikki Sinclaire, MEP for the West Midlands - and who has helped to donate and deliver three tons of food to foodbanks - said he was disgusted by the former MP's comments. She said: 'This type of perpetuating myth that poor people are filling their boots, people on benefits, not all people that go to foodbanks are on benefits. 'Generally foodbanks work on a system where they can only go there two or three times. 'The comments Edwina is making, I find that they have no relation to reality.' Arthur Heath, of Stoke, said: 'This from a woman that went along with the biggest transfer of wealth from poor to the rich in history. 'Thatcher and her cronies, including the despicable Ms Currie, set out to create a system whereby the wealthy thrive on the misery of the underclass.'? Edwina tweeted that her husband John Jones had ordered her off Twitter . Geraldine Benson, 51, said: 'Edwina Currie's comments are vile and a disgusting insult on people living on the poverty line.

'People using foodbanks are in urgent need - they do not to feel like paupers because they have a dog or have a tattoo . During Edwina Currie's interview on BBC Radio Stoke she also said she couldn't see how foodbanks were useful. She said: 'For the life of me I can't see how giving someone a tin of soup when they are suffering from a mental illness or when they've got debt problems is going to contribute in any long term way to solving their problems. 'It is such a short term help. If people have got into debt one of the key things that they should be asking themselves is why did I get into debt and what did I do that was stupid to get into debt and what can I avoid doing in the future? 'How do I actually take control of my life so that I am not in this situation?' She added: 'One of the things I think an older generation like myself and perhaps even older than that, like my grandparents who lived in real poverty in Liverpool, what they all realised is that difficult times do come and that what you have to do in the good times is to put a little bit of money to one side to make sure that you have got that as support.'","The 67-year-old former MP said foodbanks were not a long-term solution .

"It has been five long years since 13-year-old Marcellous Bennett and his older brothers pistol whipped and robbed a pizza delivery driver in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Since then, Bennett has been to juvenile detention and remains on probation for the crime. His older brothers, both members of local gangs, are still serving time in prison. But Bennett has made an unlikely ally, one who is now mentoring him and helping him stay away from trouble: the victim of his crime. 'I see a lot of myself in Marcell,' Brady Middleton, 24, told The Grand Rapids Press in a interview about their redemption story, from assailant and victim to close friends. 'I don’t see Marcell as a sum of mistakes and where he’s from. I see him as a human. That’s bigger and more important than any mistake, any background.' Buddies: Marcellous Bennett (left), 18, and Brady Middleton, 24, have come a long way from when Bennett, then 13, assaulted Middleton while he worked as a pizza delivery driver . After the attack, Middleton needed 70 stitches and three years of physical therapy . Middleton, then 19, was on his last pizza delivery in 2009 when he buzzed the apartment where Bennett and his two older brothers were. He heard a gun cock to his side. 'Everything slowed down,' he told the Press. 'My heart dropped.' The man with the gun told him to get down on his knees. 'I thought it was over at that point in time,' he told the paper. 'I asked him, ‘Are you going to kill me?’ He said, ‘Yes.'' When Middleton thought all was lost, the man ran away and all three suspects fled in his delivery car. Middleton was left with a cut above his left eye that required 70 stitches, post-traumatic stress disorder and had to be in physical therapy for three years for post-concussion syndrome. The three suspects were eventually arrested and sentenced for the crime. When Middleton confronted one of his adult assailants in court, he told him, 'You not only stole my car and money that night, you stole something more valuable: my genuine trust in people and my surroundings.' But once Middleton saw Bennett in court — a 13-year-old boy following the only example he'd seen growing up — his heart began to soften. 'My gosh, this is a child,' he thought. 'How the heck does somebody get there?' He started attending all of Bennett's court hearings and offered the troubled teen words of encouragement. Once Bennett was released from juvenile detention, Middleton dropped by his foster home. The two played video games for a while, and Middleton finally asked him the question that burned in his mind: 'Why?' 'It was just what I seen, I breathed, I looked, I did,' Bennett told the Press. 'It was a family thing. Some people can’t help the fact that all they brothers is gang members. So when I was growing up, that’s all I seen.' The two men have forged an unlikely friendship since Bennett and his older brothers attacked Middleton in 2009 . But slowly, Bennett started to realize he didn't need to enter a life of crime just because of the example he'd had. 'That changed my life at that point in . time more than the assault,' Middleton told the Press. 'It was indicative of a . bigger problem — this just wasn’t about me' 'I knew that he cared about my future, so it was nothing but respect,' the 18-year-old added about his mentor. Bennett is studying to become a barber and works as a cook in Portage, Michigan. His probation will be over in a year. Once that's taken care of, he wants to go live on his own and is considering studying business administration in college. Middleton has already offered him a spot at his apartment near Grand Valley State University, where he studies political science. Together, the two attend meetings with a local group that helps men re-enter society after spending time behind bars. Growing up, Bennett never thought he had a future to look forward to. 'When I was younger, when I was gang banging, the older kids was telling me, ‘We need people in the hood to go to college to be lawyers, to be doctors,’' he said. 'But we see them, they’re not doing that. They telling us that but they still selling drugs, they still toting guns.' But now, next to his new friend and mentor, he knows he has much ahead of him. 'With so much trust and how much he believe in me,' Bennett told the paper, 'I don’t want to disappoint him.'

"North Korea has branded the U.S. 'a graveyard of human rights', as it criticised the nation in the wake of the Missouri riots following the shooting of an unarmed black teenager. China, Iran and Russia have previously criticised America   following the shooting in the town of Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, and the subsequent crackdown on protesters. North Korea, regularly condemned by Washington and others over allegations of gross human rights abuses, has now voiced its criticism of the U.S., saying it should 'mind its own business' rather than interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Scroll down for videos . A North Korean spokesman has branded the U.S. 'a graveyard of human rights' as it criticised the nation in the wake of the Missouri riots. Pictured is North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last year . A spokesman from North Korea's foreign ministry was quoted by the state-run news agency KCNA as saying the U.S. 'is indeed a country wantonly violating human rights where people are subject to discrimination and humiliation due to their race, and are in constant fear that they may get shot at any moment.' The spokesman said: 'It should not seek solutions to its problems in suppressing demonstrators, but bring to light the real picture of the American society, a graveyard of human rights, and have a correct understanding of what genuine human rights are like and how they should be guaranteed.' The spokesman went on to say: 'The U.S. had better... mind its own business, instead of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.' North Korea is estimated to have up to 120,000 political prisoners, while those caught attempting to leave the country are regularly sent to jail or face execution, according to AFP. In February, a UN inquiry into North Korea's human rights record published its findings and detailed a wide range of systemic abuses including murder, enslavement and torture. The commission concluded that many of the violations constituted crimes against humanity and suggested they could be placed before the International Criminal Court. Activists raise their hands as they demand justice for the killing of Michael Brown while marching to the Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse from City Hall in downtown St. Louis, Missouri, yesterday . The report likened North Korea's regime to Nazism and called for the International Criminal Court to close political prison camps. The use of systematic torture, starvation, and killings is akin to punishments ordered under Adolf Hitler, the report stated. 'The gravity, scale and nature of these violations revealed a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,' it said. However, North Korea rejected the report as a 'sheer fabrication' invented by the United States and its allies. In February, a UN inquiry into North Korea's human rights record published its findings and detailed a wide range of systemic abuses including murder, enslavement and torture . Earlier this month it was reported that North Korea was to publish its own report saying its human rights record is 'bright and rosy' The North's Association for Human Rights Studies said the report would counter the 'lies and fabrications' made by unspecified 'hostile forces' about the rights situation in the isolated state. The shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by a white police officer has focused global attention on the state of race relations in the U.S. and has drawn criticisms from a number of other nations. According to AFP, state media in China said that 'even in a country that has for years tried to play the role of an international human rights judge and defender, there is still much room for improvement'. A policeman tries to block an activist, who was demanding justice for the death of teenager Michael Brown, from advancing past the steps to the Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse in  St. Louis . Egypt meanwhile, where at least 1,400 people have been killed in clashes with security forces since July last year, has said police in the U.S. used 'excessive' force when dealing with protests in Ferguson following the shooting. The August 9 shooting sparked two weeks of demonstrations, some with violent clashes and scores of arrests, in which protesters demanded Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson be charged in Brown's death. Demonstrations have been more subdued for days. On Tuesday, more than 100 people marched a few blocks from St. Louis city hall to the federal court building, chanting 'fired up, fed up, time that we stand up.' The protesters, who called for Wilson's arrest and the removal of Ferguson police leaders, were blocked from walking up the courthouse steps by a group of officers, most on bicycles.","North Korea spokesman said U.S. is 'wantonly violating human rights'

"Coleen Rooney has . worked diligently to get her figure back to peak condition since the . birth of her second son in May, and the results speak for themselves. But while the 27-year-old's earlier physical transformations have largely been down to hard work in the gym, this time round Coleen has had a bit of a helping hand at a local clinic. The Liverpudlian wife of Wayne Rooney has revealed that she has been undergoing 3D lipo - a £999 treatment that claims to melt fat away. Slimmer frame: Coleen Rooney has been displaying a more svelte figure lately and now she has revealed the secret behind it: 3D lipo . The mother-of-two revealed on Twitter: 'Started my 3D lipo course today @Malinki_Brows. Thanks girls, enjoyed the treatment xx'. Her message, which has since been deleted, was retweeted by the Liverpool-based salon and uploaded to their Facebook page. The treatment, which is on offer exclusively at Malinki Cosmetics in Coleen's northern hometown, is also favoured by fellow WAG, Alex Gerrard. It combines Cavitation, which converts fat cells into liquid which can then be naturally drained by the body's own filtration system, as well as a body sculpting treatment called Cryolipolysis. Revealed: The mother-of-two revealed on Twitter: 'Started my 3D lipo course today @Malinki_Brows. Thanks girls, enjoyed the treatment xx', which Malinki salons uploaded to their Facebook page . Speaking to MailOnline, Hayley Mack, . joint salon director of Malinki Cosmetics, where Coleen has been . receiving the treatment, said: 'Coleen heard about the system through our . other clients in her circle of friends. 'She contacted us about it and we invited her in for an in-depth consultation about what she wanted to achieve. Hotting up: The 3D system heats skin up to 41 degrees and melts the fat, which is excreted through the liver. It also helps tighten the skin, claims Hayley Mack who has the device in her salon . 'She's been coming in for about four weeks now for the full treatment. 'The 3D system heats skin up to 41 degrees and melts the fat, which is excreted through the liver. It also helps tighten the skin.' The new system, which claims to give 'instant results' of 5-6cm loss per session, also maintains that there is no downtime. Dr Dennis Wolf, Cosmetic Doctor at The Private Clinic, said: 'In recent months we have seen the emergence of many non-invasive treatments such as this one. 'However, since this is a non-invasive procedure, which does not involve physically extracting the fat from the body, the operator does not have much control over how much fat is removed. 'With procedures where the fat is physically removed however, such as VASER liposuction, the surgeon has control over where, to what extent and how much fat is removed. The areas can also be contoured with extraction techniques. 'It is necessary to ask the question, ""if fat is not actually being removed from the body, where is it going?"" Blitz: The mother-of-two recently revealed she uses Technoshape - a fat-blitzing stomach belt - to rid her post baby stomach . Tweet tweet: Coleen tweeted about using the machine, which was recommended to her by personal trainer, Elise Lindsay . 'I would also advise that patients . who, like Coleen, have recently given birth, wait some time before . opting to undergo any form of procedure which seeks to target body fat. 'With pregnancy, weight gain is an inevitability and so the body needs time to re-adjust after birth. 'Diet . and exercise are, first and foremost, the most important methods of . weight loss post-pregnancy. In time, a cosmetic procedure to target . stubborn areas of excess fat may well be suitable, but I would advise . the patient to wait until their weight has stabilised before undergoing . such a procedure.' This isn't the first time that Coleen has experimented with weight loss methods to shift the pounds. In June she revealed that she got in shape for a friend's wedding by embarking on a gruelling juice diet and has also admitted to using Technoshape - a fat-blitzing stomach belt - to rid her post baby stomach after giving birth to baby Klay.

He told MailOnline: 'I used to be 17st and dropped two stone after changing my diet and cutting out carbs. But I still had fat around my middle that I couldn't shift.

Following Chris Hughton's sacking as Norwich boss a month before the end of the season, at present, not one of the 92 League clubs in England has a black manager. With a lack of black managers currently working in the English game, calls have been made for legislation to be introduced, similar to the Rooney rule in the NFL, which requires a minority candidate to be interviewed for all vacancies. However, Hasselbaink is unsure whether there is a problem without knowing just how many black managers are applying for jobs and said: 'Is there racism against black managers? I don't know how to answer that because I don't know how many black managers are applying for jobs. If a lot of black managers are applying and not getting jobs then there is a problem, but I don't know if they are. I know Chris Hughton and Paul Ince are, but not many others.' Hasselbaink is keen to return to England - his children attend school in this country - but wants to find the right club to manage. 'I am looking for the right opportunity, a club that is honest.

"Brendan Rodgers has landed his second signing of the . summer after Liverpool confirmed that midfielder Emre Can is heading for . Anfield. Sportsmail revealed how Liverpool had activated a . £9.75million (12m euro) escape clause in Can's Leverkusen contract by faxing a bid to . the Bundesliga club in the past 24 hours. The German side admitted on Wednesday night that Liverpool made their . move and that everything has been agreed for the transfer to go through. Done: Liverpool have signed Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Emre Can after activating his release clause . Signal of intent: Manager Brendan Rodgers has been busy trying to sort incomings out early on for next year . Sealed: Rickie Lambert has already secured a £4m move from Southampton this close season . The Reds released a statement on their website on Thursday morning that the deal had been done in principle subject to the completion of relevant documents. Leverkusen's chief executive Michael Schade told German . paper Bild on Wednesday that: 'Up until yesterday, I would have said it was just . rumours about Emre. 'But now I can confirm that we have received an official . offer from Liverpool, and I expect a very quick conclusion to it.' Rodgers has been chasing the Germany Under 21 international for a while . and has been over to personally check on the player's progress. The 20-year-old is an energetic box-to-box midfielder and should provide the Reds with extra impetus in the middle of the park. Inter Milan were also keen on Can - pronounced 'Chan' - but it was always his intention to move to the Premier League. The club hope to have a deal concluded within the week as they press ahead with plans for an assault on the Premier League title. The player's agent, Reza Fazeli, is a familiar face around Anfield after brokering a loan move with the club for Nuri Sahin in 2012. Rodgers is keen to get his transfer business done early. Rickie Lambert has already signed for £4million from Southampton ahead of the World Cup and they continue to pursue England midfielder Adam Lallana. They came within a slip of winning the league last month and the belief is that if they can keep hold of Luis Suarez - who was linked with a move to Real Madrid in the Spanish press on Wednesday morning - and supplement that with shrewd additions, they'll be in a better position to challenge come August. Can is one of the most versatile young players in the Bundesliga. Having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at Bayern Munich, the Frankfurt-born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age. After only four first-team appearances at Bayern, though, Can's star faded during the 2012/13 season, and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to Leverkusen. It has done him a world of good, and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club. He has also represented Germany at every level from Under 15 to Under 21. Can prefers to play in central midfield - 'either attacking or defending, I don't care either way' - but has been employed as a centre-back and a left-back on various occasions. As captain of the German Under 17s team, he was the calming influence at the heart of play. His physical strength is of particular use going forward, though he is rarely overly reckless. It has been remarked on several occasions that Can seems to have a maturity beyond his years, and his technical ability as a playmaker, either from the back or the front, is now beyond doubt. The most commonly drawn comparison is Bastian Schweinsteiger. And not only because the young Can puts as much effort into his hairstye as Schweinsteiger once did. His ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield, his dangerous shot, and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established Bayern star. For those watching his marauding runs through the centre at Leverkusen this season though, Toni Kroos has always also sprung to mind. It is little surprise that these two Bayern stars have had an influence on Can's play. He has trained with them, or at least in close proximity to them, for several of his formative years.

"Luis Suarez could yet leave Liverpool this summer after it was claimed Carlo Ancelotti has been offered the striker at Real Madrid. The Uruguayan - who hopes to be fit for this month's World Cup despite a knee injury - is Florentino Perez's top target. And the Real president has told Ancelotti that he will sanction a move should the manager want him, reports Spanish daily Marca. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez scoring a screamer for Uruguay against Japan . Wanted man: Real Madrid are planning a bid for Liverpool striker Luis Suarez this summer, according to Marca . Get it done! Real president Florentino Perez is said to have told Carlo Ancelotti he will sanction a deal . Front page news: Marca splashed on the story that Madrid are lining up the Uruguayan . Even though they beat city rivals Atletico in the Champions League final, Perez still wants to add more galaticos. Suarez is one of hottest properties on the continent and was valued at Â£79million by the CIES Football Observatory in an independent study published this week. Liverpool could stand to make a huge amount on their talisman, although it remains highly unlikely they will be forced into selling. Suarez was a standout performer for the Reds last season - finishing the Premier League's top scorer and picking up the PFA Player of the Year and Football Writers' awards. He appears to have settled on Merseyside after a tricky first season in England. While he was itching to move away last summer, Suarez seemed to be at peace as Brendan Rodgers' side battled to clinch the title and now look forward to a season of European football by virtue of their league finish in May.

"Patients who smoke or are very obese are being denied routine operations by cost-cutting NHS managers. Bosses in Northern, Eastern and Western Devon Clinical Commissioning Group said the measures are ‘urgent and necessary’ to help recover a £14.5 million debt. Under a policy to be introduced this month, morbidly obese patients will have to lose a certain amount of weight before they will be put forward for any non-urgent operations. The restrictions will apply to patients requiring non-urgent operations and are ‘urgent and necessary’ to help recover a £14.5 million debt, say hospital bosses in Devon . These patients have a body mass index of 40 or higher which is equivalent to a 6ft man weighing just over 20 stone. The CCG – which covers a population of 900,000 – has yet to decide how much weight they must lose but it could be several stone to bring them down into the ‘obese’ or ‘overweight’ range. Similarly, it is demanding that smokers give up for at least six weeks before being put on the waiting list for all non-urgent surgery. But experts accused managers of ‘prescriptively’ rationing vital treatment from patients just because of their lifestyle choices. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, pointed out that operations such as hip and knee replacements would be hugely beneficial for the obese in helping them exercise. ‘This is a prescriptive and cost-cutting measure.’ ‘Such operations would be hugely cost effective in the long term and highly beneficial for patients. ‘It’s just rationing.’ The organisation said it had no choice and needed to ensure there was enough money to care for patients during the busy winter months. But it is not the first time managers have resorted to such arbitrary measures to cut costs. Smokers will have to give up for at least six weeks before being put on the waiting list . In 2012 it emerged that a quarter of trusts were restricting at least one procedures from the obese or smokers – although in most cases it was IVF. At the time, managers pointed out that surgery can be riskier and less effective for patients who are very overweight or who smoke. They are more likely to develop potentially fatal complications as a result of the general anaesthetic including pneumonia, blood clots, heart attacks or kidney failure. Hip and knee replacements tend to be less successful in the obese and there is also evidence they benefit less from IVF. As part of its cost-cutting measures, the CCG is also making it harder for all patients to have cataract surgery or hernias removed. They will have to meet certain criteria before being eligible which might include a certain amount of sight loss or having restricted movement. Patients who have a body mass index of 40 or higher - which is equivalent to a 6ft man weighing just over 20 stone - will be targeted . Rebecca Harriott, the CCG’s chief officer, said: ‘We must act to protect essential services through our busiest winter months and ensure that care is there for our patients when they really need it,” she said. ‘The CCG has already begun to implement a series of measures designed to improve efficiency in the system and encourage patients to contribute to improving their own health outcomes. ‘These measures bring the CCG into line with similar organisations in the NHS. However, they are not enough. ‘The CCG is working up a series of measures to prioritise those patients most in need, while at the same time, increasing efficiency in the wider system – and the CCG itself.’","Morbidly obese patients will have to lose a certain amount of weight before they will be put forward for any non-urgent operations .

"The percentage of American women currently in the workforce or actively seeking work has dropped to 56.7per cent - the lowest it has been since 1988. According to new data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor participation rate of women age 16 and over in September was .2per cent lower than the rate in August. One factor responsible for the change may be that young women these days are staying in college or graduate school longer than they used to. Out of work: The percentage of American women currently in the workforce or actively seeking work has dropped to 56.7per cent - the lowest it has been since 1988 . The rate first began climbing in the 1950s, when women entered the workforce for the first time. It was at its peak in 2000 at 63per cent, and has been steadily declining ever since. Meanwhile, the rate of male labor participation was 69.1per cent in September, down from 69.2per cent in August. 'Women have begun to depart the labor force in a way that's similar to men,' Mark Hamrick, Washington, D.C. bureau chief for Bankrate.com, told Market Watch. According to Mitra Toosi, an economist for the Bureau, further education is one of the main reasons for this drop. She says that with the struggling economy, many young people are staying in school until they see an improvement. Pattern: The rate first began climbing in the 1950s, when women entered the workforce for the first time. It was at its peak in 2000 at 63per cent, and has been steadily declining ever since . And those who are going into the workforce right after college run the risk of getting laid off during cutbacks. 'During a recession, the young people are the last to be hired and the first to be fired and facing competition from more senior employees,' she explained. What's more, women dominate the fields that got hit hardest by the financial crisis; they make up nearly 60per cent of local and state government employees and 70per cent of educators. Not only are fewer women entering the workforce, but the data also showed an increase in stay-at-home moms - from 23per cent in 1999 to 29per cent i 2012. This is likely linked to the fact that childcare is the biggest household expense for many families, with the average annual cost of full-time infant care ranging from $4,863 in Mississippi to $16,430 in Massachusetts.","According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor participation rate of women 16 and over in September is at 56.7per cent .
This may be because women are staying in college longer, they dominate the fields that were hit hardest by recession, and they are choosing to be stay-at-home momes since childcare is a huge household expense ."
"A California trio consisting of a 23-year-old man, a 36-year-old woman and a teenage minor were jailed Friday on suspicion of murdering a man they initially told police was their would-be kidnapper. Police in Gardena were summoned to the scene of what callers claimed was an attempted kidnapping around 5pm Friday and found a man unconscious in a truck. The three purported victims—Jennifer Nichols, 36, Alejandro Terrazas, 23, and an unnamed 15-year-old minor—claimed they were able to get away from the man after knocking him out, reports KABC.

The unconscious man, later identified as 34-year-old Bradley Hayes of Hesperia, was taken to an area hospital as resuscitation attempts were made en route. Those attempts were unsuccessful and Hayes was soon pronounced dead. A subsequent investigation showed the trio who called police weren't telling authorities all they knew. According to Gardena Police Lt. Steve Prendergast, all four of them were acquaintances. Police believe the surviving trio assaulted the man, though their reasons remained unclear, and his injuries proved fatal. A cause of death had yet to be determined Monday pending the completion of an autopsy. The suspects, all of whom hail from the city of Hawthorn, all remained detained over the weekend. Police responded to a call to this truck in Gardena, California on Friday evening. They found 34-year-old Bradley Hayes unconscious. The trio claimed they knocked him out in self-defense but police charged them each with homicide after efforts to revive Hayes were fruitless.

"Lewis Hamilton was late for the opening practice session of the Monaco Grand Prix after he overslept. The Mercedes man, who leads the drivers' standings after four consecutive wins, was forced to dash from his boat to the Mercedes motorhome after arriving at the Monte Carlo circuit just minutes before the start of Friday's first practice session.

On track: Lewis Hamilton ended the first practice session on top of the timesheets ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg .

"A mother said she completely 'lost it' after she allegedly witnessed a paediatrician hog-tie her child during a consultation. Dr Neville Davis, 60, has pleaded not guilty to single charge of common assault arising from the alleged October 2012 incident. The mother of four, who cannot be identified, told Southport Magistrates Court on Queensland's Gold Coast during the second day of Davis's trial that she felt her then seven-year-old son had been abused during the consultation. A mother said she completely 'lost it' after she allegedly witnessed a paediatrician hog-tie her child during a consultation . The boy, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, had experienced increased behavioural problems in the build-up to the consultation. Fearing he may have had Aspergers Syndrome, the mother raised her concerns with Davis. 'Neville Davis said there was no way he could have Aspergers,' she told the court on Friday. 'He said, ""I'll prove to you that he doesn't have Aspergers Syndrome' and I said 'okay'. 'The mother claimed Davis twice tied up the child, most tightly and with his hands and ankles bound behind his back the second time. Dr Neville Davis, 60, has pleaded not guilty to single charge of common assault arising from the alleged October 2012 incident . She broke down and requested a small break when asked to describe three photos of the incident she'd taken on her mobile phone. After the boy freed himself on both occasions, the mother then claimed Davis had asked the boy to lie on his stomach and sat on his back, laughing as the boy struggled and cried out for him to get off. 'He just kept sitting there and was laughing and I was getting more agitated,' she said. 'He (Dr Davis) thought it was funny.' The mother told court: 'He [Dr Davis] said, ""I'll prove to you that he doesn't have Aspergers Syndrome' Dr Davis's lawyer Steve Zillman argued the doctor had only lightly restrained the boy and was showing the mother he didn't have Aspergers because a child with the condition would have reacted more to the restraint. Mr Zillman said the doctor had merely squatted over the boy, not sat on him, in an effort to show the mother how to calm him after a tantrum. The mother denied Mr Zillman's claims, stating adamantly Dr Davis had sat down on the boy. She also denied a suggestion a civil case against Dr Davis showed the assault claim was about seeking damages. 'This has never been about money,' she said but did confirm she was seeking damages for her son and herself from Dr Davis. The trial continues.

"Earl of Cardigan, pictured leaving court yesterday, is currently claiming benefits but has looked for work as a lorry driver, according to his mother . His privileged background provides him with a title, a stately home and a 4,000-acre country estate. Yet it appears the Earl of Cardigan is also entitled – courtesy of the taxpayer – to around £71 per week in Jobseeker’s Allowance. The aristocrat was revealed to be receiving the state benefit at his latest court appearance over a long-running feud with estate trustees. The 60-year-old earl, full name David Michael James Brudenell-Bruce, had been due to stand trial after denying damaging six pheasant feeders worth £66 and the theft of a battery and electrical power unit worth £80. The offences were said to have happened at his Savernake Estate, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, which has been in his family for almost 1,000 years. The troubled aristocrat claims to live there with rain coming in through the roof, no hot water, unsafe electrics and with heating confined to a single room after falling out with trustees in 2007 resulting in a reduced income. The Old Etonian claims he must visit the public baths in Marlborough to take a hot shower and goes to bed fully clothed wearing a hat to keep warm. The descendant of the man who led the Charge of the Light Brigade, the earl is at loggerheads with the trustees of his country pile. He took one of them, his former friend John Moore, to the High Court accusing him of selling family portraits without his permission, but lost the case. Their continued dispute, said to date back to 2007, has left him broke, he says. Yesterday at Swindon Crown Court he was bound over in the sum of £200 to keep the peace – meaning the prosecution will probably drop all charges if he causes no trouble for a year. Lord Cardigan, pictured with wife Joanne outside Tottenham House, part of his huge Savernake Estate, near Marlborough, receives about £71 a week in Job Seekers' Allowance . The Earl of Cardigan lost a legal battle this month with his trustees over the sale of ancestral portraits . Old Etonian David Brudenell-Bruce is . descendant of the 7th Earl who famously led the disastrous British . cavalry charge of the 600 in 1854 against the Russians in the Crimean . War. Their title goes back . to 1611 when James I created the Baronetage of England and offered . titles to 200 men to help with the settlement of Ireland. They have lived on the same estate in Wiltshire for 1,000 years. They rode 'into the jaws of Death, into the mouth of Hell', wrote Tennyson in his poem commemorating the suicidal attack. An . appalling series of misunderstandings led to the Brigade advancing down . a different valley from the one commander-in-chief, Lord Raglan, had . intended when he dictated ambiguous orders for Lord Lucan, the cavalry . commander. Despite the . fact that the order seemed to demand the cavalry to attack the Russian . artillery without infantry support - in contravention of all accepted . laws of military practice - an incredulous Lucan passed the instructions . on to the Earl of Cardigan, who commanded the Light Brigade, and the . troops advanced. 664 men took part and 110 were left dead. Claire Marlow, prosecuting, said: . ‘These offences are generally of a nuisance and aimed at disrupting the . workings of the trustees and the estate.’ Mike Pulsford, defending, said the . earl was maintaining his innocence but agreed to be bound over, adding: . ‘There is a Chancery Court application by my client to remove the two . trustees from the Savernake Estate.’ Mr Pulsford told the court that the earl is unemployed and has been receiving Jobseeker’s Allowance. ‘He is not working. One of his claims against the trustees is that they have withheld certain monies from him,’ he said. Last week, the earl, whose daughter . Catherine is pop singer Bo Bruce, was acquitted by magistrates of . assaulting Mr Moore and criminal damage. Outside court yesterday, the earl, . who was accompanied by his second wife, Joanne, and her mother, said . this case was the 14th set of allegations made against him during his . long-running dispute. ‘Most of them have been dismissed by the police as . being too absurd. ‘The battery I am accused of stealing is still sitting at the bottom of my garden, exactly where it was when this case started. ‘This is the most stupid of many stupid charges the police and Crown Prosecution Service have brought against me. 'What would I want with a used car battery that doesn’t even fit in my car? 'The gamekeeper had removed all the good pheasant feeders and left only the broken ones. 'Those are the ones I was accused of breaking further.’ The earl said the proceedings in the Chancery Court were about removing Mr Moore, a barrister’s clerk, as a trustee. ‘I will not rest until I have removed him from his position. Even if it takes me the rest of my life, that man will go.’ Bitter row: Lord Cardigan was friends with estate trustee John Moore (right) but their relationship has descended into a series of legal disputes .

"Ian Holloway was biting his tongue in a manful effort not to say anything controversial. But in the end, a moment of silence spoke louder than words. 'Did Watford play very well? Honestly, yes they did,' he began. 'Did they defend well? Yep, we made them. Did we attack quite well? Yep. Did we play quite well? Yep. 'Did the ref have a good game?' It was at this point Holloway tailed off. Ian Holloway was disappointed with several of referee Bobby Madley's decisions during his side's defeat . The Millwall manager had spent the previous 10 minutes treading very carefully, openly admitting that any overt criticism of referee Bobby Madley would result in his bank account being debited. Payee: The FA. Dancing around the controversial issues in front of the microphones has become an essential skill for any manager and Holloway produced a masterclass worthy of Strictly. The contingent of nearly 2,000 Millwall fans sang '3-1 to the referee' as Madley whistled the end of a contest that saw Watford return to the top of the Championship. Holloway let their annoyance flow through him. Matej Vydra fires past Millwall keeper David Forde to draw level after the visitors had scored early on . 'Football fans are usually quite accurate, aren't they?' he said. He was aggrieved that his bustling forward Ricardo Fuller had been denied a penalty when Joel Ekstrand challenged him in the box, moments before Watford scored at the other end with a contentious free-kick. Millwall captain Alan Dunne had collided with Troy Deeney on the edge of the box and the decision could really have gone either way. Dunne was booked and Daniel Tozser smashed home the resulting set-piece. Daniel Tozser smashes home a free-kick, but Holloway was annoyed by a missed foul in the build-up . Tozser celebrates in front of the Watford faithful after firing his side 2-1 in front . 'I thought my team came and played very well and how we've lost by two goals, I really don't know,' Holloway said. 'If I say what I feel, I'll probably get fined. I really don't want to pay because a referee has not done his job. I don't want to pay for my opinion on it.' Five minutes later, he concluded with: 'Have I said that the referee is bad in his role? No' and exited stage left. Well, he'd said just about everything but. Madley's performance aside, it would be harsh to say Watford were undeserving of victory. Their classy performances on the field this season have made light of their managerial merry-go-round. Huddersfield Town continued their rise up the Championship table with an eye-catching 3-0 home win over Nottingham Forest. Joel Lynch needed just 43 seconds to score against his former club, before Nahki Wells and Grant Holt struck to condemn the early pace-setters to a ninth game without a win. Forest manager Stuart Pearce said: ‘Collectively, we’re a little too easy to play against.’ Watching Deeney, Matej Vydra and the other buzzing Hornets is to wonder whether quick-fire changes in command are a good thing. Czech Vydra was exceptional once again. After scoring 22 times in 47 matches during his first loan spell from Udinese in 2012-2013, he has seven already this time round and must surely make permanent his move to England. Watford resembled the Italian club in a replica of their black-and-white strip from 1914 as Vicarage Road remembered the fallen with a spectacular 'red poppy' display in the stands and the playing of the Last Post on the pitch. And Vydra's first-half strike — a deft flick from a Keith Andrews ball — to cancel out Martyn Woolford's opener will stick in the memory, too. Gianni Munari made sure of victory in the second half and the midfielder on loan from Parma echoed his manager Slavisa Jokanovic in saying there was more to come. 'We can get better. There are a lot of games still to play, but if we fight like today we will have a successful season,' he said. Former Chelsea player Jokanovic has an air of permanence after a turbulent start to the season that saw Beppe Sannino fall out with the board, Oscar Garcia quit for health reasons and Billy McKinlay sacked after just eight days at the helm. One of six teams who could have ended the afternoon in top spot, Watford seized their opportunity and even Holloway was deferential. 'Try and keep your head on it and keep going,' he advised. 'Good luck to you.' WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE.. Cardiff's revival under Russell Slade continued with a 3-1 win over Leeds, their third victory in four games under the new manager. Shrewsbury's Andy Mangan, who scored against Chelsea in midweek, was at it again with a stunning volley in their 2-1 win at Dagenham. Spare a thought for the Carlisle fans who made the 696-mile round trip to Portsmouth only to see their side behind after just 80 seconds. Pompey won 3-0.

"Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon   vowed to finish the job of winning independence today after the SNP confirmed she would be the next party leader. Ms Sturgeon will be the only candidate to succeed Alex Salmond at the party’s conference next month, the SNP confirmed. After taking over as SNP leader she will become Scotland's First Minister in Holyrood shortly after. Ms Sturgeon said her ‘immediate focus’ will be to force Westminster to honour its pledge to hand extra powers to Scotland, following last month’s referendum. But she said: ‘I believe we will become an independent country. I believe that will be well within my lifetime.’ Scotland's next First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be the only candidate to succeed Alex Salmond at the SNP's conference next month . She said ‘circumstances and public opinion’ would decide when another Scottish independence referendum would take place. ‘It's people who will decide if and when there's another independence referendum, not politicians. ‘But circumstances and public opinion will determine whether people want to have another opportunity to choose independence in a referendum.’ She said for there to be another referendum the SNP ‘would have to offer that in a manifesto and be elected with a majority’. Ms Sturgeon's new role will not be officially confirmed until the SNP conference next month, and her appointment as First Minister will be approved by the Scottish Parliament, with the assent of the Queen, shortly after that. She will become Scotland's fifth First Minister since Holyrood was set up in 1999, and will also be the first woman to take on the top job. The SNP today angrily rejected comparisons between Nicola Sturgeon and Margaret Thatcher . Mr Salmond announced his intention to step down as both SNP leader and First Minister after last month's referendum saw Scotland reject independence and vote to remain in the United Kingdom. Despite being the first female First Minister there is ‘absolutely no similarity between Nicola Sturgeon and Margaret Thatcher’, the Scottish National Party's Westminster leader has said. Angus Robertson took offence at Scotland Minister David Mundell's suggestion that the new SNP leader was like the former prime minister in being a female leader of her party. Mr Robertson said new Scottish first minister Ms Sturgeon will be leading Scotland's most popular party whereas the former Tory leader destroyed her party in the country. He said Mr Mundell was ‘living proof’ of Mrs Thatcher's effect on her party in Scotland - he is currently the Tories' only Scottish MP. Mr Mundell had echoed Mr Robertson's congratulations for Ms Sturgeon, telling the Commons: ‘Can I join you in congratulating Nicola Sturgeon on emulating Margaret Thatcher and becoming the female leader of her party? ‘I most certainly look forward to working with her as the first female first minister of Scotland and my experience of Nicola Sturgeon previously is that she has adopted a constructive approach to discussions with the UK Government.’ Mr Robertson replied: ‘I'm sure you wouldn't want to be creating a false impression. There is absolutely no comparison between Nicola Sturgeon and Margaret Thatcher. ‘Nicola Sturgeon will be leading the most popular political party in Scotland. ‘Margaret Thatcher destroyed the Tory Party and you are the living proof - they have only one seat in Scotland.’","Alex Salmond's long-serving number two only candidate to succeed him .

"Danny Welbeck is a major injury doubt ahead of England’s opening group game against Italy after limping out of training on Tuesday. Welbeck pulled up midway through the 90 minute session based on team shape ahead of Saturday’s clash with Cesare Prandelli’s side. The England winger, who is a firm selection favourite with England head coach Roy Hodgson, appears to have a hamstring strain. Blow: Danny Welbeck could miss England's first game against Italy after limping out of training with an injury . Tanning: Welbeck, Chris Smalling and Jordan Henderson mobbed on the beach in Rio . He left the training ground with blue tape on the inside of his thigh after undergoing treatment with England head physio Gary Lewin. Hodgson also revealed that the players have started practising penalties and they were taken without a keeper during yesterday’s session. England’s players were asked to nominate a spot in the goal and had to shoot through hoops as part of the drill which is believed to have involved every squad member. Welbeck’s chances of starting against Italy in Manaus appear to rest on whether the Manchester United forward can train fully in the next two days. Hodgson worked on England’s attacking play during the session and trialled Raheem Sterling in the No10 role behind Daniel Sturridge for much of it. The Liverpool flyer also played right and left as Hodgson tinkered with his team shape in training.  Adam Lallana and now James Milner are also in the hunt to play alongside Wayne Rooney and Sturridge in an attacking England formation. Hodgson is clearly tempted to start Sterling against Italy on Saturday and insists it wouldn’t be a risk to play him. He has played just 39 minutes of football in the last five weeks and was sent off during England’s friendly with Ecuador during the team’s stopover in Miami. Mover: Welbeck finds himself getting involved with some Capoeria dancers on Monday . SAMBA!  Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge with Brazilian dancers in Rio . Hodgson added: ‘He’s as fit as a flea and I’m pretty certain that he hasn’t forgotten how to play matches either. ‘It was unfortunate that he couldn’t play the game, but I can tell you that Raheem Sterling is very much in the group of players I’m considering. ‘If I select him, it won’t be in my opinion a risk that he hasn’t played so many minutes. ‘And if I don’t select him, it certainly won’t be because he has only played 39 minutes. ‘It will be because I prefer someone else. That’s all I can tell you.’ Hodgson also revealed that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is making progress and should be fit for England’s second group game against Uruguay on June 19 in Sao Paolo. Yesterday the England forward trained without a knee brace but is not yet able to take part in contact practice matches. Hodgson added: ‘It looks very unlikely that we’ll replace him. I don’t think that will be the case. I’m not a doctor I can’t give you real up to date or detailed information about where it is. ‘He has got a strained (right) medial ligament, that we do know. But he is certainly working very hard and I don’t think he could be further forward in terms of his progression than he is now. He’s well up there.’ On the return: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is working his way back to full fitness . Relaxed: Roy Hodgson is relatively calm as England's build-up to their first game gathers pace . England’s players and staff have also started taking a course of anti-malaria tablets as they prepare to fly to Manaus on Thursday. Hodgson, who decided not take the tablets when he flew to the jungle region in December, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned, I’ve got to go with medical opinion. ‘If the doctors are telling me that when we go to Manaus, the players must take malaria tablets, whether it has side-effects or not, what do I do? ‘I can’t turn around and say “We will not take malaria tablets”, because the bottom line is better stomach cramps or whatever it is for one player in ten than have someone contract malaria because that would be unthinkable.’","Welbeck is a major injury doubt for England's World Cup opener after limping out of training .

"Arsenal will ramp up their search for a new central defender during a scouting meeting next week. The Gunners are committed to bolstering their defensive options in January as fears grow over the lack of quality cover in the heart of their back four. Gunners spies have been identifying targets for several months, with their findings due to be discussed in the coming days. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Premier League Preview: Swansea vs Arsenal . Chris Smalling is among the names to be discussed during a scouting meeting this week . Vlaar (right) is out of contract with Villa in the summer and has also attracted interest from Manchester United . Arsenal want a clear strategy in place in their attempts to land a new defender when the January window opens. Renewed moves for Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk, Aston Villa skipper Ron Vlaar and Manchester United central defender Chris Smalling will be weighed up. All three interested Arsene Wenger during the final days of the transfer window following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona. Vlaar, who is also on Manchester United’s radar, could be available in a cut-price deal with his current contract due to expire at the end of the season. Arsenal tested the water with a £7million swoop for Van Dijk on transfer deadline day, while Arsenal wanted to take Smalling as part of a United’s failed move for Vermaelen. Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker are the club’s only two senior central defenders following Vermaelen’s exit. But Koscielny’s achilles injury has seen left-back Nacho Monreal play as a makeshift central defender in recent weeks. Arsene Wenger has been forced to use Nacho Monreal at centre back in recent weeks . Laurent Koscielny will be out of the game against Hull this weekend with an achilles problem . Tuesday’s Champions League capitulation against Anderlecht underlined the club’s need to reinforce their defence in January, but Wenger, who has been criticised for his failure to replace Vermaelen, will look to solve the problem in the next transfer window. Arsenal will also be in the market for a defensive central midfielder in January.

"For a week away skiing with the family Bulgaria is where Britons will find the best value while Austria's St Anton will hit the budget hardest. Bulgaria's Bansko topped a poll of 42 European ski centres that factored in average hotel, ski pass, ski hire, ski lesson, evening meals and drinks for over the course of seven days for a family of four. In Bansko, southwestern Bulgaria, the whole package costs £1,631 compared while for a similar break in St Anton the cost was more than three times as high at £5,026, according to a new survey by Tripadvisor. Bansko in Bulgaria is the best value ski resort for a family of four according to a TripAdvisor study . Bansko came out on top in a comparison factoring in travel, hotel, ski passes and lessons, meals and drinks . After Bansko, the next best-value spot on average in the period from December 15 to April 15 next year was Spain's Sierra Nevada, where costs totalled £1,930, followed by host of the Winter Olympic Games Sochi in Russia (£2,205), . Next on the list is Berchtesgarden in Germany (£2,476) and Ordino Arcalis in Andorra (£2,504). Four of the 10 most expensive resorts were in Switzerland, with the country's St Moritz the second most pricey centre at £4,811. Next was Val d'Isere in France (£4,606) followed by Zermatt in Switzerland (£4,572) and Val Thorens in France (£4,565). Sochi in Russia hit the world stage with the 2014 Winter Olympics and is now Europe's third best value resort . The Sierra Nevada mountain range in Spain comes in second for cheap family ski and boarding breaks . Andorra comes in as the most affordable country, with four of its destinations in the top 10 for best family. St Anton's place on the list is decided most significantly by its high price for hotels, St. Anton, Austria has the most expensive average rate for a week’s stay, coming in at £3,424. For the price of a week in a hotel in St. Anton, a family of four can have almost five weeks in a Sierra Nevada hotel in Spain (£725 a week). Austria's St Anton came out the most expensive out of the 42 European ski centres surveyed . TripAdvisor spokesman James Kay said: 'Skiing can be an expensive holiday, especially for a family of four, but our survey shows that by carefully choosing the resort, costs can be dramatically reduced. 'This year, Eastern European destinations and Andorra are where families will find the best value for money.' St Anton's place on the top of the most expensive list comes almost entirely because of its high hotel prices, with an average stay setting a family back £3,425. For that price a family could enjoy almost five weeks in Sierra Nevada which at £726-a-week is the cheapest accommodation in the best value top 10. Prices for ski holidays can be sky high but shopping around can pay dividends, says TripAdvisor's James Kay . A week in St Anton could cost skiing families as much as £5,026, three times Bansko's total of £1,631 . Bansko is also a big winner for beer lovers, with a local beer a day for two adults costing £19 - the next cheapest can be found in Andorra’s Ordino Arcalis for £22. The Bulgarian resort also has the cheapest dining (a basic meal a day for the four-member family for the purposes of the survey) with £102 compared to £642 in St Moritz. For the cheapest ski lessons head to Formigal, Spain, where a lesson for two adults and two children comes in at £40, significantly better value than anywhere else with the closest competition found in Andorra’s Ordino Arcalis and Arinsal. For the crème de la crème of lessons in Europe head to Flims Laax Falera, Switzerland, where kids and adults can learn to ride the slopes for £322 in total.","Bansko in Bulgaria comes out the cheapest for a family ski holiday in Europe .

"Plastic road markers may have been responsible for the crash that killed Paul Walker, his family believes. The Fast And Furious actor's family have reportedly spoken to stunt experts who have claimed that the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT driven by the star's friend careered out of control after hitting the markers - called Botts' Dots. According to TMZ, sources close to his family said that having visited the site, the experts said that the bumps may have caused the car to hydroplane, causing the driver to lose control. Actor Walker and driver Roger Rodas died on November 30 when their car hit a pole and tree and caught fire in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita. Paul Walker's family have claimed that experts have said that road markers called Bott's Dots (circled) may have been the cause of the crash that killed him . Total devastation: There was little left of the wreckage after impact, with investigators ruling that speed and not a mechanical fault was to blame for the tragedy . They told the family that the car could have lost traction after hitting the bumps, which are used to separate lanes of traffic, and skidded off the road. The claims come after question marks were raised over the safety of the car itself following the crash. The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Roger Rodas when it crashed in Los Angeles, killing both of them. It has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light carbon-fibre frame and 5.7 litre race-derived V10 engine. It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models. Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity . when they launched the model in 2004. According to TMZ, a memo . circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot . drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.' The actor's family claims that experts say the crash could have been caused by Botts' Dots in the road - raised plastic markers that separate traffic lanes . His final moments: The heartthrob is pictured in the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT just moments before it careered off the road and hit a tree and a pole, killing him and driver Roger Rodas in a fiery explosion . 'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.) 'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar. According to the California Department of Transportation, Botts' Dots were invented by Dr Elbert D Botts as a way of making the painted lines that separate lanes in the road last longer. The plastic raised bumps were eventually made mandatory in California and have since become popular on roads across the world. There are 20million Botts' Dots on Californian roads. The dots also alert drivers when they drift out of their lane. Police have revealed that a second man has been charged with stealing a piece of the wreckage of the Porsche that Walker was a passenger in when he was killed. Anthony Janow, 25, was released on $60,000 bail following the charges. Prosecutors say that Janow and 18-year-old Jameson Witty stole a roof panel from the wreck as it was being towed away from the site. The pair could face up to four-and-a-half years in prison for the offence. Witty, who is also free on bail, was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and afterwards he even bragged about the heist by posting pics of the stolen wreckage on Instagram. The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed. The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police. The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft. Walker became famous for his starring role in the Fast And Furious franchise . A search warrant was executed on Thursday, and police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof. Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intensions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it. Paul was a childhood idol to me and many. The investigation into the crash that killed both Walker and Rodas is still ongoing.","The actor's family claim that Botts' Dots may have been cause of crash .

"Beer, or at least one of its ingredients, could boost brain function, a new study has found. But a leisurely pint is unlikely to have any intellectual benefit, because a person would need to drink the equivalent of 3,520 pints (2,000 litres) a day to stand any chance of boosting their cognitive abilities. Researchers demonstrated that xanthohumol – a type of flavonoid found in hops and beer - improved cognitive function in young mice. Line them up: A new study has found that drinking beer could make people and animals smarter, but humans would have to drink 3,520 pints (2,000 litres) of beer to stand any chance of booting their cognitive abilities - which the scientist's don't recommend . Flavonoids are compounds found in plants that often give them their colour and scientists have been studying them in blueberries, dark chocolate and red wine to uncover any potential benefits that could help fight cancer and heart disease, for example. Scientists hope that xanthohumol could be used to treat metabolic syndrome, a condition associated with obesity and high blood pressure, as well as age-related deficits in memory. The rare micronutrient is found in the hops, commonly used to make beer. Experts at Oregon State University (OSU) believe they have taken a step to understanding the degradation of memory that happens with age in many mammals, including humans, because no effect was seen in older mice used in the study. A recipe for intelligence? Researchers have demonstrated that Xanthohumol – a type of flavonoid found in hops (pictured) and beer - improve cognitive function in young mice . Researchers have demonstrated that Xanthohumol – a type of flavonoid found in hops and beer - improved cognitive function in young mice. Scientists think that xanthohumol could be used to treat metabolic syndrome, a condition associated with obesity and high blood pressure, as well as age-related deficits in memory. Last week, hops - a key ingredient in beer - have been harvested from London's first hop farm in over 100 years. Meantime Brewery's Urban Hop Farm is based in Greenwich on the banks of the Thames and the hops picked will be used to make a beer designed to reflect the taste of the capital - rather than scientific research. They studied xanthohumol in high dosages - beyond what would be naturally ingested as part of a normal diet - and found that it appears to enhance young animals’ ability to adapt to changes in their environment. The cognitive flexibility of the mice was tested with a specially designed maze and younger mice showed signs of intellectual improvement. The levels of xanthohumol used in the study were only possible using supplements, so that if a human was to stand any chance of seeing positive cognitive effects, they would have to drink ‘2,000 litres of beer a day to reach the xanthohumol levels we used in this research,’ the experts said. ‘Xanthohumol can speed the metabolism, reduce fatty acids in the liver and, at least with young mice, appeared to improve their cognitive flexibility, or higher level thinking,’ Daniel Zamzow, a former OSU doctoral student said. ‘Unfortunately it did not reduce palmitoylation [a normal biological process] in older mice, or improve their learning or cognitive performance, at least in the amounts of the compound we gave them,’ Dr Zamzow, who is now a lecturer at the University of Wisconsin/Rock County, added. Kathy Magnusson, a professor at OSU, said: ‘This flavonoid [xanthohumol] and others may have a function in the optimal ability to form memories.’ ‘Part of what this study seems to be suggesting is that it’s important to begin early in life to gain the full benefits of healthy nutrition.’ Xanthohumol - in hops - is of particular interest because scientists think it would be used to treat metabolic syndrome, a condition associated with obesity and high blood pressure, as well as age-related deficits in memory. Here, volunteers pick hops at the first hop farm based in London for over 100 years .","Researchers have demonstrated that Xanthohumol - a type of flavonoid found in hops and beer - improved cognitive function in young mice .

"Nick Clegg today refused to back George Osborne’s demand for massive cuts in the welfare bill, arguing parents aged under-25 should not be banned from claiming housing benefit. The Liberal Democrat leader said he would ‘knock on the head’ the idea of Conservative plans for a £10billion cut to the welfare budget. But he said he was open to the idea of some limits on housing benefit, putting himself at odds with Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes who said last night: ‘We’ve not signed up to cutting housing benefit and I don’t imagine for a moment we will.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today ruled out banning under-25s from claiming housing benefit, after meeting with U2 frontman Bono yesterday to discuss global poverty . Mr Clegg was taking questions from voters in Sheffield, where he is an MP, the day after meeting U2 frontman Bono to discuss tackling poverty. Chancellor George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary this week set out plans to cut the benefits bill by a further £10billion. And in his conference speech, David Cameron said he wanted to ‘look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25’. But Mr Clegg said he could ‘knock both ideas on the head.’ ‘The idea that of that £16billion [welfare budget] we are just going to scoop out £10billion from welfare which will inevitably hit the poorest before asking anything of the wealthiest, no. Flatly no. Of course not. ‘What I am looking for is as the country unfortunately has to carry on tightening our belts for some time in the future, who should tighten their belts first. ‘I just start from the very simple principle that when we are all having to make sacrifices you ask people at the top and then work down you don’t ask people at the bottom and work up,’ he told BBC Radio 5Live. But Mr Clegg admitted it was ‘unrealistic’ to think that no savings could be made from welfare. Limiting housing benefit was a key policy announcement at the Tory conference in Birmingham this week. David Cameron used his speech at the Tory party conference this week to argue under-25s should not receive housing benefit . Mr Cameron said: ‘If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don’t?’ But Mr Clegg ruled out a ‘complete blanket ban on providing housing benefit to anyone who so happens to  have been born 25 years ago or less’. He said parents aged under-25 should be allowed to continue to claim state help with housing costs. ‘Because there are people who have got kids, who have suffered abuse, who have suffered terrible trauma in their families, who of course as a passionate society we have got to support them. ‘But do I think there might be some under-25-year-olds who don’t need all the support they get in the same way that under-25-year-olds who aren’t on housing benefit have to make their way... ‘Do I think we need to look for further savings in welfare, unambiguously yes.’ However, last night Mr Hughes vowed to block any Tory plans to remove housing benefit from those aged under-25. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time last night, he said: 'It is not a done deal across the Coalition and I would not agree to it as proposed – I’m very clear about that. 'Are you really saying we should be depriving a 23-year-old mum of the money she needs to keep the roof over the head of her two-year-olds? 'I’m for collecting more money from the people who are very well-off in this country. Let’s collect money from people who can afford to pay, not take money from youngsters who are struggling with all the other pressures.' Mr Hughes, who does not sit around the Cabinet table but is on the back benches, said his party leader agreed that the plans had to be blocked. 'Nick does agree with me,' he said. 'We’ve not signed up to cutting housing benefit and I don’t imagine for a moment we will.'","Deputy Prime Minister says he will 'knock on the head' Tory plans for tough cuts to welfare .

We wanted the facilities, we wanted to be away from England together in a foreign country. ‘We wanted to come to a country where there is at least a good chance that the sun will shine, because it will shine in Brazil. ‘But we weren’t 100 per cent dependant on that because we were going to prepare the players to be, as the sports science people have termed it, comfortable with the uncomfortable. ‘And that means playing in temperatures that make you feel uncomfortable. ‘But even if the weather got colder here, all we would do is put more clothes on and make them feel uncomfortable that way. ‘Today the players were pretty anxious to take their tops off when they were given permission to do so because they were beginning to sweat a lot and feel uncomfortable.'

He's training very very well and it looks like he might be taking part even before the end of this week.' Hodgson feels the competition for places in the squad, which will be reduced to a confirmed final 23 before England head to Brazil, has ensured the players take their training especially seriously.But while relaxation is not an option, he insists he is leading a 'happy' camp. Hodgson added: 'We don't talk about relaxation, or about sessions being light-hearted or serious, we talk about the job that we need to do and we expect that every time the players go onto the training ground that they are 100 per cent following what we think needs to be done.

'If they happen to enjoy it then that's a major bonus but we don't set out to make it enjoyable, we set out to do the work that we think is absolutely necessary if we're to have any success at this World Cup.' Hodgson made some tough calls before revealing his first selection - his decision to include Southampton teenager Luke Shaw instead of 107-time international left-back Ashley Cole was hotly debated.

'So in this camp of course there's a lot of enthusiasm but they're also happy that they are taking part in this incredible adventure and that they're the ones who are going to be leading England over the next few weeks.'

Big things are expected from the Manchester United striker in South America, but should he flounder at the tournament then Hodgson insists it will not be 'for the want of trying'. He said: 'He knows what a good player he is, he knows the eyes, certainly of England, if not the rest of the world, are going to be on him and he'll do everything he can to make certain he brings out his best qualities. 'He spent his week off here in Portugal and he trained during that time. He said to me, 'When you arrive on Monday, I'll meet you there and I want to be 100 percent ready to train from the first day'. 'He's a bit disappointed because I decided to leave him out of the exercise I was doing, which involved a lot of shooting, because I wanted to protect his thigh.

"A 26-year-old man left unable to speak and 'too angry to work' after a head-on car crash has been awarded £4million after an eight-year legal battle. Paul Vallance suffered a serious brain injury at the age of 18 after a driver lost control and ploughed into his car in Wiltshire, but doctors did not realise the full extent of it for years. The debilitating brain damage was dismissed as a ‘mild head injury’ and when he returned to work he lost  a series of jobs because of his sudden bursts of anger with customers. Paul Vallance suffered a serious brain injury at the age of 18 after a driver lost control and ploughed into his car in Wiltshire, but doctors did not realise the full extent of it for years. Mr Vallance's undiagnosed brain injury left him unable to exercise self-control or use appropriate language and he was regularly fired for losing his temper. His mother Tina, said: 'My loving son had been replaced by a much angrier, hostile young man. 'He would spend hours just staring at himself in a mirror, saying repeatedly 'I look like Paul, but I don't feel like Paul'. 'My heart was in bits seeing him like he was back then. 'Several retail positions followed in quick succession but Paul just couldn't cope. He spent 19 days in hospital after the 2006 crash which happened on the B4192 (pictured)  between Chilton Foliat and the turning for Ramsbury near his  home in Marlborough . His mother Tina said her son was  replaced by a much angrier, hostile young man and he was fired from a string of different jobs . He spent 19 days in hospital after the 2006 crash which happened on a country lane near his home in Marlborough. The former trainee manager physically recovered from a broken leg, shoulder and nose but also suffered from amnesia, lost the ability to speak and was confused. Those classic signs of a serious brain injury were missed when the insurance companies first dealt with his compensation claim months later. His mother said her son dramatically changed in the weeks and months after the crash. When he began to string words together again, his language was aggressive and abusive. She instructed a different law firm to get a fresh compensation case started - one which was not appointed by his car insurers and did not dismiss his 'mild head injury'. It wasn't until that law firm, Novum Law, commissioned proper brain scans that it became apparent Paul had suffered serious damage to the frontal lobe of his brain. He had suffered a cerebral oedema, intra-cranial hematoma and subdural haemorrhage, all of which damaged his emotional control and executive functioning. This had left him with behavioural difficulties and anger management issues. Specialist brain injury lawyer Huw Ponting took Mr Vallance's case to the High Court, where the £4million pay-out has now been agreed. Mr Ponting said: 'The collision has had a significant impact on Paul's life and family. 'A whole eight years' on from the accident, he continues to suffer from the effects of the severe traumatic brain injury he sustained, affecting all aspects of his life. 'For a young man to be faced with the prospect of never being able to work again or live independently without support is unimaginable. 'We are thrilled to have secured justice for Paul which will help finance the specialist care and support that he will need for the rest of his life.' Paul is now in a specialist care unit in Wigan in Lancashire.","Paul Vallance suffered a serious brain injury after a car crash in 2006 .

"Identified: The 'Forest Boy' who said he lived in a German wood for five years is actually Dutch and only left home five days before his 'discovery' The English-speaking 'Forest Boy' who said he lived in a German wood for five years is actually Dutch and only left home five days before his 'discovery', it has been claimed. German police said the man's stepmother had identified the 'boy', who had called himself 'Ray' and said he had been living rough with his father in the wilderness before wandering into Berlin in September, as being called  Robin van Helsum. He is 20-years-old, and not 17 as he had previously stated, and went missing from his home in Hengelo, near the Germany city of Gronau, less than one week before he told his story. Friends also said he left home because of 'personal problems' and to 'start a new life'. Officers said Robin's family identified him from pictures released earlier this week. A source said: 'We have spoken to his family and his friends and we have seen a photo where he has a chain with his name on which confirms who he is. 'This was a mystery for us and we are pleased that it has been solved.' A Hengelo police spokesman added: 'We are very happy that he's been found. 'We are 100 per cent certain that we are dealing with the 20-year-old boy, who his stepmother unambiguously identified.' And they warned that, if the incident proves to be a hoax, then Robin may face a substantial legal bill for wasting police time. Police spokesman Michael Maass told Die Welt: 'It was a really frustrating case and took up a lot of time. That will have to be paid for and that will eventually end up at his door.' 'It's not longer a joke. If the story is made up then he deliberately took us for fools, and he could be liable for the costs.' Police had already worked out that the boy was not a native English speaker and estimated that he was about 17. But he had refused to allow his photo to be issued to the world which meant that officials had not been able to come further in identifying him. According to German news agency DPA, . Robin VH was last seen in Hengelo on September 2, 2011, ahead of taking a . trip to Berlin with a friend. This was just days before he appeared at the city hall as 'Forest Boy'. Possessions: Ray's rucksack, which was on him when he was found . Equipment: The boy, who called himself Ray, (right) was carrying a sleeping bag (left) More pictures have emerged of Robin since his unmasking . A school friend told Dutch broadcaster NOS: 'I am certain that is Robin. He had personal problems and that was his way of beginning a new life.' Earlier this week, German police released the first picture of 'Forest Boy'. They had been unable to identify him . since he emerged in the German capital last September, and issued his . picture in a bid to jog people's memory and maybe throw up some leads. The 'boy' said his father called him . 'Ray' and that he was born June 20, 1994, but claimed not to know his . last name or where he is from. He said his mother, Doreen, died in a car accident when he was 12 and after that he and his father, Ryan, took to the forest. Accommodation: The tent which Ray was apparently using when he was in the woods . Left without a word: The house of the father of the 'forest boy Ray' in Hengelo, the Netherlands . ROC Twente, the school where 'forest boy Ray' studied in Hengelo: Friends there told Dutch media that he had personal problems and his disappearance and reappearance was 'his way of starting a new life . They wandered using maps and a compass, staying in tents or caves overnight, he added. And he told authorities that after his father died in August 2011, he buried him in the forest and then walked five days north before ending up in Berlin, and showed up at city hall. Investigators had been unable to confirm any details about a fatal car accident that matched up with Ray's story, however, and weren't able to find the body of the father - raising 'serious doubts' about the story.

"An ice cream man caught with a cache of weapons hidden inside his van told police he needed the knives to open boxes of chocolate flakes. Grant Minchion, 23, was keeping nunchucks - a type of martial arts weapon - a throwing knife, lock knife and Stanley knife in the vehicle. When police stopped the van on October 14, Minchion claimed to have been given the throwing knife - which he said was useful for opening boxes of flakes - by a 'kid' in exchange for a Cornetto ice cream. Ice cream man, Grant Minchion (pictured), was caught with a cache of weapons hidden inside his van - and told police he needed the knives to open boxes of chocolate flakes . Alison Warburton, prosecuting, said: 'During the course of a search, police found a lock knife in a draw with money. 'The nunchucks were in the glovebox and knives in a sink behind the driver. The defendant was arrested and interviewed. 'Regarding the nunchucks, he said ""I wouldn't know what to call them but I know what they are"". 'He said they belonged to someone else - an 18-year-old male - and the other male had brought them into the van in April because he was being bullied.

"I was 38 when I finally hung up my boots, so I marvel at the longevity of Manchester United’s Ryan Giggs, the Peter Pan of football. Sir Stanley Matthew played till he was 50, and Giggs is the modern-day equivalent. As you get towards the end of your career, you need sheer bloody-mindedness to carry on. There is an element of not wanting to let go, and there is always a new generation of players coming along. You don’t want to miss out. VIDEO Scroll down for Giggs: Job has helped prepare me for after my playing career . End of an era: Ryan Giggs has retired from football after being confirmed as Manchester United's new assistant manager under Louis van Gaal . Winner: Giggs, pictured here winning the 2008 Champions League, is United's most decorated player . On the ball: Giggs, playing for the Old Trafford side in 2004, made almost 1000 appearances for United . With Giggs, now 40, we’re talking about two different players — the flying winger who became a central schemer. He burst on to the scene at the perfect time. It was the start of the Premier League era and Sir Alex Ferguson was just hitting his stride. When Giggs started off, he used to run at breakneck speed, and it was that sheer pace — allied to superb close control — that meant you needed to stop him in the first few strides. Giggs was then intelligent enough to overcome the loss of a yard of pace, as without a great brain he wouldn’t have been able to extend his career. He showed a real calmness in the second half of his career and was very effective at keeping things simple. Players can always get better and operating more centrally allowed him to use his vision to the full. He became king of the assists. During the mayhem of those Arsenal  versus Manchester United games, I always found him a perfect gent. There was never a raised voice or tackle in anger, he just got on with his job. Perfect gent: Sportsmail's Martin Keown, pictured here tussling with Giggs in 1998, enjoyed his battles with the Welshman . New role: Giggs will serve as Van Gaal's assistant after a spell as interim manager . Winning: Giggs celebrates United's league triumph with Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo in 2008 . He has always conducted himself with  dignity, although he must have that  steeliness to have survived at the top for so long. In terms of the pantheon, it’s hard to put anyone in the Premier League era above him. And in terms of trophies, he’s certainly No 1. I certainly thought he’d have retired long before Sir Alex, that’s for sure! PS . People always ask me about THAT goal Giggs scored against Arsenal in the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay at Villa Park. What people never notice is the great decoy run made by Dwight Yorke, which I had to follow. That run gave Giggs the room to weave his magic. It was a great goal, but I probably should still have stopped it! Stunner: Keown believes he should've stopped Giggs scoring this memorable FA Cup goal against Arsenal in 1999 .

According to the Hunterdon County Democrat, he went on to say: 'I feel blessed to have an angel friend up there to show me the ropes when I get there'. Napolitan was found 'unresponsive' on the floor by State Police, who were called to his home in Kingswood, New Jersey, just after 3pm Saturday. Though the cause of his death has yet to be officially established, police confirmed that they administered a chemical that can counteract the effects of heroin in a bid to save him.

When the wombat arrived at the park, his nose was red and his had minor abrasions to his paws. 'His feet and nose are red because he’s been out of his mum’s pouch for way too long, but we’re hoping he’ll pull through.' Mr Faulkner said on Facebook.

"Up to 30 former Guantanamo detainees released since 2011 have joined forces with the Islamic State, reports claim. Of the 620 detainees released from the prison, around 200 are believed to be fighting with terrorist forces once more. Senior defense forces believe 20 to 30 of those have joined Syrian groups such as ISIS, Fox News reports. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . ISIS connection? Defense sources claim up to 30 Guantanamo detainees have joined ISIS since their release . The suspects, whose identities have not been confirmed, are believed to have migrated to the Middle Eastern war zone from African and European countries which agreed to receive them from the United States. And it is claimed they are now teaching fellow extremists torture methods allegedly used by the U.S. such as waterboarding. The topic is the subject of heated debate as the Republicans release a new ad campaign suggesting President Obama's plans to move Guantanamo to the US will open the gates to ISIS-affiliated terrorists. It says: 'ISIS gaining ground. Terrorists committing mass murder. Ebola inside the U.S. Americans alarmed about national security. What's President Obama doing? Making plans to bring terrorists from Guantanamo to our country... November 4th, Obama's policies are on the ballot. Vote to keep terrorists off U.S. soil. Vote Republican.' According to a press statement, this message will air this week in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Louisiana, and Virginia. Recruiting: The Islamic State is believed to have recruited hundreds of fighters from across the world . Obama has vowed since his 2008 presidential campaign to close the prison camp, which critics say violates U.S. principles by keeping detainees locked up without trial. The White House has long objected to congressional restrictions that would prevent the camp from closing. 'Our position right now, our policy right now, is seeking support from Congress to lift the restrictions that we feel are misguided,' said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. Many Republicans consider the prison, which still holds about 150 prisoners, essential in the fight against international terrorism because it allows prisoners to be held outside the United States. Despite numerous 'Since the president came into office in 2009 the administration has been examining all possible ways we could get to closure of the facility, but we are not drafting options to override the law,' said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council. 'We are continuing to work on transfers [of prisoners] and calling on Congress to lift restrictions.' 'Our position right now, our policy right now, is seeking support from Congress to lift the restrictions that we feel are misguided,' said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. Danger? It comes as the Republicans release an ad warning against Obama's plan to move detainees to the US . John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said on Thursday an 'overwhelming majority' of the American people opposed allowing prisoners from Guantanamo to enter the United States. 'Even as Islamic jihadists are beheading Americans, the White House is so eager to bring these terrorists from Guantanamo Bay to the United States that it is examining ways to thwart Congress and unilaterally re-write the law,' he said in a statement. 'Not only is this scheme dangerous, it is yet another example of what will be this administration's legacy of lawlessness.' The White House said it would continue to make efforts to repatriate or resettle detainees or prosecute them through federal courts or military commission proceedings. The administration would also proceed in talks with foreign governments to negotiate possible prisoner transfers.","20-30 Guantanamo detainees released since 2011 'have joined ISIS in Syria'

"Incredible footage has emerged from a siege in south-east Queensland after a man fled in a stolen Channel Seven news car and crashed into a service station, before surrendering to police. Police were called when neighbours heard a gunshot at a Noosa Heads home about 4.30am on Thursday. When they arrived they heard a man making threats to people inside. The man then made a break for it on a motorbike, police say, before allegedly stealing the news car. Seven News cameraman Peter Steer, who was on his way to cover the incident, said a man on a motorbike stopped him and pulled out a weapon - turning it on him. Scroll down for video . This is the moment the gunman surrenders his weapon after crashing into a gas cylinder . Minutes earlier he confronted cameraman Peter Steer with a gun and then broke down crying . The moment a man takes off in a stolen Channel Seven car was captured by the cameraman . Emergency services crew at the scene of a a gas leak after a gunman stole a  Channel Seven news vehicle and crashed it at a Queensland petrol station . Seven News cameraman Peter Steer, who was on his way to cover the siege, said a man on a motorbike stopped him and said 'I'm the shooter' 'He got off his bike and approached me and said ""I've got a story for you"". I said ""Well mate, you better hurry because I'm going to a shooting"", and he said ""Mate, I'm the shooter.""' Seconds later the man - dressed in a black leather jacket and sporting a thick, grey beard - handed his pistol to Steer and said he wanted to hand himself to police before breaking down in tears. But before he knew it, the man had taken back the pistol and aimed it back at Steer before taking off in his car, which can also be seen in the Seven footage. Steer recounted the experience to Seven News on Thursday evening and told the program: 'It was unexpected, up until that point I'd felt fairly secure knowing that the police I'd called were on their way.' 'When I saw him reach for the passenger side of the vehicle and reach for the gun ... it did sort of ring a few alarm bells in my head.' From there Steer kept the camera rolling out of instinct, saying he weighed up whether he would keep shooting or or get out of the line of fire. Steer then managed to track him down and capture footage at a Eumundi service station where he crashed into a petrol tank and is cornered by police. Officers can be seen pointing their guns toward the man, who they specifically instruct to 'move away' and 'get back'. 'I got to a little town called 'mundi and a chap on a Harley (Davidson) sort of pulled me over, I thought there might have been something wrong with my car,' Mr Steer told Sunrise.

'I thought they were about to start filming or something, I thought it was a documentary, then I didn't think anything of it. 'He looked like a bikie, he had a big beard and everything, just like a standard bikie basically.'

"A second Democratic candidate vying for a seat in the U.S. Senate is refusing to say whether she voted for Barack Obama in the last two presidential elections. When confronted by a tracker for America Rising, a Republican opposition research outfit, yesterday, Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn stayed mum about her voting history. Her only response was in the form of a grin she gave her questioner as she walked away from him and toward the entrance of the venue she was about to enter, an early voting center at the Adamsville Recreation Center, in Atlanta, Georgia, according to the Weekly Standard. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate Michelle Nunn, center, arrives for early voting with her daughter Elizabeth and husband Ron Martin, left, at Fulton County's Adamsville Recreation Center on Wednesday. Nunn was reportedly confronted by a tracker outside the venue and asked whether she voted for Barack Obama for president. The Georgia Senate candidate wouldn't respond . 'Ms. Nunn, did you vote for President Obama in 2008 and 2012?' the tracker had asked her, pouncing on an opportunity to toss Nunn the same question that's tripped up fellow Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes of Kentucky. A Nunn supporter can then be heard in the background telling the young man, 'Would you leave her alone?' As Nunn and her gaggle of supporters continued walking, other members of her entourage began touting President Obama's accomplishments. 'Yes, of course, yes, he’s the president…he’s done great things,' one of the supporters said. 'He's doing great things. Great things,' another voice said in response. Nunn's refusal to speak to the tracker is not surprising given his party affiliation and the nature of his question. But the Democratic candidate's non-answer could come back to haunt her in her close race against businessman David Perdue. Multiple polls conducted in late September and early October had Perdue leading Nunn by several digits. A new SurveyUSA poll released on Wednesday shows a reversal, with Nunn now up by three points. The race could just as easily flip back in Perdue's favor in the next two and a half weeks, however, and pollsters expect this race to be a nail biter. Nunn is the daughter of former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, a notable Democrat who has given thousands of dollars to Obama's election efforts. She's currently on leave of absence from her day job as CEO of Georgia-based non-profit organization Points of Light. Perdue is the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, also a Republican. The self-funded, former  Dollar General head defeated Republican Congressman Jack Kingston in a brutal primary this summer to win the GOP nomination. Nunn and Perdue are competing to replace retiring Republican politician Saxby Chambliss. A third, Libertarian candidate, Amanda Swafford, is also vying for the seat and could prove a spoiler on Election Day. Swafford is steadily polling at five percent of the vote. If neither Nunn or Perdue is able to win 50 percent of the vote, Georgia law calls for a run-off election that won't be held until early next year when other newly elected senators are already descending on Washington to begin the new legislative session. Michele Nunn, right, and her family participate in early voting on Wednesday in Atlanta. Nunn is running against Republican David Perdue. The two are virtually tied two and a half weeks ahead of the election . Neither major political party wants an extended campaign season lasting into 2015, and both the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are pouring loads of cash into the race on behalf of their respective candidates. Earlier this week the DSCC announced that it would go dark in Kentucky, where its candidate repeatedly stumbled over questions about her support for Obama, in order to shift $1 million into Nunn's race in Georgia. Ironically, Nunn could become the next victim of the 'did she or didn't she' vote for Obama conundrum that has plagued Kentucky's Grimes. Grimes and Nunn are hardly alone in their attempts to distance themselves from their party head, whose approval rating is at a career low, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll that came out on Wednesday. New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, Colorado Sen. Mark Udall, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor and Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu have all went out of their way to avoid being associated with Obama this year as they wage reelection bids. Udall is the senator who was supposed to appear at a July fundraiser with Obama, then cancelled at the last minute to stay in Washington. He claimed at a debate in September that the 'White House when they look down the front lawn the last person they want to see coming is me.' U.S. Senate candidates bearing Obama's party ID are avoiding the president like the plague. As a result, Obama, who is seen here delivering remarks during a cabinet level meeting at the White House on Wednesday, hasn't made a single public appearance on behalf of a Democratic contender this fall . Another Colorado Democrat, Gov. John Hickenlooper, is now claiming that he was never a proponent of Obama's signature healthcare reform law. At a debate last night against Republican Bob Beauprez, Hickenlooper said while talking about health care, 'and again, I'm not big fan of the Affordable Care Act, I wouldn't have designed it that...' He stopped short of finishing his sentence as he was both interrupted by his opponent and booed by members of the live audience. Picking up where he left off, Hickenlooper asserted that like many governors, he would have preferred a state-by-state approach to healthcare reform 'and not had a roll out with that much detail.' 'And all of us are working together, the governors. to try and figure out how to get waivers,' he said. As his Republican opponent immediately pointed out on Twitter after the debate, Hickenlooper was singing a slightly different tune when the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the individual mandate portion of Obamacare was constitutional. A press release from Hickenlooper's office on the decision says that 'the Affordable Care Act helped build on the work of the state’s Blue Ribbon Commission for Health Care Reform and provided increased funding to make comprehensive reform possible. 'A number of important aspects of the law are already improving the lives of many Coloradans based on implementation of the Affordable Care Act in Colorado,' the statement said and listed off a number of benefits of the federal healthcare reform law. Also included in the press release is a direct quote from Hickenlooper praising the legislation. 'More Coloradans will benefit when the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented in 2014,' he said. The Democratic governor did point out his own state's efforts to improve health care for its residents, independent of the federal healthcare law, throughout the press release, however. Once considered a rising star of the Democratic Party, Hickenlooper is trailing Beauprez by four points, per a Quinnipiac poll that came out yesterday. The incumbent governor is gaining on Beauprez, who was once ahead by 10 points, but he the race still leans heavily in Beauprez's favor. Like Udall, Hickenlooper also skipped events with Obama when the president was in town this summer. He memorably grabbed a beer and shot pool with the president when they bumped into each other at a local bar, however. Obama won both games.","When confronted by a tracker for a Republican outfit yesterday, Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn stayed mum about her voting history .

"Robin van Persie continued his fine form ahead of the World Cup by scoring the winner as Holland beat Ghana in their penultimate warm-up friendly in Rotterdam. The Manchester United striker settled a contest that never truly ignited when he tapped in after five minutes following quick-thinking from Wesley Sneijder to square the ball with the goalkeeper closing in. Louis van Gaal’s team dominated possession from start to finish and would have settled the contest long before half-time if Arjen Robben had not been wasteful in front of goal.

The Dutch . captain was the spearhead of a flexible formation set up by Van Gaal . that was ostensibly 5-3-2 but became 3-5-2 or 3-4-3 when wing-backs . Daley Blind and Daryl Janmaat bombed forward. If Van Gaal brings such a system to the Premier League next season, we’ll certainly be in for some fun and games. It . may have ensured Holland plenty of the ball but they couldn’t raise the . game beyond a staccato rhythm and chances were frustratingly short in . supply.

"The First World War's last surviving battleship is to be transformed into a floating museum. A £12m lottery funding boost will enable the National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN) to turn HMS Caroline into a visitor attraction in time for centenary commemorations of the 1916 Battle of Jutland off the coast of Denmark. The derelict vessel, which is currently docked in the same Belfast shipyards where the Titanic was built, was in danger of rusting away or even being scrapped before moves to restore it started to build up steam two years ago. Scroll down for video . HMS CAroline, the First World War's last surviving battleship, is to be transformed into a floating museum . The Heritage Lottery Fund has now awarded £11.5m to fund the work ahead of 2016. The HLF had already pledged £845,000 as an initial commitment and a £1m grant had been secured from the National Heritage Memorial Fund for vital repair work. The ship, which was built on Merseyside in 1914, came dangerously close to sinking during the big freeze that hit Northern Ireland in 2010 when pipes and radiators burst. The National Museum of the Royal Navy is working in partnership with Stormont's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Deti) to deliver the project. Deti is also offering £2.7m towards the restoration. Captain John Rees, NMRN's Chief of Staff and chairman of the HMS Caroline Project Board, said time was now of the essence to complete the work. The derelict vessel is currently situated in Alexandra Dock, the same Belfast shipyard where Titanic was built . 'The support and help we have received from the Heritage Lottery Fund has been simply first rate and I am thrilled that the funding is now in place and that we can now get on and deliver a world- class attraction,' he said. The museum will complement a variety of maritime attractions in Belfast's old shipyards, including the £97m Titanic Belfast visitor attraction. A light cruiser, weighing 3,750 tons and measuring 446ft (136m), HMS Caroline was part of the screening force which sailed out ahead of the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet during the Battle of Jutland to establish the position of the German battleships. Both sides suffered heavy casualties in what was the most significant clash between battleships during the First World War. Britain and Germany both claimed victory. Six years WW1 ended, HMS Caroline was moved from Portsmouth to Belfast to become a training vessel for local Royal Navy Reserves . Highlights of the new visitor attraction will be the ship's bridge with its original compasses and telegraphs, the engine rooms and the ship's the living quarters, which have remained unchanged in 100 years . Six years after the war ended, HMS Caroline was moved from Portsmouth to Belfast to become a training vessel for local Royal Navy Reserves. Most of the rest of the fleet was decommissioned and broken up. HMS Caroline performed its function as a drill ship up until 2011, apart from during the Second World War when it was used as an operations headquarters for the efforts to protect the Atlantic convoys from German U-Boats. Highlights of the new visitor attraction will be the ship's bridge with its original compasses and telegraphs, the engine rooms with four Parson's turbines still in position and many other aspects of the living quarters, which have remained unchanged in 100 years. UK Minister for the First World War Centenary Helen Grant described the development as 'wonderful news'. HMS Caroline performed its function as a drill ship up until 2011, apart from during the Second World War when it was used as an operations headquarters for the efforts to protect the Atlantic convoys from German U-Boats . 'HMS Caroline has had a long and distinguished career, starting of course in the First World War,' she said. 'It is beyond doubt an important part of our island history, and it's great that the Heritage Lottery Fund have been able to support its restoration in this centenary year so that it can continue serving, in a different role, for many years to come.' Carole Souter, chief executive of HLF, said: 'As we mark the centenary of the First World War, people across the UK are learning more about how it changed millions of lives. A light cruiser, weighing 3,750 tons and measuring 446ft (136m), HMS Caroline was part of the screening force which sailed out ahead of the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet during the Battle of Jutland to establish the position of the German battleships . 'This Lottery grant will restore and open up HMS Caroline, and enable future generations to explore the incredibly important, yet often lesser known, role played by those who served in the Royal Navy during this momentous conflict.' Professor Dominic Tweddle, director-general of the National Museum, said: 'HMS Caroline is quite simply one of the world's most significant historic fighting ships and pre-dates the partition of Ireland. 'To conserve the ship and open it to the public as a shared space, museum and cultural hub in Belfast is hugely significant to the people of all Ireland.' Stormont Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster said: 'HMS Caroline has huge potential as a visitor experience and will contribute to the wider physical regeneration of Titanic Quarter, creating jobs during both the restoration phase, with the work being undertaken in Belfast, and when the ship opens to the public in 2016. 'Today's funding announcement is great news and the restored ship will be a tremendous asset for Belfast and will complement the existing tourist attractions in Titanic Quarter to give more for visitors to see and do.'","HMS Caroline, built in 1914, is currently situated in Belfast's Alexandra Dock .

"About 9,000 U.S. Marines stationed on the Japanese island of Okinawa will be moved to the U.S. territory of Guam and other locations in the Asia-Pacific, including Hawaii, under a U.S.-Japan agreement announced yesterday. The move is part of a broader arrangement designed to ease tensions in the countries' defense alliance, which stem in part from opposition to the American presence on the island. It also reflects a desire by the Obama administration to spread U.S. forces more widely in the Asia-Pacific region, as America rebalances its defence priorities after a decade of war in the Middle East. Moving out: Around 9,000 U.S. Marines stationed on the Japanese island of Okinawa are to be relocated under a new U.S.-Japan agreement . The agreement was outlined in a joint statement issued last night by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and their Japanese counterparts. Citing an 'increasingly uncertain security environment' in the Asia-Pacific region, they said their agreement was intended to maintain a robust U.S. military presence to ensure the defence of Japan. Okinawa: The sub-tropical island is home to around half of the U.S. troops stationed in Japanese territories . 'Japan is not just a close ally, but also a close friend,' Mr Panetta said. 'I . look forward to deepening that friendship and strengthening our . partnership as, together, we address security challenges in the region.' As yet, there has been no indication of when the 9,000 Marines will leave Okinawa. According to the joint statement, their departure will come 'when appropriate facilities are available to receive them' on Guam and elsewhere. Allies: U.S. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said Japan was 'not just a close ally, but also a close friend' to America . Under the new agreement, about 10,000 Marines will remain on Okinawa, which has been a key element of the U.S. military presence in Asia for decades. The U.S. also has a substantial Air Force presence on the island. Japan's Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba said the country wanted to 'reduce the burden on Okinawa,' adding, 'I think we have made some progress and this plan offers specific and forward-looking action.' Japan and its territories are central to America's strategy for deterring aggression in the region, and for reinforcing the Korean peninsula in the event of a North Korean attack on South Korea. The Obama administration believes the new agreement with Japan will make the alliance more sustainable, while also giving the Marines more regional flexibility. Between 4,700 and 5,000 Marines will relocate from Okinawa to Guam, while the remainder of the 9,000 will be transferred to Hawaii or be part of a rotational presence in Australia and elsewhere in the region. Earlier this week, Governor of Hawaii Neil Abercrombie said he expects around 2,700 Marines will be moved there. The cost of relocating Marines to Guam is expected to be around $8.6 billion, and defence officials claim Japan will pay $3.1 billion of this. The total cost includes an unspecified amount for possible construction of new training ranges in the Northern Mariana Islands that could be used jointly by U.S. and Japanese forces. Controversial: The transfer of Marines from Okinawa to Guam has been in limbo for years because of issues surrounding the U.S. air base Futenma . The agreement also calls for a phased . return to Japanese control of certain parcels of land on Okinawa which . are presently used by the American military. The . shift of Marines from Okinawa to Guam has been in limbo for years . because it was linked to the closure and replacement of Marine Corps Air . Station Futenma. Okinawans . fiercely oppose the existence of Futenma, and believe the base should . be closed and a replacement established overseas or elsewhere in Japan. The U.S., however, has insisted that Japan should find a Futenma . replacement on Okinawa. For now, the dispute remains unresolved. The accord was timed for completion before Japanese Prime Minster Yoshihiko Noda's . scheduled visit to Washington on Monday for talks with President Barack . Obama. The U.S. military presence on Okinawa has been a cause of historic tension between America and Japan. Many of the island's residents view the troops as a cause of congestion and increased crime. Much of the bad feeling has its roots in the 1995 kidnapping and rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl by three American servicemen. U.S. Navy Seaman Marcus Gill and U.S. Marines Rodrico Harp and Kendrick Ledet kidnapped the schoolgirl before beating her, duct taping her eyes shut and raping her. Gill pleaded guilty to the rape, and the other two men pleaded guilty to conspiracy. A Japanese judge sentenced Gill and Harp to seven years' imprisonment, while Ledet received six and a half years. The men were released in 2003, and dishonourably discharged from the U.S. military. Unsurprisingly, the incident provoked a public outcry, and the people of Okinawa placed a full-page advert in the New York Times condemning the rape and other aspects of the U.S. presence on their island. Although top U.S. government officials publicly apologised for the crime, tensions continued to brew and the incident remains fresh in the minds of many.

"Kate Moss controversially proclaimed that ‘nothing tastes as good as skinny feels’, and it would appear that her best friend Stella McCartney agrees. Fashion designer Stella came under fire from fans yesterday after posting a picture on her Instagram page of an emaciated model in a vest from her brand’s Summer 2015 collection, alongside the caption: ‘Worn well!! X Stella.’ Hundreds took to the page to express their disapproval, with one writing: ‘Disgusting. That is not worn well, it’s hanging over bones.’ Another added: ‘Appalling image.

It was replaced with one of British model Malaika Firth in the vest. A percentage of sales from the garment is being donated to the Linda McCartney Centre at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, which specialises in cancer treatment and is named after Stella’s mother, who died of breast cancer in 1998.

"A 23-year-old has stunned medics after his deficient heart appeared to mend itself when doctors decided they would need to perform a transplant. And the parents of Michael Crowe are attributing his recovery to the power of prayer  - after the student's heart miraculously started working again, according to the Omaha World Herald. The organ started beating again hours after doctors discovered Crowe had a blood infection which threatened any transplant operation. Michael's heart had been on the verge of stopping beating when he arrived at the Heart Transplant unit at the Nebraska Medical Centre last month - and doctors hooked him up to a machine to keep blood pumping through his arteries.

He was placed on a transplant list . and put in a medically induced coma as his mother Marie and father John . faced an agonising wait for a match. A heart was found three weeks later, and doctors prepared to perform the risky transplant.

"A council candidate's campaign poster - which urges residents to 'vote for the black guy' - has sparked a race debate within an Adelaide community.

African-born Nkweto Nkamba is vying to be the representative for the Parks ward - in Adelaide's north-west - and wanted a way to stand out from the crowd . But he was adamant the posters were not racially motivated and so far it had attracted a good response. 'I think it's an education [for] society of what racist is,' he told ABC Radio. 'I'm actually coming out in a humble way, I'm an easy-going guy, if you like me, vote for me.' The posters have earned him so much recognition that strangers have even started stopping him on the street, with some asking him to pose in photos with them. His poster has sparked a debate in the community, with some asking if it was politically correct . 'This guy comes out of his house, I don't even know him, and he's like, ""Hey, it's the black guy"",' Mr Nkamba told 7News with a laugh. Supporters have also taken to the 32-year-old's Facebook page to voice their amusement at the tongue-in-cheek campaign. 'I love the humour, a light way to look at serious issues,' Eugenia Torrealba wrote. Julie Pearce said: 'If you were in my area NK I'd vote for ya, but then I think you already know that.' But some residents have questioned whether or not the posters were politically correct. 'The world you live in now, you can't say ""black"" anymore, can you? Can you still say that?' one voter told 7News. But Mr Nkamba said the response has been generally positive within the Port Adelaide-Enfield community .

"The best-selling author of more than 30 erotic novels has filed for bankruptcy. Kristina Laferne Roberts, whose pen name is Zane, has published more than 18 erotic novels including  Addicted, which hits movie theaters this week. She started by secretly writing and posting her creations online after her children went to bed - and ended up on the New York Times best-seller list 26 times. But last night it emerged she is 'the top tax cheat in Maryland' and has been forced to file for bankruptcy. Bankrupt: Kristina Laferne Roberts, known to readers as Zane, has filed for bankruptcy owing over $540,000 . The Washington Post reports that Roberts, a marketing graduate from Prince George's County, owes the IRS over $540,000. Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot called Roberts the state's top individual 'tax cheat' with undeclared earnings dating back more than 10 years. The state has been trying to collect back taxes from Roberts since 2003. Finally, in June, she filed for bankruptcy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Maryland, the Post said. Roberts listed her total assets at over $1.4 million including two houses in Maryland, and claimed more than $3.4 million in liabilities. That figure includes more than $1.4 million owed to creditors and more than $337,000 in back state taxes. A call to Roberts' attorney was not immediately returned on Sunday. The news has emerged just days before the movie adaptation of her novel Addicted is released across the US. Movie adaptation: Her 2012 novel Addicted (left) has been made into a movie (right) hitting theaters this week . 'Cheat': The Maryland Comptroller branded Roberts the state's top individual tax cheat after years of dodging . It tells the story of a gallerist who risks her family and flourishing career when she enters into an affair with a talented painter and slowly loses control of her life. Directed by Bille Woodruff, who created Honey, and starring Sharon Leah, of DreamGirls fame, it is slated to be a box office hit. Her other work includes New York Times best-seller Afterburn about the liaison between a chiropractor and a bank clerk in Washington DC. Dear G-Spot, also critically-acclaimed, is a collection of letters from people that have contacted Zane with sexual questions - 'the preacher's wife worrying about being judged, the virgin, the guy next door, the gay man next door, the woman with low self-esteem, and the other woman with a sex drive over the moon'. Career: She started by secretly sharing her work online after her children went to bed but has since landed a book deal with Simon & Schuster and been named on the New York Times best-seller list 26 times . Roberts became Zane in November 1997 after sending chapters she had written to people she met online, she told theGrio last year. 'I wrote a short story and shared it with a few people I'd met online,' she said. 'I self-published three more stories online and got about 8,000 hits by word of mouth alone.' Numerous publishing firms offered book deals, but she refused to tone down the explicit nature of her work: 'They were asking me to tone down my material. They said it was too graphic.' 'That wasn't something I was going to do; I'd received so many emails from readers thanking me for affirming that they were normal, who felt empowered by my material.'","Kristina Laferne Roberts, pen-named Zane, owes IRS over $540,000 .

The firm’s boss, Stephen Campbell, manager of Car 2000, told the Guardian: ‘We have had quite a lot of customers requesting what they call a local driver. ‘A bit insane if you consider that most of the [Asian] lads were born in Rochdale. But it’s a business and we have got a duty to do what the customer asks us to. 'Wake-up call': Simon Danczuk, the town’s Labour MP, branded the development 'extremely worrying' ‘I don’t think we can discriminate against the customer in the same way. It is a business at the end of the day. We have a large bank loan to pay back.’ Mr Campbell said around 20 drivers had left Eagle Taxis after the two drivers were prosecuted. He added: ‘One of them got a knife held to his throat, one of them had his car smashed up.’ Mr Campbell said the exodus cost him an estimated £40,000 - 30 per cent of the firm’s annual profit: ‘It was devastating.’ He said: ‘The Asian drivers are harder working, they do what they are asked and they don’t complain about it. 'If the public could actually see these [Asian] people close up and see what they are about, I don’t think they would be asking for white drivers. ‘We do get a lot of customers ringing up and asking us for a particular Asian guy as well.’ But he said customers who had asked for a white driver might have to wait as long as 20 minutes -compared with the average wait of three minutes. Mr Danczuk said: ‘This is extremely worrying and a stark reminder of the impact grooming scandals have had on northern towns. It must act as a wake-up call to politicians who just pretend tensions like this don’t exist and bury their heads in the sand.’ Mark Widdup, of Rochdale Council, said: ‘There is currently nothing in the conditions of their licence which state that they cannot operate such a policy, just as some firms choose to offer customers only female drivers.’","Minicab firm Car 2000 says customers are asking for white or 'local' drivers .

"Tragedy: Anna Maria Mostrom, 29, has been left brain dead after a bus crash on Roosevelt Island in New York last week . A Swedish model and former Scandinavia's Next Top Model contestant has been left brain dead after a bus hit her while she riding a bike. Anna Maria Mostrom, 29, was cycling on Roosevelt Island in New York last week when the bus  turned left and knocked her onto the road. She has been eft with serious brain injuries and is now on a respirator at Weill Cornell Medical Center where doctors saying her prognosis is 'bleak'. Her friend Timothy Philips told the New York Daily News: 'They are making preparations to donate her organs, which will save a lot of lives.' After arriving at hospital he said that the family, who have flown in from Sweden, have received an 'outpouring of love' and that the walls of her room are covered in notes and photos. Miss Mostrom, who was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash, has undergone two surgeries to stop the bleeding in her brain and is on full life support. Mr Philips also wrote on Facebook:'Thank you all for showering AnnaMaria with so much love and hope from near and far. 'Her family and many of her friends are gathered here with her now and the staff of the hospital says that they have never witnessed such an outpouring of love and affection for anyone before. 'Please know someone has been at her side every moment since her arrival, she has never been alone. 'The walls of her room are covered with notes and photos as flowers are not allowed in intensive care. 'Even at 3am last night there were ten loved ones beside her bed. 'The light within her is fading but her star shines brighter than ever. 'Open your eyes and heart wide and you may just see it in a flower or a bell like laugh on the breeze. 'Please keep Anna Maria in your thoughts, your love guides her path now as her spirit reaches its destination.' He added that staff have told them to 'hope for a miracle' as they have never seen someone recover from similar injuries. Police have said the 51-year-old driver has not been charged and remained at the scene after the crash. He was behind the wheel of the Red Bus, which circles the island, and was going south when he hit her. The island between Manhattan and Queens is sparsely populated and has little vehicular traffic as many people normally reach it by the Subway or gondola. Miss Mostrom, who grew up in Kongstorm in central Sweden, was a contestant in the Scandinavian version of Top Model in 2005, which helped to launch her catwalk career. Scene: Witnesses gather around Miss Mostrom while she is being treated. Her bike (right) is dealt with by police officers while standing in front of the bus . Career: The former Scandinavia's Next Top Model contestant  was knocked off and left with serious brain injuries and is now on a respirator at Weill Cornell Medical Center with doctors saying her prognosis is 'bleak' She took part in the Swedish pre-cycle of the show but missed out on a place in the main series. For the past two years she has lived in New York City  and was said to be looking for more opportunities in the creative industry. Her father Ronnie told a Swedish Newspaper Expressen she was 'rammed' by the bus and her family are holding a vigil for her at her bedside. The Roosevelt Island Operating Cooperation who run the buses says that they are investigating the incident and insisted they are 'actively working to ensure that our streets are safe for cyclists and motorists'. A campaigner has said the incident was 'tragic' but 'all too common and 100 per cent avoidable in New York City'. Keegan Stephan, the founder of Right of Way, told Mail Online: 'In New York City, a pedestrian or cyclist is seriously injured or killed by a motor vehicle driver every single day, and the cause of the vast majority of these crashes is speeding or failure to yield by the motorist. 'The NYPD must charge this driver with the criminal offense of failure to yield and the District Attorney must prosecute that crime to the fullest if we are ever going to curb this epidemic and ensure that Maria does not die in vain.' Talented: She is pictured with Czech model Karolina Kurkova at the Global Film and Music Festival in Ischia, Italy, in 2011.

"A North Carolina bartender had a spell of bad luck turned around after a tipper left a $1,000 on a $14 bar bill. Chrisi Kemp was behind the bar at One Whirled Cafe in Wake Forest last Thursday evening when a local walked in and ordered some drinks. Kemp already had a lot on her mind. Bills for her daughter's medical care had been adding up and her washing machine had broken down. Good luck: Just when things seemed at their worst, bartender Chrisi Kemp received a $1000 tip that helped cover the family's medical bills and repair costs . While the man lingered over a vodka tonic and later a kamikaze, the two discussed her garden and his vacation home in Belize. 'It was just a very odd conversation,' Kemp said. She didn't talk about the problems she was dealing with back home. Still her luck was due to change. The man, a retiree who asked her not to share his name, put a $1,000 tip on his credit card. With just a $14.01 bill, that's more than 7000% gratuity. She and the management checked to see if there was some mistake, but the man told them to go ahead and charge the gratuity. Kemp made sure to share the generosity, dividing up some of tip with staff at One Whirled Cafe. 'As much as I might have needed the money, you still pay it forward,' she said. 'You don't let greed come into it.' Gratuitous: A local's tip blew away the suggested gratuity amounts, and Kemp made sure to share her windfall with the rest of the staff . One Whirled Cafe has only been open  three months and serves a rotating offering of international-inspired plates. 'It's slow,' said Kemp about business. 'It's going to be this way until we build a clientele.' But being the recipient of a fortuitous tip has already piqued interest in the area, and one customer said he learned about the restaurant from the flurry of news.","Chrisi Kemp was worrying about medical bills and a broken washing machine at her bartending shift at One Whirled Cafe, a Wake Forest restaurant .

"Problems for Ed Miliband: The latest UK-wide polls by YouGov suggest Labour’s position in Scotland is increasingly in crisis . Ed Miliband is being warned a lack of support in Scotland and a surge by the Green Party in England and Wales could cost him the next general election. Pollsters say Scottish Nationalists are on course to seize as many as 20 seats in Labour’s heartlands north of the border, while the resurgent Greens are joining Ukip in eating into its traditional support across the rest of the country. Green leader Natalie Bennett said yesterday her party was aiming to outpoll the Liberal Democrats next year and hoped to seize half a dozen Commons seats. Recent national polls put them on between 5 and 7 per cent, and they beat the Lib Dems in the European elections. An SNP advance combined with a surge in support for the Greens next year could badly undermine Mr Miliband’s alleged ‘35 per cent strategy’, which would see him win power on a relatively small share of the vote made up of Labour’s core support plus former Lib Dems disillusioned with the coalition. With speculation swirling about Mr Miliband’s future, one of his rivals for the leadership, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, was yesterday forced to insist he would not seek to replace him. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme : ‘I rule it out... No, I am Labour loyalist to my core. I am loyal to the leader, and the leader of our party, Ed Miliband, has said, the NHS will be his big priority going towards this election. ‘I am 100 per cent focused on developing a plan for the NHS that can speak to the country and can win the next election for Labour and make Ed Miliband prime minister.’ Scroll down for video . Interview with Andrew Marr: One of Mr Miliband’s rivals for the leadership, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham (right), was yesterday forced to insist he would not seek to replace him . The latest UK-wide polls by YouGov suggest Labour’s position in Scotland is increasingly in crisis, putting them just six points ahead of the Tories on 26 per cent in one, and on just 20 per cent, one point behind the Tories, in another. It is thought to be the first time since the 1950s that the Conservatives have been ahead of Labour in a Scottish poll, though the results are based on a small sample size with a large margin of error. Amid growing infighting and disillusionment, two of Labour’s former Scottish First Ministers launched scathing criticisms of the state of the party. Jack McConnell, now Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale, said the party must rediscover its 'sense of purpose'. He said the party’s difficulties were ‘very sad for Labour, but more importantly it’s very sad for those we represent’. He added: ‘What is our purpose? Why should people support us? We need policies and ideas that reflect that – and we’re running out of time.’ Attacks: Two of Labour’s former Scottish First Ministers - Jack McConnell (left) and his predecessor Henry McLeish (right) - launched scathing criticisms of the state of the party . His predecessor Henry McLeish claimed many of Labour’s supporters no longer know ‘what the party stands for’ and it has lost ‘enormous ground’ to the SNP. Working-class voters: Shadow Scottish secretary, Margaret Curran (pictured), suggested the party was to abandon Tony Blair’s centrist legacy . Mr McLeish criticised Westminster’s approach to the debate over which powers should be handed to Edinburgh following the No vote in last month’s independence referendum as ‘pathetic’ and ‘clumsy’. Although Scots backed the Union in last month’s vote, the Yes campaign triumphed in Labour’s heartlands of Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire and Mr Miliband was forced to cut short a campaign visit to Edinburgh after being shouted down by protesters. To the dismay of the dwindling band of Blairite MPs, their champion, shadow international development secretary Jim Murphy, yesterday ruled himself out of standing as Labour’s leader in Scotland after months of flirting the the job. ‘Rather than being involved directly, I’m determined to be a member of Ed Miliband’s cabinet next year,’ he told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme. Senior figures close to Mr Miliband are now urging Gordon Brown to take over from Johann Lamont, the struggling current leader, to try to stem the catastrophic losses to the SNP. Yesterday the shadow Scottish secretary, Margaret Curran, suggested the party was to abandon Tony Blair’s centrist legacy and return to ‘socialist principles’ in a desperate bid to win back working-class voters. Writing in the Scotland on Sunday newspaper, she said: ‘The Labour Party of today is not the Labour Party of a decade ago. “We have a leader across the UK who has learned the lessons of Iraq and opposed military action in Syria, who refuses to kowtow to vested interests like the banks and the energy companies and who believes that politics is about building a movement of working people to change our country. She continued: ‘We need a response from the Left that responds to the conditions of people’s lives. The socialist principles of equality, redistribution and social justice need to shape our politics as much today as they did when I joined the party.’ Peter Kellner, president of YouGov, says the SNP is on the brink of a major advance and could win as many as 20 extra seats next year, mainly at Labour’s expense. He said Labour has ‘big problems’ in Scotland after failing to convince many of their traditional supporters to vote against independence. A surge in membership in recent weeks has seen the SNP overtake the Lib Dems to become the third biggest party in Britain, with 82,000 paid-up supporters.","Scottish Nationalists 'to seize 20 seats in Labour heartlands' in Scotland .

"Women are often warned about the importance of regularly checking their breasts for signs of cancer. Now, an advert featuring Elaine C Smith, who played Mary-Doll Nesbitt in Rab C. Nesbitt, has gone one step further. The public health ad commissioned by the Scottish government is the first in the UK to feature fully exposed breasts, according to its creators. Scroll down for video . Powerful message: The public service announcement features Elaine C Smith, comedian and former star of the BBC's Rab C Nesbitt . Early symptoms: The full-frontal images are of breasts exhibiting possible warning signs of cancer, such as crusty nipples . It goes beyond the usual message about checking for lumps to show all the different potential symptoms that should prompt women to see their doctor. These include 'crusty' or inverted nipples, dimpled breasts and 'orange-peel' skin. Other warning signs are leaking nipples, aching and any change in the shape or size of the breast, the advert explains. Smith begins by showing pictures of healthy breasts of various shapes and sizes - including post-breastfeeding. She then goes on to display pictures of breasts that could have cancer. Famous face: Smith with Gregor Fisher in popular BBC series Rab C. Nesbitt . Little-known symptoms, Smith tells . the viewer, include discharge from the nipples, a rash on or around the . nipple and pain in the breast or armpit. Created by The Leith Agency, the new ad features a bare-shouldered Smith holding up a series of actual-size photos of breasts over her chest - each exhibiting . different symptoms of breast cancer. The actress, comedian and BBC sitcom star has a personal interest in the cause . because she lost her own mother to cancer. The Leith Agency worked with the chief . health officer of Scotland and cancer specialists to create images that . were as accurate as possible depicting the less well known early signs of the disease. The resulting ad is revealing in all senses of the word. It could cause some shock to parents concerned about their children's viewing habits, despite only being shown after the 9pm watershed. The graphic images are currently being shown on popular channels STV, Channel 4 Scotland and Channel 5 Scotland. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with about 48,000 women diagnosed with the disease in Britain each year. Most (eight out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also get breast cancer. As the video emphasises, women should see a doctor if they notice any change in the size or shape of one or both breasts.

"The parents of American aid worker Peter Kassig have taken to TV to reveal the heartbreak of their son's ISIS captors' 'unreasonable demands', which they are 'powerless' to fulfill.

In a preview of the footage, they say they hope their son will learn of their TV appearance - either directly or indirectly - and 'know we are doing everything we can to secure his release'.

Sitting in their living room with a school photo of Peter - also known by the Islamic name Abdul-Rahman in the background - the Kassigs said ISIS militants have not 'asked'' for anything. Instead, 'they demand, they simply demand,' Mr Kassig told correspondent Margaret Brennan on CBS This Morning. Donning a purple jacket and turtleneck top, Mrs Kassig added: 'And their demands have always been ones we cannot accommodate.' Ms Brennan then asked the couple if the demands were 'beyond what is reasonable in terms of money, in terms of power?', to which Mrs Kassig replied: 'In both cases, yes.' Looking down with teary eyes, she continued: 'And we have sent them back messages that we cannot do what you ask. We have tried, but we don't have the power.'

While in Turkey, he founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), a medically-oriented emergency relief group that serves refugee populations and internally displaced persons. It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, that Peter was captured by members of ISIS as he headed to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. In the brutal video showing Mr Henning's death earlier this month, Peter was shown kneeling in the desert while a masked militant condemned President Barack Obama for 'aerial bombardments'. The militant added: 'It's only right we continue to strike the necks of your people.' Emotional plea: Mr and Mrs Kassig's latest plea  comes just days after they released an emotional YouTube video (pictured), in which they begged their son's ISIS captors to 'show mercy' and free him .

Mr and Mrs Kassig's latest plea to Peter's captors comes just a few days after they appealed directly to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi on Twitter, begging him to spare their only son's life. Mrs Kassig posted a letter on the social networking site, reading: 'I am trying to get in touch with the Islamic State about my son's fate. I am an old woman, and Abdul-Rahman is my only child. 'My husband and I are on our own, with no help from the government. We would like to talk to you. How can we reach you?'

Selfless: Peter (pictured) changed his name to Abdul-Rahman after converting to Islam while held captive . Mr Kassig, a school teacher, who was filmed on a sofa alongside his wife, told militants: 'Our family deplores all human suffering and the loss of innocent life, no matter who is responsible. 'We know that the Syrians have suffered. We also believe violence is not the solution to the problems that trouble us all.' Speaking directly to her son, Mrs Kassig, who was donning a headscarf and clasping a photo of the aid worker in her hands, added: 'We are so very proud of you and the work you have done to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. 'Our hearts ache for you to be granted your freedom so we can hug you again and then set you free to continue the life you have chosen, the life of service to those in greatest need.' Beheading: On October 3, Mr Kassig was threatened with death in a video showing the beheading of 47-year-old British aid worker Alan Henning (pictured). He was seen kneeling in the sand at the end of the footage . Ed Kassig: 'We're hoping that, if not directly, word will get to him indirectly that we're doing everything we can to secure his release.'

We have tried, but we don't have the power.' The  beheading of Mr Henning  followed the murders of three other captives in similar circumstances: U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines. U.S. officials have confirmed that Mr Kassig is being held by Islamic State militants, but have declined to give any more details of his capture. The aid worker's family said in a statement earlier this month that they had stayed silent about this news 'at the wish of those who have held their son.' President: Barack Obama (pictured) has condemned the death of Mr Henning and urged that U.S. forces and its allies will bring his killers to justice . They also revealed that their son had converted to Islam while being held hostage. Former hostages told the family that Kassig's new faith has given him comfort during his long captivity. In a letter to his parents, which they received on June 2, Peter revealed that he was 'scared to die' and saddened by the pain the ordeal has caused his family, BBC News reported. The hostage wrote: 'I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all.' He continued: 'If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.' He also told his parents that he prayed every day and was not angry about his situation 'in terms of my faith'. The letter ended with the words: 'I love you.' President Barack Obama has strongly condemned the death of Mr Henning and urged that U.S. forces and its allies will bring his killers to justice. 'Mr Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family and the people of the United Kingdom,' the politican said in a statement. 'Standing together with our U.K. friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder - as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines - to justice.' The President added that the U.S. and other nations will continue to take action to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the Islamic State group.","Peter Kassig has been threatened with death in a video released by ISIS .

"After hordes of trick-or-treating children enjoyed the hottest Halloween on record at 16C yesterday - Britain is set for a frostier Bonfire Night with temperatures expected to plummet as low as -3C. Yesterday, freak weather saw people sunbathing in Brighton while Gravesend, London and Charlwood, Surrey, both had temperatures above 23C, smashing the 46-year-old national record. But the Met Office predict a return to traditional November weather in the next few days - culminating in a 'crisp and chilly' Guy Fawkes Night on November 5. Scroll down for video .

'In sheltered inland areas of England and Wales we expect to see low temperatures of around -1C while in London it's more like 2C.' This is a staggering 14C lower than the temperature in the capital last night. Mr Partridge added: 'But it will be clear and crisp with light winds - which really is perfect weather for Bonfire Night. 'From Monday, the weather will start to feel normal for November and there will certainly be a marked difference from the unusually warm nights we have been experiencing.

"Apple is rumoured to be adding a gold colour option for its full size iPad Air (pictured left) which could go on sale as soon as next month . Apple is putting the finishing touches to a new version of it's iPad air - including a bling gold version. The tech giant is set to unveil the new iPads at a small event at its Cupertino Headquarters on October 16th, according to tech site Re/Code. The small event is expected to be in stark contrast to the star-studded launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which saw U2 playing before the firm controversially gave away the band's new album. The move is thought to be designed to boost sales of its full-size tablets, which are in decline. Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets more similar to the Californian company’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours. New versions of the 9.7-inch tablet  could include a golden metal rear cover as well as the silver and grey currently offered for the iPad Air, ‘people familiar with the matter’ told Bloomberg. The new iPads are predicted to sport a thinner, more rounded design, similar to the iPhone 6. Hidden code in the latest iOS 8.1 beta software hints that the iPads will feature a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and Apple Pay functionality, The Guardian reported. The code says that users can 'pay with iPad using Touch ID. With Apple Pay, you no longer need to type card numbers and shipping information.' However, it is not clear whether the new iPad will come with NFC functionality, which is used for contactless payments, as it relies on a Wi-Fi or mobile connection. Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets - available in silver and space grey - more similar to the Californian company’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours (pictured) Apple is preparing to launch a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales. The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite, and news iPads this month. 'A new line of iMacs with ultra high-resolution Retina Displays is in late testing stages within Apple, according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer,' said 9to5 Mac. 'While the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design, which was introduced in 2012, it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved Wi-Fi antennas,' it says. The firm will also launch a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite. The Yosemite software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if their iPhone is in another room. The software has also been overhauled with a new 'flat' look, and can search the web without having to open a browser. The software is the first to be overseen by Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive. Apple is also rumoured to be launching a larger iPad with a 12.9-inch screen next year, which if true, could offer 76 per cent more screen area than the current 9.7 inch models. The latest swathe of Apple tablets could come with a split screen function, which would allow users of an iPad to open two apps side-by-side on one screen. Sales of iPads have slumped for two quarters, after climbing from $5 billion (£3 billion) when they were launched in 2010, to $30 billion (£19 billion)  in 2012 and $32 billion in 2013 (£20 billion). The firm hasn't unveiled an updated iPad since last October when it launched the iPad Air and Mini and it appears that consumers have instead been drawn to smartphones with larger screens, including recently, Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, which has a 5.5 inch screen. Apple is not new to the strategy of launching colourful products to boost its sales. In 1999 it rolled out different coloured iMacs which were successful, but sales of its iPhone 5C – a ‘budget’ version of the iPhone 5S – have not sold as well as the company hoped. The company is expected to unveil the new iPads at the same time as a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales.

"So Ryan Giggs has taken his leave, in his 41st year, from the playing ranks of the only club he ever served. The hosannas ring loudly. Rio Ferdinand, his comrade in many Manchester United glories, joked that Giggs collected so many gold medals he puts BA Baracus, of A-Team fame, to shame. His c.v. includes two European Cups, 13 Premier League titles, four FA Cups and four League Cups, making him the most decorated player in the history of the English game. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ryan Giggs and Thierry Henry . A myth: Ryan Giggs can't be considered the greatest player in Premier League history, despite being the most decorated - his long career has been clouded by sentiment and wrapped in hyperbole . Mr Consistent: Giggs made a record 963 appearances in Red, scoring 168 goals . The best: Arsenal's former talisman Thierry Henry is the best ever player to grace the Premier League . Also to be . applauded was his quiet yet fierce work ethic. He husbanded his physical . gifts in a way redolent of the long careers of the old knights, Sir Tom . Finney and Sir Stanley Matthews. When he put on his suit for the first . match of his short stint as interim manager last month, he was as svelte . a figure as any seen on the touchline. The wiry, teenage Giggs had . preserved himself as if in aspic to play nearly 1,000 games for United. No . wonder the sportswriter Kevin Garside observed that Giggs was the rare . player ‘to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still on the pitch’. That, however, points to the problem with any critical appreciation of the man. He has become a myth. The facts have been clouded by sentiment and wrapped in hyperbole. Nothing demonstrated this more clearly than his being named 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year. He did not deserve the award on the evidence of those 12 months. It was bestowed on him in a fuzzy, sepia-tinged urge to recognise his longevity. Myths are not always outright lies, though. They are often fact embellished by fiction. So, even though Giggs only retired from playing yesterday, we should perhaps start to try to disentangle fact from fiction. And one fiction, it seems to me, is the assertion that he is the greatest player in the Premier League’s 22-year history. Winner: Giggs won 34 major honours in a glittering career at Old Trafford . Honours: They included 13 titles, four FA Cups and two Champions League titles . Invincibles: Arsenal players celebrate winning the league at White Hart Lane during their unbeaten season . Trademark: Henry scored 175 goals for Arsenal, the most by a player for a single club in the Premier League . I would contend that Thierry Henry, Arsenal’s most brillant light when they went uniquely unbeaten all season, is worthy of that accolade. His graceful speed, his incisive runs, his nerveless finishing have imprinted themselves most vividly on my mind. He scored 175 Premier League goals, more than anyone else at a single club. There are other worthy contenders: the miserly Keane, the footloose Ronaldo, the balletic Bergkamp, the forceful Vieira, the lethal Shearer, the ingenious Zola, the imperious Cantona, the skilful Scholes, the cottage industry of Gerrard. Giggs is worthy of comparison with them all, but we are left to ponder whether he entirely delivered on the promise that thrilled us when he was a 17-year-old winger with scampering feet. Undeserved: Giggs won the 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year as a nod to his longevity . Long game: Giggs burst on to the scene as a wiry teenager at the end of the 1990-91 season - before the formation of the Premier League . Match-winners: Eric Cantona (left), Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney (below) were always bigger stars when they played alongside Giggs - the Welshman was never the club's main man for any sustained period . He played on longer than any . contemporary, helped by his move from the wing to deep midfield in his . later years, yet he failed to become United’s star man for any sustained . period in any single phase of his career. There were always more . dependable game-changers, the likes of Eric Cantona, Cristiano Ronaldo, . Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. Even David Beckham deployed his more . limited attributes as a footballer to more clinical effect as a maker of . goals, from the right-side of midfield. Giggs . was bizarrely ineffectual in the final third of the pitch, too often . crossing in hope, as if happy to waft the responsibility on to others . rather than to seize it himself. The fact he did not often enough take . command of a game is reflected by his failure to win, or come close to . winning, the individual European or world honours that were handed to . Ronaldo and the young Michael Owen. He failed to move into the class of . the truly, global greats. (In . the spirit of fairness, I should acknowledge that my choice as the . Premier League’s greatest, Henry, did not win the Ballon d’Or either.) Lengthy: Sir Alex Ferguson converted Giggs from a flying winger to a crafty central midfielder . Better: Both Dennis Bergkamp (left) and Alan Shearer had a bigger impact on the Premier League than Giggs . Impact: Even David Beckham, with a more limited skill-set, was able to score and create more than Giggs did . Brilliant: Giggs scored a superb goal in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal but too often he was ineffectual . As for Giggs representing the best traditions of our national game, the verdict here is split. He was never sent off in a Manchester United shirt (though he was once for Wales). He withstood the sirens of riches and celebrity. But there were black marks against his saintly image: most notably, his long affair with his brother’s wife, of all people. He was a fine player, and even a dazzling one in his mop-haired youth. We are just saying, beware the myth.","The Manchester United legend may be the most decorated player in Premier League history but his legacy has been clouded by sentiment .
Thierry Henry is still the best to grace the league in its 22-year history .
Roy Keane, Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Cristiano Ronaldo and others can all claim to have had a bigger impact than the Welsh wizard .
Giggs was never Sir Alex Ferguson's star man for any sustained period ."
"Alan Knight - who scammed a neighbour out of £40,000 before claiming he was in a coma to avoid justice - has been jailed for four and half years . A fraudster who conned his frail neighbour out of more than £40,000 and thwarted justice for two years by pretending to be in coma has finally been jailed. Alan Knight cleaned out the bank accounts of dementia sufferer Ivor Richards, 86, after the pensioner was taken into a care home, Swansea Crown Court heard. The 47-year-old then falsely blamed his estranged son for the crime and even claimed he was in a vegetative state so couldn't stand trial. But CCTV footage showed him walking around on a shopping trip, prompting him to admit 19 charges of theft and forgery. Jailing him for four and a half years today, a judge said Knight was 'as dishonest a man as I have ever come across' who would 'stop at nothing in order to try and save his own skin'. The court heard Knight was living on benefits at his home in Swansea, South Wales, after claiming he had suffered a massive neck injury. He claimed his injury had caused him to have seizures which left him in a comatose state. His wife Helen, 33, claimed she had to care for her husband who had snapped his neck after falling backwards as he pulled down a garage door. But the whole time he was carrying out an elaborate fraud targeting neighbour Ivor Richards' life savings and shares over a three year period. The court heard how he 'systematically' funnelled £41,570 out of the pensioner's bank account which he used to pay for holidays and to buy a caravan in Dorset. It was later discovered that he had also forged Mr Richards’ will  using the names of two dead women from a newspaper’s obituary section as counter-signatories. The dad-of-three was caught on CCTV at the Severn bridge toll on the M4 as he travelled back from the south coast. He was also captured on CCTV in Tesco stores across the country after police traced the use of the family's loyalty club card. Scroll down for video . Knight admitted himself to hospital when police tried to bring him to justice, claiming he had suffered a serious injury in an accident in his garage . But doctors spotted Knight - pictured with wife, Helen - eating, wiping his face and writing while he was in hospital for observations . Officers tried to 'at least twice' to bring him court but each time he admitted himself to hospital claiming his condition had worsened. Swansea Crown Court was told he had 'pulled the wool' over his GP's eyes but he was unable to fool doctors at the hospital. While he was on 'observations' they spotted him eating, wiping his face and even writing. Knight was told he would have to stand trial even if he did not attend, and he finally appeared in court in a wheel chair and wearing a neck brace. He was going to contest the fraud and theft charges against him. But he changed his plea after the CCTV footage showed him walking around on a shopping trip. Jailing Knight today, Judge Paul Thomas said: 'Alan Knight is as dishonest a man as I have ever come across. 'Over a period of two years he took a man in his 80s for every penny he could. He took advantage of that gentleman's declining mental health. 'First he pretended to befriend him and then using this trust he systematically stole money that amounted to more than £40,000 which that gentleman had worked hard to build up most of his working life.' Police uncovered Knight's dishonesty when they saw him shopping in Tesco with his wife . A judge in Swansea said today that Knight would 'stop at nothing in order to try and save his own skin' The judge added: 'When these matters came to light he decided to do everything he could to avoid responsibility for his actions. 'He tried to blame his own son for what he had done - which resulted in him being arrested - and accused his own son of being bribed by a police officer. 'It is clear that Alan Knight would stop at nothing in order to try and save his own skin.' Judge Thomas jailed him for the fraud of Mr Richards and not for his alleged attempts to dodge justice with fake illnesses. The judge said it was now a police matter to investigate his illnesses. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Con Paul Harry, who lead the case, said: 'In my entire career this is the most calculated, long-term deception of a vulnerable, elderly neighbour I have ever seen. 'He had constantly avoided court for two years, costing police, the NHS and the court system thousands of pounds'. Knight, pictured arriving at court, finally admitted 19 charges of theft and forgery and has now been jailed .","Alan Knight, 47, conned his 86-year-old neighbour out of £40,000 .

"Garry Kasparov has revealed he believes Vladimir Putin to be a far bigger threat to the US than ISIS. The former world chess champion also accused the Russian leader of being 'the most dangerous man in the world'. Asked why he had issued such a stark warning, the political activist said that Putin 'plays poker while the rest of the world plays chess', warning that the Russian president's actions showed he had a tendency to try to call the world's bluff. Scroll down for video . Warning: Garry Kasparov claims Vladimir Putin is the 'most dangerous man in the world' He said Putin's next gamble would be to threaten to cut gas supplies to Europe and the former Soviet republics before the winter. Kasparov believes that the threat will be more than enough to force America and Europe to back down from their recent round of sanctions. In an interview with Yahoo News, the former grand master, 51, said: 'Putin is the most dangerous man in the world, a greater threat to the United States than the Islamic State.' And he attacked President Barack Obama for being too late in checking Putin's actions in Ukraine that eventually led to Russia annexing Crimea. Kasparov also slated European leaders, claiming that indifference to Putin's actions was similar to the complacency shown by leaders in the build-up to World War Two. He said it was hypocritical for the US and its allies to supply arms to Syrian rebels opposed to ISIS but to refuse to agree to similar requests from Ukraine. The 51-year-old also said the Islamic State militant group was simply a 'diversion' for the world to focus on. Garry Kasparov, above, believes Putin will threaten to cut gas supplies to Europe before the winter . But he said the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West would eventually work - but would only do so if they were left in place until at least March 2015. Kasparov believes Putin will use Russia's huge supply of natural gas as a bargaining chip ahead of what he dubbed the coming 'cold winter', threatening to shut down supplies to Europe and other former Soviet republics. Kasparov thinks that this threat could be enough to encourage an easing of penalties against Russia. He also believes Putin is telling his associates that the western governments 'will blink' and is simply calling the world's bluff – 'playing poker while everyone else is playing chess'. Kasparov, who once showed an interest in running for political office, said he now saw an uncertain future for Russia. 'We should forget about power in Russia changing hands throughout the election process. I'm afraid it will be not a very lawful process and it may eventually end up with the collapse of the country,' he said.","Former chess champion says Putin 'plays poker while the world plays chess'

"Fifty-six minutes gone at Wembley, a Peru move breaks down and Gary Cahill brings the ball out of defence. He gives the ball to Jordan Henderson, on to Steven Gerrard, and then Wayne Rooney virtually on the centre spot receives it. He’s on the half turn looking to get forward but is quickly closed down so lays it back to Cahill, and offers himself again. Adam Lallana gives him the ball, Rooney moves forward and taps it back to Lallana who runs into the space Rooney created. Again the Manchester United man wants it back, but Lallana’s pass is careless and Peru take up possession. There is a real threat because Glen Johnson is miles up the pitch. As England lost the ball he stood and watched and then decided to trot back. Rooney sees the danger straightaway and as Yotun passes out to the left to Ramirez, he sprints into the right back position and launches a perfectly timed tackle to snuff out the danger. Quiet night: Wayne Rooney struggled in front of goal against Peru but still put in a committed performance . Getting stuck in: Rooney slides in on Peru's Luis Ramirez during Friday's 3-0 win at Wembley . Frustrated figure: Rooney was deployed behind Daniel Sturridge as Roy Hodgson persisted with a 4-2-3-1 formation . That tackle happened right in front of where I was sitting with my son watching the game and it had to be perfectly timed. Get that one slightly wrong and it’s a yellow card. If that happens at a World Cup, it could prove costly. As the ball hit the advertising hoardings Johnson sauntered into the penalty area. Now I can’t say Rooney had a great game. Going forward it just didn’t happen for him at all. And a great tackle won’t save him from another disappointing World Cup if he doesn’t create and score for England in Brazil. But what I want to see from England players, even when they’re not playing well, is commitment, and that tackle showed why people are so wrong to call for Rooney to be dropped. When I read Mick Channon describing Rooney as the 'weak link' on Sportsmail last week I was shocked. The former Manchester City and Southampton striker is right that Rooney hasn’t delivered at a World Cup, but he’s only the weak link if he offers less than the rest. At his best Rooney is a hard-working goalscorer and a creator. At his worst he is a team player. Rooney doesn’t deserve the criticism. He has earned the right with performances and goals for his club and country for us all to debate how to get the best out of him, rather than lazily writing him off. The problem Rooney has is that because he is so good at everything, his true strength is overlooked. He is a goalscorer – a goal machine. Check out how brilliant Rooney was in the 2011-12 Premier League season for Manchester United. He scored 34 goals in 43 games, back-to-back Premier League hat-tricks, the first when he was man of the match in United’s record-breaking 8-2 demolition of Arsenal. He was an out-and-out striker at that point. A change of position, playing a deeper role, has led to some doubting his United credentials. Rested: Rooney is replaced by Liverpool midfielder Raheem Sterling after 66 minutes on Friday night . Danger man: Daniel Sturridge continued his good form with a stunning strike against Peru . Familiar sight: Sturridge has become England's main goal threat after a standout season for Liverpool . Same with England – he is well on the way to breaking Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring record. But in the 4-2-3-1, he plays behind lone striker and has become less of a goal threat. England have two fantastic centre forwards in Daniel Sturridge and Rooney, play them both up front, put a diamond behind them – with Gerrard deep, Raheem Sterling at the point, James Milner or Henderson on one side and Lallana on the other, and you have a better chance of getting the very best out of Rooney who let’s not forget is, on his day, England’s best player. Problem is he doesn’t have enough of those days and he hasn’t had any of them at a World Cup. Yet.","Rooney was played behind Daniel Sturridge in England's 3-0 win against Peru on Friday .

"Kate, 32, who is around 11 weeks pregnant with her second child with husband, Prince William, is said to have pulled out of a trip to Portsmouth, Hampshire . The Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly pulled out of another official engagement because she is still suffering from severe morning sickness. Kate, 32, who is around 11 weeks pregnant with her second child with husband, Prince William, is said to have pulled out of a trip to Portsmouth, Hampshire, on Monday. She had been planning to visit Olympic sailor Sir Ben Ainslie's America's Cup team at its new £12million headquarters at Camber Docks in Old Portsmouth. However, it was reported today that she has been forced to cancel the official visit next week because she continues to suffer from hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe vomiting condition which saw her hospitalised in the early weeks of her pregnancy with her first baby, Prince George, now one. The Express reported that a royal source had confirmed Kate's trip to Portsmouth had been cancelled and said she had no plans to undertake any other official engagements before next week. Kensington Palace said: 'Her engagements are being reviewed on a case by case basis. Any future engagements will be announced in due course.' It is the latest in a string of official engagements to be cancelled by the Duchess as she continues to battle the vomiting condition. Last week, she had to cancel an appearance at a new project in London, organised by The Art Room - one of the charities of which is she patron. At the time, Kensington Palace said the Duchess was 'hugely disappointed' at having to pull out. The Duchess did, however, send a personally-penned message to be read out to the disappointed children. In it she apologised for not being there, saying she was 'truly sorry' at having to cancel, but promised to see the venue for herself soon. Her cancelled engagements have set tongues wagging that she may be pregnant with twins, with one leading doctor explaining that a multiple pregnancy can make morning sickness worse. Speaking to the MailOnline, Consultant Gynaecologist Dr Andrew Paterson said: 'HCG is a pregnancy hormone secreted by the placenta and in twins, far more of this hormone is released. 'As HCG is associated with nausea women carrying twins can experience worse morning sickness. 'In fact one of the first things we do if a woman comes to me experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum is scan them, not only to check the baby but also to check for twins. Scroll down for video . The Duchess was expected to meet Sir Ben Ainslie's America's Cup team in Portsmouth, Hampshire, on Monday but has reportedly pulled out due to morning sickness. Pictured: Kate with Sir Ben in London in June . Kate, who is around 11 weeks pregnant, suffered the same illness in her first pregnancy with Prince George . The Duchess’s last official engagement was on August 5 when she opened a poppy installation at the Tower of London with her husband William (together above) and Prince Harry . 'It is obviously not a hard and fast rule and pregnancy differs with every woman.' Leila Hanna, Consultant Gynaecologist and Obstetrician at Queen Mary's Hospital in London and BMI The Sloane Hospital, added: 'In twins expectant mothers experience twice the hormones, and so often twice the sickness.' As a result of Kate's severe morning sickness, Kensington Palace has been unusually circumspect about announcing engagements. The Duchess has not been seen in public since news of her pregnancy was released by Kensington Palace last month. Her last official engagement was on August 5 when she opened a poppy installation at the Tower of London with her husband William and Prince Harry. Her pregnancy has not yet passed the 12-week stage but there is speculation that the royal couple's second child could be due in April. Her pregnancy has not yet passed the 12-week stage but there is speculation the baby could be due in April . The Queen's surgeon-gynaecologist Alan Farthing (pictured) is part of the Duchess's medical team . Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies. The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception. It causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis. It is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers. The severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences. They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week. It can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food. Hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat. Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated. Treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition. An intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice. The condition can also affect the baby’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight.

His personal favourite was Nony Nony, seven times Gold Cup winner in England. As well as teaching Princes William and Harry, he also played several times with them. He once said of the pair: 'My experience with the Royal Family was really something very special because they are true princes. 'I remember an anecdote from a training session in which Prince William arrived four or five minutes late for a class and said sorry more than anyone I've ever met in my life. They are fantastic people.' Recalling the day the Queen's eldest grandson introduced him to Kate Middleton he said: 'Prince William told Kate, ""This person is the best polo player ever, he's a legend and he's the best and my father thinks the same.'""

"Corporal Mark Kershaw, 27, had just got back from his third tour of duty in Helmand Province  when he was head-butted and kicked in the attack in Hull . An Army hero who was savagely beaten after returning to the UK from fighting in Afghanistan was banned from wearing his medals at their trial in case his bravery influenced the jury. Corporal Mark Kershaw, 27, had just got back from his third tour of duty in Helmand Province with Operation Herrick 18 when he was head-butted and kicked to the ground in the cowardly attack. He was targeted after trying to stop a woman and two drunken men who were verbally abusing a senior taxi warden on George Street in Hull town centre. The suspects were subsequently arrested and during their trial at Hull Crown Court this week, Cpl Kershaw was told by defence barrister Ian Stuart-Brook that he should remove his Afghanistan campaign medal and Jubilee medal from 'public sight'. The lawyer argued that he should not be wearing them in public because 'it would have an unfair effect on the jury underlining his status as a decorated soldier'. Judge Mark Bury, agreed, despite Cpl Kershaw's protest that he had been given permission to wear the medals by a senior officer at his Household Cavalry unit in Windsor in the seven days before Remembrance Sunday. Cpl Kershaw, who was commended for his bravery in Afghanistan, arrived each day with his medals but was forced to take them off and put them in his pocket after the judge ruled the ban should remain in place for the entire four days of the trial. Despite the ban on his medals, the two defendants who kicked the soldier to the ground were allowed to wear poppies in court during the trial. The decision sparked outrage among Cpl Kershaw's family and war veterans on the concourse of the court. Cpl Kershaw told the court from the witness stand how his was attacked on his first night out after returning from a seven-month tour of duty of Afghanistan on November 23 last year. The special unit solider had completed tours of Afghanistan in 2007, 2009 and 2013 - a total of 22 months - and had been commended for bravery. During the conflict, he was caught up in a bomb explosion and now has shrapnel embedded next to his spine. Four of his friends also died during the tours. The corporal said he was waiting in a taxi queue in Hull town centre when he was head-butted by a woman and then jumped on by two men who were with her. He said he had been waiting in the taxi queue when the woman, Beverley Logen, 27, began abusing a taxi marshal. 'People were watching what was happening and doing nothing,' Cpl Kershaw told the court. 'I was trying to be a peacemaker. I saw him getting verbally abused. I told her to let him do his job. 'The next thing I knew, was she turned around and head-butted me in the face. My nose exploded. I went to the ground and people stamped on my head and kicked me.' Craig Hood , 27, (right) and Lee Wareham, 34, (left) both denied causing Cpl Kershaw actual bodily harm, but were found guilty following a four day trial at Hull Crown Court this week. They will be sentenced next month . Logen, who has previous convictions for assault, pleaded guilty on her first appearance in court. However, her husband Craig Hood , 27, of Burton-upon-Stather, near Scunthorpe, and Lee Wareham, 34, of Gateshead, both denied causing Cpl Kershaw actual bodily harm and went on trial this week. Taxi marshall Alistair Storey told the jury. 'I have never in my life witnessed anything like it. 'The woman just put her head back and head-butted him. His nose just exploded. 'All three of them started kicking him and raining punches. They were screaming: ""Let's have him!"" 'All three of them stamped on him and kicked him. Both males stamped on him when he was on the floor. It was a cowardly trick.' Eyewitness Lewis Foster said: 'All he said was ""let him do his job"". 'The girl head-butted Mark in the face. The two men came round fists flying in Mark's direction.' Both men were unanimously convicted after the four-day trial and Judge Bury told them: 'You have both been convicted of a nasty attack on a man who was concerned about the level of abuse Beverley Logen was using on a person doing his public duty. 'I am satisfied, that although Beverley Logen started this, you both played a part. 'In particular this involved punching and kicking someone who was doing nothing more than standing up for someone else. 'You Hood have a conviction for threatening behaviour. You must both understand you are at risk of being sent to prison. That must follow when there was this level of violence.' The judge deferred sentencing until December 12 pending a probation report. After the trial, Cpl Kershaw revealed how he had been asked not to speak to the press because of security concerns for his unit's future operations in the wake of the heightened terror threat. Cpl Kershaw was left with a bloody nose and swelling after being head-butted and kicked in the attack last year . Hull Royal British Legion veteran Charles Jenneson said it was a disgrace the corporal had been banned from wearing his medals. He said: 'They are the Queen's medals and he was giving evidence in the Queen's Court. 'The Judge was wrong to make him take them off. He would not have dreamed of asking a World War Two veteran to remove them.' Cpl Kershaw's uncle, Alan Kershaw, 47, said he was also outraged that his nephew had been told by the judge to remove his medals. 'It's an absolute disgrace,' the lorry driver said. 'Mark has earned those medals and he fully expected to be able to wear them in court. 'He has been shot at, blown up, and seen four of his friends killed in Afghanistan. He has given first-aid to wounded Afghans and been mentioned in dispatches for his bravery. 'Yet the jury was told none of this. He came to the court as a victim of crime and he was treated like this. This man has fought for his country and has seen men die. He should be allowed to wear them. Cpl Mark Kershaw was given an Afghanistan campaign medal and a Jubilee medal for his bravery . 'I know he wanted to show his support to the old boys who are wearing them. He won't be able to return to his Remembrance parade in Windsor, this Sunday because he has been in court all week, so he got permission to wear them in court. 'He doesn't wear them in the street. It has just added insult to injury. I was livid when I heard he was attacked on his first night out from Afghanistan. 'The word cowardly rightly sums them up. I am glad they got him when he was on the ground. He would have made a real mess of them if he had wanted to fight.' Shipley Tory MP Philip Davies added: 'It is appalling that a judge ordered a war hero to remove the medals he won so bravely serving his country. 'Soldiers should be free to wear their war medals at all times. This soldier was not on trial, he was the victim of a crime, and the wearing of his medals had no bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant. 'If the judge thinks that the jury are so stupid that they cannot see past the medals of a victim to determine the guilt or innocence of someone else then perhaps he shouldn't be a judge at all.' Meanwhile Beverley and Holderness MP Graham Stuart agreed the judge's decision was wrong. He said: 'If it is true that the thugs were allowed to wear poppies, while a soldier, a victim, was forced to hide the symbols of his heroism in open court, then it is a disgrace. 'We can't allow this perversion where thugs rights are sacrosanct and decent people's rights are trampled upon. If that is the culture in some court then it needs to change and change urgently.'","Corporal Mark Kershaw attacked while waiting for taxi in Hull town centre .

"No sooner had the players finished their lap of honour than the work began through the night to turn  Wembley Stadium into a venue fit for a grudge match. They will bay for blood when Carl Froch and George Groves collide but England skipped off on their Brazilian adventure with frivolity in the air. There were paper planes, Mexican waves and beach balls bobbing in the stands. Very few of those present expect Roy Hodgson and his team to return with the trophy, but Brazil is the home of carnival and most were ready to commit to the spirit. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Roy Hodgson . Parade: Steven Gerrard applauds the fans as the England players walk round the pitch after the game . Packed house: Gerrard crosses the ball during the friendly against Peru at Wembley Stadium . We should be relieved. Thirty years ago, England fans would have been ready to perform their own tribute to the Brazilian riots. There has been a huge change in the demographic and a change in expectations. On Friday night the crowd were unfailingly positive, and they were rewarded with goals. This is Hodgson’s Bossa Nova, his new wave. ‘Get Set Go’ said the front of the match-day programme. The England manager addressed the crowd pre-match from the big screens behind each goal. This was it. Roy and his lions, off to the jungle saddling supporters of a certain generation with a ‘Tight Fit’ tune in their heads, even if lions don’t live in the jungle. The steamy rainforest climate, however, seemed a long way off on a cool May evening. Fans watched in hats and scarves but South America still infiltrated Wembley. Pensive: England manager Roy Hodgson looks on as he watches his side beat Peru 3-0 . Plane sailing: England goalkeeper Joe Hart throws a paper aeroplane after it landed on the pitch . There was the samba band before kick-off and of course the Peruvians, intent on giving England a tough pre-tournament test. England were preparing for a World Cup in Chile when they last played Peru. That was in Lima in 1962 and Jimmy Greaves scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 win. The aim on Friday night was the same. Hodgson wanted his players to sample the rhythms of South American opponents, to tackle some of the inevitable frustrations that come with football on that continent. Rinaldo Cruzado’s reckless assault on Steven Gerrard might not have attracted attention in the ’62 World Cup but he was rightly booked on Friday night. Gerrard climbed to his feet and shook his head, unimpressed. Crunching challenge: Peru's Rinaldo Cruzado (bottom left) goes in hard on England captain Gerrard . It was not a warm-up-friendly sort of tackle, but it was a timely reminder that England need their captain fit and healthy for several reasons. On his 34th birthday, winning cap No 110, he is close to irreplaceable as a leader and a holding midfielder. Here was a lesson in patience. Do not lose the plot when a team defends deep and with resolve. Do not react when on the receiving end of a hefty midfield challenge. Wayne Rooney and David Beckham have cracked in the past and seen red. Peru broke up play, interfered with England’s tempo and threatened on the break. Hodgson looked on and rubbed his chin. He had, by his own admission, talked a lot over the last couple of weeks. Had any of it sunk in? Maybe. Hodgson allowed himself an air-punch of delight when Daniel Sturridge curled in a left-footer from the edge of the area. Sturridge looked dangerous. Joe Hart was solid.

And while the support was impressive, they probably will not be too in awe of anything they saw on the pitch.

"Comedian Tracy Morgan said he has been left in disbelief after Walmart blamed him for a deadly crash with one of their truck drivers. Morgan was left seriously injured after a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus on the New Jersey Turnpike in June. His close friend James McNair was killed and two others were injured. The group are suing Walmart for negligence because it is believed that the truck driver, Kevin Roper, had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the deadly collision. On Monday the company tried to dodge responsibility, saying Morgan and his friends are partly to blame for their injuries because they were not wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Morgan responded: 'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused.' The former 30 Rock star said he felt like he had to respond publicly to Walmart's latest claim, adding that he and his friends did nothing wrong. Scroll down for video . Walmart is blaming comedian Tracy Morgan for the injuries he sustained in June when a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus. His friend James McNair was also killed and two others were injured . Morgan and friend were returning from a comedy show in Delaware when the Walmart truck collided with their limo bus in June . Morgan's friend James McNair was killed in the crash while accompanying the 45-year-old former Saturday Night Live star back from a show in Delaware. Morgan spent several weeks in rehab with rib and leg injuries. Walmart Stores Inc., who are based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said in their Monday court filing that the passengers' injuries were caused by their 'failure to properly wear an appropriate available seatbelt restraint device,' which it says constitutes unreasonable conduct. If they had been wearing a restraint, Walmart argues that 'all or a portion of the injuries could have been diminished or minimized'. An attorney representing Morgan and the other plaintiffs has not commented. Walmart didn't respond to claims that their driver, Kevin Roper, hadn't slept in more than 24 hours before the crash. Morgan spent several weeks in rehab with rib and leg injuries. Pictured on the left using a walker in New York with his fianceé Megan Wollover (left) in July.

The company did admit though that Morgan and his friends' injuries 'may have been caused by third parties over whom Walmart had no control'. After the deadly crash, Roper was charged with causing the accident. Investigators believe he was dozing off behind the wheel in the moments before the collision and didn't see the traffic ahead of him until it was too late. '[The] driver failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead,' New Jersey State Police Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said. 'He observed at the last minute -- just prior to impact -- the limo bus carrying Morgan and his party.'

"Chinese engineers have tested a laser weapon that can shoot down drones and small aircraft from more than a mile away. The weapon system is designed to protect major public gatherings from drone attack,and can destroy low-flying, slow moving aircraft. The Low Altitude Sentinel system was developed by the China Academy of Engineering Physics. Scroll down for video . China has announced it has developed its own laser system to counter the threat posed by small drones . Chinese officials fear the drones could be used to attack large public events  such as military parades . According to Chinese State media the laser is able to destroy low-level slow-moving drones within five seconds . According to a report in the English-language China Daily, the laser can hit drones travelling below 1,600 feet at a speed of up to 110mph. China's Xinhau News Agency reported the new weapon system could be mounted to vehicles and deployed to protect major public events. Yi Jinsong, who is involved with developing the project said: 'Intercepting such drones is usually the work of snipers and helicopters, but their success rate is not as high and mistakes with accuracy can result in unwanted damage.' The United States has developed its own laser technology, with a prototype weapon fitted to a naval vessel to target drones and small aircraft. According to Chinese officials, their new system can shoot down a rogue drone within five seconds of detecting its target. The reported development comes as concerns about the country's military preparedness are being raised in state media. A front page article in China's official military newspaper last month said that weaknesses in military training posed a threat to the country's ability to fight and win a war. The US Navy has already successfully tested laser weaponry on board the USS Dewey, pictured . The paper - the People's Liberation Army Daily - said in the same report that China's military authorities had sent a document out to units detailing 40 weaknesses in current training methods. President Xi Jinping has been pushing to strengthen the fighting ability of China's 2.3 million-strong armed forces as they project power across disputed waters in the East and South China Seas. China has developed stealth jets and has built one aircraft carrier. The country's armed forces, the world's largest, came under criticism earlier this year from serving and retired Chinese officers and state media, who questioned whether they were too corrupt to win a war. Andrew Davies, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said: 'Whether you can shoot down a maneuvering, robust drone with a hard surface, perhaps with heat dissipation designed in, is something I'm not sure about, but it's at least plausible.'","The new laser system can hit a drone travelling at up to 110mph at 1,600 feet .

"Ronald Koeman believes his Southampton side has the beating of Chelsea and Manchester City - but only over 90 minutes and not the course of a season. The Dutchman has led Saints to second place in the Barclays Premier League after replacing Mauricio Pochettino over the summer, with a number of his recruits already starting to make names for themselves in the division. Graziano Pelle was brought in from Koeman's former club Feyernoord and, as well as scoring on his Italy debut, he has notched six league goals and picked up the player of the month award for September. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman believes his side are good enough to beat Chelsea and Manchester City . Summer signing Graziano Pelle (left) has been a revelation at the club, scoring six league goals so far this term . Dusan Tadic (left) has also impressed at St Mary's and has been nominated for October player of the month . Dusan Tadic has arguably had an even better start, with the Serbia winger up for the October award having starred in the 8-0 demolition of Sunderland. Leicester are the visitors to the south coast on Saturday before a tough run of fixtures that will see Koeman's side face Man City, Arsenal and Manchester United in the space of eight days. Reigning champions City are currently third in the table with runaway leaders Chelsea looking almost unstoppable, but Koeman believes his Southampton charges could deal blows to either side's title hopes, even if Saints cannot last the pace to challenge for the crown. 'I think it is a two-team race because I still believe that City and Chelsea are stronger over the whole season,' he said. Eden Hazard (left) and Sergio Aguero scored Chelsea and City's winning goals at the weekend . 'In one game I think we can beat them but over the whole season normally they are much stronger than us. 'We know our situation and we know our ambitions but we live game by game, and it is not important and not necessary to look more forward because, in my opinion, that is not the best way to be successful. 'Of course we would like to continue in the good direction the club has been going in the last three or four years. The next step is playing in Europe, we know that. 'It is a dream for the club and a dream for the fans. We have to do it but I have confidence that we can reach that.' Koeman (second left) congratulates his players after they won 1-0 away at Hull on Saturday . The Foxes travel to St Mary's having lost four of their last five matches and without a win since their famous 5-3 victory over Man United. But, with a stern test to come in the run-in to Christmas, Koeman believes Nigel Pearson's men will still prove a threat. 'We know our schedule for the month of December and the end of November and we will have a tough week at the start of December, but we look forward to that,' he said. 'It gives us the possibilities to play well and see what we can do against the big ones, but the first one we have to play is this weekend against Leicester and maybe that is more difficult than playing Man City.' Saints have a fully-fit squad for Saturday's clash against Leicester bar the long-term injury to Jay Rodriguez . Other than long-term injury absentee Jay Rodriguez, Koeman has a fully-fit squad at his disposal for the weekend and the former Barcelona midfielder believes current form, which has seen Southampton win 10 of their last 11 fixtures in all competitions, is key as no player wants to miss out on such a run. 'The team and the players are still in good shape, we don't have injuries. The team is fit and full of confidence,' said Koeman. 'We had a good pre-season, that is important, and we have time between the weekends to do training sessions because we don't play European football. 'We are winning, that is the most important motivation to be in a good shape in a physical way because it is easier to keep going.'","Southampton sit second in the Premier League table after 10 matches .

"Shocking: Jessica Ridgeway's family are 'disgusted' her name is being used in a political attack ad . The family of murdered Colorado schoolgirl Jessica Ridgeway are furious after a a Democratic group sent out a political attack ad that sought to capitalize on her horrific death. Priorities for Colorado, which is funded by a slew of unions and other liberal groups, sent out a mailer attacking Republican State House candidate Susan Kochevar, accusing her of 'refusing to cooperate' with the investigation into the 10-year-old's disappearance in October 2012. Jessica's grandmother Christine Ridgeway told KUSA-TV that she heard of the flyer on October 5 - the second anniversary of Jessica's kidnapping in the Denver suburb of Westminster, Colorado. 'I am just totally disgusted by this. When I first saw this I was speechless for like four hours. I was just so angry and so upset that I just couldn't speak,' she said. Democratic State Rep Tracy Kraft-Tharp, who is campaigning against Ms Kochevar, denounced the ad and said no one in her campaign had anything to do with it. Priorities Colorado spent nearly $290,000 in less than two weeks in September. Its donors include Education Reform Now, a New York-based teachers group; groups founded by Denver tech millionaire Tim Gill; and the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Jessica stepped out her door on October 5, 2012 for a short walk to a neighbor boy's house and then to school. Her disappearance petrified her town and horrified the country. The FBI and local police went door-to-door questioning neighbors and asking to search homes as they hunted for Jessica and her killer. Ms Kochevar, who lives near Jessica's home, has revealed that FBI agents came to her door on three occasions. She said she answered their questions, but would not let them search her house. Police eventually arrested Austin Sigg, a 17-year-old neighbor who admitted to kidnapping Jessica, raping her and then strangling her to death before he cut her body to pieces. He is serving life in prison. Playing dirty: This mailer, funded by liberal group Priorities for Colorado, invokes the frantic search for Jessica Ridgeway in the name of scoring political points . Attacked: Susan Kochevar, a Republican from Jessica's hometown, is running for a seat in the State House. The ad blasted her for not letting the FBI search her home during door-to-door sweeps . Ms Kochevard has defended not letting federal agents search her house by saying that she was standing up for her Constitutional rights. 'If one wants to have a discussion about why it is important to stand for your rights, we can have that conversation,' she said in a statement to political blog Colorado Peak Politics. 'But to show no regard for the victim’s family is sickening.' Mrs Ridgeway told KUSA that she doesn't blame Ms Kochevar for not letting agents into her home. But, she said the ad could turn her off politics for good. 'It's just a new level of smear that doesn't make me feel like I want to vote at all, really. I don't want to vote,' she said.","Jessica Ridgeway was abducted on her way to school then raped, murdered and dismembered in Westminster, Colorado, in 2012 .

"Young people will struggle to find work unless employers are willing to offer them work experience, Esther McVey warns today. The Employment Minister urged firms to follow the example of the TV show The Apprentice, where aspiring bosses of the future are put through their paces under the watchful gaze of Lord Sugar. Miss McVey told MailOnline that employers should do everything they can to 'inspire the next generation' who will continue to lack the necessary skills without being given the chance to experience the world of work. Scroll down for video . Employment minister Esther McVey told MailOnline employers should run Apprentice-style challenges to give young people experience of the world of work . Ministers fear that many young people face a vicious circle of being told they need to get more experience before they can land a job, but cannot get a job to get the experience. Miss McVey claims shows like The Apprentice, where candidates gaining work experience by undertaking a series of tasks, can act as inspiration for employers to open their doors to young people trying to enter the jobs market. More than a quarter of a million young people have taken part in employer-led placements or work experience through Jobcentre Plus since January 2011, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. Miss McVey said: 'It's the age old problem – the young people I meet tell me they need work experience to get a job, but they need a job to get work experience. 'That's why we hugely increased the number of work experience placements available and why our advisers in Jobcentre Plus work closely with local businesses to provide tailored training opportunities for young jobseekers across the UK. Work experience works.' Latest figures show that in the three months to July, 16.6 per cent of 16-24-year-olds were unemployed, down from 21 per cent a year earlier, but still higher than the 13.8 per cent seen in early 2008. Overall, 747,000 people aged 16-24 are unemployed people. Lord Sugar returns with his advisers Baroness Brady (left) and Nick Hewer (right) with a new series of The Apprentice on Tuesday night . Miss McVey suggested successful businesses had a key part to play in getting them into work. She said: 'People who have been successful in business have a huge amount to offer young people who are just starting out. 'They know about the drive and determination it takes to work your way up through the ranks, or to set up in business and go it alone. 'This kind of first hand experience can be invaluable in inspiring our young people to work hard and build a career. 'I'd like to appeal to bosses around the country to do everything they can to inspire the next generation. 'Our young people are some of the best and most talented in the world - they are driven, entrepreneurial and innovative, and with the help of people who have already made it in the world of work, they can go on to be the bosses and employers of the future. 'As the new series of the Apprentice starts I'd encourage a generation of young people to consider getting work experience and support from us to make their dream of being their own boss become a reality.' In the show, over-ambitious would-be bosses are put through a series of tests, which Miss McVey argues are a good way of showing young people the realities of running a business . However, last year Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said The Apprentice should change its name because the bizarre challenges and on-the-spot sackings could put people off starting apprenticeships. 'I know that The Apprentice is designed to be dramatic television viewing but it has very little to do with apprentices – people who are doing a serious piece of vocational training,' he said. 'I worry that whatever the attractions of the programme as a piece of TV theatre, it gives people a completely false impression about what being an apprentice actually involves.' The Apprentice returns to BBC One on Tuesday night at 9pm.","Esther McVey tells MailOnline how firms must 'inspire the next generation'

"A Queensland mother who received an anonymous note from neighbours complaining about her crying baby has urged them to come forward and hit out at her detractors for being 'so critical'. Trish LaForty, 26, found the letter in her mailbox last Thursday after a day out with her 11-month-old son Will, which read: 'You may be able to ignore your baby crying but we are tired of listening to him crying non-stop all day.' The mother, who lives in a Sunshine Coast apartment block with her son and partner Wil, posted a response and a copy of the note to a local community Facebook page and has since received global media attention. Trish LaForty, 26, found a 'rude' note in her mailbox last week after a day out with her 11-month-old son Will . The Sunshine Coast mother posted it to a community Facebook page and has since received global attention . 'I had no idea that it was this worldwide until this morning my dad said that I should Google my name, and it came up in all these different languages and I just thought ""Wow that's crazy"",' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I definitely wasn't expecting that when I put the little rant on Facebook.' Ms LaForty wrote the post on the Sunny Coast Community Board in the hope the letter's authors would see it. 'Like being a parent isn't tough enough... You didn't even have the guts to come knock on our door,' she posted on the Facebook page. 'FYI Our baby doesn't cry ""all day"", he cries when he doesn't want do go to sleep, when he's getting his nappy changed and when I say ""no"" because I refuse to let him be spoiled and run around like he owns the joint. 'If you'd like to chat more, feel free to pop in. You obviously know where we live.' Ms LaForty who lives in an apartment block with her son and partner Wil (pictured right), denied that her baby cried 'for hours on end' The 26-year-old her has urged her neighbours to come forward and told detractors to stop being 'so critical' Ms LaForty and her partner still don't know who sent the note, but they have their suspicions. 'We've talked to a couple of other neighbours and another lady in our block had received notes from somebody as well,' she said. 'Just about petty little things as well, like that they could hear their birds. 'I don't know if they're going to come forward now because they might be shamed.' But Ms LaForty still wants the people who sent the note to come talk to her face-to-face. 'I guess I kind of hope that they would do that so maybe we could resolve whatever issues they seem to have,' she said. 'But if they don't that's not really our problem, it's them that are going to have to put up with our baby.' Many have jumped to Ms LaForty's defence but others have accused her of having a 'superiority complex' Ms LaForty said after she posted the note on Facebook many people jumped to her defence, and she thought the issue had struck a nerve because of the way the situation was handled by her neighbours. 'People really believe that kids should be kids and it's part of growing up,' she said. 'But more so because of the way it was handled. 'The writer could have given more information or at least said who they were if they're really that concerned about our baby, instead of writing a rude note.' And while many have jumped to Ms LaForty's defence, others have accused her of having a 'superiority complex'. 'Eurgh, I'd write that letter. Nothing worse than non stop barking dogs and screeching children. Sick of the ""everyone should bow down to those who procreate"". Shut em up!,' one reader wrote. Ms LaForty said the issue struck a nerve because of the way the situation was handled by her neighbours . Another reader said: 'I don't see anything ""insulting"" about the letter. It may be seen as impatient or unsympathetic, but it's definitely not insulting. 'She sounds like one of those mothers who think that because she's got a baby, everyone else in the world must go out of their way to accommodate her.' But Ms LaForty just dismisses her critics as 'trolls' and denies her son Will is as noisy as her neighbours say. 'If they're going to have children they're going to find out what it's like eventually,' she said. 'Maybe instead of being so critical they can offer a helping hand.' Ms LaForty added: 'Will is not upset all the time or crying for hours on end. 'I'd be the first to admit it if my child was a terror.'","Trish LaForty, 26, found a handwritten note in her mailbox on Thursday .

"Andy Murray’s French Open hopes were left hanging by a worn racket string when he finished an extraordinary twilight deciding set with it poised at 7-7 and the clock glowing at 9.39pm. The Wimbledon champion will need to come back on Sunday for a sudden-death shootout, the like of which he has never known before in a Grand Slam, if he is to squeeze his way past the gritty German Philipp Kohlschreiber. Murray will resume at 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 7-7 in his third round with three hours and 27 minutes already played, having traipsed home to bed wondering why he had not wrapped things up in time for a hearty supper. Great Scot: Murray is a study of concentration as he plays a backhand on Saturday night . On a roll: The British No 1 will sleep with the game at 7-7 as they battle for a place in the fourth round . He . led 3-0 in the fourth set and 2-0 in the fifth - he also led by a break . of serve in all five sets - and faces a huge test of nerve as the . opportunity to go deep into this tournament presents itself. Clutching . at his left hamstring and moving stiffly at times towards the end, . continually chuntering at himself during changeovers, he could not put . away the highly skilled German, who deserves plenty of credit for . refusing to go quietly. Kohlschreiber even managed to get a break up . at 3-2, only for the occasion to get to him and allow Murray to hold on . amid cliff-edge drama that should never really have been necessary. Murray . so rarely loses these kind of matches at Grand Slams, and this was . further evidence just how tough the whole journey returning from back . surgery has been. From dominating the fourth set, it seemed he got . distracted by trying to finish things off for the night, and the price . is that he must come back this afternoon to finish what is the longest . fifth set of his career. Murray needed to produce an immaculately . timed backhand to save a break-point at 6-6 which would have allowed . Kohlschreiber to serve for the match. It truly was an evening of living . dangerously. Wavered: Kohlschreiber took the first and fourth sets while Murray claimed the second and third . Then, with adrenalin surging through both players, he . had a simpler backhand from mid-court in the next game that would have . given him match-point, only to fractionally drag it wide. By the close . he was gesturing to suggest he was struggling to see the ball, and it . required all his bloody-minded determination to save himself, plus the . assistance of the tour physio at three consecutive changeovers, who was . called out to administer a rub to his thighs. Everyone could have used a  calming massage after this one. He needs to steel himself once again, but the fact remains that his . self-belief is not quite the same on clay as it is on other surfaces. Murray . knew full well what a dangerous opponent he faced, having been thrashed . by him in Monte Carlo four years ago, and knowing that the German was . coming into this on a six-match winning streak. His looping . groundstrokes give him high net clearance and consistency, and at the . start he was swift to attack two of Murray’s weaker areas in quickly . recovering from an early break down to reel off five games and take the . opener. Murray’s second serve has looked a little vulnerable this week and his opponent attacked anything short. Time out: Murray receives treatment from the trainer for a thigh injury but plays on . Ups and downs: Murray tries to see the lighter side of things during a tumultuous third round match . He . also benefited from erratic forehand play from the British No 1, who . repeatedly drove the ball into the net, especially when he was pushed . out wide, which can sometimes be the case. With no heavyweight figure . in his box like Ivan Lendl, we saw more of the tendency to turn around . and curse in his corner’s direction — something which never bodes well. Waiting game: Murray will finish the match in the morning . A . backhand volley into the net sealed the opener on Kohlschreiber’s fifth . set-point, but the heart-ening factor for Murray was that he always . knew he would have  openings against the German’s serve, not his . strongest suit. The Scot regrouped impressively and broke for 2-0, . only for Kohlschreiber to return the compliment three games later. Murray attacked the Kohlschreiber serve again and when he broke for 4-2 . was able to serve out and level the match. In the third, Murray made . a judicious foray to the net after a deep drive to break for 3-2 and . then rubbed in the advantage with another break at 5-3 to put himself in . firm control of proceedings with the sun beginning to set. At 3-0 in . the fourth he was in utter command, then threw in two double- faults . and lost his service rhythm — and the next five out of six games — to . send it into a decider. Today promises to be another white-knuckle ride, . albeit a much briefer one. Jamie Murray’s doubles run came to an . end as he and Australian partner John Peers lost to Bob and Mike Bryan . in the third round. Murray was playing at this stage at Roland Garros . for the first time, but the defending champion Bryan brothers won 6-3, . 6-1 in 49 minutes.","Play resumes in third round French Open match on Sunday .

"Resplendent in brightly coloured silks and neatly pressed suits, professional dancers from all over the world descended on Blackpool this week to compete at the Blackpool Dance Festival. The world's largest ballroom dancing competition has received a boost in recent years courtesy of enormously popular BBC show, Strictly Come Dancing, and as a result, the festival attracted a record 2,953 couples from 60 different countries last year.

The festival, which has been a key part of the ballroom dancing calendar since 1920, is staged in the huge Empress Ballroom at the Victorian Winter Gardens entertainment complex and started life as a novelty dance competition. Early incarnations included country and Morris dancing but both were dropped after two years. Instead 'stage dancing', the precursor of modern ballroom dancing, was allowed to dominate, with more dances added each year. After a one-year break in 1928, the Blackpool Dance Festival was relaunched in June 1929, with events that included the North of England Professional and Amateur Championships, an Amateur Veleta Competition, a Veterans Waltz Competition plus an Original Sequence Dance Competition.

In 1931, as 'English dancing' continued to develop, the Blackpool Dance Festival became home to the first British Professional and Amateur Ballroom Championships. Although held just once during the long years of the Second World War, the competition was revived in 1946 and swiftly became a popular draw for visitors to Blackpool. During the 1950s, its popularity began to go global, with competitors from Japan, Denmark, Germany, Italy and the USA joining British couples as they went head-to-head for the trophy.

"Dozens of Hawaiians have been told to prepare for evacuations as lava flow approaches homes in their sleepy town on Big Island. Officials from Hawaii County Civil Defense say that the leading edge of molten lava is now within about 70 yards of the nearest home in Pahoa Village, and could threaten up to 4,000 residents. The Red Cross has opened a facility in the town, one of the largest in the rural Puna district, to house evacuees fleeing the 2,000-degree molten rock, and a smoke advisory was issued for those downwind of the flow. Scroll down for videos . Red alert: Dozens of residents in the flow path have been told to complete all necessary preparations by Tuesday for a possible evacuation . Gaining speed: A small shed is consumed by lava in a pasture between the Pahoa cemetery and Apa'a Street near the town of Pahoa . Matt Purvis, owner of Tin Shack Bakery in downtown, told CNN that looters were taking the opportunity to steal from abandoned homes. 'Crime is starting to pick up because a lot of people abandoned their houses. Two of my brother-in-laws' houses got ripped off,' Purvis said. The Kilauea volcano has erupted continuously since 1983, but the lava often flows south towards an uninhabited part of the island where it reaches the water. Since June, a flow heading northeast has advanced on Pahoa, and over the past few days was moving at a speed of about 10 to 15 yards an hour, though it slowed to about 2 yards an hour by late Monday. Lava crossed Apaa Street on Sunday as it flowed over a Buddhist cemetery on the edge of the town on its way towards several homes, and officials say it could change direction at any time. Resident Imelda Raras, who lives down the road, said her family is ready to head to another home in the Puna district if she gets the order to leave. 'We are still praying,' she said. 'I hope our home will be spared.' Raras said that she and her husband put their belongings in storage back in September, and anything that couldn't be moved was photographed for insurance purposes. Constant monitoriing: A geologist stands on a partly cooled section of lava flow near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii . Destruction: The growing stream of lava - at a temperature of around 2,000 degrees - has destroyed vegetation and is now threatening homes . Another resident moved out of her home and into her boyfriend's as lava began to threaten her home and said that curious onlookers and road closures had caused traffic jams. 'It's affecting us in every aspect of our lives,' said Warren, an employee at a local surf shop. 'There's just no escaping it.' As the lava rolls in towards the town, it has rapidly heated and decomposed vegetation underneath, creating buildups of methane gas. According to Janet Babb, a spokeswoman for the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, the gas is then ignited, triggering blasts. 'It's not a massive explosion,' she said. 'But it can dislodge rocks. It can hurl large rocks several feet.' If the lava continues flowing northeast, there are fears that it will cut off Pahoa Road, a main artery in the small town. Ticking bomb: Kilauea volcano has been erupting continuously since 1983 and the current flow that has been threatening Pahoa began in June . Heat: This pair of images released by the U.S. Geological Survey compares a shot of the lava flow front (left) with a thermal image showing the approach of the scorching hot molten rock . Smoking: Frequent methane explosions occur, resulting from cooked vegetation releasing methane which then ignites . Additional danger: The explosions caused by trapped methane gas can range from small puffs to loud cannon-like blasts . Aerial shot: This photo shows the front of a lava flow with numerous smoke plumes arising from active breakouts burning vegetation at the flow margin, near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii . Alternative roads have been cut to provide evacuation routes should the lava flow cross the main road. Emergency workers have also encased the bases of power line poles along the path of the volcano in concrete to insulate them from the intense heat. One fear is that the lava flow could reach Highway 130, on the other side of downtown from the volcano. If lava cuts off the bypass there, around 8,000 residents would become 'lava-locked' in Puna. Darryl Oliveira, director of Hawaii County Civil Defense, estimated there around 50 to 60 structures could be impacted, including homes and businesses. He said Monday that the couple occupying the house closest to the lava flow had already left, returning occasionally to move out belongings. 'They are out of the property and awaiting the events to unfold,' Oliveira said. Homeowners are aware of the risks and are required to buy insurance that covers damage caused by volcanic eruptions, as most of the homes in Puna are located on Kilauea itself. Land in Puna is cheaper than more developed parts of the island chain, such as Honolulu on the island of Oahu. There were around 200 homes destroyed by lava flows in the 1990s, while one home was destroyed in 2011 during the last period of evacuations.","Lava flow from the Kilauea volcano has been moving at the rate of about 10 to 15 yards towards Pahoa Village .

"When Louis van Gaal led Holland to a World Cup semi-final playing three at the back and declared he would use the same system at Manchester United it appeared we could be on the cusp of a tactical revolution in this country. Shortly after though Van Gaal, like Harry Redknapp at QPR and a few other managers at clubs in the Football League, had quickly abandoned the back three and returned to systems traditionally more tried and trusted on these shores. One place the back three is still going strong though is not in the aforementioned footballing heartlands of Manchester and London, but down in Bristol. At Ashton Gate, to be precise. Steve Cotterill issues instructions to Korey Smith during Saturday's 1-0 win over Oldham . Louis van Gaal used three at the back with plenty of success at the World Cup with Holland . The opening day of the season saw Sheffield United welcome Bristol City to Bramall Lane. It was supposed to be the confirmation of pre-season predictions that Nigel Clough's Blades would canter to the League One title, but Steve Cotterill hadn't read the script. Cotterill surprised his opposite number with a 3-4-3 system, silencing the home crowd early on by flooding players forward and eventually running out 2-1 winners. Bristol City have not looked back since. Three months on, still employing a system similar to those abandoned by Van Gaal and Redknapp, and Cotterill's side remain unbeaten in League One. Saturday's 1-0 win over Oldham at Ashton Gate was their 10th victory in League One season. If he is being picky, six draws is probably more than Cotterill will have liked, but his side do not lack adventure - they are the top scorers in the division with 33 goals already. Kieran Agard goes head over heels after scoring the Robins' winner at Ashton Gate on Saturday . That's quite some feat when you consider they lost League One's top scorer last season, Sam Baldock, to Brighton in August. The 23 goals lost with Baldock's departure look like they will be more than compensated for by the attacking trio of Kieran Agard, Aaron Wilbraham and Luke Freeman - all signed in the summer. In Cotterill's system, Wilbraham is the target man with the pace of Agard and the guile of Freeman providing further goal threats coming from wide and deep. Between the three of them they have scored 17 in the league already this season. Bristol City have been lucky with injuries so far. Cotterill has had to make very few changes to his starting line-up and with a small squad to choose from he'll need that luck to remain if they are to keep up this relentless form. Cotterill's side are still unbeaten in League One three months and 16 games in to the season . Excluding Baldock, Cotterill has only used 17 players in the league but he does have some nous in reserve to call upon. Defender Adam El-Abd, winger Scott Wagstaff and forward Jay Emmanuel-Thomas have not been regular starters but all have Championship experience. The key will be if those players can slot quickly in to Cotterill's system and one suspects, given how well prepared Bristol City were on that opening day to play three at the back, they might just do so. It is refreshing to see genuine innovation in the lower leagues, and with it a real gamble paying off. The tactical success of Holland and Costa Rica at the World Cup may not have had the impact expected by some on the top flight, but it's influencing things in the third tier. Good week for... HUDDERSFIELD. After failing to win any of his first three games at the club, Chris Powell has masterminded a seven-match unbeaten run. Saturday's 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest leaves the Terriers just six points off the Championship play-off places and, more importantly, eight points clear of the relegation zone. Nahki Wells (second left) celebrates after scoring in Huddersfield's 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest . Bad week for... PRESTON. Having won eight on the spin in League One, Simon Grayson's side headed into Saturday's trip to Rochdale full of confidence. It came as a huge surprise to all, then, when they were seen off rather easily in a 3-0 defeat to dent their automatic promotion hopes. Talent scout: Miles Storey (Portsmouth) A recent Football League column highlighted the number of young talents coming through at Swindon and Storey is another one, albeit it he is out on loan at Portsmouth. The 20-year-old striker, given his debut by Paolo Di Canio in the 2011-12 season, netted in a 3-0 win over Carlisle on Saturday. He is still highly thought of at the County Ground despite being sent out on loan.

"This is the dramatic moment two walkers were forced to cling to each other with a shepherd's crook after getting stranded on a steep slope on a Scottish mountain. The pair had to be rescued by a Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter after getting into difficulty when a path disintegrated beneath them as they climbed Harts Fell, near Moffat in Dumfries and Galloway. A Royal Navy Sea King helicopter, from HMS Gannet at Prestwick, was scrambled to their rescue after they managed to raise the alarm from the  top of the precipitous incline. The two men (above) were forced to cling to each other with a shepherd's crook after getting stuck on a steep slope when the path they were walking along on Harts Fell, near Moffat in Dumfries and Galloway, disintegrated . They were left in a precarious position after getting into difficulty but managed to call for help. A Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter was sent from HMS Gannet at Prestwick and the pair were winched to safety . When the helicopter arrived on scene, one man was found sitting at the top of the steep slope while the other was lying down on the rocky ground below, holding onto his friend's shepherd's crook. He had been clinging to the crook for 45 minutes by the time rescuers arrived at around 11.50am yesterday. The helicopter, which had diverted from a training mission to help the stricken pair, was forced to hover 100ft above the men to avoid dislodging any of the ground while they were winched on board. They were flown to a nearby farm where they were said to be uninjured but 'shaken' by the incident. Lieutenant Commander Jon Green, pilot and duty aircraft commander, said: 'We had to get as near to them as we could, so that we could safely winch our aircrewman down, but, because we knew that they were not only on unstable ground, but that one of them was holding the other by his crook, we had to keep the hover as high as possible to avoid dislodging either the people or the scree with the downwash from the helicopter. 'With the low cloud base, however, this was very difficult. The pair were rescued from Hart Fell, in the Moffat Hills (above), which is 2,651ft high and popular with walkers . 'There was no question of our aircrewman chief petty officer Shaun 'Boogie' Knights detaching from the winch - the conditions underfoot were just too unpredictable. 'So, we had to put ourselves into a steady hover about 100ft directly above them both. 'Boogie went down on the wire and managed to quickly secure a strop around the lower of the two men, before recovering him to the aircraft. 'The same procedure was repeated for his walking partner.' The stranded walkers raised the alarm at 11.05am yesterday and had been returned to safety by 12.20pm. Both were said to be experienced and well-equipped when they started their trek on Hart Fell, which is  2,651ft and a popular climb with hikers.","Two walkers left stranded after path disintegrated on Scottish mountain .

"Usually soldiers on parade are expected to wait for the command to present arms before displaying their weapons. But one female solider in Bicester, Oxfordshire, caused a stir after she was spotted flashing a tattoo of an antique six-shooter pistol on her leg. The body art was photographed during a disbandment parade for 23 Pioneer Regiment after it was broken up as part of MoD plans to cut 20,000 Army jobs. A female soldier from 23 Pioneer Regiment was spotted flashing this tattoo of an antique six-shooter pistol while taking part in a disbandment parade . Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, inspected the troops as they formed up in Bicester, Oxfordshire, today - though apparently didn't notice the unorthodox body-art . The ceremony, which took place this afternoon, was attended by Prince Richard, the Duke of Gloucester. Lynn Pratt, mayor of Bicester, said: 'It is extremely sad to lose such a vital part of our community. The first record of pioneers goes back to 1346, when soldiers bearing the name were recorded on the rolls at Calais. It took until 1854 for the first unit to be formed, called the Army Works Corps, during the Crimean War. This was changed to the Labour Corps during World War One, and then again to the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps, which was shortened to the Pioneer Corps, during World War Two. During that conflict soldiers from the pioneer regiments took part in the D-Day landings, with 23 Pioneer Regiment digging fuel supply lines along the English Channel. King George VI added the distinguished 'Royal' moniker to the Corps' title in 1946, before they became the Royal Logistic Corps in 1993. 'The Regiment has had such a positive impact on the town for many years and the families we have made friends with will be sorely missed. 'We do hope that those who do decide to stay continue to feel an important part of our community. '23 Pioneer will forever remain in our hearts and the dedication of Pioneer Square in our town centre will ensure they remain an important part of the history of Bicester.' The regiment, which is charged with logistical tasks such as digging trenches and repairing defences, has been based at the site since 1941. Troops from 23 Pioneer helped to support soldiers taking part in the D-Day landings during the Second World was, and were also involved in recent conflicts including the Falklands and Bosnia. The Regiment also did tours of the Middle East, including Iraq and Afghanistan, where three soldiers were killed. Its teams helped to search for improvised explosive devices such as roadside bombs, protected convoys, and contributed to construction projects. The Duke of Gloucester inspects 23 Pioneer Regiment shortly before it is disbanded as part of Army plans to cut regular troop numbers by 20,000 . Soldiers hand over two ceremonial axes, the traditional symbol of the pioneers, during the disbandment parade . Lieutenant Colonel David Coulston, the commanding officer, said: 'Bicester has become home to many of my soldiers over the decades and furthermore for some it is the only home they have ever really known. You only have to talk to members of my regiment to realise how true it actually is.' 'We will disband formally in September this year, however we should see the arrival of a new regiment by late 2015. 'I am confident they will receive the same extremely warm welcome that the Pioneers have had over the years. We have been honoured to be associated with Bicester, on behalf of all those I represent, our sincere thank you to you all.' According to the Army's website, small tattoos are allowed as long as they are not offensive, obscene or racist. Small tattoos that aren't offensive in any way are not normally a problem, depending where they are on a soldier's body and how visible they are. The MoD recommends people considering joining the Army who have tattoos should visit their nearest Army careers centre and ask them to check whether it will be OK. The Navy and RAF have a tougher stance on tattoos, requiring them all to be covered up while wearing uniform. If the tattoo is not covered by the clothing then they should be 'concealed cosmetically or by adhesive paper'. Tattoos should be discouraged, RAF guidance says, and those that are 'obscene or offensive', as well markings which are excessive in size or number, are banned. The Navy also ask new recruits to sign a piece of paper which details all tattoos they may have. They must then be revealed during a medical examination.","Female soldier pictured displaying leg tattoo of six-shooter pistol in Oxford .

"A new breast cancer drug from Roche has shown 'unprecedented' benefits in extending lives in a clinical trial. Patients with a type of breast cancer known as HER2 positive, which makes up about a quarter of all breast cancers, who were given Perjeta on top of older medicine Herceptin and chemotherapy lived 15.7 months longer than those on Herceptin and chemotherapy alone. Experts urged its widespread use for women with an aggressive form of the disease. Patients with a type of breast cancer known as HER2 positive, which makes up about a quarter of all breast cancers, who were given Perjeta on top of older medicine Herceptin and chemotherapy lived 15.7 months longer than those on Herceptin and chemotherapy alone. Both Herceptin and Perjeta are antibodies designed to block the function of HER2, a protein produced by a cancer-linked gene. Perjeta, also known as pertuzumab, binds to a different part of the same protein, which makes combining the two drugs extra effective. Perjeta, which was approved by regulators two years ago, was tested in the Roche-backed study involving more than 800 women. Researchers had previously reported the Perjeta drug regimen significantly extended progression-free survival, or the period of time patients live without their disease worsening, but the final overall survival data has taken longer to collect. While both Perjeta and Herceptin have side effects, including rash, diarrhea and a potentially adverse impact on heart function, using the two drugs together did not make these issues any worse. That is the longest extension to survival ever seen for a drug studied in metastatic breast cancer and also an unusually good result for any type of metastatic cancer, where disease has spread to other parts of the body. The result is a vindication of combining medicines that fight tumor cells in a variety of ways. Both Herceptin and Perjeta are antibodies designed to block the function of HER2, a protein produced by a cancer-linked gene. Perjeta, also known as pertuzumab, binds to a different part of the same protein, which makes combining the two drugs extra effective. 'The results, I think, are phenomenal,' lead researcher Sandra Swain from the Washington Hospital Center told the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual congress in Madrid on Sunday. 'The survival improvement of nearly 16 months ... is unprecedented among studies of metastatic breast cancer.' Perjeta, which was approved by regulators two years ago, was tested in the Roche-backed study involving more than 800 women. Researchers had previously reported the Perjeta drug regimen significantly extended progression-free survival, or the period of time patients live without their disease worsening, but the final overall survival data has taken longer to collect. The median overall survival time was 56.5 months for those given Perjeta against the already impressive 40.8 months for patients taking only the older drugs. Looking at the study results a different way, the risk of dying was reduced by 32 percent for women who received the Perjeta regimen compared to those who got Herceptin and chemotherapy. While both Perjeta and Herceptin have side effects, including rash, diarrhea and a potentially adverse impact on heart function, using the two drugs together did not make these issues any worse. 'I think these data are really compelling,' said Eric Van Cutsem of the University of Leuven, who was not involved in the research. 'When you see in breast cancer such a big change in survival with not a lot of cardio-toxicities then that is really practice-changing.' Swain and Javier Cortes, another researcher on the study from the Vall D'Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, said the results suggested using Perjeta should now be the standard of care for HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Both Herceptin and Perjeta are antibodies designed to block the function of HER2, a protein produced by a cancer-linked gene. Perjeta, also known as pertuzumab, binds to a different part of the same protein, which makes combining the two drugs extra effective. A favorable reaction from oncologists will underpin expectations of strong sales for Perjeta, which analysts currently expect to sell $3.1 billion a year by 2018, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis. But it poses a challenge for healthcare providers, since Perjeta and Herceptin are costly injectable drugs and the multiple-drug regimen promises to strain budgets. In the United States, the monthly price of Perjeta is approximately $5,900, while Herceptin costs around $5,300, a Roche spokeswoman said. Prices in Europe are lower. For Roche, Perjeta is an important new product that should help defend its position in breast cancer, following the success of Herceptin, which was first approved in 1998. The company said the latest data would be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world for inclusion in the prescribing information for Perjeta. The Swiss drugmaker also has another related drug called Kadcyla, which is also being tested in combination with Perjeta. Some analysts believe Kadcyla's prospects could be curbed if results from that combination are not better than the impressive findings reported this weekend.","Trial on patients with a type of breast cancer known as HER2 positive, which makes up about a quarter of all breast cancers .

"Dead: Cassidy Charette, 17, of Oakland died overnight of injuries sustained during a Harvest Hill Farms hay ride in Mechanic Falls, Maine . A teenage girl has died and 22 others are hurt after a Jeep pulling a trailer with more than 20 passengers careened down a hill in a Maine forest hitting a tree and flipping over, authorities say. Cassidy Charette, 17, of Oakland died overnight of injuries sustained during a Harvest Hill Farms hay ride in Mechanic Falls, Maine, according to Maine State Public Safety spokesperson Steve McCausland. Bangor Daily News reports that Charette and seven other students from Messalonskee High School in Oakland were on the hayride at the time of the crash, including 16-year-old Connor Garland, of Belgrade, who is listed in critical condition at Boston Children’s Hospital. Both Garland and the Jeep's driver, David Brown, 54, of South Paris, are in critical condition. 'It was just kids out on a Saturday night hayride,' McCausland told BDN. McCausland told the Portland Press Herald that 15 of the injured were taken to Central Maine Medical Center, seven were taken to St. Mary's Regional Medical Center (both in Lewiston), one person was taken to the Maine Medical Center in Portland for treatment, and two people were transported to hospitals by LifeFlight. The victims were travelling on The Gauntlet Haunted Night Ride trailer at Pumpkin Land in Mechanic Falls when the vehicle overturned. All of the victims are reportedly aged 15 or older. The accident occurred at around 8.30pm Saturday at the top of a hill at Harvest Hill Farms, situated on Route 26, around 30 miles north of Portland, according to the PPH. During the ride, which includes 'things that jump and scream in the night,' the driver of a jeep pulling the trailer missed a right-hand turn, said Androscoggin County Sheriff, Guy Desjardins. Critical: Sixteen-year-old Connor Garland, of Belgrade,  and the Jeep's driver, David Brown, 54, of South Paris, are in critical condition . The vehicle then flipped over, injuring everyone on board including the driver. 'The trailer jackknifed and the jeep went off the road,' Desjardins told the PPH, describing the woodland hill as 'very steep'. 'We're talking about a very narrow dirt road, but extremely steep,' he said. He added: 'I’ve never witnessed a single incident that resulted in so many injuries.' Following the incident, seven fire crews and three police departments - including state police - rushed to the scene, David Clukey, of the Mechanic Falls Fire Department, told CNN. Crash: A 17-year-old girl has died and two others are in critical condition after a  hayride trailer that was carrying them flipped over in a forest in Maine. Above, authorities are pictured at the scene in Mechanic  Falls Saturday night . Jennifer Johnson, a nursing supervisor at St. Mary's in Lewiston, said the hospital had received seven patients from the incident, all of whom were 'stable'. WCSH 6 reports that investigators believe the cause of the accident may have been a mechanical problem with the Jeep. Authorities will inspect the Jeep as part of an investigation into the cause of the accident. Hospital: Two people were airlifted to hospital following the crash, while the 21 others - including the driver - were taken by ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston and St. Mary's Regional Medical Center in Lewiston; one was taken to the Maine Medical Center in Portland .

"A dad who said he repeatedly bounced his 10-week-old baby on a blow-up mattress before squeezing the breath out of him in a 'bear hug', has been found guilty of first degree murder. Anthony Casanova, 41, showed no change of expression as he was convicted of killing his baby son Tyler at their home in Norton Shores, Michigan, in January 2013. The father had originally claimed that he had crushed the baby when he tripped over his miniature dachshund, causing him to fall on the child. Scroll down for video . Anthony Casanova (left) is met by his attorney Fred Johnson after being taken into custody after being convicted of first degree murder of his 10-week-old son Tyler . But during a long police interview, Casanova said he had 'bounced' the crying baby seven or eight times on an inflated air mattress and squeezed him twice in a 'bear hug'. Casanova's mother, Darlene Thomas, who testified in his defense earlier in the day, wept in the audience as the verdict was read out, Mlive reported. According to the paper, Muskegon County Prosecutor D.J. Hilson said: 'We're pleased, obviously, that Tyler got the justice that he so deserved, and I look forward to his killer being sentenced for the rest of his life in prison.' In Michigan, the mandatory sentence is life in prison without chance of parole for first-degree murder. Earlier that day, Casanova wept as his mother told the jury that her son was a kind man and a doting father who was good with small children. Casanova wept as his mother told the jury that her son was a kind man and a doting father who was good with small children . She explained that he was prone to be a 'people pleaser' who will tell people what they want to hear when he's under pressure. Combined with her son's learning disabilities - including attention deficit disorder and reading problems - Ms Thomas said this made him prone to tell people what they want to hear when he's under pressure, even if it is a false confession. She said her son had been told he could not have biological children and was overjoyed when he learned his girlfriend, Julia Striker, was pregnant with Tyler. Ms Thomas also said Casanova and his ex-wife adopted twin special-needs children who were two when Tyler died. Thomas lives in a different state to her son and said she had not seen Casanova after Tyler was born. But she added that Casanova constantly texted her photographs of Tyler and his adopted children. Casanova  wiped his eyes repeatedly as his mother testified and sobbed openly at points. Dr Joyce deJong, Muskegon County medical examiner, also spoke yesterday morning, giving testimony for the prosecution about her examination and autopsy of Tyler on January 5, 2013, the day after he died. She described extensive injuries, including a skull fracture, bleeding between the skull and the brain, and bruises on Tyler's chin, chest and abdomen. Some of the injuries partially healed, she said. Dr de Jong said the 25 bruises on the 10-week-old's body were the size of fingertips. She said Tyler also had partially healed fractured ribs, a lacerated liver, bleeding inside his spleen and a bruised heart. Tyler, aged just 10-weeks, was killed by his father at their home in Norton Shores, Michigan . She said that, given the examination and autopsy, her medical conclusion was that the baby's death was a homicide caused by 'multiple injuries intentionally inflicted by another'. She said the injuries were not consistent with Casanova's original story of accidentally falling on the baby and crushing him. The doctor said that even if the older, healing injuries were disregarded,  the fatal head injury alone was not consistent with being crushed by another object. This is because bleeding inside the skull, she explained, caused by tearing of tiny blood vessels, is consistent only with a 'motion injury,' with the baby striking another object while moving. Casanova's mother, Darlene Thomas, who testified in her son's defense earlier in the day . She also said the bruises on Tyler's body were not consistent with a panicked, untrained person trying to revive a baby using CPR. Casanova had claimed he was holding Tyler in one arm and letting his dog in through a glass door, when the pet ran between his legs, tripping him and causing him to drop the baby on the carpet and then fall on top of him. Former Norton Shores Police Department Detective Anthony Nanna testifies during the trial . In court, the Norton Shores fire chief, a police officer, a police sergeant and a paramedic all testified that Casanova told them the same story about tripping and falling on the baby. The only difference between the stories was that, while he told most he dropped the 10-week-old and then fell on him, the fire chief remembers Casanova saying the two fell together. On Wednesday, jurors watched and heard a video and audio recording of Casanova's interview with Detective Tony Nanna. The interview just a few hours after Tyler died. According to Mlive, the jury heard persistent persuasion by Nanna, who repeatedly insisted that the dog story wasn't believable, suggesting that an exhausted Casanova had 'snapped'. He initially said: 'I honestly can't remember what happened,' adding 'nothing was done intentionally' when Nanna suggested he had shaken the baby. A few minutes later, Casanova added: 'I need help. With my anger and my mood swings... and I feel like I have a split personality,' though still insisting the injuries were an 'accident'. Casanova went on to say he 'bounced' Tyler seven or eight times on an inflated air mattress. Later, as he was being handcuffed in preparation for being arrested and taken to jail, Casanova said he had 'squeezed' the 10-week-old twice until Tyler 'lost his breath,' but with the baby resuming breathing both times. Julia Striker, mother of 10-week-old Tyler Casanova, testifies during Anthony Casanova's murder trial . Defendant Anthony Casanova stands alongside his attorney Fred Johnson during his murder trial . The defense team, led by Muskegon County Public Defender Fred Johnson insisted that the dog story was true in their opening statement and that Casanova told detectives he had shaken the baby so that he could return home to his fiancee. But, according to Mlive, in his closing argument yesterday, Mr Johnson did not mention the dog story at all. Casanova said he accidentally fell on his 10-week-old son when his miniature dachshund tripped him . Instead, he appeared to be arguing for a compromise verdict - a conviction not of first-degree felony murder, but something less, such as manslaughter or second-degree murder. He focused on intent, noting that multiple witnesses testified Casanova loved his children and was good with them. 'The step was made over the line. ... But it wasn't intentional,' Johnson said. 'What father intends to kill his child?' Tyler's maternal grandmother, Joyce Wagner, the defendant's younger brother Mark Thomas and a day-care provider, Robin Carpenter, all testified they saw nothing abnormal about Tyler when they saw him days before his death. In his closing arguments, Mr Johnson acknowledged the damage done to the defense by a video of Casanova's interview with a police detective in which he changed his story. 'That was devastating for the defense,' he. 'You heard it, you saw it... And then you heard the medical examiner this morning, and that too was devastating for the defense. I'm not going to try to pull you away from that.' But Mr Hilson, prosecuting, insisted that this was not a manslaughter case . 'You don't get to kill your kid and say you lost it, he told the jury. 'No way. No way. This man intentionally inflicted these injuries on a defenseless 2-month-old child,' 'Don't compromise. Find him guilty of felony murder.' The jury took just 45 minutes to decide on a verdict. Sentencing is scheduled for October 27. Anthony Casanova enters the courtroom prior to the jury selection process on the first day of his trial .

"Police have vowed to spend another two years tracking down the rioters and looters who ransacked England's streets. Those who thought they had escaped the law by now should not rest easy as police have pledged to trawl through 40,0000 hours of CCTV footage in a bid to bring every single person involved to justice. Officers have promised to pursue each offender they can identify, The Times reported. Police are determined to track down every single suspect, and have resorted to using big screens, like this one outside the Bull Ring in Birmingham, as part of their investigation . But it is anticipated that some of the more difficult cases will take years to complete. Scotland Yard say that so far 2,006 people have been arrested in connection with the rioting and looting. Of those 1,135 have been charged, with 954 of those cases appearing before a court, 82 have been sentenced and 42 have been jailed. But the investigation is far from over, as police are determined to use every scrap of evidence they can find from CCTV, which has been heavily criticised as being unnecessarily intrusive and imposing a 'Big Brother' watch on society. Police are seizing the opportunity to showcase just how effective the surveillance cameras can be in helping to combat crime. Already they have set up dedicated websites filled with CCTV images of suspects' images, using social media websites including Twitter to encourage people to view the pictures and 'shop a looter'. Police are not daunted by the hours of CCTV they will have to trawl through, or suspects' attempts to disguise themselves, as they vow to hunt down every rioter and looter . They have broadcast CCTV images and video on huge billboards and used vans with screens attached to publish footage. Police say their campaign to catch those involved has been overwhelmed by members of the public who have eagerly come forward to inform them of suspects. The Times reported dedicated officers are ploughing through 10,000 hours of CCTV material while cameras in the Bull Ring shopping centre in Birmingham have 743 hours of material. Detective Chief Inspector Steven Reed, of West Midlands Police, told the newspaper they would not rest until they had searched every avenue to identify offenders. And Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Concannon, from the Met's riot investigation, Operation Withern, told the newspaper harnessing the power of CCTV was crucial. 'There is a wider debate about CCTV but in this investigation it is absolutely core, it's critical. 'We're looking at footage where people have made little or no effort to disguise their faces. 'Sometimes they pulled up a scarf or a hood just before they go into a looted shop, then 50 metres down the road they take it off again, or they'll get into a car with the registration number clearly visible.' Crackdown: Armed Pelle, left, and Anderson Fernandes, right, have already been tracked down and jailed. Pelle was punished for inciting violence on Facebook, while Anderson was imprisoned for taking a lick of  stolen ice cream . Already the police have shown just how determined they are to track all of the rioters and looters down. A teenager who used Facebook to encourage the 'killing of a million police officers' during the riots has been jailed for 33 months. Amed Pelle incited his 2,000 friends on the site to commit violence and looting in Nottingham. He asked if any of them 'wanted anything' from a fashion store that was later targeted. The jobless 18-year-old posted three messages on his Facebook 'wall' on August 9, hours before serious disorder broke out in his home city. The first two read 'Nottz Riot whose onit?' and 'Kill one black youth, we kill a million Fedz (police), riot til we own cities'. It is believed the second message was a reference to Mark Duggan, whose death in Tottenham sparked the original trouble. In his third message, Pelle wrote: 'Rioting 2nyt anyone want anything from (fashion chain) Flannels?' The store, in Nottingham city centre, had its windows smashed hours later. Pelle had pleaded guilty to a breach of section 44 of the Serious Crime Act 2007, doing an act which was capable of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence, namely violent disorder. Judge John Milmo told Pelle that his comments 'encouraged attacks on the people of Nottingham as a whole, and the people of other cities.' Upmarket shop: Fernandes walked into this Patisserie Valerie in Manchester and helped himself to a cone and two scoops of ice cream . Sentencing the teenager to two years and nine months in a young offenders' institution, he added: 'Your offence was designed to, and could well have led to, increased numbers on the street intent on violence to persons and property. 'An element of deterrence is called for in cases like this. A clear signal needs to be sent out that criminal conduct of the kind demonstrated in these cases is out of order and will not be brushed under the carpet.' His sentence came as a looter who took just one lick of an ice cream he stole during rioting before he gave it away was jailed for 16 months. Anderson Fernandes, 21, wandered into an upmarket store in central Manchester after the door was left open and helped himself to a cone and two scoops. But despite giving it to a passer-by because he didn't like the coffee flavour he was still given a lengthy prison term. The sentence will fuel fears that courts are meting out disproportionate justice to those caught up in the disorder. Yesterday Manchester Crown Court was told that ice cream thief Fernandes, 21, was arrested after raiding Patisserie Valerie because he left DNA behind at the scene. He admitted burglary and an unconnected charge of handling a stolen vacuum cleaner after his arrest. The court heard that Fernandes had already appeared in court charged with possessing drugs and an offensive weapon on the same day he got mixed up in the disorder. Michael McQuillan, defending, said: 'He is remorseful and fully accepts how serious the matter was and why courts take such a serious view of this type of behaviour.'","Metropolitan police have 40,000 hours worth of CCTV to trawl through .

"Many of the women signing up for ultra marathons and marathons today will take for granted their right to compete. But only 40 years ago, it was not an option. As recently as the Eighties, it was thought to be too dangerous for women to run long distances. It wasn't until the late Seventies that big city marathons began to allow women to compete. And women were not allowed to take part in the marathon at the Olympics until 1984. Since then, women's participation in marathons, ultra marathons, and adventure races has flourished. Not just for macho men: A quarter of the Men's Health Survival Of The Fittest entrants are now female . One race series involving a tough army-style assault course is attracting an increasing number of female participants despite being sponsored by a men's magazine. The Men's Health Survival Of The Fittest series is not just about males proving their strength and stamina as now a quarter of the 18,500 entrants are women. The race, held in cities across the UK, involves running at least 10k over an urban assault course where challenges including swinging across monkey bars, scaling high walls and scrambling through mud under a net. Jim Mee, founder of Rat Race Adventure Sports, who organises the Men's Health Survival Of The Fittest races and other endurance events, said: 'Over the past two years we have seen a significant increase in women taking part in our events. 'There could be several reasons for this increase, but in my opinion I believe that a lot of women are using endurance races and events as a target to help motivate them to lose weight, or improve their fitness.' One of the women who has decided to take part in the obstacle course race for the first time this year is Lesley McDonald, 35, who lives in Glasgow. No walk in the park: The obstacle course races involve scaling walls and crawling under nets through the mud . She told MailOnline: 'I have signed up for it as part of a series of challenges I have committed to doing for a year to raise money for charity whilst also getting fit. 'I wanted a wide range of challenges, rather than just running straightforward 10Ks. I also wanted to do events where you could enter as a team, so I am doing this with a group of former colleagues.' Despite the masculine name of the series, Lesley said she wasn't put off entering the Men's Health event in Manchester this November. She said: 'It has never crossed my mind that these events would be male dominated. It's great to see more women getting involved.' Meanwhile, another of Rat Race Adventure Sports events - The Wall Ultra - is also appealling to more women. At this year's race, which follows an off-road route along Hadrian's Wall, 40 per cent of the entrants were female. Up for the challenge: Lesley McDonald, 35, left, is training for a Men's Health Survival Of The Fittest event, while Sally Ford, 37,  finished The Wall Ultra Marathon . Sally Ford, 37, from Hutton Roof, in Cumbria, was the first woman to finish the 69 mile run in 2014. She said: 'I've met lots of ultra runners/adventure racers in the last few years and I think the women are definitely tougher than the men! Once we put our minds to something we usually follow it through to the end, no matter how hard it gets. 'We're used to juggling jobs, kids, hobbies and home life. It's often a struggle to fit everything in but I think that's what makes us more determined to finish these races. Dropping out isn't an option.' The women taking part in such long distance events have some inspiring role models in ultra distance runners like Lizzy Hawker and Ellie Greenwood. Lizzy, 37, from London, has won The North Face Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc five times and in 2013 set a new world record running from Everest Base Camp to Kathmandu in Nepal. Meanwhile, Ellie, 35, became the first British woman to win the Comrades Ultra Marathon - an undulating 55 mile race - this year. They have proved that women can run for as long as men - and often at a faster pace than them as well. Pioneer: Kathrine Switzer campaigned for women to be able to run marathons and was the first to complete the Boston Marathon, despite race officials physically trying to stop her . Kathrine Switzer was one of the women who campaigned for the right for women to compete in the marathon. She became a figurehead for the cause after she took part in the Boston Marathon in 1967 - and organisers physically tried to remove her from the race when they realised she was a woman. Kathrine, now 67, said of her desire to take part: 'I was just a kid who wanted to run, and was there as a reward from my coach who didn't believe that a woman could run the distance. 'I had heard that other women had run marathon distances and that one woman in 1966 ran the Boston Marathon but without a bib number, so I wasn't trying to break any barriers. It wasn't until a race official attacked me during the run did I become determined to finish and speak out on behalf of all women.' She did finish and went on to run many more marathons - as well as helping other women have the right to do the same. She said joining the successful campaign to make the women's marathon an Olympic event by 1984 was her biggest 'life victory'. She said: 'I knew when the world saw women in the most difficult of all running events, competing in the most important and prestigious sports event the Olympics it would change world attitudes about women's capability. Everyone everywhere understands that 26.2 miles (or 42.2 km,) is a long way to run, and when they see women doing it they know that women can do anything and should be allowed to participate.' Ten years ago, just 13 people set off together on a timed 5k run around their local park in London. This weekend thousands around the world will do the same thing thanks to the growth of the parkrun organisation. Founded by Paul Sinton-Hewitt, who has been awarded a CBE for services to grassroots sport, parkruns are held across the UK and in other parts of the world every Saturday at 9am. The ethos is it's a 'timed run' not a race - so everyone is welcome regardless of their fitness or competitiveness. Children can take part (and in some areas there are 3k junior parkruns), as can parents with pushchairs and dogs with their owners. All the runs are free and require no pre-entry. All people have to do is sign up once on the parkrun website and print off a personal barcode to take along on any Saturday they want to take part (the barcode is how you get your time after the run). For many people, their local parkrun has become part of their fitness routine or started them on a journey to become a marathoner or ultra marathoner. For others, it's just a free, fun way to stay healthy -so it's no wonder ten years later, 13 has become 850,000 from Olympians to absolute beginners. Happy birthday parkrun!","Quarter of Men's Health Survival Of The Fittest entrants are female .

"Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs announced his decision to retire from playing on Monday - click here to read his open letter to supporters . Manchester United have appointed Louis van Gaal as their new manager following the sacking of David Moyes last month - immediately endearing himself to the club's support by vowing to 'make history'.

"A former White House and Pentagon official unhappy with the way the United States has been embracing equality and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has proposed sectioning off some states and creating a new country. Douglas MacKinnon, who served as a writer for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, believes the more conservative southern states should secede from the nation to form a new republic that is 'dedicated to traditional values'. The name for this country would be Reagan, MacKinnon proposed . 'If you happen to make a donation in favor of traditional marriage, you can lose your job,' the right-wing columnist said in an interview with right-wing radio host Janet Mefferd, according to Salon.

MacKinnon, a controversial political columnist who has contributed to newspapers all over the country, is currently promoting his new book, The Secessionist States of America: The Blueprint for Creating a Traditional Values County ...

'And the consensus was that the three best states in the union would be South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.' Mackinnon said Texas did not make the cut because its influx of Mexican immigrants makes it less traditionalist than the other states. 'The interim name for the country, by the way, is Reagan,' he added in the interview. According to The Huffington Post, Mackinson faced major backlash earlier this year a ""pro-gay agenda"" and was engaged in an effort to ""indoctrinate"" children.

"Ched Evans maintained his claims of ‘absolute innocence’ of rape yesterday hours after his pre-dawn release from jail. A statement on a website set up to clear the footballer’s name insisted again he had been a victim of a ‘gross miscarriage of justice’. And his family said they were confident an application to the Criminal Cases Review Committee for a second appeal would succeed. Scroll down for video . Ched Evans was whisked out of prison today as a statement maintaining his 'absolute innocence' appeared on a website campaigning for his conviction to be overturned . Evans jumped into the back of a blacked-out Mercedes 4x4. A witness described it as a 'synchronised movement' saying that it must have been prearranged . ‘We believe that due to Ched’s profession, information that was not used by his original defence and other information that has been gathered since his conviction will in time over turn a wrongful conviction,’ they said. The 25-year-old was bundled into a blacked-out Mercedes 4x4 shortly before 5am outside the jail where he had been held with fellow sex offenders such as TV presenter Stuart Hall. In a carefully-staged manoeuvre, the silver Mercedes reversed at speed toward the gates of Wymott prison near Leyland in Lancashire. The footballer’s family ordered a bouncy castle for a party to celebrate his release from prison yesterday. The giant inflatable was spotted outside his mother’s house in Ryhl, North Wales. But the attention it drew from press photographers appeared to make the family change their minds before it was blown up. The two deliverymen were told to take it away again by a woman who emerged from the house to say: ‘I’m sorry but I think we’d better cancel it.’ It was not clear yesterday whether Evans was to be a guest at the party. Evans, who had served half his sentence, emerged from a side gate and was immediately bundled into the waiting vehicle. ‘It was a synchronised movement,’ an onlooker said. ‘They must have organised it on the phone as it was all so quick. Ched dived in the back and the car sped off.’ Evans was jailed for five years in 2012 after being convicted of raping a drunken 19-year-old after a former team-mate invited her back to a hotel room in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales. He admitted having sex with her, but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident. A steady stream of well-wishers called at his family home ahead of an expected celebration, with relatives having flown in from all over the world for the reunion. His family lashed out over media coverage of the case as well as at rape campaigners who criticised Judy Finnigan for saying Evans should be allowed to return to his old club, Sheffield United. Yesterday his mother, Helen Roberts, 51, who earlier in the week took to Twitter to back Miss Finnigan, continued to hit out at her son’s critics. Shortly before he regained his freedom, she posted: ‘Thank you to every single person that has supported, took abuse and argued for Ched and my family it really has helped keep us strong.’ Evans' campaign website is being funded by the millionaire father of his girlfriend Natasha Massey (right), who is standing by him despite his conviction . The organiser of a petition calling on Sheffield United not to re-sign Evans last night revealed she had suffered online abuse – including being threatened with an acid bath. The feminist campaigner, who uses the pseudonym Jean Hatchet, had been criticised by Evans’s family for setting up what they described in a statement as an ‘anonymous spammed petition’. Yesterday Labour sports spokesman Clive Efford said it was not appropriate for Evans to return to professional football at all after his release. ‘There are many areas of employment where, when you’ve committed a crime like that, you are not allowed to be employed in that form of employment, and I think football is one of them, because you are a role model within a community,’ he told the BBC.","Statement posted online today called conviction 'miscarriage of justice'

"You might know her as the glossy haired ‘It’ girl with a bona fide aristocratic background, a woman regularly linked with the rich and eligible including, for a time, Prince Andrew and footballer Ryan Giggs. Or perhaps you have seen her as the glamorous socialite-turned-entrepreneur on the gloriously lightweight Ladies of London, a reality TV show that revels in the tribulations and jealousies of the capital’s ‘elite’ lunchers. But Caroline Stanbury has another, altogether different claim to fame, one which is guaranteed to set jaws dropping to the parquet – even in the super-rich Surrey commuter belt where she has her £8million home. Scroll down for video . Caroline Stanbury, pictured with 16 of her designer handbags from collection, at her £8million home in Surrey . 1) Two Celine mini luggage totes: New 'It' bag . 2) Two Hermes Birkin 40cm: A Hermes classic . 3) Chanel small classic flap: Popular for decades . 4) Chanel Boy: Unique take on a classic design . 5) Hermes Lindy: Functional, but chic . 6) Celine luggage tote: Bag that carries it all . 7) Hermes Constance: Perfect shoulder bag . 8) Nancy Gonzalez crocodile tote: Playful pink . For at the heart of her mini-mansion is a very special room, virtually a shrine. And it is dedicated to a quite outrageous collection of handbags so expensive that just one of them would keep the average household running for several months. ‘All my friends think my collection of designer handbags is ridiculous,’ Caroline admits. ‘Cem, my husband, thinks I’m crazy to have so many.’ He has little chance of avoiding them. Taking pride of place in their imposing hallway stands a sculpture that pays homage to her near obsession: a cast-iron statue in the shape of that most desirable of female possessions, a Hermes Birkin bag, a monument to a thoroughly modern collection. Housed in a custom-made walk-in wardrobe with full-length mirrors, velvet-lined window seats, Venetian glass dressers and cashmere-soft cream carpets, are at least 25 bags by Hermes and Chanel. Caroline is understandably shy of pricing the collection, but it is not unreasonable to guess they are worth a cool £200,000; the basic cost of a Birkin is £5,000. She even has two Hermes Kelly 28cm bags, which could cost anything up to £25,000. But the price of this and other luxury bags can rapidly reach the stratosphere depending on size, on the materials used and if there are any customised alterations. The bags visible here are not the whole of her collection – even at a conservative estimate they are worth nearly £85,000. Every item is organised by colour and designer, including regular and clutch-sized Birken and Kelly bags in pink, burnt orange, tan and jade green. ‘I’ve arranged my collection very carefully and I prefer no one touches them, but I am not overly precious,’ she says. ‘My bags get well-used, but not always well-treated.’ Sixteen more shelves groan with literally hundreds of shoes by Tom Ford, Gianvito Rossi (‘the most comfortable shoes you will ever wear’), Chanel, Givenchy and Valentino (so chic, apparently.) There are stilettos, sling backs and pumps in every colour and style imaginable – an array worth £100,000 – all glittering beneath spotlights. ‘I must have 200 pairs of shoes, which I don’t think is that many,’ she says. ‘I don’t buy from the High Street, because I want things to last.’ But her true weakness, the former stylist and party girl admits, is those handbags. It has been a long association: she was given her first Birken when I was 21. Caroline pictured at Arts for Human Rights Foundation dinner also has 200 pairs of shoes . ‘Look,’ she says, ‘I’ve worked hard all my life to fund this lifestyle. I used to buy the “It” bags and I would live on baked beans for weeks to afford them. But I got fed up because everyone had the same thing. Now I buy classic bags. I am a very good customer at Hermes and they know me personally. ‘For all that my husband moans, he actually feeds my habit. We have just got back from Venice and he bought me the new Chanel Boy bag in cream.’ She picks it up and hugs it to her chest. ‘If you don’t have money to spend on clothes, a beautiful handbag makes the rest of your outfit look expensive. I especially love going to Paris because when you are in a nice restaurant you are always given an extra chair for the Birken which makes me laugh.’ The Birkin is her outright favourite, so much so that she owns 15 of them. ‘Although actually I might just be over my Birken addiction,’ she says. ‘Now it’s all about the Constance, which is smaller, lighter and can be worn over the shoulder.’ Estimated to be worth £20million in her own right, Caroline is at pains to say she is also a grafter. Today she runs two successful businesses, Giftlibrary.com, an online gift service, and The Wedding Shop of Caroline Stanbury, a one-stop wedding shop. ‘I actually live a stressful life,’ she insists. ‘I know it may not seem that way from the show but running two businesses is tough.’ Her entrance into ‘society’ however was pretty much pain-free. As a 17-year-old at the Berkeley Dress Show, then the curtain raiser to the London season, she went down the catwalk with her mother Elizabeth, a descendant of the Vestey dynasty. Since then, she has led a charmed and well-connected existence. Caroline is still remembered for what was widely assumed to be a relationship with Prince Andrew – but she wants to put the record straight, saying they were nothing more than friends. ‘The truth is we have known each other for many years – he knows my parents and used to read stories to my brother and sister, but we have only ever been friends Nothing went on between us so it was awkward when we were wrong-ly linked in the press.’ There was another notable liaison, too. ‘I met Ryan Giggs at the Monte Carlo sports awards when I was 24,’ she explains. ‘He was a big star at the time with Manchester United. But he wasn’t a huge party boy, he was quite shy. ‘It was a strange relationship because he was always travelling so we spent most of it on the phone. He certainly wasn’t the love of my life.’ She ended the relationship when she read in a newspaper that Giggs had cheated on her. ‘Frankly, he did me a favour,’ she says. ‘If I had stayed with Ryan there is no way I would be where I am now.’ She is now married to the Turkish financier Cem Habib, with whom she has three children; daughter Yasmine, eight, and four-year-old twin sons, Zack and Aaron. The couple met in 2003 and have been married for ten years. Caroline with her American co-star and supermodel Caprice Bourret on set of reality show Ladies of London . Perhaps it should be expected that Caroline, now 38, was top of TV producers’ wish list for Ladies of London, which follows the lives of two wealthy British women and five fame-hungry Americans. ‘They wanted an aristocrat on the show as a contrast to the Americans,’ she says. ‘And it was interesting for them to see someone from my background who actually works for a living. ‘Episode one was the most difficult. I cringed when I watched it on television.’ She may not have been the only one. ‘Mum was terrified about me doing Ladies of London but I thought that reality television is a quick way to get recognition. ‘I have always wanted to be successful. If Cem was the richest man on the planet I would still work. I know that anything can happen. My dad (capitalist Anthony Stanbury) made and lost money. I’ll always work to afford our lifestyle. ‘But when I started I knew little about business. I still have a copy of Business School for Dummies on my desk. People think things came easy for me, that I was handed everything on a plate. I haven’t been. I’ve been to Hell and back with Giftlibrary.com. I’ve weathered a double dip recession.’ Her success on the television show seems to have genuinely surprised Stanbury. ‘I really didn’t expect it. At school I was never the most popular girl. I was really ugly and used to get picked on.’ Although with a collection of bags like that, she won’t get much sympathy now... Solved: Prince Andrew and the mystery blonde (right), who turned out to be TV presenter Annabelle Bond . Caroline has often been linked with Prince Andrew, but she insists it is a case of mistaken identity. In 2000 he was photographed at a St Tropez beach with a blonde and a media frenzy ensued, identifying her as the mystery woman. ‘Though I was named as the girl in the picture, it wasn’t me,’ Caroline laughs. ‘It was Annabelle Bond [the TV presenter and explorer]. ‘But even my mother thought that it was me at first!’ Annabelle Bond, the TV presenter, was later revealed to be the mystery woman with Prince Andrew .","Caroline Stanbury has special room in her £8million home for her handbags .

"The mother of a 17-year-old boy was charged Wednesday with allowing him to take a loaded handgun to school. Leah Wilcken, 41, faces four misdemeanor counts, each carrying a potential penalty of a year in jail and a $1,000 fine, the city attorney's office said. 'Guns have no place in or around our schools,' City Attorney Mike Feuer said. 'Our office will continue to take aggressive action to protect our kids.  And I call on parents to prevent potentially devastating consequences by safely storing every firearm they own.' The LA City attourney filed criminal charges against a woman whose 17-year-old son allegedly took a loaded semiautomatic handgun to Van Nuys school . Wilcken couldn't immediately be reached for comment, and it wasn't immediately clear whether she had an attorney. Prosecutors said that in May, the woman's 17-year-old son brought a loaded .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun and a spare magazine containing seven bullets to Will Rogers High School in Van Nuys. 'He was in a dispute with another student and had made posting on social media' calling on the student to meet him in the school parking lot, city attorney's spokesman Frank Mateljan said. A student who had seen the gun earlier in the day notified the principal, and school police found the gun and ammunition in the boy's backpack in the parking lot, Mateljan said. The charges stem from an incident on May 13, 2014, when the 17-year-old boy allegedly brought a fully loaded .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, with an additional fully loaded seven-round magazine to the school . 'The officers believed that the gun may have come from home,' but when they called his mother she refused to cooperate with the investigation, he said. The next day, Los Angeles police went to the home and found four other handguns and a shotgun, including a gun that was found in a kitchen cabinet, authorities said. Wilcken was charged with allowing a child to carry a firearm off-premises; allowing a child to take a firearm to school; contributing to the delinquency of a minor; and permitting a child to be placed in a situation where their person or health is endangered. It is the first time that the city has filed charges against the parent of a child who took a gun to school, Feuer said. However, a San Diego County man was arrested in May after his 14-year-old son took the father's loaded .44-caliber revolver to a Chula Vista high school in a backpack. Zachariah Dow later pleaded guilty to child abuse and being a felon in possession of a gun and ammunition. Feuer also said that the group Women Against Gun Violence has a program to educate parents about their responsibilities for safely storing guns. Working with school districts, the group provides information about locking up weapons and talking to children about guns.","Leah Wilcken, 41, was charged with allowing a child to take a firearm off-premises, allowing the child to take the gun to school, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and allowing a child to be endangered .

"Last week Neil Lennon took the biggest gamble of his footballing career. After talks with chief executive Peter Lawwell he made the decision to bring a tempestuous four year reign as manager of Celtic to an end. Following further discussions with major shareholder Dermot Desmond at the beginning of this week the matter is settled. As Sportsmail first revealed on Thursday Lennon’s tenure as Parkhead manager is now over. To many his departure will come as no great surprise. That he appears to be leaving without a job to go to most certainly is. Taking a risk: Neil Lennon's decision to leave Celtic without a club to join is a gamble . No surprise: Lennon's departure from Celtic Park didn't come as a shock . Linked for weeks with Norwich City the Carrow Road hotseat is now Malky Mackay’ s to turn down. Brighton and West Brom are also in the market for a manager, but so far Lennon has barely rated a mention for either. Quitting a huge and relatively secure job, then, is a hell of a step. For some time it was speculated he might leave. On messageboards fans have already moved on from discussing the merits of the current coach to debating the pros and cons of potential successors. As player, captain, coach and manager the bond between Lennon and the Celtic support has been strong. But with Champions League qualifiers around the corner the Scottish champions have players to sign and planning to do. And they could no neither so long as the manager had no idea if he was coming or going. For some time now the matter has been coming to a head. It’s remarkable to think now that in the first 100 years of their existence, Celtic had just six managers. Willie Maley was dragged out of office kicking and screaming after 43 years. Jimmy McGrory lasted two full decades despite a marked lack of success. Jock Stein’s remarkable era ran from 1965 to 1978. Meet the new boss? Jackie McNamara and former team-mate Lennon discuss the good old days last month . But football management is now a very different business. Martin O’Neill and Gordon Strachan were successful at Celtic, but the Irishman stayed just five years and Strachan four. Lennon could probably have done another 12 months and become only the third manager in the club’s history to win four-in-a-row. The longest serving Celtic manager since Stein, indeed. But the trick of a successful managerial legacy in Glasgow is knowing when to quit. An Old Firm manager now has a finite shelf life. ‘Four years at Rangers takes a lot out of you,’ Dick Advocaat once said. ‘Every game has to be won. A draw is no good and that is hard for a manager. In the running: Malky Mackay has also been touted for a Celtic return . ‘The expectations are so high. If you can manage Rangers and Celtic you can manage any team in the world.’ The final part of that statement will now be put to the test. People will watch with fascination to see where Lennon surfaces in England, where the average managerial lifespan is 15 months. Norwich City - for now - is still vacant. And his resignation from Celtic makes it easier to have a conversations with Carrow Road chief David McNally. But Malky Mackay was interviewed by the Norwich board last Thursday and has been offered the job. The former Celtic manager is in no hurry to commit himself one way or the other. Partly because the Parkhead post is just one of the alternatives which could now open up. For Celtic fans it’s difficult to fathom why Lennon would sacrifice another crack at the Champions League for life at a smaller English club. The explanation lies in the £64million the Canaries will receive for relegation from the Premiership this season. Last summer Norwich spent big on Gary Hooper. Celtic, in contrast, were only too happy to take the £5.2million. Lennon was subsequently asked to reach the Champions League group stages despite losing his star striker, Victor Wanyama and Kelvin Wilson. This summer he could be asked to do the same again without Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk. All while trying to bed in unproven, £1.5million signings. This is now the Celtic model. By and large it works well. They buy young, sell for a big profit and start the process all over again. Lennon knew this when he accepted the job as manager four years ago. But reaching the Champions League - let alone the last 16 - is becoming more and more difficult. He has asked the Parkhead board to release more funds for a Champions League striker. But Celtic now have a system they like. The days of £6million signings have gone. After three titles, two Scottish Cups and a memorable run to the last 16 of the Champions League, then, Lennon has reached a bold, gutsy decision. He has been linked with a raft of high profile jobs in England. But firm offers have never arrived. Glory days: Lennon lifts the Scottish Cup in 2005 next to McNamara after beating Hibernian 3-0 . That may more of a reflection on English views of the SPFL than on the 42-year-old’s managerial abilities. When Gordon Strachan left Parkhead the best he was offered was a brief, unfulfilling spell with Championship Middlesbrough. And that was after winning three titles against a strong Rangers. Down south they believe Lennon has had it easy in comparison. Yet off the field it has been anything but. Live ammunition through the post. A touchline assault at Tynecastle. Assaults in Glasgow’s west end. Abuse at traffic lights. Hassle at a cup semi-final between Aberdeen and St Johnstone. One day soon the Lennon family will find themselves in Norfolk or another civilised posting in England. They will go to cafes and no one will point fingers. They will go to the seaside, walk freely and fill up the tank in a forecourt on the way home. And, for the first time in years, they won’t be looking over their shoulders as they go. Or have a six foot six bodyguard on speed-dial. Leaving Celtic and Glasgow will be a wrench. Lennon’s partner and son are from the west of Scotland. They have known nothing other than intense, relentless scrutiny. But managing Celtic is no job for a man with his heart in the right place and his head elsewhere. On his fourth anniversary Lennon touched on some of the strains and stresses of his first managerial post. 'The job has become more difficult because you’re under so much analysis – and social media has really gone into overdrive. 'Your personality traits, your tactics – everything is discussed to the nth degree. People out there in cyberworld analyse you to death.' They’ll be at it again in the coming days. Asking why he quit. Wondering where he is off to. If truth be told, we all will.","Lennon's decision to leave Celtic is a gamble .

"Tony Blair’s Number 10 was packed with ‘very beautiful girls who were half in love’ with him while Margaret Thatcher ruled Downing Street through fear, according to political journalist Andrew Marr. The BBC host lifted the lid on the culture inside Number 10 under successive Prime Ministers, and the attitude of staff to their masters. John Major felt ‘besieged’ and Gordon Brown ‘disorganised’ but David Cameron is praised for conducting the business of government ‘very well’. Scroll for video . Tony Blair's Number 10 was 'full of very beautiful girls, half in love with Tony, with Cherie following around with a scowl', according to BBC journalist Andrew Marr . Marr, who has spent three decades reporting on British politics, said staff in Margaret Thatcher's Downing Street were 'terrified' Marr, who now presents a Sunday morning political programme, is a former political editor of the BBC and ex-editor of The Independent newspaper. He has written a novel, Head of State, which is set in a fictional Number 10 in 2017, and draws on his 30 years in political journalism. He contrasts the different approaches Prime Ministers have taken to the way they run their governments, and who they choose to have closest to them. Speaking at Cheltenham Literary Festival, Marr recalled how the Iron Lady’s Number 10 was a picture of calm, dominated by fear. ‘Thatcher had a lot of very bright ex-civil service and business people working for her. There were very tight lines of communication. ‘Almost pin-drop silent in case the PM walked through. They adored her, but were terrified of her,’ he said, according to the Gloucestershire Echo. David Cameron is said to 'conduct the business of Number 10 very well' to the delight of the Civil Service . Staff in Gordon Brown's Number 10 were frightened of 'what mood he was in' while John Major felt 'besieged' throughout his time in office . By contrast, John Major’s inner sanctum was in perpetual crisis, as scandals and bitter divisions dominated the dying days of the Tory administration. Marr said: ‘All the way through, he felt besieged. It felt as if there were forces out there, Thatcherite forces, socialist forces, all ganging up. ‘I was working as a columnist on The Independent, a low-level columnist, and the phone would go, and it was the Prime Minister on the phone bleating about how awful Charles Moore was being in The Telegraph. He would talk and talk. He was sitting there feeling misunderstood and unloved.’ However, his most surprising observations were of Tony Blair’s decade in Number 10 from 1997-2007. ‘His Number 10 was full of very beautiful girls, half in love with Tony, with Cherie following around with a scowl,’ Marr said. ‘There were two or three huge characters, Alastair Campbell, like him or loath him was a huge character. It was a sofa government, very informal, but very tightly organised.’ Marr has used his experience reporting on politics since 1984 for a new book set in a fictional Number 10 in 2017 . Gordon Brown’s time in power was less happy. While he only moved from Number 11, where he spent 10 years as Chancellor, his operation as Prime Minister was notoriously dysfunctional. ‘His Number 10 was more formal and hierarchical and everyone was more scared of the Prime Minister and what mood he was in,’ Marr said. ‘It was much less organised, disorganised in many key ways. Paper didn’t flow through it properly.’ David Cameron, by contrast, is ‘loved by the Civil Service’, Marr claims. ‘All they want is for decisions to be taken clearly. They send him papers in the evening and he’s the first PM since Blair where the papers come back the following morning and he’s read them all, ticked and underlined and said yes or no. He conducts the business of Number 10 very well.’","BBC journalist lifts the lid on three decades reporting on British politics .

"On the surface, the story behind Derby County’s remarkable march to the play-off final is a simple one. Nigel Clough was sacked as manager last September with the team languishing in 14th place, following four mediocre seasons finishing in the middle to lower reaches of the Championship. In came former player and coach Steve McClaren who waved his magic wand – or some such action to that effect – and Derby were galvanised into a run of seven successive wins that propelled them into the top two. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steve McClaren talk ahead of the Championship play-off final . Visionary: Steve McClaren has impressed Derby supporters with his attacking style . Ousted: The Derby board eventually lost patience with Nigel Clough after no signs of improvement . Images of a wally with a brolly were quickly banished as the free-scoring team retained their promotion push, and they go into Saturday’s final as justifiable favourites to beat a far more expensive and experienced QPR side. It is a neat and tidy narrative and one that the club’s owners have been keen to promote, but such a simple interpretation grossly undervalues the diligent work done by the previous manager over the preceding four-and-a-half years. For while McClaren has undoubtedly brought purpose and direction to a young and energetic collection of players, there is no escaping the fact this is ultimately Nigel Clough’s squad – one that he patiently assembled under very trying circumstances. Nine of the 11 players likely to start at Wembley were either bought or nurtured by Clough, and the two great hallmarks of the team – a tight spirit built on humility and an attractive passing style – were very deliberately promoted by the previous regime. In truth, Derby’s rise is not an overnight transformation but one that has been brewing for some time. It is necessary to rewind back to January 2009, when Clough was appointed manager, to appreciate the firm foundations upon which McClaren has sculpted his impressive team. Key: Patrick Bamford (left) and George Thorne (right) have flourished under McClaren since joining on loan . Derby v QPR, Saturday 3pm (Wembley) Follow it live at www.dailymail.co.uk/sport . Clough took over a club in crisis, one in danger of sinking into the third tier of English football less than two years after dropping out of the Premier League. The American owners were realistic about the dire finances and set the son of Derby’s most famous manager the arduous task of rebuilding the club from top to bottom on a shoestring budget. Big earners and prima donnas were ditched and the manager was forced to work with players from the academy and lower leagues. But he did so with a clear long-term vision behind his careful actions. Only hungry, hardworking and humble players would be allowed to wear the shirt. One of the first signings, Jake Buxton, was initially derided as little more than a pub player when he arrived from Burton Albion. But his wholehearted and unselfish performances at centre half showed the path to a strong team spirit, and he is now a cult hero among fans. Sublime: Will Hughes (centre), celebrating his audacious opener in the win over Brighton, is one of the best young talents in the country . Goals: Chris Martin was Derby's top scorer with 22 league goals . While some of Clough’s signings were born with such character, others were given the chance to reinvent themselves by joining this collective ethic. Chris Martin, previously convicted of assault and banned from 68 Suffolk pubs, was plucked from Norwich last year on a free transfer and told to step up to the responsibility of becoming a proper No 9. He is now the key and focus of all Derby’s attacking play, scoring 25 of the team’s goals this season, 22 of them in the league, and assisting in most of the others. Allied to these signings were a clutch of youngsters promoted from the club’s restructured academy, most notably the much-coveted Will Hughes. Two years ago Clough recognised in the slender 17-year-old the courage to receive the ball in any situation and attempt to dominate possession. The team subsequently evolved around the teenager’s vision and one-touch passing, and finally began playing the sort of football befitting a side managed by a man called Clough. Trophies: McClaren won the Dutch Eredivisie whilst with FC Twente . Playing career spanning 13 years mostly for Hull City . Was assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and then twice for England . Managed Middlesbrough, FC Twente (twice), Wolfsburg, Nottingham Forest and now Derby County. Managed England from 2006 until 2007 after previously being Sven Goran Eriksson's No 2 . Trophies include the League Cup in 2004 and the Eredivisie in 2010 . Progress may have been frustratingly slow but this season began with public pronouncements of finishing in the top six, and some of the early signs – a 5-1 away thrashing of Millwall and a glorious goal after a 26-pass move at Yeovil – were promising. But consistency remained elusive and the board lost patience after a 1-0 loss to local rivals Nottingham Forest in September, the third defeat in eight days. While Clough’s sacking was undoubtedly harsh, but the bold decision to hand Steve McClaren the task of fulfilling the team’s potential has been vindicated in spectacular fashion. McClaren has repeatedly acknowledged his great inheritance at Derby, and perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his success is that it is built on no more than minor tinkering and fine-tuning. It may well have been the case that Clough was too close to his project, and a fresh pair of eyes was needed to make the small – but significant – changes that have propelled Derby up the league table. Wise move: Liverpool's Andre Wisdom has been very impressive on loan . While Clough’s team had a tendency to over-elaborate and sometimes keep the ball for the sake of it, McClaren’s charges play with more urgency and forward momentum. While Clough’s desire to pick his best 11 footballers often meant putting square pegs in round holes, McClaren has fitted the players into a clear 4-3-3 formation. And while Clough was inherently cautious and would try to preserve a 1-0 lead, McClaren encourages his players to cast off their inhibitions and chase more goals. He has also been far bolder with substitutions and tactical changes, rescuing many points from seemingly hopeless causes by making an early switch in matches to playing four up front. Records: Craig Bryson has had a breakthrough season in midfield, with 16 league goals . But beyond this the team is largely unchanged, with only minor changes in personnel – most notably the Liverpool loanee Andre Wisdon bringing solidity to a leaky defence and George Thorne borrowed from West Brom to fill the crucial holding midfield position. It is tempting to wonder whether this very same success would have been overseen by Clough, had he been granted more time to see his work come to fruition? Or perhaps it did actually require someone with the experience and insight of McClaren to accelerate the team’s development by instilling greater positivity and self-belief? Rivals: McClaren (centre) during his brief spell in charge of Nottingham Forest . It may even be the case that Derby did Clough a favour by jolting him out of his complacent comfort zone in the town where he grew up, for he is now enjoying at Sheffield United the sort of rapid success that eluded him in his previous job. It is possible he just needed to be liberated from the giant shadow cast by his father’s unmatchable accomplishments at Derby. The management change has also brought a chance of redemption for McClaren, whose image was tarnished by failure in charge of England, a sacking at Wolfsburg and resignations from Nottingham Forest and FC Twente, not to mention the comical local accent he adopted while managing in Holland. He is now flourishing back among those who love him and rediscovering what an excellent manager he can be at the club where he first experienced English football’s top tier as a player and coach. If he returns Derby to the Premier League he will deserve all the plaudits that come his way, but he knows the achievement will rest above all on having the good sense to recognise – where others did not – the many fine attributes in the team built by his predecessor.","Derby face QPR in the Championship play-off final at Wembley on Saturday .

"A near-miss between two Qantas planes would have been even closer had the pilots waited for a confused RAAF air-traffic controller to respond to the collision alarm, a safety report has found. The two Boeing aircraft came too close in October 2012 while flying near the shared civil-military airport at Darwin. Due to a transponder coding mistake, the RAAF approach controller was unable to properly track the 717 twin-engine on the radar. The two Boeing aircraft came too close in October 2012 while flying near the shared civil-military airport at Darwin . After visually spotting the approaching 737, the 717 pilots 'proactively limited their aircraft's descent' to Darwin airport and informed the air-controller . That meant when a predicted collision alarm went off, the RAAF controller had 'a significant level of confusion' as to the most reliable information - resulting in a 15 second delay. Fortunately the pilots of the 717 had already identified the potential threat from their own computer systems. After visually spotting the approaching 737, the 717 pilots 'proactively limited their aircraft's descent' to Darwin airport and informed the air-controller - who advised them to stay at 10,000ft. Unable to pull out of its climb from Darwin airport with such limited notice, the 737 maintained its course for Melbourne. Just 21 seconds after the 717 altered its descent the 737 passed 900ft 'directly' underneath, less than the 1000ft minimum separation requirement. An Australian Transport Safety Bureau report on Thursday found that 'overall there was minimal risk of collision' due to the collision alarms alerting both sets of pilots. However, the gap would have been smaller if not for the proactive response from the pilots. The Air Force welcomed the report's recommendations regarding training systems and safety issues. It advised in a statement that it had already started implementing them. At the time, the RAAF controller was temporarily suspended from duty pending investigations. An update has been sought from Defence.","Two Boeing aircrafts came too close in October 2012 while flying near the shared civil-military airport at Darwin .

"Madame Rosa rose to fame as the matriarch of Paris' Winter Circus by marrying businessman Joseph Bouglione - in a lion's cage - in 1928. Today, at 103, she has outlived her late husband by decades but still has a smile on her face as she reminisces over her extraordinary life. Rosa appears at the circus apartment doorway in Paris in sparkling diamonds, red lipstick and a walking frame and sits down beside her leopard skin rug. Rosa Bouglione, 103, (pictured last month) shows an art piece depicting her and her husband during their circus days as she sits in her Paris apartment . Art piece depicts Rosa Bouglione's wedding day in a lion cage in 1928, on display in her Paris apartment . 'That's Mickey,' exclaims the doyenne of Europe's most famous circus, pointing to all that remains of her former pet. 'He died of old age. We had him a long time,' she says nostalgically, while offering a visitor one of her luxury Swiss chocolates. Soon, anecdotes from the legend come pouring out: how she got married in a lion's den, once entered a posh hotel carrying a baby primate in a hat box, and helped raise a parrot known for its foul use of the French language. The great Madame Rosa is now considered the big top's most eccentric, and oldest, character. Born Rosa Van Been to a performing family in Belgium just in time for Christmas in 1910, two years before the Titanic sank, she went on to find fame and success in Paris by marrying Bouglione, whose claim to fame was buying the Winter Circus in 1934. She's now a French celebrity in her own right. Photographs and paintings seen displayed in Rosa Bouglione's apartment in Paris.  Madame Rosa was born in Belgium to a performing family in time for Christmas in 1910 . She was close friends with Josephine Baker, the American-born French dancer, singer and actress. Madame Rosa also rubbed shoulders with opera diva Maria Callas and actresses Ingrid Bergman and Rita Hayworth — and outlived them all. Madame Rosa, who now has 54 grandchildren and great grandchildren, survived two world wars and the Nazi occupation. But the matriarch of the Winter Circus never let the petty trials of the 20th century spoil her zest for life. She married her husband in a lions' cage instead of a church. She remembers advising the pastor against entering the den for fear he'd get eaten by the big cats and not finish the service. Her protective elephant respected the sanctity of this marriage so much that he once squashed Callas in retribution for getting too close to her husband after one show. Rosa Bouglione points to photographs around her Paris apartment as she talks about her life . 'The elephant practically knocked her over. ... He was jealous,' said Rosa, with a laugh that makes her look decades younger. Laughter, it becomes apparent, is this incredible woman's life-line: the memories and anecdotes she's told a thousand times still make her wrinkled face light up with a touching naivety when she remembers a punchline or conjures up an image that had been sitting for years undusted in her memory archive. Nevertheless, she feels the need to bring along to the interview her 80-year-old son Emilien as her 'memory aid' to help her fill in the gaps. Once she gets started, the stories pour out. There was her other 'child' — a male gorilla she somehow named Jackie. She and her husband once turned up at a top hotel with the baby primate placed in the hat box. The footman said, 'Gosh. Madame's hats are pretty heavy,' said Rosa, chuckling and saying that for the month they were at the hotel no one noticed the gorilla in the room. Jackie also had a taste for wine. The couple's foul-mouthed parrot, Coco, was equally loved, but less jovial. He lived to 45 and would squawk profanities at Rosa, if he was ever ignored. 'I cannot tell you what he would call me... (Parrots) are very, very intelligent.  He could speak very fluently,' she said. Her stories are fantastical, but photos, pictures and her son bear witness. Take for instance her sea voyage to Latin America with her circus in the 50's. In scenes reminiscent of 'The Life of Pi,' she says there was a freak storm, which caused the captain to order that the 12 elephants be thrown overboard to save the ship from sinking. An art piece depicts Madame Rosa and her husband during their circus days . Rosa Bouglione, 103, sits with her son Emilien in her apartment  in Paris . Her son, who was aboard, calls it a 'miracle' when suddenly the storm subsided and the boat remained afloat with the animals safe. 'That was an adventure,' says Madame Rosa. Then there were the celebrities. 'So many, so many,' says her son, who remembers sitting with stars Bergman and Hayworth who had flown in from Hollywood to attend the circus perform beneath the Eiffel Tower. Madame Rosa met Callas, who loved the circus, many times, and had a close relationship with Baker, who died in 1975. 'She was a friend. Amazing,' Rosa says, adding that she used to share costume ideas with the black icon that went on to become a global star for her ground-breaking banana dance. There's a slight sadness when she reminisces over characters in her old stories. 'They're all dead. ... They're all dead,' Rosa repeats several times, sighing in front of the portrait of her husband, who died decades ago. But now that her huge family includes contortionists, acrobats, jugglers, and lion tamers in the popular annual Winter Circus spectacle, their many theatrical get-togethers stop her dwelling on the past. She says the secrets of her eternal youth include hard work, sleeping very little and deadly animals. 'I've always, always been with lions, with panthers, with wolves, with hyenas,' she says. 'I was never scared.' As the interview concludes, Madame Rosa can't resist revealing one more secret of her longevity. 'Fries,' she said, and paused. 'I'm Belgian.'","Madame Rosa has 54 grandchildren and great grandchildren .

DJ Saul said Dorothy can also be used to get out of an awkward situation, by faking a phone call discreetly, and it can even be used a security measure to alert people when the wearer is in trouble. ‘While this is our initial prototype, we’re currently exploring models as small as third of its current size, potentially built into an insole,’ explained  DJ Saul. DJ Saul told MailOnline that the priority is to make the device smaller before discussing a release date or price. He did add that in the ‘near future’, he’s planning to add extra trigger actions such as ordering a pizza. He is also asking people to suggest triggers via the Dorothy homepage.
