"Washington (CNN) -- A Marine who defied orders and braved a blizzard of enemy fire to recover wounded and dead fellow American and Afghan troops during a six-hour firefight in Afghanistan received the Medal of Honor Thursday from President Barack Obama. ""I know that you've grappled with the grief of that day, that you have said that your efforts were somehow a failure because your teammates didn't come home,"" Obama told Dakota Meyer, who became the first living Marine to be recognized with the nation's highest military honor for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq. ""But, as your commander-in-chief, I want you to know it's quite the opposite. You did your duty above and beyond, and you kept the faith with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps that you love."" ""The award honors the men who gave their lives that day, and the men who were in that fight,"" Meyer said, according to a Marine newsletter. ""I didn't do anything more than any other Marine would. I was put in an extraordinary circumstance, and I just did my job."" The incident began before dawn on September 8, 2009, as a patrol made up of Afghan forces and their American trainers were making their way on foot up a narrow valley in Kunar province to meet with elders in a village. Meyer was about a mile away when Taliban fighters ambushed the patrol, firing from three sides, Obama said. Meyer and Staff Sgt. Juan Rodriguez-Chavez could hear the ambush over the radio as the Taliban fighters unleashed a firestorm from nearby hills, Obama said. Soon a number of men were killed and several Afghans and Americans were pinned down, including four members of Meyer's team, Obama said. ""Four times, Dakota and Juan asked permission to go in; four times they were denied,"" Obama said. ""It was, they were told, too dangerous."" But Meyer and Rodriguez-Chavez left their relatively safe location and jumped into a Humvee, with Meyer manning a gun in the turret, his body and head fully exposed to a rain of fire from AK-47s, machine guns, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, Obama said. As they reached wounded Afghan soldiers, Meyer jumped out and loaded them into the Humvee, then drove them back to safety, Obama said. ""Those who were there called it the most intense combat they had ever seen,"" the president said. For a second time, the men drove back into the hail of fire to pick up more wounded Afghans; when one gun jammed, Meyer and Rodriguez-Chavez switched to another vehicle, Obama said. On their third trip, they found a group of wounded Americans ""desperately trying to escape the bullets,"" Obama said. ""Juan wedged the Humvee right into the line of fire, using the vehicle as a shield. With Dakota on the guns, they helped those Americans back to safety as well. ""Dakota later confessed, 'I didn't think I was going to die; I knew I was,'"" Obama said. ""Still, they pushed on."" They made a fourth trip, and then a fifth. On the fifth trip -- now accompanied by others -- they reached the bodies of the four members of Meyer's team. ""Dakota jumped out and ran toward them, drawing all those enemy guns on himself, bullets kicking up the dirt all around him,"" Obama said. ""Dakota and the others who had joined him knelt down, picked up their comrades and, through all those bullets, all the smoke and all the chaos, carried them out, one by one."" Meyer agreed to accept the medal in their names: 1st Lt. Michael Johnson, Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, Petty Officer Third Class James Layton and Gunnery Sgt. Edwin Johnson. ""I was a failure,"" Meyer told CNN last fall. ""My guys died. That was my whole team."" Neither Obama nor the Marines saw it that way. A defense official with knowledge of the award process last fall said that just before he retired, the U.S. Marine commandant, Gen. James Conway, recommended Meyer for the nation's highest award for bravery. The actions of Meyer, 23, saved the lives of 13 U.S. Marines and soldiers and 23 Afghan soldiers, according to the Marines' Medal of Honor account. He also is credited with killing at least eight Taliban insurgents during the incident. For his role in the battle, Staff Sgt. Juan Rodriguez-Chavez received the Navy Cross, the second-highest decoration that may be bestowed on Marines. Meyer, who serves in the Inactive Ready Reserve of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve as a sergeant in his home state of Kentucky, said in November that he didn't want to discuss details of the incident because it was still difficult to think about. On Wednesday, Obama and Meyer had a beer together on the patio outside the Oval Office. According to a series of tweets by White House spokesman Jay Carney, when a member of Obama's staff called Meyer over the weekend to prepare, ""Meyer made a special request. ... Meyer asked the staffer if he could have a beer with the president."" Meyer is only the second Marine to earn the Medal of Honor from the current wars. In April 2004, Marine Cpl. Jason Dunham was leading a patrol in an Iraqi town near the Syrian border when a person in a vehicle dropped a grenade. Dunham hurled himself on top it, using his helmet to try to blunt the force of the blast. He died eight days later and received the honor posthumously.

"(CNN)A Sony executive said Saturday that a cyberattack was to blame for the network woes that have been plaguing PlayStation and others since Christmas Day. ""The video game industry has been experiencing high levels of traffic designed to disrupt connectivity and online gameplay,"" Catherine Jensen, Sony's vice president of Consumer Experience said on PlayStation's blog. ""Multiple networks, including PSN, have been affected over the last 48 hours. PSN engineers are working hard to restore full network access and online gameplay as quickly as possible,"" she said. ""If you received a PlayStation console over the holidays and have been unable to log onto the network, know that this problem is temporary and is not caused by your game console,"" Jensen wrote. Microsoft's Xbox Live network also were hobbled by a slowdown on one of the busiest gaming days of the year. But, unlike Sony, Xbox spokesman Sean McCarthy told CNN that  ""we don't share info on the root cause of specific issues."" PlayStation gamers exasperated . Jensen's announcement was an about-face compared to Sony's previous messages since the ordeal began -- mostly tweets that were sparse, vague and almost always ended with 'thank you for your continued patience."" But based on the overall sentiment expressed in the comments posted to message boards and on Twitter, the collective patience among PlayStation users had long since run out -- especially when rival Xbox appeared to be back online. ""@AskPlayStation any chance you guys could consult with #xboxlive engineers on how to get #psn back up?"" @robbhunt asked on Twitter. ""They seem to have things figured out."" @LilGizmoe_ tweeted a picture of her entertainment console at her house in Montana with this caption: ""I wish PSN would come back online. Bought hubby a PS4 for Christmas. Only thing its good for right now is a tv stand."" A great deal of the contempt however was reserved for Lizard Squad, a band of black-hat hackers who said from the get-go that they were behind the attack. ""This is so frustrating,"" wrote calin75. ""The hackers think they're hurting Sony, but the ones that really pay for this bull crap are the innocent users."" CNN cannot confirm the identity or claims of Lizard Squad, but Sony's acknowledgment that this was indeed a cyberattack gives little reason to doubt their claims. In August, the group said it took down the PlayStation network in the same fashion: by flooding it with illegitimate traffic, something called a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) in the video game world. As CNNMoney reported at the time, when John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment, tweeted about those ""large scale"" attacks, he became a Lizard Squad target himself -- even at 30,000 feet. ""We have been receiving reports that @j_smedley's plane #362 from DFW to SAN has explosives on-board, please look into this,"" the group tweeted to American Airlines, resulting in the flight being diverted. Earlier this month, Sony was again hit with a similar outage. Lizard Squad not only took credit for that one too, but it promised more ""Christmas presents"" would soon be coming. ""Unlike Santa, we don't like giving all of our Christmas presents out on one day. This entire month will be entertaining,"" Lizard Squad tweeted. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Steve Almasy, Brian Stelter and Tony Marco contributed to this report.","Sony exec says PlayStation's network disrupted on purpose .

"Far be it for me to offer unsolicited advice to Sarah Palin. She's built a very successful career out of going rogue and certainly doesn't need any tips from me. And, as an occasional pundit, a political influencer and a private citizen, she's free to throw her weight behind anyone she wants. But I just have to say it: Newt Gingrich? Really? Now, I'm not in the camp of conservative elites who think she's seen her best days and should politely retire to obscurity. If anything, the premiere of ""Game Change"" on HBO on Saturday is proof that she's still relevant; she's got considerable influence over a certain wing of the party. And so with great power comes great responsibility. Is Newton Leroy Gingrich the most responsible pick? Of all the remaining candidates, in fact, the one that makes the least sense is Newt. Mitt Romney I could see, if she wanted to bring the party together. Rick Santorum I could see for his social conservatism, strong Christian faith and similar family stories. I could even see Ron Paul for his ""throw the bums out"" and ""end the Fed"" rogue-isms. But Newt? When rumors first started swirling that Palin might back the former House speaker and self-appointed ""cheerful"" candidate, Gingrich was surging then. She said she'd vote for him in South Carolina if she could. She wanted to keep the primary alive, she said. And, playing to Newt's strength at the time, she urged ""more debates"" and ""more vetting of candidates."" But now, with Newt's ham-fisted campaign out of mojo, and no debates on the horizon, it would seem like a good time to jump off that train and get behind Romney or Santorum. Instead, she doubled down Tuesday, telling Fox Business Network that she voted for Gingrich in the Alaska caucuses, where he finished dead last. And why? ""I have appreciated what he has stood for,"" she said. ""He has been the underdog in many of these primary races and these caucuses."" Again, Palin's free to like any candidate she wants, and those would be valid arguments, if they were true. What Newt has stood for, both during his political career and during this campaign, sits in total contradiction to what Palin has stood for since becoming a public figure. She's for small government; he's shown a disturbing penchant for big government solutions. She champions Washington outsiders and rails against the establishment; he's the epitome of establishment, and has been firmly encamped inside the Beltway for decades. The very people who appreciate Palin should be the same people who despise Gingrich. And he's hardly been an ""underdog."" With the backing of billionaire financier Sheldon Adelson and the benefit of serious name recognition, he's enjoyed the money, media attention and opportunity that other GOP candidates didn't. If Newt's been an underdog, I'm sure Jon Huntsman and Michele Bachmann would have been happy to switch places. The truth is, Newt isn't the ""little guy"" in any sense of the word. And if that were truly Palin's criteria, there are actual little guys, such as Buddy Roemer and Gary Johnson to champion. Or even better, she doesn't have to support any of them. Maybe Palin's got a master plan in which she makes a late run at the presidency and puts Newt on her ticket. Still, it seems like an incongruous pick and waste of her considerable influence among far-right conservatives. But I'm sure she knows what she's doing.","S.E. Cupp says she's not one to question Sarah Palin's instincts, but Newt Gingrich?
She says popular Palin could be using her sway to support a more viable GOP candidate .
She says many of Gingrich's attributes run counter to what Palin has said she stands for .
Cupp: If Palin has a plan that makes squandering support on Gingrich logical, it's not obvious ."
"(CNN)Even by Malaysian standards, this flooding is epic. Neighborhoods turned into islands surrounded by a sea of murky brown water. Streets doubling as rivers. Cars swept away and toppled over. The flooding has forced more than 132,000 people to evacuate, Malaysia's official Bernama news agency said. Strong currents and interrupted power supply are adding to the chaos, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak told reporters. ""Clean water supply too cannot be delivered, and flood victims at the temporary relief centers had to endure darkness without electric supply,"" he said, according to Bernama. The flooding ravaging Malaysia started more than a week ago. While the region is accustomed to monsoons, the ""northeast monsoon"" that has gripped Malaysia, Indonesia and southern Thailand is particularly harsh. Here's how it works, CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said Saturday: . Strong high pressure develops over Eastern Europe and China and strengthens northeasterly winds from the South China Sea, bringing heavier rainfall over Malaysia, Indonesia and southern Thailand. And it's going to get worse. Another 100 millimeters (4 inches) of rain could fall over the next two days near the Malaysia-Thailand border, he said. ""That leaves open all kinds of possibilities -- more flooding, and the possibility of landslides and mudslides,"" Van Dam said. Across the Bay of Bengal, Sri Lanka has been hit hard, too. Kandy, in the center of the island nation, received more than twice the average monthly rainfall in just the past eight days, Van Dam said. CNN's Radina Gigova contributed to this report.","More than 132,000 Malaysians have been evacuated .

"The arrest of Georgia megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar brought renewed attention to his message of the Prosperity Gospel, controversial to some and faith-fulfilling to its followers. Dollar, who was arrested last week after allegedly assaulting his teenage daughter, is the founder and pastor of World Changers Church International in suburban Atlanta. It claims about 30,000 members and has a multimillion-dollar sanctuary that resembles a golden-domed spaceship atop a hill. Dollar said in a statement he would never harm his children and that the facts in the case would be handled privately. Prosperity ministers preach that God rewards the faithful with wealth and spiritual gifts. Pastors such as T.D. Jakes, Dollar, and Joel Osteen have become the Prosperity Gospel's most well known preachers, building megachurches and business empires with a message equating piety with prosperity. While popular in the black church, it is not a solely black phenomenon, as seen in the ministry of Osteen, a best-selling author and megapastor at Lakewood Church in Houston. The church website says it is considered to be the largest church in America, with more than 38,000 attendees. The Prosperity Gospel is a form of evangelical Christianity that largely grew out of the booming economy of postwar America, says Jonathan Walton, a professor of Christian Morals at Harvard and author of ""Watch This! Televangelism and African American Religious Culture."" The theology's emphasis is on God's promised generosity in this life and the ability of believers to claim it for themselves. If God loves us, it teaches, then God will reward us with a new home, a good job, or good health, Walton says. God wants us to be prosperous. One of the problems that conservatives tend to have with prosperity theology is its focus on material prosperity, says Ben Phillips, a theology professor at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Houston. ""The Prosperity Gospel tends to mask the greatest need that any individual has, and that's to be reconciled to God through faith in Christ,"" Phillips says. ""The point is that God is the ultimate good,"" he continues. ""Knowing Him, being in a relationship with Him ... in which He is God and we are His creatures, that is where joy is found."" Believers may argue, however, that material wealth is evidence of being in covenant with God, says Michael Long, a teacher of religious studies at Elizabethtown College and editor of the book, ""I Must Resist: Bayard Rustin's Life in Letters."" Those believers might say material goods are a side effect of believing in God and Christ, he says. ""The focus is on getting right with God, but you know that when you get right with God, you're going to get something for it."" While the theology may attract more followers in a time of economic boom, the fact that it focuses so much on the individual and controlling one's own heart is a comfort in tough economic times as well, Long says. Tom Brown, senior pastor of the Word of Life Church in El Paso, Texas, says wealth and prosperity are what God desires for us. ""Just as any parent enjoys watching their kids have fun, God delights in watching His children enjoy what money can buy,"" Brown writes on the website for his ministry. ""I believe God is love and He desires the best life we can have."" Believers must then use their wealth to help others, Brown says -- and that to have money for its own sake is pointless. Phillips says it's true that the Bible teaches Christians to care for the poor, sick and needy, ""but the Bible also teaches that God uses and permits suffering in the lives of people for His own ends and purposes."" He points to the Book of James, which says we must value the trials in our life because they shape our character. ""Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position. But the rich should take pride in their humiliation -- since they will pass away like a wild flower,"" it says in James 1:9-10. Critics may say prosperity followers are wrong, but believers say they are sincere, Walton says. The pastors may be pop culture celebrities, but it doesn't mean their congregations don't find fulfillment in the message. The pastors' wealth, derided by some as evidence of hypocrisy, could also simply be seen as evidence of their faith, Walton says. ""The wealth is part of their authority,"" he says.","Creflo Dollar preaches the ""Prosperity Gospel""
The theology teaches that God rewards the faithful with wealth and gifts .
Critics say it focuses on material prosperity rather than a relationship with God ."
"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- Security forces in Morocco appear to be intensifying their hard-line crackdown on demonstrators, with a second violent clash over the weekend leaving scores of youths injured. On Sunday there were bloody battles on the streets between a youth movement and police. It was the second weekend in a row that police have beaten protesters with long truncheons. Fevrier 20, Morocco's Facebook youth movement, staged a rally in the country's commercial capital without permission from the government Sunday -- sparking waves of police violence and in some cases panicking from individual officers, according to at least one YouTube video clip that shows an officer kicking and striking an old woman caught in the frenzy at least once with a baton. The same clip shows a young man on the ground being beaten and kicked by officers while other colleagues on motorcycles accelerate through crowds striking protesters with long batons. Mounaim Ouihi, one of the organizers of Sunday's protest, said 15,000 people gathered in the Sbata district of Casablanca to demand more democratic freedoms, jobs and better social conditions. He said police sealed off streets around the district to block people, swelling the numbers, then sent several 30-strong squads of truncheon-wielding officers charging into the crowd. ""There was a lot of violence, and we are now calling a halt,"" Ouihi said. ""This protest has again sent out our message demanding freedom."" Yet perhaps it's a message that has fallen on deaf ears in Rabat, the country's administrative capital. The government's chief spokesman said the demonstration was banned and that police acted in response to what he described as provocative behavior by the protesters. The protesters ""were warned that this protest was illegal but their behavior was provocative,"" Communications Minister Khalid Naciri said. He added that there had been counter-protests in Casablanca, Rabat and Fez by citizens who wanted to express their anger at the damage to the Moroccan economy caused by the Fevrier 20 protests. ""We are concerned about the violence used ... We call for restraint in the use of force and respect of fundamental freedoms,"" European Union spokesperson Natasha Butler said. ""... We call on Morocco to maintain its track record in allowing citizens to demonstrate peacefully. We are following these demonstrations very closely, and encourage all parties to engage in a peaceful dialogue with a view to finding solutions to the issues raised by the demonstrators."" In Morocco, unlike many other Arab countries, demonstrations are usually permitted, as long as a formal application is made to the state. The youth movement claims it has never applied for permits and it is just recently that the government is using this as a pretext to hit it hard. ""Now we are just a few weeks away from the constitution being announced by the king's own committee and they don't want any more protests,"" said a protester who wished to be known only as Imad and who was injured in the battle Sunday. Imad claims the police injured ""around 100 people"" who took to the streets Sunday as an immediate show of defiance to the previous weekend. Then, Moroccan police quelled a number of protests across the entire country, stopping supporters of the youth movement demonstrating against corruption and demanding more jobs. The May 22 demonstrations ended in a huge number of casualties and arrests. According to Fevrier 20, some 90 protesters were hurt, six with fractured arms and two with fractured legs. Neither Sunday's nor May 22's demonstrations were legal, according to the government.","Protesters say police on motorcycles struck out with truncheons .

"(CNN)The artificial breathing support for a clinically dead woman who is 18 weeks pregnant has been switched off by the Irish hospital treating her, an official with detail knowledge of the case said Saturday. Ireland's High Court ruled Friday that doctors can withdraw the artificial breathing support as there is ""no reasonable prospect"" her unborn child will survive. The 26-year-old woman was pronounced clinically dead on December 3 after suffering serious brain trauma. Prior to the High Court ruling, doctors had refused to turn off the machine providing artificial breathing support out of concern for the rights of the unborn child. Under Ireland's constitution, the unborn have the same right to life as the mother. Abortion is illegal except in cases where the mother's life is at ""real and substantial risk"" due to medical complications or the threat of suicide. The court said in its ruling that this was a ""tragic and unfortunate case,"" and that medical experts showed no medical or ethical basis to continue ""with a process described as verging on the grotesque."" The woman had two children ages 6 and 4 years and was engaged. Ireland's Pro Life Campaign also called the case tragic, but said the court proceedings were necessary. ""While it is very difficult for the families concerned that cases like this sometimes end up in court, the fact is that it is a sign of a healthy democracy that life and death issues are taken seriously and appropriately determined,"" the group's Ruth Cullen said in the statement.","Doctors in Ireland remove breathing support from a pregnant woman .

"Two bombs struck near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday, turning a celebration into a bloody scene of destruction. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said Monday night that the death toll had risen to three. Scores were injured at the scene. One of the dead was an 8-year-old boy, according to a state law enforcement source. Hospitals reported at least 144 people are being treated, with at least 17 of them in critical condition and 25 in serious condition.  At least eight of the patients are children. At least 10 people injured had limbs amputated, according to a terrorism expert briefed on the investigation. Several of the patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital suffered injuries to lower limbs that will require ""serial operations"" in the coming days, trauma surgeon Peter Fagenholz said Monday night. Some injuries were so severe amputations were necessary, Fagenholz added. Full horror of the day emerges in emergency rooms . In Washington, President Barack Obama vowed, ""Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups, will feel the full weight of justice."" Boston ""is a tough and resilient town,"" he said, adding that Americans will stand by Bostonians ""every single step of the way."" 'Like a huge cannon' The terrorist attack, near the marathon's finish line, triggered widespread screaming and chaos, shattered windows and barricades and sent smoke billowing into the air at Copley Square. The blasts were about 50 to 100 yards apart, officials said, on a stretch of the marathon course lined with spectators cheering runners through the final yards of a 26-mile, 385-yard endurance feat. ""It felt like a huge cannon,"" a witness told CNN about one of the blasts. Allan Panter, a doctor who was near the finish line waiting for his wife to finish the race, told CNN he was standing about 20 to 25 feet from the first blast. He said he treated victims on the street after the explosion. ""I saw at least six to seven people down next to me,"" he said. ""They protected me from the blast. One lady expired. One gentleman lost both his (lower) limbs. Most of the injuries were lower extremities."" Flights banned over Boston Marathon blast site . Bill Iffrig, 78 and a veteran marathoner, was nearing the finish when ""the shock waves just hit my whole body and my legs just started jittering around."" Iffrig, who can be seen in video of the explosion wearing an orange tank top, was helped to his feet by an event volunteer and had just a scratch from his fall, he told CNN. Federal authorities are classifying the bombings as a terrorist attack, but it's not clear whether the origin was domestic or foreign, a federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said. A federal law enforcement official told CNN that both bombs were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material, suggesting that the packages used in the attack were crude explosive devices. Another explosive device found . Authorities in Boston found at least one other explosive device that they were dismantling, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said. Rep. Bill Keating of Massachusetts, meanwhile, said two more were found. One unexploded device was found at a hotel on Boylston Street near the bomb site and another unexploded device was found at an undisclosed location, Keating, a Democrat and member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said. He called the bombing a ""sophisticated, coordinated, planned attack."" FBI to take lead in investigation, seeks bomb 'signature' It was unclear who may have planted the marathon bombs.  There were no credible threats before the race, a state government official said. There is no suspect in custody, but many people are being questioned, Davis said. Investigators warned police to be on the lookout for a ""darker-skinned or black male"" with a possible foreign accent in connection with the attack, according to a law enforcement advisory obtained by CNN. The man was seen with a black backpack and sweatshirt and was trying to get into a restricted area about five minutes before the first explosion, the lookout notice states. Also, a Saudi national with a leg wound was under guard at a Boston hospital in connection with the bombings, but investigators cannot say he is involved at this time and he is not in custody, a law enforcement official said Monday evening. In addition to scrutinizing images of surveillance cameras in the area, the FBI likely was issuing subpoenas for records from cell towers in the area to isolate and trace calls from around Copley Square at the time of the blasts, according to a former federal law enforcement official who now works in the intelligence community. The unexploded devices that were recovered could provide a treasure trove of information such as fingerprints and indications of the bomb maker's design, and from the bombs that did explode, investigators would be looking for fragments and anything indicating the ""signature"" of the bomb makers, the official told CNN. As authorities searched the scene, numerous suspicious packages were found, possibly because people fled the area, leaving items behind.  Investigators were checking them. All off-duty Boston police were called in. The Marriott hotel at Copley Place was evacuated as a precaution. The Lenox Hotel was also evacuated as a precaution, the Boston Globe reported. 'Horrific day' Crowds were in the area watching the runners take part in the world's oldest annual marathon. It was also Patriots Day, commemorating the opening battle of the Revolutionary War. Within seconds, the festive occasion turned into devastation. ""This is a horrific day in Boston,"" Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said in a statement. ""My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured. I have been in touch with the president, Mayor (Thomas) Menino and our public safety leaders. Our focus is on making sure that the area around Copley Square is safe and secured. I am asking everyone to stay away from Copley Square and let the first responders do their jobs."" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke with FBI Director Robert Mueller and U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, a Justice Department official said. Holder has directed the full resources of the Justice Department to be deployed to ensure the matter is fully investigated, the official said. The Federal Aviation Administration placed a flight restriction over the site of the blasts. Other cities, including New York and Washington, tightened security as a result.  Following standard protocol, the White House cleared out an area in front of the West Wing. Mike Baingon, who works at the Atlantic Fish Company in Boston, said an explosion took place in front of the restaurant and that he was right by the front door at the time. The explosions occurred at about 2:45 p.m., more than two hours after the first of the race's nearly 27,000 runners had crossed the finish line, CNN Producer Matt Frucci reported. The race was halted as was subway service into the area. Troops from the Massachusetts National Guard, already at the site as part of the marathon's security and crowd-management plan, were assisting police as well.

"(CNN) -- The two-match ban imposed on Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney for swearing in front of a television camera has been upheld by the English Football Association (FA) after an appeal by the player that the punishment was excessive was rejected. The decision means the England international -- who scored United's only goal in a 1-0 Champions League quarterfinal victory against Chelsea on Wednesday -- will now miss a crunch domestic cup semifinal against city rivals Manchester City on April 16 as well as Saturday's English Premier League clash with Fulham. The ban was initially imposed by the FA after Rooney shouted expletives directly in front of a TV camera during his hat-trick celebration in a 4-2  league win against West Ham last Saturday. The 25-year-old said his outburst had been provoked by ""continuous verbal abuse from West Ham supporters."" But in an official statement released on Thursday, the FA said: ""Rooney had admitted a charge for the use of offensive, insulting and/or abusive language, but claimed that the automatic penalty of two games was clearly excessive. ""The commission did not accept the claim and Rooney will begin the standard two-match suspension with immediate effect."" In a statement issued through his spokesman Ian Monk to CNN, Wayne Rooney said he was ""gutted"" to miss two matches. ""I am not the first player to have sworn on TV and I won't be the last,"" the statement read. ""Unlike others who have been caught swearing on camera, I apologized immediately and yet I am the only person banned for swearing. ""That doesn't seem right. I have to accept that what's happened has happened and move on from here,"" Rooney added. Manchester United also issued a statement on their official website expressing disappointment in the FA's decision to uphold the ban. ""The club put forward a very strong case to have the punishment reduced, which was unsuccessful,"" the statement read. ""Wayne Rooney apologized immediately after the match and the club now wishes to move to on to what hopefully will be a very exciting conclusion to the season."" The FA's decision came a day after soft drink company Coca-Cola announced they planned to discontinue their $980,000-a-year (£600,000) contract with the footballer. ""Our contract with Wayne Rooney came to an end last year and we mutually agreed that we would not renew our relationship. We're really proud of the work we've done with Wayne over the years [and] we wish Wayne well in his career,"" Coke told CNN in a statement.

"Washington (CNN) -- There is a good chance NATO pressure will encourage Libyan tyrant Moammar Gadhafi to leave power, the U.S. NATO commander told Congress Tuesday, but the opposition that could come in the Libyan leader's wake has ""flickers"" of al Qaeda. While there is a wide range of possible outcomes in Libya, running from a static stalemate to Gadhafi cracking, there is a ""more than reasonable"" chance of Gadhafi leaving power, Adm. James Stavridis said before the Senate Armed Services Committee, . But potential ""flickers"" of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements have been seen in intelligence regarding the Libyan opposition, which is poised to take power if Gadhafi leaves, Stavridis said. However, he added there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. Stavridis is also the commander of U.S. European Command. ""The intelligence that I'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that I'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against Col. Gadhafi,"" Stavridis added. The comments come the same day as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of Libya's opposition in London. Clinton and the heads of 40 other countries met Tuesday to discuss Libya's future. A senior counterterrorism official, unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record, backed up Stavridis' assessment, downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition. There is probably ""a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda"" in Libya among the rebels, ""but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates,"" the official said. Al Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years. It ""wouldn't be surprising if small numbers -- a handful""-- of extremists or al Qaeda are in Libya. ""It's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition,"" the official said, but ""the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya."" If Gadhafi's forces cease fighting there would be a series of decisions on how NATO should proceed. Leading the senators through the NATO command chain, Stavridis said the intelligence and ground assessments would work their way up through NATO, first going through Canadian Gen. Charles Bouchard leading the NATO operation in Libya, then up to Stavridis and eventually going up to the United Nations for the ultimate decision on course of action, Stavridis said. ""I think there would be actually another level that this discussion would have to go to, which would be the United Nations since the authority for NATO to participate in this operation is under the United Nations Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973,"" Stavridis pointed out. During this process there would be a pause in NATO activity over Libya. But for now the fight is still very much on. No-fly air zones have been set up to allow air assets to strike Libyan forces if the civilian population is threatened, Stavridis said, going beyond a basic no-fly zone patrol mission. For the first time, A-10 and AC-130 ground attack aircraft were used over the weekend in Libya, Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at a press briefing on Monday. These aircraft fire machine gun rounds from cannons, up to thousands of rounds a minute, and due to their low-altitude flying ability provide more precision in densely populated areas. On Monday night, one A-10 aircraft attacked Libyan coast guard ships in the port of Misrata after reports were confirmed that the ships were firing at merchant vessels. NATO is set to take control of the full operation in Libya including protecting civilians on Thursday, greatly easing the financial costs on the United States, which has already hit $550 million as of Monday, according to Pentagon figures. Of those costs, 60% were for munitions, the Pentagon said, including Tomahawk missiles, which cost $1.4 million each. The United States has launched approximately 200 since the beginning of the operation. ""Future costs are highly uncertain,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kessler said, but the U.S. expects to incur another $40 million in costs over the next three weeks. After the transition to NATO control is complete, the Pentagon expects the cost of the U.S. support operation to drop significantly, costing $40 million per each subsequent month.

"(CNN) -- ""Terrorist funding emanating from Saudi Arabia remains a serious concern."" So states a cable prepared for the visit of U.S. Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke to the kingdom earlier this year. It is one of several that have appeared on the WikiLeaks site to indicate that despite some progress, the flow of cash to extremist groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan from individuals and charities in the Gulf has certainly not been halted. The cable, written by U.S. Ambassador James B Smith, says that the Saudis are ""cooperating more actively than at any previous point to respond to terrorist financing concerns raised by the United States, and to investigate and detain financial facilitators of concern."" It says the Saudi Ministry of Interior had begun to detain individuals involved in funding networks for groups such as Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT), an extremist Pakistani group that carried out the Mumbai attacks in 2008, the Taliban, and Hamas. But it says donors in Saudi Arabia ""continue to constitute a source of funding to Sunni extremist groups worldwide, especially during the Hajj and Ramadan."" And it adds the kingdom remains ""almost completely dependent on the CIA to provide analytic support and direction for its counterterrorism operations."" The U.S. Treasury has led efforts to block sources of terrorist funding, establishing the ""Illicit Finance Task Force"" and sending specialists to Kabul, Afghanistan, and elsewhere to help follow the money. It also established an office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 2008. Treasury sources said earlier this year that other Gulf states had been less co-operative than the Saudis; and other cables obtained by WikiLeaks describe hundreds of millions of dollars in cash being flown from Kabul to various destinations in the region. The Saudi authorities have made some high-profile arrests in the last two years. Ambassador Smith's cable says the Ministry of the Interior timed its announcement in August 2009 regarding the arrest of 44 terrorist supporters ""to deter potential donors from giving money to suspected terrorist groups during Ramadan."" However, one leaked cable sent by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in December 2009 noted that ""it has been an ongoing challenge to persuade Saudi officials to treat terrorist financing emanating from Saudi Arabia as a strategic priority."" It adds: ""Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide"" -- running into millions of dollars. ""Riyadh has taken only limited action to disrupt fundraising for the UN 1267-listed Taliban and LeT-groups that are also aligned with al-Qaeda,"" the cable from Clinton says. It also expresses concern that the Taliban might use the cover of reconciliation talks to raise funds. U.N. Security Council resolution 1267 lists groups and individuals accused of involvement with al Qaeda, the Taliban and other extremist groups. It is not only Saudi sources of cash for terrorists that have caused concern. The cable sent by Secretary Clinton notes that while Kuwait has clamped down on domestic terror suspects it ""has been less inclined to take action against Kuwait-based financiers and facilitators plotting attacks outside of Kuwait."" In particular, the cable says that while the United States had designated the Kuwait-based Revival of Islamic Heritage Society for providing support to al Qaeda and associated groups, the government of Kuwait ""has not taken significant action to address or shut down RIHS headquarters or its branches."" Tareq al Essa, the society's chairman, has denied allegations that RIHS has links with terrorist groups. The leaked cables also express concern that weak regulatory oversight in the United Arab Emirates (a growing financial hub) ""makes it vulnerable to abuse by terrorist financiers and facilitation networks."" As for Qatar, the cable from Clinton says it has ""adopted a largely passive approach to cooperating with the U.S. against terrorist financing. Qatar's overall level of CT [counter-terrorism] cooperation with the U.S. is considered the worst in the region."" The cable asserts that although Qatar's security services have the capability to deal with direct threats and occasionally have put that capability to use, ""they have been hesitant to act against known terrorists out of concern for appearing to be aligned with the U.S. and provoking reprisals."" A long section on terrorist financing in Pakistan repeats the frequent charge that ""some officials from the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) continue to maintain ties with a wide array of extremist organizations, in particular the Taliban, LeT and other extremist organizations."" It says a ""network of social service institutions readily provides extremist organizations with recruits, funding and infrastructure for planning new attacks."" Among the groups identified are ""UN-proscribed NGOs al Rashid Trust and al Akhtar Trust, and all successor organizations that continue to funnel money and provide other forms of support to the Taliban and LeT.""","U.S. cables published by WikiLeaks assess terrorism funding in the Gulf region .

"(CNN) -- The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan arrived off the coast of Japan Sunday to support Japanese forces in disaster relief operations, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement. More U.S. aid -- in the form of equipment, staffers and search-and-rescue teams -- was expected to arrive Sunday to address the widespread devastation caused by the 8.9-magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunami. Near Honshu, Japan, the USS Ronald Reagan will support the Japan Self-Defense Force by providing refueling operations for Japanese helicopters and transporting the island country's troops to disaster areas, according to the Pentagon statement. Accompanying the Reagan are the guided-missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville and the destroyer USS Preble. The United States is part of a growing international effort offering relief to Japan, whose government said it had received interest from 49 countries and the European Union. In addressing a potential crisis, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent two experts in boiling-water nuclear reactors to Japan as crews there flooded the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant with sea water in hopes of preventing a meltdown of its core Saturday. A concrete building surrounding the reactor experienced an explosion caused by a failed pump system Saturday, but the reactor wasn't damaged, Japanese officials said. ""We have some of the most expert people in this field in the world working for the NRC and we stand ready to assist in any way possible,"" NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko said in a statement. In Shiroishi, a town near the area hardest hit by the quake, two SH-60 helicopters from U.S. Naval Air Facility Atsugi delivered 1,500 pounds of rice and bread donated by people in Ebina, southeast of Tokyo, the U.S. 7th Fleet said in a statement Saturday. The fleet is headquartered in Yokosuka, just outside Tokyo. Two destroyers, the USS McCampbell and USS Curtis Wilbur, were off Japan's Boso Peninsula, which shelters Tokyo Bay, and were preparing to assist Japanese authorities with at-sea rescue and recovery operations, the 7th Fleet said. An additional destroyer, the USS Mustin, will depart Yokosuka on Sunday. Eight other U.S. ships were en route to Japan from various locations, set to arrive Sunday or later in the week, according to the 7th Fleet. One, the USS Tortuga, departed Japan on Saturday night to pick up two helicopters in South Korea and would return in about two days. Three ships composing the USS Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group also are among the eight ships, the military said. Meanwhile, the III Marine Expeditionary Force, based on the island of Okinawa, south of Japan, said it was ""prepositioning forces and supplies in support of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations."" The force was sending staffers, a cargo aircraft and transport helicopters to the mainland, it said in a written statement. Additional aircraft and supplies will be sent in the next few days. The military assistance operation is known as Operation Tomodachi, or ""friendship,"" the statement said. The name was chosen by the Japanese. U.S. Forces Japan, based at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo, is the lead military command for coordinating humanitarian assistance, the military said. Shortly after the quake struck, the air base was designated as an alternate airfield for flights that could not land at Tokyo's Narita Airport, and it received a handful of commercial flights. A total of 570 passengers and 29 crew members were taken to the Taiyo Community Center, where they received food, water, lodging and bedding overnight, the air base said in a statement. The base itself converted a facility into a shelter for another 600 people. ""We have units from all of our services, with a multitude of capabilities, from medical to communications to civil engineering, poised and ready to support where needed,"" John Roos, U.S. ambassador to Japan, told reporters Saturday. ""The bottom line: Our military is working closely with their Japanese counterparts to support where requested and needed."" The U.S. Agency for International Development said it was deploying two urban search-and-rescue teams, one from Fairfax County, Virginia, and the second from Los Angeles County. The Virginia team departed Washington on Saturday and was stopping in Los Angeles to pick up the second team. Both teams -- composed of 150 people and 12 canines trained to find survivors -- are set to arrive Monday morning in Misawa, Japan, where they will ""immediately begin the search for live victims"" alongside Japanese and other international teams, USAID said. Journalists, including two CNN staffers, are traveling with the teams. Much of the teams' gear was shipped ahead. The kits include sophisticated detection equipment such as cameras and listening devices, as well as jackhammers and giant saws for use in freeing trapped people. The Virginia team is also bringing swift-water rescue specialists and four inflatable boats. The dogs, meanwhile, are traveling in seats alongside their handlers on the 767. They include Cadillac, a Labrador who worked with Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Jasmine Segura to find victims after the earthquake in Haiti last year. Others have worked in Turkey and elsewhere. A USAID Disaster Assistance Response team is already in Japan, the agency said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and its partner agencies are on standby in case their assistance is needed, the agency said Friday. California Gov. Jerry Brown said in a news release that he has ""directed California's Emergency Management Agency to make state resources available to the Japanese government."" Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig even promised assistance from the major league. Citing ""our shared love of baseball for more than a century,"" Selig said in a statement that Japan is ""a particularly special place to us"" and that the league will provide aid in the coming days and weeks. The American Red Cross is communicating with the Japanese Red Cross Society and its global partners, according to a statement from the agency. So far, the American Red Cross has not received any requests for blood. The organization is encouraging people with loved ones in Japan to use the Red Cross ""Safe and Well"" website, an online tool that helps families connect during natural disasters and emergencies. On Friday, President Barack Obama pledged to help the island country. ""I offer our Japanese friends whatever assistance is needed,"" he said. ""Today's events remind us how fragile life can be."" Roos said that as of Saturday, there had been no confirmed reports of U.S. citizens killed or seriously injured in Japan. ""We know that many people are worried about the welfare of their friends and families who are here in Japan,"" he said. ""We understand also that some telephone landlines have been interrupted. Of course, we are recommending that people continue to contact loved ones here in Japan by e-mail, text, SMS message or social media."" On Friday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton offered ""immediate disaster relief assistance"" and added the United States is working closely with the Japanese government. Roos echoed those comments Saturday. The State Department on Friday issued an alert against nonessential travel to Japan. The alert also said strong aftershocks are likely ""for weeks"" and included instructions for what to do if caught in an earthquake or aftershock. Earlier, American Airlines told CNN that it would resume flights into Japan on Saturday. Both American and Delta Airlines canceled flights to Tokyo on Friday. It was unclear if flights to other Japanese airports also were affected. In addition, Delta, United and Continental airlines announced they were waiving change fees for people whose travel plans involving Japan were affected by the disaster. At the State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Janice Jacobs said a 24-hour consular task force has been set up to help Americans affected by the earthquake. Americans in Japan who need help, or people seeking information about a loved one in Japan, can send an e-mail to japanemergencyusc@state.gov, Jacobs said. Americans outside Japan but in tsunami-affected areas who need help, or people seeking information about an American in affected areas outside Japan, can e-mail pacifictsunamiusc@state.gov, she said. A telephone information line also has been set up at 1-888-407-4747, said Jacobs, who encouraged people to use the e-mail options if possible. When seeking information about Americans in Japan or other affected areas, Jacobs said, people should provide the full name, birth date and location of the person, as well as any pre-existing medical conditions, and if they are elderly or a child.

"Stephanie Mayweather is out of answers. Standing outside a corner market in crime-ridden North Philadelphia, she throws her arms up in desperation. ""I've been here for 13 years and I have watched the crime escalate, I have watched the neighborhood deteriorate. I have watched the police presence decline here. I don't know what the answer is,"" said Mayweather, executive director of East Division Crime Victim Services. Behind her, stuffed teddy bears, balloons and flowers mark the spot where the store's clerk, Rosemary ""Reyna"" Fernandez-Rivera, was gunned down on January 23 because, police say, she witnessed a murder at the same spot the day after Thanksgiving. ""This is a vicious cycle,"" Mayweather said. Out of the nation's 10 largest cities, Philadelphia's homicide rate is the worst.  Last year ended with 324 homicides, up from 306 in 2010. And just one month into this year, there has been on average more than one homicide each day in Philadelphia, with many of the 34 deaths unfolding like episodes on ""Law & Order."" A man ambushed a car packed with teens -- killing three of them -- for feuding with his stepsons. A pizza delivery man was shot in the back during a robbery. Another man was beaten to death hailing a cab on a busy downtown street. Then there was the retribution killing of Fernandez-Rivera, the store clerk and alleged murder witness. Aside from the murders, there have been ruthless beatings. On January 2, an off-duty police officer and Iraq war veteran was punched and kicked until he was unconscious outside a landmark restaurant after the Winter Classic hockey game. A couple of weeks later, a 64-year-old Vietnam veteran on his way to meet his wife at the bus stop was  attacked and robbed by two teens. ""I think folks are desperate. I think they're desperate and come from a culture where they learn the way to handle an argument is with a gun,"" said Chuck Williams, director of the Center for the Prevention of School-Aged Violence at Drexel University. Williams, an education professor at Drexel University, works with educators and youth to prevent school fights, shootings and cyberbullying. ""Although the streets don't offer anything positive, to a lot of the young people, a lot of the boys, the young black men, (the streets are) consistent,"" he said.  ""They know where they stand (on the streets)."" Philadelphia's mayor has made it clear  the city is waging an all-out war against violent criminals. ""If you want to act like an idiot, if you want to be an a-hole, if you want to be a low-life in this town, we will track you down like the dog that you are,"" Mayor Michael Nutter told CNN affiliate KYW last month. At the end of January, city officials unveiled new crimefighting measures, including a reward of $20,000 for information solving a homicide and $500 for locating illegal guns, plus funding for the witness assistance program and increasing police presence. At the news conference announcing the measures, Nutter put it this way: ""To every criminal out there: I just put a $20,000 bounty on your head."" A violent trend . City officials say it's too early to determine whether Philadelphia's homicide rate will continue to rise this year.  Last year, as the city was besieged by teen mob attacks, Nutter made it clear  he would not tolerate the violence. He raised some eyebrows last summer when he took to the pulpit to call out the predominantly black youths involved in the attacks. ""You damage yourself, you damage another person, you damage your peers, and quite honestly, you damage your own race,"" said Nutter, who is black and has two children. In an attempt to stop the mob violence, Nutter moved up the weekend curfews for teens in two Philadelphia neighborhoods that bore the brunt of the seemingly random attacks. ""There is no excuse for young people being out so late at night by themselves and then making bad decisions and literally assaulting other citizens,"" Nutter said. ""I will not tolerate that."" Philadelphia may have the worst homicide rate of the country's most populated cities, according to the most recent complete data (see fact box on left), but it pales in comparison with less-populated U.S. cities. Based on statistics from 2010, Philadelphia's homicide rate is about 20 killings per 100,000 people, according to FBI statistics. By comparison, cities with smaller populations have murder rates far worse than Philadelphia, including New Orleans at 49.1, St. Louis at 40.5 and Baltimore at 34.8. Criminal justice professor Jerry Ratcliffe says it's important to put Philadelphia's homicide data into a broader perspective. ""Nobody likes to have these homicide statistics,"" said Ratcliffe, director of the Center for Security and Crime Science at Temple University.  ""You're talking about 34 homicides. That's in a city of 1.5 million people."" While the daily body count is a disturbing trend for the city and triggers rampant media coverage, it doesn't mean Philadelphia is on track to become the murder capital of the country, Ratcliffe said. ""I don't want to belittle the numbers, but it's really too difficult to assess the safety of the entire city based on little over a month of data,"" he said. ""The real test will be this spring or summer when we (normally) see the violence peak."" Sending a message . This year, most of the city's homicides have been confined to North Philadelphia, including the Kensington neighborhood, where Fernandez-Rivera was gunned down inside her store and where Stephanie Mayweather's nonprofit victims' support unit operates. She said violence is now part of the fabric of the neighborhood and is as commonplace as a passing city bus. ""They're committing crimes in broad daylight. These crimes are heinous because they put the fear of God in these communities,"" she said. ""This homicide sent a strong message in this community. If you see something, don't say anything, because this could be you."" Mayweather said her East Division Crime Victim Services has helped more than 420 victims of violent crime since November, with several free services including court accompaniment and crime victim's compensation assistance, as well as short- and long-term counseling to victims of violent crimes ranging from shootings to rape. Mayweather's building, a renovated former drug house now riddled with bullet holes, is one block away from the Caribe Mini Market where Fernandez-Rivera was killed. It also sits around the corner from where the infamous ""Kensington Strangler,"" responsible for at least three homicides, was apprehended last year. Mayweather said she believes the situation in Kensington has worsened after a nearby police precinct closed in recent years. ""Some days, I'm afraid,"" she said. ""But if all of the social services ran out of this community out of fear, who would be here?"" 'There's still killing every day' The city's daily violence has news outlets once again branding the city ""Kill-adelphia."" Public safety advocate Anthony Murphy said the moniker is unfair. He urged critics to ""look beyond the body count."" ""We aren't all going out shooting each other randomly. Things have happened, yes. There's a challenge, yes. But Kill-adelphia? No. Should you be afraid to be in Philadelphia? No,"" said Murphy, executive director for Town Watch Integrated Services, an organization of volunteers who patrol neighborhoods. ""Police can't do everything. We have a responsibility to address the challenges in our community."" That responsibility, Murphy said, starts with establishing a positive foundation for youth, particularly when it comes to conflict resolution. Arguments are the leading motive for murder, and blacks make up nearly 84% of the homicide victims, according to police data. Stopping arguments from escalating to deadly violence is a priority at City Hall. ""Prevention (is) a key portion of what we're doing,"" said Everett Gillison, Nutter's chief of staff and deputy mayor for public safety.  ""But also just getting the community to act as one and come forward and say 'enough is enough. This stuff has got to stop.' "" Back in North Philadelphia, the gifts left behind in memory of Fernandez-Rivera join the collection of memorials honoring shooting victims across the neighborhood. At a recent prayer vigil, Lizasuain ""Mota"" DeJesus released a dole of doves in memory of the slain store clerk, whom she knew from her regular visits to the corner store. ""She was a really nice lady, very respectable,"" she said. ""I'm really in shock still that this has happened to her."" DeJesus is no stranger to violence. Her 5-year-old daughter, Iriana, was abducted, sexually assaulted, strangled and later found in an apartment building a block from her home in North Philadelphia. The alleged killer is one of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 10 most wanted fugitives. She said that while justice was served for Fernandez-Rivera through arrests for her slaying, she believes more needs to be done to stop the killing. ""I'm really disgusted with how every day you hear about a shooting, every day you hear somebody getting killed, every day something going on,"" DeJesus said. ""One death is too many, but a thousand of them is never enough (to have any effect). There's still killing every day.""","This January, there were 34 homicides in Philadelphia .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Fans of porn star Stormy Daniels are drafting her to run for the U.S. Senate seat in Louisiana now held by Republican Sen. David Vitter. And it's no racy gimmick, they say. Porn star Stormy Daniels, who has no party affiliation, says she's ""always up for a good fight."" The Draft Stormy Web site says that ""2010 presents the Pelican State with the opportunity to start with a clean slate -- to elect a representative that we can be proud of, who will work tirelessly, and who will challenge the status quo. We at the Draft Stormy campaign feel that Baton Rouge native Stormy Daniels is best suited to fulfill these duties."" Vitter is famous -- or infamous -- for his link to the ""D.C. Madam,"" the woman who ran a prostitution ring. Elected to the Senate in 2004, he admitted to ""a very serious sin in my past"" in July 2007 after his phone number turned up in records of an escort service run by the late Deborah Jeane Palfrey, known as the D.C. Madam. Running for re-election, Vitter said his wife has forgiven him and is banking on the same sentiment from his constituents. Will the Draft Stormy move mean stormy weather for Vitter? The senator's office didn't return calls by CNN. But a spokesman for the state GOP said voters ""are concerned with real issues that affect their everyday lives and not with political or publicity stunts."" The Draft Stormy campaign was started by New Orleans resident and Daniels fan Zack Hudson, who insists it's for real. Daniels, 29, isn't affiliated with a party but is embracing the idea of a possible candidacy.  Watch the adult entertainment star talk about a possible run » . She said she's planning a ""listening tour"" around Louisiana to talk about a range of matters, including the economy -- which along with women in business and protection of children are the three issues listed on her Web site. When told Vitter can be a tough opponent, she said she's ""always up for a good fight."" ""I think anyone that knows me ... is more than aware of that,"" Daniels said. ""Politics can't be any dirtier of a job than the one I am already in."" According to a capsule bio on the Draft Stormy Web site, Daniels has been ""breaking barriers and shattering glass ceilings her entire life,"" serving as editor of her high school newspaper and president of her school's 4-H Club and eventually transferring ""her determination and talents to the professional level, becoming a featured performer in the adult entertainment industry."" Another stride was ""signing an exclusive contract with the video production company Wicked Pictures, a company committed to a health and safety first policy, as pertaining to its video performances. Stormy's decision to sign with Wicked highlighted her commitment to sending a positive message to young people of the importance of practicing safe sex,"" the bio said. Daniels has directed films for the company, won awards for writing, directing and acting, and has appeared in mainstream films such as ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" ""Originally, the focus wasn't even about making me as a candidate,"" Daniels said. ""I think it was about bringing attention to the Senate race in general. Then the response was overwhelmingly positive. And I think everyone is just running with it."" While her political aspirations may be a light diversion for Louisiana voters, reality will set in if Daniels tangles with Vitter. Clancy DuBos, political director of the New Orleans alternative newspaper Gambit, said Vitter is a brilliant politician with a campaign war chest worth $2 million. If the Daniels campaign is meant to remind voters of Vitter's D.C. Madam link, the move could backfire, DuBos said. ""You are going to need someone better than a porn star, or a lap dancer, or a sex worker to nail David Vitter on this,"" he said. ""You need a serious opponent who is himself, or herself, not guilty of something like that to say, 'Let's talk about family values, shall we?' "" The Draft Stormy movement said Daniels' ""real world experience and special understanding of the economic hardships facing Louisianans and Americans make her uniquely qualified to take on the tough challenges we face. ""Our grass-roots movement spans the political spectrum and champions Stormy's philosophy of personal responsibility and the promotion of individual enterprise. We eschew partisanship and labels, instead judging our leaders on their integrity, character and effectiveness.""

"(CNN) -- Argentina are set to get more competitive rugby matches after it was confirmed they will join an expanded Tri-Nations series from 2012. Argentina are set to join an expanded Tri-Nations tournament which is scheduled to start in 2012. The International Rugby Board (IRB) have made a commitment to Argentina to provide them with more international fixtures to help fully integrate the Puma's into the international playing calendar. It is proposed that Argentina, bronze medalists at the 2007  World Cup, will join Australia, New Zealand and South Africa to create a new Four-Nation tournament. The proposed format will see the four teams playing on a home and away basis meaning six matches per team and 12 matches overall. The tournament would be played from mid-August for an eight or nine week period through until early to mid-October. In a Rugby World Cup year an abbreviated format would be played through July and August. Former Argentina captain Agustin Pichot admitted the decision well help to provide the impetus for participation growth within Argentina. ""I can't express the joy of what this means for me and the whole team at the Union Argentina de Rugby who have been working on this important project,"" he told the IRB official Web site. ""We are delighted to now get the chance to become a great Rugby nation with the chance to play top level international Rugby on an annual basis.

"A Republican lawmaker demanded Wednesday to know why investigators have not captured or killed any of the suspects in the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, pointing out that CNN was able to find a man who some say was the ringleader in the assault that left the ambassador and three other Americans dead. Eight GOP lawmakers are asking that incoming FBI Director James Comey brief Congress within 30 days about the investigation. They say the administration's inquiry into the September 11, 2012, attacks in Libya has been ""simply unacceptable,"" according to a draft letter obtained by CNN. ""One of the pertinent questions today is why we have not captured or killed the terrorist who committed these attacks?"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told reporters. ""News out today that CNN was able to go in and talk to one of the suspected terrorists, how come the military hasn't been able to get after them and capture or kill the people? How come the FBI isn't doing this and yet CNN is?"" Chaffetz was referring to CNN's recent interview with Ahmed Abu Khattala, who Libyan and U.S. officials have described as the Benghazi leader of the al Qaeda-affiliated militia group Ansar al-Sharia -- one of many groups that filled the vacuum of authority following the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi. He has been described as a ""person of interest"" in the investigation, according to officials. In that interview, Khattala told CNN's Arwa Damon that he had not been contacted by any Libyan or American officials. House panel subpoenas State Department over Benghazi . ""Even the investigative team did not try to contact me,"" he told Damon, referring to the FBI. When asked whether he would be willing to meet with investigators if they asked, Khattala said: ""Yes, no problem. ...But not as an interrogation, as a conversation like the one we are having right now."" Damon spent two hours interviewing Khattala at a coffee shop at a well-known hotel in Benghazi, describing his demeanor as fairly relaxed. He allowed Damon to use an audio recorder to tape the conversation, but refused to appear on camera. Khattala's narrative of the events that night was sometimes unclear and, at times, seemed to be contradictory, Damon said. He admitted to being at the compound the night of the attack, but denied any involvement in the violence. When he arrived at the perimeter of the compound, Khattala said he saw men carrying RPGs and medium guns, but that gunfire prevented him from getting close and entering the compound. Opinion: Benghazi blame game is useless . Khattala said by the time he managed to get inside the compound, everyone had withdrawn. He said he did not see any fires. Asked about allegations he may have masterminded the attack, Khattala and two of the men he brought with him to the interview ""burst out laughing,"" Damon said. Khattala does not appear to be a man who is in hiding, having granted interviews to The New York Times, Reuters and other news agencies in the weeks following the Benghazi attack. ""Rumors continue to swirl about the whereabouts of suspects involved in the attack,"" the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Comey, who will replace Robert Mueller as FBI director in September. ""The FBI continues to add pictures of potential assailants to its website and asks the Libyan people to assist with identifying the alleged perpetrators. We struggle to understand why we don't know more about those who attacked two U.S. compounds and murdered four brave Americans. "" The FBI did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment on the letter. The letter was initiated by Chaffetz and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, two of the fiercest critics of the administration's Benghazi response. Others who agreed to sign the letter included Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. On the House side, Darrell Issa, the chairman of the committee leading the House Benghazi investigation, Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio signed the letter. In the letter, the lawmakers wrote: ""We encourage you to be aggressive in your investigation to properly hold accountable those who attacked our compounds in Benghazi. We owe the families of those killed, and the people of this nation, answers to who was responsible and ensure they are held accountable."" The attack at the Benghazi diplomatic compound has become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the administration and Republicans, who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack, of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the November election. White House releases Benghazi e-mails . The GOP suggests the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to an explanation advanced by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice in television appearances -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Muslim film that was produced in the United States. The White House and its allies in Congress have said any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the assault stemmed from the ""fog of war,"" not any deliberate effort to mislead the public.","Rep.

"The worst outbreak of Ebola, which has killed 961 people and triggered an international public health emergency, may have started with a 2-year-old patient in a village in Guinea. About eight months ago, the toddler, whom researchers believe may have been Patient Zero, suffered fever, black stool and vomiting. Just four days after showing the painful symptoms, the child died on December 6, 2013, according to a report published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Scientists don't know exactly how the toddler contracted the virus. Ebola is spread from animals to humans through infected fluids or tissue, according to the World Health Organization. ""In Africa, infection has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines,"" WHO says, though researchers think fruit bats are what they call the virus's ""natural host."" Researchers who published the paper this year found a chain of illnesses in the toddler's family. After the child's death, the mother suffered bleeding symptoms and died on December 13, according to the report. Then, the toddler's 3-year-old sister died on December 29, with symptoms including fever, vomiting and black diarrhea. The illness subsequently affected the toddler's grandmother, who died on January 1, in the family's village of Meliandou in Guéckédou. The area in southern Guinea is close to the Sierra Leone and Liberia borders. The illness spread outside their village after several people attended the grandmother's funeral. Funerals tend to bring people in close contact with the body. Ebola spreads from person to person through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. It has no known cure. Two of the funeral attendees appeared to bring back the virus to their village, and it spread to health care workers and other family members who took care of infected patients. ""A health care worker from Guéckédou with suspected disease, seems to have triggered the spread of the virus to Macenta, Nzérékoré, and Kissidougou in February 2014,"" stated the report, noting that more Guinea towns were affected. Clusters of the disease popped up in early 2014 in these areas, with the initial patients suffering fever, vomiting and severe diarrhea, according to the report. Hemorrhaging was less frequent, the report noted. In early March, the Ministry of Health in Guinea and Doctors Without Borders in Guinea were notified about the disease clusters. Health investigators arrived that month and began tracing the disease by examining hospital documents and conducting interviews with affected families and villagers. Ebola has now spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, prompting global concerns.

"Kemba Smith Pradia voted for the first time in her life in Indianapolis city elections last fall. This year, she moved from Indiana to Virginia, a few months ahead of the November presidential election, in which she'd very much like to cast her ballot. But she can't.  Pradia is a former felon, and in Virginia, people convicted of violent felonies, drug crimes, and certain other offenses must wait for five years before even applying for a gubernatorial restoration of voting rights.  That's five years after serving your sentence, finishing supervised probation and paying all fines and restitution.  And those five years have to be clean -- no misdemeanors or pending convictions, or the application is void. Such laws -- which exist in various forms in 11 other states besides Virginia -- mean that an estimated 5.8 million people do not have the right to vote, according to ProCon.org, a non-partisan group that researches and tracks controversial issues. The NAACP launched a nationwide campaign Tuesday to restore voting rights for ex-felons, saying that state efforts to block such rights are thinly veiled attempts to suppress the black vote. NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Jealous  kicked off the campaign in Florida, which has the highest level of disenfranchisement in the country. ""What this comes down to really is, do you think voting is a right or is it a privilege?  Because if voting is a right, people who have paid their debt to society should be allowed to vote,"" Jealous said earlier Tuesday on ""CNN Newsroom."" In 2007, then-Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, a Republican at the time, signed reforms to allow former felons who'd completed their sentences to more easily get their voting rights restored.  Four years later, Republican Gov. Rick Scott reversed those reforms, imposing a five- to seven-year waiting period and a complicated application process to get civil rights restored. In issuing the new rules for voting rights for ex-felons, Scott said the changes ""are intended to emphasize public safety and ensure that all applicants desire clemency, deserve clemency, and demonstrate they are unlikely to reoffend."" ""It stands to reason that individuals who have committed serious violence or sexual offenses; abused the privilege of holding public office; endangered society with poisonous drugs; or carried a firearm after they have been convicted should be required to attend a hearing and explain why their rights should be restored,"" Scott said in a statement in March of 2011. According to a study of state data by the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times, 7,000 people were removed from Florida's voter rolls in the first four months of this year for recent felony convictions.  Among those removed, 51% are Democrats and 17% are Republicans. Nationally, 38% of the people disenfrachised due to felony convictions are African-American, according to the Sentencing Project.  The American Civil Liberties Union said Florida has the nation's largest share of disenfranchised voters, where nearly one out of every five black men overall is ineligible to vote. Every vote counts in Florida, a heavily contested battleground in the 2012 elections and the pivotal player in the result of the 2000 elections, which was decided by 537 votes in favor of George Bush. Another swing state crucial to the elections this year is Virginia, where former felons who have served their sentences and paid all fines and restitution must wait ""a minimum of two years for a non-violent offense or five years for a violent felony or drug distribution, drug manufacturing offense, any crimes against a minor, or an election law offense"" before applying to have their voting rights restored. Pradia was sentenced to 24 years in prison in 1994 for a crack cocaine conviction that she says was the result of her abusive relationship with a drug dealer.  In 2000, then-President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence to time served. But that wasn't the end of her punishment. ""One of the collateral consequences of having been incarcerated is losing my right to vote,"" she told a United Nations Human Rights Council panel in Geneva last week.  An NAACP delegation urged the U.N.'s special rapporteur on racism to investigate what it said were racially discriminatory election laws in the United States. Not being able to vote ""makes one feel inferior,"" Pradia told CNN Tuesday. ""You don't want people that are trying to reintegrate, trying to live a better lifestyle, to feel this way,"" she added.  ""It's hard for me to be able to explain to my children why I'm not able to vote when I pay taxes, and they see me working hard and doing things I should be doing as a citizen."" Pradia said she applied in August for her voting rights to be restored in Virginia.  She has not yet received a response to her request.","Pradia was convicted of a first-time, non-violent drug offense in Virginia in 1992 .
The NAACP says state efforts to block ex-felons from voting is discriminatory .
Florida has one of the toughest processes to restore former felons' voting rights ."
"The North Korean government is fuming over the release of the ""The Interview,"" claiming President Barack Obama forced the film into theaters and onto streaming video services. ""U.S. President Obama is the chief culprit who forced the Sony Pictures Entertainment to 'indiscriminately distribute' the movie and took the lead in appeasing and blackmailing cinema houses and theatres in the U.S. mainland to distribute the movie,"" North Korea's National Defense Commission said Saturday, according to state-run media. ""Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest."" In the screwball comedy, a tabloid journalist who is granted an interview with North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un is asked to assassinate him. But when he arrives, the movie version of the dictator charms him. Later on, however, the two wage battle. 'Inescapable deadly blows' Just getting ""The Interview"" into theaters and online streams has been an ordeal. Sony Pictures had initially suspended the Christmas release of the movie after its IT systems were hacked by a group called the ""Guardians of Peace,"" which had complained about the movie's pending release. The group also warned of severe attacks on movie theaters showing the film. In the cyberattack, thieves took a possible record haul of 100 terabytes of data -- a slew of movies and other content, company secrets, personal information of employees and the Social Security numbers of celebrities. The FBI has blamed North Korea for that cyberattack. North Korea, in turn, slammed the United States for the accusation. ""If the U.S. is to persistently insist that the hacking attack was made by the DPRK, the U.S. should produce evidence without fail, though belatedly,"" said the North Korean Defense Commission statement carried Saturday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. ""If the U.S. persists in American-style arrogant, high-handed and gangster-like arbitrary practices despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the U.S. should bear in mind that its failed political affairs will face inescapable deadly blows."" U.S. accused over North Korean outage . Pyongyang's statement also accused the United States of being behind the crippling outage of North Korea's Internet last week. ""The U.S., a big country, started disturbing the internet operation of major media of the DPRK,"" it said. The U.S. government last week declined to say whether it was responsible for the Internet disruption in North Korea. Obama had earlier warned the United States would ""respond proportionally"" to the Sony hack. Obama had also expressed disappointment at the movie's suspension, saying free speech had been stifled. ""We cannot have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States because if somebody is able to intimidate us out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they don't like or news reports that they don't like,"" Obama said last week. ""That's not who we are. That's not what America is about."" Who's behind the Sony cyberattack . The FBI has said that the code of the malware used in the attack on Sony is similar to what North Korea has used in other attacks. But that code was leaked a long time ago, cyberexperts say, and any hacker around the world could have used it. Some U.S. cyberexperts say the evidence the FBI has presented isn't enough to isolate North Korea as the culprit. ""It's clear to us, based on both forensic and other evidence we've collected, that unequivocally they are not responsible for orchestrating or initiating the attack on Sony,"" said Sam Glines, who runs cybersecurity company Norse. CNN has reached out to the FBI for comment on such doubt, but has not heard back. $1 million in one day . After Sony Pictures said film distributors had decided not to show ""The Interview"" for security reasons, Sony then arranged for direct distribution online via its own services, YouTube and through independent cinemas. A few hundred movie theaters decided to go ahead and show the film on Christmas. Sony had originally planned to release the movie in 2,000 to 3,000 theaters, but only about 300 played it. Nonetheless, the film raked in $1 million on its first day. While there were threats of attacks on theaters that showed the film, no major incidents were reported.","North Korea claims Obama is the ""chief culprit"" who forced the distribution of the movie .

"Military convictions of two terror suspects will get a full federal appeals court review, testing whether the men could be charged with offenses that were not in place when Congress passed a 2006 anti-terror law. In an unusual move, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia announced Tuesday all seven of its judges would hear an appeal from two Muslim prisoners held for years at the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba. Most appeals of that type are heard by three-judge panels, which separately tossed out the convictions of accused al-Qaeda propagandist Ali Hamza al-Bahlul, and former Osama bin Laden driver Salim Ahmed Hamdan. The Obama administration then requested the full court to hear the case. Oral arguments will be held September 30. The losing party will almost certainly ask the U.S. Supreme Court to offer the final word. Both defendants were charged with providing material support to terrorism and conspiracy for al-Qaeda, around the time of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, offenses that were not included as crimes before the Military Commissions Act went into effect several years later. That law established the tribunal system used to try terror suspects held at Guantanamo, outside the civilian federal trial courts. The ex post facto provision of the Constitution says the government may not retroactively criminalize conduct that was either legal or not on the record when committed. The previous appeals panels concluded only pre-existing federal offenses and violations of the international law of war could be used to prosecute the men. Al-Bahlul and Hamdan are so far the only Guantanamo inmates convicted at the military tribunals. Five other men had separately pleaded guilty to offenses. Other cases, including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other so-called ""high-value detainees"" are still awaiting trial. Yemeni native al-Bahlul was convicted in November 2008 of conspiring with al-Qaeda, soliciting murder, and providing material support for terrorism. He was accused of making videos for the terror organization. His conviction was overturned in January, and he remains in Guantanamo custody. Hamdan was also tried in 2008, the first man convicted under the new tribunal system. Later that year he was transferred to Yemen to serve out the remainder of his sentence. He had admitted to being the driver of the now-deceased leader of al-Qaeda, and was the subject of a 2010 documentary, ""The Oath,"" chronicling his life and detention. He is no stranger to the federal courts. In a blow to executive authority, the Supreme Court in 2006 ruled the existing military commission system to originally detain and charge Hamdan was not adequate, and the justices said Congress needed to come up new constitutionally permissible rules. That decision prompted Congress to pass the Military Commissions Act and revise the tribunal system. The law also sought to limit federal court jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus challenges to detention, but judges have consistently said they do have the power to be involved. Ever since the 9/11 attacks, federal courts have been asked to determine if detainees had the right to contest their imprisonment and the rules set up to try them. The current appeals court case is al-Bahlul v. U.S (11-1324).","Full federal appeals court will hear case of two terror suspects charged around the time of 9/11 .
The men were convicted by a military court and held for years at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba .
Appeal tests whether men could be charged with offenses not on books until later .

"Four suspects have been questioned in Portugal in connection with the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a source close to the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. The suspects, all Portuguese, were questioned by Portuguese police, with the assistance of Scotland Yard, as London's Metropolitan Police are known. One of the suspects suffers from schizophrenia, one is a former taxi driver, and another was just 16 years old at the time of the girl's disappearance, the source said. Madeleine was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she vanished from her family's holiday apartment in the Portuguese resort town of Praia da Luz. Her parents had left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother raised the alarm when she checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing. According to the source, Scotland Yard is focusing on the four suspects because some of them made calls to one another the night of the girl's disappearance, as well as the night before and the night after. They had asked to search the suspects' homes, but were denied by courts that found no evidence to warrant such a search, the source said. Scotland Yard believes the four suspects called one another to plan a robbery, which went wrong when they saw the girl at the home. British police recently finished digging in an area of wasteland close to where Madeleine went missing in Portugal. They searched two areas, according to the source, and will be leaving Portugal in the next few days. In July 2013, Scotland Yard reopened its investigation into the little girl's disappearance after a two-year review of the original probe. Portuguese police reopened their investigation last October. At the time, the Metropolitan Police said the two police forces' investigations would run in parallel. Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, launched a massive publicity campaign to find their daughter after she went missing. They say they continue to believe she is still alive.","The suspects are Portuguese; one suffers from schizophrenia, a source says .

"India may have hosted its first Formula One grand prix in 2011, but the sport's future on the sub-continent could be bleak according to one senior official. Vicky Chandhok, president of the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India, is the father of Karun Chandhok, one of only two Indian drivers to have competed in F1. The other is Narain Karthikeyan, who is currently contracted to strugglers HRT. Chandhok told CNN that the increasing need for drivers to attract big-money sponsors has made it harder for talented youngsters to break through, especially with F1 battling to gain a foothold in India's sporting spectrum. Vettel takes championship lead after third straight win . ""After Narain and Karun, I really can't see an Indian driver for the next, I would say, eight to 10 years,"" Chandhok said ahead of this weekend's Indian Grand Prix. ""Formula One has become all about money ... it never was earlier, you could find a slot with just talent. ""The Formula One teams have decided that even if you've got talent, let's have your checkbook as well -- bring in five, 10, 20 million dollars and let's give you the seat."" According to Chandhok, it could take a figure such as legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar to spark genuine interest in F1 among India's 1.2 billion inhabitants. ""India needs heroes, India needs superheroes like Sachin Tendulkar,"" he said. ""Narain and Karun have certainly given the sport, or our sport at least in India, the slot that it desperately needed. Formula One has helped."" Massa handed new Ferrari contract . Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel won last year's inaugural race at the Buddh International Circuit, near New Delhi, but Chandhok fears interest in the event has dipped since then. ""There's been a massive drop in buzz, I don't know why,"" he said. ""After the first year, we had a sellout crowd in year one of 95,000 people, but year two there has been a dip. ""I think we will end up with 60,000 spectators in the stands ... (in India) nobody's used to be parked in long queues just waiting to get to a Formula One event, having to find passes -- it's a very sanitized atmosphere."" Despite Chandhok predicting a drop in attendance figures, MotorSport magazine's Ed Foster says 60,000 is still a sizable crowd compared to other dates on the F1 calendar. ""The first year you are always going to get a lot of spectators and a lot of interest,"" he told CNN. ""It needs to be put in perspective as well -- 60,000 spectators is a huge number of spectators. ""Places like South Korea didn't get half of that number. They might not have as many spectators as last year, but they have still got a hell of a lot more than many other race tracks."" The cheapest ticket for the track over the weekend is $61.53 in a country where there is widespread poverty. Foster said the prohibitive ticket prices are a direct result of the millions of dollars which must be paid to host an F1 grand prix. ""It's a problem all over the world,"" he said. ""You can't charge hundreds of pounds for a grandstand seat and then complain you haven't got enough spectators. ""The tickets prices are astronomical. The fees paid to host a grand prix are many millions, so in order to try and recoup some of those funds the tickets prices are high."" However, Chandhok hopes F1 can develop in India despite the challenges faced by its race organizers. ""I do hope that economically and financially it remains viable,"" he said. ""There is a contract between the GP group and Formula One until 2015. ""Beyond that I do hope that we can sustain it, and if not maybe F1 will start to change their approach to rights fees and things like that. ""It's very high at $40 million, it's very high for a country like us, but as we start using the facility that is built for it for other uses, like concerts, national events, I think it will be fantastic to try to make this with a really long-term plan. I gather it will work.""","Vicky Chandhok tells CNN it could be 10 years until India produces another F1 driver .

"While traveling in the Earth's orbit over 240 miles up, American astronaut Karen Nyberg joined Leading Women anchor Becky Anderson for a live interview from the International Space Station (ISS) Friday. When she's not working on scientific experiments, Nyberg can be found tweeting amazing pictures of the planet, chasing floating desserts in space and knitting. Read on for the full interview. CNN: Station, this is CNN. How do you hear me? Karen Nyberg: Good Morning CNN. This is station. I have you loud and clear. CNN: Simeon Birchall, a CNN.com commenter asks is there huge competition for every seat on a shuttle launch? KN: Well I don't know if I'd say competition. Definitely everybody that is in the astronaut office that wants to fly is very eager to do so even if they have gone before. Generally it's kind of going in order of when a class is selected, they start flying people from that class. And then it depends on what roles are needed. If we need to fly somebody that is going to be the commander of the space station, frequently most often that is somebody who has experience flying; if we need somebody who is going to be doing space walks, we need somebody that can do that. Back when we were flying the shuttle, there were a lot more specific tasks doing robotics ops and the space walks. TIMELINE: 50 years of women in space . Now on the space station everybody pretty much has to do everything and so it's a little competitive I guess, but your turn comes along. CNN: @Alizabev asks what type of experiments are you working on? KN: This week we've been doing a lot of experiments on our ocular health. We've noticed some problems over the past several years with many of our astronauts. They come back to Earth after three to six months in space and have long term vision problems, changes in their vision. We are trying to figure out what exactly is causing that. Luca (Parmitano) and I have been involved in numerous tests. We're doing tonometry -- we are looking at the pressure of the eye. We are doing ultrasounds to look at the morphology of the eye, we are doing fundoscopy to take images of the retina, vision tests. We are hoping that we can determine exactly what is causing this and hopefully mitigate the problem, especially if we start longer duration missions going to Mars ... we really need to understand this so we don't degrade the vision of every astronaut that is going into space. CNN: A commenter on CNN.com Marik asks what do you think of the Mars One project which aims to privately settle people on the planet? KN: I think it would be interesting. I think there are a lot of challenges and a lot of things that need to be figured out before that can be a successful mission. Mars is a long ways away and we have a lot to learn ... I don't know how many years from now that will be, but that type of thing may become standard. CNN: Floyd Moore aged 5 and Camper Carl of @AZChallenger both asked the same question: What is it like to sleep in space? And have you ever floated out of your bed? KN: It's actually quite comfortable sleeping in space. We have sleeping bags that we hang from the wall. The first couple weeks when I was here, it was very important to me to feel like I was almost laying on something. I would lay with my legs sideways in the sleeping back so that I felt pressure along my back from one side of the sleeping bag and I felt pressure from my legs on the other side. Now I've become a little more adapted to it and I can just float there. And no, I've never floated out of the bed. I'm usually zipped in pretty well. CNN: @Womenintheair asks: Which female astronauts influenced you? And have you met any of them as an astronaut? KN: Sally Ride was making her first flight into space and she really impacted me. And also just looking back, I did some research on Valentina Tereshkova when I was in high school because she was the first female to fly in space. And I actually did meet her last year for a brief moment before traveling to Baikonur as a back up for one of the missions. It was just (a) fantastic opportunity to get to meet her. I never did meet Sally Ride. I met her sister after her passing but it would have been fantastic to meet her too. But I think those two, the firsts, those names stick in your head and they really become inspirations for you. CNN: @nmedia_s asks do you think there is intelligent life in space -- besides the people at the ISS? KN: I don't know. I don't think I'm smart enough to know. The universe is so big. It's hard to imagine that there isn't something out there that is similar to our solar system and could provide what the Earth provides for us. But certainly we haven't seen that and you know, maybe some day we will. It's hard for me to say whether I truly believe it or not. I think it's possible. I don't believe we've seen anything but it's possible there is life out there somewhere. CNN: @FumaiMartin asks how much physics and chemistry taught in high school helps at the International Space Station? KN: I think any type of scientific class or mathematical class or any class really that you take is helpful even if you don't use the specific fundamentals that you learn in that class. There is something about learning how to learn that I think is very important is a very broad spectrum. And the same for college, a lot of the classes you take you are like, you think to yourself 'I'm never going to use this.' And you know what, sometimes you don't ... But a lot of it you do use. Even though we are working directly with the investigators of the scientific experiments. It's important for us understand what's going on so we can help and maybe we can see things and we can help them with their discoveries. CNN: Greg Wagner on Facebook asks what one place on Earth would you most like to visit with only the knowledge of having seen it from the ISS? KN: Oh wow! You know there are so many beautiful places that I don't even know how I would answer that. I've seen some mountain ranges that are just absolutely incredible ... But at the same time, I've come along some coastlines that look just breathtaking and so I guess I would have a lot of traveling to do if I were to go to every single place that I thought looked like a great place to be. CNN: CNN Mexico commenter Luis Flores Gonzalez asks if you were offered the opportunity to take a one-way trip to the deepest part of the universe, would you accept it? KN: A one-way trip, no. Especially with the current situation I'm in with a young son and a husband at home. I definitely would not want to do a really long, and definitely a one-way trip. It might be a different story if I had family with me but I'd have to say no to that. CNN: @Fadhelindonesia asks when you read my message what continent are you looking at?

Time goes by so fast and in the weekdays and on the evenings, there's absolutely no time for that. Sundays is really my day and I actually got a few things out the other day and drew up a design on a piece of paper and cut up some old T shirts and have started sewing things together. Not quite sure exactly how it is going to turn out but ... when I find the time to sit there and do that only, hopefully I'll get something done.

"Prosecutors say he believed he had a duty to kill as many soldiers as possible. His lawyers say he is trying to help the prosecution put him to death. For his part, Army Maj. Nidal Hasan has said little during his death penalty trial, other than to say he was the shooter in the Fort Hood, Texas, rampage that left 13 people dead. With the prosecution expected to rest this week, the big question is whether the Army psychiatrist will take the stand, perhaps more eager to prove he is a martyr than to avoid a death sentence. Hasan is acting as his own attorney at his court-martial, defending himself against 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the November 5, 2009, attack. Hasan left no doubt about his role, telling a panel of 13 officers during a brief opening statement: ""The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter."" ""The evidence presented with this trial will show one side. The evidence will also show that I was on the wrong side. I then switched sides,"" he said. He's also left little question about why he did it, repeatedly saying before the trial started that he was acting to protect Taliban leaders in Afghanistan from the U.S. military. ""We mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion,"" he told the panel last week. But, Hasan added, ""I apologize for the mistakes I made in this endeavor."" Hasan, 42, has previously indicated that he intends to call himself and two witnesses to the stand. If he testifies, Hasan is expected to discuss religious justification for his actions. ""He is trying to become a martyr, trying to be executed for his crime,"" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin has said of Hasan's defense strategy, adding that it amounted to a ""form of suicide by judge."" Hasan refused to enter a plea at the outset of the court-martial after a judge barred him from pleading guilty. Under military law, defendants cannot enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases. Last week, Hasan released a portion of his mental health evaluation to The New York Times that revealed he believes that being put to death would allow him to become a martyr. ""I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life. However, if I died by lethal injection I would still be a martyr,"" Hasan told a military panel evaluating whether he was fit to stand trial, according to documents published by the Times. Hasan has been confined to a wheelchair since being shot by Fort Hood police. He is paralyzed from the chest down. The release of the documents, coupled with Hasan's lack of an appearance of a defense, prompted military attorneys ordered to act as his stand-by counsel to demand they be allowed to drop off of the case. The attorneys said they believe Hasan is trying to help the prosecution obtain a death sentence. The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, refused to grant the request, and the defense attorneys have since appealed her ruling. ""We believe your order is causing us to violate our professional ethics. It's morally repugnant to us as defense counsel,"" Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, head of Hasan's legal team, told the judge. A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, Hasan was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. But he had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military, saying he had been taunted by people after the September 11 terror attacks. Prosecutors hope to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a ""progressive radicalization,"" going so far as to give academic presentations in defense of suicide bombings. Hasan, who was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan, did not want to fight against other Muslims and believed ""that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,"" said lead prosecutor Col. Michael Mulligan. Investigations following the shooting rampage found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S. born cleric who officials say became a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He was killed in U.S. drone strike in 2011. The prosecution has sought to enter the communications with al-Awlaki into evidence as well as materials about Hasan's alleged interest in the action of Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar, a U.S. soldier who was sentenced to death for killing two soldiers in a grenade attack in Kuwait at the start of the invasion of Iraq. While the judge deferred a decision on the requests, she has ruled that prosecutors may use evidence of Hasan's Internet searches on jihad and the Taliban in the days and hours before the attack. Fort Hood victims: Sons, a daughter, a mother-to-be . Hasan has listened impassively as survivors and investigators have testified, painting a horrific picture of what unfolded during the shooting inside the Soldier Readiness Processing Center as soldiers and civilians prepared to leave for Afghanistan and Iraq. Dozens of witnesses, primarily soldiers, testified that Hasan specifically targeted uniformed personnel. Army Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford, the first survivor to take the stand, recounted how the gunman rose from a chair in the processing center, shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" -- Arabic for God is great, pulled out a pistol and began shooting. ""It was a state of panic,"" Lunsford said. As Lunsford was checking behind him, ""Major Hasan is turning the weapon on me,"" he said. ""He has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and I blink. In that time, he discharges his weapon. The first round, I'm hit in the head."" A second shot caught Lunsford in the back. He decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door. He made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside, he testified. Capt. Dorothy Ellen Carskadon, who was her final checkup ahead of her deployment, testified that she initially believed the shooting was part of a military exercise. Then he heard Pvt. Francheska Velez screaming, ""my baby, my baby"" as she cradled her stomach. She crawled to the pregnant Velez and tried to comfort her, telling the 21-year-old private that it would be OK and that the training exercise would end soon. Velez and her unborn baby died in the attack. Carskadon told the court she suffered four gunshot wounds: one that grazed her head; another through her right hip; a third lodged in her right leg; and a fourth in the abdomen. Chief Warrant Officer Christopher Royal, 41, stared down at Hasan from the stand, where he testified how he charged the gunman to try to stop him and how Hasan shot him. Days before he took the stand, Royal told CNN that he had forgiven Hasan. ""I can't hold that grudge,"" Royal said. ""It's just too much. I won't allow him to consume any more energy for my life than he has already done, and so I have released him. ""I have forgiven him completely,"" he said. ""It's not up to me to punish him. His punishment will come.""","Maj. Nidal Hasan is charged with 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama warned Tuesday of ""difficult days ahead"" for Egypt and said the transition following President Hosni Mubarak's earlier announcement that he won't run for re-election in September must begin immediately. In a brief statement to reporters at the White House, Obama pledged continuing U.S. support for both a longtime ally and the aspirations of protesting Egyptians, whose eight days of growing demonstrations led to Mubarak's dramatic announcement on state television. ""We've borne witness to the beginning of a new chapter in the history of a great country and a long-time partner of the United States,"" Obama said of the Mubarak statement less than three hours earlier. Noting that he and Mubarak had just spoken by phone, Obama said Mubarak ""recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and a change must take place."" Repeating earlier calls for an orderly transition in Egypt from Mubarak's nearly three decades of repressive rule to a fully representative democracy, Obama said the transition ""must be meaningful, it must be peaceful and it must begin now."" ""Furthermore, the process must include a broad spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties,"" Obama said. ""It should lead to elections that are free and fair. And it should result in a government that's not only grounded in democratic principles but is also responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people."" Earlier, sources told CNN that a U.S. envoy sent by Obama urged Mubarak to announce he won't run for re-election later this year, a major shift in foreign policy regarding the main Arab ally of the United States and a vital partner in the Middle East peace process because of its 1978 treaty with Israel. According to the sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified by name, former U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Frank Wisner conveyed the message to Mubarak in Egypt. It was unclear if the meeting was Monday or Tuesday. Until now, the street demonstrations in Egypt demanding Mubarak's ouster had drawn a measured U.S. response that advocated step-by-step reforms for pro-democracy changes while maintaining stability. This week, though, calls increased for the Obama administration to push for Mubarak to step aside immediately or announce he would not be a candidate in the next presidential election scheduled for September. One of Egypt's leading opposition figures, Mohamed ElBaradei, warned Monday that the United States needed to ""let go"" of its longtime ally. ""You shouldn't be behind the curve, and you need to start building confidence with the people and not with the people who are smothering the people,"" ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" The unrest in Egypt presented Obama with a complex issue that lacked easy answers. Egypt -- the main Arab ally of the United States -- is inexorably linked to neighboring Israel -- the main U.S. ally in the Middle East -- by a peace treaty that guarantees more than $1 billion a year in U.S. military aid to Mubarak's government. Egypt also provides vital logistical and intelligence assistance to the United States, which has urged Mubarak for years to implement democratic reforms but always put the strategic benefits first. Daniel Kurtzer, the U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 1997 to 2001, said the administration wants to both support ""an exceedingly strong ally"" and promote democratic reform and more openness in ""a closed authoritarian society."" ""The United States is trying to find comfortable ground in which we can argue for both without abandoning an ally and without abandoning our principles,"" Kurtzer told CNN on Monday. Egypt's turmoil follows years of social, political and economic grievances that fueled the street protests that began last week and have since escalated. After ruling with an iron fist for three decades, Mubarak had given no indication of giving up power before his statement Tuesday night. However, ElBaradei and other opposition figures immediately condemned Mubarak's announcement as insufficient, saying the president needed to step aside immediately for a caretaker government of national unity to lead Egypt until new presidential and parliamentary elections can be held. Obama's statement avoided addressing the opposition demands, instead promising the demonstrators -- particularly young Egyptians looking to the United States for support and leadership -- that America supported their aspirations. ""We hear your voices,"" Obama said. ""I have an unyielding belief that you will determine your own destiny and seize the promise of a better future for your children and your grandchildren. And I say that as someone who is committed to a partnership between the United States and Egypt. ""There will be difficult days ahead,"" Obama continued. ""Many questions about Egypt's future remain unanswered, but I am confident that the people of Egypt will find those answers."" In the past week, demonstrators in Egypt have questioned why Obama, who championed human rights and democracy in a 2009 speech in Cairo, wasn't condemning Mubarak and applying pressure to help bring the changes they seek. ElBaradei, who returned to his native Egypt last week as an opposition figure last week, said Egyptians need to see that the United States is supporting their aspirations. ""People need to see that you not only talk the talk, but walk the walk, and people need to understand and believe that you really, seriously take democracy, rule of law, freedoms seriously,"" ElBaradei said Sunday. Asking ""a dictator"" to implement democratic reforms ""is an oxymoron, frankly."" On Monday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Egypt's government should engage in ""meaningful negotiations with a broad section of civil society, including opposition groups,"" and hold ""free and fair elections"" in September. The transition called for by the United States ""means change, and what we've advocated from the very beginning is that the way Egypt looks and operates must change,"" Gibbs told reporters. At the same time, he said it is not the place of the United States to support or oppose the possible ouster of Mubarak. Some U.S. politicians disagreed. One of the U.S. Senate's most influential foreign policy voices, Democrat John Kerry of Massachusetts, called Tuesday for Mubarak to step down, reflecting the rapidly changing consensus among top Washington policymakers. Kerry, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, also said Mubarak's son, Gamal, should not take the reins of power in Cairo. The U.S. government needs to start paying closer attention to the ""genuine political, legal and economic needs"" of people in the Middle East, as opposed to consistently supporting friendly governments regardless of their domestic politics, Kerry said in an op-ed commentary published by the New York Times. ""For three decades, the United States pursued a Mubarak policy,"" he wrote. ""Now we must look beyond the Mubarak era and devise an Egyptian policy."" To Marina Ottaway, director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the unrest in Egypt showed that the U.S. policy of backing Mubarak despite his poor record on political and human rights has failed to bring desired stability. Instead of what she labeled ""subtle"" language such as endorsing an orderly transition, the United States should call for a government of national unity to take over until fully democratic elections for both the presidency and the parliament, Ottaway told CNN on Monday.

"The Turkish government banned YouTube on Thursday, less than a week after Ankara made a similar blackout of the social networking site Twitter, which is estimated to have more than 10 million Turkish users. Neither website can be reached on Turkish Internet networks. The crackdown comes just days before Turks are expected to go to the polls in nationwide municipal elections. The Turkish government said its YouTube block came as a response to the leak of a conversation between top government officials purportedly discussing the possibility of going to war with neighboring Syria. Turkey's top media regulating agency announced a similar ban on the broadcast of the conversation to television and radio channels. ""It is seen as appropriate that a temporary broadcast ban be implemented on the voice recordings on social media and alleged to be between the foreign minister, the head of the National Intelligence Agency and military officials,""  the Radio and Television Supreme Council -- Turkey's chief media regulating agency -- announced on its website. Turkey's political elite has been battered by a campaign of wiretap leaks recorded by unknown operatives and distributed daily for more than a month on the Internet. Until Wednesday, all of the wiretaps seemed to be recordings of phone conversations between Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his inner circle, government officials and some top corporate executives. Erdogan has called some recordings ""immorally edited material,"" including a conversation in which a man who sounds like the Prime Minister purportedly instructs his son to hide tens of millions of dollars in cash from police investigators. But he has also confirmed the authenticity of other wiretaps, in which he is heard instructing the head of a major television news network to cut short the live broadcast of a rival politician's speech in Parliament. Turkey's government has accused social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, of being used to spread false information and lies since the leaked, high-level conversations from inside the current government have spread online. ""We're seeing reports that some users are not able to access YouTube in Turkey. There is no technical issue on our side and we're looking into the situation,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. YouTube is owned by Google. Unlike previously leaked recordings -- which all sounded like telephone conversations -- the recording released on Wednesday sounds like audio coming from a microphone planted in a room where a meeting is being held. Male Turkish voices can be heard discussing whether to send troops into neighboring Syria, where Turkey has supported rebels against the government in Damascus during a conflict that has lasted more than three years. ""Monitoring such a meeting of a highly confidential nature which was held at a location such as the office of the Foreign Minister, where the most sensitive security issues of the State are discussed and releasing these conversations to the public are a despicable attack, an act of espionage and a very serious crime against the national security of Turkey,"" announced Turkey's Foreign Ministry in a statement on Thursday. The recording suggests a major security breach within the halls of the country's Foreign Ministry. The bans on Twitter and YouTube may be followed by a broader crackdown on the Internet. An official at Turkey's prime ministry, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN, ""If there are recordings similarly threatening to national security, there can be similar precautions taken on other social media."" This week a Turkish court overruled the government's ban of Twitter, but the website is still blocked.  According to legal procedures, Turkish authorities have 30 days to implement the court injunction.","Turkish authorities have blocked YouTube days after banning Twitter .

"Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- A dried-out swimming pool, 300 empty rooms and destroyed elevators. The Ducor Palace Hotel, once the most exclusive hotel in Liberia, is now just a shadow of its former splendor. But the floors still have marble and the view over the capital Monrovia is worth climbing the 15 flights of stairs. There are many bullet riddled and bombed out buildings like the Ducor Hotel in Liberia. They are grim reminders of the brutal 14-year civil war that devastated the West African country and killed an estimated 250,000 people. The past decade of peace has stabilized the political situation as well as generated government revenues from the mining sector. Read this: Liberia: From warzone to holiday paradise? But there is one small business in particular that has prospered into a big industry: motorcycle taxis. The end of the civil war in 2003 created an increased demand for affordable transport. Former combatants, many of whom had been child soldiers, were quick to react to the demand. They started offering uncomplicated transport on motorcycles. ""Every young man needed a job and these are the only means of employment in this country now,"" says Monrovian motorcycle driver Harris Culey. Flourishing business . Liberia's Ministry of Transport estimates that there were around 500,000 drivers in the country, as of 2012. They earn between $6 -20 per day, in a country where the minimum wage is $6 a day. Today, there are three registered motorcycle taxi driver unions and the national secretary of the Liberian Motorcycle Transport Union, Robert M. Sammie, says his union is helping to formalize a flourishing trade. ""We decided to provide leadership and guardians (so) it just wouldn't be something done illegally and people could not respect you or regard you so that's why we incorporated to make us a formal business,"" says Sammie. Read this: Turning arms into art . He says the union now has about 40,000 members since it started in 2004. ""We are making headway. There are some challenges in a way, but actually the membership is increasing,"" he explains. From motorcycle driver to college student . The motorcycle taxis are known as ""pen-pens,"" a name that comes from the sound of their constant horn blowing. But driving them can be a hazardous job. There are few traffic lights in the country and many drivers service the rural areas of Liberia, where roads are poor. The increasing demand on motorcycle taxis has also led to an increase in accidents and Culey was involved in an accident in 2010. And despite being in a profitable business, Culey says he feels marginalized: ""Some people in this country think that motorcyclists are not important people,"" he explains. Sammie says his union is doing research sponsored by the German Society for International cooperation, GIZ, to establish comprehensive data on the situation of the commercial motorcycle transport. ""How many of (the drivers) are in school? How many of them have had accidents? When we get that done what we are thinking about is to see how we transition some of them from riding motorcycles to owning cars, going to colleges and so forth,"" says Sammie. ""We don't have to have a generation of motorcycle riders because if that happens it's not really going to be good in the near future.""","Liberia is celebrating 10 years since end of civil war .

"Last week, President Obama came to my country, Tanzania. President Kikwete and our people received him with great pride, but it is unlikely Obama heard anything about our government's plan to give a great chunk of land that has been the Maasai tribe's home for millennia, to a hunting company from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The hunters want this land to kill our lions and leopards and this deal will take away 40% of our grasslands and forested mountains that we call home. It threatens the wildlife and the Maasai's very existence. We want Obama and the international community to know our story and help stop our eviction. Read also: Maasai fight government, game hunters for lands . These attempts to clean us out of our old homelands have been happening for decades. The British moved us 50 years ago from what is now the Serengeti park and subsequent governments have consistently restricted our grazing rights. A large amount of land next to our community near the Serengeti National Park has already been handed to the hunters from the UAE. We often see Arab royalty arriving in their jumbo jets and then driving around in jeeps shooting anything they see moving and they keep wanting more. The government uses our faces on tourism posters and brochures for Tanzania, yet President Kikwete has said that our way of life is a thing of the past and we should live in the modern world. But without our land and our traditions, what are we? Most people in Loliondo raise cows and goats to pay for food and education for our children. Without grazing lands, many Maasai men have felt pressured to move to the city to take jobs as security guards. The women are left behind to raise our children and grandchildren and despite their hardship they are fighting to preserve our way of life. Read more: Maasai boy scares off lions with flashy invention . This new threat of such a large-scale land clearance has gathered Tanzania's Maasai like never before. Thousands of our men, women and children have traveled for days to meet government officials to state our case. Three hundred Maasai women marched on the capital Dodoma to protest, and in May, all of our community elders camped outside the Prime Minister's office in the capital for three weeks, demanding the UAE deal be abandoned. We are sure our brothers and sisters across the world can help. After we started an international campaign with Avaaz more than 1.7 million people around the world joined our cause. Today we are at home in our lands but fear that tens of thousands of villagers in our community could soon be evicted. A commitment from Kikwete can easily save us from the terrible fate that has befallen so many great tribes of the world. We know that the battle for our lands will not be easy, but as long as the government knows that the world is watching we will be safe. With that kind of attention, we have hope that our ancient way of life on our traditional lands will yet survive in the 21st century.","Tanzanian government threatening to evict Maasai from traditional land .

"A suburban Los Angeles school district is now looking at the public postings on social media by middle and high school students, searching for possible violence, drug use, bullying, truancy and suicidal threats. The district in Glendale, California, is paying $40,500 to a firm to monitor and report on 14,000 middle and high school students' posts on Twitter, Facebook and other social media for one year. Though critics liken the monitoring to government stalking, school officials and their contractor say the purpose is student safety. As classes began this fall, the district awarded the contract after it earlier paid the firm, Geo Listening, $5,000 last spring to conduct a pilot project monitoring 9,000 students at three high schools and a middle school. Among the results was a successful intervention with a student ""who was speaking of ending his life"" on his social media, said Chris Frydrych, CEO of the firm. That intervention was significant because two students in the district committed suicide the past two years, said Superintendent Richard Sheehan. The suicides occurred at a time when California has reduced mental health services in schools, Sheehan said. ""We were able to save a life,"" Sheehan said, adding the two recent suicides weren't outside the norm for school districts. ""It's just another avenue to open up a dialogue with parents about safety."" Teacher suspended after giving student a Twitter lesson . In another recent incident, a student posted a photo of what appeared to be a gun, and a subsequent inquiry determined the gun was fake, Sheehan said. Still, school administrators spoke with the parents of the student, who wasn't disciplined, the superintendent said. ""We had to educate the student on the dangers"" of posting such photos, Sheehan said. ""He was a good kid. ... It had a good ending."" In fact, no student has yet to be disciplined under the monitoring, but it's not out of the question if analysts find a message warranting action, such as a threat of a campus shooting, Sheehan said this week. ""I can see turning it over to police. That would be a situation in which discipline would follow,"" he said. Frydrych's firm scours the social media postings of Glendale students aged 13 and older -- the age at which parental permission isn't required for the school's contracted monitoring -- and sends a daily report to principals on which students' comments could be causes for concern, Frydrych said. The company won't disclose its methods and practices in gathering the students' messages, but it does use key words in its searches. The firm also didn't disclose how it confirms the youths are indeed students of the district. To do the work, Frydrych employs no more than 10 full-time staffers -- as well as ""a larger portion"" of contract workers across the globe who labor a maximum of four hours a day because ""the content they read is so dark and heavy,"" Frydrych said. ""It's mostly kids hanging onto a thread of life,"" Frydrych said, ""and they're posting to people also hanging on to a thread."" He declined to disclose how many school campuses have retained his firm, founded this past January in Hermosa Beach, California. Frydrych has been providing technology services to school districts the past 10 years. Geo Listening also monitors whether students are talking about drug use, cutting class or violence. The firm even ascertains whether pupils are using their smartphone during class time, Frydrych said. Florida university suspends fraternity over Facebook posts . While critics say the Glendale schools' contract is an invasion of privacy, Frydrych said his firm helps schools bridge a digital-age communications ""chasm."" ""Parents and school district personnel -- they are not able to effectively listen to the conversation where it's happening now,"" Frydrych said. ""The notion about talking in class is about as old-fashioned as a Studebaker, no offense to the makers of the car. ""When was the last time you sent a kid to the principal's office for talking in class too much? I just don't think it happens too much. So what we kept seeing is the chasm keeps building between how students communicate and the ability to tell adults about what's going on in their lives,"" he said. ""I thought we could bridge that gap."" Some experts in digital media and privacy, however, take exception. ""This is the government essentially hiring a contractor to stalk the social media of the kids,"" said Lee Tien, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that defends privacy, free speech and consumer rights. ""When the government -- and public schools are part of the government -- engages in any kind of line-crossing and to actually go and gather information about people away from school, that crosses a line,"" Tien said. He disagreed with school officials who say they are monitoring only public postings. ""People say that's not private: It's public on Facebook. I say that's just semantics. The question is what is the school doing? It's not stumbling into students -- like a teacher running across a student on the street. This is the school sending someone to watch them,"" Tien said. Sandy Russell, president of the school district's PTA, said parents have many questions about the monitoring, a topic that will be addressed later this month when the superintendent makes his regular appearance at a PTA meeting. Parents want to know how and why this is being done, Russell said. ""If it supports a child in a difficult situation -- whether it's bullying or stress level -- and if it helps, any parent would be thrilled to have the help. But how is that happening?"" Russell said. ""When you find something you're concerned about, what are you doing? Do you approach the child, with or without the parents? What does this mean? When people don't have information, they make up scenarios,"" Russell said. ""Some of the concerns I've heard is when kids say something nasty about a teacher, will they get in trouble? I understand that's not even remotely possible."" Superintendent Sheehan said students won't be disciplined for commonplace criticism. ""As far as anything said about teachers, as long as it's appropriate, it will be ignored,"" he said. Frydrych's firm doesn't hack into private postings by students, nor their e-mail or text messages. ""I find it interesting that people keep asking if we're doing something illegal or snooping or eavesdropping, but what we're actually doing is looking at public posts,"" Frydrych said. ""We don't see any private posts."" High school learns to love students' tech habits . Students can adjust their privacy settings if they don't want the world to see their tweets or Facebook updates. Frydrych's analysts stay abreast of the symbols, phonetic spellings, abbreviations, initials and other code-speak that youths type on social media. Hate, for example, could be spelled ""h8,"" and teens may refer to drugs with such words as ""red,"" ""rolling,"" and ""blunt,"" Frydrych said. In another example, Frydrych's firm learned how youths use drugs such as liquid hashish through vaporizers, or ""vapes,"" which are devices like electronic cigarettes that allow for inhalation without creating smoke, Frydrych said. Teachers may not be aware that students are dipping their mouths into their jacket in order to take a hit off their ""vapor pen,"" Frydrych said. Frydrych's team will be able to spot whether the student or a classmate posts a public message about that activity -- with a message stating, for example, ""can't believe a kid is getting high in geography right now, sucking on their vape,"" Frydrych said. What school officials do with the daily findings of Geo Listening is up the district, Frydrych said. ""This isn't about our company questioning parents,"" he said. ""We fully respect the challenges of being parents. ""We enforce the code of student conduct for every school we serve"" by compiling a day-by-day report, he said. ""It's up to the district to handle it."" His firm is about to expand schools' monitoring capacity with a new smartphone app that allows students and parents to anonymously report to and correspond with school officials about conduct violations. ""Honestly, we're not spying on kids. Can we focus back on the problem: The problem is we're not listening effectively,"" Frydrych said. ""And we're shifting that.""","Glendale, California, schools hire a firm to monitor students' public posts on social media .

"A Philadelphia priest convicted of a sex crime involving a 10-year-old boy has died while awaiting appeal, his church said Tuesday. The Rev. Charles Engelhardt, who was a priest at St. Jerome Parish in northeast Philadelphia, died Saturday of multi-system organ failure and a complete heart blockage at 67, Father Kevin Nadolski said. Engelhardt was in the process of appealing his sentence of 6 to 12 years in prison, stemming from his conviction relating to the indecent assault of a 10-year-old boy in the late 1990s. He was also convicted of endangering the welfare of a child, corruption of a minor, and conspiracy. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania granted and heard arguments from Engelhardt last month as part of his year-and-a-half appeals process. He has maintained his innocence throughout the trial and appeal, having pleaded not guilty to sexual abuse and conspiracy charges back in 2011. ""I continue to believe that he's completely innocent,"" Father Nadolski said. Englehardt's victim, now in his 20s, reported to authorities in 2009 that he was sexually abused while he was in Catholic grade school by Engelhardt and other priests. A grand jury determined his allegations had merit, and the priests were subsequently charged and arrested. They were among dozens of Philadelphia priests accused of sex abuse in a grand jury report. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said at the time of conviction that the prison sentence ""sends a clear message to sexual assault victims in Philadelphia. If you come forward, you will be heard,"" he said.  Williams called the verdict ""just."" A parochial teacher, Bernard Shero, who authorities said raped the same boy in 2000, was convicted of rape, attempted rape, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, indecent sexual assault and other charges. He is still being held in the Houtzdale, Pennsylvania State Prison.","A Philadelphia priest convicted of a sex crime involving a 10-year-old boy has died while awaiting appeal .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The two U.S. hikers detained for two grueling years in Iran on spying charges have been sentenced to eight years in prison, Iran's state-run TV reported Saturday. Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer each received five years for espionage -- specifically ""cooperating with the American intelligence service"" -- and three years for illegal entry, IRINN reported, quoting an ""informed"" judiciary source. They have 20 days to appeal their sentence, which was handed down by the Revolutionary Court, IRINN reported. Their defense attorney, Masoud Shafiei, couldn't confirm news reports of the sentencing. Their families have made urgent appeals to free the men and created a website to muster support for their release. They could not be reached for comment on the reported sentences. Fattal and Bauer and another person, Sarah Shourd, were seized on July 31, 2009 when they were hiking in the Iraqi Kurdish region and allegedly crossed into Iran illegally. Shourd, Bauer's fiancee, was released last year because of medical reasons, but the two men remained imprisoned in Iran. Shourd's case remains open, IRINN reported. United States and Iran, which don't have diplomatic relations, have been at odds over the Islamic republic's nuclear aspirations and Iran's ties to anti-American militants in the Middle East and Afghanistan. The hikers' case could exacerbate the hostilities during next month's U.N. General Assembly meeting. Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has made fiery and controversial speeches at the annual event and is expected to be there again this year. The United States has repeatedly called for Fattal and Bauer's release. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said U.S. officials were working to confirm media reports of the sentences and trying to get more information with Switzerland, which represents U.S. interests in Iran. Swiss Ambassador to Iran, Livia Leu Agosti, said the Iranian judiciary has not yet informed her of the prison sentences. ""We have repeatedly called for the release of Shane Bauer and Joshua Fattal, who have now been held in Iran's Evin prison for two years,"" Nuland said. ""Shane and Josh have been imprisoned too long, and it is time to reunite them with their families.  As Secretary (Hillary) Clinton has said, 'We continue to express our hope that the Iranian authorities will exercise the humanitarian option of releasing these two young men.' "" World leaders, such as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, have urged Iran to release the men. Amnesty International noted that Bauer and Fattal have been granted one brief family visit when their mothers met with them in May 2010. ""They have been denied adequate access to their lawyer and have had very limited access to consular assistance,"" the human rights watchdog said last month. ""Iranian authorities have ignored repeated appeals from the international community and the men's families to release them and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has hinted that the hikers were being held as a bargaining chip to be used in Iran's dealings with the United States."" Iranian police said the Americans illegally entered Iran. The Tehran Prosecutor's office has ""compelling evidence"" that the three were cooperating with U.S. intelligence agencies, Press TV has reported. Shourd has said the hikers did not know they had crossed the border while hiking. Fattal and Bauer pleaded not guilty to the charges. The three are graduates of the University of California at Berkeley. Shafiei argued that his clients shouldn't be regarded as spies because they don't have the ""characteristics and background of spies."" Shafiei had said the time the two have spent in Iranian custody is enough, even if the court reached a guilty verdict in a recent hearing. Shourd was released in September and returned to the United States after 410 days of solitary confinement. She remained a defendant in the case, but was not required to appear in court for a July 31 hearing.

"Hugo Chavez, the man who built his powerful persona on a populist platform of sharing Venezuela's vast oil wealth with the poor and disenfranchised, leaves his nation with a greater distribution of cash to the poor. But his death also leaves an economy in tatters, some analysts say, as the country had to step in and massively devalue its currency 30% to the U.S. dollar last month. While the OPEC-member nation is sitting on the world's largest oil reserves and is among the biggest oil exporters, oil production has declined. An influential leader with a mixed record . Chavez built his political base in the barrios of Venezuela, and his pledge to share the wealth among the nation's poorest is the strongest measure of his success during 14 years in office. The inequal distribution of wealth dropped to among the lowest in the Americas during his tenure. In 2011, the Gini coefficient -- which measures income inequality --was .39, down from nearly .5 in 1998, according to the CIA Factbook. That is behind only Canada in the Western Hemisphere. ""He's made Venezuelans feel proud to be Venezuelan again. And that is something I think that really no other leader in that country has done there before -- in fact, they were doing the opposite,"" Eva Golinger, a former Chavez advisor, told CNN. Chavez's death draws sympathy, anger . Those living below the poverty line fell to 36.3% in 2006 from 50.4% in 1998, according to the World Bank, and infant mortality fell from 20.3 per thousand births when Chavez came to power, to 12.9 by 2011. Education also became more accessible, with the number of children enrolled in secondary education rising from 48% in 1999 to 72% in 2010, according to UNESCO figures. ""He has changed the lives dramatically of the majority of Venezuelans, he's altered the country forever, his policies have reduced poverty more than half and have brought people out of dire circumstances (who) today enjoy a decent standard of living,"" Golinger said. ""His policies have implemented widespread national healthcare for all Venezuelans fee of charge."" Chavez's death leaves many questions . But ""Chavismo"" and his program of ""21st Century Socialism"" have been bankrolled by the national energy company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Critics say Chavez used the state oil company like a piggy bank for pet government project funding homes, healthcare and food while neglecting oil infrastructure and production. ""He is supporting social programs by bleeding the state oil company PDVSA, which accounts for 95% of export revenues and 12% of the GDP,"" William Ratliff, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, recently wrote. ""Chavez came into power in Venezuela promising the people that had been left on the margins and ignored by the political class in that country a new opportunity to participate in the economy, participate in the decision-making in the country,"" said Roger Noriega, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. ""Unfortunately he's destroyed the economy and centralized all power in his hands, decimated the democratic institutions in the country and left the Venezuelan democracy in even worse shape."" Under Chavismo, oil specialists were sacked and replaced by party loyalists, foreign oil contracts were radically altered or canceled, making investment in Venezuela risky business for international firms. ""These factors have really led to shortages in basic staples. So, Venezuelans for example suffer from a lack of in some cases, baby diapers, or flour, or corn meal, which is the basic daily dietary of the Venezuelan diet, so this is just an example of the distortions in the economy that have been a result of Chavismo,"" Kathryn Rooney Vera of Bulltick Capital told CNN. Chavez leaves Venezuela saddled with high inflation -- 22.2% year-on-year in January, according to the Central Bank of Venezuela . After Chavez nationalized foreign-run oil fields, critics say oil production has slowed. ""Venezuela in 2008 was producing 3.2 million barrels per day. One of the most recent statistics I have shows Venezuela producing 2.5 million -- so that shows you a decrease of the last four to five years,"" Vera said.","Chavez will be remembered for improving the wealth and political participation of the poor .

While Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves, production dropped under Chavez .
Venezuela devalued its currency by 30% last month and is saddled with high inflation ."
"Last week the world welcomed its 7 billionth inhabitant.  But behind the headlines is a complicated demographic picture -- and one that masks huge disparities. The current rate of growth means that there are 78 million more people every year. Nearly all of that growth -- 97 out of every 100 people - is occurring in less developed countries. In developed nations, on the other hand, population growth rate has largely stagnated: in Japan and Europe for instance, bringing with it concerns about lower fertility and aging. Africa's rapid population growth -- 2.3 per cent a year, double the rate of Asia's -- puts pressure on its economies as governments struggle to provide education and health services. The issue of women and children's health is one of the most pressing. Births that are too early, late or closely spaced reveal a whole host of critical issues affecting the health of Africans. I believe the population issue in sub-Saharan Africa is one of gender. Too many women lack the freedom to exercise choice when it comes to childbearing. Often this is a question of access. In remote locations women are forced to walk many kilometers to obtain contraceptives, and in some areas they are simply not available. Across the world more than two in five pregnancies are unplanned.  Clearly 'unmet need' for contraception is a wasted opportunity to boost development and stabilize population growth through something women want and need: the ability to decide when to become pregnant. Just how big is 7 billion . If all women had this ability, survey data shows, average global childbearing would immediately fall below the 'replacement fertility' value of slightly more than two children per woman. Then there's social pressure. Women are often required to have large families to improve their social standing and ensure their economic survival. In many countries girls marry at a very young age, become pregnant too early and cut short their education to take care of their young family. Poorly educated and unable to work, they are unable to contribute financially to the family coffers and so the cycle of poverty is perpetuated.  In addition, young mothers face terrible threats to their health such as fistula -- a hole in the birth canal caused by prolonged labor without prompt medical intervention. Fistula leaves women with chronic incontinence which renders them a social outcast. The link between family size and social standing is a subject close to my heart and goes back to my own childhood in Karakore, a small town in Ethiopia, where I grew up the eldest of seven children. My grandmother had one child, my mother, and I vividly recall the shame that she was made to feel because she had given birth to 'just one child' -- and a daughter at that. I also remember that girls in my class at school would disappear suddenly and re-appear around a year later. As I grew older I realized that these young girls had become pregnant, and had been forced to move to other villages due to the shame they had been made to feel. My own mother lost a child, and I recall the deep emotional trauma that followed.  So I encountered something of the suffering felt by far too many African women. That's why I believe women must be empowered to be able to make their own decisions free from fear of coercion or pressure from partners, family, and society. Their sense of self-worth should not depend on the number of children they have. They must have easy access to a range of safe, effective, and affordable contraceptives and the information and counseling needed to use them. Six of world's fastest-growing cities in China . But contraceptive access needs to be backed by better health infrastructure - we have abundant evidence that when parents are confident that their children will survive, they will have fewer and invest more in each of them. After years of neglect, there is a renewed interest in family planning as a driver for development. Experience has shown us that education for girls, legal reform and access to family planning have made a difference in many countries. While it's true that economic and social development leads to women having smaller families, the converse is also true -- that the gains that contraception has made possible in women's health make family planning one of the most successful international development stories. My mission as IPPF's new Director-General  is to build on those gains, to do our utmost to ensure that Africa's women and girls have the services, supplies and information to exercise their reproductive rights and  live their lives with dignity, respect and meaning.","The current growth rate means that there are 78 million more people every year .

"Ames, Iowa (CNN) -- Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann won the Ames Straw Poll Saturday, besting eight other Republican candidates in a nonbinding but politically significant vote in the first caucus state of Iowa. ""This is the first step toward taking the White House in 2012,"" Bachmann told the crowd. ""And you have sent a message that Barack Obama will be a one-term president. This is a wonderful down payment on taking the country back -- and it started in Iowa."" The vote was billed as one that could make or break some campaigns. Six Republican presidential hopefuls on Saturday personally appealed for Iowans' vote, not including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. She drew throngs at the Iowa State Fair on Friday but has yet to officially decide if she's running. Bachmann secured 4,823 votes, narrowly besting Texas Rep. Ron Paul who had 4,671 votes. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty was chosen on 2,293 ballots, placing him third. Paul's campaign chairman Jesse Benton said the result proved that the congressman is ""a top-tier candidate"" that indicates ""our message is spreading, our support is surging, and people are taking notice."" Pawlenty, who has trailed in recent polls despite heavy investment in Iowa, issued a statement saying, ""We made progress in moving from the back of the pack into a competitive position. ... We are just beginning, and I'm looking forward to a great campaign."" The next closest contenders, in order, are: former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum with 1,657 votes, businessman Herman Cain with 1,456 votes, and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney with 567 votes. That was slightly less than the 718 who wrote in the name of Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- who declared his candidacy Saturday and wasn't even on the ballot. Part country fair and entirely political, the Ames Straw Poll has helped take the pulse of a campaign's strength since 1979. It's also the first opportunity for the tens of thousands of voters who weighed in Saturday on which GOP president candidate they support. The results were announced around 5:30 p.m. CT, capping days of intense politicking and several hours of speeches from candidates and other prominent Republicans. Bachmann had reason to celebrate, but had a little competition in the headlines department: Perry announced his presidential bid at a meeting of conservatives in South Carolina. The timing of his announcement prompted some grumbling among Iowa Republicans. Nine announced candidates were on the Iowa ballot, although two of them -- Romney and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman -- skipped the contest. Huntsman is avoiding the Iowa caucuses completely, while Romney's advisers are carefully watching the state and could pounce in the coming months if they see an opening. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was on the ballot, too, but his cash-strapped campaign did not have a formal presence at the straw poll and he only got 385 votes. Michigan Rep. Thaddeus McCotter shelled out thousands of dollars to reserve campaign space outside the straw poll venue, but -- while he played up the perils of ""big government"" and of ceding ""the 21st century (to) Communist China"" -- he was not, as expected, a major factor, securing a mere 35 votes. Bachmann had been positioned at or near the top of most Hawkeye State polls thanks to the passions she has stirred among tea party activists and social conservatives who make up a large part of the caucus electorate. But there are questions about how strong her organization in the state is and whether she can compete with Pawlenty's respectable ground game. Like Huckabee in 2007, though, Bachmann has a natural appeal to evangelicals and home-school activists who tend to show up at political events like straw polls. In her speech in Ames on Saturday, Bachmann exuded optimism -- proudly and loudly insisting, ""We are the team that can't be beat."" Besides playing up her roots in Iowa, where she was raised, the three-term U.S. representative cast herself as a fiscal conservative and ""national security conservative."" Still, some of the most impassioned parts of her speech dealt with her stances on social issues. ""We are social conservatives, and we will never be ashamed of being social conservatives,"" Bachmann said. ""We understand that religious liberty is the essence of the foothold of this nation."" Another candidate who came in with high expectations was Paul, given his strong performances in straw polls at various conservative gatherings over the years. Such successes are a testament to the devotion of his libertarian-leaning followers and their ability to outorganize and outhustle the competition. But these days, political observers and members of the media take his straw poll wins for granted. And these victories have yet to translate to larger ones for the now three-time presidential candidate -- who hasn't broken through yet in Republican elections nationally. Speaking Saturday, Paul called for fewer government regulations and more ""freedom for America."" ""Liberty and life does not come from the government,"" he said. ""It comes from our creator."" As much as the vote -- a fund-raiser for the Iowa Republican Party -- could catapault some candidates, it may also eliminate those who have staked their candidacies on Iowa but struggled to generate grassroots enthusiasm. They included Santorum, who acknowledged his underdog status but promised a comeback. ""This is the little-engine-that-could campaign,"" the staunch social conservative said. ""They told us we had no chance."" Cain, a businessman and former radio host running on his outsider image, is fading after a strong early start to the campaign. He had tried to manage expectations for the straw poll, but recently told a Des Moines audience that he needs to finish in the top three. Anything less, he said, would compel him to ""evaluate"" his campaign. In a raucous address Saturday, Cain ran through his positions on a host of economic, foreign policy and other matters while saying Americans ""are ready to embrace a problem-solver and not another politician."" Referring to an epiphany he had 12 years ago after his first grandchild was born, ""I had to use my talents, skills and abilities to do something about this nation and get it off the wrong track,"" Cain said. ""This giant has awakened and is not going back to sleep."" Pawlenty's performance in the poll was seen as especially critical. Observers had said he must finish in first or second place and send a message to his supporters (and the media) that his campaign can soldier on through the fall and winter. The former Minnesota governor has a platoon of smart political operatives in his corner and is thought to have the best ground game in the state. But despite planting an early flag in Iowa and improving his performance on the stump in recent weeks, the Midwesterner remains stuck in single-digits in state polls. On Saturday, he echoed many others in blasting President Barack Obama, claiming he ""has no clue"" and saying ""he is like a manure spreader in a wind storm."" Pawlenty also vowed that his ability to get re-elected in Minnesota shows he has the track record to succeed in governing and also win over swing voters. ""I don't just talk about it. We got the job done, for Minnesota and America,"" he said. The results of the Iowa straw poll will be carefully scrutinized by political analysts, helping propel some candidates in their fundraising and campaign efforts elsewhere even as it deflates others. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a veteran observer of Republican politics in the state, said it is critical that a candidate do well if they are to have any chance, down the line. ""If you're not in the top three here, your chances of getting elected are not very good,"" he said. But history shows a straw poll win hardly guarantees future success in the state or nationwide. In 2007, ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney won the vote, but his closest rival in the state, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, ultimately won the Iowa caucuses and dealt a fatal blow to Romney's candidacy. The Republican nominee that year, meanwhile, was Arizona Sen. John McCain. Only one Republican has won the straw poll and gone on to occupy the Oval Office: George W. Bush.","NEW: The congresswoman thanks her supporters, saying the vote ""sent a message""

"Preliminary results in Sunday's referendum on whether Ukraine's Crimea region should join Russia or become an independent state show overwhelming support for Russia. With 75% percent of the ballots counted, close to 96% of voters want to become part of that country, according to the Crimean Electoral Commission. An official had announced earlier that more than 80% of voters had cast ballots by the time polls closed at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday. Final results are expected later. ""We are going home. Crimea is in Russia,"" Crimea's Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov told crowds celebrating in Simferopol's Lenin Square. Music blared as they cheered and waved Russian flags. The United States has already said it expects the Black Sea peninsula's majority ethnic Russian population to vote in favor of joining Russia. Moscow has strongly backed the referendum. U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Sunday, according to a readout from the White House. ""President Obama emphasized that the Crimean 'referendum,' which violates the Ukrainian constitution and occurred under duress of Russian military intervention, would never be recognized by the United States and the international community,"" it said. ""He emphasized that Russia's actions were in violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and that, in coordination with our European partners, we are prepared to impose additional costs on Russia for its actions."" Earlier, the White House released a statement that said the vote was ""administered under threats of violence and intimidation from a Russian military intervention that violates international law."" The voting has put the United States and Russia on the kind of collision course not seen since the end of the Cold War.  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reaffirmed in a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the United States considered the referendum illegal under Ukrainian law and that the United States would not recognize the outcome. The European Union on Sunday repeated its ""strong condemnation"" of the referendum and called on Russia to withdraw its troops from the region. It, too, has called the referendum illegal and said it is looking at sanctions. Lavrov said in a statement Saturday that Crimea's referendum conforms to international law. European nations and the United States have announced some targeted punishments against Russia and have threatened tougher sanctions if the secession vote goes through, as now appears likely. Is the referendum legal? 'Russia is an opportunity' At a polling station in Perevalnoye, near a military base, a steady stream of voters arrived to cast their ballots despite the wintry weather. Blaring dance tunes and Russian folk music welcomed them to the polling station, in an echo of Soviet times. What appeared to be a group of Russian soldiers -- without identifying insignia but with Russian license plates on their vehicles -- stood nearby. One voter, Grigory Illarionovich, told CNN, ""I'm for restoring Crimea to Russia. Returning what Khrushchev took away."" The Black Sea peninsula was part of Russia until Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in 1954. Ukraine was then part of the Soviet Union. Another voter in Perevalnoye, Viktor Savchenko, said he would never vote for the government in Kiev. ""I want us to join Russia, and live like Russians, with all their rights,"" he said. Victoria Khudyakova said she also had voted to join Russia, which she sees as being ""spiritually close"" to Crimea. ""For me, Russia is an opportunity for our Crimea to develop, to bloom. And I believe that it will be so,"" she said. But Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, speaking in Kiev, dismissed the referendum as illegitimate under Ukrainian and international law and improperly run. He said Ukrainian authorities had information from Crimea about voting irregularities, including people who are not Crimean citizens casting ballots, the absence of proper monitoring and the presence of armed men. Mikhail Malyshev, the head of the Crimean Election Commission, said there was no information that people with foreign passports were voting in the referendum. He also said no ""provocations"" had been reported at polling stations. CNN analyst and Russian journalist Vladimir Pozner similarly stressed that Sunday's vote was in no way staged. ""When you look at the celebrations, you can't doubt that these people really are very happy,"" he said. Double voting? In Simferopol, voters filed into a polling place, picked up white and yellow ballots and headed to private booths to fill them out before dropping them through the slits of clear ballot boxes. In another polling station, the vast majority of ballots dropped in the boxes appeared to be marked in favor of joining Russia. Some 80% of voters turning out at a polling station in Bakhchysaray were not on the electoral roll, the registrar told CNN. Those not on the roll have their passports and papers checked to establish identity. On the spot, election staff decide, with a show of hands, whether to allow those voters to participate. A CNN team photographed one voter dropping two pieces of paper into the ballot box, raising questions over how effectively the vote is being monitored. Turnout was high, but many Crimean Tatars, an ethnic Turkic group with deep roots on the peninsula, were boycotting the vote, as were many ethnic Ukrainians. Tatars, who make up about 12% of the Crimean population, have faced severe persecution in the past, when Crimea belonged to Russia. On Saturday, representatives issued a statement recognizing Ukraine with its present borders, which would include Crimea. They asked the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev for more legal protection for their ethnic group. Much pro-Russian propaganda has been in evidence in the run-up to the referendum, both on the airwaves and in the form of campaign posters showing the Crimean Peninsula painted with either a Nazi swastika or the Russian flag. Moscow has insisted it has the right to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine, who it claims are threatened by radical nationalists and ""fascists."" Could Donetsk go in the same way as Crimea? Russian squeeze . Pro-Russian troops remain firmly in control of the Black Sea peninsula. Ukraine and the West insist the soldiers belong to Moscow, but the Kremlin vehemently denies it, saying they are Crimean ""self-defense"" forces. Ukraine's acting Defense Minister Ihor Tenyukh said Sunday that Ukraine had reached an agreement ""with the Russian side"" that Russian forces will allow the delivery of food and basic supplies to Ukrainian military bases in Crimea until Friday. The bases have been blockaded for days. Tenyukh told a Cabinet meeting that there are now 21,500 Russian troops on Crimean soil. Russia is entitled to station 25,000 troops at its leased Sevastopol naval base -- but the question is where those troops are. Tenyukh also said Ukrainian troops and equipment are being moved into Ukraine's east and south, in line with where Russian military forces are located. Moscow has been carrying out mass military exercises not far from Ukraine's eastern border. Russia tightened its military grip on Saturday within Ukraine. About 60 Russian troops in six helicopters and three armored vehicles reportedly crossed into Ukraine's Kherson region and were in the town of Strilkove, on a strip of land just northeast of Crimea. The region is key to neighboring Crimea, because it gets electricity, fresh water and natural gas from there. The Russians said they were in Kherson to prevent a possible terrorist attack on oil assets, according to Ukrainian border guards. German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized Russian activities in Kherson in a phone call with Putin on Sunday, according to a statement from her office. She urged an increase in the presence of observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, so they can quickly be sent to contested areas, especially in eastern Ukraine, and called on Putin to talk to the government in Kiev. The Kremlin's readout of the phone call said the pair had ""constructive"" discussions on sending an OSCE observer mission to Ukraine. Putin also voiced concern that ""radical groups"" in league with Kiev were stirring up tensions in eastern and southeastern Ukraine and argued that the Crimean referendum is legal, it said. Ukraine's Cabinet said Sunday it had asked for a new OSCE diplomatic monitoring mission to be sent to Ukraine. A military observer mission is currently in the country but has been prevented from entering Crimea. CNN team in Crimea: This is a McMoment to remember . What happens next in Crimea? If the vote goes in favor of joining Russia, as it looks like it will, Crimea's government will declare its independence and ask Moscow to let it join the Russian Federation. Russian lawmakers have said they'll vote on the question on Friday. Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Iraq and Poland, described Sunday as a bad day for East-West relations. ""Putin has left our president with no choice. He needs to impose sanctions. I know Putin will come back and impose his own,"" he said. ""I think the end of this is going to be to cast Russia out into the cold. And the problem is, I don't think Putin really cares. I think this is where he wants to take Russia."" In Simferopol and other places with Russian majorities, blue, white and red Russian flags have dominated the streets. In the coastal Crimean town of Sevastopol, concerts on the main square have been celebrating the return to the ""motherland"" this past week. ""Everybody believes the results are already rigged,"" said CNN iReporter Maia Mikhaluk from Kiev. ""People are concerned what is going to happen after the referendum,"" she said. ""People are concerned that the Russian army will use force, guns to push (the) Ukrainian army from Crimea."" In the city of Donetsk, near the Russian border in eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian demonstrators stormed the prosecutor's office, forcing their way through a door of the building. The activists are demanding the release of pro-Moscow movement leader Pavel Gubarev, who was arrested on March 6 for leading an occupation of the regional administration office. Earlier, thousands of pro-Russian demonstrators gathered for a second day in a central Donetsk square before marching through the city. Riot police stood on guard outside the offices of Ukraine's security service and the regional administration. Addressing the Cabinet meeting, acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said small rallies in Donetsk and another nearby city, Lugansk, had ended. About 4,000 pro-Russian protesters have gathered for a third rally, in Kharkiv, he said. Deja vu about Georgia in Ukraine? Not exactly . Opinion: Can West make Putin blink?

"Choosing healthier snacks may soon be easier. The Food and Drug Administration says that updating nutrition labels is a priority this year, although it's unclear when the labels will change. The labels have remained pretty much the same for decades. It wasn't until the late 1960s that most food labels listed any nutrition information at all. At the time, labels with calorie or sodium counts were mainly used on products the FDA considered to have ""special dietary uses"" -- for people with high blood pressure who were watching sodium, for instance. Most people were making meals at home then, so there wasn't a huge demand for this information. That changed as more people started eating processed foods. Noticing the trend, the White House pulled together a conference of nutritionists and food manufacturers in 1969. But it wasn't until 1972 that the FDA proposed regulations about what those nutrition labels should show. Nutrition labeling was voluntary at first. It wasn't until 1990 that the FDA required nutrition labels for most prepared and packaged foods. Labels for raw produce and fish remains voluntary. ""It's time to update (labels) to make (them) easier for consumers to use,"" said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The nonprofit organization advocates for better safety and nutrition information in the food industry. ""This is a chance to make (the labels) better and help make it easier for people to choose healthier options,"" Wootan said. There's been a shift in shoppers' priorities as nutrition is better understood, and people now have a better idea of what they should watch on a label, the FDA said. The focus has been on fat content; now nutritionists say calorie counting may be more important and should be broken down better for consumers. The Center for Science in the Public Interest gave the FDA its wish list for these labels.  It wants a label that will emphasize calorie counts, perhaps in a bigger or bolder font size or in a number highlighted in some way. The organization would also like added sugar to get its own line on labels. Studies show many Americans eat more sugar than they realize. Our bodies don't need sugar to function, according to the American Heart Association. Right now, it's hard to know what's natural sugar and what's added from reading a label. Manufactures are allowed to combine the two. The heart association recommends you limit added sugar to no more than half of the daily discretionary calories you're supposed to have. That means for American men, about 150 calories a day or nine teaspoons. For women it's a smaller amount -- no more than 100 calories per day from added sugar, or about six teaspoons of sugar. The Center for Science in the Public Interest would also like to limit the amount of math you now have to do when counting calories. If you have ever looked at a label and realize you've eaten twice the serving size, you'll appreciate that request. The organization also hopes to make the ingredient lists larger with better spacing. More Americans are interested in what's on these food labels. The U.S. Department of Agriculture noticed a statistically significant jump in a study it released this month. The study showed 42% of working-age adults between 29 and 68 looked at these labels most of the time when shopping, or even said they always did. Some 57% of Americans older than 68 did as well. In a 2007 USDA study, 34% of working-age adults looked at the label, and 51% of Americans older than 68 did. The increase is good news as the United States struggles with an obesity epidemic. More than a third of all Americans are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some studies have shown that people who read labels eat healthier. One 2005 study of African-American shoppers in North Carolina found that to be true. A 2012 study of college students in Minnesota saw similar results.","The Food and Drug Administration is looking at how to update nutrition labels .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona civil rights activist says he accepts Katt Williams' apology for an anti-Mexican rant during a comedy show in Phoenix last weekend, but he's calling on the comedian to return to the city to ""show his commitment to the Latino community."" ""What he said was borderline hate speech and racially offensive,"" said Rev. Jarrett Maupin, who is organizing a boycott of Williams' stand-up act. His words could also create ""violence and tension"" in the community, he said. Williams, an African-American comedian known more for his erratic behavior than his jokes in recent months, issued a written statement through his publicist Wednesday that included an apology. ""My remarks were not meant to be offensive,"" Williams said. ""I want to apologize if my comedy act was taken out of context."" ""I sincerely appreciate my fans within the Mexican community and would never intentionally go out of my way to offend them,"" he added. Video of the rant, delivered during a performance at the Celebrity Theater Saturday night, was posted online. Williams singled out a man seated near the stage and asked him if he was Mexican. ""It appears to me y'all like it over here a lot,"" Williams then said. He then launched into his tirade. ""Do you remember when white people used to say 'Go back to Africa,' and we'd have to tell them we don't want to? So if you love Mexico, (expletive), get the (expletive) over there!"" Williams said to the man. As the rant turned into a back-and-forth profanity-laced argument with the man, Williams exclaimed, ""We were slaves, (expletive). You just work like that as landscapers."" Several times during the outburst, Williams sang parts of the U.S. national anthem and chanted ""USA, USA, USA."" ""His comments were extremely inappropriate, particularly knowing the climate here in Arizona,"" Maupin said. The state has been a political battleground in recent years over passage of an immigration reform law. ""He crossed the line with his comments about going back to Mexico, his comments about the historical aspects of how the Southwest became a part of the United States from Mexico,"" Maupin said. ""Much of it didn't make sense, and that is the dangerous part of this."" Williams' ""flippant statements reflect poorly on the African-American community and there's noticeable tension in our community,"" he said. ""Celebrities' comments can lead to violence and tension in the community."" The written apology is not enough, Maupin said. ""I accept the apology if it's sincere, but his remarks were offensive."" The ""real test of his commitment"" is Williams' willingness to do more. ""My challenge to him will be for him to return to show his face, to show his commitment to the Latino community and his commitment to civil rights,"" he said. He suggested that comedian Tracey Morgan's return to Nashville, Tennessee, this summer to personally apologize for anti-gay remarks in a stand-up show there is an example of how Williams can make amends. ""We can meet in a church, we can meet in the Celebrity Theater, wherever he feels comfortable,"" Maupin said. Maupin said he was surprised by Williams' rant because his previous dealings with the comedian were positive. ""I have compassion for Katt Williams,"" he said. ""It's up to him to let the community know if he's going through some personal or professional challenges."" Williams' often raunchy style has drawn comparisons to comedy legend Richard Pryor, but Maupin said there is a ""noticeable difference"" in Pryor's joking about race and what Williams said in Phoenix. Williams began his career as a stand-up comic. His career breakthrough came with the 2006 HBO special ""Katt Williams: Pimp Chronicles Pt.1."" The last two years, however, have been highlighted by several arrests and other incidents at clubs. CNN's JD Cargill contributed to this report.","NEW: Williams' words are ""borderline hate speech,"" a civil rights activist says .

"The hair. The girls. The screaming. The jolt created by The Beatles' invasion of America couldn't happen today. We're just too connected. In today's world, the Fab Four's frenzied Hamburg and Cavern concerts would be all over YouTube. Twitter would be abuzz about this new group with the funny hair and the screaming fans. Countless cell phones would be raised in glory at their every move. There would be no element of surprise, no sense of unveiling. But 50 years ago, it was revelatory. 5 things to know about Beatlemania . On February 9, 1964, The Beatles made their U.S. debut on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" Sullivan was a Sunday night staple, one of the great variety shows, a TV version of vaudeville with comedians, acrobats and song-and-dance acts. Into this staid carnival came four fresh-faced Englishmen with their hair and guitars. Americans had heard their music in the first few weeks of 1964 -- ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" was already the No. 1 song in the country and other Beatles numbers were making their way up the charts -- but John, Paul, George and Ringo were essentially unknown, two-dimensional photos at best. The Sullivan appearance kicked off the American strain of Beatlemania, a fever that had already infected their native Britain. It would last for years, morphing along with the band as they performed in stadiums, retreated to the studio, experimented with drugs, married, divorced, bickered and eventually broke up. The Beatles of myth, The Beatles of reality . Now, a half-century later, The Beatles are back -- and Beatlemania has struck again. CBS is airing a special devoted to the group. Capitol Records, The Beatles' label, is re-releasing the band's 13 U.S. albums. CNN is airing ""The British Invasion,"" a look back at the musical revolution the band spawned. It's co-produced by Tom Hanks, who expertly recreated the time in his 1996 film ""That Thing You Do!"" Everybody with a memory -- not least Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, the surviving members of The Beatles -- is making the rounds. At the Grammy Awards on Sunday night, McCartney and Starr reunited for a song and were frequently singled out by presenters. Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison, John Lennon and George Harrison's respective widows, presented the album of the year award. The audience, invariably, cheered. In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution. The Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl perhaps said it best on the Grammys red carpet. ""The Beatles,"" he observed, ""are the foundation of everything we do."" 'It was an unreal situation' But first came the hair, the girls, the screaming. ""It began with shrieks, sirens and total panic,"" wrote Gail Cameron in Life magazine of their arrival at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport -- renamed just weeks earlier for the fallen president -- rarely failing to mention a ""mop of hair"" or ""Beatle haircut."" Newsweek scoffed. ""Visually, they are a nightmare: Tight, dandified Edwardian beatnik suits and great pudding bowls of hair,"" the magazine wrote. The hair, to a postwar world used to crew cuts and short back-and-sides, was novel. Reporters asked to touch it. Fan clubs gave away snippets, like pieces of the One True Cross. But the screams? They had screamed before -- for Liszt, for Sinatra, for Elvis -- and they would scream again. But they had never screamed like this. The scene at JFK, the crowds around New York's Plaza Hotel, the jet-engine squeals inside CBS' Studio 50 for the debut appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" -- they were, literally, unheard-of. ""I did (cue) cards for Presley, and I remember kids yelling. But nothing close to what happened (then). You can't compare the two,"" says Vince Calandra, at the time a 29-year-old production assistant for Sullivan. ""It was an unreal situation."" Did you get swept up in Beatlemania? Share your memories here . The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964. Kennedy's assassination 10 weeks earlier had left a gloom on the land. Together, the two events created a dividing line between Then and Now. ""A lot of people don't understand why (Sullivan) was a seminal moment in the history of America and, for that matter, the history of the world,"" former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee recalled in a recent speech. ""The country had just gone through a very painful time of mourning. ... There was an extraordinary amount of despair, heartbreak, disappointment,"" he continued. ""I think people forget that we were still grieving as a nation. ""The Beatles brought something to America more than music. They brought hope."" As former Rolling Stone editor Ben Fong-Torres told CNN's Piers Morgan this week: ""They were a novelty. They were so different. And they were so good and they were so charming and they were so cute."" At the time, though, only the true insiders -- visitors to Britain, Sullivan's scouts, international correspondents -- knew what to expect. They knew that something was happening, but even they didn't know just what it was. They would find out. 'You could buy this stuff?' The United States was a different country. It's somehow appropriate that The Beatles' appearance was in black-and-white. The mod, colorful '60s were partly a result of their handiwork. ""When we got here, you were all walking around in f**kin' bermuda shorts, with Boston crew cuts and stuff on your teeth,"" recalled John Lennon in 1970. ""We just thought, 'what an ugly race.' "" The effect was immediate -- and overwhelming. In a country of 192 million, more than 73 million people saw The Beatles on Sullivan -- a record for an entertainment program and an incredible figure even in a three-network era, when 25 million viewers was a good performance. Other shows would surpass it -- ""Who Shot J.R."" on ""Dallas,"" the finale of ""M*A*S*H"" -- but in our fragmented cable-and-Internet world, only the Super Bowl gets bigger audiences nowadays. The Beatles also helped revive rock 'n' roll. Yes, Motown and surf music and girl-group pop were making inroads, but in their retooling of Chuck Berry riffs, R&B grooves and Everly Brothers harmonies, The Beatles carried it to another level. ""Back at the radio I caught 'I Saw Her Standing There' and was instantly convinced it was the most exciting rock 'n' roll I'd ever heard,"" rock critic Greil Marcus, then a Berkeley college student, wrote in ""The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll."" When a friend showed him the freshly purchased single, he was agog. ""You could buy this stuff?"" he asked. Back to The Beatles . Buy it they did. The Beatles dominated the charts. They had been booked on three straight Sullivan shows; the second one, broadcast from Miami, had ratings almost as high as the first. By April 4, they had all five of Billboard's top five singles. The next week, they had 14 songs in the top 100. Both are records likely never to be broken. Indeed, so much of what The Beatles did is now unassailable. Radio stations aren't as wide open as they were back then; nobody would ever program so many songs by the same artist. The iTunes charts seem to change hour by hour, so trends are washed away within days. Music has splintered into countless microgenres. So much of popular music -- both the business and the artistic inventiveness -- can be traced to The Beatles. If they're back, they've never really gone away. Three years ago, the group's 1969 album ""Abbey Road"" was the best-selling vinyl album of the year. Thirteen years ago, the greatest-hits package ""1"" was the No. 1 album in the country, wrapping up an eight-week stint at the top. Almost 20 years ago, all three of the ""Anthology"" volumes went to No. 1. And so on. The Beatles are part of our cultural DNA. The hair? It's now the norm. The squeals are dedicated to the boy band du jour. The music still reverberates. In February 1964, though, who could know what the future would bring? Not even The Beatles imagined becoming household names. And most observers -- besides the cheering fans -- could only see another fad, there to entertain the masses and make way for the next one. ""The only thing that's different is the hair, as far as I can see,"" Ray Bloch, Sullivan's musical director,told a reporter. ""I give them a year.""","50th anniversary of Beatles on ""Ed Sullivan Show"" is February 9 .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- The United States now recognizes the main opposition group in Libya ""as the legitimate governing authority"" in a country that Moammar Gadhafi has long ruled with an iron first, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. U.S. recognition of the Transitional National Council is a major diplomatic policy shift that could give the rebels access to Libyan regime assets that have been frozen by the United States. Clinton announced the change in Istanbul at a meeting of the Libya Contact Group, the alliance of nations working to deal with the Libyan crisis. Applause rippled through the audience as she spoke. Clinton said the Transitional National Council, also known as the TNC, ""continues to gain legitimacy as the representative of the Libyan people"" and conducts ""high-level diplomacy with governments worldwide."" ""So I am announcing today that, until an interim authority is in place, the United States will recognize the TNC as the legitimate governing authority for Libya, and we will deal with it on that basis."" The United States had previously stopped short of giving this recognition to the council, but Clinton said the body, based in Benghazi, Libya, ""has offered important assurances today."" They include ""the promise to pursue a process of democratic reform that is inclusive both geographically and politically, to uphold Libya's international obligations and to disburse funds in a transparent manner to address the humanitarian and other needs of the Libyan people."" The United States ""appreciates these assurances from the TNC, which reinforce our confidence that it is the appropriate interlocutor for us in dealing with Libya's present and addressing Libya's future."" In Zintan, rebel military commander Hajj Ousama Jwaili, a commander in the western mountains, said Friday that he considers the announcement ""another indication of support by the international community toward the rebel fighters."" He added, ""This is an appreciated move by the U.S., and more countries should do the same."" Gadhafi reacted with derision to the U.S. announcement. ""Their decisions, meetings, recognitions and their statements are all under your feet -- trample on them,"" he said Friday in an audio message, purportedly taped in Zlitan and broadcast on state-run television. ""This is our answer to all the decisions they took against the Libyan people."" The Libyan leader urged the NATO powers and others to take heed of what he said was his continuing popularity in Libya. ""You in America, Europe, Russia and everywhere, look! Look at the millions. Look at the Libyan people. More than 5 million people carrying the pictures of Gadhafi are ready for jihad and for martyrdom."" He called for ""traitors"" to give up their effort to overthrow his regime, warning that failure to comply will have consequences. ""They must abandon their weapons and turn themselves in from Benghazi to Misrata to Zintan,"" he said. ""We will not hold anyone who turns in his weapons accountable. If this does not happen, the march of millions will take place."" The Libyan uprising began in February, when opposition forces began fighting to oust Gadhafi and his regime. NATO forces have been operating under a U.N. mandate in Libya to protect people from aggression by Gadhafi forces. Clinton said the United States ""will help the TNC sustain its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Libya, and we will look to it to remain steadfast in its commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms."" ""In contrast, the United States views the Gadhafi regime as no longer having any legitimate authority in Libya,"" she said. Diplomatic efforts have been ongoing to end the crisis, and Clinton said Libyans are ""looking past Gadhafi."" ""They know, as we all know, that it is no longer a question of whether Gadhafi will leave power but when."" Clinton said the coalition will continue to target Gadhafi's command and control if he keeps threatening the citizenry. ""The terms of a cease-fire are clear. Gadhafi must stop attacks or the threat of attacks, remove his troops from all of the places they have forcibly entered and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance. ""The terms of a political process that will produce a cease-fire and pave the way to a democratic Libya are also clear. It must involve Gadhafi's departure and an inclusive effort to build a new constitutional framework that redeems the democratic aspirations of all the Libyan people."" As for the recognition step, a senior State Department official reiterated that the rebel council's political and economic assurances ""turned the tide"" in their favor. ""We sent a very clear signal ... to the TNC that we recognize them as the future of Libya,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. ""As such, we're going to take steps to make sure that they're able to carry out their functions."" A final statement issued by the Contact Group raised a range of points, including an agreement by the participants ""to deal"" with the Transitional National Council ""as the legitimate governing authority"" in the country ""until an interim authority is in place."" It also welcomed monetary pledges and encouraged financial help. ""Noting that the unfolding situation in Libya since mid-February has disrupted the operations of foreign companies and contractors, the Contact Group welcomed the commitment of the (Transitional National Council) to open up Libya to foreign investment as soon as possible and its commitment to honor any existing legal contracts signed under the Gadhafi regime,"" it said. It also cited ""the need for establishment of a genuine cease-fire and provision of safe humanitarian access remain as urgent as ever."" The group ""urged all relevant parties to explore ways and means of paving the way for the formation of an interim government to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition of power with the widest popular support possible,"" it said. CNN's Elise Labott and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","Gadhafi asks Libyans to ""trample"" on the U.S. announcement .

"Constanta, Romania (CNN) -- There was once a time when Romania's president Traian Basescu made a living steering huge oil tankers through the bustling waters of Constanta harbor on the country's eastern coast. Now the ship captain-turned-statesman aims to navigate the Black Sea port towards a new age of prosperity -- as a strategic trading hub between East and Western Europe. ""Until December 1989, the Constanta harbor was mainly used to export the goods produced by the Romanian economy and to import raw materials,"" Basescu told CNN. ""(Today) it is more of a gate, first of all for Romania connecting (the country) with the world, and in same time it is a gate for central and Eastern Europe,"" he added. See also: The world's most entertaining airports . Ensuring Constanta and the hinterland rail, road and canal services beyond the port fulfill their true potential, however, will prove a demanding logistical challenge. The port currently operates at just 50% of its 100 million ton annual handling capacity. Much of Romania's creaking inland freight infrastructure is in need of modernization, having been built and designed during the country's communist era. The Romanian section of the Danube canal catered for 31 million tons of goods in 2012, a steady increase on previous years but still only a third of its full capacity. Despite these less than fully productive figures, Basescu remains optimistic. He says Constanta is the gateway at the end of a giant ""blue motorway"" stretching more than 1,500 miles from the North Sea port of Rotterdam via waterways in Holland, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Serbia. ""From a strategic point of view, it's (of) extraordinary importance having such a harbor which is connected with all of Europe,"" Basescu said. ""It's the single harbor which is connected with Danube, with the Rhine-Main-Danube canal and with Rotterdam,"" he added. See also: Where is the world's best airport . This enthusiasm for Romania's maritime and logistical development is shared by the country's continental partners keen to facilitate the smooth passage of goods across Europe's frontiers and beyond. But not all are as content as Basescu as to the progress currently being made in this endeavor. The EU commissioner for regional development, Johannes Hahn, recently stated that the 14 countries (including Romania) involved in strengthening trade in the Danube region still had to ""step up a gear"" after making a promising start. Basescu rejects such analysis as hypercritical, believing it is not fully representative of the commitment and progress his country has made towards improving its infrastructure since joining the EU in 2007. ""I don't know why the commissioner is so pessimistic,"" he said. ""We have already invested more than 300 million (euros) on the Danube using the European money for the period 2007-2013 and it will continue."" See also: How tiny city packs big economic punch . Basescu sees the benefits of increased trade these projects will likely bring as a key component of Romania's development strategy in the coming years. The country remains one of the poorest in the European Union -- only Bulgaria has a lower GDP per head of population, according to Eurostat. ""It is vital not only for the EU, but for Romania,"" he said. ""We have to develop the capacities for large vessels in Constanta harbor (but) there are a lot of other things to be done."" Ensuring the Danube is a solution to move goods and commodities through Romania to central Europe is ""a key element for us in our development strategy,"" he added.","Romanian president, Traian Basescu, aims to guide Constanta Harbor towards a new era of prosperity .

"Liberia went to the polls Tuesday for a runoff election after incumbent President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf failed to win the votes needed for an outright victory last month. Johnson Sirleaf, who won the Nobel Peace Prize this year, needed 50% to avoid a runoff in the October 11 election, but did not reach it.  Polls were scheduled to close at 1 p.m. EST. She faces challenger Winston Tubman, who came second. While the U.S.-based Carter Center said the October balloting was ""peaceful, orderly, and remarkably transparent,"" opposition parties have protested the results, and claimed voting irregularities. Tubman has reportedly refused to participate in the runoff, alleging it won't be fair, and there have been calls to boycott the election, the United Nations has said. On Monday, members of the Tubman's Congress for Democratic Change clashed with police in what authorities called an unauthorized protest, state-owned radio network Liberia Broadcasting System reported. At least one person was killed and several others wounded in the clashes in the capital city of Monrovia, the network reported. Both U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the Security Council have called on Liberians to refrain from violence. ""Regardless of your political views, I appeal to all Liberians to say no to violence on Election Day,"" said Ellen Margrethe Loj, the U.N.Secretary-General's special representative and head of the U.N. Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). It is the second presidential election since a 14-year civil war ended in 2005. The war devastated Liberia and left an estimated 250,000 people dead, and voters are hoping for more peaceful and prosperous days ahead. Johnson Sirleaf has said she wants to preserve the peace. ""We've put in the fundamentals, the foundation -- the possibility to reach our accelerated growth and development, fix our infrastructure, the potential, and chances are so high,"" she said before the election. Liberia faces many challenges: up to 80% of Liberians are unemployed and a majority live without basic necessities such as water and electricity.","Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  faced challenger Winston Tubman .

"Facebook is relaxing its rules for teenagers. The 13- to 17-year-old set now has the option to share photos, updates and comments with the general public on Facebook. That means strangers, and companies collecting data for advertisers and marketing companies, will be able to see select posts. Teenagers will also be able to turn on the Follow feature for their profiles, which would allow anyone they're not friends with to see their public posts in the main news feed. The changes will take effect immediately, the company announced in a blog post. The new setting might help Facebook compete against other social networks that skew younger, and having public data on teens will also help the company appeal to advertisers. The social network is trying to balance the less strict settings with two other privacy protections. When new underage users sign up for a Facebook account, their posts will be shown to a more limited audience by default -- only to friends instead of friends of friends. If a teen decides to change the setting to Public, she or he will see a pair of pop-up warnings explaining what ""public"" means. One warns they could end up ""getting friend requests and messages from people they don't know personally."" Default settings for existing teens with profiles won't change or affect past posts. Privacy? Forget it, we're all celebrities online now . Facebook has been around for more than nine years and stopped being a hip place for kids long ago when it was invaded by parents, grandparents and advertisers. It has 1.2 billion users. Even as it expands to all ages, the company has to work to hang on to the coveted teen demographic. In a recent Pew study, teens reported ""waning enthusiasm"" for the social network, citing the presence of adults and drama. The site has become too important to typical teen life to abandon, so  94% of teens on social media have a Facebook account, and the average teen user has 300 friends. Other social networks such as Twitter, Tumblr and Last.fm don't prevent teens from posting publicly. However, if someone under 18 wanted to bypass the setting on Facebook before today, they could easily lie about their age when signing up for an account. Children under 13 are not officially allowed to sign up for a Facebook account, though they can skirt the rules in the same way. When someone underage does sign up for an account, Facebook assumes they have the permission of at least one guardian but does not verify it in any way.

"The United States warned Syria in no uncertain terms Monday not to use chemical weapons amid intelligence reports indicating President Bashar al-Assad's regime could be preparing to take that step as it escalates its fight against rebel forces. ""I want to make it absolutely clear to Assad and those under his command -- the world is watching,"" President Barack Obama said during a speech at the National Defense University in Washington. ""The use of chemical weapons is and would be totally unacceptable. And if you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons, there will be consequences and you will be held accountable,"" he said. Obama has previously warned that any use of chemical weapons by Syria in its civil war would be crossing a ""red line"" that would prompt a swift U.S. response. Earlier on Monday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a similar warning. ""I'm not going to telegraph in any specifics what we would do in the event of credible evidence that the Assad regime has resorted to using chemical weapons against their own people,"" she said. ""But suffice it to say, we are certainly planning to take action if that eventuality were to occur."" U.S. officials are concerned that with fighting closing in on Damascus, forcing the temporary closure of the airport there, the regime may be feeling desperate and toying with the idea that chemical weapons could finally crush the persistent rebellion. Official: 'Worrying signs' regarding Syria's chemical weapons . ""We believe that with the regime's grip on power loosening with its failure to put down the opposition through conventional means, we have an increased concern about the possibility of the regime taking the desperate act of using its chemical weapons,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday. The Syrian Foreign Ministry denied that the country had any plans to use chemical weapons, state TV reported. Citing a source at the ministry, state TV said Syria has repeatedly stressed it will not use such weapons, if they exist, against its people no matter the circumstances. But U.S. officials say ""worrying signs"" suggest otherwise. According to one U.S. official, Syrian forces have begun combining chemicals that would be used to make deadly sarin gas for use in weapons to attack rebel and civilian populations. The United States obtained intelligence over the weekend indicating this development, according to the official who had direct knowledge of the latest information. The intelligence, the official said, came from multiple sources but the official declined to provide any more details about how the United States learned of it. Sarin gas, the source said, could most readily be used to fill artillery shells. ""This isn't just about movement, but about potential intent to make certain chemical weapons ready for use,"" said a separate source, another U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Read more: Opposition accuses Syria of 'mental war' after Internet blackout . That source declined to describe the intelligence and acknowledged that the United States isn't entirely sure what the Syrian government is up to, or who ordered the moves. Meanwhile, the United Nations said Monday that it is immediately pulling all nonessential employees out of Syria. It was unclear how many people were involved or what role they have been playing in Syria. The United Nations removed cease-fire monitors from the country in August. At least 239 people were killed in violence across Syria on Monday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. The attacks included the bombing by Syrian warplanes of a town within sight of the Turkish border, which killed 10 people. Thick black smoke rose from the border town of Ras al-Ain, where witnesses said warplanes dropped two bombs. One appeared to strike a three-story building where opposition forces were staying, neighborhood mayor Mehmet Saitavci said. The strike sent panicked civilians running to the fence that separates the two countries, witnesses told CNN.

In Damascus, apparent fighting around the airport forced Egypt's national airline to cancel flights to Syria, including recalling one flight that had taken off, after Syrian authorities contacted the airline to say the security situation was bad ""at the airport and its vicinity,"" airline spokesman Dina el-Fouly said. The airport had been closed for three days because of fierce fighting, and Egypt Air had planned to resume flights Monday. They are now canceled indefinitely, el-Fouly said. Elsewhere, government forces bombed, shelled and rained rocket fire on cities across the country in the latest efforts by al-Assad's forces to drive back rebel advances, opposition activists said. The airstrikes signal a sharp escalation in the fighting by forces loyal to al-Assad and rebels seeking his ouster, raising concerns among Syria's neighbors that the 21-month-old civil war could spill across the borders. Neighboring countries have reported deadly border skirmishes with either Syrian forces or rebels. In June, Syrian anti-aircraft defenses shot down a Turkish military reconnaissance jet, killing two pilots, after it briefly crossed into Syrian airspace in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Months later, errant Syrian artillery shells hit the border town of Akcakale, killing five Turkish civilians. As a result, Turkey has asked NATO for Patriot missiles to bolster its air defenses, a request NATO is expected to approve on Tuesday.

The United States, Germany and the Netherlands, which all have Patriot capabilities, have signaled they may be willing to contribute missiles should NATO approve the deployment to Turkey. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stressed to CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that the possible deployment of Patriot missiles is ""purely defensive,"" and not aimed at preparing a no-fly zone. ""We have no intention to intervene militarily in Syria. We will do what it takes to protect our ally Turkey,"" he said. However, Russia reiterated its opposition. ""We don't consider that this will lead to the improvement of security in the current situation."" President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dimitri Pesvok, said Monday.

"At least three people have been killed and 52 injured after Buddhist mobs rampaged through Muslim areas in southwest Sri Lanka, police say. The outbreak of religious violence followed a large rally Sunday by the Bodu Bala Sena, a hardline Buddhist nationalist group led by monks, in the town of Aluthgama, about 60 kilometers south of Colombo. The rally was prompted by the alleged assault of a monk by Muslim youths days earlier, police said. After the rally, violence erupted on both sides as the demonstrators marched through Muslim neighborhoods, allegedly chanting anti-Muslim slogans, according to a statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay. Muslim homes and shops were gutted in the violence, which has prompted Muslims in the region to gather in mosques for safety. Sri Lankan police spokesman Ajith Rohana told CNN that 12 people from Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority had been arrested over the violence, some of them members of Bodu Bala Sena. ""They have been remanded at the moment and we're framing charges in due course,"" he said. Soldiers had been brought in to enforce a curfew, banning people from the roads or from gathering in public places, in the hope of preventing further clashes in Aluthgama and the nearby town of Beruwala, coastal destinations popular with foreign tourists. The curfew was relaxed from 8 a.m. to noon Tuesday to allow people to leave their homes to gather supplies. Rohana said that ""sporadic incidents"" had been reported Monday night, but that authorities had the situation under control. The violence has alarmed international observers, with the U.N.'s Pillay urging Sri Lanka's government to ""urgently do everything it can to arrest this violence, curb the incitement and hate speech which is driving it, and protect all religious minorities."" ""I am very concerned this violence could spread to Muslim communities in other parts of the country,"" she said. Sri Lanka's Justice Minister Rauff Hakeem, a Muslim, said his party would weigh its future in the government depending on the official response to the attacks. ""I am ashamed I could not help my people,"" he said. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is in Bolivia for the G77 summit, commented on the clashes on Twitter. ""The Government will not allow anyone to take the law into their own hands. I urge all parties concerned to act in restraint,"" he wrote. ""An investigation will be held for law to take its course of action to bring to book those responsible for incidents in Aluthgama."" READ MORE: Are Sri Lanka's 'anti-terror' arrests an attempt to intimidate activists? About three-quarters of Sri Lanka's population are Sinhalese, most of them Theravada Buddhists. According to the country's 2011 census, 70.2% of the population is Buddhist, 12.6% Hindu, 9.7% Muslim and 7.4% Christian. In recent years, the country has witnessed a surge of Buddhist nationalism, led by the Bodu Bala Sena, the country's most powerful Buddhist organization, which has pledged to defend the religion. Its rally on Sunday was held in response to an earlier incident on Thursday, which is a public holiday in Sri Lanka commemorating the day Buddhism reached the island nation. Rohana said a Buddhist monk and his driver had been assaulted by a group of four Muslim youths, sparking anger among the Buddhist community. The four alleged assailants were subsequently arrested. He said the mob violence did not begin until the rally on Sunday. Fred Carver, of the UK-based Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice, urged Sri Lanka's authorities to rapidly take charge of the situation. ""We know from past experience that ethnic violence in Sri Lanka rapidly spirals and leads to phenomenal loss of life unless there is swift and effective intervention by the police,"" he told CNN. ""In the longer term, I hope the Sri Lankan Government reflects on the consequences of patronizing and endorsing extremist nationalists, while at the same time engendering a culture of impunity for those involved in ethnic violence.""

"The Des Moines, Iowa, woman named the world's oldest living person this month has died, according to her family. Dina Manfredini died overnight at the retirement center where she lived after suffering a fever, her granddaughter Lori Logli said Monday. She was 115 and apparently died in her sleep, Logli said. Guinness World Records identified Manfredini as the world's oldest person on December 5, a day after the death of 116-year-old Besse Cooper of Georgia. Manfredini was born in Pievepelago, Italy, on April 4, 1897, and moved to Des Moines in 1920 with her husband, according to her Guinness biography. She was an avid gardener who, after staying home to raise children and keep house, took up a job at the age of 90 cleaning houses, according to Guinness. She lived on her own until she was 110, when she moved to a nursing home, Guinness said. Guinness quoted Manfredini as saying that her long life was the result of her commitment to ""hard work and everything in moderation.""","115-year-old Dina Manfredini died overnight .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice invited the woman set to replace her as the nation's top diplomat, Sen. Hillary Clinton, to dinner Monday night, a State Department spokesman said. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, left, and Sen. Hillary Clinton dined together Monday night. The dinner took place at Rice's home in the Watergate complex in downtown Washington, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. The meeting lasted for two hours, he said. ""They talked just very generally about policy -- the challenges, the opportunities -- talked a little bit about the job of secretary of state, talked about the 'building,' managing a big operation,"" McCormack said. The two dined after Clinton met with members of President-elect Barack Obama's State Department transition team on Monday. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that important information often is exchanged during such dinners between outgoing and incoming secretaries of state. Albright, who was former President Bill Clinton's top diplomat during his second term, said she had a similar dinner with Colin Powell, President Bush's first secretary of state, in 2001.  Watch Albright give her advice to Obama » . ""I'm sure they had a social part of it, but Secretary Rice told her what the major challenges are, how the department works -- we call it 'the building' -- and, generally, I think they are very nice times,"" Albright said. ""It's just a matter of really turning over the most important job in the world on foreign policy,"" she added. Albright said Clinton will have to get up to speed on a number of issues, including the status of negotiations the U.S. is engaged in, who will be part of her team and how she will work with other members of Obama's national security team. ""I know from talking to her that she has a great sense of excitement and desire to ... reintroduce America to the rest of the world,"" said Albright, who said she thought that Clinton would be ""a very great secretary of state."" Earlier, Rice said she was looking forward to meeting her successor and said she believes Clinton will do ""a great job."" ""I talked with her and we're going to sit down, and I'm really looking forward to it. I've known her a long time, and she is someone that I admire,"" Rice told CNN on Sunday. Despite being from different parties -- and Clinton's tough criticism of Bush's foreign policy while she was a Democratic presidential candidate -- Rice has been effusive in her praise of the former first lady. ""President-elect Obama has made his choice, and he's made a terrific choice. Hillary Clinton is somebody of intelligence, and she'll do a great job,"" Rice told ABC News on Sunday. ""She also has what's most important to being secretary of state, and that is that you love this country, and you represent it from a basis of faith in its values. And I know that she will do that,"" Rice added. Obama's decision to tap Clinton as his top diplomat already has brought about changes. On Tuesday, former President Clinton released the corporate sponsors of a Clinton Global Initiative meeting in Hong Kong, a practice he previously has resisted. The sponsors of last week's meeting included CLSA, Laureate, the Roberson Foundation, Citi, the Li Ka Shing Foundation, The Economist, HP, Ogilvy, Suzlon, Thomson Reuters and CNN. The former president agreed to make it a regular practice to disclose the sponsors of his global initiative as part of a deal with the Obama transition team to allow the nomination of his wife to go forward. He also has agreed to allow State Department officials to review his speeches and other personal activities.","Secretary of state invites Sen. Hillary Clinton to dinner at her Washington home .

"Mitt Romney's refusal to release tax returns in the critical years of his income accumulation has done little to dispel the legitimate concern that arises from hints buried in his scant disclosure to date: Did he augment his wealth through highly aggressive tax stratagems of questionable validity? Opinion: Why won't Romney release more tax returns? One relevant line of inquiry, largely ignored so far, is to examine what exists in the public record regarding his attitude toward tax compliance and tax avoidance. While this examination is hampered because his dealings through his private equity company, Bain Capital, are kept shrouded, there are other indicators. A key troubling public manifestation of Romney's apparent insensitivity to tax obligations is his role in Marriott International's abusive tax shelter activity, as previously reported by Jesse Drucker in Bloomberg. Romney has had a close, long-standing, personal and business connection with Marriott International and its founders. He served as a member of the Marriott board of directors for many years. From 1993 to 1998, Romney was the head of the audit committee of the Marriott board. During that period, Marriott engaged in a series of complex and high-profile maneuvers, including ""Son of Boss,"" a notoriously abusive prepackaged tax shelter that investment banks and accounting firms marketed to corporations such as Marriott. In this respect, Marriott was in the vanguard of a then-emerging corporate tax shelter bubble that substantially undermined the entire corporate tax system. Son of Boss and its related shelters represented perhaps the largest tax avoidance scheme in history, costing the U.S. many billions in lost corporate tax revenues. In response, the government initiated legal challenges that resulted in complete disallowance of the losses claimed by Marriott and other corporations. In addition, the Son of Boss transaction was listed by the Internal Revenue Service as an abusive transaction, requiring specific disclosure and subject to heavy penalties.  Statutory penalties were also made more stringent to deter future tax shelter activity. Finally, the government brought successful criminal prosecutions against a number of individuals involved in Son of Boss and related transactions not associated with Marriott, including principals at major law and accounting firms. In his key role as chairman of the Marriott board's audit committee, Romney approved the firm's reporting of fictional tax losses exceeding $70 million generated by its Son of Boss transaction.  His endorsement of this stratagem provides insight into Romney's professional ethics and attitude toward tax compliance obligations. Like other prepackaged corporate tax shelters of that era, Marriott's Son of Boss transaction was an entirely artificial transaction, bearing no relationship to its business. Its sole purpose was to create a gigantic tax loss out of thin air without any economic risk, cost or loss -- other than the fee Marriott paid the promoter. The Son of Boss transaction was vulnerable to attack on at least two grounds. First, the transaction's promoters and consumers relied on a strained technical statutory analysis. Second, the Son of Boss deal violated the fundamental tax principle that the tax law ignores transactions unless they have a motivating business purpose and a substantial nontax economic effect. In the Marriott case, the IRS raised both arguments and won on the first interpretive issue. The Court of Claims (affirmed by the Court of Appeals) rejected Marriott's technical analysis, finding no reliable argument or authority to support it.  The court therefore did not need to reach the issue of business purpose and economic substance. In subsequent decisions, involving similar transactions but other parties, the courts have sustained the second line of attack as well, finding the claimed losses to be fictitious. The complete judicial rejection of the Son of Boss tax scheme was entirely predictable. In mid-1994, for example, roughly contemporaneously with Marriott's execution of its Son of Boss trade and well before Marriott filed its return claiming the artificial loss, the highly respected Tax Section of the New York Bar Association filed a public comment with the U.S. Treasury and IRS urging rejection of the technical claims made by promoters of such schemes. In his key position as head of the board's audit committee, Romney was required under the securities laws and his fiduciary duties to review the transaction. In fact, it has been publicly reported that Romney was the Marriott Board member most acquainted with the transaction and to whom the other board members turned for advice.  This makes sense because aggressive tax-driven financial engineering was a large part of what Romney (and Bain) did for a living.  For these reasons, it is fair to hold him accountable for Marriott's spurious tax reporting. Romney's campaign staff has attempted to deflect responsibility, arguing that he relied on Marriott's tax department and advisers. This claim is disingenuous. In a transaction of this magnitude, sensitivity and questionableness, the prudent step would be to secure advice to the audit committee and the board from experienced and independent tax counsel, who would certainly have cautioned that the Marriott position was risky and not supported by precedent or proper statutory interpretation. Moreover, on the key issue of the business purpose and economic substance, Romney was, or should have been, aware of the facts that the transaction had its genesis solely in tax avoidance and was a ""marketed"" tax shelter. He had an insider's perspective on the motivation and lack of substance in the transaction, as well as the financial sophistication to understand the tax avoidance involved. Romney failed in his duties to Marriott and its shareholders and acted to undermine the fairness of the tax system. No one could accuse Romney of lacking the intelligence and analytical skills to have dealt with this transaction appropriately. Indeed, his strengths in this regard were the reason the other board members relied on him. What emerges from this window into corporate tax compliance behavior is the picture of an executive who was willing to go to the edge, if not beyond, to bend the rules to seek an unfair advantage, and then hide behind the advice of so-called experts to deflect criticism when a scheme backfires.

"(CNN) -- The silverware keeps coming for Bayern Munich. When Bayern defeated outsider Raja Casablanca 2-0 in the final of FIFA's Club World Cup in Marrakech on Saturday, it collected a fifth trophy this year. Bayern won the Bundesliga, Champions League and German Cup last season under Jupp Heynckes, with the European Super Cup and now Club World Cup coming with Pep Guardiola at the helm. Bayern's lone blip was losing the German Super Cup to Borussia Dortmund in July. Raja Casablanca failed in its bid to become the first African side to win the competition, although the Moroccan champion did well to reach the finale after upsetting South America's Atletico Mineiro. Bayern was hardly threatened, even without the likes of Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mario Mandzukic, Javi Martinez and Mario Gotze in the starting lineup, and scored twice within 25 minutes to end any hopes of a shock upset. Brazilian defender Dante put Bayern ahead in the seventh minute when he was unmarked in the penalty area and Raja Casablanca keeper Khalid Askri made two good saves before Thiago Alcantara's strike in the 22nd doubled the score. And only a minor miracle, it seems, can stop Bayern from repeating as German champion after its main rivals stumbled Saturday. Bayer Leverkusen lost its second straight league game, 1-0 at Werder Bremen, while Borussia Dortmund -- Bayern's victim in the Champions League final -- fell 2-1 at home to promoted Hertha Berlin. It was Dortmund's fourth defeat in the past six games so the Bundesliga's Christmas break falls at just the right time for Jurgen Klopp's men. ""We can really use this break now, but it is only our fault,"" Klopp told reporters. ""Something that started well has ended badly. ""I can say a lot of things in support of the team but we should have lost none of the games that we lost this season."" Bayern has a seven-point lead over Leverkusen and 12-point cushion over Dortmund, with a game less played. Third-place in the Club World Cup went to Atletico Mineiro, which beat Guangzhou Evergrande 3-2 thanks to a stoppage time winner from Luan. Former world player of the year Ronaldinho scored for Brazili's Atletico Mineiro but was sent off in the 87th minute when he retaliated after being fouled.","Bayern Munich wins its fifth trophy of the year after capturing the Club World Cup .

"One man died trying to escape a burning ferry in the Adriatic Sea on Sunday afternoon, and hundreds more were awaiting rescue as night fell on the beleaguered vessel. Rescue crews worked into the night to airlift passengers by helicopter from the Italian-flagged Norman Atlantic, which caught on fire Sunday morning off the coast of Greece. In the early hours of Monday morning, the Italian Coast Guard confirmed that 201 people had been rescued. It's believed 276 are still on board the burning vessel. The fire has been contained, but smoke and weather conditions hindered extracting passengers in metal baskets from the ferry. They are being transported to merchant ships and an Italian Navy transport dock, from where they will eventually continue on to the Italian port of Brindisi or hospitals. Passengers suffering from smoke inhalation and hypothermia will be brought to hospitals in southern Italy, the Italian Coast Guard said. With rescue efforts under way, the focus of Italian and Greek media is shifting to the cause of the blaze, which is believed to have started in the ship's parking bay. At least one truck driver told the Greek news media that trucks filled with oil were ""packed like sardines,"" cargo scraping the ceiling, which could have set off sparks in rough seas to start a fire, he surmised. Those remaining on board awaited rescue on the upper deck -- ""dying of cold and suffocating from the smoke"" even as their feet were ""burning"" from the fire's heat, said a Greek passenger who called Italy's state broadcaster RAI TV. The disaster made national headlines in Greece, Italy and other countries with citizens aboard the ferry. In a Sunday morning public address, Pope Francis offered ""affection and prayers"" to those affected by the Norman Atlantic ferry fire as well as a collision in the Adriatic Sea between two merchant ships. Thick clouds of smoke enveloped the vessel earlier Sunday as rescuers awaited an opportunity to approach. At least eight ships were deployed, but heavy winds and freezing waters kept them at bay, making evacuation by air the only feasible option. Turkish diplomatic personnel are heading to Igoumenitsa, the likely port for evacuated passengers, according to a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement. Turkish citizens were among the passengers, with Greeks and Italians making up the majority.","Number rescued climbs to 201; there are 276 still on board .

"On our final 2014 trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table, our reporters shared insights on a key midterm year moment -- or a key marker to look for in 2015. Some of the nuggets were a bit of both: . 1. Elizabeth who? Clinton's important outreach to her left . We end the year with several liberal groups urging Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to change her mind and seek the presidency in 2016. Some of this is real, some is part fund-raising gimmick, and some is designed to keep pressure on runaway Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Politico's Maggie Haberman shared reporting of how Team Clinton is paying close attention -- and making key inroads. One group that has not joined the ""Draft Warren"" movement just happens to be the one perhaps closest to her, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Haberman took us inside a key meeting -- a top Clinton political aide sitting down with PCCC leadership. ""This is the first time you're seeing people in Clintonland trying to build a bridge openly, in a serious way, toward Warren's supporters. This is also the group that has not joined the draft movement. So I think that this is something you are going to see more of going forward."" 2. A Mississippi turning point . Robert Costa of The Washington Post highlighted the bruising Mississippi Senate primary as a 2014 turning point. Remember, tea party favorite Chris McDaniel nearly beat incumbent GOP Sen. Thad Cochran. ""If Chris McDaniel had won that primary, it would have cost Republican candidates across the country a lot of political points,"" Costa noted. ""They would have to answer for all of his statements, all of his radio comments from the past."" Instead, though, the GOP establishment carried the day. ""That primary really signaled what was happening in the party this year -- a push back against the tea party ahead of 2016, trying to get the party toward the center, back toward a winning coalition."" The tea party promises a comeback in 2015 and beyond. Worth watching. 3. A wartime presidential legacy? Julie Pace of The Associated Press recalled some big presidential decisions of 2014 that proved how difficult it is for President Obama to follow the foreign policy course he laid out in his initial 2008 campaign. ""One of the defining moments in 2014 for the White House was President Obama's decision to launch airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. I've covered Barack Obama for a very long time. And if you had told me that I would be writing about him going back into military conflict in the Middle East instead of pulling out of it, I would have told you you were crazy,"" Pace said. Looking back, Pace recalled ""getting out of the Middle East, war in the Middle East, was a central promise, a central promise that Barack Obama made to the voters.  And if he ends his presidency in military conflict, then I think it really jeopardizes the legacy for him."" 4. Obama betting on his 'emerging' coalition . In several big 2014 challenges, Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post saw Obama being guided by his loyalty to the new demographics of his core political constituency. And, she suggests, trying to send a signal to future Democratic candidates. ""Immigration reform, Obama's moves on Cuba, as well as some of his comments on Ferguson and race,"" were three topics Henderson believes can be linked, in part. ""Part of his, you know, sort of 'Bulworth' moment is realizing and really embracing the idea that the Democratic Party is -- is a black and brown party, is a party that is going to be progressive -- progressive around these issues of race. You know, part of sort of the downside of that, we saw some of that in 2014 with the cratering of the white vote."" (The 1998 comedy ""Bulworth"" is about a politician who starts saying exactly what he thinks.) But looking forward, Henderson notes, Hillary Clinton seems to agree with Obama. ""With Clinton very much doubling down on that, some of the comments she's made on race, her immediately coming out in terms of the immigration reform -- this is going to have consequences, I think, for the party, the Democratic Party, going forward."" And, she suggests, Republicans ignore the lessons at their peril. 5.  Boehner and McConnell's New Year's resolution . Old school is the way to go -- if you're Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader-to-be Mitch McConnell. Both are mindful that deadline budget deals have created political openings for what they consider harmful tea party antics in recent years -- most noteworthy, of course, the government shutdown. So their plan is to go back to old-fashioned budgeting: passing individual appropriations bills for government agencies and having those debates in the spring and summer -- well in advance of the October 1 beginning of the fiscal year. That way if, say, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas wants to derail the process because of some tea party objection, the delay happens harmlessly in the summer or early fall -- not up against the deadline. Same goes if it's the Democrats who are trying to make a point. Or even if there is a presidential veto of an appropriations bill. Less drama and political harm, Boehner and McConnell believe, if these things are dealt with in what Washington calls regular order. So if it is regular -- normal -- why is it such a big test? Well, the last time Congress and the White House went through a full appropriations process in regular order? Bill Clinton was president.","Clinton's team reaches out to Warren supporters .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama's inaugural address is one of the most anticipated speeches in decades, with many expecting his words to be chiseled into marble some day. Many expect Barack Obama's inauguration speech to compare to those given by Roosevelt and Kennedy. Obama aides said that the speech will last 18 to 20 minutes and that Obama will emphasize that America is entering a new area of responsibility. He will say that America has been hurt by a ""me first"" mentality that has contributed to the current economic crisis, aides say, and call on individuals -- as well as corporations and businesses -- to take responsibility for their actions. Obama has said he has been studying previous inaugural addresses -- including President Abraham Lincoln's and the speeches President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave as he took office amid the Great Depression. Given the nation's current economic crisis, Errol Lewis, a columnist for the New York Daily News, was looking for Obama to echo Roosevelt's famous 1933 inauguration address when he said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" ""He's got to calm the nation. I think he's got to reassure the nation and let people know that we are in it for the long haul. If you look at that 1933 speech, that is pretty much what FDR did,"" Lewis said.  Watch a preview of inauguration events » . ""He wants to lift us up ... and all the aspirations we have, all the hope,"" Lewis said. ""But at the same time, he has some very practical problems that start at 12:01 p.m., and he starts to own them at high noon. There are no easy answers."" Obama must also emphasize that his administration represents a fresh start for America and ""kick away from that old history,"" said Peggy Noonan, President Ronald Reagan's speechwriter and a columnist for The Wall Street Journal. ""It's been about a year since people thought they had a president, if you will. ... It's been some time since the American people heard, 'We've got an economic problem, but, baby, we are getting through it. We are going to get past this thing. We are going to rise again,' "" Noonan said.   Watch Noonan and others on the art of speech writing » . Obama has already demonstrated his ability as a master orator, and many observers are looking for the new president's address to equal the great speeches by presidents Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Reagan. ""He's got to give that great, soaring speech."" CNN contributor David Gergen said. ""I think the pressure is really on because of the historic nature of this presidency and also because of the extraordinary moment in which we find ourselves with this terrible recession.""  Watch what is expected from Obama's speech » . ""That is a lot to do in a single speech but, you know, because he has such a high reputation for giving excellent speeches ... the expectations for this one are just -- well, they're soaring,"" Gergen added. But beyond the nation's immediate economic concerns, Obama's inauguration speech with also mark a national milestone: the inauguration of the first African-American president. In his previous speeches, Obama has referred to another great African-American orator: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who made a historic speech on the other end of the Mall. Obama is likely to refer to King and the dramatic struggles African-Americans have fought as they emerged from slavery and fought for full civil rights.  Watch what Obama's presidency means to African-Americans » . ""If you think about the journey that this country has made, then it can't help but stir your heart,"" Obama told CNN's John King during an interview Friday. ""The notion that I now will be standing there and sworn in as the 44th president, I think, is something that, hopefully, our children take for granted, but our grandparents, I think, are still stunned by, and it's a remarkable moment."" The pressure on Obama to produce a speech for the ages not is limited to the public, Obama said. After a family visit to the Lincoln Memorial, which has Lincoln's second inaugural address inscribed on its walls, Obama's 10-year-old daughter, Malia, turned her father and said, ""First African-American president -- better be good.""

"Surabaya, Indonesia (CNN) -- A woman grieving for her brother and his family. Two teenage girls looking for their parents. A woman hoping her fiance is still alive. They are among the distraught families of passengers and crew on AirAsia Flight QZ8501 who are gathering at airports in the region, hoping that their relatives are safe. The plane carrying 162 people disappeared Sunday morning traveling from Surabaya to Singapore. Oei Endang Sulsilowati and her daughter arrived at the Juanda international Aiport in Surabaya looking for news of her brother, Oei Jimmy Sentosa Winata, his wife and their 13-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter. ""We saw what had happened on the television, and we are coming here to find out what is happening,"" Sulsilowati said. Her brother's family was traveling to Japan via Singapore, she said. ""I knew about this incident from watching TV and tried to get more information from my family. But my brother never flew with AirAsia, so I kept calm. Then someone told me that they saw his name on TV. ""Then I saw it,"" she said, breaking down in tears. ""We are just waiting for news"" Now they just wait. ""We don't know what to do,"" she said. ""We are just waiting for news."" Two young teenage schoolgirls arrived at Juanda International in the early hours. According to relatives and school officials who were traveling with the girls, they are friends whose parents were on the flight. The parents were traveling to Singapore to spend New Year's with their daughters. That flight never arrived, so the girls traveled to Surabaya to find out what had happened to their parents. They sat at a desk staffed by AirAsia officials, looking lost and bewildered, as they waited for information. At Changi Airport in Singapore, Louise Sidharta told Channel NewsAsia her fiance and his family were on the plane. ""When I was on the way to the airport, I listened to the radio and they said his plane was missing,"" she said. ""It was supposed to be his last vacation with his family"" before the wedding, she said. Indonesia is by far the hardest hit in this mystery because 149 of the 155 passengers were from that country. Surabaya is the crisis center. AirAsia Group CEO and founder Tony Fernandes flew in late Sunday night. 'It's unbelievable' His first words at the news conference: ""We are very devastated by what's happened, it's unbelievable. ""Our concern right now is for the relatives and for the next of kin -- there is nothing more important to us, for our crew's family, and for the passengers' families."" On Monday morning, he briefed the families behind closed doors. It's not known what he said. AirAsia staff has been taking families from Juanda International to the nearby Ibis Hotel to keep them together and, critically, to keep them informed. Many family members are in shock. They're teary-eyed, exhausted, confused and afraid. Some are grieving; others exude pure despair. Children are among them, in some cases clearly too young to grasp what's going on. ""I should have gone with them but I canceled it two weeks ago as I had something to do,"" one relative of a passenger said, sobbing, according to a translation by Channel NewsAsia. Speaking at Juanda International Airport, the relative -- whose name was not given -- said, ""This morning before I went to pray, one of them called me and jokingly said, 'See you in the new year and goodbye forever.' That's all, and then the bad news came."" 'We still have hope' William Kai, waiting in Surabaya for news of his brother-in-law and three other relatives who were on the flight, said he's hopeful the plane will be found soon, according to the BBC. ""This flight is only from Surabaya to Singapore, so it's not like it's missing in the Indian Ocean or the big seas,"" he said. ""It's just there. So it should be easier to find."" He also said he's not giving up hope for the safe return of his relatives. ""We still have hope,"" he said. ""We cannot lose hope."" The losses will be felt around the world. While nearly everyone on the flight is from Indonesia, there are also three South Koreans, one Malaysian, a French co-pilot, one Briton and one Singaporean, the airline said. Sixteen passengers were children and one was an infant. The British national is Indonesia-based energy executive Choi Chi Man, and the Singaporean citizen is his 2-year-old daughter, Zoe, Channel NewsAsia reported. Their names are on a flight manifest released by the airline. Airline vows to help families through the 'nightmare' Sunu Widyatmoko, the CEO of AirAsia Indonesia, said the company's ""main priority is keeping the families of our passengers and colleagues informed on the latest developments."" ""We will do everything possible to support them as the investigation continues and have already mobilized a support team to help take care of their immediate needs, including accommodation and travel arrangements,"" he said. Fernandes took to Twitter to console families and offer more information. ""I am touched by the massive show of support especially from my fellow airlines,"" he wrote. ""This is my worse nightmare. But there is no stopping."" The company switched its logo on its Twitter and Facebook pages from bright red to gray. What role did weather play? Families first . Peter Goelz, a CNN aviation analyst, chaired a task force that wrote the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996, which the U.S. Congress passed to provide guidance on how to deal with families when responding to these types of crises. That legislation ""set the worldwide standard"" in aviation disaster response, according to Goelz, and iterations of it have been adopted by ""virtually every country"" -- including Indonesia. ""The key is families need to hear it first. They need to hear what's going on, and they need to hear it from the investigators,"" Goelz said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""If you don't get the information to the families, it's just torturous."" Pope Francis said Sunday his thoughts ""are with those on board the missing AirAsia plane"" and with their loved ones. CNN's Josh Levs, Pierre Meilhan, Anna Maja Rappard and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","NEW: Airline CEO briefs families behind closed doors Monday morning .

"An eight-day search in Portugal near where Madeleine McCann went missing seven years ago has uncovered no new evidence, British police said Wednesday. London's Metropolitan Police -- also known as Scotland Yard -- are leading the hunt for Madeleine, who was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family's holiday apartment Praia da Luz, on Portugal's Algarve coast, in 2007. Scotland Yard said its officers had been working alongside Portuguese police and experts to search specific areas in the resort town. They had searched some 60,000 square meters of ground, including drains and derelict buildings, in what was ""the largest deployment ""ever undertaken by UK police overseas in a case of this type."" ""The decision to search the 'horse shoe' shaped piece of waste ground to the west of Praia da Luz and other sites was as a specific result of the UK's investigation work to date,"" police said in a statement Wednesday. ""Forty-one ground anomalies were identified initially by both aerial survey and ground analysis which were then investigated fully,"" they said. ""At this time no evidence relating to Madeleine McCann has been identified. However it has given us an essential understanding of the activity on and people that have used this piece of land."" Scotland Yard said there was still a ""substantial amount of work yet to be completed"" in its investigation, and that ""more activity"" was expected to begin shortly. ""This recent work is part of ensuring that all lines of enquiry are progressed in a systematic manner and covers just the one hypothesis that she was killed and buried locally,"" it said. Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, left the girl and her younger twin siblings asleep in the apartment on May 3, 2007, while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing. Last week, sources told CNN that British police were working on the assumption that Madeleine was dead, while their Portuguese counterparts were working on the assumption that she was still alive and had been taken out of Portugal by a non-Portuguese national who had been in the country for a short time. Scotland Yard's head of specialist crime and operations, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, told media on May 22 there would be ""specific police activity"" in Portugal in the coming weeks, relating to Madeleine's disappearance. ""It should not be assumed that this substantial upcoming phase of work in Portugal will immediately lead us to the answers that will explain what has happened,"" he warned at the time. ""What you will see is normal police activity you would expect in any such major investigation."" Rowley also told media that Scotland Yard had made it clear to their Portuguese colleagues that they would not be giving operational updates, saying: ""If media interfere with police work, that work will stop."" Scotland Yard reopened its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance in July 2013 after a two-year review of the original probe. Portuguese police reopened their investigation last October. At the time, Metropolitan Police said the two police forces' investigations would run in parallel. Madeleine's parents launched a massive publicity campaign to find their daughter and say they continue to believe she is still alive.","Madeleine McCann disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Portugal in 2007 .

"(CNN)  -- Oprah Winfrey once dubbed it the ""greatest love story"" she had ever heard: a boy held at a Nazi concentration camp during World War II and a girl on the outside who tossed him apples to keep him alive. They eventually married and grew old together. Herman Rosenblat has acknowledged his Holocaust love story is fake: ""I am sorry."" It turns out the story of Herman and Roma Rosenblat isn't true. The two had told their love story for years and years, inspiring a book deal, an upcoming movie, and stories across the globe on television, in papers and on the Internet. A children's book, ""Angel Girl,"" was also based on their love story. When the couple appeared on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" more than a decade ago, the famed host called it ""the single greatest love story in 22 years of doing this show.""  Watch how Holocaust love story proves bogus » . But over the weekend, Herman Rosenblat issued a statement through his literary agent, Andrea Hurst, acknowledging the story of how he met his wife was made up. ""Why did I do that and write the story with the girl and the apple, because I wanted to bring happiness to people, to remind them not to hate, but to love and tolerate all people. I brought good feelings to a lot of people, and I brought hope to many. My motivation was to make good in this world,"" he said in the statement. ""In my dreams, Roma will always throw me an apple, but I now know it is only a dream."" Herman Rosenblat really was in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II -- a subcamp of Buchenwald -- and he really has been married to Roma for decades.  Beyond that, the truth is murky.  See the true horrors inside Buchenwald concentration camp » . Berkley Books immediately canceled publication of Rosenblat's memoir, ""Angel at the Fence,"" which was set to be released in February. ""Berkley will demand that the author and the agent return all money that they have received for this work,"" Berkley spokesman Craig Burke said in a statement. A movie version of the Rosenblats' story -- even though now proven a hoax -- remains in the works. Atlantic Overseas Pictures says the movie is a fictionalized adaptation and that ""the story retains its power to grip audiences worldwide."" Many Holocaust scholars had long cast doubt on the Rosenblats' story. Professor Ken Waltzer, the director of Michigan State University's Jewish Studies program, said he began raising questions to the agent and publisher in November, suggesting that the story was fabricated. But he says his numerous queries went unanswered. He says he told the editor that the story is ""at best embellished and perhaps invented."" ""The idea of a prisoner being able autonomously to approach the fence not just once, but every day at the same time, ... none of it seemed plausible,"" Waltzer says. ""That fence was right next to the SS barracks, so to go to the fence, which was also punishable by death, was to risk death."" In a letter to ""The New Republic,"" which first began questioning the validity of the Rosenblats' story, Waltzer said he was also disturbed about why few others had come forward to point out holes in the couple's account. ""Less understandable is the widespread belief in their story -- by the culture makers, including the publisher and movie maker and many thousands of others who have encountered it over a decade,"" he said. ""Second, such belief suggests a broad illiteracy about the Holocaust and about experience in the camps -- despite decades of books, serious memoirs, museums, and movies. This shakes this historian up."" ""This memoir was at the far end of implausibility, yet until yesterday, no one connected with packaging, promoting, and disseminating it asked questions about or investigated it. Some actively resisted such investigation and tried to shut mine down."" New Republic special correspondent Gabriel Sherman told CNN another disturbing element is that Herman Rosenblat really is a Holocaust survivor who ""didn't need to embellish his love story, because his own story is so powerful.""  Watch Sherman describe the unraveling of the love story » . Sherman said Rosenblat was shot during a robbery in the 1990s at his workplace. When he was was in the hospital, Rosenblat said he had a vision from his mother to tell his love story. ""From that moment on, he started telling his story in public,"" Sherman said. In his statement released over the weekend, Herman Rosenblat said, ""To all [who] supported and believed in me and this story, I am sorry for all I have caused to you and everyone else in the world."" Holocaust scholars say they hope the revelation that the love story is fictitious doesn't distract from the reality of the Holocaust, when Nazi Germany killed 6 million Jews. ""On the far extreme, something like this could give fuel to those who are in the business of denying that the Holocaust ever took place,"" said David Marwell, director of The Museum of Jewish Heritage. CNN's John Zarrella and Randi Kaye contributed to this report.","Herman Rosenblat admits his Holocaust love story is false: ""I am sorry""

"St. Louis police shot and killed a young African-American man Tuesday after authorities say he brandished a knife. The shooting took place not far from Ferguson, Missouri, where the shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer has touched off violent protests. ""The suspect, who right now is described as a 23-year-old African-American, was acting erratically -- walking back and forth up and down the street,"" St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters. ""As officers arrived, the suspect turned towards the officers and started to walk towards them clutching his waistband. He then pulled out a knife ... and told the officers, 'Shoot me now. Kill me now,'"" the chief said. Responding officers told the man, repeatedly, to stop and drop his knife, Dotson said. He continued to approach, coming within about four feet of one of the officers, Dotson said, adding that both officers then fired their weapons, striking the suspect. According to the St. Louis police chief, the suspect was involved in an incident earlier in the day at a convenience store, where he is accused of walking out with two energy drinks and a package of pastries without paying. Asked about whether he was concerned Tuesday's shooting could inflame passions further in nearby Ferguson, Dotson talked about the importance of officer safety. ""If you're the family of a police officer and somebody approaches you within three feet with a knife, I think you have the right to defend yourself and protect yourself. So I think it certainly is reasonable that an officer has an expectation to go home at the end of the night,"" he said.","Authorities say the young African-American man brandished a knife .

"About half of all Americans disapprove of President Barack Obama's incoming executive action on immigration despite agreeing with Obama on principle, according to a recent poll. Nearly six in 10 Americans support creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., but just 38% approve of the President's plans to use his executive power to act on immigration, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Wednesday. Another 14% said they were unsure about or had no opinion on Obama's planned executive action on immigration. The poll comes as Obama is expected to announce Thursday that he will sign an executive order to shield as many as 5 million illegal immigrants. The legal battle over Obama's immigration plan . Republicans are up in arms about the President's plan to use executive action to reform the U.S. immigration system, which they describe as a move to bypass Congress that exceeds his constitutional authority. Support for a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants increased to 74% when given the details of the bill that passed the Senate last year, but did not get a vote in the House. Those details include ensuring illegal immigrants pay a fine, back taxes and pass a background check before starting the process to become American citizens. Obama's plan is also expected to redirect U.S. immigration officials to refocus their deportation efforts on criminals who are undocumented immigrants. And officials have also told CNN that Obama's plans could also expand worker visas for certain sectors, like technology. Obama to reveal immigration executive action plans on Thursday . A CNN exit poll on Election Day this month also showed that 57% of Americans believe illegal immigrants should get a chance to apply for legal status.

"Dating site OkCupid is calling for its members to ditch Firefox and use another browser to search for love. The company is protesting Mozilla's new CEO, Brendan Eich, who supported an anti-same-sex marriage campaign. Firefox is owned by Mozilla. When OkCupid members navigate to the site on a Firefox browser, they are met with a message encouraging them to use an alternative browser to access the site, including Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and the amusingly misspelled Internet Exploder. ""Those who seek to deny love and instead enforce misery, shame and frustration are our enemies, and we wish them nothing but failure,"" reads the message. The page points out that 8% of the matches made on OkCupid are between same-sex couples. Last week, Mozilla promoted Eich, a longtime employee who was previously the company's chief technology officer, to the position of CEO. The move prompted renewed outrage by third-party developers and employees. Eich donated $1,000 to support Propostion 8 in 2008. The California ballot initiative sought to ban same-sex marriage in the state. The donation was made public in 2012 but Eich held onto his job. After the announcement of Eich's promotion, app development company Rarebit announced it had pulled its apps from Firefox. ""As a married gay couple who are co-founders of this venture, we have chosen to boycott all Mozilla projects,"" said founder Hampton Catlin in an open letter to the company. Various Mozilla employees have also spoken up about the promotion, taking to Twitter to openly share their disappointment with Eich's politics. Some have come together and publicly called for Eich to step down. Eich posted a blog on his personal site last week addressing the backlash. He outlined his plan to support LGBT-friendly policies at Mozilla and expressed ""sorrow at having caused pain."" ""I am committed to ensuring that Mozilla is, and will remain, a place that includes and supports everyone,"" he said. The apology hasn't satisfied everyone, and the backlash continues to grow one week later. OkCupid is one of the most high-profile companies to take a stand against Eich's appointment. The letter on the OkCupid home page is a bold move. However, it is not actually blocking Firefox users from using OkCupid. At the bottom of the page is a link to continue on to the site. ""Mozilla supports equality for all, including marriage equality for LGBT couples. No matter who you are or who you love, everyone deserves the same rights and to be treated equally,"" said a Mozilla spokesperson in a statement. ""OK cupid never reached out to us to let us know of their intentions, nor to confirm facts.""","Dating site OkCupid has asked users to not use the Firefox browser .

"After a lifelong battle with mental illness, the youngest son of Pastor Rick Warren has committed suicide, his family said. Matthew Warren, 27, died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound on Friday, said Deputy Daniel Aikin, with the Orange County Coroner's Office. The family shared news of his death in an e-mail to church staff. Rick Warren and his wife founded Saddleback Valley Community Church, a megachurch in Southern California. ""No words can express the anguished grief we feel right now,"" the pastor wrote in the note, a copy of which was sent to CNN. ""You who watched Matthew grow up knew he was an incredibly kind, gentle, and compassionate man. He had a brilliant intellect and a gift for sensing who was most in pain or most uncomfortable  in a room. He'd then make a bee-line to that person to engage and encourage them. ""But only those closest knew that he struggled from birth with mental illness, dark holes of depression, and even suicidal thoughts. In spite of America's best doctors, meds, counselors, and prayers for healing, the torture of mental illness never subsided."" According to Aikin, Matthew Warren's body was found at his home in Mission Viejo, California, late Friday afternoon. He put the estimated time of death at around 10 a.m. that day. The coroner's office is investigating the death. An autopsy will be conducted early next week, Aikin told CNN on Saturday. According to a spokesman for Rick Warren, Matthew Warren worked in the Saddleback Resources Warehouse, which distributes books and DVDs. Matthew Warren's uncle, Tom Holladay,  preached at the church Saturday night. He thanked members for coming and said that ""we're facing it as a family."" ""We're going to be real together about our hurts, and we're going to be real together about the thing that only He can give us: Hope in the face of anything and everything,"" Holladay said. As a pioneer of the megachurch movement, Rick Warren looked to translate traditional evangelical messages to a wider audience. The pastor gave the invocation at President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration and penned ""The Purpose-Driven Life,"" a Christian self-help guide that became a mainstream best-seller. ""I'll never forget how, many years ago, after another approach had failed to give relief, Matthew said 'Dad, I know I'm going to heaven. Why can't I just die and end this pain?' but he kept going for another decade,"" Rick Warren wrote in the e-mail. In a separate statement, his church asked for prayers and that ""God's comfort and peace"" be with the Warren family.","Matthew Warren, 27, died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, says an official .

"A nervous new doctor performing a procedure for the first time puts on a pair of Google Glass and scrubs in. From the moment she makes her first incision, a live video feed of the operation is streamed from her glasses to a surgeon outside the operating room who gives live feedback over earbuds. Training medical professionals is just one of the many workplace uses Google Glass is experimenting with. Earlier this year, Google launched its Glass at Work certification program, in which it collaborates with businesses interested in using Glass to improve productivity and save money. Ten companies have signed on so far. Google's head-mounted computer is almost two years old, but the product is still officially in beta. Glass was originally marketed only as a consumer device, but it has had difficulty finding a niche in the consumer market, where it struggled with privacy, etiquette and safety issues. But then some of Glass' early adopters put the wearable to work, using the device to make their jobs more efficient. Some of the most exciting potential for wearables is in the health industry, where workers need to keep their hands sterile. The small screen mounted on Glass can be used to display checklists or vital signs. Smart glasses can also let specialists consult on cases far from their hospital. This type of telemedicine has been around for years, but high costs and regulation have made widespread adoption difficult. ""Having the units like Glass or any sort of wearable first-person display that comes in at less than $1,500 really opens things up,"" said Dr. Warren Wiechmann, who heads up the Glass tests at the University of California at Irvine. UC Irvine is partnering with app developer Pristine, a Google Glass partner, to experiment with Glass in a number of case studies. In addition to using it as training wheels for medical students, the school is putting Glass on surgeons so they can broadcast operations live to students. Patient actors will wear Glass while medical students learn how to do a basic exam. Later, the students are shown the video to see themselves though a patient's eyes, with the idea of improving bedside manner, empathy and listening skills. Google is being slow and deliberate with the business partners it certifies. It vets each company to see if its specific use case solves a problem in the real world, and gives them access to technical experts. For now, the company is focusing on workers who need to use their hands for their jobs, everyone from nurses and surgeons to mechanics, utility workers and chefs. Google says 80% of the global workforce does physical work every day. ""These are people who can't reach into their pocket to pull out a cell phone, they can't type on a laptop,"" said Chris O'Neill, head of business for Google Glass. ""They have every need to access information, every need to use tech to make their jobs that much more safe and productive."" When an expensive printer breaks down, an expert is typically sent to make repairs in person. In another Google Glass test case, HP is experimenting with keeping the experts at home. Instead, a customer puts on a pair of Glass and the repair person walks them through the necessary fixes remotely. Wearables in the workplace are still in the very early stages. Google and other similar companies are primarily focused on test cases and proving that there is a tangible benefit to the technology. Before smart glasses go mainstream, there are also a number of issues that need to be addressed, including getting old industries up to date with new technology, bringing fast Internet coverage to industrial work locations, and improving device battery life. And of course, privacy concerns won't disappear once a wearable is worn to work instead of to a bar. Employees might have concerns about being monitored and tracked on the job with wearables. Google has the time and resources to tackle these issues as they come up. Down the line, wearables like Glass could be commonplace on oil rigs, in the exam room, up telephone towers and even in fast food restaurants. Taco Bell is considering using Glass to train new employees on the proper cheese-to-bean ratios. Yum Brands, the parent company of Taco Bell and KFC, has worked with Google Glass app developer Interapt on test cases to see if Glass can cut down on the time it takes to train new employees. Glass uses location information and a specific training app to walk them through the steps for preparing food in real time. ""They're not just reading a book about making tacos, they're actually doing it."" said Interapt CEO Ankur Gopal.","Companies are experimenting with Google Glass in the workplace .

"For decades, Johannesburg has suffered from an image problem. Rising crime in the 1990s saw the flight of capital from the central city, with companies relocating their offices to the suburbs and the area becoming a ghost town after dark. Johannesburg became an international case study in urban decay. But in recent years, South Africa's largest city has been undergoing a rebirth. Thanks to a wave of young entrepreneurs bringing new life to the downtown real estate, hospitality and entertainment scenes, Johannesburg is gradually reinventing itself as the edgy, modern and diverse face of urban South Africa. Adam Levy is a property developer who was born and bred in the city, variously known as Jo'burg, Jozi and eGoli. After traveling the world in his early 20s, he returned home in 2003 with a vision of bringing some of New York's hip designer living to his home town. See also: Young, urban and savvy: Meet the Afropolitans . Rather than looking to make a home in the city's desirable northern suburbs, where many residents of the city set their sights, Levy focused on creating desirable new spaces in the city's downtown, which for many residents had become a no-go area. In an old office building, he developed architecturally-designed apartments sought after by young professionals -- where he lives today. Read also: Dada Masilo, breaking all the rules . ""It was right next to the railway track, which most people had a total aversion about. No one wanted to live here and people were going 'Adam, you must be out of your mind. What would compel you to do that?'"" But the building had clear potential. ""Who in their right mind wouldn't want to have a view like this? That, for me, was the catalyst (for) believing that people would want to live downtown, would want to be in an environment like this."" Levy's other projects include transforming a run-down warehouse into a hub of creative businesses. But reviving the city's urban zones was not just a case of repurposing old buildings, he said: It was about creating a different mindset. ""You've got to believe that you can change in the first instance... You've got to go out there and actively try and make a process of modifying the way people function,"" he said. ""I don't believe in the culture of 50-foot walls and big electric fences. I think you can engender a different way of engaging with people."" He said the city was beginning to ""find its feet,"" despite its troubled recent past. ""Too many of the bad stories make their way to mainstream media, so a lot of people have this negative perception of what's happening in Johannesburg,"" he said. ""The things that are good make up 90% of the stories, I can assure you."" As crime gradually drops in Johannesburg, dining and entertainment precincts are springing into life. Ziggy Thabethe is a successful restaurant and bar owner, who said he tried to capture some of the spirit of the city during the thriving 1970s at his establishments. ""The city was once very vibrant, if you go back into time,"" he said. Although the majority of the population was suffering under apartheid, ""they were still able to say, 'Wow, let's go out and have some fun.'"" ""The offices were (open) and the city was pumping, and people used to come into the city for good meals."" With money beginning to be reinvested in Johannesburg, people are starting to become more confident about heading out for an evening in the city again. ""I'm glad I've been able to attract a very diverse market in terms of my bars,"" he said. ""It will be Indians, Chinese, blacks and whites. It's very...rainbow nation."" It's not just locals who are noticing the difference. Johannesburg resident Masego Maponyane said the city's new lease of life meant that visitors were no longer treating it as simply a transit point on the way to other destinations. ""Foreign tourists are ... coming here in their droves, and they're absolutely loving it,"" he said. ""(It's) no longer a bit of a taboo or risky thing to come here.""

"During the half century since President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, you may have heard about a few conspiracy theories. Decades of investigations, hearings, documents, records, books and interviews have failed to satisfy conspiracy theorists with a definitive answer to The Question: Did Lee Harvey Oswald act alone when he shot the President? At one time or another, doubters of the lone gunman theory ""have accused 42 groups, 82 assassins and 214 people of being involved in the assassination,"" said author Vincent Bugliosi. That's a lot of paranoia. So, when reporters, producers, or amateur historians are looking to check out the latest JFK conspiracy theory, they call Dave Perry. ""People think I'm an anti-conspiracy guy,"" Perry said recently at his Dallas-area home. But there's one theory that he's not ruling out. We'll get to that in a minute. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists, Perry said, come in all degrees of interest and levels of obsession. They may believe that the government was behind the 9/11 attacks or that the moon landings were fake. Those folks comprise the ""off the wall"" crowd. The others, he says, read the books, watch the documentaries and come to less extreme conclusions. Related:  Secretary Kerry thinks JFK assassin had help . Ahead of last November's 50th anniversary of the assassination, a flood of books about the tragedy were re-released, along with the publication of new books examining various conspiracies. The king of Kennedy conspiracy films, Oliver Stone's ""JFK,"" has also was re-released on disc. Related: Why Oliver Stone thinks it was a conspiracy . Conspiracy theorists have been gathering to compare notes at special symposiums, like one last year at Pittsburgh's Duquesne University.  The event, which included Stone as a panelist, seemed more like a revival meeting at a Sunday house of worship than an academic conference, according to a reporter who was there.  ""Replace 'Amen' for 'That's right!' and it would have basically been a church,"" recalled Rebecca Nuttall. Nuttall said the crowd ranged from those who believed the government was involved in some kind of cover-up, to extremists who appeared to think ""everything the government tells you is a lie."" She said many still blame the media for failing to uncover the truth. And Perry, a 70-year-old retired former insurance claims adjuster from Massachusetts, has been digging through JFK assassination records since 1976 to address those skeptics. Doubters ask him to check out the odd stories that pop up: Somebody claimed to be the Grassy Knoll shooter. Nope, he wasn't. Perry says he located and verified the authenticity of Oswald's long-lost wedding ring. ""I don't do the sexy stuff,"" Perry said. ""I don't come out and say, 'I know who the Grassy Knoll assassin is!' I'm the guy that goes into the county records building and looks up deed records. Most people don't get too wound up over that."" Related: Still paranoid after all these years . Over the years he's come to know several people who found themselves embroiled in the investigation, including ex-Dallas detective Jim Leavelle and Oswald's co-worker Buell Frazier. Perry guesses he spends a ""couple hundred hours"" each October and November doing research and consulting. After all that, you can imagine he's heard a lot of theories. The School Book Depository where Oswald shot Kennedy is now the Sixth Floor Museum, featuring exhibits surrounding the tragedy. ""The conspiracy theories are still around because people don't know what to believe,"" said museum curator Gary Mack, who admits he's ""not satisfied with the official story."" If Oswald didn't act alone, who was behind the shooting in Dallas's Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963? Some conspiracy theorists believe ""the oil people"" may have organized a hit on the President; others suspect ""people who didn't like the way Kennedy handled civil rights."" Perry shared five conspiracy theories he believes rank among the most popular: . 1. ""LBJ had it done"" Perry has shot this one down. ""It's based primarily on statements made by Madeleine Brown,"" who Perry described as a ""crackpot.""  Brown -- who died in 2002 -- claimed to have had an affair with Johnson. She also claimed that LBJ had attended a party with ex-Vice President Richard Nixon, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and others the night before the attack. According to Perry, Brown said LBJ whispered into her ear, ""After tomorrow, those Kennedys will never embarrass me again. That's no threat. That's a promise."" ""That's absolutely not true,"" said Perry, who said his research proved LBJ couldn't have been at the alleged party that night, debunking Brown's story. ""A lot of Texans didn't like Johnson -- they thought he was a crook -- so as a result, they started creating this fiction after the assassination where he wanted Kennedy out so he could be president,"" Perry said. ""But we've found no evidence, and we know that all the stuff that Madeleine Brown said was contrived."" 2. The ""military industrial complex"" did it . Nope, that doesn't wash either, said Perry. ""The claim is that Kennedy was going to pull (American) troops out of Vietnam (and that) the military wanted to pour more people into Vietnam. That's technically not correct. He talked about trying to resolve the situation, but he never made a claim that he was going to pull out of there."" 3. ""The mob"" did it . Sorry, said Perry, no veracity to that. ""There's at least three different groups that they claim independently did this: There's the Chicago mob, the Miami mob, and the New Orleans mob. But it's all hearsay."" 4. ""Oswald acted alone as part of an unknown conspiracy"" It's possible there were individuals who helped Oswald, but who weren't part of any larger group or perhaps unaware of what he was planning. ""Remember John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln and four were hung, including the first woman ever to be hung (by the federal government,) Mary Surratt,"" he said. 5. ""The CIA did it"" This is the conspiracy theory that interests Perry the most. ""The problem is, of all of them, this is one I can't debunk,"" he laughs. ""Supposedly Kennedy was fed up with the shenanigans that the CIA was pulling,"" Perry said. ""He found out the CIA was trying to kill (Cuban leader Fidel) Castro, which is a fact. So the argument is that the CIA felt that Kennedy was going to disband them. And as a result of that, they were the ones that ordered the killing of Kennedy."" Perry points out that a former head of the CIA, Allen Dulles, was a member of the Warren Commission, the special Johnson-appointed panel tasked with the official investigation of the assassination. The commission determined that Oswald acted alone. Oswald was a supporter of Soviet-backed Cuba. ""We know Oswald was in the Russian embassy in Mexico City,"" Perry said. ""We even know who he talked to. But we don't know what was said. Then a few weeks later, he shoots Kennedy."" ""It may have been something that they overheard involving him and the Russians. Or, maybe the CIA had Oswald on the payroll. He might have been a double agent."" Is it possible that Russians ordered Oswald to do it? Not likely, said Perry. The Russians would never have ordered Oswald to kill Kennedy because of his well-known links to Russia and his pro-Cuban sympathies. Russia's leaders knew they would have been the first suspects if they'd engineered an assassination by Oswald. It would have been an act of war, which could have triggered a nuclear attack. ""We need to know what happened in Mexico City,"" Perry said. The answer, he said, may be contained in still-classified CIA documents. The U.S. National Archives currently holds a number of unreleased CIA documents related to the assassination. Those papers are scheduled to be made public in 2017 as part of the 1992 Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. ""CIA has followed the provisions of the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act, and the National Archives has all of the agency's documents and files on the Kennedy assassination,"" said CIA spokesman Edward Price. ""The classified information contained in the files remains subject to the declassification provisions of the Act."" So, either we already know the truth, Oswald acted alone, or -- worst-case scenario -- we may never know the whole truth, prompting one more question surrounding the killing of JFK: Would America be OK with that?

"(CNN) -- On a cold morning in February, 10 days after undergoing in vitro fertilization, Carolyn Savage lay in bed at her Ohio home waiting for the results of her pregnancy test. Sean and Carolyn Savage with daughter Mary Kate (now 18 months) and sons Ryan, left, and Andrew. Time was moving slowly. It was getting late and the call from the fertility clinic should have come by lunchtime. ""We were waiting and waiting and the call seemed like it would never come,"" Savage said. Finally, around 4 p.m., Carolyn's husband, Sean, got the call at work. ""The doctor told me in one sentence, 'Carolyn is pregnant, but we transferred the wrong embryos,'"" he said. ""I didn't even know that could physically happen. It was a total shock, totally beyond the realm of possibility."" In a tragic mix-up, the Savages say the fertility clinic where Carolyn underwent in vitro fertilization implanted another couple's embryos into Carolyn's uterus. In essence, she had become an unwitting surrogate for another family. After receiving the news, Sean hung up the phone and drove straight home to tell his wife in person. ""He walked in and was as white as a sheet,"" Carolyn said. ""He told me, and I think he repeated himself two or three times, and I kept saying 'You're joking.' I kept yelling at him stop it but there was nothing on his face indicating a joke.""  Watch more on the Savages and their reaction to their situation » . Incredulity turned to shock, and when that shock melted, so did the couple's hope for having another child of their own. At the time, Carolyn was 39 and her chances of having a child naturally after this one were waning. ""That was the beginning of a very treacherous and emotional journey for us,"" said Sean. ""I don't think I've ever cried so much in my life,"" said Carolyn. ""It was such a nightmare and, in a way, I felt violated."" That nightmare was the tipping point on a pregnancy path marred by failed attempts and painful miscarriages. Only the birth of the Savages' first child was easy. Their second child, born almost three years later in 1997, was 10 weeks premature after Carolyn developed life-threatening complications. ""That was a scary time for us,"" said Carolyn. Yet after she recovered, the Savages consulted with a doctor and remained intent on pursuing future pregnancies. It would prove exceedingly difficult. Carolyn and Sean tried on and off for 10 years to have another child before turning to IVF. Eventually, Carolyn became pregnant with the couple's third child, resulting in another difficult pregnancy and premature birth. Their daughter is now a healthy 18-month-old. With five embryos left over from IVF -- and despite the risks to Carolyn's health -- the Savages, guided by their religious beliefs, refused to let the unused embryos at the clinic languish. February 6 was when they thought they had three of their own embryos implanted by the fertility clinic. Cases like these, while tragic, are exceedingly rare, said Dr. David Adamson, a reproductive endocrinologist and past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ""There are well in excess of 100,000 embryo transfers every year in this country,"" said Adamson. ""The fact that this happens once in several hundred thousand embryo transfers means the vast majority of the time, systems do protect from this taking place."" Groups like the ASRM have a series of strong protocol recommendations for in vitro procedures, such as accurately labeling embryos with the patient's name and Social Security number, and color-coding samples uniquely to avoid confusion. These identification procedures are not legally mandated, but mistakes can occur if they are not followed, said Adamson. After learning about the mistake, the Savages made two decisions right away: They would not abort the baby, and when he was born, they would relinquish the baby to his DNA parents. ""They didn't choose this path either,"" Carolyn Savage said of the DNA parents, who declined to speak with media. ""We knew if our embryo had been thawed and negligently put into another woman, we would expect that the child would be returned to us."" The Savages are not releasing the name of the clinic where they underwent the IVF procedure, but provided CNN with proof of their reproductive predicament, including results of amniocentesis, a genetic test, indicating the baby Carolyn is carrying is not  theirs. They have met with the baby's DNA parents, and according to Carolyn the DNA-related mother of the child has come along for one doctor's appointment. ""We knew based on legal precedent that custody would be lost, and we agree with that precedent,"" said Carolyn, alluding to a similar case of errant IVF in 1999 in New York in which custody was awarded to the genetic parents. The Savages are grimly aware that they will have to do the same thing soon. Carolyn is now 35 weeks pregnant and expecting to deliver within the next couple of weeks. It is a countdown fraught with mixed emotions. ""As the process has gone along, it has been exceptionally difficult imagining this playing out,"" Sean Savage said. ""There are so many ways to walk into that delivery room,"" Carolyn. ""We're trying to mentally frame it instead of a loss -- it is a loss, I don't want to say that it isn't -- but we're trying to look at it as a gift we're giving someone else."" The Savages say the five embryos they originally had cryogenically preserved at the clinic in Ohio are still unused and have been moved to another clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. They say doctors have advised against any more pregnancies for Carolyn, so they are working out terms with a gestational carrier, or surrogate, to carry some of those embryos for them. Still, even if a surrogate can eventually help them expand their family, the Savages say that the memory of the child they gave up will always linger. ""I know that tug will be there every day wondering if the baby's happy, healthy and OK,"" said Carolyn. ""We want him to know that it wasn't that we didn't want him, but too many people wanted him,"" said Sean. ""We gave him up because it was the right thing to do.""","A fertility clinic implanted the wrong embryos in an in vitro procedure .

"In February, Esquire magazine published a lengthy profile of ""The Man Who Killed Osama bin Laden."" The story did not identify the killer by his real name, referring to him only as ""the Shooter."" The Shooter told Esquire he encountered al Qaeda's leader face-to-face in the top-floor bedroom of the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where he'd been hiding for more than five years. The Shooter said the al Qaeda leader was standing up and had a gun ""within reach"" and it was only then that the Shooter fired  two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him.  That account was in conflict with the narrative from another raid participant in a wildly successful book, ""No Easy Day."" Now, another member of the secretive SEAL Team 6, which executed the bin Laden raid, tells CNN the story of the Shooter as presented in Esquire is false. According to this serving SEAL Team 6 operator, the story is ""complete B-S."" Watch more: Peter Bergen examines the differing accounts on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" SEAL Team 6 operators are now in ""serious lockdown"" when it comes to ""talking to anybody"" about the bin Laden raid and say they have been frustrated to see what they consider to be the inaccurate story in Esquire receive considerable play without a response.  Phil Bronstein, who wrote the 15,000-word piece about the Shooter for Esquire, was booked on CNN, Fox and many other TV networks after his story came out. Twenty-three SEALs and their interpreter launched the assault on the bin Laden compound just after midnight on the morning of May 2, 2011. They shot and killed bin Laden's two bodyguards, one of bin Laden's sons and the wife of one of the bodyguards, and wounded two other women. The first three SEALs to make it to the top floor of the compound were ""the point man,"" ""the Shooter"" profiled by Esquire, and Matt Bissonette, the SEAL who wrote ""No Easy Day"" under the pseudonym Mark Owen. What actually happened the night of the raid, according to the SEAL Team 6 operator who I interviewed, is that the ""point man"" ran up the stairs to the top floor and shot bin Laden in the head when he saw what looked like bin Laden poking his head out of his bedroom door. The shot gravely wounded al Qaeda's leader. Having taken down bin Laden, the point man proceeded to rush two women he found in the bedroom, gathering them in his arms to absorb the explosion in case they were wearing suicide vests, something that was a real concern of those who planned the raid. 'Nightmare' at home for SEAL who shot Osama bin Laden . Two more SEALs then entered bin Laden's bedroom and, seeing that the al Qaeda leader was lying mortally wounded on the floor, finished him off with shots to the chest. This account of bin Laden's demise is considerably less heroic than the Shooter's version in Esquire, in which he says he shot bin Laden while he was standing up and only after he saw that the al Qaeda leader had a gun within reach. The SEAL Team 6 operator who spoke to me says there is no way the Shooter could have seen a gun in bin Laden's reach because the two guns that were found in the bedroom after the shooting were only discovered after a thorough search and were sitting on a high shelf above the frame of the door that opened to the room. SEAL commander rebuts 'Shooter' claim . The SEAL operator also points out there was a discussion before the raid in which the assault team was told ""don't shoot the guy (bin Laden) in the face unless you have to"" because the CIA would need to analyze good pictures of bin Laden's face for its facial recognition experts to work effectively. Yet the Shooter in the Esquire story says he shot bin Laden on purpose twice in the forehead. A U.S. official familiar with the details of the raid said the SEAL Team 6 operator's version is in line with what happened.  That  account ""has it right in my view,"" the official said. Watch computer animation of the different accounts . The SEAL Team 6 operator also tells CNN that the Shooter was ""thrown off"" the Red Squadron, the core of the SEAL Team 6 group that carried out the bin Laden raid, because he was bragging about his role in the raid in bars around Virginia Beach, Virginia, where SEAL Team 6 is based.  In the Esquire article, the Shooter complains he is receiving no pension, since he left the military four years before the minimum 20 years required to be eligible. CNN spoke with Bronstein, the Esquire writer, who says he passed on CNN's written questions about the Shooter's role in the raid to his story's main character. The Shooter has not responded to those questions, and Bronstein declined to be interviewed on-the-record for this story. Stephanie Tuck, a spokeswoman for Esquire, said via e-mail the magazine stands by its story. ""The Esquire article, 'The Shooter: The Man Who Killed Osama Bin Laden,' in the March 2013 issue, is based on information from numerous sources, including members of SEAL Team 6 and the Shooter himself, as well as detailed descriptions of mission debriefs."" More questions were raised about the Esquire story's version of events Monday on SOFREP, a website that covers the Special Operations community.  The queries came from former Navy SEAL Brandon Webb in a posting entitled, ""Esquire Is Screwed: Duped By Fake UBL 'Shooter.'"" 2011: SEALs who killed bin Laden concerned for their safety . According to present and former members of SEAL Team 6, the ""point man"" who fired the shot that likely mortally wounded bin Laden will never ""in a million years"" speak publicly about his role in the raid, and they lauded his courageous decision to throw himself on the two women in bin Laden's room. The new account of the bin Laden raid provided by the serving SEAL Team 6 operator is essentially the same as in Bissonnette's ""No Easy Day."" Bissonnette says he was one of the first to run into the bedroom and he saw that the point man's shots had mortally wounded bin Laden.  Bissonette says he then shot the dying al Qaeda leader as he lay on the floor. Present and former members of SEAL Team 6 say they regard Bissonnette as more credible than the Shooter. Balanced against that, according to a story filed by CNN's Barbara Starr last year, after the publication of ""No Easy Day,"" the head of U.S. special operations, Adm. William McRaven, contacted members of the Navy SEAL team that killed bin Laden. According to Pentagon officials, the SEALs said bin Laden was standing in his bedroom when he was shot and they believed that he posed a threat because there were weapons in the room. This account tends to bolster the story the Shooter told Esquire. In a previous CNN.com story about the Esquire profile, I noted that I was the only outside observer allowed to tour bin Laden's Abbottabad compound before it was demolished in late February 2012. During that tour, I looked around the bedroom where bin Laden was killed. The Pakistani military officers who were guiding me pointed out a patch of dark, dried blood on the low ceiling of bin Laden's bedroom.  This patch of congealed blood seems to be consistent with the Shooter's story that he fired two shots at the forehead of a ""surprisingly tall terrorist"" while he was standing up.  At the time, the precise location of bin Laden when he was shot was not a matter of dispute. But the blood patch could also be consistent with the account that it was the ""point man"" who first shot bin Laden. The point man is 5 feet 6 inches tall and was shooting upward at a tall man as he poked his head out of his bedroom. 2011: Obama meets bin Laden raiders, promises victory over al Qaeda . The compound is, of course, now gone, so it is no longer possible to reconstruct what happened the night of the raid based on forensic evidence, although it is possible the Abbottabad Commission, a panel that was appointed by the Pakistani government to look into the raid, could shed some light on this question should its findings ever be publicly released. Finally, by all accounts, it was a confusing situation the night of the raid. One of the SEAL team's helicopters had crashed and there was a firefight with one of bin Laden's bodyguards. All the electricity in the compound and the surrounding neighborhood was off on a moonless night and the SEALs were all wearing night vision goggles, which only allowed them limited vision. What seems incontrovertible is that the point man, the Shooter and Bissonnette were the first three SEALs to assault bin Laden's bedroom. But to determine exactly which of them killed the al Qaeda leader may never be possible. What is certain is that it was a team effort. Five days after the bin Laden raid, members of the SEAL team who carried out the mission briefed President Barack Obama. According to those in the room, the SEAL team commander explained to the president, ""If you took one person out of the puzzle, we wouldn't have the competence to do the job we did; everybody's vital. It's not about the guy who pulled the trigger to kill bin Laden, it's about what we all did together."" Read more: Bergen: Trying Osama's son-in-law in NY makes sense .

"Rivalry? What rivalry? Late-night talk show hosts Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon, who've been pitted against each other as rumors fly that NBC is mulling a changing of the guard, made light of their situation Monday night, by belting a show tune together. ""Tonight, tonight, who's going to host 'Tonight?' Is it going to be Jimmy or Jay?"" the pair sang in a parody of ""Tonight"" from the Broadway musical ""West Side Story."" The rumor mill has Fallon, 38, taking over 62-year-old Leno's job as host of NBC's ""Tonight Show,"" and Leno has responded with pointed barbs at his employer that have seen his ratings rise. ""In the news, they say I'm replacing you, they think that I can woo, the demo,"" Fallon sang. Leno responsed: ""So the network says, here's an idea: pack your bags, take a hike, NBC-ya!"" We're still friends, right? The carefully choreographed bit capped a day-long NBC promotional blitz that included a 30-second teaser video on Fallon's YouTube channel. A beleaguered Leno exits the ""Tonight Show"" set in Los Angeles at the beginning of the four-minute skit, hounded by reporters asking him if the rumors of his demise are true. Meanwhile in New York, a pensive-looking Fallon,surrounded by speculative press clippings in his dressing room, gets a call from Leno. ""Hey kid, how you holding up?"" ""Okay, I guess,"" Fallon answers. ""You?"" ""I'll live. I've been through this before you know,"" Leno deadpans. ""I've got to admit I'm getting sick of all this."" Looking for reassurance, Fallon says: ""Jay, can I ask you something? We're still friends, right?"" Leno: ""Of course we're still friends."" Cue the orchestra . Confidence restored, Fallon breaks into song -- quickly followed by Leno -- with all the subtlety of, well, a show tune. Although the bit had the apparent blessing of the network, there were no sacred cows. Leno brags of his ratings, now at a seven-week high, even as NBC may be plotting to usher him off the air in favor of Fallon's appeal to younger demographic groups. Talk about another network that might want to pick up a successful talk show host?  Sure. ""I've got Fox on the line,"" Leno croons. Maybe the comedians hate each other.  Maybe they don't. The entertainment press  sure likes to pit the funnymen against each other. But doesn't music make things better? ""Tonight, tonight, why do they say we fight?"" the pair sang. ""I like you.  You you like me.  We're okay."" Convinced? A bit of controversy . Rumors about Fallon supplanting Leno have been swirling since mid-March, when The New York Times' Bill Carter reported that the network has made a commitment to Fallon in regards to him succeeding Leno. Yet according to Carter, Fallon's future as the new host of ""Tonight"" isn't a done deal as much as it's an understanding. ""There's no deal yet for the timetable of this, they have an understanding,"" Carter told CNN's Jake Tapper last month ""I'm sure Jay knows about the understanding. But Jay has a contract that goes until the fall of next year. I think from Jay's point of view, he will work until they tell him to stop. That's the way he is; that's the kind of guy he is."" Still, the idea of Fallon getting the show isn't a surprise, at least, not as much as the report that the show will move back to New York from California. ""There's a lot of reasons for it. I think they all feel that the energy of New York helps Fallon,"" Carter said. ""But also you have Lorne Michaels, who's the producer of the show, and has always been close to Jimmy, and he's of course New York-based. ""And then you have the band, The Roots, and The Roots are a Philadelphia-based band, and some of the guys I think still commute to New York, and they're very important to that show and I don't think they wanted to lose them."" The punchline . If the musical skit proves anything, Leno and Fallon haven't lost their sense of humor under the scrutiny of the future of the ""Tonight Show."" They even couched it with a dose of reality. In a pseudo-operatic climax, the pair asks: . ""Tonight, tonight, who cares who hosts 'Tonight?' ""People just watch online the next day.""","Comedians poke fun at rivalry in Broadway-style song .

"The Ebola news keeps pouring in. Two nurses who treated the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States are in isolation. A nursing assistant in Spain who contracted the disease has been declared free of the virus. Health officials have cleared many of the people who came in contact with Texas patient Thomas Eric Duncan after monitoring their temperatures for 21 days. As these facts and more are revealed, here's what you need to know about the deadly virus and what's being done to stop its spread: . What are the symptoms of Ebola? Symptoms include fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, internal bleeding and stomach pain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the average time it takes for symptoms to appear after infection is eight to 10 days. With all these cases in the U.S., should I be worried? Ebola is difficult to catch. You would only be at risk if you came into close contact with the blood, saliva, sweat, feces, semen, vomit or soiled clothing of an Ebola patient, or if you had traveled to the impacted areas in West Africa and came into contact with someone who had Ebola. For example, as of midnight Sunday, 43 of the 48 people who had contact with Duncan while he was symptomatic were cleared by health officials; they no longer have to endure twice-daily temperature checks after reaching the 21-day incubation mark. Officials said the others on the list will be cleared shortly if no symptoms appear. Why 21 days? The CDC says it can take up to 21 days for symptoms of Ebola to appear, so someone can be infected with the virus and not yet know that he or she is sick. Health officials monitor potential patients for that long before declaring them safe. A blood test can only be positive for Ebola once symptoms appear. There is some controversy over this number. Charles Haas, who published a study last week on the topic, looked at past outbreaks and found there was a 12% chance of people becoming symptomatic after the official 21-day period. ""I think (the incubation period) probably should be longer,"" Haas told CNN. ""There needs to be more of a dialogue between the scientific and medical community and the policymakers on deciding what that appropriate level should be."" So what is the 42-day period I keep hearing about? The World Health Organization declares countries free of Ebola transmission after 42 days. When a country believes it has an outbreak under control, it must show there are no new cases during that 42-day period. Basically, WHO doubles the 21-day incubation period of the virus to ensure no new infections are happening. Have any countries in West Africa stopped the Ebola virus? Yes. WHO has declared both Senegal, which had one case, and Nigeria, 19 confirmed cases and one probable, free of Ebola virus transmission. Unfortunately, the number of cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is still growing. The current outbreak is considered the largest in world history -- with more than 9,100 cases and 4,500 deaths due to Ebola. Are U.S. airports screening for Ebola patients? Out of an abundance of caution, five of America's biggest and busiest airports are going to do special screenings -- including taking the temperature of anyone who has come from an Ebola-affected country -- to keep the disease from spreading further in the United States. The CDC is going to monitor travelers for any sign of illness and will ask a series of questions about their exposure to Ebola patients. Travelers with symptoms will be isolated and those who are symptom-free will get information about how to watch for possible signs of the virus. Authorities at the UK's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as Eurostar railway terminals, also will begin screening passengers arriving from Ebola-affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. How did this outbreak start? It probably started with a 2-year old patient in a village in Guinea.  The toddler died December 6, 2013, according to a report published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Scientists don't know how the toddler got it, but the virus can spread from animals to humans through infected bodily fluids. It has been spread through infected chimps, gorillas, monkeys, fruit bats, porcupines and forest antelope, according to WHO. Is that why Spanish officials euthanized an Ebola patient's dog? Health officials in Madrid were concerned that the dog, Excalibur, might carry the virus because its owner -- a nurse's aide who treated an Ebola patient in Spain -- was diagnosed with the disease.  Despite a ""Save Excalibur"" petition campaign, which was signed by about 400,000 people, the dog was put to sleep. Yet in Dallas, Nina Pham's Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Bentley, was simply put in quarantine, so there are alternatives to euthanization. Should I worry about my own dog? Studies on a dog-to-human transmission of the virus are not conclusive. In the 2001-2002 outbreak in Gabon, scientists found signs of the virus in 25% of the dogs living near the outbreak. The animals were not symptomatic, nor did they die during the time the scientists were studying them. ""The only conclusion that may be safely drawn from this study is that the animals encountered Ebola virus (and their immune systems responded),"" Margaret H. Gilbert, a clinical veterinarian and assistant professor of medicine at Tulane National Primate Research Center, wrote in an email to CNN. ""Whether or not dogs shed Ebola once their immune systems encounter it remains to be seen."" ""Asymptomatically infected dogs could be a potential source of human Ebola outbreaks,"" scientists who studied the 2001 outbreak wrote. The CDC is working with the American Veterinary Medical Association and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to develop guidance for the U.S. pet population, but the CDC says the likelihood that U.S. pets will pass Ebola on to Americans is slim. What if I have a cat? The Ebola virus has been found in other animals, but to date there have been no documented infections in cats. Is there a cure? Not yet, but scientists are scrambling to find one. A drug called ZMapp was given to two Americans who contracted the disease in Liberia and were brought to Emory University in Atlanta for treatment in August. They recovered fully, and the medication seemed to play a role in that recovery, but there are no more doses of that drug. The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency has provided funding to Mapp Biopharmaceutical so it can conduct more early-stage clinical trials on the drug right now. A drug called TKM-Ebola was used on another American patient who was treated in Nebraska, Dr. Richard Sacra. That  drug, manufactured by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, showed some promise, and the Food and Drug Administration gave it a fast-track designation to speed up the testing process.  The biopharmaceutical company Chimerix got approval for the emergency use of its drug, Brincidofovir, for Duncan in Texas. He did not get the experimental medicine immediately. The National Institutes of Health also started human testing on a vaccine in September, and another vaccine developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada -- licensed to Iowa-based NewLink Genetics -- is about to start clinical trials. Complete Ebola coverage . How many more people will get sick? The CDC predicts as many as 550,000 to 1.4 million people could be infected with Ebola by January.  That calculation was based on figures from September, before the United States sent additional help to West Africa. The CDC estimates that if 70% of the people with Ebola are cared for properly, the epidemic could decrease and eventually end.","Two nurses who treated Thomas Eric Duncan are in isolation .

"When someone is being stiff and acting emotionless, we may have to quit calling them a robot. Softbank, a Japanese Internet and telecommunications company, introduced the world Thursday to Pepper, a robot designed to read, and respond to, its user's mood. ""People may look back 100 years later, or 200 years later (and say) that was a historic moment we are having today,"" said Masayoshi Son, Softbank's CEO, in a translated video on Softbank's website. Pepper stands about 4 feet tall and weighs just 62 pounds. At the event in Tokyo, the little humanoid offered a traditional Japanese bow to the crowd before chatting with Son, shaking hands and urging him to smile. Pepper gets feedback from its user via facial-recognition technology and a bank of cameras, audio recorders and sensors in its head. Softbank says that instead of being programmed, Pepper learns how to behave over time. Feedback is uploaded to cloud storage where it can be used by other units to modify the way they behave. The robots will tailor their interactions with users based on what mood they perceive. ""He tries to make you happy,"" Kaname Hayashi, Softbank's project manager, told CNN. Pepper has fully articulated arms and hands but no legs, rolling on a base that looks something like the bottom of a sleek, white vacuum cleaner. There's a tablet-like display mounted on the robot's chest for communicating. It's programmed to speak 17 languages. Softbank's Son, who also is chairman of Sprint Mobile, said the company envisions a future when household robots are commonplace and used for tasks ranging from simple companionship to tending to the sick and elderly.

"Arizona's Legislature has passed a controversial bill that would allow business owners, as long as they assert their religious beliefs, to deny service to gay and lesbian customers. The bill, which the state House of Representatives passed by a 33-27 vote Thursday, now goes to Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican and onetime small business owner who vetoed similar legislation last year but has expressed the right of business owners to deny service. ""I think anybody that owns a business can choose who they work with or who they don't work with,"" Brewer told CNN in Washington on Friday. ""But I don't know that it needs to be statutory. In my life and in my businesses, if I don't want to do business or if I don't want to deal with a particular company or person or whatever, I'm not interested. That's America. That's freedom."" As expected, the measure has drawn criticism from Democrats and business groups who said it would sanction discrimination and open the state to the risk of damaging litigation. On Friday, the LGBT group Wingspan staged a protest march to the governor's office that drew about 200 people. Some carried signs with messages ""God created us all equal"" and ""Shame on Arizona."" Tucson-based Rocco's Little Chicago Pizzeria posted a photo on its Facebook page of a sign with a message for state lawmakers: ""We reserve the right to refuse service to Arizona legislators."" ""It's a ridiculous bill,"" pizzeria manager Evan Stevens told CNN on Friday.  ""Arizona has much bigger problems than allowing businesses to discriminate against people."" In a statement, Anna Tovar, the state senate Democratic minority leader, said: ""With the express consent of Republicans in this Legislature, many Arizonans will find themselves members of a separate and unequal class under this law because of their sexual orientation. This bill may also open the door to discriminate based on race, familial status, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability."" The Greater Phoenix Economic Council, in a letter to Brewer on Friday, urged the governor to veto Senate Bill 1062, saying the ""legislation will likely have profound, negative effects on our business community for years to come."" ""The legislation places businesses currently in Arizona, as well as those looking to locate here, in potentially damaging risk of litigation, and costly, needless legal disputes,"" council President Barry Broome wrote, adding that four unidentified companies have vowed to locate elsewhere if the legislation is signed. He added, ""With major events approaching in the coming year, including Super Bowl XLIX, Arizona will be the center of the world's stage. This legislation has the potential of subjecting the Super Bowl, and major events surrounding it, to the threats of boycotts."" On CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" Arizona state Rep. John Kavanagh, a Republican, said the bill would not allow hotel clerks or waiters, for instance, to turn away customers, unless there was a ""substantial burden on their sincerely held religious beliefs."" The bill is being pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative group opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. The group has justified the measure on grounds that the proposal protects people against increasingly activist federal courts. ""As we witness hostility towards people of faith grow like never before, we must take this opportunity to speak up for religious liberty,"" the group said on its website, asking people to contact Brewer and urge her to sign the bill. ""The great news is that SB 1062 protects your right to live and work according to your faith."" Cathi Herrod, the center's president, told CNN on Friday, ""The Arizona bill has a very simple premise, that Americans should be free to live and work according to their religious faith. It's simply about protecting religious liberty and nothing else."" Herrod said the bill's opponents are ""showing unbelievable hostility toward religious beliefs."" ""America still stands for the principle that religious beliefs matter (for) something in this country, that we have the right to freely exercise our religious beliefs,"" she said. But Robert Boston, a spokesman for the Washington-based Americans United for Separation of Church and State, told CNN the legislation would ""fling the door wide open to discrimination, not just against gay people, but basically to any class of individuals that a religious fundamentalist decides he or she doesn't want to deal with."" He added, ""A woman who is pregnant out of wedlock, for example, 'Well, out the door, you don't get served in my business.' "" The Arizona legislation was passed as conservative states work to counter laws legalizing same-sex marriage. Arizona voters approved a ban on same-sex marriage as a state constitutional amendment in 2008. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona called the bill ""unnecessary and discriminatory."" ""What today's bill does is allow private individuals and businesses to use religion to discriminate, sending a message that Arizona is intolerant and unwelcoming,"" the group said in a statement. Some Republican legislators have defended the bill as  a First Amendment issue. Democrats dismissed it as an attack on gays and lesbians. ""It's a very bad day for Arizona,"" Rep. Chad Campbell, a Phoenix Democrat who voted against the legislation, told CNN Friday. He added, ""Let there be no doubt about what this bill does. It's going to allow people to discriminate against the gay community in Arizona. It goes after unprotected classes of people and we all know that the biggest unprotected class of people in the state is the LBGT community. If we were having this conversation in regard to African-Americans or women, there would be outrage across the country right now.""","Not sure this needs to be a law, governor tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- Thanks to several overreaching court cases, including the most well-known, the Supreme Court's disastrous Citizens United decision, the past five years have given us a whole new understanding of corporate power and its intersection with ""dark money"" political spending. The price tag for elections continues to steadily rise. Candidates and outside groups are closing in on $1 billion spent in the 2014 federal election cycle, and even worse, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, undisclosed money has made up $50 million of that spending. Luckily, the Securities and Exchange Commission could offer a way out of the darkness. A much-needed rulemaking petition to the SEC that would require public corporations to disclose their political spending to shareholders is receiving historic support. The petition has received a historic number of public comments: over 1 million as of last week. The SEC can and should act to protect investors and our democracy by creating this rule, which should be as comprehensive as possible, including direct campaign expenditures and gifts to conduit groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that play in politics. Hardly anyone need be told that the campaign finance landscape has changed dramatically in the past three elections. And a big part of that story is the corporate political spending that is laundered through dark money conduits, nonprofit organizations and trade associations repurposed into political spending juggernauts with the ability to keep their donors secret. Corporations with an aversion to disclosure have found these organizations to be the perfect vehicle for influencing elections and avoiding the wrath of consumers. Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a law professor and expert in this type of spending, commented (PDF), ""Corporate law is ill-prepared for this new age of corporate political spending by publicly traded companies. Today, corporate managers need not disclose to their investors -- individuals, mutual funds, or institutional investors such as government or union pension funds -- how funds from the corporate treasury are being spent, either before or after the fact."" And she's right. Although undisclosed corporate political spending has caused heartburn for transparency advocates and government watchdogs, another group of Americans has equal cause to fret: investors. Investing in the United States has expanded by leaps and bounds over the past few decades; today, more than 50 million Americans participate in 401(k) retirement savings plans through their employers. The 401(k) system holds more than $2.8 trillion belonging to current employees and retirees, so when we talk about investors, we are actually talking about the public, not an elite class of shareholders. Corporate political spending could jeopardize the retirement savings of millions of Americans. Gambling with a corporate brand through political spending is a high-stakes game for companies, for the people who depend on these companies to help them save, and the risks cannot be overstated. For many middle-class Americans, the savings in their 401(k) plans are all they have to ensure a comfortable and secure retirement. These people cannot afford to lose their nest eggs because a company decided to gamble its name and their money on a controversial political cause. In addition, when a CEO chooses to use corporate money to support causes or candidates, which may be antithetical to a given shareholder political views, in essence, he or she is substituting its judgment of what candidates an investing individual should support for that of their own. Shareholders have a right to know whether the companies they invest in are playing politics with their money, and the pending SEC rule could put that much-needed information in their hands. The SEC should immediately give priority to promulgating the rule requiring public corporations to disclose political spending. It can start by putting the petition back on the rulemaking agenda as well as by using its ongoing ""disclosure review"" process to recommend the rulemaking. As we begin to crest the wave of the next tsunami of dark and outside money of the 2014 cycle, the need for this type of transparency is blatantly apparent. This year, as we approach the five-year anniversary of the Citizens United decision, 1 million strong call on the SEC to act. Americans deserve to know who is bankrolling political advertisements, and shareholders need to know whether their investments are being wasted on politics rather than being spent on productive plans to build a better business.

"(CNN)  -- Canada reserved the best to last as its ice hockey heroes beat arch-rivals the United States 3-2 with an overtime goal from Sidney Crosby to claim the final gold of the Winter Olympics. Crosby, Canada's star player, broke American hearts with his goal seven minutes and 40 seconds into added time to give the hosts its 14th gold of a triumphant Vancouver Games. Canada looked headed for a comfortable victory as Jonathan Toews scored in the first period and teammate Corey Perry followed up to make it 2-0 early in the second. But Ryan Kesler pulled one back later in the second period to set up a frantic finale. Canada's much-vaunted Stanley Cup hero Crosby missed a breakaway chance to seal the gold for his side but with the clock counting down it seemed not to matter. That was until the United States threw caution to the wind and Zach Parise forced overtime with just 25 seconds remaining, his fourth goal of the Games for the previously unbeaten in five U.S. squad. The momentum now appeared to be with the United States, who had beaten Canada 5-3 in a preliminary round match. But they reckoned without Crosby, who had not been a significant factor in the final until he came good as he received a pass from Jarome Iginla and slid his winning shot under U.S. goaltender Ryan Miller. He was immediately mobbed by teammates who had finally lived up to the expectations of an ice hockey-mad nation. ""I just shot it,"" Crosby told gathered reporters.""It doesn't even feel real. It feels like a dream."" It's the first victory for a host country in Olympic ice hockey since the famous United States triumph at Lake Placid in 1980. But their 2010 counterparts were unable to match their golden feat and it clearly hurt. ""We only came here for one thing we wanted that gold medal, it's really a tough feeling right now. It stings you a lot, said Patrick Kane. The other gold decided on the 17th and final day of action in Vancouver went to Norway's Petter Northug who won the men's 50km cross country title. He beat Germany's Axel Teichmann in a two-up sprint with Johan Olsson of Sweden taking the bronze.","Sidney Crosby overtime goal gives Canada ice hockey gold at Winter Games .

"Ask 100 robotics scientists why they're inspired to create modern-day automatons and you may get 100 different answers. For a team at Harvard University, it's termites. ""Not the ones around here that destroy buildings, but the ones on other continents that build ... mounds more than 40 feet tall,"" said Justin Werfel, a staff scientist at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. ""Somehow, all of them working together can build these large-scale, complicated things."" The Harvard team members have created their own set of simple robots that they're trying to teach to emulate those termites. The result, so far, of the TERMES Project is a squad of autonomous robots that can be instructed to build towers, castles and pyramids out of foam bricks, then successfully negotiate their way around the things they create. It's part of a movement called ""swarm robotics,"" and it's pretty much the opposite of all the Terminators and Cylons that we've grown up with in the science-fiction realm. ""Typically, when you think of robotics, you think of one human-like, complicated robot,"" said Kristin Petersen, an academic fellow who spearheaded the design and construction of the TERMES robots. ""Instead, in swarm robotics, we're looking at large numbers of simple ones. Rather than a robot being like a human, it's more like a bunch of robots that are like an ant colony."" Or, you know, a termite colony. Petersen and Werfel said they both had independently thought about emulating mound-building termites, which live mainly in Africa, Australia and South America. READ: 10 pop-culture robots that shaped the future . The team has gone to Namibia twice to study the termites there and plans a third visit. The scientists say the current TERMES robots are a basic version of what they'd like to create once they have a better idea of how millions of termites work together on a single, massive project, sometimes long after the insects who started the construction are dead. The team's robots take cues from each other based on which parts of the job have already been finished. So, when one robot leaves, say, a brick in a particular location, that tells the next robot what needs to be done next. ""The power's in the swarm,"" Petersen said. ""The power is in not having a single point of failure because you have this one really advanced robot. The power is in sending out a bunch of robots that are really simple and hoping that some of them will succeed."" That's a key difference between TERMES and other swarm projects. Many others work more like an ant colony or beehive, with a single ""queen"" giving instructions to a team of underlings. In the long run, Werfel said, the TERMES system could be used on projects ""where we want construction done, but we don't want people to be the ones to do it."" That could be scenarios where it's difficult, expensive or dangerous to use human crews. ""If we wanted to have a Mars base and we could send a team of robots on ahead to build the habitat first, that's obviously a big advantage for the human astronauts who would show up later,"" he said. Of course, the team acknowledges that such lofty goals are a long way off. But in the nearer term, the scientists can see termite-inspired swarm robots being used for tasks like building dikes and piling sandbags during floods, keeping humans out of harm's way. ""If some of them get swept away by rising waters, none of the others need even take notice,"" Werfel said. ""They don't have to do anything differently. They just keep working."" Added Petersen: ""We're not intending to replace humans. We're intending to work in situations where humans can't work or it's impractical for them to work.""","Harvard researchers create ""swarm robotics"" construction crew .

"Human construction projects are generally centrally planned, with people in leadership roles supervising how everything is put together, and builders aware of the overall progress. But termites and other animals go about building in a different way, working independently. Each termite reacts directly to what it encounters, rather than having a preconceived notion of what to do. Collectively, the insects can create a mound much larger than themselves. ""They do all of their coordination indirectly, by changing their shared environment,"" says Justin Werfel of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. Werfel and colleagues used this model of decentralized, reactive building to create robots operating under those principles. Robots that behave this way could be useful for construction projects that would be too dangerous for humans, such as underwater research stations or in outer space. Another possible application would be building levees out of sandbags in flood zones, Werfel said. ""If you had a robot system to handle that kind of building automatically, that would let you keep people out of harm's way,"" Werfel said. The findings are published in the journal Science and presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting this week. These robots are small -- 4.7 inches high, with a footprint of about 4 x 7 inches. The ""bricks"" that they can manipulate, made of expanded urethane foam, are bigger than these critters: 8.5 x 8.5 x 2 inches. Researchers created algorithms governing the behavior of the robots, so that they know what to do when they encounter specific situations. It's not the blueprint that guides the robots, but rather these predefined simple rules. The construction begins with a single ""seed"" brick in a particular location. The robots can move forward, backward and turn in place.  They were designed to be able to climb up or down a step that is the height of one brick and build staircases with the bricks to get themselves higher up. Importantly, these robots only detect bricks and other robots that are in their immediate area; they have no idea how far along the overall structure is or what more distant robots are doing. Watch a YouTube video of the robots in action . ""Robots obtain information about where bricks have been attached only through direct inspection,"" researchers wrote. The design of the robots in this research wasn't intended to be ""cute,"" although they may appear that way -- some researchers call them ""frog-bots"" or ""squirrel-bots,"" said Kirsten Peterson, a co-author on the study. They have rounded features for the sake of simplicity and using less material. The robots have four types of sensors, Peterson said. A pattern-recognition system, composed of seven infrared sensors, can detect black and white patterns on the bricks and helps with navigation. In addition to tactile sensing, the robots have a pattern recognition system, an accelerometer to sense tilt, and five ultrasound sonar units to detect other robots and help maintain distance from the perimeter of the structure. To move around, the robots have wheel-legs called ""whegs."" This study did not optimize the robots for speed. It took three robots half an hour to build a ""trident"" structure with eight blocks, Peterson said. A decentralized system of robots has some advantages over a centrally planned method of building. If individuals perish, the plan doesn't fall apart, because it doesn't depend on how many builders there are. When everything is planned out, you'd have to go back to the drawing board if some of the robot builders bit the dust. But a decentralized system readily adapts to the loss of participants, Werfel said, just like what happens in nature with termites. ""If half the colony gets eaten by an aardvark, the rest can carry on,"" he said. There are still some engineering challenges that would need to be solved to ramp this up to large-scale projects on Earth, the study said, but Werfel said it's conceivable that designing robot systems such as these for disaster zones would in the realm of years away, Werfel said. For more extreme environments such as other planets, scaling these kinds of robots up to the task might take decades, Werfel said. But conceivably the principle of this study could be applied to send robots to build a base on Mars. If they build it, maybe we will come.","Small robots can behave like termites to build structures .

"Sochi, Russia (CNN) -- Who do you ask for help if you need to turn a muddy hole in the ground into a futuristic grand prix track? ""He's my sort of man,"" Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone says of Russian president Vladimir Putin's influence in the project to stage the nation's first grand prix this October in Sochi. ""He knows what he wants to do and he gets on and does it. I've never had any fear that what he agreed to do wouldn't happen. I think (Russia has) done a first-class job for F1 and a super job for the Olympics,"" Ecclestone told CNN. It's the kind of ringing endorsement that stands out like an oasis in a desert for a politician much derided for many of his policies by a large swathe of the international community. But then, the 83-year-old Ecclestone has a reputation for favoring those who he believes can deliver on their promises and thereby aid F1's further expansion. The growth of motorsport's elite division into one of the world's most valuable sport franchises has been built on such relationships and Ecclestone's shrewd 40-year management of them. The Sochi circuit is the culmination of talks that first started in the 1980s, when a plan to run a race through Red Square in Moscow was abandoned -- ""they didn't want to replace the cobblestones with paving,"" says Ecclestone -- and is a major statement of intent from Putin's government to secure the city's post-Games future. Talks became serious six years ago, when the Olympic project gained momentum. ""He's been following the plans all of the way through,"" Ecclestone says of Putin's involvement. New locations are always a risk for F1's management. The promise of lucrative hosting deals and iconic locations often turn to dust before coming to reality, as plans for a race in New Jersey recently demonstrated. But the Sochi pitch filled Ecclestone with confidence, so much so that a six-year deal reportedly worth in excess of $250 million -- though Ecclestone would not confirm that figure -- was signed to secure the event until 2020. ""I think Russia is an important nation full stop. F1 is a world championship, so it's difficult to think of leaving Russia out of a world event like this,"" Ecclestone said. ""We looked at what they were building ... and tailored ourselves around what they had constructed for the events already."" But the task of fitting an F1 circuit within the confines of an Olympic Park proved no easy task. ""Originally we had an idea to build the track through the main Fisht Stadium,"" Oleg Zabara, promoter of the Sochi Grand Prix, told CNN from his office in the paddock area of the newly-built pit lane compound. So organizers turned to track designer Hermann Tilke -- ""nothing is impossible for him,"" says Zabara -- with the German engineer offering another plan more suitable for the Olympic Park facilities. ""It was a big hole!"" says Tilke, recalling his initial impressions of when he visited the Sochi site in 2010. ""It looked like a desert of mud ... but I had a fantasy in my mind of how it would look later so I wasn't too worried."" The complexity of the new circuit design -- it needed to be cut through the middle of the Olympic Park and weaved in between the stadium and arenas -- provided Tilke with plenty of challenges. ""I've had more meetings about Sochi than any other track,"" the architect says. ""We were a construction site within a construction site ... (but) in many ways it's like a city track -- you cannot move a house in a city, you have to work with the situation. ""The stadiums, arenas and pipes and cables under the earth had to be factored in."" Turn four -- a long, sweeping circular corner which the cars will enter at 80 miles per hour and exit at 190 mph -- fills Tilke with particular pride, and he believes it will be ""the hardest in F1,"" especially when the surface is slippery or when attempted on degraded tires. Despite his pride at a job well done, Tilke admits he'll feel ""very nervous"" on the day of the race because the track until then remains a prototype. As with the Olympic constructions, it seems costs were not foremost in organizers' minds in their ambition to construct a world-class facility. ""We've spent about $330 million (so far). But I'm not worried about the cost only about the quality,"" Zabara says. ""I can say for sure that the cost of the track will be three to four times cheaper than the circuit in Abu-Dhabi."" The promoter is hoping a race on Russian soil will attract many of the country's F1 fans who already travel the world to watch the championship, as well as creating a new domestic supporter base willing to pay $200 a ticket to attend. ""About 60,000 fans are expected to come here and that will mean an extension of the resort season (in the town) too,"" says Zabara. ""It's also suitable to use the track throughout the season -- we've signed contracts with GP2, GP3, the Porsche Cup and hope to attract MotoGP,"" adds Zabara, a fan of motorcycling star Valentino Rossi. The plans for the Sochi GP certainly don't lack for ambition and chime well with the wider Putin-driven plan of trying to rebrand Russia through the city. It's maybe the reason Ecclestone expects the Russian president to attend the inaugural race in October and why he remains so enthusiastic about this month's Winter Games. ""People love to criticize anything new don't they? But we'll look back at Vancouver and say it didn't come close to what we've just seen in Sochi,"" Ecclestone argues. Maybe the same will soon be said of the Sochi Grand Prix.","F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone backs Russian president Vladimir Putin's way of working .

"A crying mother cradles and moves her dead baby to the floor, yelling out, ""My child, my child."" Outside, another woman shakes and gestures in a fit of absolute grief as she piercingly screams, ""Pray to God and his prophet sister."" Both women had brought their children to a clinic in a rebel-held part of northwestern Syria, hoping to help save their lives. Instead, at least 15 children -- all under the age of 2 -- died after receiving measles vaccinations through a U.N.-sponsored program. As many as 50 other children got sick after what a U.N. report described as a ""bungled immunization."" So how did it happen? Syria's foreign ministry blames ""this catastrophe (on) leaders of the armed terrorist organizations"" -- a term President Bashar al-Assad's government uses for rebel groups -- ""and their supporters ... the Turkish authorities,"" according to a report from the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). In a joint statement, the World Health Organization and UNICEF said Wednesday that the groups' vaccination program in Idlib and Deir Ezzor provinces has been halted as a team of experts try to get to the bottom of the situation. A spokesman for the WHO, the public health arm of the United Nations, said a preliminary investigation suggests the deaths can be attributed not to a criminal act but simple human error. The WHO spokesman, Christian Lindmeier, said early reports suggest medics may have accidentally mixed a high-dose muscle relaxant into the vaccine powder instead of the designated serum. ""Apparently, in the same fridge ... where the vaccines were stored, there was also a muscle relaxant,"" Lindmeier explained Thursday to CNN, adding the vaccine itself likely wasn't contaminated. ""The muscle relaxant vial looks like the same vial as the vaccine."" This explanation may not do much right now to blunt the agony and anger of those who saw children die this week in Syria's Idlib province. Some distressed parents and local authorities have demanded not only an investigation, but that the medical personnel involved be put on trial, according to Mohamad Alkanash, an anti-Assad activist in the town of Jarjanaz. The Syrian government sent letters to the United Nations describing the incident as ""an ugly crime"" and claiming the children were given ""rotten, spoiled and poisoned vaccines,"" SANA reported. Notably, the vaccinations were administered in areas that the Damascus-based central government doesn't control, and therefore may not have direct knowledge of. And therein lies a larger issue: Syria's years-long civil war has caused number of humanitarian crises, including related to the spread of infectious diseases -- including ones, like measles, that can be tackled through immunizations. There's widespread violence and very little functioning government in some areas, leaving people young and old at risk. In December 2012, the WHO and UNICEF announced they would work with Syria's health ministry to distribute at least 1.5 million doses of measles vaccine in government-controlled areas. Still, hundreds of thousands of others are in areas not controlled by al-Assad's government. Doctors Without Borders, also known as Medicins San Frontieres, noted in June 2013 that at least 7,000 people had been infected in a measles epidemic in northern Syria. This is why U.N. organizations stepped in, hoping to address a dire need through vaccinations. Yet no one imagined the scenes that unfolded this week in Jarjanaz. Ali Abouel Majd, another anti-Assad activist, described one child dying in front of him. ""The child slowly ran out of breath before my eyes,"" Majd recalled. ""Doctors rushed to save some (children) and placed oxygen masks on their faces."" While the vaccination program may be stopped for now, that doesn't mean it won't someday resume. Lindmeier, the WHO spokesman, said that there are ""strong guidelines"" in place to avoid a situation like this one, ""but we cannot avoid 100% of human error."" ""The major challenge,"" Lindmeier said, ""is to make sure this campaign can continue safely.""","U.N.: Children die, at least 50 sickened after ""bungled immunization"" in northern Syria .

"Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin faces prison with few of his former constituents shedding any tears for the man who led them through the biggest disaster in the city's modern history. The two-term mayor quit New Orleans after leaving office in 2010 and now lives in the Dallas suburbs. He swore off public life on his way out, and much of the city appeared ready to wash its hands of him after his Wednesday conviction on federal corruption charges. ""At one point or another, just about everybody voted for Nagin,"" said Clancy DuBos, political editor of the New Orleans alternative weekly Gambit. ""And we all got fooled."" Nagin has four months before his scheduled sentencing June 11 -- his 58th birthday. The most serious of the 20 counts on which he was convicted carry terms of up to 20 years, but most observers expect he'll receive somewhere between 12 and 20, DuBos said. 'Too many halo-shiners' Oliver Thomas, a former City Council president during Nagin's administration, said the ex-mayor now ""has an opportunity for reflection"" and to take responsibility for his actions. Thomas speaks from a certain degree of experience, having served three years in federal prison in a 2007 bribery case. ""Everybody in political office should probably go to prison, just so you can come back to the people and humility,"" said Thomas, who now hosts a radio show in New Orleans. ""I'm tired of seeing gloating political people and then you see they have weaknesses, also ... We got too many halo-shiners in the world."" Thomas criticized the ""bandwagon"" he said was now cheering Nagin's conviction, but added, ""We all have to take responsibility. And when you're a leader, especially an African-American leader, your integrity can't be 99%. We have to be better."" Federal prosecutors said Nagin was at the center of a kickback scheme that brought him more than $200,000 in bribes, plus personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city. Several of those businessmen had already pleaded guilty, and they testified against the ex-mayor during the two-week trial. Nagin maintained his innocence after Wednesday's verdict, which made him New Orleans' first mayor to be convicted of federal corruption charges. His defense was outgunned from the start, DuBos said. ""You're up against federal prosecutors whose client literally prints money,"" he said. ""It takes a spirited defense and a substantive defense on federal criminal charges. You've got to spend some money to counter that to create your own timeline, to create your own narrative."" But Nagin didn't provide that support for his own defense, DuBos said. So in court, ""It all came down to Nagin being on the stand, and the jurors said he came across as smug."" Nagin's lawyer, Robert Jenkins, did not return calls for comment Thursday. He told reporters after the verdict, ""We did the best we could do."" The onetime cable-television executive was elected in 2002 on a pledge of reform with the backing of city's powerful business community. Both Gambit and the New Orleans Times-Picayune endorsed Nagin in his first run, only to oppose him later. 'People are generally forgiving' Nagin drew national attention when Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, flooding more than three-fourths of New Orleans and killing more than 1,800 people across the region. Supporters credited his sometimes-profane pleas for aid from Washington for embarrassing the President George W. Bush administration into stepping up its response to the storm -- but his critics say he botched the city's recovery. ""His legacy is almost a non-legacy,"" DuBos said. ""There was nothing that he actually got done. Along with his conviction, his legacy will be one of poisoning the well for any, quote, business candidate for mayor for another 20 years."" Nagin won a second term in 2006 despite a controversy over his pledge that New Orleans would remain a ""chocolate"" city, even as much of the city's African-American population was displaced by storm damage. But his support in both black and white wards collapsed in his last four years, something Thomas attributed as much to style and substance. ""He was mostly aloof, kind of hands-off,"" Thomas said. Nagin ""was great at running a corporation. He was one of the smartest people I ever worked with."" But he lacked the personal touch a politician needs, Thomas said. He urged Nagin to use his prison time to help other inmates ""who need his time and talent."" ""That will be very rewarding, very fruitful, and he will have purpose,"" Thomas said. ""And when he comes home, there's always work to do on the streets, especially in urban areas."" ""This is the greatest country in the world, and people are generally forgiving,"" he added. ""People will embrace you if you're willing to do the work.""","Former New Orleans mayor faces prison; few sound sorry to see him go .

"An arrest warrant has been issued in the case of 18-year-old Hannah Graham, a University of Virginia student who disappeared more than a week ago. The warrant is for Jesse Matthew, who police believe was the last person to see her. He is wanted on suspicion of abduction with the intent to defile, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters Tuesday. One day earlier, a new search warrant was issued for Matthew's apartment. Authorities found specific clothing they were looking for, Longo said on CNN's ""New Day."" The clothing was sent to a lab for analysis. The Charlottesville Police Department is circulating a wanted poster for Matthew, 32, who is also wanted on two counts of reckless driving. Many questions remain unanswered, but here is what CNN knows and doesn't know so far: . What we know . Who is Graham? She's a second-year University of Virginia student making straight A's, her parents say. ""Hannah is beyond precious to us,"" John and Susan Graham said in a statement released shortly after she went missing. ""We are truly devastated by her disappearance. It's totally out of character for us not to have heard from her, and we fear foul play."" Holding a stuffed bunny named BB, his daughter's favorite plush toy and ""guardian angel,"" John Graham pleaded last weekend for someone to come forward with information on his daughter, who he said loved helping people. ""Last spring break, instead of hanging around on the beach, she spent a week in Tuscaloosa rebuilding houses,"" her father said. The Northern Virginia native is 5 feet 11 inches tall with a slender build and has light brown hair, blue eyes and freckles. She was last seen September 13 wearing a black crop top, according to a UVA news release. Where was she before her disappearance? On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away from the party. That was shortly before midnight, according to a timeline compiled by CNN affiliate WVIR. About 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside of a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex. A doorman turned her away at the pub, Longo said Sunday. Ten minutes later, she is seen running past a gas station -- no one appears to be pursuing her -- and witnesses say they saw her five minutes later roughly four blocks from the gas station, WVIR reported. She was at a restaurant in an area known as Downtown Mall, witnesses said. The surveillance camera at an Italian cafe captured her walking along the mall about 1:06 a.m. The camera at a jewelry store recorded her passing two minutes later, WVIR reported. At 1:20 a.m. she texted her friends to say she was lost and trying to find a party, WVIR reported. She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR reports. Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, Longo said, and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself. What are police doing to find her? ""I believe Jesse Matthew was the last person she was seen with before she vanished off the face of the Earth,"" the police chief said Sunday. ""We want to talk to him."" Anyone who saw Matthew's burnt-orange 1998 Chrysler coupe that night should call the police tip line at 434-295-3851, Longo said. Police had previously said they were looking for a man who did not fit Matthew's description, but rather was a black male in his 20s or 30s with a shaved head and goatee. Matthew has dreadlocks. ""I hope and pray that we might have an opportunity to talk to Jesse Matthew again because I think he can help up find Hannah Graham,"" the police chief said. In addition to Monday's search warrant, authorities previously searched Matthew's apartment and car but have declined to say what -- if anything -- was found. They have interviewed at least 50 people and received more than 100 tips in the case. Last weekend, more than 1,200 volunteers and Virginia Department of Emergency Management officials spent the weekend searching for clues that would lead them to Graham, CNN affiliate WTVR reported. As time passes, the search area grows, investigators say. Authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Graham's safe return. What we don't know . Where is Matthew? Matthew willingly went to a police station last weekend, along with several family members, walking through the front door and asking for a lawyer, the police chief said. There was no warrant for his arrest at that time. Matthew and the lawyer spoke and then left, Longo said, giving detectives no clearer picture of what may have happened the day Graham disappeared. Police executed a new search warrant at his home Monday, and Matthew's landlord told WVIR that police took two items. She also told WVIR that she hadn't seen Matthew since Thursday, and two of his roommates had moved out. The University of Virginia Medical Center confirmed to WVIR that Matthew has worked there since August 12. Matthew is known to have contacts in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, according to police. Are there links to other cases? The short answer is no. However, the Route 29 corridor where Graham disappeared has a peculiar history. According to WTVR, Graham is the fourth woman to disappear from the area since 2009. Morgan Harrington of Charlottesville, Alexis Murphy of Lovingston and Samantha Clarke of Orange also went missing there. All the women were between 17 and 20 years old, WVIR reported. In July, Randy Taylor, 43, was sentenced to two life terms for Murphy's 2013 abduction and murder, although her body was never found, WVIR reported. Clarke's mother is still looking for answers more than four years after her 19-year-old's disappearance. Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her remains were found on a farm months later. Police have yet to track down her killer, and her family has long said they suspect there could be other victims. The T-shirt Harrington was wearing when she disappeared was found near where Graham disappeared. ""Certainly the question has arisen. It's certainly a legitimate question,"" Longo told reporters this month. Harrington's mother told WTVR that Route 29 has an ""infamous reputation."" ""I don't know. Either there is a commonality or a crime spree,"" she told WTVR. ""We have long passed a critical mass that needs looking at. If you look at the map of missing and abducted along Route 29 -- it's not a normal pattern.""","An arrest warrant is issued for 32-year-old Jesse Matthew .

"It could be the wedding video to end all wedding videos. There are not many newlyweds who can say they received a call from the President of the United States on their wedding day. Granted, the President was calling to apologize after the bride and groom -- Natalie Heimel and Ed Mallue Jr. -- were forced to scramble to find an alternate location for their wedding, once they were informed by the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii that Obama wanted to play through the site of their nuptials. ""Listen. Congratulations on your wedding. I feel terrible. Nobody told us,"" Obama told the couple in a video provided to CNN by the bride's family. ""If they had just mentioned that they were going to have a wedding on the 16th hole, we would have skipped the 16th hole,"" the President added. ""I hope the wedding went OK anyway,"" he continued. In the video, Heimel and Mallue can be seen all dressed up for their big day, hanging on Obama's every word, and laughing as they carried on a conversation with the President that lasted several minutes. The wedding was just fine, Mallue and Heimel reassured Obama, who was clearly embarrassed by the mix-up. ""Thank you very much. It was a blessing in disguise,"" Mallue said. ""We just went right above the 16th hole. So we were watching you golf,"" Heimel joked about their new wedding site. Acknowledging he is far from an ace golfer, Obama quipped, ""That must have been kind of painful."" ""What did you shoot, Mr. President?"" Mallue asked. ""I shot an 84. If I had skipped the 16th hole, I would have shot a 79,"" Obama replied. The conversation then turned to what sounded like an episode of the presidential dating game. ""How long you been going out?"" Obama asked. The couple proceeded to tell Obama they have been dating since 2011. The military couple, both captains, attended West Point, before moving to Germany where they met. They now live in Hawaii, which led to the President's next question. ""Now, the only question is where do you honeymoon when you live in Hawaii?"" Obama joked. ""We haven't figured that part out yet,"" Heimel joked. ""Might be Fort Polk, Louisiana,"" Mallue quipped. The couple then invited Obama to their reception. Fearing he might cause another wedding mishap, the President respectfully declined. ""Everybody would have to be magged,"" Obama joked about his security needs. ""Sorry for the change of plans. But sounds like you guys are gonna have a great wedding and at least you will have a good story to tell."" ""Congratulations and thank you both for your service,"" Obama added at the end of the call.","President Obama called newlyweds after his golf game interrupted their wedding plans .

"(CNN)Martin Greenfield is one of the world's most respected and accomplished tailors. Since emigrating from the former Czechoslovakia to America in 1947, he has dressed everyone from the Rat Pack and Leonardo DiCaprio to Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama. But Greenfield's success follows tremendous adversity. As a teenager, he survived two horrific years in concentration camps during the Holocaust, and lost his parents and siblings at the hands of the Nazis. In this excerpt from his memoir Measure of a Man, Greenfield describes how an encounter with an SS guard at Auschwitz led him to pick up a needle and thread for the first time, and how tragedy taught him the power of clothes. Martin Greenfield: It was our second day inside Auschwitz. The soldiers asked if we knew any trades, like masonry, carpentry, medicine—that kind of thing. Dad grabbed my wrist and thrust it into the air. ""He is a mechanic. Very skilled,"" he said. Above the gates at Auschwitz was a sign. It read Arbeit macht frei (""Work makes you free""). By volunteering my skills as a mechanic, my father protected me. It was his way of marking me for the Germans as a Jew whose skills they could exploit, as one not to be burned. As soon as my father offered up my skills, two Germans walked toward us to take me away. I then did something I should not have done, something stupid: I ran. Why, I do not know. Fences and soldiers were everywhere. Where did I think I was going? I cannot say. But for whatever reason, I ran. A few paces into my sprint, I heard a barking German shepherd barreling down on me. My arms pumped hard as I stretched my stride and ran faster than I'd ever run before. The barks got louder. I snapped my head back over my shoulder and saw the dog closing in. He leapt and latched his teeth onto my leg. I looked down. The dog hung from my calf. I shoved his head with both hands. He snarled and gnashed violently as I struggled to pry him loose. The dog's jaw unlocked, taking a meaty chunk with him. Blood spurted on my prisoner uniform, the dog's mouth—everywhere. I tried not to cry. Not in front of my father, not in front of the other men and boys. The two soldiers tromped over to retrieve the dog and make sure he was uninjured. They then snatched me up off the ground and hauled me away from the group. I thought maybe that night I would join my father again, but that did not happen. That day, my second inside Auschwitz, was the last time I ever saw my father. The Germans dragged me to the laundry. Whether they wanted me first to perform a simpler task than mechanical work, or whether this was a punishment for trying to flee, I do not know. But after my sprinting stunt, I was eager to show the Germans I was a hard worker who could be of use. My first job in the camps was washing Nazi uniforms. I knew nothing of the task. Still, I grabbed a brush and an SS soldier's shirt and scrubbed hard and fast. After working my way about halfway through the pile, it happened. I scrubbed so hard the bristles ripped the collar. The face of the pacing soldier at my station flushed red. I do not remember his words, but I remember his baton. He beat me until I bled. He needed to make an example out of me for the other prisoners. When he was finished with my flogging, he balled up the torn shirt and threw it in my face before huffing off. The shirt was trash to the soldier but not to me. I kept it. Working in the laundry was a nice man who knew how to sew. He gave me a needle and thread and taught me how to sew a simple stitch. I mended the shirt. To this day I still don't know why, but when I got up the courage, I slipped the soldier's shirt on and wore it under my striped prisoner uniform. It was a crazy thing to do, because none of the other prisoners had a shirt. But I did it anyhow. From that day on, the soldiers treated me a little bit better. They thought I was somebody—someone who mattered, someone not to be killed. The prisoners treated me a little bit better as well. You must remember that some of the kapos (supervisors) were Jewish prisoners, but they could be brutal. They wanted to please the Germans, so some of them would be hard on us so the Germans would not punish them. Sometimes the kapos were harsher than some of the Germans. When I had my soldier shirt on, however, that did not happen. When I wore the shirt, the kapos didn't mess with me. The shirt means something, I thought. And so I wore the shirt. In fact, I ripped another one on purpose so I could have two. The day I first wore that shirt was the day I learned clothes possess power. Clothes don't just ""make the man,"" they can save the man. They did for me. Of course, receiving your first tailoring lesson inside a Nazi concentration camp was hardly the ideal apprenticeship. I would have much preferred to hone my craft on Savile Row or in the mills of Milan. Looking back, though, that moment in the camps marked the beginning of the rest of my life. Strangely enough, two ripped Nazi shirts helped this Jew build America's most famous and successful custom-suit company. God has a wonderful sense of humor.

"(CNN) -- What may be the worst flooding since 1927 turned communities across Vermont on Sunday into islands, as high, fast-moving waters swamped roads and shredded some of the state's iconic covered bridges. In some areas, homes knocked off their foundations by Hurricane Irene's wrath floated in lake and rivers. One woman was swept away in the Deerfield River in Wilmington and was feared dead, Gov. Peter Shumlin told CNN. The flooding is so pervasive that officials had no clear idea Sunday night of the potential number of casualties, not to mention the full extent and cost of the damage. ""I think tomorrow we may find some bad things,"" said state police Capt. Ray Keefe. ""I hope not."" The state was under a flash-flood watch Sunday night. Residents were told to expect 4 to 7 inches of rain through Monday morning. Hundreds of roads remained closed. CNN iReporters provided astounding video images of flooding, especially in the southern part of the state. Military high-water vehicles were sent to Wilmington, which was cut off from outside access. Keefe, who said the flooding was the worst he has seen in his 24 years with the department, described scenes of utter devastation. ""The storm essentially shut southern Vermont down,"" he said. ""It's terrible."" While the state ordered no evacuations in advance, Shumlin said it was prepared for the storm and knew it was going to receive torrential rainfall. Because so many towns are in lowlands and because there are few large areas of dry land, large-scale evacuation was impractical, he said. In the ski resort town of Ludlow, near Okemo in south-central Vermont, town communications officer Dave Vanguilder said about three dozen roads in the area were closed. Three or four bridges were washed out. Montpelier, the capital in the north, reported worsening conditions Sunday evening. Portions of the city of 8,000 were evacuated and people were told to stay off the roads. Jill Remick, from the state's emergency management division, said waters in the area -- where multiple rivers converge -- could rise as high as 20 feet, above the 17.5 feet that led to substantial flooding in May. City Manager William J. Fraser told CNN Sunday evening that most of downtown, which has retail, insurance offices and boutiques, likely will be underwater by Monday. Many buildings already had water in them. Fraser was concerned about contamination from flooded structures getting into the Winooski and North Branch rivers. Montpelier, like most of the state, has saturated ground from snow and spring rains. A 1992 flood, caused by an ice jam, sent 4 to 5 feet of water downtown. ""We don't know what 20 feet looks like,"" Fraser said. The state government complex likely will be safe, but at least one low-lying residential area is threatened and has been evacuated, he said. Residents were urged to leave flood-prone areas on Saturday. With about 625,000 people, Vermont is often defined by its covered bridges, quaint communities and rolling hills, mountains and valleys. Its summers are typically serene, especially compared to sometimes snow-filled winters, yet the recent flooding attesting to the fact that Mother Nature -- for all its beauty -- also carries significant perils year-round in the Green Mountain State. Many towns and cities are in valleys, next to rivers or downhill from flood runoff. In Brattleboro, near the New Hampshire border, officials in the city of 12,000 were concerned about the structural integrity of bridges and roadways. Precautionary evacuations began Saturday night. ""We've seen nothing like this,"" said Town Manager Barbara Sondag. ""We've had no loss of life and are very thankful."" The nearby Connecticut River was expected to crest Monday. And the town is as worried about the normally idyllic Whetstone Brook, a waterway that flows in from the west. CNN iReporter David Cadran videotaped the brook's raging waters rushing through town. Cadran, 23, said he and a friend were downtown when they spotted water starting to come down the road. ""Then police came through and said, 'You guys have to get out of here, there's a wall of water coming,' "" he told CNN. Soon thereafter, he noticed a home's ""whole deck floating down the river,"" as well as numerous propane tanks. Much of the downtown area was soon immersed in four feet of water, according to Cadran. ""It was shredding everything that went through,"" he said of an area that children often go swimming in . Like Montpelier, Battleboro believes its water system will be in good shape. Sondag said the city is monitoring its sewer plant. Mark Bosma, a spokesman for the state's emergency management division, described conditions as ""awful"" in many parts of the state with ""some small towns ... entirely covered with water."" ""There has been steady, heavy rains all day,"" he said. ""We got reports of people stranded at schools and in cars. One woman was swept away in a river. Water is pretty much everywhere."" Another iReporter, William Battilana, said that Woodstock -- about 70 miles north of Brattleboro -- also had major flooding of the Ottauquechee River, with propane tanks from a storage yard scattered along the banks. Vermont emergency management officials got a phone call that one woman was in labor and driving to the hospital before she was waylaid by flood waters, Bosma said. ""She couldn't get there, so she went to a school,"" he said. ""She's doing fine now, things are stabilized, (and) we are making arrangements to get her out."" There were no mandatory evacuations ahead of the storm. Cadran said many dismissed the prospect that a hurricane -- that hits land about 120 miles away -- could do serious damage in Vermont. ""We get hurricanes here, and everybody kind of jokes about it saying, 'Please, we're so far inland,' "" he said. ""It's unlike anything that anyone in town has ever seen. People are totally in shock."" Town officials expect residents to band together and help with the clean-up. ""The attitude is fantastic,"" said Montpelier's Fraser. ""People will work together."" CNN's Divina Mims contributed to this report.","NEW: Ravaged state is under flash-flood watch .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton hasn't said whether she's going to run for president in 2016. And Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has said, repeatedly, that she's not planning to run. But, given the dynamics of today's politics, the two women need each other. And they both should run for the Democratic nomination. A primary challenge from Warren could be the very best thing to happen to Clinton in a run for the presidency. Most pundits have argued that a Warren challenge would be a problem that Clinton needs to confront, a genuine roadblock in her path to the presidency. The division and discord, they say, would be a repeat of the 2008 primaries where she ultimately lost to Barack Obama. But a Warren candidacy could have a very healthy effect for Clinton and for the Democratic Party. The biggest challenge that Clinton faces right now, assuming that she decides to run, is that she might be unable to generate enough excitement among Democrats that would mobilize voters and excite the media in the general election. Part of the problem revolves around the same old issue of ""inevitability."" As in 2008, people treat her candidacy as a given and assume that she would be the likely Democratic nominee. In American politics, voters tend to like the underdog. When Clinton hit the campaign trail in 2008 as the ""inevitable"" winner, she often fell flat. Obama used the image of inevitability against her. Indeed, some of the finest moments in her campaign came toward the end when it became clear that Obama was probably going to win the nomination. Her fight intensified, and she made a much stronger appeal to key elements of the Democratic Party. As New York Sen. Chuck Schumer recently reminded his party, Democrats do best when they deal with the issues facing the middle class and advance an agenda that focuses on economic security for all. Far from being ""radical,"" this has been the kind of policy agenda for which Democratic voters thirst. It was the heart of the New Deal and the Great Society, as well as successful Democratic midterm campaigns (like 1982 or 2006) and the 2008 election. In recent times, Democrats have done well when they pay attention to the middle class and suffer when they move too far away from these issues. This kind of agenda could inspire Democratic voters and attract independents who are frustrated with the continued challenges facing the middle class. If Warren forces Clinton to confront these issues and to articulate a stronger response to the economic issues of our days -- creating countervailing pressure to the political experts who will implore her to stay away from these questions -- it would only make the former first lady and secretary of state a stronger candidate. Warren's candidacy would force Clinton to put herself on the record over how she would help the middle class -- committing to the kinds of policies that will be desirable to many voters, including some independents and even moderate Republicans who are struggling in this economy and who are uncomfortable with the solutions offered by a GOP that continues to lean hard to the right. A Warren candidacy would also put pressure on Clinton's team to make sure they pay close attention to the grass roots. In the 2008 primaries, the Clinton campaign faltered in dealing with the political ground war, the job of mobilizing and organizing local activists and deploying social media to bring out supporters. If there is no Democratic challenger, Clinton might not do enough to prepare for the onslaught she would face from a GOP, a party armed with tea party activists and a huge network of campaign donors ready for battle. If Warren runs, Clinton will be forced to have her campaign infrastructure in place and in top form before the general election campaign begins. There is also the virtue of Clinton sharpening her basic campaign skills. Although she has never really left politics since her husband's election as President in 1992, she is probably a bit rusty, as her book rollout in June showed. In the current media environment, there is no room for mistakes -- and given that the Republicans might have some pretty strong candidates in the mix, she will have to be at the top of her game. Clinton is an immensely skilled politician and can compete with the best, but the challenge of running against Warren would make her stronger by the fall of 2016. Both candidates would benefit from a real primary. Polls show Clinton has a commanding lead against any challenger, including Warren, so the odds are this would not be a genuine threat to her nomination. But a primary would vastly enhance Warren's stature on Capitol Hill and give her a bigger profile within the party for years to come. For Clinton, a vigorous challenge from the base of the party will be just the kind of competitive spur that she needs.","Hillary Clinton hasn't said whether she's running in 2016; Elizabeth Warren says she is not .

"A suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest blew himself up among mourners inside a funeral tent on a farm about 12 miles north of Baghdad, Iraq, on Monday, according to police. At least 21 people were killed and 35 others injured at the funeral in al Taji, a mostly Sunni district, officials said. The funeral was for a member of the local Awakening Council, a group also known as the Sons of Iraq and Sahawat, made up of Sunni Arab fighters who turned against al Qaeda. Iraqi security forces believe that ISIS militants were behind the attack. Awakening Councils are U.S.-backed groups that have been active in Iraq since 2006.  A few years ago, the councils were credited as being a major factor in a drop in violence across Iraq, but council members have also become targets for jihadists.","A suicide bomber blows himself up at a funeral north of Baghdad .

"It was a sarcastic Facebook comment during an argument about a video game. And, according to the father of 19-year-old Justin Carter, it was enough to land his son behind bars for months, facing the possibility of years in prison. Carter, who is currently on suicide watch in Comal County Jail near San Antonio, Texas, has been locked up since February. He faces a charge of making terroristic threats, a felony that could theoretically bring a sentence of up to eight years. ""He's very depressed. He's very scared and he's very concerned that he's not going to get out,"" Jack Carter, Justin's father, told CNN on Tuesday. ""He's pretty much lost all hope."" In February, Justin, then 18, and a friend were arguing on Facebook with someone else over the online video game ""League of Legends."" ""Someone had said something to the effect of 'Oh you're insane. You're crazy. You're messed up in the head,'"" Jack Carter told CNN affiliate KVUE in Austin. ""To which he replied 'Oh yeah, I'm real messed up in the head. I'm going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still-beating hearts.'"" According to court documents, Justin wrote ""I'm f---ed in the head alright. I think I'ma (sic) shoot up a kindergarten and watch the blood of the innocent rain down and eat the beating heart of one of them."" Jack Carter said his son followed the claim with ""LOL"" and ""J/K"" -- indicating that the comment wasn't serious. But someone else -- Carter says a woman in Canada -- noticed the comment and reported it to authorities. Coming two months after the deadly shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, the report wasn't taken lightly. According to court documents, Carter lived less than a half-mile from an elementary school in New Braunfels, Texas. A search warrant was issued on February 13 and, a week later, a judge issued a warrant for his arrest. ""I thought it was a joke,"" Jack Carter told CNN. ""I couldn't believe the person that called me. I kept telling them they have to be kidding. When I realized he wasn't, I literally broke down crying."" A judge set bond for Justin Carter at $500,000, meaning that 10% of that, or $50,000, would have to be posted to get him out of jail while he awaits trial. His lawyer, Donald H. Flanary III, says that's far more than his family can afford. ""It's outrageous,"" Flanary, who is working the case for free, told CNN Tuesday. ""I've represented murderers and their bond was $150,000."" Flanary said he planned to meet with Justin Carter Tuesday afternoon and ask a judge for the bond to be reduced. He said police didn't find any weapons or other items to suggest that Justin's comment was serious, but that, ""in the times we're living in, it was kind of a perfect storm."" ""The law enforcement, the sheriff's department, the district attorney's office -- nobody wants to be the one that let him go,"" Flanary said. ""They don't think about the person or the crime or the lack of crime ... they don't want to take responsibility for something happening in the future."" A spokeswoman for the police department in Austin, where Justin was originally jailed, referred a request for comment and arrest documents to neighboring New Braunfels Police. A police department spokesman there did not immediately respond to a similar request. Meanwhile, people have come together online to support the jailed teen. A Change.org petition titled ""Release Justin Carter and Change the Investigative Criteria for Terroristic Threat Laws"" had received nearly 35,000 digital signatures as of Tuesday afternoon.

"A Sudanese Christian woman once sentenced to death in her native country because of her faith arrived in her new home, the United States, on Thursday. Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, her husband and two young children were greeted by a large crowd of supporters at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in New Hampshire. Ibrahim, whose sentence was overturned a few weeks ago, didn't speak with the media. Her brother-in-law, Gabriel Wani, said there was ""a lot of happiness right now."" New Hampshire's senators, Kelly Ayotte and Jeanne Shaheen, sent staff members to the terminal and sent out a news release welcoming Ibrahim to the state. ""She has inspired the world with her extraordinary courage and resilience, and I join all Granite Staters in extending a warm welcome to Meriam and her family,"" Ayotte said. The senators were in Washington, casting votes. Court sentence for apostasy, marrying a Christian . Ibrahim's ordeal started when a Muslim relative filed a criminal complaint saying she had married Daniel Wani, a Christian, after going missing for several years. A Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim. She was charged with adultery on grounds that a Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan. Ibrahim also was charged with apostasy, accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith. She was convicted in May, while about eight months pregnant.  In chains, Ibrahim gave birth about two weeks later in a women's hospital in Khartoum. Ibrahim had been detained since mid-January. She refused to let go of her 20-month-old son, Martin, for fear she would never see him again. Ibrahim was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother. Her father left when she was 6 years old. She was raised by her mother as a Christian. A court in Sudan overturned Ibrahim's death sentence a few weeks ago, but police arrested her again June 24 when she and her family tried to leave Sudan to go to the United States. Wani is an American citizen who has lived in Manchester since 1998. New charges . Police accused her of falsifying travel documents in an attempt to fly to the United States with her family. They were taken into custody at the airport in the capital, Khartoum. The family had been confined to a safe house in Sudan until last week, when they traveled to Italy. Italy maintains good relations with Khartoum and offered to help the U.S. Embassy there speed up the process of getting U.S. passports for Ibrahim and her family, Italy's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lapo Pistelli said. Manchester -- with a population of about 110,000, the largest city in northern New England -- has long served as a resettlement site for refugees from dozens of countries who have been scattered throughout the United States by the State Department. Since the late 1990s, more than 500 people from what is now South Sudan were resettled in New Hampshire, the majority of them in Manchester, according to refugee advocates.","Mariam Yehya Ibrahim was released from death row in Sudan .

"The U.S. Air Force is breaking out some of its heaviest hardware to send a message to North Korea. A Pentagon spokesman said Monday that B-52 bombers are making flights over South Korea as part of military exercises this month. ""Despite challenges with fiscal constraints, training opportunities remain important to ensure U.S. and ROK (Republic of Korea) forces are battle-ready and trained to employ air power to deter aggression, defend the Republic of Korea and defeat any attack against the alliance,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said Monday in a meeting with reporters at the Pentagon. Little said the eight-engine bombers first flew as part of the annual Foal Eagle training exercises on March 8 and were to fly again over South Korea on Tuesday. ""This mission highlights the extended deterrence and conventional capabilities of the B-52 Stratofortress,"" Little said Monday. The bombers are flying out of Andersen Air Force Base on the Pacific island of Guam as part of what the U.S. Pacific Command calls a ""continuous bomber presence"" in the region. The round trip between Guam and the Korean Peninsula is about 4,000 miles. ""These ... missions are routine and reiterate the U.S. commitment to the security of our allies and partners,"" Little said. The B-52 flights come amid spiking tensions between North Korea and the United States after the U.N. Security Council voted to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea following its latest nuclear test last month. In a slew of angry rhetoric in response to the U.N. vote, North Korea has threatened to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the United States and South Korea and said it was nullifying the armistice agreement that stopped the Korean War in 1953. Reacting to the U.S. flights, a spokesman for the North Korean foreign ministry described them as an ""unpardonable provocation,"" the state news agency reported. ""The DPRK is now closely watching the move of B-52 and the hostile forces will never escape its strong military counteraction, should the strategic bomber make such sortie to the peninsula again,"" KCNA reported. Seoul said the B-52 flights demonstrate the strength of the U.S.-South Korea alliance. ""As North Korea threatened to attack South Korea with nuclear weapons, the exercise involving B-52s is meaningful as it shows U.S. commitment to provide its nuclear umbrella on the Korean Peninsula,"" South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said in a briefing, according to a report from the Yonhap news agency. U.S. officials said they don't believe North Korea is in a position to strike the United States at the moment, but Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced plans last week to deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast as part of efforts to enhance the nation's ability to defend itself from attack. As for the B-52s, they have been in the U.S. arsenal since 1955. Once part of the country's nuclear triad planes, missiles and submarines, the B-52 is now used predominantly as a conventional bomber and as a platform for air-launched cruise missiles. The Air Force said B-52s dropped 40% of all the munitions used by coalition forces during Operation Desert Storm in the early 1990s.","North Korea describes the move as as ""unpardonable provocation""

"Stereotypes of Danish cuisine inevitably feature visions of streaky bacon and swirly pastries. But trail-blazing restaurants like the two Michelin-starred ""Noma"" have ushered in a fashion for so-called ""New Nordic Cuisine"" that has seen bon vivants straining their vocal chords in songs of praise. Copenhagen, the stylish Danish capital, is leading the way in this North European culinary revolution. Indeed, the latest edition of the Michelin Guide awarded the city's restaurants an impressive 14 stars -- more than any other of its Scandinavian counterparts. But the city is also dotted with eateries for all occasions and tastes, offering more than just Michelin starred fine dining. Here is CNN's at-a-glance guide to Europe's new culinary capital. NomaFor a foraged feast . Noma is hidden inside an 18th-century storage building that was once used to keep salt. Facing out onto the quiet waterways of Copenhagen Harbor, it's an unassuming location for a two Michelin star restaurant, regularly touted by industry experts as the best in the world today. René Redzepi, founder and head chef, has been wowing foodies ever since Noma's relatively recent emergence, with his extraordinary emphasis on local and foraged food, showcasing the cuisine of the cold North Atlantic. ""Vegetables in soil"" offers perhaps the most illustrative and notorious example of Redzepi's agrarian-focused philosophy. Locally sourced baby carrots, radishes, leeks and celeriac are served on a bed of ""soil"", which is in fact a combination of malt flour, hazelnut flour, melted butter and beer. Noma's interior echoes this earthy outlook. Rustic wooden beams extend between the white-washed walls, and food is served on bare dark oak tables. Those with time on their hands should opt for the 12-course ""Noma Nassaaq"" taster menu. The four-hour degustation begins with a platter of sea-buckthorn with pickled rose-hip petal, and culminates in a Jerusalem artichoke sorbet with apple, shortbread and chocolate discs, taking in a cosmic array of Nordic delights in between. See also: Indian master chef gets fresh at 'world's best restaurant' Royal CaféFor quirks and curios . Part design museum, part porcelain china shop, part upscale eatery, the Royal Café is less fine dining, more Mad Hatter's tea party. The interior is a sugary feast for the eyes. Ornate chandeliers hang from ceilings plastered with psychedelic wallpaper, and the long, slender room is adorned with curiosities that range from the sublime to the ridiculous, in a brand of décor the café calls ""funky baroque."" Created in collaboration with design legends like furniture company Fritz Hansen, architectural firm Arne Jacobsen and sound specialists Bang & Olufsen, the café is a testament quintessentially Danish design. Aside from a delightful selection of salads, pastries and hot chocolates, the Royal Café is best known for its modern take on traditional smørrebrød -- the famous Danish open sandwich typically adorned with meat or cheese. Here though, proprietor Rud Christiansen has added an east Asian dimension: sushi. The result is the endearingly termed ""Smushie"" -- colourful bite-sized sandwiches piled high with a selection of fish and vegetables. Den Økologiske PølsemandFor cheap eats . Readers of Danish newspaper Politken were recently asked to select their favourite Copenhagen eating establishment. The locals voted overwhelmingly in favor of the ""Den Økologiske Pølsemand"" (DOP) -- a humble hot dog stand. While the city is riddled with white vans peddling fairly predictable low-grade sausage and bun combos, DOP's owner Claus Christensen has set his heart on introducing a better breed of fast food. Everything is organic, from the star attraction of grilled pork sausage to the remoulade and fried onions. The buns are made from slow-fermented sourdough bread and linseed -- the sort of thoughtful detail that explains why DOP has so quickly become the people's champ. FiskebarenFor sea food fanciers . In this fish-focused eatery, the main courses salute the unsung heroes of the North Sea, with often neglected specimens such as dab and whiting on the menu. Ordinarily hum-drum dishes are given a ""New Nordic Cuisine""-style twist. The fish and chips, for example, are made from fresh and zealously sourced haddock that is lightly smoked before frying, then cheekily served in the traditional newspaper cone. The décor features the mesmerizing centrepiece of a cylindrical jellyfish tank and decorative meat hooks hang from the ceiling. The latter are a homage to Fiskebaren's location in the former Meatpacking district (Vesterbro). As is so often the case with formerly dilapidated industrial quarters, the area has become excruciatingly cool, so book in advance or face a long wait. Mielcke & Hurtigkarl For garden enthusiasts . Situated in the Fredriksberg gardens, on grounds run by the Royal Danish Garden Society, Mielcke & Hurtigkarl infuses fine dining with prime horticulture to create a truly multi-sensory experience. Green textiles bring the encircling garden inside, as does a gently immersive soundscape that mimics the noise of forest creatures. All the while, shards of light dance on crystals hanging from the ceiling. The inventive kitchen pairs rare ingredients from around the world. Foie gras positioned on top of a ""bark"" made of bull kelp from Vancouver Island and a dessert of deconstructed berries, lavender ice cream, ""spherified""  (gelled) ruccula and apricot, and fresh clovers is a dish indicative of Mielcke & Hurtigkarl's blend of humor and haute cuisine.","Copenhagen is at the heart of the wave of ""New Nordic Cuisine""

"Although NASCAR driver Tony Stewart is not currently facing criminal charges in the death of another driver, he is not officially in the clear. ""This is an ongoing investigation, and all options remain available,"" Sheriff Philip C. Povero of Ontario County, New York, said Monday.  ""We're continuing to gather and analyze every piece of evidence we can."" Stewart hit and killed another driver who was walking on a track during a dirt-track race in upstate New York on Saturday night, authorities said. Kevin Ward Jr., 20, died from injuries suffered in the incident at the Empire Super Sprints series event at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park. The track is about a two-hour drive from Watkins Glen International race track, where Stewart had been scheduled to race in a NASCAR event Sunday. ""There aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr.,"" Stewart said Sunday, according to a written statement tweeted by NASCAR. ""It's a very emotional time for all involved. ... My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy."" Stewart decided not to take part in Sunday's event. ""Our hearts go out to Kevin's family,"" said Stewart's team director, Greg Zipadelli. ""This is a very tough, very emotional time for everybody -- his family, our family at Stewart-Haas Racing."" Opinion: Why Tony Stewart isn't likely to face charges in racetrack death . On Saturday night, Ward's sprint car hit the outside wall during lap 14 of a 25-lap race, Povero said. A video of the incident shows two cars coming out of a turn with Stewart's No. 14 car sliding up the track toward Ward's No. 13 car. The two cars get close and appear to make contact before Ward's car hits the wall and spins out. Another car narrowly avoids hitting the 13 car as its sits on the track facing the wrong direction. Ward gets out of his crashed car, walking on the track toward the racecars, which had slowed for a yellow flag. Ward points a finger and appears to be yelling. One car swerves to avoid Ward on the half-mile dirt track. Stewart's car passes close to Ward, and it appears that its right rear tire hits him. An ambulance took Ward to a hospital, but he died before it arrived, Povero said. ""Stewart has fully cooperated"" with an investigation, Povero said. ""He acknowledges the collision with the driver.""  It appeared to be an on-track incident, Povero said. Ward, from Port Leyden, New York, was in his fifth season in the Empire Super Sprints series. He began racing when he was 4, running go-kart events. Stewart's spokesman said officials are trying to sort out the details. ""A tragic accident took place last night during a sprint car race in which Tony Stewart was participating,"" Mike Arning said. ""Tony was unhurt, but a fellow competitor lost his life. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends."" A competitor that runs the car that swerved around Ward expressed sympathy. ""Our deepest condolences go to the entire Ward Family. We are one huge ESS family, you will be truly missed bud! #RIP13,"" Hebing Racing tweeted. Stewart is a three-time champion in NASCAR's top division and won a sprint car championship in 1995. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family, friends, and fellow competitors of Kevin Ward Jr.,"" NASCAR said in a written statement Sunday. ""We support Tony Stewart's decision to miss today's race, and we will continue to respect the process and timeline of the local authorities and will continue to monitor this situation moving forward."" Stewart also owns a dirt race track in New Weston, Ohio, and has frequently raced sprint cars during the NASCAR season. He broke a leg last year in a crash that ended his racing season. He has raced the full NASCAR season this year but only returned to sprint cars in July. In 2013: Injuries as debris flies into Daytona stands during fiery NASCAR crash .

"Australian authorities on Tuesday told more than 2,000 residents who had left a town at the mercy of record-breaking flood waters to stay away until the danger had passed. The swollen Balonne River, which cuts through the heart of the town of St. George in the eastern state of Queensland, reached 13.85 meters (45.4 feet) Tuesday morning and was expected to peak around 14 meters later in the day, said Steve Gollschewski, assistant commissioner of the Queensland Police. Even at their forecast peak level, the flood waters should not threaten the levee bank protecting the town, which stands at 14.5 meters, Gollschewski said. Nonetheless, the authorities said the risks remained too high to allow people back to their properties. ""The clear message for all of the residents of St. George is there will be no return today,"" said Ian Stewart, deputy commissioner of the  Queensland Police. ""Your safety is primary to our decision making."" Queensland has been deluged with heavy rains over the past week even as some parts of the region are still struggling to recover from devastating floods that took place about a year ago. The flooding this year has also affected parts of the neighboring state of New South Wales. According to the police, 222 residents remain in St. George -- out of a total population of about 3,000 -- along with 93 police officers and other emergency staff. The authorities had urged all residents to leave the town. Dozens of homes in southeastern Queensland have been inundated by the floods and hundreds of people have taken shelter in evacuation centers. Many others have been taken to the state capital, Brisbane. The army has provided military helicopters and a C-130 cargo plane to assist with search, evacuation and supply efforts. The cleanup from the flooding in Roma, Mitchell and Charleville -- three towns near St. George -- was in danger of being hampered by more bad weather Tuesday. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the area.","Flood waters in St. George are expected to peak around 45 feet .

"(CNN) -- A small tribe of Indians in Paraguay who have had virtually no contact with the outside world won a legal battle this week when rights groups stopped a Brazilian company from continuing to bulldoze the forest to clear land for cattle ranches. About 2,000 members of the Ayoreo ethnic group live in 13 settlements in Bolivia and Paraguay. The Totobiegosode tribe, said to number no more than 300, is the last group of uncontacted Indians in South America outside the Amazon River basin, indigenous rights groups say. The Totobiegosode, who are part of the larger Ayoreo ethnic group, are nomadic Indians who hunt and fish, as well as gather fruit and honey and cultivate small temporary plots during the rainy season. They live communally, four to six families to a dwelling, in the dense forests of northwestern Paraguay. Two Brazilian companies have been rapidly clearing land the Totobiegosode live on, and the tribe has lost nearly 15,000 acres (about 6,000 hectares) this year, according to British-based Survival International, an advocacy organization for the rights of tribal people. A ruling Thursday by Paraguay's secretary of the environment canceled a special permit for one of the companies, Yaguarete Pora S.A., to clear the land. The legal battle is being waged by local groups such as GAT, an acronym in Spanish for People, Environment and Territory. The activist groups have undertaken the fight without the knowledge of the Totobiegosode. Indian rights proponents see Thursday's ruling as an important victory. ""This sends a very significant signal,"" said Jonathan Mazower, campaign coordinator for Survival International. ""Until now, the ranchers and the landowners have really had it all their own way. They are very politically powerful and well-funded. ... This may be a sign that the government is starting to get a grip on the situation."" As their territory has been gobbled up, some Totobiegosode have been spotted by other Indians retreating deeper into the vanishing jungle: a group of eight or nine men on one occasion, a smaller group several days earlier, Survival International reported in a release Friday. The problems for the larger Ayoreo ethnic group, who share a common language and culture and can be found in Bolivia and Paraguay, started about 50 years ago. Between 1959 and 1987, most Ayoreos were forced off their ancestral land, according to the World Rainforest Movement, which describes itself as international network of citizens' groups involved in efforts to defend the world's rainforests. About 2,000 Ayoreos live in 13 settlements: 10 in Bolivia and three in Paraguay, the rainforest group says. Only the Totobiegosode tribe still lives in the forest, without contact with other Ayoreos or foreigners, in an area known as Amotocodie. Although no one has any direct contact with the Totobiegosode still in the jungle, their presence can be seen by such signs as footprints and holes in trees that indicate they have been gathering honey, the rainforest group says. There also have been occasional sightings in the distance. Mazower said he interviewed a small group of Totobiegosode who made contact with the outside world in 2004 and who described what their life is like. ""We were always running,"" Mazower said one Indian told him. ""We would suddenly hear these bulldozers. We thought that it was a kind of monster that could smell us. We could see fire. We were very afraid, and we ran."" The bulldozers, Mazower said, are much larger than the commercial bulldozers seen at construction sites. Often, crews will string a chain between two bulldozers, which will move in tandem to cut down an increased number of trees. As a result, many groups of Totobiegosode are fragmented into isolated patches as they scatter, divided by areas with no forest and increasingly busy roads. Families can be separated, and their lives become increasingly difficult, Mazower said. By Survival International's reckoning, the forest where the Totobiegosode live is being destroyed at a faster rate than the Amazon jungle as a whole. Despite Thursday's ruling, some observers say the future of tribes still living in the jungle in Paraguay and elsewhere, particularly Brazil, does not bode well. ""It's almost impossible in some sense to protect these tribes,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy center. The reason, he said, is the same as it has been since the Western world started being colonized more than 500 years ago: ""There's a lot of money to be made.""","Totobiegosode tribe is among last uncontacted Indians in South America .

"(CNN) -- In December, Facebook routinely lets users revisit the year by highlighting some their most popular posts and photos in an online scrapbook assembled in part from ""likes"" and comments. In the case of Eric Meyer, Facebook's algorithm brought back painful memories -- and prompted the company to apologize. Meyer, a Web consultant, lost his 6-year-old daughter, Rebecca, in June. When Facebook showed him his suggested year in review, his late daughter's photo was at the center. ""Yes, my year looked like that. True enough. My year looked like the now-absent face of my little girl,"" Meyer wrote in a Christmas Eve post on his blog. ""It was still unkind to remind me so forcefully."" Meyer didn't blame the algorithms; they're ""essentially thoughtless,"" he observed. But, he suggested, Facebook's human side could have tempered their flaws. ""Where the human aspect fell short, at least with Facebook, was in not providing a way to opt out. The Year in Review ad keeps coming up in my feed, rotating through different fun-and-fabulous backgrounds, as if celebrating a death, and there is no obvious way to stop it,"" he wrote. ""The design is for the ideal user, the happy, upbeat, good-life user. It doesn't take other use cases into account."" Meyer wasn't the only one who was upset by the Year in Review's briskly automatic construction. Other users chimed in on Twitter with their displeasure. ""Won't be sharing my Facebook Year in Review, which 'highlights' a post on a friend's death in May despite words like 'killed' and 'sad day,' "" wrote Time magazine's Andrew Katz. ""(M)y preview came up with my little boy & 'it's been a great year, thanks for being a part of it' He died at 15mos in Nov,"" wrote peitaballerina in response. Facebook, which has created an ""Empathy Team"" to help its employees think of users as, well, people, apologized to Meyer. ""(The app) was awesome for a lot of people, but clearly in this case we brought him grief rather than joy,"" Year in Review product manager Jonathan Gheller told the Washington Post. ""We can do better -- I'm very grateful he took the time in his grief to write the blog post."" After his first post gained attention -- and invited a lot of unpleasant commentary -- Meyer, in turn, apologized to the company in a compassionate follow-up. ""I owe the Year in Review team in specific, and Facebook in general, an apology. No, not the other way around,"" he wrote. ""I am very sorry that I dropped the Internet on (Gheller's) head for Christmas. He and his team didn't deserve it."" The solution, he adds, isn't to harp on the coders or designers, who often don't fit the stereotypes commenters ascribed to them. It's to ""anticipate how a design decision that really worked in one way completely failed in another, and work to handle both cases,"" he wrote. ""This is such a common failure that it's almost not a failure any more. It just ... is,"" he added. ""We need to challenge that 'is.' I've fallen victim to it myself. We all have. We all will. It will take time, practice, and a whole lot of stumbling to figure out how to do better, but it is, I submit, vitally important that we do.""","Facebook upsets some with ""Year in Review"" option .

"One of the true benefits of my job as an international business correspondent is meeting larger than life government and business leaders that are at the top of their game.  It would be difficult to find one that left a more lasting impression than Christophe de Margerie, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Total. De Margerie died tragically when his Dassault Falcon 50 hit a snow plow at an airport in Russia.  He was doing what he did best, pursuing a $27 billion deal when the country was out of favor with the West.  De Margerie had just finished a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a dacha to discuss a Siberian gas deal with local partner, Novatek. I met de Margerie shortly after he took over the reins as chief executive in 2007. As the former president of the Middle East division of Total, he kept a high profile in the region with two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves. I had the pleasure of interviewing him several times, the last at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June.  While most CEOs avoided Vladimir Putin's version of Davos altogether, those that were there stayed well away from public sessions and the limelight. Not de Margerie.  He sat on the front row during the main energy session to illustrate he was not intimidated by U.S. and EU sanctions.  Before the session was over, I went up and asked if he was willing to talk.  ""Why not?"" was his reply as his press representative peered at me with alarm.  My one-on-one quickly became a mini press conference. It was classic de Margerie, warmly known as Mr. Moustache due to the giant walrus-sized patch that was his trademark.  Behind his larger than life appearance and presence was a shrewd oil and gas man, who loved to take Total into new frontiers, even if it meant courting controversy in Africa, Iraq and most notably Iran. De Margerie was a scion of a champagne dynasty, the Tattinger family.  Right after graduating from the Ecole Superieure de Commerce business school in 1974,  he went to work for Total where he stayed for 30 impressionable years.

"(CNN) -- Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden ripped into recent comments by his Republican counterpart that suggested that some places in the U.S. are more ""pro-America"" than others. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin holds a rally Friday in West Chester, Ohio. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin told a fundraiser in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday night: . ""We believe that the best of America is in the small towns that we get to visit, and in the wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America, being here with all of you hard-working, very patriotic, very pro-America areas of this great nation,"" she said. ""This is where we find the kindness and the goodness and the courage of everyday Americans,"" Palin added. On Friday, Palin clarified her comments. ""It's all pro-America. I was just reinforcing the fact that there, where I was, there's good patriotic people there in these rallies, so excited about positive change and reform of government that's coming that they are so appreciative of hearing our message, hearing our plan. Not any one area of America is more pro-America patriotically than others,"" she said. At a rally in Mesilla, New Mexico, on Friday, Biden responded to those comments in a vociferous tone. ""I hope it was just a slip on her part and she doesn't really mean it. But she said, it was reported she said, that she likes to visit, 'pro-American' parts of the country,"" he said to loud boos. ""It doesn't matter where you live, we all love this country, and I hope it gets through. We all love this country,"" he said. ""We are one nation, under God, indivisible. We are all patriotic. We all love our country in every part of this nation! And I'm tired. I am tired, tired, tired, tired of the implications about patriotism."" Meanwhile, the presidential campaigns were on the offensive Friday, with Sen. Barack Obama criticizing Sen. John McCain's health care plan and Palin scrutinizing Obama's ties to a community activist group. The candidates and their running mates were spread out across the country, with Palin traveling to Ohio and Indiana; McCain in Florida; and Biden in New Mexico and Nevada. Obama was in Virginia, a traditional Republican state that has not backed a Democrat for president since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. But according to a CNN/TIME/Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted October 11-14, Obama has opened up a 10-point lead over McCain, 53 percent to 43 percent. At a campaign rally in Roanoke, Obama compared McCain's health care proposals to drug advertising.  Watch more of Obama's comments » . ""It's like those ads for prescription drugs. They start out and everybody's running in the fields and everybody's happy, then there's a little fine print that says, you know, the side effects they may include,"" Obama said to laughter from the crowd. He also highlighted McCain's plan to tackle the Medicare system, which provides health benefits for senior citizens and others. ""It turns out, Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare -- $882 billion worth ... to pay for an ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care to people -- even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall,"" he said. Shortly after Obama's speech, McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement that unlike Obama's ""risky plan,"" McCain's plans ""do not punish struggling businesses with fines and taxes, and they certainly do not cut a single benefit for Medicare or Medicaid -- Obama is simply lying."" According to McCain's Web site, the Arizona senator wants to ""reform the payment systems in Medicaid and Medicare to compensate providers for diagnosis, prevention and care coordination. Medicaid and Medicare should not pay for preventable medical errors or mismanagement."" McCain also returned to the campaign trail Friday, traveling to Florida -- a state the Republicans won in the last two presidential elections.

The group -- the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- faces allegations of filing fraudulent voter registrations in Nevada and faces investigations in other states. Palin, campaigning in the battleground state of Ohio, told a crowd in West Chester that Obama ""won't tell you the full truth ... on his connections to ACORN ... under investigation for rampant voter fraud."" The FBI confirmed Tuesday that it is investigating ACORN's registration efforts. Palin accused the group of ""rampant voter fraud,"" although technically it is being accused of voter registration fraud. ""In this election, especially here in Ohio, you're going to be asked to choose between a candidate who will not disavow a group committing voter fraud and a leader who will not tolerate it,"" Palin said. Brian Mellor, an ACORN attorney in Boston, Massachusetts, said the group has its own quality control process and has fired workers in the past -- including workers in Gary, Indiana. But he said allegations that his organization committed fraud is a government attempt to keep people disenfranchised. ""We believe their purpose is to attack ACORN and suppress votes,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- More than 1,600 people within a 10-mile stretch of central Florida's Atlantic beaches have been stung in the past week by a distinctive species of jellyfish not indigenous to North America, a rescue official said Tuesday. Brevard County Ocean Rescue officials said they began flying warning flags at beaches from Cocoa Beach to Cape Canaveral last Tuesday, indicating either a medium or high hazard, along with another flag indicating dangerous marine life. ""From last Wednesday to Friday, we got about 600 reports. Saturday to (Tuesday), we got another thousand,"" Chief Jeff Scabarozi said. Monty Graham, a scientist at Alabama's Dauphin Island Sea Lab, said the jellyfish appear to be what are known as mauve stingers, a species that often blooms in response to small climate cycles like El Niño. ""The interesting thing about these jellyfish is that they're very sporadic. They occur in heavy numbers, but not every year,"" he said. Graham said the last time he had seen such a widespread outbreak in the United States was more than a decade ago. ""They're much more common in the Mediterranean,"" he said. ""Probably what we're seeing is a large population bloom in the Gulf of Mexico transported by the Gulf Stream wrapping around the coast of Florida."" All weekend long, countless numbers of jellyfish washed up on shores, standing out against the sand due to their characteristic purplish-reddish hue. Graham said that although mauve stingers are smaller and much less familiar than the Portuguese man o' war and cannonball jellyfish that often wash up on Florida shores, the ruddy-colored animal can pack a punch. ""While they might be small, they're actually pretty potent. And unlike the others, these animals actually have stinging cells up on the top of their bells in addition to the stingers on their tentacles, which is uncommon."" When stung, mauve stinger victims may see a discoloration on their skin where contact was made, Graham said. ""These guys will leave actual marks on you sometimes. It may stay with you for quite some time, but over time it will go away."" The stings cause itching, burning and rashes and can sometimes spur an allergic reaction. Although none of the stings reported in Brevard County was believed to be serious, officials said two people who were stung were taken to hospitals after suffering from respiratory distress. It was unclear whether the distress was directly caused by the stings or came from a pre-existing medical condition. Most victims were being treated by a vinegar solution stocked at the various lifeguard stations. Despite the abundance of visible jellyfish in the water, many trying to enjoy the Memorial Day weekend took their chances -- and suffered the repercussions. ""We've already gone through about 25 gallons of vinegar. Even so, a lot of people didn't go into the water,"" Scabarozi said. ""I just want to know when they're going to leave.""","The jellyfish are visitors to central Florida's Atlantic beaches .

"(CNN) -- Two imams heading to a conference on prejudice against Muslims said they were forced off their North Carolina-bound flight to undergo an additional security check -- only to have the pilot take off without them, even after they were cleared. Atlantic Southeast Airlines said in a statement that it was investigating the incident, which took place Friday night aboard a flight out of Memphis, Tennessee. Masudur Rahman and Mohamed Zaghloul, both imams in the Memphis area, were clad in Islamic attire when they were told to leave the aircraft as it was taxiing toward the runway. Their lawyer, Mo Idlibi, told CNN on Saturday that neither man had done anything out of the ordinary, nor were they praying or chanting. Rahman, who is also a professor of Arabic at the University of Memphis, said he and his colleague cooperated throughout the process and thanked Transportation Security Administration agents and others for their kindness and courtesy. But he said, through intermediaries, that they had difficulty finding out why they were ever kicked off the plane. One representative of Delta Air Lines, who claimed to be advocating on the two men's behalf, came out visibly red-faced after a long talk with the pilot, according to Rahman. This was after the plane had returned to the gate and Rahman and Zaghoul had gotten off and gone through a secondary screening process. Shortly thereafter, the plane took off -- without the men, who hadn't been allowed back on board. ""He didn't give any reason,"" said Rahman, referring to the pilot. ""(The representative) said only that the pilot is not allowing you to go."" Atlantic Southeast Airlines, which runs Delta Connection and United Express flights, apologized ""for any inconvenience that this may have caused."" Atlantic Southeast did not say why the two men were taken off the flight, but did claim they were given the opportunity to fly on a different flight. ""Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 5452 from Memphis to Charlotte returned to the gate to allow for additional screening of a passenger and the passenger's companion,"" the statement said. ""We take security and safety very seriously, and the event is currently under investigation."" Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the civil rights group Council on American-Islamic Relations, told CNN the two men contacted his office and said they were told that other passengers did not want them on board the small commuter plane. ""TSA came on and pulled them off and said the pilot was refusing to fly with them because passengers were uncomfortable with them,"" Hooper said, referring to the Transportation Security Administration. Earlier, Rahman told CNN affiliate WCNC that the incident reminded him of the prejudice Rosa Parks faced during the civil rights movement. ""That history I found today in that plane, and it shouldn't happen with any other person,"" he said. Incidentally, the two men -- both of whom hold high religious positions in the Memphis community, with Zaghloul being an imam at Masjid Al-Noor -- were headed to a conference on Islamophobia. The meeting is sponsored by the North American Imams Federation. Rahman, with Zaghloul by his side, eventually got to North Carolina and talked to CNN from there. The men's attorney said they have not yet decided whether to sue the airline or anyone else involved in the case. ""We're keeping all options open,"" Idlibi said. ""We do want to make sure that the pilot is held accountable for his actions."" CNN's Rick Martin, Craig Bell and Maria Ebrahimji contributed to this report.","An imam says he initially wasn't given a reason he was kicked off a plane .

"(CNN)The United States conducted an airstrike Monday in Somalia against Al-Shabaab, said Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, Pentagon press secretary. The strike, which took place in the area of Saakow, was targeting a senior leader of the Islamist militant group. ""At this time, we do not assess there to be any civilian or bystander casualties. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information, when appropriate, as details become available,"" Kirby said in a statement. The strike was carried out by an unmanned aircraft, and was an operation of the U.S. Defense Department, according to a U.S. defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. On Saturday, Somalia government forces captured a top Al-Shabaab commander, said two of the country's military officials. Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi, Al-Shabaab's intelligence chief, was captured in a house near the town of El Wak, Somali military commander Isack Hussein Mursal told state-run radio. He was a close associate of former Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city in September. The capture came after militants with the group, which is linked to al Qaeda, attacked a large African Union base in Mogadishu last week, killing three Ugandan soldiers and a civilian. Al-Shabaab has said that attack was revenge for the U.S. airstrike that killed Godane. The State Department had offered a $7 million reward for information on Godane's location. CNN's Omar Nor and Susanna Capelouto contributed to this report.","An unmanned aircraft carried out the strike, says a U.S. official .

"It's become another military euphemism, along with ""collateral damage"" and ""friendly fire."" The ""knock on the roof"" is the Israeli military's warning for civilians before it fires on a building and is being used extensively as Israeli airstrikes target Hamas sites in Operation Protective Edge. The Israeli Air Force developed the technique in 2009 as a way to warn civilians in Gaza to leave buildings it has identified as locations where Hamas keeps ammunition, a rocket stash or command post. But it is a controversial policy that has been criticized by human rights groups. The procedure generally begins with a phone call to the occupants to leave a building, according to Relik Shafir, a retired brigadier general in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and a former fighter pilot. Such places, he says, are often under constant surveillance, and the IDF has a sense of how many people live there, and how many leave. If it is still unclear whether a building is occupied, a missile that carries little or no explosive load is aimed at the roof of a building. The impact is felt, but it rarely causes casualties. ""It's meant to get people to take us seriously,"" says Shafir. There is no standard gap between the delivery of the ""dummy"" missile and fully armed missiles, says Shafir. It can be minutes or even hours. It depends on how important the target is. But there are hundreds or even thousands of such places in Gaza, chosen by Hamas precisely because they complicate targeting. One dramatic example of the ""knock on the roof"" appeared on social media Sunday. Distributed by the Gaza-based Watania news agency, it showed at first the impact of an unarmed rocket or missile on the roof of a house. Smoke rose from the roof; curtains billowed from an open window. Some time later -- Watania says about 15 minutes  -- two missiles slammed into the building, blowing out the facade and sending debris and thick smoke across a wide area. It's not clear whether the occupants of the house had heeded the warning -- it may have been empty -- but no one was hurt. But human rights groups have condemned the technique -- despite the precautions. What you need to know about the country of Israel . A warning or an attack? ""In some but not all cases, families receive telephone calls from the Israeli military in advance,"" said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International. ""There is no way that firing a missile at a civilian home can constitute an effective 'warning.' Amnesty International has documented cases of civilians killed or injured by such missiles in previous Israeli military operations on the Gaza Strip,"" he said. Human rights groups in Gaza agree. ""The sending of a missile cannot be considered a warning. It is the targeting of civilians with a weapon, regardless of how small, and it is a violation of the Geneva conventions,"" said Mahmoud Abu Rahma of the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights. ""Imagine you are in Gaza and there are airstrikes everywhere, and many families are in the bottom floor of their home,"" Abu Rahma added. ""Families miss the sound of the 'warning' missile because it sounds like just another explosion."" CNN's Ben Wedeman, reporting from Shabilya Friday, visited one targeted house whose residents said no warning had been received. At another property that was also destroyed, a warning had been received. But the man living next door, Raouf Abu Odeh, told CNN he didn't get any warning -- and now half of his house is also in ruins. ""When I heard there was danger, we ran away with my family. We have no bomb shelters, we have nothing. All we can do is escape,"" Odeh said. It's not clear whether any warning was delivered by any means to the home of Gaza's police chief, Tayseer al-Batsh, on Saturday night. The missiles that hit his house killed 18 members of his extended family, including six children. When Wedeman and his team visited the ruins of the compound Monday, they found what appeared to be the reason it was targeted: evidence of reinforced tunnels. Shafir says the precision of such attacks has improved as crews have gained experience. ""The number of strikes has more than doubled compared to Operation Pillar of Defense (the 2012 conflict), but the number of casualties is about the same,"" he said. Dense area, deadly damage . But even in an era of precision targeting, the impact of missiles can't be restricted to one house in such a densely-populated area. Many of those injured in the strike on the al-Batsh compound were hit by shrapnel as they left an adjacent mosque. In other instances, people have gathered only a short distance from a building designated for attack -- not far enough away from flying concrete, wood and metal. And the United Nations says some 70% of those killed in the current conflict have been civilians . And there has been at least one deadly miscalculation. On July 8, eight civilians -- all members of the Kaware family -- were killed when their home in Khan Yunis was hit. According to the IDF, the family left the house after a phone warning but had returned home prematurely after a ""knock on the roof."" Perhaps they mistook it for the explosive missile. The property had been targeted because it belonged to Odeh Kaware, a senior official with the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigade. A senior air force officer told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that it was too late to prevent the airstrike that followed the warning.  ""There was nothing to be done, the munition was in the air and could not be diverted,"" he said. Some in Gaza have even put themselves in harm's way. Ten people were killed July 9 when they formed a human shield on the roof of another property belonging to the Kaware family, according to Palestinian medical and security sources. The ""knock on the roof"" technique was first used in the 2009 conflict in Gaza. But it was criticized by the United Nations-appointed Goldstone Commission that investigated the conduct of both sides in that fighting. The commission said it was ""not effective as a warning and constitutes a form of attack against the civilians inhabiting the building."" ""The fact that a warning was issued does not relieve a commander and his subordinates of taking all other feasible measures to distinguish between civilians and combatants,"" the commission's report said. Oren: A smart way out of the Gaza confrontation . Phone calls and leaflets . The Israeli military also uses telephone messages and leaflets to warn people in Gaza to leave neighborhoods where their forces  intend to target alleged Hamas facilities. On Saturday, the air force dropped thousands of leaflets across several neighborhoods in northern Gaza, warning people to leave their homes ahead of military operations against Hamas targets. ""Whoever does not adhere to these instructions and does not vacate their house immediately is subjecting their lives and the lives of their children and family to danger,"" it read. In past campaigns against Hamas, the Israeli military has also commandeered television and radio signals to issue warnings. Leaflets and phone messages were used in the 2008-09 and 2012 conflicts. They were partly political; blaming Hamas for the violence, and partly an attempt to clear areas where Israeli forces intended to focus strikes. During both conflicts, leaflets were dropped warning people not to come within 300 meters of the border. In 2012, leaflets warned residents that terrorist organizations were hiding among them and represented a direct threat to their lives. In 2008-09, according to an IDF report, some 2.5 million leaflets were dropped. One warned that ""anyone having ammunition and/or weapons in his home is risking his life and must leave the place for the safety of his own life and that of his family."" The same message was delivered in some 165,000 phone messages. The Goldstone Commission acknowledged ""significant efforts made by Israel"" in 2008-09 to alert Gaza residents to planned attacks, but said ""the lack of specificity and thus credibility"" of some of these messages had diminished their value. The leaflets can also have the effect of worsening an already difficult humanitarian situation. As people leave their homes in the current fighting, thousands end up in the care of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, in crowded schools. They must leave their livelihoods behind. Others say they have nowhere to go. ""These are more threats than warnings,"" says Abu Rahma of the Mezan Center. ""Telling 150,000 people to leave their homes when there are airstrikes all along the route and nowhere to go because every home in every place is a target."" Abu Odeh in Shabilya tells CNN, ""There's no escape."" ""God has sealed our fate, whether we stay or leave."" Cease-fire effort collapses as rockets, airstrikes continue .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- Dozens of gay and lesbian rights activists planning a parade in southwestern Moscow Saturday have been detained, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Gay and lesbian rights activists are detained in Moscow Saturday ahead of a planned march. The arrests included Nikolai Alexeyev, a prominent gay activist in Russia, and his associate Nikolai Bayev, Interfax said, adding that more people trickling into the location were being arrested without explanation. Officials of Moscow's gay community had announced earlier plans to rally at Novopushkinsky Park in central Moscow, Interfax said. The arrests came ahead of Saturday night's Eurovision Song Contest, which is being held in Moscow. The contest has a strong following among the gay and lesbian community.  Watch police break up the march » . Journalists from various countries gathered at the scene, as police barricaded the park with metal bars. Trucks with soldiers onboard were parked on nearby streets, Interfax said. UK gay human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, in a statement on his Web site ahead of the march, said it was being held to coincide with the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. ""This parade is in defense of human rights. We are defending the often violated human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Russians. They want legal protection against discrimination and hate crimes. I support their cause. ""Not all Russians are homophobic, but many are. Gay Russians suffer queer-bashing attacks, blackmail, verbal abuse and discrimination in education, housing and employment. This shames the great Russian nation."" The Eurovision Song Contest, which began in 1956, sees singers and groups from a short list of European nations perform a specially written song before telephone votes from each nation decide the winner. In western Europe, the contest is regard as a light entertainment spectacular, with a strong following among the gay and lesbian community. Many fans dress up, hold parties and gather round the TV to watch the three-hour-plus televised marathon. In recent years, however, eastern European nations, which take the contest much more seriously, have come to dominate. The contest is also known for its political edge, as nations either give zero points to traditional enemies -- or, if they are enjoying good relations, the maximum number of points, as a sign of friendship. The most famous winners of the contest were ABBA, who came to attention as the Swedish entry with ""Waterloo"" in 1974. In 1988, Celine Dion won the contest while singing on behalf of Switzerland. The dance show Riverdance first came to attention as an interval act when the contest was held in Dublin, Ireland, in 1994.

"U.S. Secretary of Commerce John Bryson, under investigation for possible felony hit-and-run after allegedly causing two weekend car accidents in California, will take a medical leave of absence ""as he undergoes tests and evaluations,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday night. A Commerce Department spokeswoman said earlier Monday that Bryson, 68, had suffered a seizure when the two accidents occurred Saturday. Police said Bryson was found unconscious at the wheel of his car on after the two accidents. Bryson was issued a citation at an area hospital where he received treatment, said Lt. Ariel Duran of the San Gabriel Police Department. Authorities must still decide whether to formally file any charges. Bryson voluntarily took a breathalyzer test that detected no alcohol use, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department confirmed Monday. Results from a separate blood alcohol test were pending, Duran said. A police statement Sunday said the investigation was in ""its preliminary stages,"" and that there was no indication of alcohol or drugs playing a role. ""Secretary Bryson was involved in a traffic accident in Los Angeles over the weekend,"" said a statement by Commerce Director of Public Affairs Jennifer Friedman. ""He suffered a seizure. He was taken to the hospital for examination and remained overnight for observation. He was released and has returned to Washington. The investigation is ongoing."" At the White House earlier Monday, Carney said Bryson has ""health-related issues that played a role"" in the weekend incident. Carney provided no further details, noting the Commerce Department statement about Bryson suffering a seizure. ""He was alone, he had a seizure, he was involved in"" the accidents, Carney said in explaining the difficulty in determining exactly what happened. In announcing Bryson's medical leave of absence Monday night, Carney said in a statement that Bryson had notified the White House of the leave and, ""The President's thoughts are with Secretary Bryson and his family during this time."" Neither Carney's statement nor his remarks earlier indicated whether Obama had spoken directly with Bryson since the accidents. According to a Commerce official, Bryson was on personal time with no security detail when the accidents occurred and was driving his own vehicle. The official, who spoke to CNN on condition of not being identified, said Bryson was given medication to treat the seizure. The Commerce official said Bryson flew back to Washington on Sunday night and was in the office Monday. Bryson, who never had a seizure before, is in touch with doctors who are monitoring his progress, the source said. Bryson has limited recall and the cause of the seizure, as well as the exact sequence of events, is not clear, the official said. An administration official, also speaking on condition of not being identified, told CNN the White House was notified Sunday night about what happened. Bryson, who was driving a Lexus, rear-ended a Buick occupied by three men that was stopped at a railroad crossing in San Gabriel, said the police statement Sunday. ""Bryson spoke with the males, then left the scene, hitting the same car again as he left,"" the statement said. The men in the Buick followed Bryson while calling 911 to report the accident, it said. Bryson then drove to the neighboring city of Rosemead, where he hit a second car, according to authorities. The commerce secretary was found ""alone and unconscious behind the wheel of his vehicle,"" according to the police statement. Paramedics treated him at the scene and took him to an area hospital, Duran said. Two of the three men in the Buick were treated for minor injuries, according to police. Bryson was cooperative with deputies when he ""came to,"" said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore. ""It's all under investigation, and it will be treated as we would treat any investigation such as this,"" he said. Obama nominated Bryson to succeed Gary Locke as commerce secretary in May 2011. ""As Commerce Secretary, John is going to be an important part of my economic team, promoting American business and American products across the globe,"" Obama said then. ""By working with companies here at home, and representing America's interests abroad, I'm confident that he's going to help us meet the goal that I set of doubling our nation's exports."" Bryson's Senate confirmation was delayed by Republican opposition. It eventually occurred in October and he became the 37th secretary of commerce. A graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School, Bryson served as chairman of the California utility company Edison International from 1990 until 2008. Before that, he was a co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group that strongly endorsed Bryson's nomination last  year.","Bryson will take a medical leave of absence, the White House announces .

"During Tuesday night's State of the Union address, President Barack Obama touted his administration's efforts on reducing illegal immigration. The claim: . ""Real reform means stronger border security, and we can build on the progress my administration has already made -- putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history, and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years."" That's a big claim, so CNN decided to take a closer look. The facts: . In fiscal year 2011, there were 18,506 U.S. Border Patrol agents in the Southwest Border Sectors -- up steadily from 3,555 agents in 1992, according to Customs and Border Protection figures. A Pew Research Hispanic Center study finds that Border Patrol apprehensions of all unauthorized immigrants are at their lowest level since 1971. ""In spite of (and perhaps because of) increases in the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents, apprehensions of Mexicans trying to cross the border illegally have plummeted in recent years—from more than 1 million in 2005 to 286,000 in 2011—a likely indication that fewer unauthorized migrants are trying to cross,"" it concluded. More fact checks: Obamacare | Gas mileage | Wind energy . Pew estimates that net migration -- newly arrived immigrants minus those leaving (forced or voluntarily) -- has come to a standstill, which it attributes to the weakened U.S. job and construction markets, border enforcement, an increase in deportations, and increased dangers associated with crossing the border. In all, there were 327,577 illegal immigrant apprehensions in 2011, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. This is the lowest number since 1972, when there were 321,326. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the 2011 figure is a 53% drop from 2008, which it says indicates that fewer people are trying to cross the border. The figures can be tough to interpret. Often, the same person is caught more than once, ""and then the flip side of that phenomenon is there's no way of knowing how many you missed counting, how many do get through,"" said Dan Kowalski, editor of Bender's Immigration Bulletin and an immigration lawyer at the Fowler Law Firm in Austin, Texas. ""So, you get what you measure. In other words, you count what you count."" But even if the border could be sealed in a foolproof manner, the issue of illegal immigration would not be resolved. That's because many of those people who are in the United States without authorization have entered the country legally on a visa and simply overstayed their visa status, Kowalski said. Conclusion: . Obama's comments appear to accurately summarize the current state of illegal immigration, though it's impossible to determine with certainty how many illegal crossings may have occurred.","In fiscal year 2011, there were 18,506 U.S. Border Patrol agents in the Southwest Border Sectors .

"No one knew how the little girl ended up alone, in the Indiana field. Nor did they know who the toddler with blond hair and blue eyes was. They did know that she needed help. So the rush was on Friday to help the girl after she was found in Salem after devastating tornadoes struck the area, Clark County Sheriff's Department Maj. Chuck Adams said. Adams said the 20-month-old was intubated, with a tube inserted into her throat to help her breathe. She was taken first to Indiana's St. Vincent Salem Hospital before being flown about 35 miles southeast to Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, according to Brian Rublein, a spokesman for Kosair. ""She is in critical condition,"" Rublein said Saturday night. Rublein and Adams said that, since the girl was first located, someone had called to identify her. The hospital spokesman added Saturday that extended family members were then with the child. But her entire immediate family -- her parents, as well as 3-year-old brother and 2-month-old sister -- were killed in the storm, according to Rublein. Those wishing to help can do so through the hospital's website, www.kosairchildrens.com, by specifying they want their donation to be directed to the girl who lost her family in the storm. As uncertain as this toddler's fate was, the situation was likewise tenuous for a 9-year-old boy from Henryville, about 20 miles east of Salem. Adams said that the boy's whereabouts have been unknown since twisters ravaged his Indiana town, destroying its high school, knocking down trees and tearing roofs off buildings. With lights knocked out throughout the region due to the potent storm, authorities were using thermal imaging and search dogs in an attempt to locate the boy, according to Adams. As of Saturday evening, authorities were reporting that at least 37 people had died as a result of the severe weather, including 18 in Kentucky and 14 in Indiana.","The girl's parents and 2 siblings died in the storm, a hospital official says .

In late November, many found their entertainment lifeline cut off as authorities shut down two of the country's most popular file-sharing sites -- one with countless episodes of U.S. TV series, and the other with meticulously translated Chinese subtitles for those shows. State media called the sites known copyright infringers. The sites themselves claimed to be free platforms for people who want to learn about American language and culture -- not money-making ventures. Worse still, fans quickly realized their only viable alternative -- China's legitimate video streaming sites  -- may soon fall victim to the censors' tightening grip. Fleeting optimism . Almost no current U.S. TV series air on China's broadcast and cable networks. In February, viewers and critics hailed the release of hit political thriller ""House of Cards"" on video site Sohu at the same time it aired on Netflix in the U.S. as a sign of liberalization in China's strictly-controlled media market. Many Sohu users binge-watched all 13 episodes of the second season, which appeared uncensored despite unflattering story lines about China's ruling Communist elite. It had clocked more than 103 million views by mid-December, more than double Netflix's 50 million global subscribers. But the sense of optimism among fans quickly dissipated when in April, without warning, the government banned four popular American TV series -- including the top-rated sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory"" -- on all streaming sites. Officials cited violations of copyrights laws and content regulations without giving specifics, even though the shows had been purchased and allowed to stream online for several seasons. Stockpiling shows . Fans are bracing for more disappointment. China's broadcast regulator has strongly hinted from April 2015 it would only approve ""healthy"" content to be streamed online -- a troubling prospect for followers of such shows as zombie horror drama ""The Walking Dead"" and steamy period drama ""Masters of Sex."" What's more, online broadcasters may have to wait for a show's entire season to air in the U.S. before streaming it in China. Hardcore followers say they dread the prospect of having to wait to watch chopped versions of their beloved shows on streaming sites. Many young, urban and well-educated fans insist, given the rising government restrictions, only illicit file-sharing services offer the quick and unfettered access they crave. ""I've been stockpiling shows by downloading as much as possible -- it's the only way to make me feel safe,"" explained Zhao Tianshu, 30, a Beijing lawyer who considers watching American legal dramas like ""The Good Wife"" -- one of the four shows banned in April -- on his iPad in the gym a daily highlight. ""I understand copyright concerns, but the policy just seems arbitrary,"" said Feng Huiling, 23, a social work graduate student in the Chinese capital who breathlessly lists more than a dozen American TV shows that she regularly watches. Ideological threat? What alarms censors, fans and analysts argue, is the immense popularity of those shows -- with a new episode often attracting millions of views or downloads within hours. ""The following used to be small -- but now it's gotten so huge that officials become nervous about the impact and feel compelled to do something about it,"" said Wu Yeni, 32, a Beijing-based corporate publicist who compares watching American TV series to getting a cup of Starbucks coffee --  another of her addictions. Jeremy Goldkorn, a leading commentator on China's media landscape, said it was surprising how American TV series posted on Chinese video sites had been allowed to proliferate with very little government interference. ""They are now putting these measures in place to make sure it doesn't become an ideological threat,"" he said. ""This helps them better micromanage the content and frighten Internet companies into complying with regulations."" Even shows that manage to get into China sometimes disappear. ""Madam Secretary,"" a new political drama that debuted this past autumn, is widely streamed online in China. Nowhere to be found, however, is its fourth episode, which features some of China's taboo subjects: the Tiananmen crackdown, the one-child policy, and a territorial dispute between China and Japan. People will wearily accept the ""new normal"" of rising censorship under an increasingly powerful and hardline President Xi Jinping, predicts Goldkorn. ""Anybody associated with thought work or ideology or the image of China -- everything is being squeezed or tightened or limited,"" he said. New normal . Goldkorn also said the new rules have a commercial rationale. ""They don't want people to get too hooked on foreign shows and not to watch any Chinese content."" Long Danni, the president of EE-Media, a major entertainment company based in Shanghai, told CNN that the new policies help domestic TV producers like her. ""We'll have plenty more high-quality original programming to conquer not just the Chinese but the global market."" Fans of American TV are not so sure. For now, many try to explore technical workarounds to new government restrictions and insist that, no matter what happens, they won't watch domestic shows known for their over-the-top propaganda and low production values. ""If they totally shut the door to American TV, it would be tragic,"" said Wu, the corporate publicist who equates her desire for U.S. shows to that for caffeine. ""It would be just tragic if you couldn't even choose your own entertainment.""","Hit U.S. TV shows have many fans in China .

"Multiple sources close to Jeb Bush say the former Florida governor's recent public appearances in which, he seems to be thinking out loud about a possible presidential run are actually very similar to the private discussions he is having with friends and colleagues. ""The public conversation is what he has been saying to us. He is honestly struggling with this decision,"" says a source familiar with the process, who argues it is ""real,"" unlike some other GOP contenders who have decided to run, but won't say so. ""He's doing this in a thoughtful way, and he hasn't made up his mind."" And while Bush, as a potential presidential candidate, if often critiqued as someone out of touch with his own party, another source claims that consideration is not a part of the Bush equation. ""He doesn't worry about whether he's in tune with his party,"" this source says. ""He knows what he believes."" Indeed, adds another source, ""he would fully expect and welcome a fight."" In fact, in his recent appearance before a Wall Street Journal CEO Council event, Bush mused that the GOP nominee needs to be willing to ""lose the primary to win the general (election) without violating your principles."" That's a not-so-veiled reference to what many believe occurred in Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, and recognition of Bush's own problems with the base of his party, which has balked at his stands on both immigration reform and the common core education standards for schools. Sources also say that while Bush has said he will decide in ""short order"" — perhaps sometime early in the New Year — a decision will likely not come in a major announcement. Instead, one source says, ""he could send some signals."" In campaign parlance, that could mean the hiring of staff, forming an exploratory committee or formally soliciting money. Or simply say he's leaning towards a run or against it. While top Bush advisers have been gathering data on what a run would entail, no commitments have been made or asked of potential staff or supporters, one source says. Rather, the conversations have been ""if he decides to run would you talk further with us,"" this source says. On the personal side, Bush's concerns seem twofold according to multiple sources. First, as one puts it ""how can I best protect my family?"" In the WSJ forum, Bush himself put it this way: ""Can I do it where the sacrifice for my family is tolerable ... it's a pretty ugly business right now,"" he said. ""There's a level under which I would never subjugate my family because that's my organizing principle. That's my life. I think people kind of appreciate that. So, I'm sorting that out."" Second, another source adds, Bush is concerned, as he has said previously, that a campaign ought to be ""joyful and full of value."" Translation: Bush needs to make sure he is willing to campaign daily for two years because of his love for country, party and commitment to the his issue set — immigration and education reform, tax changes, energy policy, regulatory policy. It's also clear that Bush is weighing the strain of daily campaign in a 24/7 media cycle in which everything he says will be relentlessly scrutinized. In his appearance before the WSJ conference, he made several telling asides about being ""fact-checked"" as if to underscore the media spotlight — and fishbowl life — that accompanies a presidential candidacy. What Bush is clearly not shying away from is any engagement on the issues. At the WSJ forum, Bush said congressional Republicans need to lead without grandstanding. ""We don't have to make a point any more as Republicans,"" Bush told the CEO-filled audience. ""... We have to actually show that we can, in an adult-like way, we can govern, lead.""","Sources close to Jeb Bush say that the former governor is not worried about a primary fight .
Those same sources say Bush is concerned about the toll a bid would put on him family ."
"Eurovision -- the curious annual song contest that sees a continent united around its televisions for an evening of high-energy songs, spangled costumes and ill-advised drinking games -- is once more upon us. Founded in 1956, it was intended as a way to bring together once-warring nations through the innocent medium of pop music. It hasn't necessarily ended the rivalries (the voting-based results system is notoriously territorial), but for the hundreds of millions watching on TV, Eurovision is a well-rehearsed, almost comforting routine. It's less comforting, however, for the competitors and fans dispatched to an unfamiliar city -- this year's Grand Final will be held May 10 at the B&W Grand Ballroom in Copenhagen -- to uphold or betray national honor with only leotard-clad backing dancers for company. Copenhagen: 10 Things to know before you go . Help is at hand, though. Herewith our insiders' guide to maximizing post-Eurovision joy, or minimizing sorrow, in the Danish capital. Drinking and dancing . Copenhagen is compact for a major capital, with a shade over half a million inhabitants, but it's increasingly famed for nightlife, especially in the Meatpacking District -- just like the similarly scenester-filled area of New York -- near the central station. Here the nightlife concentration is sufficiently dense to allow disgruntled central European crooners to stumble from bar to club. For those determined to dance, locals suggest KB18 (Kodboderne 18; +45 33 313 933), or Culture Box (Kronprinsessegade 54; +45 33 325 050). Slightly closer to the contest's harbor-side venue is the dingy but welcoming Eiffel Bar (Wildersgade 18; + 45 32 577 092) in Christianshavn, a possible home-from-home for this year's face fur-fixated French entry, Twin Twin. The walls are covered in Parisian iconography and the beer is dirt cheap. The more adventurous could venture to one of the city's most defiantly hip nightclubs, Sunday (Lille Kongensgade 16; +45 53 668 228), which boasts an in-house team of Thai transgender dancers and a mission to -- their words -- ""push the borders of wicked indecency."" Eating . Enough about Noma, already. The seashore-foraging, micro-herb-arranging repeat winner of the best restaurant in the world crown is undeniably astounding. But the chances of getting a table are roughly the same as Portugal's prospects of ever winning Eurovision (this year's entrant, Suzy, was kicked out in the semi-finals, adding to half a century of failure). Perhaps off limits too are various offshoots such as Amass, run by a former Noma head chef, or Bror, where the specialty is braised lamb's head with whipped brain and stuffed eyeballs -- which sounds almost as tricky to digest as Latvia's saccharine Eurovision entry. Danish restaurant Noma named the world's best . A better bet is smorrebrod, the traditional Danish open sandwiches that are escaping their lunchtime roots and entering the world of fine dining. Smorrebrod and 10 more new American sandwich heroes . Many of the better known outlets tend to be booked up, but you can try Dyrehaven (Sonder Boulevard 72)off Vesterbro in the city center, which doesn't take reservations and attracts a fashionable crowd. For more basic fare still, there's always Copenhagen's many and famous hot dog stands. Harry's Place (Nordre Fasanvej 269) is a little ways outside the center, but locals make the trip for both the sausages and the trademark chili sauce, known as krudt -- the Danish word for gunpowder. Same-sex marriage . Not for everyone, obviously, and arguably a little hard to arrange on a night out. Nevertheless, this is one of the Eurovision-based attractions promoted by Copenhagen officials. Throughout the Eurovision weekend the city is encouraging any couples to tie the knot. Ceremonies can be held on a specially arranged ""wedding boat"" cruising the harbor. The marriages are intended to mark both the 25th anniversary of same-sex civil partnerships in Denmark -- the first country in the world to permit them -- and Eurovision's open-minded reputation. With its focus on flamboyant acts and tight sequined outfits, the contest has always had a decidedly camp air, a reputation sealed when Dana International, an Israeli transgender woman, won in 1998. Her mantle has been passed this year to Austria's entrant, Conchita Wurst, the bearded drag alter ego of singer Tom Neuwirth. Cycling . Something of a Danish cliche, perhaps -- the city has one of the highest rates of bike use in the world -- but stick with us, because Eurovision 2014 needs all the environmental help it can get. Most bike-friendly cities in the United States . This year's event had proudly branded itself the greenest contest ever -- until newspapers discovered electricity for the venue itself is being provided by 26 very large, very smelly diesel generators. Contestants can pedal serenely away from the fumes, and the humiliation of being beaten by Malta's Mumford and Sons-lite entry, Firelight, on Copenhagen's famous network of segregated bike lanes. Organizers are laying on fleets of bikes for Eurovision use, and the city is littered with rental shops. (Rent A Bike Copenhagen, Adelgade 11; +45 32 12 50 50 and Gasværksvej 5;+45 50 32 11 00). For those feeling particularly homesick -- or humiliated -- the city's airport, only about six miles from the center, is connected by yet more of those ubiquitous bike lanes. The Little Mermaid . While arguably the most iconic symbol of Copenhagen, the bronze statue of Hans Christian Andersen's famous fairy tale character is underwhelming in real life, standing little more than a meter tall. Five places to find mermaids . Her harbor-side location, however, is restful -- the perfect place to sit and contemplate what might have been had the seams on the lead dancer's costume held together a little longer. It's a place to consider also that even if Copenhagen's attractions aren't enough, things could have been much, much more sedate. The capital won its bid to host the event against a series of notably smaller Danish locations. Among them was Herning, a city on Denmark's Jutland peninsula whose tourist information board lists ""libraries"" as among the chief attractions.","This year's annual Eurovision song contest is being held in Copenhagen .

"As the country heads into the Memorial Day weekend,  there are still almost 1.5 million U.S soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines deployed in war zones or combat missions worldwide. So far, more than 6,700 U.S. servicemen and women have died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and at least 50,000 more have been wounded. Here is a look at the numbers behind the sacrifices of American military veterans of current and past wars: . More than 8,100 -- Number of coalition troops who have died during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; almost all of them -- about 6,700 -- are U.S. troops. 623 -- Number of troops from Britain who have died in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Britain has the second highest number of fatalities behind the United States. 175 -- Number of coalition servicewomen who have died in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. 156 - Number of U.S. servicewomen who have died in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. More than 50,000 -- Number of U.S. troops who have been wounded in action during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, according to the Pentagon. At least 3,275 -- Number of coalition troops who have died in improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. It is the leading cause of fatalities. 50 -- Countries that contributed troops to Operation Enduring Freedom through NATO/International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and related regions. At least 36 -- Number of countries that have lost troops in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 3,000 -- Number of coalition force deaths since the start of the war in Afghanistan. Approx. 620,000 -- Combined troops killed during the Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865. 63 -- Percent of Union troop deaths caused by disease during the Civil War. 90 -- State and local chapters of Rolling Thunder, a national group participating since 1988 in Memorial Day weekend bike rides to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C. 6 -- Number of wreaths engraved on the sides of the Tomb of the Unknowns, in Arlington National Cemetery. Each wreath recognizes a major campaign of World War I. 58,000+ -- Names inscribed on the walls of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, of U.S. troops who died serving in the Vietnam War. 8 -- Women's names on the memorial. 24 -- Notes in ""Taps,"" the bugle call traditionally played at the end of a military funeral. 3 -- Number of rifle volleys fired over the grave during interment. 3,461 -- Recipients of the Medal of Honor, the highest honor for valor in action. 80 -- Living Medal of Honor recipients. 38 -- The number of statues there appear to be, including the reflections on the wall, at the Korean War Memorial, symbolizing the length of the war, 38 months, and the 38th parallel that divides North and South Korea; 34,000 U.S. troops were killed.","More than 6,700 U.S. troops have died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .

"The spokesman for the Ferguson, Missouri, police department is on unpaid leave and facing disciplinary action after reportedly describing the memorial honoring  Michael Brown as a ""pile of trash"" in an interview with The Washington Post, the city has announced. The newspaper quoted Officer Timothy Zoll after the memorial -- flowers, stuffed animals and other items in the street near where Brown was killed in a police shooting -- was destroyed on Christmas. ""I don't know that a crime has occurred,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying Friday. ""But a pile of trash in the middle of the street? The Washington Post is making a call over this?"" St. Louis radio station KMOX later reported that Zoll told its reporter he had been misquoted and actually said that the memorial might have been destroyed by a motorist unfamiliar with the area who had mistaken it for a pile of trash. But in its Saturday night statement, the city said ""the officer admitted to Department investigators that he did in fact make the remarks attributed to him, and that he misled his superiors when asked about the contents of the interview."" It's relatively unusual for government officials to comment on employee disciplinary issues, but anything involving the Michael Brown case is far from routine. Brown died August 9 after being shot by Officer Darren Wilson in a brief encounter that provoked protests across the nation before and after a grand jury declined to bring charges in the case. The shooting sharply divided Americans between those who sided with Wilson and other police officers as heroes patrolling dangerous streets, and those who argued too many officers bring an overbearing posture and quick-to-shoot mindset to largely African-American communities. Nowhere has that tension been greater than Ferguson, where the largely white police force has faced harsh criticism over poor relations with the city's predominantly black population. City officials have pledged to improve that relationship, and took pains to note police Chief Thomas Jackson kept investigating the statement even after Zoll initially denied making it. ""The City of Ferguson wants to emphasize that negative remarks about the Michael Brown memorial do not reflect the feelings of the Ferguson Police Department and are in direct contradiction to the efforts of City officials to relocate the memorial to a more secure location,"" the city said in its statement. In September, the memorial burned in what police said appeared to be an accident caused by burning candles, but which also raised suspicions in the area.

"(CNN) -- My mother, Ms. Nippy Carville, was a woman of many talents. Two in particular stand out. She was a superb cook (the author of a successful cookbook), and she was an excellent bridge player. She always cautioned me that it was important that one ""review the bidding"" before the play. Now that it's becoming apparent that the efforts to cap the well at Deepwater Horizon are going to be successful, we should pause and pay homage to Ms. Nippy's advice by reviewing the bidding. Any fair assessment would have to conclude that in spite of some people's criticism of the early response, (and by ""some people"" I mean Ms. Nippy's firstborn son James), one also must give credit to a much improved and vigorous response to the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf. So, let's review the bidding: First, the decision to keep the unflappable retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen in place as national incident commander, in spite of considerable opposition from some local politicians, has proven to be wise. Second, when Attorney General Eric Holder announced a criminal investigation into the BP disaster, it was a demonstration that the Obama administration meant business in dealing with this catastrophe. Third, the establishment of the $20 billion restitution fund administered by Ken Feinberg was the ultimate statement of the seriousness with which this situation was being addressed by the administration. Fourth, people who have deep knowledge of the events in the Gulf give substantial credit to Energy Secretary Steven Chu and other experts from government labs who were brought in to assist with the successful capping of the well. We in the Gulf region, in particular those of us in Louisiana, have a long way to go. We need our government to remain vigilant in addressing this. We need a lot of research into the science of the effects of the spill. And in the words of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, we need to continue to have the heel of our boot on the neck of BP. All of us in the region need to stay vigilant and aggressive in being sure that the inevitable ""It's time to move on"" mentality does not set in. Trust me. The last thing we need to do is move on until our precious coastline is both restored and renewed. I don't know many people -- and no Democrats -- who were as tough on the Obama administration as I was when the oil started gushing. But for now I'll take Mississippi governor -- and chairman of the Republican Governors' Association -- Haley Barbour saying President Obama has ""done more right than wrong."" In fact, I'll up Gov. Barbour's bid one and say that as of late, President Obama has done a lot more right than wrong. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carville .","James Carville was critical of the federal government's early handling of the oil disaster .

"A fight has broken out between two of the most prominent members of the Republican Party: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. In an op-ed for Breitbart News, Paul took a shot at Cruz, without actually naming him, when he wrote, ""I will remind anyone who thinks we will win elections by trashing previous Republican nominees or holding oneself out as some paragon in the mold of Reagan, that splintering the party is not the route to victory."" This was just one more flash point in the ongoing tension that has characterized their relationship. The back-and-forth has captured considerable attention since both men have been discussed as possible contenders for the Republican nomination in 2016. Each is seen as representing a different faction of the Republican right: Cruz the take-no-prisoners, slash-and-burn conservatives who will do just about anything to obtain their objectives and Paul the libertarian voice pushing back against all forms of government. If Cruz and Paul turn out to be the major spokespersons for the debate about where the Republican Party should go, then the party is going to be in some big trouble. Cruz represents an extremist wing of the GOP that can't seem to govern. Since the emergence of the tea party in 2009, the Republican Party has been shaped by a group of politicians who have been willing to employ extraordinarily aggressive tactics in the pursuit of cuts to domestic spending. Nobody has symbolized this style of leadership more than Cruz. He  led the drumbeat to shut down the federal government to force President Obama's hand on spending and has favored the Republican refusal to raise the debt ceiling. Cruz has also been a master of the filibuster, employing variations of the tactic to bring the Senate to a standstill. This image of obstructionist governance might excite the most loyal activists in the party, but it is not a style conducive to presidential leadership and it is not a style that plays well at a national level. Republicans have suffered greatly in the polls as a result of these kinds of extremist tactics. One recent poll found that four out of five Americans don't trust the Republican Party. ""That's just about as bad as it gets,"" noted MSNBC host, and Republican, Joe Scarborough. Many Americans question whether the Republicans can govern. A Cruz candidacy would perfectly set up a Hillary Clinton candidacy by allowing Democrats to emphasize her ability to get things done and make the political system work. Rand Paul represents a different problem: He is a politician whose rhetoric is totally at odds with the history of the GOP. Since the 1930s, libertarians have had trouble gaining traction within the party. The reality has been that most Republicans have embraced the federal government as a permanent part of national politics. In the area of national security, the party has been a driving force behind the expansion of the military establishment since the Cold War. While some Republicans like Paul might now rail against the surveillance tactics of the National Security Agency, the recent power of this agency was built on the foundation that Republicans built with the war on terrorism under President George W. Bush. Neither have Republicans been a true small government party in domestic policy. Studies have shown how federal spending has grown more dramatically under Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan, than Democrats. Most Republicans have avoided cutting most of the big-ticket programs, such as Social Security or farm assistance, while pushing for an expansion of government in other areas, such as Medicare Prescription Drugs. Republican legislators have been as skillful at pork-barrel politics as anyone from the other side of the aisle. Though Paul may claim he will do things differently, Democrats could have a field day challenging the veracity of such claims given the weight of history that he faces. The weaknesses of both men—Cruz in terms of his style and Paul in terms of his rhetoric—point out how desperate the GOP is to find someone who can build a broad coalition, something that is essential for a presidential victory, particularly when Republicans will likely be facing a formidable candidate. The problems of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have been a huge blow to the party, and there are not many alternatives at this point who are willing to run to replace a figure who, in terms of style of governance and rhetoric, would have a better chance of appealing to voters beyond the base. This is the reason former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is getting so much buzz, as potentially the only other person who can fill this void. If Republicans can't find some alternative and the primaries revolve around  the tension between Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, Democrats will be in excellent position to retain the White House in 2016.","Sen.

"It's the stuff you might expect only to see on TV or in movies -- the upbeat kind with happy endings. Thankfully, that is just what happened in Burbank, California -- the Southern California city that's home to Warner Brothers and Walt Disney studios -- as a toddler fell from three stories up into a stranger's arms and onto a box spring mattress. ""It feels like I watched a TV show, like it didn't happen to me,"" Konrad Lightner, who identified himself as the man who caught the child and fell with him, told CNN affiliate KABC. Sunday was moving day for Lightner and wife Jennifer, a typically exhausting if not momentous endeavor. Until, that is, they spied a youngster hanging out of a third-story window of an apartment building and called 911. According to Burbank fire Capt. Peter Hendrickson, calls for help came shortly after 5:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET), after witnesses saw the child crawling out of the window. Enter the box spring. It was placed under the window, and although Hendrickson did not name the Good Samaritans, the Lightners said it was their mattress and Konrad Lightner's arms that came to the rescue. The toddler fell only to be caught, and together the toddler and the catcher fell onto the box spring. Jennifer Lightner told KABC that the whole episode ""didn't seem real until he was hanging from (a) chord, because there was no way he was going to get back."" It was then, she added, that the couple threw down their box spring mattress. ""It (was) now up to Konrad to catch him,"" Jennifer Lightner added. That's exactly what Konrad Lightner said he did, putting his arms around the falling child ""and lower(ing) him real fast to the box spring."" Photos taken a short time later and posted on MyBurbank.com showed a man -- clad in a T-shirt, shorts and no shoes -- cradling what appeared to be his child on the box spring. Another shows the same man carrying the child, surrounded by toys like Minnie Mouse and SpongeBob SquarePants dolls and as Jennifer Lightner holds the box spring upright. The youngster appeared to be dressed in footsie pajamas, with no signs of trauma or obvious injuries. The child was transported to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, said Hendrickson of the Burbank fire department. Another photo shows a firefighter helping the Lightners carry away their box spring, and one pictures Konrad Lightner being thanked by a firefighter. Jennifer Lightner described the happening as ""very surreal,"" all the more so considering the couple resumed the mundane task of moving not long after. ""I'm not a hero,"" her husband told KABC.

"Italians are bashing an American gun manufacturer's advertising campaign that uses the iconic statue of David holding an AR-50A1 rifle with the tagline, ""A Work of Art."" Italy's minister of culture took to Twitter on Saturday and threatened legal action against the Illinois-based weapon manufacturer Armalite for using the image of Michelangelo's masterpiece to boost sales of a weapon that retails for about $3,300. Dario Franceschini said that he wants ArmaLite to withdraw the image because it ""offends and violates the law."" Cristina Acidini, the superintendent of  the State Museums of Florence, added that the image of David is copyrighted to Italy and can't be used without permission, according to Italy's state run ANSA news agency. CNN could not reach ArmaLite for comment. Still, the controversial ad of David holding the rifle isn't new: It's been out since at least last May, when it was posted to the company's Twitter feed. ArmaLite's current image in the ""A Work of Art"" campaign shows a rifle hanging on a museum wall wedged between two iconic paintings --  the Mona Lisa and  ""American Gothic."" Some Italians took to the U.S. company's Facebook page after finding out about their cultural minister's legal threat. ""Why don't you use your own bloody monuments work of art?"" asked one person. Another wrote: ""Art is untouchable and can't be use to spread death.

But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times tells us the story doesn't end there. Graham, a Southern gentleman after all, apparently felt compelled to call and explain. ""Sen. Graham actually called Rubio World and suggested that he got a little bit over his skis and wasn't trying to diss Sen. Rubio and that he was taken out of context there,"" Martin said. ""So I think this is one of those examples, John, when you say something to a reporter and you see it in print and then you want that one back."" 2. Rand and the GOP brand . Sen. Rand Paul makes no secret of the fact he thinks the GOP needs an image makeover if it wants to be competitive in presidential politics. He is trying to build bridges to the African-American community and spends a lot of time on college campuses. The question is, will his views hurt him among social conservatives who have outsized influence in some early presidential battlegrounds? This past week, Paul said he did not oppose birth control, including the so-called Plan B morning after pill many Christian conservatives consider tantamount to abortion. And in an interview with CNN's Peter Hamby, Paul also opened the door to, like President Obama, evolving away from his opposition to same-sex marriage. ""I mean, people change their minds all the time on this issue, and even within the Republican Party, there are people whose child turns out to be gay, and they're like, 'oh, well, maybe I want to rethink this issue,' "" Paul said. ""So it's been rethought. The President's rethought the issue. So I mean, a lot of people have rethought the issue."" ""You could rethink it at some point, too?"" Hamby asked him. He shrugged and gave a half-grimace. So stay tuned on this potential ""evolution."" 3. Good for book sales but not so good for Obama . Margaret Talev of Bloomberg News shared reporting on White House concerns about the latest insider account from a former Obama loyalist. Leon Panetta, the former defense secretary and CIA chief, writes in a new book that Obama didn't make much of an effort to overcome Iraqi resistance to leaving a residual U.S. military force in the country. ""Those on our side viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests,"" Panetta said in an excerpt from his new book, ""Worthy Fights."" And there is more. Veteran diplomat Chris Hill also has a new book that levels criticism at both Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. We know Vice President Joe Biden doesn't like this trend. ""I'm finding that former administration officials, as soon as they leave, write books, which I think is inappropriate,"" Biden said Thursday. ""At least give the guy a chance to get out of office."" So after a couple of days touting good economic news, Talev notes, the White House will be forced to pivot back to a more controversial topic. ""We'll see President Obama in the coming week really back on the defensive about his foreign policy,"" Talev said. ""This is all happening at a time when President Obama is dealing with this nightmare on the Ebola crisis and does not want his (National Security Council) staff pulled off to the side to deal with this, but it really could be a problem for Obama's legacy, has the potential to hurt midterms and very interesting to see how Hillary handles it so that is not something that dogs her before 2016."" 4. Turnout matters, and Democrats see obstacles in new restrictions . Democrats know their best odds in this difficult midterm election year depend on getting their base voters -- including African-Americans and Latinos -- to turn out in percentages higher than the historical averages. But The Atlantic's Molly Ball says some Democrats are nervous because of voting restrictions that just happen to be in some of the key 2014 battlegrounds. ""They've put so much emphasis on the ground game, they've put so much emphasis on trying to bring in new voters in a midterm year, but in a lot of states, there are new voting restrictions going into effect -- in states like Kansas, which is suddenly in play, and North Carolina, the voter ID got thrown out of court, but they still restricted the voting hours,"" Ball said. ""And so Democrats are starting to worry that in these elections that are going to be so close, it's going to be a real problem for them."" 5. In N.H., some Republicans see hardball unfolding after Boehner snub . Just 10 days ago, House Speaker John Boehner went to New Hampshire and raised some money for GOP congressional candidate Marilinda Garcia, a state senator who is trailing but in a close race against a Democratic incumbent. In a radio interview a few days after the Boehner visit, Garcia refused to commit to voting for the speaker if, as promised, he seeks another term in January. Now, several New Hampshire Republicans say they are hearing the National Republican Congressional Committee, the GOP campaign arm run by Boehner deputies, is letting it be known it won't spend in the 2nd Congressional District in the final month of the campaign. Can we connect those dots? Is it just a tough resource decision? Or a misunderstanding? We'll keep an eye on it. Interesting, because the GOP does have a chance at a few race pickups in New England. POST-SHOW UPDATE: . Camp Garcia reached out after the show Sunday to clear things up -- and to give an unequivocal response to the question the candidate did not directly answer on the radio show. ""Marilinda is focused on running her race and talking about the issues relevant to New Hampshire voters, not inside-the-Beltway politics,"" Garcia campaign manager Tom Szold told CNN. ""But she fully intends to support John Boehner for Speaker if she is elected to Congress in November."" That should put to rest any understanding. Now we'll see if the NRCC helps out in the final month.","Sen. Lindsey Graham calls Sen. Marco Rubio camp to walk back ""not ready"" 2016 remarks .

"Did you cut your cable but miss recording your favorite shows? TiVo might have the answer. The DVR company announced a new, $50 device that lets cord-cutters record over-the-air network shows and watch them later on their televisions. The TiVo Roamio OTA DVR (the OTA stands for ""over the air"") can record and store programs aired by CBS, ABC, NBC, PBS, Fox, Univision and other networks. It also connects to Web services, including YouTube and Netflix. ""We recognize some viewers opt not to receive the benefits a subscription with a cable provider offers,"" TiVo chief marketing officer Ira Bahr said in a news release. ""TiVo Roamio OTA makes sure that they, too, can get a best in class DVR experience through an antenna."" The announcement comes two months after the Supreme Court ruled that Aereo, a similar service, violated copyright laws. Aereo captured shows from the broadcast airwaves and let users stream them digitally to their computers, smartphones or tablets. The difference, TiVo says, is that the OTA uses devices in the home to record video, instead of recording it outside the home then streaming it to digital devices. ""The technology is not anything new,"" TiVo spokesman Steve Wymer told Bloomberg. ""We never had legal challenges regarding recording content in the home for an individual consumer."" TiVo's news release was printed under the title, ""Simple, Brilliant and Legal."" You know you're in peculiar times when an established digital company makes a point of clarifying that its new product is legal. While still dwarfed by the nation's millions of homes with cable, a growing number of consumers have begun ""cutting the cord"" in recent years -- opting to rely exclusively on network broadcasts and streaming Web services like Netflix, Amazon and YouTube for their movie and TV show needs. The OTA can record up to four programs at the same time and has 500 GB of storage, enough for 75 hours of high-definition recordings. It will be available September 14 in a limited release at Best Buy stores, with more availability, presumably, if the product succeeds in those markets. One thing that cable-haters may not love: in addition to its $50 price, the Roamio OTA comes with a $15 monthly fee and a minimum one-year subscription. That's still a lot less than most cable packages, but one more fee to pile on top of those other Web-content subscriptions.","TiVo unveils the Roamio OTA DVR to record network shows .

"In an intensive care unit in Memphis, a virus ravages the body of a 7-year-old who's in heart and kidney failure. He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil. In a cabinet in Durham, North Carolina, there's a drug that could likely help Josh Hardy, but the drug company won't give it to him. They're adamant that spending the time to help Josh and others like him will slow down their efforts to get this drug on the market. Helping Josh, they say, means hurting others. When asked how he will feel if Josh dies -- and he's in critical condition, so sadly that could happen soon -- the president of the company that makes the drug doesn't hesitate to answer. ""Horrible,"" said Kenneth Moch. He would feel horrible and heartbroken. But still, he said there's no way he's going to change his mind. There's no way he's going to give Josh this drug. 'We're begging them' It's called ""compassionate use,"" but sometimes it feels anything but compassionate. Here's the way it works: According to the Food and Drug Administration, if someone has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug, one that they're still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA. Companies often say yes: The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013. In cancer drug battle, both sides appeal to ethics . But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as they did to Josh Hardy. ""Our son will die without this drug,"" said Todd Hardy, Josh's father. ""We're begging them to give it to us."" So now, like many families, the Hardys have turned to the media, Facebook, and change.org to pressure the drug company to change its mind. Countless members of ""Josh's army"" have responded with angry tweets to @chimerix, telling them to ""open their hearts,"" asking the executives how they can sleep at night. ""Everyone is watching,"" one tweeter warned the company.  Others have tweeted out the e-mail addresses of the company's board members. Chimerix executives say they've received physical threats. Moch, the company president, has read these tweets and said he is heartbroken, but the issue is complex and unsuitable for a 144-long character debate. At its very simplest, this is it: Chimerix is going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016, and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases, it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug, brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone. The company would have to dish out $50,000 per compassionate-use patient, since insurance doesn't usually pay for experimental drugs, Moch said. And perhaps even more important than the money, it would divert manpower in this 50-person company, since they'd have to handle the requests and then get the patient's records and follow up with them, as required by the FDA. ""If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question,"" he said. ""But it's yes to all or no to all."" From 2009 to 2012, the company did give out the drug under compassionate use to 451 patients, Moch said, but at least at that time, the information gleaned from those 451 compassionate use patients was helpful to the Chimerix study and helped move the science along. But currently doctors don't really learn very much, if anything, from compassionate use patients, so the patients don't help get the drug to market. Beat cancer four times . Josh's journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it. But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body. They gave him an antiviral drug, an intravenous form of brincidofovir, but it ravaged his kidneys. His doctors at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital said not to give up hope. Since they'd been part of the brincidofovir studies, they'd seen how in sometimes just a week or two, the the oral form of the drug could get rid of an adenovirus without damaging the kidneys. Now all they had to do was ask the company that makes brincidofovir: Chimerix, Inc. On February 12, the St. Jude's doctors called a Chimerix executive, Dr. Marion Morrison, and asked for permission to use brincidofovir. She said no. On March 5, the doctors asked again. Two days later they got an answer by e-mail from another executive, Dr. Herve Mommeja-Marin, who said the company was not ""in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources."" 'He holds our son's life in his hands' Moch wants you to know that he has children of his own, and if his child had an aggressive adenovirus like Josh, he'd be doing the same thing as Todd and Aimee Hardy. ""There are no words to express our compassion for this young boy and his family and what they're going through,"" he said. Art Caplan, a bioethicist at NYU Langone Medical Center, said he feels for both the Hardys and for Moch. ""We can't ask the company to turn into a philanthropy or their investors will back out,"" he said. It's not just the $50,000 per patient that might make investors squeamish, Caplan said, but compassionate cases can make a drug look bad. By definition, compassionate use patients are extremely sick, and might not do well with the drug. Companies have to report that poor outcome to the FDA in its application to market the drug. Perhaps there's another way to handle compassionate use requests, Caplan suggests. Perhaps a company like Chimerix could agree to give the drug only to the very most dire cases, and put a cap on the number of patients they help. ""They might want to open the door a little more broadly,"" he said. ""They might want to show a little compassion."" But right now, Chimerix stands firm that their compassionate use program is almost completely over. ""We've had employees who ask for the drug for family members who are close to death, and the answer has been no,"" said Mommeja-Marin, the Chimerix executive. But that's not good enough for the Hardys. ""He holds our son's life in his hands,"" Todd Hardy said. ""This is just beyond belief to me."" 3-D printer helps save dying baby .","Josh Hardy is in critical condition at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital .

"As season 5 of ""Duck Dynasty"" wraps up, co-star Willie Robertson is not backing down from either his faith or the controversy those beliefs helped stir. His father, Phil Robertson, was suspended from the family's hit A&E reality show in December amid the uproar over remarks he made about race and sexuality in a GQ magazine interview. Willie Robertson and his wife, Korie, spoke to CNN's Kyra Phillips in an interview that aired Wednesday on ""New Day."" ""(Phil) made Christmas very interesting for us,"" the younger Robertson joked. New Day: Before season finale, a behind-the-scenes look at 'Duck Dynasty' Robertson said he believed the GQ interviewer already ""had what he wanted to put, and he was specifically asking this and that."" ""Phil just said what he thought, what was on his heart,"" his son said. ""He did some paraphrasing there."" The ""Duck Dynasty"" patriarch paraphrased a verse from Corinthians and said, ""Don't be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers -- they won't inherit the kingdom of God. Don't deceive yourself. It's not right."" The younger Robertson told CNN, ""I believe what the Bible says."" ""You have to read the Bible and make up your own mind,"" he said. ""You have to decide, and God will ultimately decide then. We don't profess to be God, and we certainly don't profess to be perfect. Because we have our own sins that we deal with."" ""Anybody who knows (Phil) ... any gay, straight, black, white, anybody who knows Phil knows that he is about love and his message is about God's love, God's grace and his forgiveness, ultimately,"" Korie Robertson added. The couple appear in the new film ""God's Not Dead,"" which, according to Entertainment Weekly, was a surprise hit with its recent opening weekend. It earned $8.6 million in only 780 theaters. The Robertson family is halfway through filming season 6 of the show, which has brought in millions beyond the success of its duck call business. But ""Duck Dynasty"" ratings have slipped since the controversy. And if it all ended tomorrow, both the fame and the TV show, the couple says, the family would be just fine.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Grandparents, retirees and struggling seniors have waited months for this. Seniors will receive their stimulus payments the same way they receive their Social Security funds. Tens of millions of Social Security recipients will see their bank accounts jump by $250 starting Thursday, when the government began sending out checks and transferring funds for a one-time boost coming from the stimulus bill passed in February. The payments are flowing to nearly 55 million seniors and retirees between now and June 4, with a huge batch of checks hitting the mail this week. ""Approximately half of them will be out in the next day or two,"" Social Security Commissioner Michael Astrue told CNN Thursday. The money will arrive in the same way that each person receives regular Social Security or Supplemental Security Income funds. If a person receives a Social Security check in the mail, the $250 stimulus payment will also appear in his or her mailbox. An increasing number of people use direct deposit, so many seniors and SSI recipients could see the $250 boost in their accounts immediately. Social Security and SSI recipients make up the largest groups to get the stimulus money, but it will also go out to railroad retirees and disabled veterans. Agencies serving those groups will release the funds separately. All told, the government estimates some 64 million Americans will receive the one-time stimulus checks this year, at a cost of $13 billion to the federal budget. This comes as the Obama administration continues a public relations push to show that the $787 billion stimulus act is warming up the economy. Astrue noted that these $250 payments are going out weeks before the deadline and are, by far, the largest single stimulus payment to individual Americans. ""This is a point in time where some of the first big chunks of stimulus money is actually going into the economy,"" Astrue said. Meanwhile, there is vigorous debate over how stimulus payments will be spent in tough times. Will the checks do anything for the overall economy? Astrue's agency has asked seniors to e-mail and tell what they plan to do with the $250. He admits that some have said they expect to save the money or pay off debts, but he insists that many responses listed hands-on spending. ""We get people who say they'll buy paint, we get people who say they'll buy furniture,"" he said. ""Quite a few of our recipients say they'll buy clothes or school supplies for their grandkids.""","Stimulus payments to be sent to 55 million recipients between now and June 4 .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the Tea Party movement, the stereotypes don't tell the whole story. Here's what you often see in the coverage of Tea Party rallies: offensive posters blasting President Obama and Democratic leaders; racist rhetoric spewed from what seems to be a largely white, male audience; and angry protesters rallying around the Constitution. Case in point: During the health care debate last month, opponents shouted racial slurs at civil rights icon Georgia Rep. John Lewis and one person spit on Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. The incidents made national headlines, and they provided Tea Party opponents with fodder to question the movement. But here's what you don't often see in the coverage of Tea Party rallies: Patriotic signs professing a love for country; mothers and fathers with their children; African-Americans proudly participating; and senior citizens bopping to a hip-hop rapper. Last week, I saw all of this during a five-city Western swing as the Tea Party Express national tour made its way across the country. CNN was along for the ride, and I was charged with planning CNN's coverage for five stops in two states: St. George, Provo and Salt Lake City, Utah; and Grand Junction and Denver, Colorado. This latest Tea Party caravan kicked off on March 27 in Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's hometown of Searchlight, Nevada. It is scheduled to make 45 stops before rolling into Washington on April 15, not so coincidentally on ""Tax Day."" CNN was the only national news outlet on this Western leg of the tour. We had a full team on the ground: myself, correspondent Ed Lavandera, producers Tracy Sabo and Jim Spellman and the crew of the CNN Express bus. For Spellman, it was his third Tea Party Express tour. Together, we beamed out images of the anger and the optimism, profiled African-Americans who are proud to be in the Tea Party's minority and showed activists stirred by ""God Bless America"" or amused by a young rapper who strung together rhymes against the president and Democrats. The CNN Express traveled with the Tea Party Express buses for hundreds of miles, from rally to rally to rally. Being at a Tea Party rally is not quite like seeing it on TV, in newspapers or online. That's the reason CNN is covering this political movement -- and doing so in ways few others can or choose to do. It is important to show the colorful anger Americans might have against elected leaders and Washington. But people should also see the orange-vested Tea Party hospitality handlers who welcome you with colorful smiles. There were a few signs that could be seen as offensive to African-Americans. But by and large, no one I spoke with or I heard from on stage said anything that was approaching racist. Almost everyone I met was welcoming to this African-American television news producer. And though speakers railed against the ""lame-stream media,"" activists and their leaders praised CNN, especially for being the only national media outlet riding along for the post-weekend stops. Some of them e-mailed me after my trip, thanking our crew for fairly giving them a voice. Speaking of stereotypes, I did get a few curious stares as I pulled up to the rallies. But not because of my skin color. It was because of my car rental: a Volvo. I hadn't intended to rent a Volvo, a car stereotyped as the favorite of liberal elites. But upon arriving at the Las Vegas airport, the rental company was out of American-made cars with a GPS system and satellite radio. I had nearly a thousand miles of driving ahead, through desert, mountains and cities. Since it had GPS and satellite radio, the Volvo fit the bill. Outside of the occasional stare, none of the real cowboys at the rallies came up to the Volvo and asked me, ""Hey buddy -- where's your cashmere sweater and arugula?"" If they had, I might have pointed out that until just recently, Volvo was owned by Ford Motor Co., an American icon. Jokes aside, stereotypes can loom large when they're magnified through a television lens, on the radio, the pages of a newspaper or in the vastness of the Internet. So, it's important that with a newsworthy, growing phenomenon like the Tea Party movement, viewers and readers fully understand what they see and what they don't.","CNN's Shannon Travis planned coverage of Tea Party Express for five stops in two weeks .

"A beloved Roman Catholic priest was found dead Wednesday in his church's rectory, spurring police to launch a murder investigation and those he touched to try to make sense of his sudden passing. Eureka, California, Police Chief Andy Mills said officers -- responding to a call from staff at St. Bernard Church -- first came across the victim around 9 a.m. Wednesday. He did not elaborate on how the death occurred, adding Wednesday night that there were no suspects. Mayor Frank Jager identified the victim as the Rev. Eric Freed, whom he called a personal friend and a ""tremendous person in this community"" since his arrival three years ago. The St. Bernard Parish website featured a cross and the words, ""Rest in Peace,"" above Freed's name. ""He was a really, genuinely warm individual,"" said professor Stephen Cunha, the chairman of Humboldt University's religious studies department where Freed taught for more than 10 years. ""... Kind is the word that comes to mind, sensitive."" Noting that students at the state university loved Freed -- who was also deeply involved in that school's Catholic student group, the Newman Center -- Cunha added: ""This was not some stuffy clergyman. He was very much someone that you could sit down and speak with... ""He connected with everybody."" Local and state authorities remained at St. Bernard Church -- one of two in the coastal Northern California city situated 275 miles north of San Francisco where he was the sole pastor -- late Wednesday processing the crime scene and following up on tips, Mills said. Those efforts include looking for Freed's vehicle, a 2010 Nissan Altima. The police chief said that authorities had no solid leads. Just a few days ago, the priest sent a note to his parishioners thanking them for their support and prayers and wishing them a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. ""I cannot tell you how proud and honored I am to be your pastor,"" Freed wrote in a letter posted on the parish website. ""Our parish is alive, joyful and full of faith, hope and charity that define us as Catholic Christians."" While he was relatively new to St. Bernard, Freed had already made an impact there and elsewhere around Eureka -- including with the city's Japanese-American community, as Freed lived in Japan for many years -- Jager told reporters. ""This is an absolutely tremendous loss not only for the St. Bernard's Parish, but for our community generally,"" the mayor said. ""For those of us who believe in prayer, this is the time for that."" His ties to Humbodt State went back even longer. A guest lecturer, Freed wrote a book about the first atomic bomb and also taught about the New Testament, connecting with Christians and non-Christians alike. ""He was very well respected, very well liked and had a tremendous working knowledge as well as academic knowledge,"" Cunha said. ""... To think that he passed in this way: It's just layers of grief and shock.""","Police open murder probe into the death of Rev. Eric Freed .

"Chris Christie and Hillary Clinton are neck-and-neck in the New Jersey governor's home state, according to a poll released Tuesday about the hypothetical presidential match-up. Fairleigh Dickinson University's Public Mind Poll found that Clinton garnered 45% of the New Jersey electorate while Christie won 42%. Clinton's slight lead is within the poll's 3.7% margin of error, making the contest a statistical tie. A tie, however, is down from where Clinton was just last month. A Quinnipiac University Poll found in August that Clinton would beat Christie in New Jersey 50% to 42%. This was the first time that Fairleigh Dickinson asked questions about Clinton vs. Christie in the Garden State. When Christie won re-election in 2013, he was heralded as the Republicans' hope for winning the White House in 2016 because of his crossover appeal with Democratic and independent voters. While the governor has been hampered by the George Washington Bridge scandal -- and seen his polling numbers with Democrats fall -- Fairleigh Dickinson's polling director sees promise in these numbers for Christie. ""These numbers continue to provide a testament to his crossover appeal, even in light of the ongoing investigations that have dogged him for going on a year,"" said Krista Jenkins. ""Numbers like these can help him build support as he crisscrosses the country as head of the Republican Governors Association and enters the world stage."" Correct the Record, an outside research and communications groups helping Clinton, said the fact that Clinton is tied with Christie in his home state bodes well for Democrats in 2016. ""If Christie is the nominee, the Republicans will have to spend money to win their nominee's home state,"" said Burns Strider, senior adviser to the group. ""Folks, Christie should be able to win his home state, and he can't guarantee it by any means."" Both Clinton and Christie are seen as top-level contenders for their respective party's presidential nomination in 2016. Clinton has admitted to thinking about running and recently said she will make her decision near the start of 2015.

"(CNN) -- Your husband, an avid gamer and techie, dies of a heart attack, leaving his vast online life ­-- one you don't know much about ­-- in limbo. Eternal Space lets loved ones create customized online gravesites and memorial pages. His accounts, to which you don't know the passwords, go idle. His e-mails go unanswered, his online multiplayer games go on without him and bidders on his eBay items don't know why they can't get an answer from the seller. Web site domains that he has purchased, some of which are now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars,­ will expire, and you may never know. It's a scenario that's becoming more likely as we spend more of our lives online. And it's raising more questions about what happens to our online lives after we log off for the final time. The answer, until recently, was nothing. But now, as online usage increases and social-media sites soar in popularity, more companies are popping up to try and fill that void created in your digital life after death. Jeremy Toeman, founder of the site Legacy Locker, recognized that when he was on a plane and wondered what would happen to his online life if it crashed. While his will leaves everything to his wife, including all of his digital assets, Toeman realized how difficult it would be for her to access his accounts. ""My GoDaddy account would belong to her, but it doesn't solve the practical reality of how she would get access to it,"" he said. He experienced a similar scenario after his grandmother died, and he tried to get the password for her e-mail account -- only to give up because of the hassle. So Toeman built his company to change all that. Legacy Locker allows users to set up a kind of online will, with beneficiaries that would receive the customer's account information and passwords after they die. ""We know it's a hard thing to think about -- to get people to face mortality. We know it's kind of morbid, but for those who live their entire lives online, it's also very real."" A Legacy Locker account costs $29.99 a year. Users can set up their accounts at www.legacylocker.com to specify who gets access to their posthumous online information, along with ""legacy letters,"" or messages, that can be sent to loved ones. If someone contacts Legacy Locker to report a client's death, the service will send the customer four e-mails in 48 hours. If there's no response, Legacy Locker will then contact the people the client listed as verifiers in the event of his or her death. Even then, the service would not release digital assets without examining a copy of the customer's death certificate, Toeman said. Eddie Lopez is the kind of tech-savvy guy for which a service such as Legacy Locker was made. The St. Paul, Minnesota, man has three online banking accounts, a PayPal account, domain names, Web-hosting accounts, multiple e-mail addresses and many social-networking accounts. ""I do think this is something people should be really considering these days,"" Lopez told CNN when asked about services such as Legacy Locker. He wants to hire a service to handle his digital assets but is concerned about privacy. ""Although I'm glad there's people breaking ground in this area, I don't think I would jump at the first opportunity to sign up,"" Lopez said. ""My concerns are turning over such an exhaustive list of user names and passwords to a single business. That's one-stop shopping for any hacker to get access to just about every detail of my life."" Lopez would prefer to entrust half of his digital-security information to a service such as Legacy Locker and the other half to family members, so that each side's information would be useless without the other's. ""I hope Legacy Locker and similar services can address these privacy-security concerns with some real-world solutions,"" he said. ""I just don't feel comfortable turning over my digital life -- built over 15 years -- to a kind promise."" Legacy Locker isn't the only new company helping techies plan for death in the digital age. AssetLock (formerly YouDeparted.com) offers a ""secure safe deposit box"" for digital copies of documents, wishes, letters and e-mails. Deathswitch and Slightly Morbid also offer similar services in a variety of prices and packages, depending on how many accounts are involved. Not all of these services deal with online assets. There's also a growing trend towards giving all aspects of death --­ the grieving process, the funeral, the memorial and even the grave site --­ a digital makeover. FindaGrave.com claims to have cemetery records for 32 million people in its searchable database, while EternalSpace.com offers a new spin on the traditional grave site by offering virtual memorial pages ­full of videos, pictures and tributes. On Eternal Space, loved ones can choose from different headstones and bucolic landscape backgrounds -- the mountain lake is a popular option -- to create a customized online grave site. Loved ones can add ""tribute gifts"" such as roses, candles, stuffed animals and other items, while mourners can access photos and videos in a ""Memory Book"" and leave remembrances of their own. Jay Goss, president of Eternal Space president, is trying to bring the funeral experience to anyone who can access the Web. In that way, he hopes to provide a gathering place, and a voice, for mourners who may not be able to attend the real-life memorial service. ""It'd be the equivalent of a funeral where everyone can attend and everyone can spend 30 minutes behind the podium,"" Goss said. ""It gives everyone a chance to put a 360-degree wrapper on the life the person lived and celebrate that life from how every person knew them."" Eternal Space's virtual memorial sites are currently only being offered through select funeral homes, cemeteries and crematoriums. Goss' hope is that the site will help allow the deceased's memory to be ""eternally"" passed on. ""All of these stories and videos are being left, in essence, to this Eternal Space Web site so that everyone can share, not just that day, not the days after, but the weeks after and years after,"" he said. Some funeral-industry professionals believe these online memorials and virtual grave sites provide a valuable service. ""Assuming the site is handled with respect, virtual memorials respond to a basic human need to remember our deceased family, friends and colleagues,"" said Robert M. Fells, general counsel for the International Cemetery, Cremation and Funeral Association. ""Based on our members' feedback, I'd have to say that virtual memorial sites are gaining popularity with the public as a very practical alternative to being present at the grave site,"" he added. ""There's nothing 'weird' about them as far as we have seen."" ""There are funeral homes out there that will help families create virtual memorials, but ... we've also seen Facebook and MySpace profiles of deceased persons being turned into memorials,"" agreed Jessica Koth, spokesperson for the National Funeral Directors Association. ""Consumers have become increasingly comfortable with expressing their grief online."" ""While not a replacement for a funeral, online memorialization can help people work through their grief after the funeral,"" she added. ""We've all become accustomed to communicating and expressing ourselves electronically -- via e-mail, Facebook, Twitter. Expressing one's grief online is an outgrowth of what's happening in other areas of our lives.""

"A shadowy figure in a wave near children swimming at a southern California beach has experts disagreeing. Discovery Channel shark expert Jeff Kurr calls it a great white shark, but shark expert David Shiffman believes it was a dolphin. The beast was caught on camera lurking near June Emerson's 12-year-old son and three young friends as they played in the Manhattan Beach surf Friday afternoon. The difference in the experts' opinions centers on how they view the tail. ""This is not a #shark photobombing kids. This is a dolphin,"" Shiffman tweeted Monday. Shiffman, a recognized shark expert, noted in a Facebook posting that ""the tail is flat,"" like a dolphin, and unlike a shark. But in an interview with CNN, Kurr concluded it was ""a juvenile great white shark about 10 to 12 feet long."" ""I would say based on the shape of the dorsal fin, which is more straight, that shows me it's a great white shark,"" Kurr said. ""Plus, the fact that that particular beach has become the epicenter for white shark activity, I would say it's definitely a white shark."" Emerson told CNN that it wasn't until on the way home from the beach that her son spotted the creature in one of the photos she took that afternoon. She remembers seeing dolphins in the water, but no sharks. Emerson told her son that it was a dolphin so as not to scare him away from the beach where they often swim. There are plenty of great white sharks in the southern California surf, but they pose no danger to beachgoers, according to Randy Hamilton, a shark expert with California's Monterey Bay Aquarium. ""I just go back to the last 50 years on how many great white sharks have actually caused a death in southern California,"" Hamilton said. ""I only know of one incident where someone got a nip on the foot."" The great whites around southern California are juveniles, also known as ""young of the year."" At less than 18 months old, they only eat fish, Hamilton said. When the sharks approach adulthood, they relocate to the cooler waters near San Francisco where they change their diets to mammals -- sea lions and seals, he said.","It's ""a juvenile great white shark about 10 to 12 feet long,"" expert Jeff Kurr says .

"New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed legislation Tuesday raising the tobacco-purchasing age from 18 to 21. The law takes effect in six months. In addition to the ""Tobacco 21"" bill, which also covers electronic cigarettes, Bloomberg signed a second bill, dubbed Sensible Tobacco Enforcement, which prohibits discounts on tobacco products and increases enforcement on vendors who attempt to evade taxes. New York State's Department of Health estimates that cigarette excise tax evasion deprived the state of $500 million in 2009. ""By increasing the smoking age to 21, we will help prevent another generation from the ill health and shorter life expectancy that comes with smoking,"" Bloomberg said in a written statement when the legislation was approved by the city council in October. New York City becomes the largest city to have an age limit as high as 21. Needham, Massachusetts, raised the sale age to 21 in 2005, according to the New York City Department of Health. Neighboring states and counties have raised the tobacco sale age to 19, including New Jersey in 2005, the Department of Health said. Raising the sale age ""will protect teens and may prevent many people from ever starting to smoke,"" Health Commissioner Thomas A. Farley said in a statement released after the vote. Doctors support raising the smoking age . This is the latest step in the outgoing mayor's mission for healthier New York City lifestyles. In September 2012, the Board of Health voted to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues, a measure Bloomberg spearheaded. The ban was later tossed out by a New York State Supreme Court judge.

"A Chinese ship trying to reach a trapped expedition vessel in Antarctica has turned back. The icebreaker Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, was just six nautical miles away from the Russian-flagged vessel when the captain decided the ship could not get any closer, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said Saturday. The Snow Dragon went back to open water and remains in the vicinity of the stuck ship, the Akademik Shokalskiy, to provide support, said Andrea Hayward-Maher, spokeswoman for the AMSA. The Chinese vessel has a helicopter on board that could assist in evacuation. A French icebreaker was en route to assist, but AMSA called off that vessel's mission at midday Saturday. The rescue icebreakers were battling the planet's coldest environment in trying to reach the stranded Russian-flagged ship, whose 74 researchers, crew and tourists remained in good condition despite being at a frozen standstill since Monday. AMSA said another icebreaker, the Aurora Australis, was en route and was expected to arrive late Sunday. ""Really, it's just a matter of the Aurora Australis getting down there and assessing the situation to see if it has any capability of breaking through the ice further than the Chinese vessel could and, if not, the aerial transfer of passengers on board may be a possibility,"" Hayward-Maher said. Hayward-Maher said the Australian ship has icebreaking equipment the Chinese and French vessels don't have. ""The Chinese vessel and the French vessel are rated to a depth of one meter, which means they are capable of breaking through ice somewhere in the vicinity of a meter,"" she said. ""The Aurora Australis has an ice rating of 1.35 meters. ""Some reports say that the ice is at least 2 meters deep. It's a possibility that the Aurora Australis might not be able to break through that type of ice, anyways."" The expedition ship is carrying scientists and passengers led by an Australian climate change professor. Spirits were high Saturday aboard the Akademik Shokalskiy. ""The vessel is fine, it's safe and everyone on board is very well,"" expedition leader Chris Turney, a professor of climate change at University of New South Wales in Australia told CNN. ""Morale is really high."" The ship got stuck in the ice on Monday night -- 15 days after setting out on the second leg of its research trip. According to Turney, the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet (3 meters) thick. It was about 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Urville, about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. On Christmas morning, the ship sent a satellite distress signal after conditions failed to clear. The crew had a ""great Christmas"" despite their situation, Turney told CNN. He said crew members have used the delay to get more work done. ""We've just kept the team busy,"" he said. The expedition is trying to update scientific measurements taken by an Australian expedition led by Douglas Mawson that set out in 1911. The expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began November 27. The second, and current leg of the trip, started December 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to New Zealand on January 4. Turney said the ship should still be back in New Zealand on time.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger III was ""the right guy at the right time at the right moment"" to guide a jet safely onto the surface of the Hudson River, a neighbor and friend said. Chesley Sullenberger is an Air Force veteran who has been with US Airways since 1980. Sullenberger has a cool, calm and collected style -- honed by decades of flight experience and research on safety issues, friend and neighbor John Walberg told the Contra Costa Times newspaper. All 155 passengers and crew aboard Flight 1549 survived. The 57-year-old former Air Force fighter pilot has been flying for more than 40 years, and has been with US Airways since 1980. His two-page resume is packed with achievements and highlights his broad aviation experience. The pilot speaks internationally on airline safety, and collaborates with the Center for Catastrophic Risk Management at the University of California-Berkeley, whose researchers look for ways to avoid air disasters.  Watch a pilot applaud Sullenberger's skills » . Passenger Joe Hart praised the plane's crew as ""phenomenal, in all respects."" ""Once the pilot said 'brace for impact,' the flight attendants made sure everybody knew they had to be buckled in and bent over,"" Hart said. ""Then they sat in their chairs, strapped themselves in, and in a regular cadence, until we hit the water, they just continued to chant 'brace, brace, brace' so that nobody would sit up. And that, I think, helped prevent a lot of injuries on impact."" CNN affiliate WKOW in Madison, Wisconsin, identified the co-pilot as Jeffrey Skiles, 49. Barbara Skiles told WKOW that, in conversations since the incident, her husband has praised the rescue effort. ""He was really grateful and really impressed about the response that they got, how quickly boats were at the side of the airplane,"" she said. Sullenberger was primed to help passengers aboard the Airbus A320 survive the crisis, said Karlene Roberts, a university  professor who co-directs the center. ""I can imagine him being sufficiently in charge to get those people out,"" she said. ""He's got that kind of personality, which is to his credit.""  Watch how passengers call pilot a hero » . Sullenberger's resume is packed with achievements. After graduating from the Air Force Academy in 1973, he had a brief but distinguished Air Force career during which he flew the Vietnam-era F-4 Phantom fighter jet. He was a flight leader and training officer with experience in Europe and the Pacific and at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, where he was the mission commander for Red Flag exercises. The exercises are for advanced aerial combat training, a position delegated to top pilots. Among those who congratulated Sullenberger was Lt. Gen. John Regni, the Air Force Academy superintendent, who graduated with Sullenberger. ""He not only showcased unbelievable airmanship, but exemplary character as well,"" Regni said. ""In addition to superb judgment under utmost pressure, by checking his aircraft twice to ensure there were no passengers left behind he epitomized the 'service before self' concept we strive to instill in our cadets,"" Regni said. Sullenberger is president and CEO of Safety Reliability Methods Inc., a company he founded. The firm provides emergency management, safety strategies and performance monitoring to the aviation industry. He was an instructor and Air Line Pilots Association safety chairman, accident investigator and national technical committee member, according to a biography on the Web site of his company. He participated in several U.S. Air Force and National Transportation Safety Board accident investigations, and worked with NASA scientists on a paper on error and aviation, according to his resume. He was widely praised after Thursday's forced water landing, apparently caused by a ""double bird strike,"" which crippled the plane's engines. ""It was an amazing piece of airmanship,"" said Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board. Even New York's mayor had praise. ""It would appear that the pilot did a masterful job of landing the plane in the river and then making sure that everybody got out,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference Thursday. ""I had a long conversation with the pilot. He walked the plane twice after everybody else was off and tried to verify that there was nobody else on board -- and assures us there was not."" Sullenberger's wife, Lorrie, told CNN that his response wasn't surprising. ""This is the Sully I know, she said. ""I always knew this is how he would react. So, to me, this is not something unusual. It's the man I know to be the consummate professional."" She also told the New York Post on Thursday that her husband ""is about performing that airplane to the exact precision to which it is made.""

"Ice fishers in Minnesota are reeling from a recent FAA decision prohibiting beer delivery by drone. Local brewery Lakemaid was testing a new drone delivery system to airlift frosty cases of beer to fishermen holed up in ice shacks on Mille Lacs Lake. After spotting a Lakemaid YouTube video that went up last week of one of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on a test run, the Federal Aviation Administration contacted Lakemaid and told the company to stop. Unfortunately for Lakemaid fans and anyone else dreading a walk to the corner store, it's currently against the law to fly drones for commercial purposes or above 400 feet in the United States. The FAA is working on a comprehensive set of rules and regulations that will pave the way for commercial drone flight, but the legislation won't be ready until at least 2015 and drones might not be in the skies until 2017. Until then, thirsty fishermen must obtain their beverages through old-fashioned terrestrial delivery methods. The great beer grounding of 2014 might just be the issue that will turn Americans into pro-drone advocates. A WhiteHouse.gov petition has already gone up, asking the Obama administration to issue Lakemaid an airworthiness certificate. So far, 183 thirsty UAV advocates have signed the petition (only 99,817 signatures to go!). Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has previously expressed his support of aerial beer delivery on Twitter. In August he said ""Perhaps I am not against ALL drones!"" and linked to a news story about a drone delivering beers during a music festival in South Africa. Only amateurs are allowed to fly drones at this time, and they're limited to small vehicles under 55 pounds. They can only operate the aircraft for fun, not for profit, and they must adhere to local and federal laws. For example, drones are not allowed to cruise over populated areas. Some groups have received exceptions to test drones for research purposes. ""While we are evaluating many potential uses of [UAVs] as we move toward their safe integration into the nation's airspace, commercial operation of such aircraft is not yet allowed,"" said FAA spokesperson Elizabeth Cory in an e-mail. Announcing plans to deliver goods by drone has been a popular publicity stunt for U.S. companies over the past year. On a recent ""60 Minutes"" segment, Amazon demonstrated a drone delivery system it's working on for packages. The company conducted the tests outside the country to avoid breaking U.S. law. In June, the Domino's pizza chain said it was developing a drone capable of delivering up to two pizzas. The FAA has asked other companies and institutions to ground their drones in the past year. The agency has contacted a company in Wisconsin that used drones to capture aerial footage for real estate. And the Drone Journalism Lab at the University of Nebraska received a cease-and-desist letter for its attempts to use drones for reporting purposes. Even once FAA regulations are in place, we likely won't see the skies filling up with beer deliveries. Interested companies will have to get proper training and licenses. ""We are concerned about possible careless and reckless operation, especially if someone on the ground is hurt by an object or objects falling from the [UAVs],"" said Cory, citing the FAA regulation that prohibits careless flying. Delivery of goods is expected to be a small segment of future drone market. The bigger commercial uses will focus on agriculture, law enforcement and aerial photography. Delicious test cases like beer and fast-food delivery might be gimmicky, but they can help ease the public's concerns about drones in the sky. The technology is mostly known for its military applications, and civil liberties groups are concerned about drones being used for surveillance by law enforcement. Local residents in Deer Trail, Colorado, have even attempted to pass a law that makes it legal to shoot down drones with the proper drone hunting license. But the next generation of friendly drones aren't all packing weapons or collecting data for the NSA. Some just want to bring you a nice cold one and maybe a slice without getting stuck in traffic.","Wisconsin beer company Lakemaid was testing beer delivery by drone for local ice fishermen .

"Flea and the rest of Red Hot Chili Peppers will jump on to the stage, compliments of fellow performer Bruno Mars, at next month's Super Bowl halftime show. The news was announced Saturday during Fox's coverage of an NFC divisional playoff game. Mars, a Grammy-winning pop singer, invited the Chili Peppers to join him for the Super Bowl XLVIII festivities on February 2 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. ""One of the most successful acts in rock history, Red Hot Chili Peppers, which is singer Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, drummer, Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, have sold more than 60 million albums, including five multi-platinum LPs, and won six Grammy Awards,"" the NFL said in a press release. Their hit songs include ""Give It Away,"" ""Scar Tissue,"" ""Californication"" and ""Suck My Kiss."" Kiedis and Flea, born Michael Balzary, are more than 20 years older than Mars. Their band has pioneered a bold style of rock infused with funk and rap. His 50th birthday bash in October 2012 gave Flea time to take stock of his life, he told CNN. ""I'm definitely wiser, and less likely to make gigantic blunders of an intellectual, spiritual, emotional or physical type,"" he said. ""... But more than anything the passion for the things that I really care about like playing music, and being kind, and children, and the things I love -- sports, books, art -- my passion for all these things has deepened.""

"White House spokesman Jay Carney denied Friday that next year's midterm elections are the reason behind the administration's decision to postpone the 2014 opening date for 2015 enrollment in Obamacare -- from October 15 to November 15. Pushing back the start date, Carney said, will give insurers more time to get an idea of their new pool of customers before they set their 2015 rates. Some critics, including Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said that the move was simply a political ploy and that any changes to health care plans, such as premium increases, for example, should be public before the election. But Carney said the administration expects more people to sign up for health care insurance at the end of the current, initial open enrollment period -- which ends March 31, 2014 -- in part because of the website problems, so starting the next enrollment window later in the year would buy insurers more time to assess the situation. ""What was already going to be a back-loaded process is going to be more back-loaded, and that's going to leave insurers a lot of data to sort through in a short period of time,"" he said. The Department of Health and Human Services has also extended the sign-up period from roughly seven weeks to eight. The new deadline is January 15, 2015, Carney said. The two-month window is a lot shorter than the current six-month window for 2014 coverage, he said. Asked why the administration won't change the more pressing March 31, 2014, deadline, as even some Senate Democrats have asked, Carney said the administration still believes the remaining four months is enough time to get people signed up for insurance. Young adults are less likely than their older counterparts to take out a health insurance policy, but even without that issue, enrollment in Obamacare has been minute overall, particularly via the federal sign-up website HealthCare.gov. Exact numbers are hard to pin down in the 36 states using the site. But as of November 2, just 26,794 people had enrolled in the HealthCare.gov states. CNN's current tally for this group stands at less than 45,000 enrollees, but that's based on just a handful of states that have provided updates. In the 14 states running their own sign-up methods, the numbers look better but still dismal. At least 133,000 people had enrolled at last count. Many more have taken advantage of the expansion of Medicaid. Sticker shock . The Department of Health and Human Services hopes that the added time will encourage insurers to get coverage details right and make their plans more affordable, while consumers have more time to flush the devil out of the details. Some consumers were not only hit with high premiums during the rollout but also with deductibles above flood stage. People picking the bronze plan, which has the lowest premiums, will shell out about $5,000 before insurers foot the bills. Even then, policyholders will cover plenty out of pocket, like doctor visits, lab tests and medications. ""All we ever heard about Obamacare is that it would lower our deductibles and premiums,"" said Jennifer Slafter, 40 of Mabel, Minnesota. ""That's just not what's happened."" Slafter and her husband, Steve, are scrambling to find affordable care for themselves and their two children. The exchange's BlueCross BlueShield plan was $1,087 a month with a $6,000 deductible, while a Medica plan was $877 a month with a $12,700 deductible. Both are steeper than their current plan. Battle ahead . As a side effect, the enrollment delay could also give everyone more time to contend with the political battle over Obamacare and whatever changes to the Affordable Care Act that might result. Republicans on Capitol Hill have distributed a digital playbook among their ranks to align talking points against Obamacare.  The strategy memo is titled ""Because of Obamacare ... I lost my insurance"" and includes videos, fliers and social media posts.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama's inaugural address is one of the most anticipated speeches in decades, with many expecting his words to be chiseled into marble some day. Many expect Barack Obama's inauguration speech to compare to those given by Roosevelt and Kennedy. Obama aides said that the speech will last 18 to 20 minutes and that Obama will emphasize that America is entering a new area of responsibility. He will say that America has been hurt by a ""me first"" mentality that has contributed to the current economic crisis, aides say, and call on individuals -- as well as corporations and businesses -- to take responsibility for their actions. Obama has said he has been studying previous inaugural addresses -- including President Abraham Lincoln's and the speeches President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave as he took office amid the Great Depression. Given the nation's current economic crisis, Errol Lewis, a columnist for the New York Daily News, was looking for Obama to echo Roosevelt's famous 1933 inauguration address when he said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" ""He's got to calm the nation. I think he's got to reassure the nation and let people know that we are in it for the long haul. If you look at that 1933 speech, that is pretty much what FDR did,"" Lewis said.  Watch a preview of inauguration events » . ""He wants to lift us up ... and all the aspirations we have, all the hope,"" Lewis said. ""But at the same time, he has some very practical problems that start at 12:01 p.m., and he starts to own them at high noon. There are no easy answers."" Obama must also emphasize that his administration represents a fresh start for America and ""kick away from that old history,"" said Peggy Noonan, President Ronald Reagan's speechwriter and a columnist for The Wall Street Journal. ""It's been about a year since people thought they had a president, if you will. ... It's been some time since the American people heard, 'We've got an economic problem, but, baby, we are getting through it. We are going to get past this thing. We are going to rise again,' "" Noonan said.   Watch Noonan and others on the art of speech writing » . Obama has already demonstrated his ability as a master orator, and many observers are looking for the new president's address to equal the great speeches by presidents Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Reagan. ""He's got to give that great, soaring speech."" CNN contributor David Gergen said. ""I think the pressure is really on because of the historic nature of this presidency and also because of the extraordinary moment in which we find ourselves with this terrible recession.""  Watch what is expected from Obama's speech » . ""That is a lot to do in a single speech but, you know, because he has such a high reputation for giving excellent speeches ... the expectations for this one are just -- well, they're soaring,"" Gergen added. But beyond the nation's immediate economic concerns, Obama's inauguration speech with also mark a national milestone: the inauguration of the first African-American president. In his previous speeches, Obama has referred to another great African-American orator: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who made a historic speech on the other end of the Mall. Obama is likely to refer to King and the dramatic struggles African-Americans have fought as they emerged from slavery and fought for full civil rights.  Watch what Obama's presidency means to African-Americans » . ""If you think about the journey that this country has made, then it can't help but stir your heart,"" Obama told CNN's John King during an interview Friday. ""The notion that I now will be standing there and sworn in as the 44th president, I think, is something that, hopefully, our children take for granted, but our grandparents, I think, are still stunned by, and it's a remarkable moment."" The pressure on Obama to produce a speech for the ages not is limited to the public, Obama said. After a family visit to the Lincoln Memorial, which has Lincoln's second inaugural address inscribed on its walls, Obama's 10-year-old daughter, Malia, turned her father and said, ""First African-American president -- better be good.""

Bypass on way soon, feds say . For the past month, CNN has conducted a state-by-state survey to determine enrollment in the new insurance plans. As of Tuesday afternoon, at least 133,257 people had chosen new insurance plans in the 14 states with their own signup apparatuses. Nearly half of them were enrolled in the past two weeks. One of the biggest jumps is in California. Through November 2, 35,364 Californians had selected private plans through the new insurance marketplace. Less than two weeks later, the number was up to 59,000. The state with the second-highest enrollment is New York, where at least 24,509 have selected a plan. The next highest enrollments are in Washington state, Kentucky and Connecticut. Bad news for woman cited as Obamacare success story . Enrollment is harder to pin down in the 36 states using HealthCare.gov, although it's running well behind the states with their own programs. As of November 2, just 26,794 people had enrolled in the HealthCare.gov states. CNN's current tally for this group is 43,743 enrollees, but that's based on just a handful of states that have provided updates. In addition, 58,857 newly eligible people have enrolled in state Medicaid programs, with another 275,131 people signed up to start Medicaid coverage on January 1, 2014. Young, healthy needed . Aside from raw enrollment numbers, the data are being scrutinized for any hints about the makeup of the newly insured. In its projections, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 7 million people would enroll in private insurance plans through the marketplaces in 2014, and that 2.7 million -- about 38% of the total -- would be between the ages of 18 and 34. ""There's general agreement that we need younger and healthier people to offset the costs of sicker people coming into the system,"" says Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group. ""That's what will add more stability."" If the concentration of older and sicker enrollees in the new plans is too high, insurers could be forced to raise their rates, which would further discourage young and healthy people from signing up. Taken to an extreme, this vicious cycle could -- in theory -- lead to what Obamacare critics call a ""death spiral"" and the collapse of the law. Industry spokesman: Too early to draw conclusions . So, how's it going? It's a limited picture. HHS hasn't released demographic data for people signing up through HealthCare.gov, and only three states provided their own data to CNN. In those states, the number of under-35 enrollees is less than CBO projected: in Kentucky, 19% of enrollees are age 18-34. In Connecticut and Washington state, the figures are 22% and 23%, respectively. But Zirkelbach says it's way too early to draw conclusions. ""There's lots of evidence to suggest that people needing serious medical care are most likely to purchase insurance initially. Those who don't have urgent medical needs are more likely to purchase insurance later."" Missing from Obamacare: Working & middle class . What's more, age is only a piece of the puzzle. Since those applying for insurance no longer disclose anything about their health, Zirkelbach says insurers won't have a good sense of their medical needs -- and what it will cost to cover them -- until well into 2014. Obamacare architect: No risk of a 'death spiral' The law's supporters say the dire scenarios are farfetched. ""There is essentially no risk of a 'death spiral,'"" says MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, who helped design the ACA as well as the Massachusetts law on which it was modeled. ""There are substantial risk mitigation mechanisms as well as subsidies that will attract in healthy enrollees."" Most important, say Gruber and Zirkelbach, is a section of the ACA under which the federal government will pick up a substantial portion of the losses for the next three years, if the program goes sour for insurers. There's no precedent for a program of this size and scale, and Gruber warns that that the early data are ripe for overinterpretation. While fewer young and healthy customers would mean higher premiums, ""it's hard to say how big a difference 28% vs. 38% makes -- we just don't know."" The trends are likely to come into sharper focus in the next several weeks. Most experts expect the pace of enrollment to accelerate, as the HealthCare.gov website starts to function better and potential customers have more of a chance to explore their options. So far, by CNN's count nearly 900,000 people have completed applications for new insurance but have not yet selected a plan. Poll suggests Obamacare could have cost Obama second term . S.E.

"The nuns in a Carmelite community in Lucena, Spain, received a voice-mail message on New Year's Eve that they had to share with the world. The caller was Pope Francis. ""What are the nuns doing that they can't answer?"" the Pope said jokingly. ""I am Pope Francis, I wish to greet you in this end of the year, I will see if I can call you later. May God bless you!"" The nuns passed the audio message to the Spanish radio network COPE, which is linked to the body that runs the Roman Catholic Church in Spain. The nuns were praying when Francis called shortly before noon, and so didn't answer, the radio network said. When they played the voice mail back, they got a surprise. The prioress of the convent, Sister Adriana, told the radio network she ""literally wanted to die"" when she first heard the message. ""Our friendship goes back 15 years but we never thought the pope would remember to think of us,"" she said. After the nuns realized that they had missed a phone call from the Pope, they didn't know what to do. They consulted with their local bishop and tried to call Francis back, without success, the radio network said. The nuns decided simply to wait in hope of another call. Hours later, the phone rang again -- and this time they answered. Poll: Pope's approval rating sky high . Francis talked with the community's five nuns, three of whom hail from his native Argentina, on speakerphone, COPE said. ""The message from Pope Francis was to never lose hope, because sadness leads to spiritual sloth and hopelessness,"" said Sister Adriana. She added she had known Pope Francis for years and admires his simplicity and closeness to people. The pontiff's call came on the 400th anniversary of the community. Pope celebrates birthday with homeless . The popularity of Francis, the first pope from Latin America, is sky-high, a CNN/ORC International poll released last month showed.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday the launch of a statewide program to fund college courses in prisons, giving inmates the opportunity to earn a college degree. The program, which will begin in the fall, will offer college-level courses at 10 New York prisons -- one for each region of the state. New York has 58 state prisons, according to Matt Wing, spokesperson for Cuomo. During a news conference Sunday, Cuomo said this program is an investment in people before problems develop, rather than just paying for the damage after it occurs. It costs $60,000 a year to incarcerate one person and about $3.6 billion in total costs for prisons, with a 40% chance of an inmate becoming a repeat offender, Wing told CNN. ""Albert Einstein had that famous definition of insanity, which is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. But for years, my friends, we have been doing the same thing over and over, and we have little to show for it. It's time we try something new,"" Cuomo said at the news conference. Cuomo's program is based on a privately funded model started at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, which provided college courses in six maximum and medium security prisons across the state. Some 500 inmates were educated and 250 received degrees, and of those only 4% became repeat offenders. It cost $5,000 a year to fund one college education through the Bard program, according to Cuomo. ""The proof is in the pudding,"" said the governor. But offering a funded college education to incarcerated individuals isn't exactly ""new."" Pell grants, which provide financial aid to students in need, were made available to prison inmates in the 1970s. But in 1994, Congress passed legislation that eliminated Pell grant eligibility for inmates, and the following year, New York  banned inmates from receiving state aid for in-prison education programs. ""New York state held onto a couple of small programs. But they were skeletons of what they used to be,"" said former inmate Glenn Martin. Martin, 42, grew up impoverished in Brooklyn and spent six years in state prison. While serving jail time in Attica and Wyoming correctional facilities, a correction council suggested he apply to college. ""I've never experienced that. No one in my life had ever told me to go to college,"" Martin told CNN. After two years, Martin earned a bachelor's degree in social science from behind bars, with financial aid from a private philanthropy. Now, Martin is the founder and president of JustLeadershipUSA, an organization aimed at reducing the national prison population in half by 2030. Martin is also the co-founder of the Education Inside Out Coalition, which seeks to return educational opportunities to incarcerated and post-incarcerated individuals. Martin said his exposure to a liberal arts education showed him how to navigate a world that he had never known how to manage growing up. Martin said a statewide initiative to fund correctional education is a ""win-win"" for everyone in New York and hopes other states will catch on. ""You save money and you save lives,"" he told CNN. ""You build the communities that are most impacted by crime and incarceration.""","New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants to give inmates the chance to earn a degree .

"Eerie, haunted, sad. Those words are being used in connection with what some workers at the 9/11 Memorial Museum in Lower Manhattan have called the ""Angel of 9-11"" -- an image some see in wreckage salvaged from the World Trade Center's North Tower. Exposure to the elements over more than a decade sculpted what many viewers say is a human visage. The contorted beams were originally part of the first tower that was hit during the terrorist attacks early September 11, 2001. They have since been moved to the nearby National September 11 Memorial and Museum. Though the museum does not open to the public until spring 2014, pictures of the 30-foot structure have elicited what some, in tweets, called ""stunned"" reactions. Some posted that it touched their hearts and that they believe it to be sacred. Others consider it a common type of optical illusion. But their skepticism was tempered with thoughtfulness. Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptical Inquirer Magazine and author of the book ""The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies,"" is among the skeptics. He cited a phenomenon called ""patternicity"" -- the human tendency to find meaningful patterns in meaningless noise. And he credited the brain's software for allowing to see a face on the metal. Anything that looks like it has two eyes and a mouth ""stimulates the area that recognizes faces,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview, citing such common examples as the man in the moon or a face in a cloud. A spokesman for the museum said he is aware of the symbolism of what some have detected. ""People often find meaning in tragedy, particularly in one as widely felt as the September 11 attacks,"" said Anthony Guido, communications manager for the museum, in a written statement. ""This impact steel is historically important to include in the museum as it will help tell the story of 9/11 to visitors from around the world."" And the reactions of some of the workers add to that story.","Some people see an image in a piece of 9-11 wreckage at a yet-to-open museum .

"If you have some disposable income and want to own a piece of aviation or space-exploration history, now's your chance. A metal fragment from the doomed Hindenburg airship, a signed photo of vanished pilot Amelia Earhart and items brought to the moon on the Apollo lunar missions are among hundreds of aviation- and space-related artifacts going on the auction block. Almost 600 items are being offered in RR Auction's Space & Aviation online sale, which begins Thursday and runs through May 22. For space enthusiasts, the highlights may be artifacts from NASA's Apollo lunar missions, including several pieces of rare equipment: . -- A complete Apollo 15 Rotational Hand Controller used by Commander David Scott to fly and land his lunar module on the surface of the moon in 1971. Bidding starts at $10,000. -- A Crewman Optical Alignment Sight used by Scott for rendezvous, docking and star sightings during the lunar module phases of the mission. Bidding starts at $2,500. Both pieces came from Scott's personal collection and are likely to be prized by collectors. ""These items represent the pinnacle of Apollo-era flown material,"" said Richard Jurek, co-author of ""Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program."" ""While risking their lives during the most critical and historic phases of their mission, these are the items that the astronauts personally selected to retain as mementos from arguably the greatest technological and engineering achievement of the 20th century."" Seventy items from Apollo 11 -- the first manned mission to land on the moon -- will be offered, including pieces from the personal collections of Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. Items from other Apollo missions as well as Mercury, Gemini, and space shuttle missions also are being auctioned. Other artifacts include signed maps, patches, photos, and even a full spacesuit. RR Auction has been around for more than 30 years and specializes in rare documents, manuscripts, autographs and historical artifacts. This will be the site's seventh auction that has focused on human aviation and space exploration. Much of the equipment used on NASA missions has been left behind on the moon or sent drifting into the vastness of space. And many items that return from space missions are stored away in private collections or donated to museums, which is why rare auctions of spaceflight memorabilia draw interest from aviation enthusiasts. ""Objects coming directly from moon walkers and that have been in private collections since returning to Earth are unquestionably the most sought after,"" said Bobby Livingston, executive vice present of RR Auction.","Hundreds of rare aviation- and space-related artifacts are going on the auction block .

"Signing up for Obamacare has become a part-time job for Susan Lane. Starting the minute healthcare.gov went live October 1, Lane spent five to six hours a day trying to make the site work before she finally managed to enroll two weeks later. She faced error messages and blank screens. The green twirly ""please wait"" circle literally haunted her dreams. ""There were days that I would just completely lose my temper with it,"" she remembers. ""I'd want to just slam my laptop down."" But Lane kept with it because she needs insurance -- badly. She suffers from depression, sleep apnea and thyroid problems, and her daughter has Asperger's syndrome. She was ""immediately relieved"" when she signed up on healthcare.gov because before Obamacare, no insurance companies would take them with their pre-existing conditions. Their medical bills totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars and ate up the family's life savings, and the Lanes declared bankruptcy earlier this year. Healthcare.gov homepage gets makeover . ""I wanted the coverage, and I was bound and determined to get it,"" Lane said from her Florida home. But will everyone else -- especially healthy people -- be determined enough to stick with healthcare.gov? Will they spend five hours a day trying to make a website work when they aren't motivated by mounting medical bills? Obama administration officials have said they need about 2.7 million young, healthy people to sign up -- and that they fully expect them to join at the very last minute. Without those healthy people, Obamacare could be in trouble, since an insurance pool only works well when healthy people, who pay premiums but use few services, are in it to help offset the costs of people like Lane and her daughter. ""It's incredibly important to have young people in the (insurance) exchanges in the long term,"" said Caroline Pearson, a vice president at Avalere Health, a healthcare strategy group. ""And the glitches on the website don't help the situation at all."" Eventually -- hopefully -- healthcare.gov will become a workable site. But some worry that even then, the website will have been branded as problematic and time-consuming, and some healthy people will prefer to pay the fine for being uninsured, which in many cases is significantly lower than the cost of buying insurance. Official: Obamacare website 'fixable' by end of November . ""Is that perception of this flawed website going to stick with the public, or is it something that can be gotten over?"" asked Michael Perry, a partner at PerryUndem, which does surveying and marketing to young people about health care.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A Web site that encourages girls as young as seven to give virtual dolls breast implants and put them on crash diets has caused concern among parents and children's activists. The provocatively named ""Miss Bimbo"" Web site launched in the UK last month and is described as a ""virtual fashion game for girls."" Girls are encouraged to compete against each other to become the ""hottest, coolest, most famous bimbo in the whole world."" When a girl signs up, they are given a naked virtual character to look after and pitted against other girls to earn ""bimbo"" dollars so they can dress her in sexy outfits and take her clubbing. Sound off: What do you think about the ""Miss Bimbo"" Web site? They are told ""stop at nothing,"" even ""meds or plastic surgery,"" to ensure their dolls win. Users are given missions, including securing plastic surgery at the game's clinic to give their dolls bigger breasts, and they have to keep her at her target weight with diet pills, which cost 100 bimbo dollars. Breast implants sell at 11,500 bimbo dollars and net the buyer 2,000 bimbo attitudes, making her more popular on the site. And bagging a billionaire boyfriend is the most desirable way to earn the all important ""mula"" or bimbo dollars. Working, it seems, is a bit of a chore in bimbo world. The site says: ""Bimbo dollars is 'the cabbage,' 'bread,' the 'mula' you'll need to buy nice things and to get by in bimbo world. To earn some bimbo cash you will have to (gasp) work or find a boyfriend to be your sugar daddy and hook you up with a phat expense account!"" The advice on feeding the dolls is even more spurious, encouraging them to feed the dolls ""every now and then"" even though they want to keep their Bimbos ""waif thin."" The British version already has nearly 200,000 players, most of whom are girls aged between 7 and 17, according to the Web site. Although it is free to play, when the contestants run out of virtual dollars they have to send cell phone text messages costing $3 each or use PayPal to top up their accounts. In France, where ""Miss Bimbo's"" sister Web site, ""Ma Bimbo,"" was criticized by dieticians and parents when it began last year, one parent threatened the creators with legal action after his daughter ran up a $200 mobile bill sending texts without his knowledge, according to the Times of London newspaper. Parents' groups are horrified that the game is taking off in Britain, fearing it could send the wrong message about eating disorders and plastic surgery to young girls . Bill Hibberd, of parents' rights group Parentkind, told the Times the game sends a dangerous message to young girls. He said: ""It is one thing if a child recognizes it as a silly and stupid game. ""But the danger is that a nine-year-old fails to appreciate the irony and sees the Bimbo as a cool role model. Then the game becomes a hazard and a menace."" One parent also told The Times the creators were irresponsible. Nick Williams said he was appalled when he saw his daughters Katie, nine, and Sarah, 14, playing the game. Williams, 42, an accountant, said: ""I noticed them looking at possible breast operations and facelifts for their bimbos at the game's plastic surgery clinic. ""Katie is far too young for that kind of thing and it is irresponsible of the site's creators to be leading young girls astray. They are easily influenced at that age as to what is cool."" However, the creators of ""Miss Bimbo"" claim it is ""harmless fun."" Nicolas Jacquart, the 23-year-old Web designer from Tooting, south London, who created it was quoted in the Daily Mail as saying: ""It is not a bad influence for young children. They learn to take care of their bimbos. The missions and goals are morally sound and teach children about the real world."" He added: ""The breast operations are just one part of the game and we are not encouraging young girls to have them, just reflecting real life.""

"How can it be? The United States and Iran, sworn enemies for 35 years, are talking about working together to quell the al Qaeda-inspired insurgency sweeping northern Iraq. Such cooperation sounds unthinkable. They are fierce adversaries on issues such as terrorism, Iran's nuclear ambitions and Syria's civil war. Iranian leaders call the United States the ""Great Satan,"" while former President George W. Bush labeled Iran as part of an ""Axis of Evil."" It was headline news last year when their leaders spoke briefly by phone, the first contact at that level since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 drove the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from power. But should we be too surprised by this latest version of strange bedfellows, now known as ""frenemies"" in the modern vernacular? There's even an old saying of uncertain origin to define it --  the enemy of my enemy is my friend. What's going on? This time, the common enemy is the threat of a regional war based on sectarian battle lines, pitting Sunni and Shia Muslim governments and peoples against each other across the Middle East. Only the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its al Qaeda backers would want that, it seems. They seek to establish a Sunni-dominated Islamic state stretching from Iraq to northern Syria. ""We are now closer than ever to a regional war in the Middle East,"" said Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, who heads the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria. ""Events in neighboring Iraq will have grave and violent repercussions for Syria. The most dangerous aspect of these developments has been the rise of the sectarian threat, a direct consequence of the dominance of extremist groups like ISIS."" Shiite majority Iran seeks to protect Shia interests and power in Iraq, while the United States wants to see a stable Iraq after pulling its troops out of the country in 2011 to end its eight-year campaign that began by toppling Saddam Hussein from power. Also, Iran has sounded a more positive tone toward the West since last year's election of President Hassan Rouhani to succeed the more volatile Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. On Wednesday, Rouhani pledged that Iran would do whatever was necessary to protect  Shia holy sites in Iraq. Where do things stand? U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry suggested possible collaboration with Iran, telling Yahoo News on Monday that ""we are open to discussions if there's something constructive that can be contributed by Iran -- if Iran is prepared to do something that is going to respect the integrity and sovereignty of Iraq."" Then, the United States and Iran held ""very brief discussions"" about Iraq and the threat posed by ISIS on the sidelines of nuclear negotiations in Vienna, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. A senior State Department official said while Washington was open to engaging the Iranians, ""these engagements will not include military coordination or strategic determinations about Iraq's future over the heads of the Iraqi people."" The official said on condition of not being identified that the discussion concerns the ISIS threat to ""many countries in the region, including Iran,"" as well as the need to support a more inclusive approach by the Iraqi government than the sectarian efforts by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. What's in it for the United States? Defense Minister Chuck Hagel noted Wednesday that the United States and Iran cooperated early in the Afghanistan war. He told a congressional panel that ""we had worked with the Iranians on that western border of Afghanistan."" ""So there's some history here of sharing common interests,"" Hagel said, citing ""significant differences"" with Iran, but adding that ""I don't think these issues come neatly wrapped in geopolitical graduate school papers."" Even a conservative member of Congress who once advocated military strikes on Iran said Washington may need Tehran's help. ""I'll talk to anybody to help our people from being captured or killed,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. ""And this is a time where the Iranians in a small way might help."" Graham made clear he disapproved of Iran, calling authorities ""thugs and killers,"" then summed up the situation by saying: ""But we are where we are."" A host of experts agree, including Meghan O'Sullivan, a former deputy national security adviser during the Iraq war. ""There is a political solution here that I think could be both in Iran's interest and the U.S. interest,"" O'Sullivan said. Whether the United States likes it or not, working with Iran on the Iraq crisis might be a necessary evil, retired Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks said. ""There are necessary steps that we have to take with Tehran that we've probably never taken before, and would prefer not to take,"" Marks said. What's the downside? Teaming up with Iran could certainly have its pitfalls. The United States is wary of furthering Iran's already considerable influence in Iraq. The Shiite Iranian regime is Maliki's closest ally in the region, and a U.S.-Iranian partnership could alienate Iraq's Sunni population as well as Sunni nations in the region such as Saudi Arabia that are U.S. allies. Meanwhile, the United States doesn't want to jeopardize international talks on Iran's nuclear program that resumed this week. The talks are intended to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and the United States and Israel have repeatedly said they would use military means against Iran if necessary to achieve that outcome. House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that the United States should ""absolutely not"" talk to Iranians about the  Iraq crisis. ""I can just imagine what our friends in the region, our allies will be thinking by reaching out to Iran at a time when they continue to pay for terrorists and foster terrorism not only in Syria, in Lebanon but in Israel as well,"" the Ohio Republican told reporters. Will Iran and the U.S. work together on the ground? A senior security official in Baghdad said Iran has already sent about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to help fight the ISIS militants. Rouhani then denied that happened, but said he would be open to helping if asked, according to Iranian state TV. A Pentagon spokesman said Monday that military coordination with Iran was not in the cards, similar to what the senior State Department official told CNN. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said Obama has ruled out sending any U.S. combat troops to Iraq. However, Graham noted the need to coordinate in other ways, such as coordinating possible U.S. air strikes on ISIS fighters if Obama orders them. ""If we start flying airplanes, it makes some sense to talk to the Iranians about what we're doing so they don't shoot us down and we don't bomb them,"" he said.

"How do you solve a problem like email? Google's Gmail team thinks it knows how: with a new app called Inbox. Inbox, which launched Wednesday, offers a different way of handling the daily avalanche of email. Specifically created with mobile users in mind, it sorts and turns emails into reminders, highlights the important bits and adds outside information it thinks is helpful. Even as people are turning to other tools to quickly communicate from their phones -- messaging apps, social networks, text -- email remains an invaluable if sometimes infuriating way of communicating from mobile devices.  You can filter out spam, something Gmail excels at, but there's still a huge volume of legitimate email to deal with. A lot of companies have taken a stab at improving the email experience. Gmail recently started categorizing emails automatically and putting them in different tabs in your inbox, like social, promotions and updates. The popular third-party app Mailbox used folders and gestures to make sorting through emails easy. That company was snapped up by Dropbox. Inbox seems to be heavily influenced by Mailbox's time-saving, reminder-centric approach (not to mention its name). It also borrows some neat features from Google Now. Inbox works by grouping similar messages together, like bills, in what Google calls ""Bundles."" You can schedule a bundle to only show up at specific intervals, say once a week. There's no need to read all the words in an email just to get to the juicy bits. Inbox will highlight what it thinks are the key parts of an email, like contact information, confirmation numbers or photos. It's also tapping Google for related information to save you a trip to the search engine. For example, if you've set a reminder to call the dog groomer, the business's contact information will show up automatically. Messages can be turned into reminders, reminders can be snoozed, and important emails ""pinned"" while the rest are whisked away. Inbox is currently only invite only. It is available as and iOS and Android app, as well as a desktop view (for Chrome browser users only).","Google unveils new Inbox app for Gmail users .

"A California artist is turning people into paintings. Alexa Meade skips the canvas in her artwork. Instead, she physically paints on human subjects -- on their clothes, their shoes, their skin, their hair. Then she places them in a real-life setting and photographs it. The result is an image that looks like a painting within a photo. It's an optical illusion that blurs the lines of where reality ends and art begins. ""We are so used to taking things at face value. And then all of a sudden, something defies your perception. It makes you rethink what you've seen there,"" Meade said. Meade's work comes together in four steps -- painting, photography, art installations and performance art. ""I like for my work to create this living element. When you look at a photo of one of my installations, you see the painted thing but then you actually see the person coming through it,"" said the 27-year-old, who lives in Los Angeles. ""You see the eyes, the hair, and these signs of life. It creates this beautiful tension between the painted surface and the photographed person beneath it."" A chance career . Meade's talent for turning a three-dimensional scene into what looks like a two-dimensional painting almost went unnoticed. ""A lot of people ask me where I went to art school, but I didn't study art. I studied politics,"" said the Vassar College graduate. ""I set up this really comfortable career path for myself ... but I realized I'd always dreamed of being an artist. ... At 22, I decided that I would pick this up and make it my job to teach myself how to paint."" Instead of sitting behind a desk, Meade ended up in her parents' basement in Washington, painting on grapefruits, fried eggs and sausage. She started painting on people by chance. ""When I originally started this project, the idea was to capture shadows. I started putting black paint down on shadows and then I started putting black paint on people on the shadows,"" she said. ""Before I knew it, I was turning people into paintings."" But following her passion meant finding creative ways to make a living. ""Making art is something that comes out of you, but the job of being an artist is something completely different,"" she said. ""It was really terrifying going from this idea of having a steady job trying to make a career in politics to becoming an artist. ... I've had to be quite entrepreneurial with figuring out how I could support myself through my artwork."" When Meade first started her career, she didn't have any art shows. So she created one. She painted a man in her basement and then photographed him on the D.C. subway. ""It was like the greatest art opening ever. Everyone was asking what was going on and taking photos,"" she said. ""The art show on the subway turned out to be one of my most iconic pieces of work."" A boost from the Internet . Meade got her big break when a post about her work went viral. ""There was this blog post ... on body painting. And my friend wrote in the comments, 'You should check out Alexa Meade's work,'"" she said. ""The next day the blogger posted a photo of my work, a 12-word caption and a link to my website. And then all of a sudden overnight it went totally viral.

"He doesn't trust Iran, vows it won't get nuclear weapons, and believes past rhetoric by its leaders threatening annihilation of Israel is unacceptable and kind of insane. So why is Secretary of State John Kerry so adamant about getting time to try to negotiate an agreement that would further curb Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for lifting crippling economic sanctions? The former Senator spent 2 1/2 hours at a House Foreign Affairs Committee . hearing on Tuesday defending the international negotiations last month that brought an interim deal with Iran intended to lead to a comprehensive agreement after six months. Facing skeptical legislators from both parties, Kerry tried to assure them that he shares their mistrust of Iran while asking that they halt the drive for new sanctions for now to give negotiations, which also involve the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany, a chance to succeed. He bristled when yet another GOP legislator, Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, described the U.S. position as giving Iran the benefit of the doubt by not requiring the dismantling of all centrifuges needed to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. ""I sat here and said we're skeptical. I sat here and said they've got to prove it,"" Kerry responded, adding ""there's no benefit of any doubt here."" His takeaway message borrowed from former President Ronald Reagan's ""trust but verify"" guideline for a weapons deal with the Soviet Union, but Kerry modified it to reflect the lack of trust in Tehran's intentions. ""Test and verify,"" he said repeatedly in describing restrictions on Iran's program in the interim agreement, as well as the necessary monitoring and testing for a final agreement acceptable to President Barack Obama that would ensure Iran would be unable to develop nukes. A bipartisan group of Senators is working on new sanctions legislation and the House may consider a similar measure, prompted by concern that the interim agreement eased some sanctions without achieving the goal of ridding Iran of its centrifuges and other technology needed to build a nuclear bomb. However, the interim deal reached last month in Geneva prohibits new sanctions, and Kerry argued Tuesday that such a step was unnecessary at this point. ""They know that if they fail, sanctions will be increased,"" Kerry said of Iran. ""We've said it a hundred times and you all have said it a hundred times and they know you're yearning to go do it but you don't need to do it. It is actually gratuitous in the context of this situation because you can do it in a week if you need to when we say, 'this ain't working, we need your help,' and believe me we'll be prepared to do that."" On Middle East visit, Kerry sees hope of progress for Iran, Israel . After Kerry's remarks Tuesday, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee said the panel would hold off on considering new sanctions legislation for now. The statement by Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson of South Dakota left open the possibility of Senate leaders taking up the bill without having it go through the committee. Earlier, Kerry declared that ""Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon,"" calling the stance the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's foreign policy. The interim agreement eases some $7 billion in economic sanctions in return for limiting aspects of Iran's nuclear program, Kerry told the committee. Israel opposes that deal because it allows Iran -- a longtime enemy of  the Jewish state -- to continue enriching uranium needed to develop nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear that Israel would attack Iran's nuclear facilities if it felt threatened, and the negotiations are considered an effort to avoid a possible military confrontation in the volatile Middle East. In Congress, legislators from both parties agree that tougher measures are needed. ""We are facing an immoral and very dangerous regime in Iran, one nearing a nuclear weapon,"" Rep. Ed Royce, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Republican chairman, said at Tuesday's hearing. ""I am hard pressed to understand why we'd be letting up sanctions pressure at the very time its economy is on the ropes without getting an agreement which stops its centrifuges from spinning."" Others used more graphic language, with GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama comparing Iran's threats against Israel to Nazi Germany. ""What can you say to Israel and the rest of our allies in the Middle East to convince them that America is still a reliable ally, that America will enforce agreements with Iran or else, and that America is not ignoring history and repeating the 1930s Neville Chamberlain-like pattern of appeasement and retreat that helped trigger World War II and the death of tens of millions of people around the world?"" Brooks asked. Kerry responded by ""condemning in the strongest language possible those expressions of hate and of, you know, sheer and utter insanity, almost, asking for a country to be wiped off the face of the map."" ""That language is the most abhorrent kind of language you can find in any discourse of public life,"" he said. ""It has no place in a reasonable world. It's unacceptable, and we should never hear that kind of language again."" Iranian officials have long said the country's nuclear intentions were peaceful. They also warned any new sanctions would scuttle the interim agreement, noting that language in the document specifies no new ones can occur. Obama said over the weekend that he would accept a peaceful nuclear program in Iran, including modest uranium enrichment. However, Royce said the key issue is whether an eventual final agreement negotiated on the world stage with Iran would permit it to ""manufacture nuclear fuel."" ""Unfortunately, the interim agreement raises some questions about this,"" he said. ""My concern is that we may have bargained away our fundamental position, which is enshrined in six U.N. Security Council Resolutions -- and that fundamental agreement is that Iran should not be enriching and reprocessing. We may bargain that away for a false confidence that we can effectively check Iran's"" misuse of the nuclear weapons technologies. GOP Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona said the Iranians ""can get all the nuclear material they need for power by purchasing it from other countries,"" adding that ""they don't need to enrich it themselves."" Kerry stopped short of declaring a final agreement with Iran would prevent any uranium enrichment capability for Tehran, saying such details must be worked out. He noted that the interim agreement reached last month requires full consensus on such matters. To legislators calling for more sanctions, Kerry said economic strictures alone had failed to prevent Iran from expanding its centrifuges in recent years as it made progress toward developing a nuclear weapon. ""The issue here is what are we going to do about it so we don't have a sudden breakout,"" he said, adding that the interim agreement is a step toward that. ""In order to weaponize, you have to have highly enriched uranium. Under the agreement, they can't have highly enriched uranium."" Royce, though, noted that Iran has ""a history of deceiving the international community about its nuclear program, and is pursuing a ballistic missile program in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions,"" adding that it ""simply can't be trusted with enrichment technology, because verification efforts can never be foolproof.""","""We're skeptical,"" Kerry says of Iran's intentions .

"An American Airlines pilot booted Alec Baldwin off a flight Tuesday because the actor refused to turn off his cell phone after the plane's doors were closed for departure, the airline said Wednesday. ""The passenger was extremely rude to the crew, calling them inappropriate names and using offensive language,"" the company said in a statement posted on its Facebook page. Baldwin, in a column published by The Huffington Post Wednesday, apologized to fellow passengers who were delayed by the incident.  But he blamed a flight attendant who ""singled me out to put my phone away"" while other passengers continued to use theirs. ""I guess the fact that this woman, who had decided to make some example of me, while everyone else was left undisturbed, did get the better of me,"" Baldwin wrote. After Baldwin refused to turn off his cell phone, with the seat belt light on for departure, he walked into the toilet with his phone, the airline said. ""He slammed the lavatory door so hard, the cockpit crew heard it and became alarmed, even with the cockpit door closed and locked,"" the airline said.  ""They immediately contacted the cabin crew to check on the situation."" ""Given the facts above, the passenger was removed from the flight and denied boarding,"" the company said. The ""confusion"" started after the plane remained at the gate for 15 minutes after the door closed, Baldwin wrote. ""I then did what I have nearly always done and that was to pull out my phone to complete any other messaging I had to do before take off,"" he said.  ""In nearly all other instances, the flight attendants seemed to be unbothered ... and said nothing about such activity, by me or anyone else, until we actually were pulling away from the gate."" Although other passengers were still using their phones, a female flight attendant ""singled me out to put my phone away,"" he said. He pulled his phone out again after the plane remained at the gate, he said.  ""Again, I was singled out by this woman in the most unpleasant of tones."" Boxer Oscar De LaHoya, who was also on the plane, posted a Twitter message of support for the actor, saying, ""I think the flight attendant over reacted.' Word of Baldwin's clash with the crew spread worldwide within minutes of his being escorted from the New York-bound flight at a Los Angeles International Airport gate, because of Twitter postings by Baldwin and a passenger. ""On an AA flight at LAX. Alec Baldwin removed from the plane We had to go back to the gate. Terrible that everyone had to wait,"" tweeted Michael J. Wolf, a consulting firm executive who was a passenger on the flight. A short time later, Baldwin tweeted to his nearly 600,000 followers: ""Flight attendant on American reamed me out 4 playing WORDS W FRIENDS while we sat at the gate, not moving."" When CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin -- no relation -- tagged Alec Baldwin in a tweet asking about ""Words with Friends,"" the actor replied, ""It's...well....addicting."" ""Words With Friends"" is a digital word-building game popular on several platforms. Another Baldwin tweet took aim at the crew, saying he would never again fly on American Airlines, ""where retired Catholic school gym teachers from the 1950's find jobs as flight attendants."" The star of NBC's ""30 Rock"" noted in his tweets that ""oddly, 30 Rock plays inflight on American."" A posting on the airline's Twitter account showed the company was trying to reach Baldwin. ""Mr. Baldwin, we are looking into this. Please DM us contact information,"" the company tweeted. In his column, he said he had happily flown American Airlines for 20 years and until now was ""brand loyal, in the extreme."" Most of the flight attendants ""still have some remnant of the old idea of service,"" he said.  ""But there are many now who walk the aisles of an airplane with a whistle around their neck and a clipboard in their hands and they have made flying a Greyhound bus experience."" ""The lesson I've learned is to keep my phone off when the 1950's gym teacher is on duty,"" he wrote. Despite the apparent distress, Baldwin's journey resumed. ""Now on the 3 o'clock American flight. The flight attendants already look.....smarter,"" he tweeted. Baldwin arrived at New York's JFK Airport on an American Airlines flight Tuesday evening.","Flight attendant ""singled me out"" as others kept using their phones, Baldwin says .

"To many of his neighbors, Colorado school gunman Karl Pierson was the wholesome boy next door who liked achievement and ran on the cross country team. He even worked on an Eagle Scout project two years ago. To schoolmates, Pierson was known for his outspoken intelligence that served him well on the debate team. But at times, he acted ""weird"" and alienated peers with rants about communism and his aggressiveness to win every argument, they said. One neighbor described him as bright but a social misfit whose peers ridiculed him. His mother had transferred him from another high school because of the mockery and altercations, the neighbor said. Pierson, 18, opened fire Friday inside Arapahoe High School, where he was a senior. Claire Davis, 17, was wounded in a point-blank shooting, and Pierson, who apparently didn't know Davis, then killed himself in the library, Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson told reporters Friday. ""He was a really smart kid. He was intelligent. He knew how to speak; he really did. I don't think I ever won an argument with that kid,"" junior Daylon Stutz said in the school parking lot on Saturday, when students were allowed to retrieve their cars. Stutz, an offensive tackle on the football team, had known Pierson since the two shared a human behavior class when Stutz was a freshman and Pierson a sophomore. They worked on a class experiment together in which they went into the community and tried breaking unwritten rules, Stutz said. ""I did think he was a little weird, but I didn't think he was, like, bad weird,"" Stutz added. ""He always kind of talked about how America was a communist country, how the government was, like, trying to take us over and stuff. I don't know, just some weird stuff that I didn't really pay close attention to, but nothing that alarmed me. ""He was definitely kind to me. I never saw him mean to anybody. He wasn't condescending to anyone,"" he said. In Friday's shooting, Pierson was armed with a shotgun, a bandolier stocked with ammunition, a machete and three Molotov cocktails, Robinson said. Pierson fired five shots within 1 minute and 20 seconds, he said. Pierson entered his school looking for the debate team's coach, CNN affiliate KUSA reported, citing Robinson. Pierson was apparently seeking revenge against a faculty member because of a ""confrontation or disagreement,"" the sheriff said. High school senior Frank Woronoff said he had known Pierson since they were freshmen. ""He was the last person I would expect to shoot up a high school,"" Woronoff said. ""He was pretty geeky and nerdy but in a charming way, one of the nicest, most humble people I know,"" he added. Senior Chris Davis, 18, was among many students Saturday trying to make sense of Pierson's shooting rampage. ""He was a weird kid,"" Davis said. ""He's a self-proclaimed communist, just wears Soviet shirts all the time."" Pierson became easily aggravated, ""always liked to be right"" and didn't like losing, Davis said. ""It seems realistic, now, that he did it,"" Davis added. The home where authorities believe Pierson armed himself is five miles from his school and appeared vacant Saturday. Its front door was sealed and boarded a day after federal agents raided the property and executed search warrants. Why? Sheriff wants to know reason for Colorado school shooting . A man who declined to be identified in an CNN interview lives a few doors away and said he has known Pierson since he was a boy. In the last few days, the neighbor noticed Pierson driving at excessive speeds throughout their normally quiet, modest middle-class suburb. The neighbor said Pierson's mother, Barbara, transferred her son to Arapahoe High School from nearby Highland Ranch High School because her son had been subjected to constant ridicule and physical altercations. ""He was socially awkward and just didn't seem to fit into the larger teenage groups, and I think that weighed on him,"" the neighbor told CNN. Lessons of Columbine and other school shootings helped in Arapahoe . The neighbor said Pierson's parents had been separated for years, and Karl was living with his mother and younger sister. ""While Karl was socially a misfit around kids his age, he was intellectually bright and loved to debate in school,"" the neighbor said. ""If he was disciplined in a debate class, that must have meant everything to him. It may have been trigger point."" Pierson was active in his community, KUSA reported. He took pride in how he routinely won contests on his speech and debate team, the station reported. He showed off his first place and second place trophies online. One neighbor described him as a ""nice young man,"" the affiliate said. In fact, the TV outlet interviewed him seven years ago about the design of a quarter commemorating Colorado. Pierson submitted questions to the station in 2008 for a show about the Colorado Supreme Court and asked a question at a U.S. Senate debate in 2010, the news outlet said.

"(CNN) -- It's been 145 years since Abraham Lincoln appeared on a ballot, but admiration for the man who saved the union and sparked the end of slavery is as strong as ever, according to a new survey. Abraham Lincoln, seen in an 1861 photo, tops the list of former presidents in a new survey of historians. Lincoln finished first in a ranking by historians of the 42 former White House occupants. The survey was released over Presidents Day weekend. The news wasn't quite as good for the latest addition to the nation's most exclusive fraternity: George W. Bush finished 36th in the survey, narrowly edging out the likes of historical also-rans Millard Fillmore, Warren Harding and Franklin Pierce. James Buchanan -- the man who watched helplessly as the nation lurched toward civil war in the 1850s -- finished last. ""As much as is possible, we created a poll that was non-partisan, judicious and fair-minded,"" said Rice University professor Douglas Brinkley, who helped organize the survey of 65 historians for cable television network C-SPAN. The survey -- which asked participants to rank each president on 10 qualities of leadership ranging from public persuasion and economic management to international relations and moral authority -- was the network's second since 2000.  See which presidents ranked highest and lowest » . The hero of Springfield, Illinois, finished first nine years ago as well. ""It's fitting that for the 200th birthday of Abraham Lincoln that he remains at the top of these presidential rankings,"" Brinkley said. ""Lincoln continues to rank at the top in all categories because he is perceived to embody the nation's avowed core values: integrity, moderation, persistence in the pursuit of honorable goals, respect for human rights, compassion,"" Howard University's Edna Medford added. Founding father George Washington finished second in the new survey, followed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, and Harry Truman, in that order. Bill Clinton registered the greatest gain among recent presidents, jumping from 21st to 15th in the survey. Ronald Reagan edged forward from 11th to 10th overall, while George H.W. Bush moved up from 20th to 18th. The prize for the greatest jump in approval from historians over the last nine years, however, went to a president who has often sat near the bottom of such rankings: Ulysses S. Grant. The Civil War general jumped 10 notches, from 33rd to 23rd. Grant has traditionally received poor marks for corruption among people in his administration and the failed postwar reconstruction effort he presided over. But the nation's 18th president may be getting a bounce from all of the recent attention focused on Lincoln, Medford said. ""Grant won the war for Lincoln,"" she noted during an appearance on C-SPAN's ""Washington Journal."" ""A new look at the totality of his career may be improving his presidential stature,"" she said. ""Bill Clinton and Ulysses S. Grant aren't often mentioned in the same sentence -- until now,"" historian Richard Norton Smith said. ""Participants in the latest [survey] have boosted each man significantly higher than in the original survey conducted in 2000. All of which goes to show two things: the fluidity with which presidential reputations are judged, and the difficulty of assessing any president who has only just recently left office."" In his final news conference before stepping down last month, George W. Bush made it clear he wasn't concerned with poor initial judgments of his presidency. ""There is no such thing as short-term history,"" Bush said. ""I don't think you can possibly get the full breadth of an administration until time has passed."" The survey's participants ranked Bush 41st on international relations and 40th on economic management -- ahead of only Herbert Hoover.","65 historians ranked former presidents on various leadership qualities .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Nearly 1,000 people rallied in scorching temperatures Saturday to speak out against people giving Arizona heat for its controversial new immigration law. ""They're attacking Arizona as a state that's racist and Nazi, and we're here to say that, no, we're not. We're for what America stands for, the melting pot, equality for all,"" said rally organizer Dan Amato, who traveled from Pennsylvania to Arizona for the event. Organizers said they wanted to change the perception that supporters of SB 1070, and the law itself, are racist. Nearly half of the speakers at the event were of Hispanic or Mexican ancestry. The law allows police to ask for proof of legal residency when investigating a suspected crime. Critics say it will lead to racial profiling and prevent police from doing their jobs by undermining trust in the Latino community. City governments and organizations opposed to the law have targeted Arizona with protests and boycotts. Participants in Saturday's rally said they wanted to fight back by giving the state an economic boost. And they said they want other states to follow Arizona's lead by passing legislation to crack down on illegal immigration, claiming the federal government has refused to do the job. Protesters waved signs that read ""Don't pander to non-citizens"" and ""Lawbreakers don't love America."" More than 100 motorcyclists showed their support by circling the rally on their bikes. ""It is about culture, not race, because the American culture, I feel, is under assault, because they are not embracing our culture,"" said Ruth Miller, another rally organizer. Carmen Morales, who traveled to the rally from New Jersey, stressed that not all Hispanics are against the new law. ""This is about enforcing the law,"" she said. ""It's about securing our borders."" Other speakers included Republican state Sen. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the law, former Republican presidential candidate and Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo, and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. ""This new law, okay, it was passed. Let's hope it's enforced,"" Arpaio told CNN after his speech. ""Because I'm going to enforce it. I'm going to arrest anybody that violates that state law and put them in my jail, not turn them over to the federal government.""","Supporters of Arizona immigration law say they're not racist .

"Former teen idol David Cassidy faces his third drunken driving charge  after being stopped for an illegal turn in Los Angeles on Friday night. Cassidy, 63, blew .19% -- twice the legal level --  on an alcohol test administered by the California Highway Patrol officer who stopped the singer-actor's rented Chevrolet Impala, according to a CHP statement Saturday. The former star of the TV series ""The Partridge Family"" was booked in a Los Angeles jail on a driving under the influence of alcohol charge early Saturday, the statement said. Jail records show he was freed on $15,000 bond several hours later. ""Cassidy was observed making a right turn on a red light, in violation of a black and white regulatory sign indicating, 'No Right Turn On Red,'"" the CHP said. The traffic stop happened off the 405 Freeway, near the Los Angeles International Airport. The officer noticed ""the odor of an alcoholic beverage was emitting from the vehicle"" when he approached Cassidy, who was alone in the car, the release said. Cassidy was arrested on a drunken driving charge in Schodack, New York, last August after he failed to dim his car's headlights at a police checkpoint, according to the police report. He blew a .10 in the Breathalyzer device, the report said. The legal blood alcohol limit is .08 in New York. Cassidy, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, entered a no contest plea as a first-time offender in February 2011 to a drunken driving charge that followed a November 2010 arrest in Florida. He was sentenced to a year's probation and his driver's license was suspended for six months for that conviction. He also attended a DUI school, paid a $500 fine and served 50 hours of community service. On the TV series, Cassidy played the eldest of five children of a widowed mother (Shirley Jones, who was Cassidy's real-life stepmother). The family, all musicians, traveled to gigs in a repainted school bus. When the show was canceled after four seasons, Cassidy launched his own pop music career, filling concert halls with screaming teenage girls attracted to such hits as ""I Think I Love You.""","Cassidy blew  .19%  on an alcohol test, the California Highway Patrol says .

"California Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday declared a drought emergency for the state, saying it is facing ""perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago."" The governor's announcement, made in San Francisco, came as a wildfire burned Friday with only 30% containment in 1,700 acres of foothills of Los Angeles County near Glendora. An illegal campfire apparently ignited the wildfire, and fire officials cited drought conditions as contributing to the blaze. In his declaration, the governor called for voluntary ""20% conservation of our water use"" statewide. ""It's important to wake all Californians to the serious matter of the drought and lack of rain,"" Brown told reporters. ""We are in an unprecedented, very serious situation that people should pause and reflect on how dependent we are on the  rain, nature and one other. ""This is an effort to call for arms,"" he continued. ""That's the point of the declaration."" Brown said he would set into motion an initiative that would make water transfers easier between regions in the state. The snowpack in California's mountains is at 20% of normal levels. The state's largest water reservoirs are below record lows, and the major waterways, including the Sacramento and the San Joaquin rivers, flow with ""significantly reduced"" water. Since 2011, extremely dry conditions have parched the state. Under the proclamation, Brown directed officials to take ""all necessary actions"" to address the drought, including assisting farmers and communities with water shortages. He directed state agencies to use less water and hire more firefighters. Ninety percent of California is in a severe drought, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""This could be a giant fire year coming up,"" Myers added. Meanwhile, about 800 firefighting personnel brought a Los Angeles-area wildfire under some control Friday, with 30% containment -- an improvement over 0% a day earlier. ""I've seen the sky turn gray from smoke before during fires here in Los Angeles, but this red sun was more eery than others,"" said CNN iReporter Corinne Shor from about a 20-minute drive away. ""I could also smell the fire and my eyes started to sting."" About 3,600 people at one point were ordered to evacuate, though that number had fallen to about 1,600 as of late Thursday night, according to  Angeles National Forest's update on the Incident Information System's website. The number of evacuees fell even further Friday, when police in the inland Southern California city of Azusa announced that select residents could return to their homes at 4 p.m. (7 p.m. ET). Residents of Mountain Cove in that city, however, were not being let back in due to continued ""concern for the roadway and homes in that area."" Meanwhile, a red flag warning was extended to Friday because of anticipated warm, dry breezes called Santa Ana winds, InciWeb said. The blaze began before dawn Thursday and allegedly originated with three men camping in the foothills near Glendora, authorities said. The campers were tossing paper into a campfire, and a gust of wind spread embers, authorities said. The three men, all in their early 20s, were arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting a fire, said Police Chief Tim Staab of Glendora. One man is from Glendora and another is from Irwindale, he said. The third man's home was not known. Bail was set Thursday at $20,000 for each. ""The way it's told to us is that all three of them were together at the time, sitting around this campfire,"" he said. ""Breeze kicked up, and that's what caused this fire. ""It's not a camping area, but people do camp up in the hills above Glendora,"" Staab said. The arrests were made after authorities received a call that at least two people were suspiciously walking away from the fire, the chief said. The three men arrested were identified as Jonathan Carl Jerrell, 23; Clifford Eugene Henry Jr., 22; and Steven Robert Aguirre, 21, police said. They and their attorneys couldn't be reached for comment. The wildfire, named the Colby Fire, destroyed two homes and injured one person Thursday morning, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said. The injured civilian suffered minor burns, Osby told reporters. ""We predicted that this is going to be an intense fire season because this is the third year of an ongoing drought,"" he said. There hasn't been a fire in Glendora's foothills since 1968, so the area has lots of brush and other fuel for a wildfire, authorities said.","Some in Azusa can return home, other wildfire evacuees cannot, police say .

"(CNN) -- When Bitcoin's architect first unleashed the idea of creating a decentralized virtual currency on the internet, the tech-savvy elite sat up and listened. That was in 2008. Just a year later, operating under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown developer took the concept live. By year-end, over 1.6 million bitcoins had been mined. Since then, the meteoric rise of the digital currency has continued to capture the world's attention as financial institutions now examine its viability. At a time when many have lost faith in the global financial system, Bitcoin is being hailed as the future of e-commerce. ""It's lower cost, lower risk and a more accessible form of payment from anything else we have today, especially for shopping online,"" says Tony Gallippi, founder of BitPay, a Bitcoin payment processing service. ""Credit cards were designed in the 1950s and were never designed for the Internet. It leads to issues like identity theft and payment fraud."" Gallippi -- who recently testified before a U.S. Senate committee on the growth of Bitcoin -- explains that the virtual peer-to-peer currency was created to be ""borderless by design,"" thus opening the door to the international marketplace for smaller merchants. Internet's currency of choice . The anonymity of the currency is also a plus for Bitcoin users as no verified personal data is required for making online transactions. This has led many to speculate that Bitcoin will be mainly used for illegal online transactions. ""For small businesses that have unique items, it really opens up their business to a truly worldwide customer base ... It's going to become the default payment system for the internet by the end of this decade,"" adds Gallippi. While Bitcoin's electronic nature makes it appealing for e-commerce, Gallippi acknowledges that there are still some kinks in the system that need to be ironed out. ""Tax implications and potential regulation are some obstacles we face ... the other issue is that perhaps [Bitcoin] is not quite ready for mainstream consumers just yet. ""I think we've got quite a bit more work to do on the engineering side ... But I would expect Bitcoin will soon become the preferred method of payment for connecting businesses over the Internet,"" predicts Gallippi. The implications for e-commerce from the Bitcoin experiment continue to intrigue economists and financial analysts as some believe the crypto-currency could revolutionize the global marketplace. Bitcoin to replace traditional banking? ""For more conventional businesses, I think the advantages are really in international commerce,"" says Tom Elliott, director for the Emerging Markets Communications Strategies service at Strategic Analysts. ""You have significantly reduced transaction costs compared to converting one international currency to another international currency -- it's typically cheaper."" Meanwhile, Jon Rushman, an economist and professor at Warwick Business School says: ""The brilliance behind the technical design of Bitcoin is the fact that the mechanism for payment is a distributed network. No one owns it. It doesn't run in a data center owned by PayPal or Mastercard or Visa."" The added bonus? No middlemen taking a cut from the transaction, he says. Rushman explains the currency's recent surge is largely responsible for grabbing the financial world's attention. Erratic price value . In January 2013, one Bitcoin was worth around $13, surging in November to a staggering all-time high of $1,242 -- almost the same price as an ounce of gold. But since then, its value has dropped again to around $925, according to Mt.Gox exchange rates. And, according to Rushman, Bitcoin's erratic fluctuation is exactly what deters some businesses from adopting the currency: ""You wouldn't want to reprice every article in your shop everyday, which is why we like standard exchange rates."" ""[If] you're a retailer and you carry Â£100 ($164) in your till overnight, normally you're not really worried about the fact that it's going to still be Â£100 in the morning. ""It could indeed become the system of payment [online], but it has to get over this hurdle of volatility. You have to bridge that gap between what we trust today and the type of thing we might trust tomorrow."" But while some tout Bitcoin as the future of online shopping, others are describing it as the latest monetary fad. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at UK-based foreign exchange firm, World First, says Bitcoin is a mere internet affectation. ""It still appears to be a very niche payment option ... until the volatility calms down, the use of it as a payment method -- to buy shopping, a house, a car, send children to university for example -- is going to be very, very limited. ""Traders don't want volatility in the currency that they are taking in. They don't want additional cost,"" he adds. The China conundrum . Despite these concerns, some central banks have begun to throw their weight behind the virtual currency. Germany announced it recognized Bitcoin as ""private money"" -- but until more central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, back it, Bitcoin will remain a niche digital payment option, warns Cook. One key country that Bitcoin enthusiasts and analysts have been closely watching is China. ""The Chinese are the big, big domino to fall. If the Chinese get behind it, then it will become a part of an Internet revolution,"" says Cook. But last Thursday the People's Bank of China placed a ban on financial institutions handling the money after stipulating that the virtual cash had no legal status. With yet another hurdle now in place for Bitcoin, Cook believes its widespread adoption is a little optimistic. ""Certainly, you can believe that the future of Internet commerce will involve these kind of instantaneous payment methods. I have no doubt about that -- but people want simplicity. ""At the moment, the Bitcoin experiment doesn't offer simplicity. It complicates matters by people having to understand another way of doing things.""

"From the outside, Italy's Credem Bank looks just like any other high security operation. And indeed, behind the barbed wire and electronic fence are piles of golden blocks. But they are not made of precious metal -- rather, they are ageing wheels of Parmesan cheese. As I walk inside, I am hit by the pungent smell and then, by the size of the vaults. Row after row, stacked up twenty shelves high, are 430,000 parmesan wheels. They're worth up to 190 million euros. The wheels are stored here as part of a cash-for-cheese loan that started with Credem bank, but dates back to the Medici era. Watch more: Historic German film studio faces challenges . In simple terms, the bank takes the cheese from local parmesan producers in exchange for a cheap loan. It charges between 3% to 5% interest, depending on the quality of the cheese, and a fee for making sure the cheese matures properly in their air-conditioned, humidified vault. This mechanism ensures that in the two years it takes the cheese to mature, credit keeps flowing. In these tough economic times, this allows producers to feed their cattle, pay their staff....and just keep producing. If for whatever reason, the cheese producer defaults on the loan, the bank has the cheese to sell on. Read more: Model trains and planes motor their way back home . It's no surprise then, Credem treats each wheel like gold. They clean it, turn it, hammer it, prick it and from time to time even taste certain batches. Cristian Bertolini, an expert taster with the Parmigiano Reggiano consortium, tells me each batch has to meet strict criteria. If it doesn't, the cheese is downgraded, the Parmigiano Reggiano imprint scraped off and then it's sold simply as Italian cheese.

For the Caretti family, who have been producing cheese since 1925, the loan is hard currency which has enabled them to keep doing what they love. Right now, they have their own vault on site, financed by the bank. From time to time, they still use the bigger Credem vault. It's a strategy that has paid off. Every day, they make thirty two wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano, adding up to almost twelve-thousand wheels a year. Read more: American apple pie warms struggling Spain .

"An Amber Alert has been issued in Oregon for a 16-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy believed to have been abducted by James DiMaggio, who authorities suspect kidnapped the children after their mother's body was found in his burned-down house in San Diego, the Oregon State Police said Wednesday. The alert was broadcast after a possible sighting Wednesday afternoon of a vehicle wanted in connection with the case, police said. A spokeswoman in San Diego later said the tip didn't pan out, but Lt. Gregg Hastings with the Oregon State Police said he hadn't heard that. ""We are not turning our back to this and we are doing what we can to locate that suspect vehicle and the missing children,"" he said. An arrest warrant for murder has been issued for DiMaggio. In the event of his arrest, a judge has signed off on a $1 million bond, said San Diego County Superior Court spokeswoman Karen Dalton. Also found in the home were charred human remains consistent with those of an 8-year-old child, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said Wednesday. Police are awaiting DNA tests to confirm whether the remains are of the missing boy, police said. A San Diego County sheriff's detective previously had said the remains could be those of Ethan Anderson, one of two children for whom the Amber Alert was issued. Meanwhile, Ethan's father made a public plea Tuesday to the suspect, who is believed to have abducted the boy's sister, Hannah. The father asked DiMaggio to release Hannah, who along with Ethan went missing after their mother was killed. A massive manhunt is under way for DiMaggio, 40, whom law enforcement authorities describe as a friend of the mother, Christina Anderson. DiMaggio was the owner and sole resident of the burned home where Anderson's body and the remains of the child were found. ""Jim, I can't fathom what you were thinking. The damage is done. I'm begging you to let my daughter go. You've taken everything else,"" Brett Anderson, the children's father, said in an appearance before reporters. ""Hannah, we all love you very much. If you have a chance, you take it, you run. You'll be found,"" he said. The father did not mention Ethan in his remarks, prompting a reporter to ask San Diego County Sheriff's Department Lt. Glenn Giannantonio whether the remains of the child found in the house might be those of the boy. ""We don't know who that is that was found in the rubble. It is a possibility that it's Ethan. It's a possibility that's another child that we haven't identified yet, or don't realize is missing yet,"" Giannantonio said. ""Right now, we just don't know, and we're praying that it wasn't Ethan,"" he said. Authorities are following up on tips and casting a wide net for DiMaggio and the children. ""We've received some information that either Texas or Canada may have been the destination he was heading to. Realistically, we don't know where they're going,"" Giannantonio said. ""We're looking everywhere."" The remains of Anderson, of Lakeside, California, were found while firefighters extinguished a blaze that broke out at DiMaggio's home in the enclave of Boulevard around 8 p.m. Sunday. Authorities believe she was killed. Her mother, Sara Britt, said Christina Anderson was 44 years old, not 42 as earlier reported. Hannah Anderson was last seen at 3 p.m. Saturday at cheerleading practice, according to Britt and her other daughter, Jennifer Willis. Ethan was supposed to be at football practice at 8 a.m. Sunday but never showed, the two relatives said. DiMaggio was like an uncle to the family, but he was having financial problems, the two relatives said. ""We know that they were lifelong friends. We're not exactly sure what that relationship was. We don't know if Hannah's with him willingly or not. We just don't know right now,"" San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 on Wednesday. California authorities also issued an Amber Alert. Once they did, information was distributed to residents' cell phones statewide through the Wireless Emergency Alert program, according to the California Highway Patrol. The wireless program was instituted in December 2012, and this was the first time it had been used statewide, CHP Public Information Officer Erin Komatsubara told HLN. On HLN's ""Raising America"" on Tuesday, the children's aunt, Andrea Saincome, said that DiMaggio had known the family for years and that it would not have been unusual for the mother and children to be at his house. ""There was nothing out of the ordinary,"" Saincome told HLN's Christi Paul. ""He seemed like a genuinely nice guy. He was close to the kids, and he was friends with my sister and my brother-in-law."" The children were reported missing by their grandparents on Sunday. Giannantonio said he did not know what led them to believe their grandchildren were missing. Giannantonio would not release any details about how Anderson was killed, but said arson investigators believe they know how the fire was started. Authorities also found burned weapons in the residence. The sheriff's office released several photos of DiMaggio, and Giannantonio said he was believed to be driving a blue, four-door Nissan Versa with California license plate 6WCU986. However, he might have switched vehicles, taken public transportation or be hunkered down somewhere, Giannantonio said. He asked for the public's help, as did Gore. ""We need all the eyes and ears out there we can get in trying to find both DiMaggio and hopefully those two kids,"" the sheriff said. ""Citizens should not try to interfere with this person at all. He's already proven he's a pretty dangerous fella."" Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the San Diego County Sheriff's Department Homicide Detail at 858-974-2321 or submit an anonymous tip to Crime Stoppers at 888-580-8477.","""We need all the eyes and ears out there we can get,"" sheriff says .

"Leanne Hecht Bearden may not be missing after all -- in fact, she might be missing by her own accord. That's what her family said Thursday, after days of pushing for help in finding the 33-year-old last seen leaving her in-law's house in Garden Ridge, Texas, just northeast of San Antonio. But the bottom line is that Bearden is still missing, nearly two weeks after she went for a walk. Pointing to investigative work done by the Garden Ridge police, the Comal County Sheriff's Office and Texas Rangers, the family said they now believe Bearden may have gone missing intentionally. ""There is evidence that Leanne may have voluntarily left the area, and we understand this is a strong possibility,"" the family said in a statement posted Thursday on a Facebook page devoted to finding the young woman. If nothing else, Bearden is a veteran traveler. In the last couple of years, she traveled the world with her husband, Josh Bearden, in an epic 22-month trek that she extensively documented in a blog. They climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, swam in the Dead Sea, attended an Indian wedding and much, much more. Then, in December, the couple returned to the United States. Her brother, Michael Hecht, said upon returning to the United States, the couple had spent a short time in Georgia, then went to Texas for a few weeks to visit Josh's family. He said they were working to find jobs in Denver, where the couple was married and had settled. Coming back to her native country wasn't necessarily easy, her family suggested. ""The pressure of transitioning from her two-year trip back into what we consider 'normal' life seems to have left her very anxious and stressed,"" they said. On January 17, Bearden told her family she'd be back in about an hour after setting out on a walk from her in-laws' residence where she and her husband were staying. Josh Bearden told CNN affiliate KENS-TV, ""She left on her own free will. That is what she did. That is absolutely true, but what happened after she left the house on her own free will I don't know."" He and other relatives and friends worked intently to spread the word after she didn't return, as the search for her expanded. Her brother told CNN two helicopters searched for nearly three hours six days after she was last seen, and that followed ground searches the previous two days. ""It's baffling right now about what happened. Maybe she fell and hurt herself. You start thinking about things. I don't think she had any enemies. She is loved very much,"" Hecht said then. The biggest such search -- covering 23 square miles, by air and land -- was last Saturday. Garden Ridge police noted their serious concern about Bearden last week, while adding ""there is no indication at this time that (her disappearance) is criminal in nature."" They and other authorities talked to relatives and friends, combed through e-mails and text messages, checked out phone records and contacts -- all in addition to looking for physical signs of her. But none of these efforts have revealed any ""evidence ... of her presence,"" according to her family. ""If Leanne has indeed fled the area, she is extremely vulnerable,"" they said. ""She left with only a few assets and is traveling very light."" The family added that while Bearden is athletic, ""she is small in stature."" ""Her mental and physical status is uncertain,"" they said. ""We fear for her greatly."" The Facebook page devoted to finding her continued pleading Thursday night -- shortly after the family's statement came out -- for the public's help, asking people to print and post fliers with her picture and share her story through social media. ""Continue to send your positive thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Leanne who are really in need of them now,"" the post said.","Leanne Bearden was reported missing January 17 after not returning from a walk .

"President Obama may not be a welcome sight on the campaign trail for Democrats in many key Senate races, but the first lady is a different story. Michelle Obama made her campaign trail debut Monday in the hotly contested Georgia race for the U.S. Senate. She headlined a fundraiser and a voter registration rally for Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn, among other Democratic candidates up for election in the Peach State. ""The stakes this year couldn't be higher. If we don't show up in the polls this November, if we don't elect leaders in Congress and here in Georgia who put people first instead of fighting for special interests, we know exactly what will happen,"" the first lady told an energized crowd, before going on to outline the familiar Democratic attack lines heard in the past two election cycles. ""We will see more folks interfering in women's private decisions about our health care. We'll see more folks denying that climate change even exists. We'll see more votes against equal pay and immigration reform and raising"" the minimum wage. The first lady's trip began with an event at Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta highlighting her Reach Higher initiative, which encourages High School students to pursue higher education. She delivered a speech to students and faculty. The speech, which lasted less than a half an hour, was briefly interrupted when a female student fainted, but the interruption was a short one. Obama paused, called for a medic to attend to the student, and continued with her remarks. The Georgia Senate race, an open contest as a result of the retirement of Sen. Saxby Chambliss, is a marquee contest of the 2014 cycle. The race is a sort of ""who's who"" of Georgia political families pitting Nunn, a nonprofit CEO and daughter of former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, against Republican candidate David Perdue, a businessman and cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue. Nunn campaign defends early campaign memo . Democrats see the contest as one of their best chances to pick up a Senate seat from Republicans in a midterm cycle where the party is primarily playing defense across the country. Winning that seat would greatly increase the Democrats' chance of keeping control of the upper chamber. High stakes . In a tight political contest in Georgia, Obama appeared to take a do-no-harm approach, staying away from controversial current events, focusing her remarks instead on the importance of registering to vote and turning out at the polls. ""Barack won because record numbers of women and minorities and young people showed up to vote,"" she said. ""But then, when the midterms come along, too many people, of our folks, just tuned out. See, that's what happens in the midterms,"" the first lady continued. ""When you stay home, they win."" Nunn, who spoke ahead of the first lady at Monday's event, is the former CEO of the nonpartisan organization Points of Light, a charity whose title is derived from the ""thousand points of light"" theme that George H.W. Bush spoke about frequently. President George H.W. Bush fights for Georgia Senate seat . She is considered to be one of the Democrats' two best possibilities for a pickup from the GOP. The other candidate considered to have a solid chance for a seat pick-up is Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. Republican senatorial candidate David Perdue has tied Nunn to the unpopular President Obama, arguing that once in Washington she would support the President's agenda entirely. A New York Times/CBS poll released on Monday showed Nunn 6 percentage points behind David Perdue, 47% to 41%. Currently, Democrats hold a five-seat majority in the Senate, and Democrats are up for re-election in seven states that went red in the 2012 presidential election, in addition to facing tough contests in places like Iowa, Michigan, Colorado and New Hampshire. The math is on the GOP's side, making Georgia's Senate contest that much more important for the Democratic Party. In her remarks, the first lady argued that if Republicans were to regain control of the senate in November, gridlock in Washington would get even worse. ""Frankly, if we lose these midterm elections, it's going to be a whole lot harder to finish what we started,"" she said, referring to the Obama administration's agenda. ""Because things will be even worse out of Washington."" A popular first lady . Although her husband's popularity is not great -- the most recent polling from CNN/ORC International shows his approval rating at 43% -- Michelle Obama still enjoys high approval ratings. A CNN poll (PDF) taken in May found that 61% of voters still have a favorable opinion of the first lady. Game on in pivotal Georgia Senate race . Obama has mostly stayed away from public events on the campaign trail this cycle, though she has done Democratic fundraisers. It remains to be seen whether these types of appearances will become more frequent in the coming weeks and months ahead of the midterm elections in November. Obama is not the only high-profile figure to stump for Nunn; Bill Clinton is scheduled to attend a fundraiser for the Democratic candidate this month hosted by singer and Atlanta resident Usher. Advice to students . Her first stop in Georgia was headlining an event with Education Secretary Arne Duncan at Booker T. Washington High School, which counts Martin Luther King Jr. among its graduates. The Reach Higher initiative, launched this year, is designed to encourage students to further their education beyond high school, seeking out some form of higher education, with the goal of helping the United States regain the top spot as the country with the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. Speaking to a room of high school students, Obama stressed the importance of continuing education beyond high school. ""You have to understand that completing high school is not the end but the beginning of your life's journey,"" she said. ""It's just the beginning.  In today's world, in order to compete in an ever-globalizing economy, you've got to continue your education after you graduate from high school."" Obama laid out the various resources that students should utilize when exploring post-high school education options, including studying for the SAT's, attending college fairs and visiting campuses. ""I'm giving you some insights that a lot of rich kids all over the country -- they know this stuff, and I want you to know it, too,"" she told the students. ""Because you have got to go and get your education.  You've got to. "" The brief interruption in the first lady's speech occurred about 12 minutes into her remarks. Obama stopped her speech to check if the child who fainted was OK, and then called for paramedics to come to the student's aid. The student was accompanied out of the event by paramedics, but was walking on her own, according to CNN photojournalist David Rust, who attended the event.","Michelle Obama makes her campaign trail debut Monday .

"(CNN) -- The scenes are depressingly familiar. A gunman opens fire on an American campus. Students, teachers and administrators duck for cover. Parents anxiously wait for their kids to check in, praying for the phone to ring. It played out again Tuesday at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, Oregon, a city of 16,400 people 12 miles east of Portland. Jared Padgett, a student at the school, shot and killed another student before taking his own life. The 15-year-old Padgett arrived at school on a bus, carrying a guitar case and a duffel bag, Troutdale Police Chief Scott Anderson told reporters Wednesday. The freshman student had an AR-15 type rifle, a semi-automatic handgun, nine loaded magazines capable of holding several hundred rounds, and a large knife, Anderson said. Authorities have found no link between Padgett and his victim, 14-year-old freshman, Emilio Hoffman, and no known motive. Padgett shot and killed Hoffman in a locker room. He also shot and wounded a teacher. Padgett then moved through a main hallway, where he ducked into a small restroom as officers closed in, Anderson said. There was a brief exchange of gunfire, but, based on autopsy reports, Padgett died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. ""Given the weapons and the amount of ammunition that the shooter was carrying, the early notification and the initial law enforcement response were critical,"" the police chief said. The school shooting, the second in a week, is the latest in a long string. An attack at Seattle Pacific University last week killed one person and wounded two others. Timeline of U.S. school violence . Speaking in Washington, President Barack Obama said the nation should be ashamed of its inability to get tougher gun restrictions through Congress in the aftermath of mass shootings that he said have become commonplace in America. ""Our levels of gun violence are off the charts. There's no advanced, developed country on Earth that would put up with this,"" he said. Heroics by coach . Todd Rispler, a teacher and coach at the school, was praised by police for what they called heroic actions. Witnesses at the school said that after the shooter killed Hoffman, he chased Rispler out of the building while shooting at him. Several students said they saw blood on Rispler's white shirt as he ran. What they didn't see was that the coach ran to the main administrative office, where he alerted the school's leadership about the gunman on the premises. Officials immediately initiated a lockdown on the school. ""Despite being injured, (he) was able to make his way to the office and initiate the school lockdown procedure,"" Anderson said. The news was warmly received by students at the school, who made a celebrity of Rispler by posting about him on social media. ""Everyone on Twitter is talking about how he's a boss and how even if he was shot and injured he'd be fine,"" student Kara Ikebe told CNN. A closer look: How many school shootings since Newtown? The debate . So, what now? Will this latest instance of gun violence compel Congress to act? The President isn't optimistic. Most members of Congress are ""terrified"" of the National Rifle Association, he said Tuesday, adding that nothing will change until public opinion demands it. ""The country has to do some soul-searching about this. This is becoming the norm, and we take it for granted, in ways that, as a parent, are terrifying to me,"" Obama said. There was no immediate response from the NRA. The number of active shooter events -- defined as one or more people whose primary motive is mass murder in a confined or populated area, not including gang and family-related shootings -- has risen somewhat in real numbers in recent years. A report by the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center found that the number of these types of mass shootings has increased from an average of about five a year prior to 2009 to 15 in 2013. Opinion: Gun debate? What gun debate? The focus . The NRA and its supporters have previously said that no number of laws can effectively stop anyone out to kill. ""The violence is in the person, not in the gun,"" Jerry Henry, executive director of GeorgiaCarry.Org, said this year. ""And until you figure out how to treat the violence, then you're going to have that. And taking all the guns off the street is not going to make anybody any safer."" CNN analyst Fareed Zakaria disagrees. ""Every time there is a serious gun massacre in the United States -- and alas, these are fairly common -- the media focuses on the twisted psychology of the shooter and asks why we don't pay more attention to detecting and treating mental illness,"" he wrote. ""The question we should really be focused on is not the specific cause of a single shooting, but why there are so many of them in America."" America's per capita gun homicide rate in 2009 was 12 times higher than the average of Canada, Germany, Australia and Spain. ""Does anyone think that we have 12 times as many psychologically troubled people as they do in these countries?"" It's a point Obama also touched on Tuesday. ""The United States does not have a monopoly on crazy people. It's not the only country that has psychosis,"" he said. Oregon school shooting victim 'didn't deserve what he got' The aftermath . Back at Reynolds High School on Tuesday, anxious parents waited for news that their children were safe as word of the shooting spread. Evacuated students were bused to a local grocery store parking lot and released after clearing a police pat-down for weapons. One couple, Craig Tuholski and Tawnjia Reimer, were talking with CNN affiliate KGW about how agonizing the wait for news was, when Tuholski's cell phone rang. ""Is that Chris?"" Reimer asked before letting out a sigh of relief. ""Oh, thank God."" ""That's what we were waiting for,"" Tuholski said after hanging up. The vigil . Several hundred people turned out Tuesday night for a vigil to honor Hoffman, including his family. Although senior Jaylen Edwards didn't know Emilio Hoffman well, he posted one of the early tweets calling the community to attend. ""At the end of the day, we can come together for a great cause and support Emilio and his family,"" he told affiliate KATU. As candles flickered in the fading light, the heartbroken community sang ""Amazing Grace."" ""We just have to make sure that we all stick together and have each other's backs,"" Edwards said. Special sentence sought for Seattle college shooting suspect . CNN's Jason Hanna, Mariano Castillo, Steve Almasy, Tom Cohen, Evan Perez, Pam Brown, Shimon Prokupecz and Stefan Simon contributed to this report.","The shooter had an AR-15 type rifle, a handgun, loaded magazines, and a large knife .

"Allegations of maggots, excessive bacteria and illegal additives have plagued China's biggest meat products company, Shuanghui International, since at least 2011, according to a series of reports by China's state-run media. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong-headquartered Shuanghui announced its intent to buy U.S.-based Smithfield Foods, the world's largest processor of pork, for nearly $5 billion. In June 2012, a woman in Beijing allegedly found several dead maggots inside a package of Shuanghui sausages bought at a supermarket. Her daughters, who ate the sausages before the discovery, reportedly suffered from vomiting and diarrhea, according to the Global Times, an English-language newspaper under the Chinese-language People's Daily. In May 2012, industrial authorities in China's southern coastal city of Guangzhou reported Shuanghui's cumin-flavored sausages contained ""excessive"" bacteria, which could cause diarrhea, reported the Shanghai Daily. And in March 2011, China Central Television reported a Shuanghui International subsidiary bought pigs that had been fed with meal containing clenbuterol. The illegal additive keeps the animals lean but can kill people if eaten. Shuanghai's chairman later apologized to consumers and announced nearly $2 billion in losses two weeks after the revelations. CNN contacted Shuanghui International for comment on its food safety record. The company directed all questions to its public relations firm which refused to provide any comment, besides a press release. ""All consumers in the United States can continue to enjoy the high quality of safe pork products from Smithfield,"" said Shuanghui in its statement. Still, the Chinese firm's attempts to assure continued quality failed to calm all criticism. ""We know that Chinese food products have been a threat to public health and that Shuanghui was found to have produced and sold tainted pork,"" said U.S. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who held a key role in drafting the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, in a written statement on her professional website. ""This merger (between Shuanghui and Smithfield) may only make it more difficult to protect the food supply. I have deep doubts about whether this merger best serves American consumers and urge federal regulators to put their concerns first."" Major food scandals in China over the past several years have raised concerns both domestically and abroad. In 2008, more than 13,000 children fell ill after drinking melamine-tainted milk. In 2011, Chinese government scientists revealed that 12 million tons of rice had been tainted with toxic metals. In the intervening years, other food safety issues have included fake beef made from fox and rat as well as exploding watermelons injected with growth hormones. ""Indeed, there are many food scandals that took place in China, but I wouldn't make a judgment of the Chinese pork market based on past individual cases,"" said Chinese food expert and Renmin University Professor Zheng Fengtian. ""If (Shuanghui) kept having problems, its business wouldn't have lasted this long."" He added the proposed merger is a win-win situation despite China's food scares and that the United States should avoid actions that slow down the acquisition. In a statement, Shuanghui International promised to maintain the same operation, management and brand of Smithfield after completion of the deal. The company said it will also continue cooperation with the same American producers, food suppliers and farmers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also confirmed to CNN that the ""FSIS (Food Safety and Inspection Service) will continue to regulate Smithfield products regardless of a change in ownership."" China is the world's largest producer and consumer of pork products -- titles it will likely retain if Shuanghui 's acquisition of Smithfield succeeds and if the world's most populous nation continues its love of pork. Between 2002 and 2012, following growing wealth in the country, China's per capita pork consumption jumped by nearly a quarter to 86 pounds of pig products last year. American demand fell 12% over the same time.","China's biggest meat brand, Shuanghui, has tainted food history since 2011 .

"Orbital Sciences, which built the Antares rocket that exploded in a massive fireball Tuesday, described the explosion as a ""catastrophic failure."" It certainly looked like it. Will this failure also be a setback for the burgeoning private space industry? The unmanned rocket was carrying a Cygnus cargo spacecraft loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of equipment for the International Space Station, a floating laboratory that travels at 17,240 miles per hour. It  blew up at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia seconds after launch. Since NASA's space shuttle program was canceled in 2011, the private sector has ferried cargo to the station. Orbital Sciences is one of two private companies hired by NASA to run such missions, and the other is Elon Musk's SpaceX. The botched mission was to be Orbital Sciences' third of eight as part of a $1.9 billion contract with NASA. SpaceX is set to send its fifth mission to the station in December. What happened? While the private sector is not new to such accidents, like the SpaceX test mission that exploded in August, the Antares blast marks the first such NASA-contracted accident since the agency turned to the private sector to ferry space station cargo. NASA-contracted space travel is highly coveted because of the value of the associated contracts, which are in the billions of dollars, leading to a new incarnation of the space race and what many refer to as the privatization of space. Teams investigate failure of unmanned rocket off Virginia . The failed launch is an inferno for Orbital Sciences, and perhaps the public's perception of the private sector's ability to manage these complicated missions will be affected, but it is nothing more than a blip for the aerospace industry. As Musk said in a tweet after the August SpaceX explosion: ""rockets are tricky ..."" Furthermore, NASA recently awarded contracts for manned missions to the station worth $6.8 billion to both SpaceX and Boeing, contracts that are not in jeopardy as a result of this explosion. And about that public perception of the private sector: NASA has always relied on the private industry to help accomplish its space exploration goals. Companies like Boeing and Lockheed have been contracted to design and build every vehicle that has carried astronauts since the start of the space program. In fact, Boeing was the main contractor for building the International Space Station. Opinion: Don't overreact to rocket explosion . So NASA has always relied on private industry, a need that is only increasing as the agency's budget becomes stretched even further and it turns to private enterprise to take on one of the program's crown jewels: manned space flights. And some say the lack of bureaucracy in the private sector will bring financial savings, speed of innovation and efficiency. While the broader industry will remain largely unaffected by Tuesday's accident, no one wins when a rocket explodes. Tweets of condolences to Orbital Sciences from industry insiders flooded social media after the incident. They may be competitors, but they all understand just how complicated these missions are. No one wants to go down in flames. Opinion: Rockets blow up; we move on .","Orbital Sciences built the unmanned Antares rocket that exploded in a fireball Tuesday .
NASA has hired it and SpaceX to shuttle cargo to the International Space Station .
This is the first such accident since NASA turned to the private sector for the cargo missions .
But NASA has always relied on private industry, and the blast isn't likely to change that ."
"The families of passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have been told the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean. Some got the shaking news from a phone call, others received a text message from Malaysia Airlines telling them to ""assume beyond a reasonable doubt"" that their relatives did not survive. Others heard the news in person at hotels in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, around the time Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak made the announcement at a Monday press conference. ""They have told us all lives are lost,"" a missing passenger's relative briefed by the airline in Beijing said. That news gave an official explanation of what happened to the plane, a mystery that captivated global audiences for more than two weeks, but the saga of 370 has produced lingering questions: . 1. How did experts determine where the plane went? Inmarsat is the British company that carried out the satellite analysis that determined the plane went into the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysia's Prime Minister said Monday the plane was last tracked over the water, west of Perth, Australia. There is ""no way"" the plane went north, said Chris McLaughlin, a senior vice president at Inmarsat. The route into the southern Indian Ocean was the ""best fit"" with the signals the plane sent to a communications satellite. But he cautioned to CNN's Wolf Blitzer, ""Nothing is final."" ""We're not Earth observation satellites, we're data satellites. So it will require a lot of different skills, a lot of different people, not least the naked eye, to finally confirm what happened to 370."" McLaughlin said the mathematics-based process used by Inmarsat and Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch was ""groundbreaking."" The new calculations underwent a peer review process with space agency experts and contributions by Boeing, he said. Here are the details of the number crunching used . Learn more about technology used . 2. Has that explanation garnered criticism? On Tuesday, Najib defended the decision to announce the plane was lost over the Indian Ocean, saying it was based on ""the most conclusive information we have."" He told Parliament he didn't want the government to be seen as hiding information on purpose from the families of the missing passengers -- an accusation Malaysian authorities faced earlier in the investigation into the plane's disappearance. More answers will come when the plane's flight data recorder is found, he said. 3. Wait, the flight data recorder has not been found? What about wreckage? Wreckage has not been found. There are a multitude of resources being used to find the flight data recorder and anything connected to the plane. But on Tuesday Australian authorities coordinating the search for the plane in a remote area of the Indian Ocean suspended efforts because of stormy weather. The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet has been a major contributor to the search from the beginning. It has provided ships, aircraft and significant technical know-how. As a precautionary measure in case a debris field is discovered, the fleet is moving a ""black box"" locator into the region -- which would provide a significant advantage in finding the missing aircraft's flight data recorder, according to Cmdr. William J. Marks, spokesman for the 7th Fleet. 4. What could wreckage reveal? Experts say that scorch marks or soot would indicate there was a fire on board, and how pieces of metal were bent or torn could tell investigators how the plane hit the water or whether it broke up in midair. Former Air Force accident investigator Alan Diehl said the wreckage may show signs of a fire or explosion. If recovered, the cockpit could show signs of fire or indicate if the jet's emergency oxygen system was activated. ""Impact damage, certainly at the visible and especially at the microscopic level, looks a lot different than an explosion,"" he said. Former commercial pilot Shawn Pruchnicki said the wreckage would likely reveal whether the plane plunged nose-first into the ocean, if it gradually descended or it disintegrated in the air. ""We're going to be able to tell that by looking at the wreckage and looking at the deformity, now not only (how) it's compressed but how it's torn,"" said Pruchnicki, who teaches aviation safety at Ohio State University. Learn more about what wreckage could show . 5. What are some relatives demanding? In a word: proof. Hundreds of friends and family members of passengers marched Tuesday to the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing to express their anger and frustration. They said they weren't being told the truth by the Malaysian government. ""If you find something: OK, we accept,"" said one relative of a passenger. ""But nothing -- just from the data, just from analysis."" Sarah Bajc, whose partner of two years, Philip Wood, was on the passenger jet, wrote on her Facebook page Tuesday:  ""There is still NO PROOF that the plane 'crashed' and all souls were lost. There is only improved evidence as to the time, approximate location and approximate line of flight as of the last known 'ping.' This is not irrefutable proof. Dead bodies are irrefutable proof. Until we have those, we will keep hoping!!! It was both irresponsible and heartless for the Malaysia government to release this information in the WAY that did it, together with an unproven conclusion."" Bimal Sharma, an Indian man whose sister Chandrika was on the plane, said, ""I suppose I want to see something from the seas. I don't know why I just want to see some debris off the aircraft and the 'black box' to know what exactly happened because there are too many unanswered questions."" Sharma, who has worked for a long time in the Indian merchant navy, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he had ""sailed those oceans several times myself."" 6. Besides relatives, have others been critical of process? Arthur Rosenberg, an aviation attorney, said he was troubled by the different language used by the satellite company and Malaysian officials. ""On the one hand, you have the executive from Inmarsat saying 'most likely' and somehow that got booted up to 'beyond reasonable doubt.' I don't agree with that,"" Rosenberg said. ""I am not convinced that they are certain where this airplane is,"" he said. ""I think they have fine-tuned it to a general area, but to say beyond a reasonable doubt this plane went down where they are saying is a stretch."" Aviation experts also expressed dissatisfaction and frustration with the information. ""We've been waiting for the shoe to drop for more than two weeks now. And what we got was the most tantalizingly unsatisfying thread of a resolution,"" Jeff Wise, a private pilot and aviation writer, told CNN. CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said he wanted to see more information about what was behind Malaysian authorities' announcement. ""There is a saying in science: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,"" he said. ""Show me. Show me the evidence."" 7. Is the search for Flight 370 unusual? Are ocean recoveries complicated? Ultimately, searchers have to go to the bottom of the ocean, starting in a big area and focusing in as evidence is gathered that indicates where the debris might be, said Ian MacDonald, a professor of oceanography at Florida State University. The search will begin by looking at the surface, using listening devices and then sonar and swath mapping techniques to try to locate ""anomalous debris fields, anomalous objects on the bottom and try to zero in based on that,"" he said. Crews could use manned and unmanned vehicles in that next stage of the search. One example of a manned craft is the Jiaolong -- one of the deepest diving research submersibles in the world. The Chinese took it to a depth of more four miles in 2012, MacDonald said, indicating that country's capabilities for deep ocean operations. Chinese citizens made up about two-thirds of the passengers on Malaysia Flight 370. ""I would not be at all surprised to see the Chinese take a very active role in trying to locate this aircraft,"" MacDonald said. 8. Speaking of China, how are officials there reacting? The Chinese government is demanding to know more. ""We called on the Malaysian side to provide further evidence and all the information,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei said at a news briefing Tuesday. 9. Who was on board the flight? Passengers on Flight 370 included engineers, a stunt man, Buddhist pilgrims, vacationers and commuters. They came from at least a dozen nations. Oil painter Memetjan Abdullah was part of a delegation of some 24 artists who were returning to China from the ""Chinese Dream: Red and Green Painting"" art exhibition in Kuala Lumpur.  One of the 35-year-old's works, a painting called ""Outlook,"" is part of National Art Museum of China collection.","Passengers' relatives clamor for proof, saying findings are not enough .

"The campaign trail for two candidates in top-tier Senate races took a detour Thursday to a Capitol Hill committee room for a high-profile hearing on Ebola. The outbreak has become a wild card issue in the midterm elections, and both Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and Colorado Republican Rep. Cory Gardner were eager to question top Obama administration officials about the federal response at a hearing that was carried live on most television networks. Braley is running neck-and-neck for the open Senate seat against GOP state Sen. Joni Ernst, who repeatedly tries to tie him to President Barack Obama and his policies. But Braley used his opening statement to criticize the federal efforts to date, saying, ""the administration did not act fast enough in responding in Texas."" Braley also name-dropped an Iowa company that is working on an Ebola vaccine and pressed Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for information on how quickly the government could help advance the company's research. Like many other GOP Senate candidates, Gardner, who is competing against Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, came out in favor of a travel ban for those flying to and from countries in Africa fighting the Ebola epidemic. He used his time at Thursday's hearing to question Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about his reluctance to put more limits on travel. Federal officials worry that a travel ban would make it harder to track people because they could take circuitous routes to get into the country. ""Their reasons today are basically the same thing as saying that all children with chicken pox stay in school so we know who they are. It simply makes no sense. We must make sure we are protecting the American people by making sure that travel from the affected area is restricted,"" Gardner said. It was clear that members of both parties who traveled back to Washington during a week when Congress wasn't in session wanted to show voters back home they are responding to the crisis and holding federal officials accountable. ""It's become the top issue,"" the No. 3 House Republican leader, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, said about Ebola and the midterm elections, which are just 19 days away. Rob Collins, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told reporters Thursday that concern about Ebola is showing up in his party's internal polling and that GOP candidates are responding to the public's worries about the spread of the disease. ""It think the Republicans have been offering pretty concrete leadership on this issue, including calls for travel bans and such that you're starting to see the Democrats mirror,"" he said. On Thursday, a pair of House Democrats -- Reps. John Barrow of Georgia and Nick Rahall of West Virginia, who are in competitive races -- also publicly called for the administration to enact travel restrictions. Barrow also recommended a 21-day voluntary quarantine for those traveling to the United States from countries affected by Ebola. Louisiana GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy, a physician who is running against Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, didn't return to Washington for the hearing, but he scheduled a conference call with reporters Thursday afternoon. He said that voters are approaching him as he travels around the state, and he slammed Obama's handling of the issue. ""It seems to be part of a broader narrative that that administration lacks leadership, and that the senator whom I'm running against frankly enables the administration and is part of their lack of leadership,"" Cassidy said. Landrieu focused her response to the Ebola outbreak by calling on the federal government to increase airport screenings. ""I urge the administration to expand the current screenings from five to all 20 airports in the United States where tourists, international workers and business leaders from West Africa arrive,"" Landrieu said. ""In addition, it is important to remember, in the face of constant calls for budget cuts, that the investments we make today in our health care system, NIH research and emergency response training at our hospitals can help prevent and quickly contain diseases like Ebola.""","The outbreak of the Ebola disease has become a wild card issue in the midterm elections .

"Transport authorities in New Delhi have cracked down on the car service Uber after a woman accused one of its drivers of raping her. The accused driver arrived at a New Delhi court Monday and was returned into custody for further questioning, police said. The city's transport department announced Monday it was banning Uber services in the Indian capital, saying its investigation revealed the company was violating permit rules. ""They (Uber services) have been banned for the future,"" New Delhi's transport authority secretary Ranjana Deswal told CNN. Deswal said Uber was found to be operating local taxi services in the city, despite only having been granted national permits to ferry passengers between states. ""Their taxis on all-India permit have been ferrying customers point-to-point in Delhi in violation of the rules,"" she said. In an official statement, the transport department said Uber had been ""blacklisted"" from providing services in the future because of the alleged ""horrific crime"" and permit violations. Uber hasn't been officially notified of the ban and continues to operate, Karun Arya, a spokesman for the company, said Tuesday. New Delhi's traffic police said, though, that they would be putting the ban into effect. ""We received the notification just last evening. It will be implemented,"" said Muktesh Chander, the city's special traffic commissioner. Any cab violating any permit rule or the ban can be impounded, he told CNN. Suspect in court . The Uber driver accused of raping his passenger was arrested in Mathura -- about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of New Delhi -- on Sunday, authorities said. The suspect, Shiv Kumar Yadav, arrived at a New Delhi court Monday and was placed into police custody for another three days for further questioning, said Madhur Verma, deputy commissioner of police for North Delhi. Investigators also questioned a senior Uber executive at a New Delhi police station, Verma added. Verma earlier said that when Yadav had registered as an Uber driver, he used his real name but an incorrect address. ""His address and background (were) unverified. He was not having (the mandatory) security badge which is given after police verification,"" Verma said. Yadav was acquitted in a previous rape case in 2012, he said. Uber said in a statement that it ""exclusively partners"" with registered drivers who have been through the commercial licensing process and who have government identification and state-issued permits. Police are requesting more information from Uber as they try to determine ""what due diligence was taken before using this driver,"" Verma said. Alleged assault . The alleged victim is a 26-year-old employee of a finance company in Gurgaon, a New Delhi suburb, he said. After work Friday, she had dinner at a friend's apartment before ordering an Uber car to take her home, Verma said. She dozed off in the automobile, she told police, according to Verma. When she woke up, the driver had parked the car on a ""deserted stretch,"" where he assaulted her, Verma said, citing her complaint. The driver then dropped her off near her home, threatening her with violence if she told anyone what had happened, Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh told parliament Monday. The victim called police at 1:30 a.m. Saturday, less than an hour after the attack. Background checks . Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said his company would work with the local government ""to establish clear background checks currently absent in their commercial transportation licensing programs."" But Verma disputed that assertion, saying that ""background checks are already part of our established practice."" Opinion: Uber, grow up, start by sacking your 'creep' VP . In its statement, Uber called the alleged assault an ""abhorrent crime"" and said it had given police the driver's name, photo, address and vehicle registration, along with details of the trip during which the assault allegedly occurred. ""Our thoughts remain with the victim who has shown tremendous courage under the circumstances,"" the company said. ""We will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement officials in their investigation to bring this crime to justice."" National campaigns . The December 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in New Delhi put the spotlight on sexual assaults in the country of 1.25 billion people. Four of the six men involved in the attack were sentenced to death, and their cases are navigating the appeals process. The crime ignited campaigns to call attention to violent crime targeting women, and since then, rapes have made headlines all over the country, from the districts of Moradabad, Badaun, Bahraich, Kushinagar and Mumbai. In June, three brothers confessed to raping two teenage girls in Uttar Pradesh state. Police said at first that the suspects hanged their victims from a mango tree, but an investigation of their deaths concluded late last month that the girls committed suicide. One of the victim's brothers has said he is skeptical of the investigation's findings. Last week, video emerged of sisters Aarti and Pooja Kumar punching and thrashing three men with a belt while riding a bus in the northern state of Haryana. The sisters accused the men of harassing them and told CNN affiliate IBN they hoped the video of them fighting back would deter other attacks. ""Parents must teach their sons how to behave with women,"" Aarti Kumar, 22, told the station.","Uber says it hasn't been notified of the ban and continues to operate .

"President Barack Obama told U.S. governors attending a luncheon Monday that they are cutting too much funding for education and need to make reforms while continuing to invest in the future of America's students. While acknowledging the tough economic climate for state governments, Obama cited the need to prioritize the long-range significance of a strong education system. ""We've all faced some stark choices over the past several years, but that is no excuse to lose sight of what matters most, and the fact is that too many states are making cuts to education that I believe are simply too big,"" Obama told a White House gathering with the National Governors Association that included some of his harshest Republican critics. ""Nothing more clearly signals what you value as a state than the decisions you make about where to invest,"" Obama said. ""Budgets are about choices, so today I'm calling on all of you: Invest more in education, invest more in our children and in our future."" The luncheon is an annual affair that highlights the constant tension over funding issues between the federal government and states. One table included Republican governors and constant Obama foes Chris Christie of New Jersey, Jan Brewer of Arizona, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Nikki Haley of South Carolina. Obama noted the economic outlook is improving from the early days of his administration, saying, ""our recovery is gaining speed."" However, he warned that a failure to maintain significant government investment in education now would cause economic harm in the future by leaving U.S. workers unable to compete in a global marketplace. ""I realize everybody is dealing with limited resources. Trust me, I know something about dealing with tight budgets,"" Obama said before citing statistics on decreasing numbers of teachers and higher university costs. ""No issue will have a bigger impact on the future performance of our economy than education,"" Obama said, adding that the unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree is roughly half the national average. ""Their incomes are about twice as high as those who only have a high school diploma,"" he added. ""So this is what we should be focused on as a nation.  It is what we should be talking about and debating.  The countries who out-educate us today will out-compete us tomorrow.  That's a simple fact."" Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum called Obama a ""snob"" last week because the president advocates that American students to go to college. Santorum framed the issue as Obama seeking to indoctrinate young Americans in what Santorum called the liberal leanings of a majority of U.S. colleges and universities over a four-year college career. Obama, however, made clear Monday that he was talking about all kinds of higher education, including community colleges and specialized training programs to help young people prepare to enter the modern work force. ""When I speak about higher education, we're not just talking about a four-year degree,"" Obama said. The first step is creating a national expectation that all students graduate high school, ""at a minimum,"" the president said. At the same time, federal and state governments need to do what they can to make college affordable, he added. ""Americans now owe more in student loan debt than they do in credit card debt,"" Obama said, adding that ""state budget cuts have been a major factor in rising tuition costs at state universities."" Insisting that ""all of us have to do more,"" Obama said, ""We can't allow higher education to be a luxury in this country. ""It's an economic imperative that every family in America has to be able to afford and, and frankly I don't think any of this should be a partisan issue,"" he continued to applause. ""All of us should be about giving every American who wants to succeed that chance."" After the meeting, Brewer and fellow Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia said they agreed with Obama's thinking. ""I think that we all realize that everybody's not going to be headed to college, that we have to have ... community colleges and good job training,"" said Brewer, who has repeatedly clashed with Obama on immigration policy. ""We need people that fit in with those kinds of skills that they have. So all of that's really, really important."" McDonnell questioned Santorum's wording when the presidential contender accused Obama of snobbery for advocating higher education. ""I wish he'd said it differently,"" McDonnell said, adding: ""I think what we say is, we want someone to be career ready or college ready. If we haven't done one of those two things for the young people, we've failed you. You don't have access to the American dream."" The bottom line, McDonnell said, is that ""when you look what's going on in other countries -- China, India, the premium they put on higher education -- we've got to do better if we still want to be the global leader we are.""","Some Republican governors agree with Obama's thinking on subject .

"Japan's prime minister Thursday ordered his government to find ""multiple, speedy and sure"" ways to stop the spread of radioactive groundwater around the meltdown-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, including freezing the surrounding ground. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's directive comes two weeks after the Tokyo Electric Power Company admitted that contaminated water was leaching into the Pacific Ocean from the plant, the site of the worst nuclear accident in a quarter-century. ""This is not an issue where we can let TEPCO take complete responsibility,"" Abe said at a meeting at the government's nuclear disaster response headquarters. ""We have to deal with this at a national level."" Abe said he has told Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry to ""provide multiple, speedy and sure solutions to this issue."" TEPCO has proposed setting up a subterranean barrier around the plant by freezing the ground around it, preventing groundwater from leaking into the damaged plant and carrying radioactive particles with it as it seeps out. ""The public has a strong concern over the contaminated water problem, and this is an urgent issue to solve,"" Abe said. ""We will not leave it only to TEPCO, but will lay out firm measures."" That will mean a still-undetermined amount of direct government spending to aid the ailing utility, Yoshihide Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, told reporters. Building a frozen wall around the plant is ""unprecedented,"" he said. ""To build such a wall, the government should take the lead to promote this kind of project,"" Suga said. ""We have to provide the support to do so."" The plan to freeze the ground presents significant technical challenges. It could involve plunging thousands of tubes carrying a powerful coolant liquid deep into the ground surrounding the stricken reactor buildings. The technology has been used before in the construction of tunnels, but never on the massive scale that the Fukushima plant would require. TEPCO, the country's largest utility, has been grappling with water issues ever since the Fukushima Daiichi plant was hit by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated eastern Japan. Scientists who monitor radiation levels offshore have pointed to persistent high readings as evidence of an ongoing leak for more than a year, but the utility did not publicly admit the problem until late July. Vast stands of storage tanks have grown up around the plant as TEPCO tries to manage the hundreds of tons of water involved every day, and the company has built an underground barrier to prevent contaminated groundwater from reaching the sea. But it remains a difficult problem, Masayuki Ono, TEPCO's acting nuclear power chief, said earlier this week. ""It's a present reality that the contaminated water is seeping out to the bay without us being able to control it,"" Ono said. Man who battled Japan's nuclear meltdown dies . TEPCO is also pumping hundreds of tons of water a day into the plant to cool the crippled reactors two and a half years later, though most of that fluid is recycled. The 2011 tsunami swamped the plant, located 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo, and knocked out power to cooling systems for the three reactors that were operating at the time. The result was the second-worst nuclear accident in history, trailing only the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl, in the former Soviet Union. Meltdowns and hydrogen explosions spewed radioactive particles across many of the surrounding towns, complicating an already historic disaster. Though no deaths have been directly attributed to the accident, tens of thousands of people from towns as far as 25 miles away have been displaced by the disaster. Google maps show Fukushima nuclear ghost town . In July, TEPCO disclosed that water from test wells around the reactor buildings showed concentrations of radioactive tritium in one well as high as 500,000 bequerels -- a unit of radioactive intensity -- per liter of water. By comparison, Japan's maximum safe level of radioactivity in drinking water for adults is 300 bequerels per liter. Another reactor byproduct, strontium-90, has been showing up in increasing concentrations as well, said Ken Buesseler, a marine radiochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in the United States. Strontium-90 mimics calcium in the body, seeking out bone in animal life. Fukushima tuna study finds miniscule health risks . Buesseler said the amount of radioactive material leaking from the plant now is a small fraction -- about one ten-thousandth -- of what poured out of the plant in the weeks following the meltdowns. But while TEPCO's admission was not news to scientists, ""What's less clear to me is how much this has changed in the last month,"" he said. ""And I think that's part of the urgency."" Michael Friedlander, a former nuclear plant operator and engineer, told CNN on Tuesday that the current problem may leave TEPCO and the Japanese government with two choices sure to stoke further public anger: ""You can either dump it in the ocean, or you can evaporate it."" ""At the end of the day, collecting 400 tons of water every single day is not a sustainable solution,"" he said. Federal officials allowed the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst American nuclear accident, to let contaminated water evaporate, Friedlander said -- but TMI was nowhere near the scale of the Fukushima disaster. ""We're in uncharted territory here,"" he said. Japan signs deal with Turkey to build nuclear plant .","Prime minister orders ""multiple, speedy and sure"" plans to stop Fukushima leaks .

"At first glance, the sleepy Chinese town of Anren, isn't much to look at unless you're a fan of the giant Buddha heads and vintage water tanks being hawked outside its vintage buildings. And then, around a corner, everything changes. At the far end of a long driveway lies a colossal complex and one single word that has come to define Anren: museums. A decade ago, Anren was like many other ancient towns dotted around the country -- rich in history but largely forgotten. Located just over an hour's drive from Chengdu, the capital of China's southwestern Sichuan province, it traces its origins back to the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD). Due to a lack of industry, Anren would likely have remained a backwater but for local landlord Liu Wencai, whose legacy has driven the town's rebirth as an historic destination. Liu and his family emerged as prominent local residents in the 1930. Cruel tactics . Legend has it that he amassed tremendous wealth through cruel tactics, including forcefully taking lands from farmers and brutalizing local women. By the time he died in 1949 after a period of failing health, he had created an enormous 70,000-square-meter estate. His family and staff also prospered in the 1930s and 40s, enabling them to build 40 connecting mansions in the center of Anren. Liu's estate became the town's first museum in 1958. Each mansion boasts its own unique style, displaying the rank, importance and interests of their owners. A blend of Western and Chinese architectural aesthetics, they also provide insight into the remarkable period between the end of imperial China's last rulers -- the Qing dynasty -- and the formation of the People's Republic. Twenty seven mansions survived the turbulent years of revolution and now make up the heart of Anren old town, mostly in the form of hotels or restaurants. Some have been transformed into galleries or museums dedicated to a variety of subjects, such as film, and are open to visitors. Most, though, lie behind locked doors. The accessible buildings have now become a major attraction for wedding parties and mansion feasts. The weddings feature many obsolete local traditions. Lavish recipes . Chopsticks are thrown in the air -- a gesture once thought to lead to abundant offspring -- and bejeweled swords are hung from sedan chairs for luck. Some couples come just to have their wedding photos taken. Mansion feasts, meanwhile, showcase lavish recipes created by chefs who cooked exclusively for the owners of the Anren's large houses and passed down through generations. A spicy duck feet salad is said to be the invention of one of Liu's wives. Despite its colourful history, Anren didn't evolve as a museum town until Jianchuan Fan, a real estate developer-turned-collector-and-curator, decided to open a private museum here in 2003. Fan had acquired land in Anren through auction and decided that it would be the perfect spot to house his large collection of revolution memorabilia. It transformed the area into the Jianchuan Museum cluster. Opened to the public in 2005, it's still a growing project. Ghost town . There are currently 24 exhibition spaces open, covering 100,000 square meters (1.1 million square feet) and housing more than eight million items including historical artefacts, commissioned artworks and reproduced photographs, themed around the Sino-Japanese war, the Mao-era, Chinese culture and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. When Chengdu's government announced in 2009 that it would invest $820 million to transform Anren into an internationally renowned museum town, its fate was further sealed. Later that year, China's Association of Museums and the National Heritage Board awarded Anren the title of ""China's Museum Town."" Midweeks, this new identity has done little to change Anren's appearance as a ghost town populated only by artefacts. Come Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, however, it's a bustling tourist spot bathed in a sea of visitors. Here are the main attractions: . Jianchuan Museum Cluster . While most sites are ticketed, there are a few installations that are free to view such as the Handprint Square of the veterans of China. Ticketed exhibits follow themes -- there's the War Series, the Red Series, the Earthquake Series and the Folk Series. The vast collections can be a bit overwhelming so it can be worth focusing on the highlights. In the War Series, the Hall of Unyielding Chinese Prisoners of War tells the stories of Chinese POWs through a series of photographs. There are also three floors of artifacts at the Hall of the Core of the Resistance, focusing on individuals in the Sino-Japanese war. The Red Series contains the most distinctive exhibits. A maze of decorative looking glasses adorns the Red Age Badge, Clock and Seal Exhibition Hall of the Red Era Mirror Museum. There are also thousands of unique pieces on display in the Gallery of Porcelain of New China that explore how the aesthetic style of porcelain changed between the 1950s to the 1980s. The Earthquake Series and the Folk Series are smaller. The Wenchuan Earthquake Museum relates harrowing tales from 2008 Sichuan earthquake survivors and their rescuers. The Museum of Shoes for Bound Feet features adult footwear measuring just four inches long. Access to all the museums costs RMB$100 ($16) and tickets are valid for three days. Individual museums costs RMB$20 ($3) to enter. Other ticket options are also available. Liu Family estates . The estates are split into four main areas: the Liu Family Old Manor, Liu Family's Historic Home, Precious Artefacts Gallery and Rent Collection Hall. Liu Family Old Manor is the house where Wencai Liu lived with his close relatives. Highlights include their intricately carved door frames and beds. The Precious Artefacts Gallery is is now home to the items that once sat in the now mostly bare rooms of the Old Manor. Visit to all of the areas on site costs RMB$50 ($8) but there are also separate tickets for individual areas. Anren's Old Mansions . Dominating the center of the old town, along Hong Xing Street, Yu Ming Street, Shu Ren Street and De Ren Lane, are Anren's Old Mansions. Many of these are now restaurants, boutique hotels or cafes with varying appeal to just-visiting tourists. The buildings are still well-preserved and the interiors are often in keeping with the era so it's worth having a peek at some of the architecture and murals on the walls. There are also numerous vintage film posters on the walls in this part of town. The Film Museum is free to enter but tickets to movie showings cost RMB$10 ($1.6). There's about 5,000 old films at the museum, so you never know what you might be watching. Galleries, mostly displaying traditional art, are free to enter.","Anren, in Sichuan Province, has been declared China's ""museum town.""

"Police on Sunday arrested an Uber driver accused of raping a woman in the Indian capital, authorities said. Shiv Kumar Yadav is in custody in Mathura, about 150 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of New Delhi, said Madhur Verma, deputy commissioner of police for North Delhi. Investigators seized the vehicle but weren't immediately able to arrest the suspect, who Verma said was ""running here and there."" When Yadav registered as an Uber driver, he used his real name but an incorrect address, Verma said. ""His address and background (were) unverified. He was not having (the mandatory) security badge which is given after police verification,"" Verma said. Yadhav was acquitted in a previous rape case in 2012, he said. Uber said in a statement that it ""exclusively partners"" with registered drivers who have been through the commercial licensing process and who have government identification and state-issued permits. Police are requesting more information from Uber as they try to determine ""what due-diligence was taken before using this driver,"" Verma said. Yadav was due to appear in court Monday as police seek to keep him in custody for further questioning. The alleged victim is a 26-year-old employee of a finance company in Gurgaon, a New Delhi suburb, he said. After work Friday, she had dinner at a friend's apartment before ordering an Uber car to take her home, Verma said. She dozed off in the automobile, she told police, according to Verma. When she woke up, the driver had parked the car on a ""deserted stretch,"" where he assaulted her, Verma said, citing her complaint. The driver then dropped her off near her home, threatening her with violence if she told anyone what had happened, Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh told parliament on Monday. The victim called police at 1:30 a.m. Saturday, less than an hour after the attack. Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said his company would work with the local government ""to establish clear background checks currently absent in their commercial transportation licensing programs."" But Verma disputed that assertion, saying that ""background checks are already part of our established practice."" In its statement, Uber called the alleged assault an ""abhorrent crime"" and said it had given police the driver's name, photo, address and vehicle registration, along with details of the trip during which the assault allegedly occurred. ""Our thoughts remain with the victim who has shown tremendous courage under the circumstances,"" the company said. ""We will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement officials in their investigation to bring this crime to justice."" The December 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in New Delhi put the spotlight on sexual assaults in the country of 1.25 billion people. Four of the six men involved in the attack were sentenced to death, and their cases are navigating the appeals process. The crime ignited campaigns to call attention to violent crime targeting women, and since then, rapes have made headlines all over the country, from the districts of Moradabad, Badaun, Bahraich, Kushinagar and Mumbai. In June, three brothers confessed to raping two teenage girls in Uttar Pradesh state. Police said at first that the suspects hanged their victims from a mango tree, but an investigation of their deaths concluded late last month that the girls committed suicide. One of the victim's brothers has said he is skeptical of the investigation's findings. Last week, video emerged of sisters Aarti and Pooja Kumar punching and thrashing three men with a belt while riding a bus in the northern state of Haryana. The sisters accused the men of harassing them and told CNN affiliate IBN they hope the video of them fighting back deters other attacks. ""Parents must teach their sons how to behave with women,"" Aarti Kumar, 22, told the station.

"Clearly Jesus was sexy. After all, He is the Son of God. I don't mean to be disrespectful, but as I watched the trailer for the new movie, ""Son of God,"" I found myself gawking at the actor portraying Jesus. Diogo Morgado is one hot dude. His Jesus looks more like Brad Pitt than that nice man with the beard in all those paintings. I'm not the only one gawking at Morgodo's Jesus. He inspired the hashtag, ""#HotJesus"". It went viral on Twitter. The actor told The New York Times he doesn't want his looks to distract from the movie, but, ""If the message of Jesus was love, hope and compassion, and I can bring that to more people by being a more appealing Jesus, I am happy with that."" Clearly we have a new trend. A ""more appealing"" Jesus is not just a better prophet, he's ... sexy. We actually don't know what Jesus looked like. We do know he was a carpenter, so perhaps Jesus was buff. But, I don't think when the Biblical Nathaniel asked, ""Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?"" and Phillip answered, ""Come and see,"" they were talking about Jesus' beautiful face or chiseled abs. Yes, Jesus, as portrayed in countless paintings, has a six-pack. As comedian and author, Greg Behrendt joked, ""I'd like to get ripped ... ripped like Jesus. Jesus was ripped. You've seen the pictures, right? He's ripped! Ripped. He's the son of God. He's not going to be walking around saying I've got back fat today, I'm so puffy."" All joking aside, why must Jesus be sexy? Or ripped? Or even handsome? The Rev. Robert B. Lawton, SJ, a Jesuit priest and former president of Loyola Marymount University, says, ""There is absolutely no indication that Jesus was good-looking and sexy. In fact there is a passage in the prophet Isaiah that is taken as referring to Jesus.  It says this: . ""He had no form or majesty that we should look at him/nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account."" (Isaiah 53. 2-3.) While this might not be conclusive evidence, it's quite possible that Jesus was no Jewish Brad Pitt from Palestine. On the other hand, why wouldn't God create a perfect Son? ""Anything that is sexy is going to attract people. People who might not go to the movie might want to check it out, particularly non-Christians,"" says the Rev. Lisa Jenkins, senior pastor of St. Matthew's Baptist Church in Harlem. ""I don't see a problem with Jesus being attractive given our cultural context,"" she says. ""I don't recall a Jesus who was not appealing to the eye. That's Hollywood."" Jenkins is more concerned about what she considers an inaccurate portrayal of Jesus' ethnicity. The Rev. James Martin, SJ, editor-at-large for America Magazine, and author of the coming book, ""Jesus: A Pilgrimage,"" agrees. ""God did not choose to incarnate himself in Laguna Beach,"" he says. ""He chose to incarnate Himself at a certain place, at a certain time in a certain person.""  And that person was a Palestinian Jew. ""Many people have a hard time with the humanity of Jesus ... the closer He is to human physical  perfection, the easier it is for some to accept Him."" But, Martin says, there is a danger in that too. A physically perfect Jesus makes Him into a God pretending to be man.  When Jesus was both human and divine. ""He was like us in all things, except sin, as the theology goes,"" Martin says. ""That means, He had a body, He got sick, He got tired, He may have sprained an ankle or two. There are passages in the Gospel showing Him falling asleep because He was tired. We tend to airbrush the physical imperfections away."" Those traits make Jesus so much more accessible. So much more ... human. I tried to come up with a living person to compare to Jesus. That, of course, is impossible. The closest I can come, as a Catholic, is Pope Francis. I've grown to revere him. Is it because he's sexy? In a word: No.","A film starring Diogo Morgado as Jesus opens this week .

"(CNN) -- A Spanish grandmother who became an Internet sensation after dubbing herself the ""world's oldest blogger"" has died at 97. Maria Amelia Lopez became an Internet sensation with her riffs on growing old and modern politics. Maria Amelia Lopez, who died Wednesday, began blogging from her home in Galicia two years ago, winning a raft of fans with her eclectic mix of commentary and nostalgia infused with a sharp wit. She was introduced to the Internet when her grandson set up the blog as a gift to mark her 95th birthday. It proved a great escape, Lopez later writing: ""On December 23rd 2006, my grandson gave me a present, this blog when I was 95 years old ... and my life changed ... now, I can communicate and interact with the world."" She wrote and video blogged about her experiences opposing Franco's regime, modern politics -- covering topics ranging from the Basque separatist threat to Iran's nuclear ambitions -- and poignantly discussed what it was like to grow old. Her fame even saw Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero drop in for a chat. Visit Maria Amelia Lopez's blog . In one of her last postings in February she said: ""When I'm on the Internet, I forget about my illness. The distraction is good for you -- being able to communicate with people. It wakes up the brain, and gives you great strength."" Her family left a posthumous post, thanking readers for their support. ""[There were] 880 days when her blog made her happy... the support she needed to enjoy her last days of life,"" they wrote. ""When somebody leaves after 97 years, living with joy from the beginning to the end, we can't be sad. ""Wherever you are, grandmother, you will read these comments, all of them without doubt.

"Saying he had no discretion under state law, a judge sentenced a Jacksonville, Florida, woman to 20 years in prison Friday for firing a warning shot in an effort to scare off her abusive husband. Marissa Alexander unsuccessfully tried to use Florida's controversial ""stand your ground"" law to derail the prosecution, but a jury in March convicted her of aggravated assault after just 12 minutes of deliberation. The case, which was prosecuted by the same state attorney who is handling the Trayvon Martin case, has gained the attention of civil rights leaders who say the African-American woman was persecuted because of her race. After the sentencing, Rep. Corrine Brown confronted State Attorney Angela Corey in the hallway, accusing her of being overzealous, according to video from CNN affiliate WJXT. ""There is no justification for 20 years,"" Brown told Corey during an exchange frequently interrupted by onlookers. ""All the community was asking for was mercy and justice,"" she said. Corey said she had offered Alexander a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three-year prison sentence, but Alexander chose to take the case to a jury trial, where a conviction would carry a mandatory sentence under a Florida law known as ""10-20-life."" The law mandates increased penalties for some felonies, including aggravated assault, in which a gun is carried or used. Corey said the case deserved to be prosecuted because Alexander fired in the direction of a room where two children were standing. Alexander said she was attempting to flee her husband, Rico Gray, on August 1, 2010, when she picked up a handgun and fired a shot into a wall. She said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband, got angry and tried to strangle her. She said she escaped and ran to the garage, intending to drive away. But, she said, she forgot her keys, so she picked up her gun and went back into the house. She said her husband threatened to kill her, so she fired one shot. ""I believe when he threatened to kill me, that's what he was absolutely going to do,"" she said. ""That's what he intended to do. Had I not discharged my weapon at that point, I would not be here."" Alexander's attorneys tried to use the state law that allows people to use potentially deadly force anywhere they feel reasonably threatened with serious harm or death. But a previous judge in the case rejected the request, saying Alexander's decision to go back into the house was not consistent with someone in fear for her safety, according to the Florida Times Union newspaper. A jury convicted Alexander in March and Judge James Daniel denied her request for a new trial in April. Daniel handed down the sentence Friday after an emotional sentencing hearing during which Alexander's parents, 11-year-old daughter and pastor spoke on her behalf. Several people had to be escorted from the courtroom after breaking out singing and chanting about a perceived lack of justice in the case, but Daniel made a point to say that he had no choice under state law. ""Under the state's 10-20-life law, a conviction for aggravated assault where a firearm has been discharged carries a minimum and maximum sentence of 20 years without regarding to any extenuating or mitigating circumstances that may be present, such as those in this case,"" Daniel said. Brown, the Jacksonville congresswoman, told reporters after the sentencing that the case was a product of ""institutional racism."" ""She was overcharged by the prosecutor. Period,"" Brown said. ""She never should have been charged."" Brown has been more complimentary about Corey's work in the Trayvon Martin case, where her office filed second degree murder charges against neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the February 26 death of the unarmed African-American teen-ager. That case provoked nationwide protests demanding Zimmerman's arrest after an initial police investigation released him under the ""stand your ground"" law.","A judge issues a 20-year sentence to woman who fired warning shot inside her house .

"(CNN) -- Rape has turned into a weapon of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the number of attacks on women having grown threefold over the past few years, human rights activists said in October. Anneke van Woudenberg, senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, told Christiane Amanpour that 200,000 women and girls have been raped in Eastern Congo since 1998, and the condition of women has become more dire as the Congolese army has pressed a military campaign against armed groups in the countryside. ""Rape is being used as a weapon of war in eastern Congo. So we notice and we have documented that when armed groups walk into town, they will rape the women and girls, sometimes publicly, sometimes privately, in order to punish the local population,"" she said. ""It's the easiest way to terrorize a community."" Congo has witnessed one of the worst humanitarian crises since World War II, with a death toll estimated at more than 5 million. Most of the dead have come not from direct violence, but the consequences of the fighting: disease and starvation. While the war formally ended six years ago, fighting persists in eastern Congo, and women are paying a high price. ""One of the other sad realities is that the majority of those who are raped are adolescent girls, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds. Their lives are often ruined by this. And I think we've got to take more seriously -- protection of civilians is not just protecting them from death. It's protecting them from rape,"" van Woudenberg said. There have also been reports of members of the Congolese army, particularly high ranking officers, attacking women. In May, the United Nations handed over the names of five top military officers accused of rape. Two of the senior officers are being detained in the capital of Kinshasa and the three others must report to authorities under close observation. They are awaiting trial. Still more must be done, aid groups say, starting with the establishment of a special court made up of Congolese and international judges and prosecutors to investigate rape allegations. ""I think they've got to start holding to account the generals and colonels who are either themselves responsible or who allow their troops to rape. And so far, those are the guys that have been untouchable,"" said van Woudenberg. ""No general has yet been held to account in Congo for rape, and it's high time that that changes."" Congo has taken some measures to try to curb the sexual violence. In 2006, its parliament passed a law criminalizing rape, with penalties ranging from five to 20 years. Penalties are doubled under certain circumstances, including gang-rape and if the perpetrator is a public official. Kabila's wife, Olive Lemba Kabila, has launched a public campaign speaking out against rapes of the nation's women and girls. The army has also started a zero-tolerance campaign in which commanders have emphasized to troops that they must respect human rights and protect civilians from harm, according to the U.N. The United Nations maintains in Congo its largest peacekeeping force anywhere in the world. But the forces have been ineffective at stopping rape. Jean-Marie Guehenno, the former head of U.N. peacekeeping, told Amanpour that the international forces face a serious problem: Too few troops assigned to the vast inaccessible reaches of eastern Congo. ""In the Kivu provinces, there are 10 million people,"" Guehenno said. ""If one applied the counterinsurgency ratios that the U.S. Army thinks of -- say, 20 per 1,000 -- that would mean 200,000 troops in Congo -- 200,000 accountable troops."" ""The U.N. is in a tough spot, to be frank, because if it did not give any support to the Congolese army, probably the Congolese army might prey even more on the population,"" Guehenno said. Part of the problem stems from the tactic applied by the Congolese government to quell previous armed rebellions against Kinshasa by incorporating insurgents into the ranks of the national army, leading to a military that paid scant attention to human rights, and the rights of women in particular. Watch how one community is coping . ""What needs to be done is to have a state in Congo that can control its territory and that has the confidence of the people,"" Guehenno said. ""The violence in the Kivu, the violence in Ituri, it is the result of a vacuum, the fact that there is no administration, there is no credible state, there is no justice. And so that vacuum is being occupied by various militias. ""And, unfortunately, when the Congolese army integrates a militia without sorting between the killers and those who could be integrated, it just adds to the problem."" Van Woudenberg called for international pressure to force the Congolese army to bring abusers to justice. ""My worst fear is that we're going to continue to see those individuals responsible for rape being promoted. My hope is that the women and girls of -- of eastern Congo in particular -- will continue to speak out. I think we've seen immense courage from those women and girls to say, 'No, we've had enough.'""","Human Rights Watch: 200,000 women, girls raped in Eastern Congo since 1998 .

"All eyes and ears were on St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch late Monday when he announced there would be no indictment in the shooting death of Michael Brown. But that wasn't all he talked about. In his nearly 45-minute statement, including questions, McCulloch touched on a variety of topics: the role of the 24-hour news cycle, the relative unreliability of eyewitnesses and the evidence and testimony in the case. Why was decision kept secret for hours? ""I thought of his statement in two parts. The first part was an extended whine and complaint about the news media and social media, which I thought was entirely inappropriate and embarrassing,"" said CNN legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""I did think it was appropriate for him to go through the evidence, but frankly it was hard to follow and I think a lot of us are going to have to go through the evidence itself and see whether his conclusions are justified,"" he said. Decision to announce verdict at night devastating . CNN is combing through that evidence now. In the meantime, here's a rundown of McCulloch's main points: . The media was a problem . The prosecuting attorney blasted the media's constant need for news. ""The most significant challenge encountered in this investigation has been the 24-hour news cycle and its insatiable appetite for something -- for anything -- to talk about, following closely behind with the non-stop rumors on social media,"" McCulloch said. He acknowledged the lack of detail could be frustrating and might make those already distrustful of the system more suspicious. But the secrecy, he said, serves a point. ""Those closely guarded details, especially about the physical evidence, give law enforcement a yardstick for measuring the truthfulness of witnesses,"" said McCulloch. Eyewitness accounts must be challenged . McCulloch spent a fair amount of time talking about the unreliability of some eyewitness statements. Some witnesses, he said, changed their stories. Others were proven wrong by the physical evidence. Darren Wilson, a white officer, fatally shot Brown, an unarmed black teen, on August 9. McCulloch offered the following example to help prove his case. ""Before the results of the private autopsy were released, witnesses on social media, during interviews with the media, and even during questioning by law enforcement claimed that they saw Officer Wilson stand over Michael Brown and fire many rounds into his back. ""Others claimed that Officer Wilson shot Mr. Brown in the back as Mr. Brown was running away. ""However, once the autopsy findings were released showing that Michael Brown had not sustained any wound to the back of his body, no additional witnesses made such a claim and several witnesses adjusted their stories in subsequent statements. Some even admitted that they did not witness the event at all, but merely repeated what they heard,"" the prosecuting attorney said. Read the documents from the grand jury . Physical evidence was key . As opposed to eyewitness accounts, McCulloch stressed the importance and reliability of physical evidence. ""Physical evidence does not change because of public pressure or personal agenda. Physical evidence does not look away as events unfold, nor does it block out or add to memory. Physical evidence remains constant and as such is a solid foundation upon which cases are built,"" he said. Wilson fired 12 rounds . McCulloch told reporters two shots were fired at Wilson's car, where there was an altercation with Brown. Ten more shots were fired east of the car, where the teen had run, he said. ""A nearby tenant, during a video chat, inadvertently captured the final 10 shots on tape. There was a string of several shots, followed by a brief pause, following by another string of several shots,"" said McCulloch. The jurors are the only ones who know the whole story . The prosecuting attorney repeatedly praised the good work of the grand jurors. ""The grand jury worked tirelessly to examine and reexamine all of the testimony of the witnesses and all of the physical evidence. They were extremely engaged in the process, asking questions of every witness, requesting specific witnesses, requesting specific information and asking for certain physical evidence,"" said McCulloch. The jurors listened to more than 70 hours of testimony from about 60 witnesses and reviewed hours upon hours of recordings. They ""poured their hearts and souls into this process ... gave up their lives,"" McCulloch said. ""They accepted and completed this monumental responsibility in a consciousness and expeditious manner,"" he told reporters. ""They are the only people, the only people, who have heard and examined every witness and every piece of evidence."" Brown's death has opened old wounds . McCulloch opened his statement by extending his sympathies to the Brown family. ""I've said in the past, I know, that regardless of the circumstances here, they lost a loved one to violence, and I know that the pain that accompanies such a loss knows no bounds,"" he said. No young man should ever be killed by a police officer, just like no officer should be put in that position, said McCulloch. ""This is a loss of a life and it's a tragic loss, regardless of the circumstances. But it's opened old wounds, and it's given us an opportunity now to address those wounds,"" he said. McCulloch added: ""I don't ever want to be back here, so we have to keep that discussion going and everybody has to stay engaged in it. This is a horrible tragedy, and we don't want to see any repeats."" Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson .","Robert McCulloch made the indictment announcement late Monday night .

"Robert King still remembers well the dimensions of his cell: 6 x 9 x 12 feet. There was a steel bed and a sink that doubled as a toilet where he would also wash clothes. King spent 29 years in solitary confinement in Louisiana. He has been free since 2001, but still has difficulty with geographical orientation. ""I get confused as to where I am, where I should be,"" he said. King joined researchers and legal experts at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Chicago this month to talk about the mental and physical health consequences of solitary confinement. ""The widespread consensus among mental health professionals is that solitary confinement, for the overall majority of mentally ill prisoners, places them at severe risk of additional harm,"" said Craig Haney, director of the program in legal studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The talk was timely. This week, New York state agreed to several changes that would limit the use of solitary confinement for disciplining some groups of inmates, including those under 18 or pregnant women. The agreement stemmed from a class-action lawsuit. The New York State Department of Corrections provided to CNN a statement from its acting commissioner, which read in part: ""These are important reforms that will make the disciplinary practices in New York's prisons more humane, and ultimately, our state's criminal justice system more fair and progressive, while maintaining safety and security."" A department spokesperson said no statement was available on the general use of solitary confinement. A brief history of solitary confinement . There are about 80,000 people being held in some sort of solitary-type confinement in the United States, Haney said. Prisoners in solitary confinement tend to be restricted to cells of 80 square feet, not much larger than a king-size bed, Haney said. Sleeping, eating and defecating all take place inside that space. For exercise, prisoners in solitary confinement often get a short time in a cage rather than an outdoor yard -- perhaps one hour per day. Haney, who has studied prisons and punishment for more than four decades, estimates that about one-third of people in solitary confinement in this country are mentally ill, although some prison systems do not permit mentally ill inmates to be placed in solitary confinement. Solitary confinement was used broadly in the 19th century, but the punishment was then largely abandoned because of the view that ""it was doing more harm than good,"" Haney said. Correctional practice began to reincorporate solitary confinement in the late 1970s and 80s, as prisons began to get overcrowded, Haney said. He believes prison systems turned to solitary confinement as a short-term solution to controlling disruptive or violent behavior, lacking the resources to provide positive incentives or programming. But overcrowding in prisons turned out to be permanent and mostly increased each year. Prison systems continued to struggle over what to do to resolve conflicts or stop violence or disruption in the institutions. They put more prisoners in solitary confinement and left them there for longer periods of time, Haney said. ""I think the cost of solitary confinement is now being critically examined and rethought, and prison systems are beginning to ask themselves whether this is worth it, and whether or not it does not create more harm than good,"" he said. ""Courts are pushing them to consider the inhumanity of the practice, as well."" 'Prison wasn't in me' King noticed six months into his time in solitary confinement that his eyesight significantly worsened -- he thinks because his eyes had become acclimated to such short distances in his cell. Over time, he retrained his eyes so that he would not be so nearsighted, he said. Eye problems are not uncommon in these circumstances. In fact, Jules Lobel, professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, said there is a swath of cataract surgeries at Pelican Bay Prison in California. Lobel represents more than 1,000 prisoners at Pelican Bay in a lawsuit alleging that keeping prisoners in such conditions -- isolated in small, windowless cells with no physical contact or phone calls -- violates the Constitution and international law because it is ""cruel and inhumane."" King, who was freed when his conviction was overturned 13 years ago, said his mental health suffered, too, but he knew others were faring worse and he was determined to not let that happen to himself. ""I was depressed every day I was in prison,"" he said. ""I wanted to get out. I was in prison, convicted for a crime I didn't commit. Of course I was depressed."" Initially, food was served to him on a tray under the door to his cell; sometimes the tray was flung onto the floor with its contents spilled. King said he and other inmates filed a redress and went on hunger strikes until they negotiated that holes would be cut in bars to serve the food in a more sanitary way. He said he and others also filed a lawsuit so that the prison would give them the opportunity for outdoor exercise. King could talk to other prisoners through the walls or by sliding notes. ""What helped me weather the storm was: I was in prison, but prison wasn't in me,"" he said. What it's like . Solitary confinement has been associated with many different physical and psychological ills. ""When isolated prisoners are asked, they point to anger, hatred, bitterness, boredom, stress, loss of the sense of reality, suicidal thoughts, trouble sleeping, impaired concentration, confusion, depression, and hallucinations,"" writes Peter Scharff Smith of the Danish Institute for Human Rights in an essay published by University of Chicago Press. Several studies point to headaches, heart palpitations, increased pulse and oversensitivity to stimuli as symptoms of isolated prisoners, Scharff Smith wrote, as well as dizziness, loss of appetite and weight loss. Most studies on the topic have found depression and anxiety among isolated inmates, Scharff Smith wrote. A study on the New York City jail system published this month in the American Journal of Public Health found that those who had been in solitary confinement at least once had a higher likelihood of self-harm. Haney said identity disorders have also been found among isolated prisoners because of the loss of contact with the social world. ""People have to structure their lives around the absence of other human beings,"" he said. ""They [prisoners in solitary confinement] go for years on end without touching anyone with affection."" Typically people released from solitary confinement don't get much help transitioning out of it, he said. Some systems parole prisoners directly out of their isolated cells. Lobel argued at the AAAS conference that social interaction and sensory stimulation form a basic human need, as supported by science. Research has shown people outside of prison who are socially isolated also have a higher risk of heart attacks, hypertension, concentration and memory problems, he said. ""We're trying to integrate law and science in this,"" he said. Solitary confinement and the brain . There aren't any direct brain-imaging studies of people who are in solitary confinement because of access issues, Huda Akil, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, said at the AAAS conference. But available studies on similar situations suggest significant brain changes could be occurring. Positive experiences, including social interaction, have positive impacts on the brain, such as the activation of molecules called growth factors, which are akin to fertilizers for brain cells, helping them regrow and interact. ""Depriving people of that is physically depriving the brain from its nourishment,"" she said. Without any social interaction, some people hallucinate or become explosive in their emotions, she said. An absence of sunlight and being out of sync with the daily rhythm could produce negative effects by itself, she said. Several studies on shift workers have found associations with various medical conditions. Severe depression has profound impacts on the brain; autopsies have shown that ""the orchestration of brain and activity of genes in their brains is messed up"" in such patients, she said. It's a vicious cycle: You feel bad, that produces stress, stress hurts the brain, and that makes you feel bad, Akil said. Chronic depression and stress have been associated with a shrinking of the hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped brain area critical for memory, spatial recognition and controlling one's emotions, Akil said. Studies have shown that the longer the depression goes untreated, the more the hippocampus shrinks. ""When Robert [King] tells you that he gets disoriented physically, I can tell him that people who are chronically depressed have a shrunken hippocampus, and that that affects your ability to orient in space, in 3D,"" she said. King told CNN after the conference that this brain atrophy could be what is happening to him. ""The brain somehow won't register things, and it won't register exactly where I am,"" he said. The Angola 3 . King was one of three inmates known as the ""Angola 3"" who protested what they said were injustices at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. The three spent decades isolated in cells for 23 hours a day. The other two, Herman Wallace and Albert Woodfox, were convicted in the 1972 killing of a guard at the Angola prison. Wallace died just days after being released from prison in October 2013 at age 71. ""His legacy will endure through a civil lawsuit that he filed jointly with his fellow Angola 3 members, Albert Woodfox and Robert King,"" Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Michigan, said in October. ""That lawsuit seeks to define and abolish long-term solitary confinement as cruel and unusual punishment."" Former 'Angola 3' inmate dies days after release . Woodfox remains in prison, where he has been in solitary confinement for more than 41 years. Amnesty International USA has called for his release. King was convicted in 1973 of killing a fellow inmate, although he believes he was ""being punished for being a member of the Black Panther Party."" He was transferred to Angola weeks after the security guard was killed, but was investigated as a possible conspirator in the slaying. Today, King serves as an adviser to Solitary Watch, an online project devoted to news, firsthand accounts and research and reporting on solitary confinement. He has also campaigned for the release of the other two members of the ""Angola 3."" King writes on his website: ""I may be free from Angola, but Angola will never be free of me.""","About 80,000 people in the U.S. are being held in solitary-type confinement .

"Only in space would 2 million miles be considered a close call. An asteroid with an estimated diameter of three football fields zoomed by Earth late Monday, missing our home by about that distance. It traveled at some 27,000 miles per hour. The asteroid came just about a year after a relatively small asteroid blew up over Russia. The roughly 60-foot space rock plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 early nuclear bombs. The blast left more than 1,500 injured, mostly by glass from shattered windows, and raised concerns about humanity's vulnerability to stray asteroids.

"Days after being dropped from ESPN's ""Monday Night Football,"" Hank Williams Jr. fired back at that network, ""Fox and Friends"" and what he called the ""United Socialist States of America"" in his signature style -- a song bellowing biting lyrics in between guitar licks. ""This country sure as hell has gone down the drain,"" Williams sings in a tune posted Monday on his official website. ""We know what we need. We know who to blame."" In the song, the 62-year-old son of the legendary country singer Hank Williams did not appear to accept any blame for his part in a recent controversy stemming from an appearance last Monday on ""Fox and Friends,"" Fox News' morning show. On the program, he said that the golf outing involving President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, was ""like Hitler playing golf with (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu. OK. Not hardly."" When one of the Fox News' interviewers pointed out that Williams invoked ""one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe ... the president,"" Williams responded: ""That is true, but I'm telling you like it is, you know. That just wasn't a good thing. It just didn't fly."" The next day, the singer offered an explanation, saying, ""My analogy was extreme -- but it was to make a point. ... The thought of the leaders of both parties jukin' and high fiven' on a golf course, while so many families are struggling to get by, simply made me boil over and make a dumb statement, and I am very sorry if it offended anyone."" Then, last Thursday, ESPN announced that it ""decided to part ways"" with Williams. His song ""All My Rowdy Friends"" had been the ""Monday Night Football"" theme on both ABC and ESPN since 1991. No remorse was evident in Williams' latest song, titled ""Keep the Change"" -- an apparent dig at Obama's 2008 campaign promise to bring change to Washington. The singer has criticized Obama in the past, and he supported the 2008 Republican presidential ticket of Sen. John McCain and running mate Gov. Sarah Palin. Williams sang that he'd keep his freedom, guns, money, religion and ""my Christian name,"" among other things. He added that he'd like to ""keep the government out of my business."" The singer said that he had expected to talk about his father's new CD on the ""Fox and Friends"" program, and accused the show of playing ""the gotcha game.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- While saying there are no indications yet of dangerously high radiation levels in the atmosphere, a Japanese government official said Sunday that there is a ""possibility of a meltdown"" at two of the country's nuclear reactors. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters that officials still do not know if there have been meltdowns in the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi's nuclear facility in northeast Japan. But as they attempt to cool down radioactive material and release pressure inside the reactors, he said authorities were working under the presumption that such meltdowns have taken place. ""We do believe that there is a possibility that meltdown has occurred. It is inside the reactor. We can't see. However, we are assuming that a meltdown has occurred,"" he said of the No. 1 reactor. ""And with reactor No. 3, we are also assuming that the possibility of a meltdown as we carry out measures."" A meltdown is a catastrophic failure of the reactor core, with a potential for widespread radiation release. Edano's comments confirmed an earlier report from an official with Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, who had told CNN, ""we see the possibility of a meltdown."" Though Toshihiro Bannai, director of the agency's international affairs office, said engineers have been unable to get close enough to the core to know what's going on, he based his conclusion on the fact that they measured radioactive isotopes in the air Saturday night. ""What we have seen is only the slight indication from a monitoring post of cesium and iodine,"" he said. But Bannai added that he didn't believe a disaster was looming. ""We actually have very good confidence that we will resolve this,"" he said. Edano, too, raised few alarms during his press conference Sunday. He based his optimism in large part on measurements of radiation outside the nuclear plant, conceding fluctuations may occur while stating that levels have generally decreased. ""We are continuing to monitor the radiation, but it is (under) control,"" he said. Edano said that nine people have tested positive for high radiation levels on their skin and clothing, with doctors now trying to determine if they were impacted internally. Medical care, including radiation screening, will be offered to those who are being evacuated from the nuclear zone, the secretary added. The Japanese government was preparing to distribute iodine tablets to residents, the IAEA said. Iodine is commonly recommended to block the uptake by the thyroid gland of radioactive iodine. The problems at the Daiichi plant began Friday, when the 8.9-magnitude quake struck off the eastern shore of Miyagi Prefecture. The quake forced the automatic shutdown of the plant's nuclear reactors and knocked out the main cooling system, according to the country's nuclear agency. A tsunami resulting from the quake then washed over the site, knocking out backup generators that pumped water into the reactor containment unit to keep the nuclear fuel cool. Edano said that there have not been any leaks of radioactive material at either of the affected plants. Authorities deliberately have let out radioactive steam in order to alleviate growing pressure inside both of the affected reactors. Pressure had been mounting inside the reactors as steam built up inside, because water meant to cool the fuel rods was boiling. As of Sunday morning, winds in northeast Japan were blowing out to sea at 5-15 mph, said CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward. But they were expected to reverse direction by Monday night, he said. The Daiichi plant is located about 160 miles (260 kilometers) north of Tokyo. Plant officials are also injecting sea water and boron into the plant in an effort to cool its nuclear fuel and stop any reactions. Boron, a chemical element, was being added to the water ""to sort of stymie other potential nuclear reactions,"" according to Robert Alvarez, senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies and a former senior policy adviser to the U.S. secretary of energy. He described the plan to use salt water as ""an act of desparation"" by Japanese authorities, who seemed unable to deliver fresh water or plain water to cool the reactor and stabilize it. Earlier, Edano had pointed out another potential challenge -- saying, without elaboration, that ""some of the readings in the measurement equipment were not accurate."" The detection of a cesium isotope -- as noted by Bannai -- indicates that the reactors' nuclear fuel cladding has failed, said Ken Bergeron, a physicist and former scientist at Sandia National Laboratories. ""Now we have to hope that the containment building will succeed in preventing major amounts of radioactivity"" from escaping, he said. Fukushima Daiichi facility has such a building -- something that Chernobyl, the Soviet nuclear plant that famously melted down in 1986, did not have. Cesium 137 can remain dangerous for 600 years and is associated with a number of cancers, said Dr. Ira Helfand, a member of the board of Physicians for Social Responsibility. Some experts said the flow of information from the agency has not been fast enough. But IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano defended the Japanese response. ""I know the Japanese authorities are working their hardest to gather the necessary details and ensure safety under difficult and constantly evolving circumstances,"" he said in a statement. If the effort to cool the nuclear fuel inside the reactor fails completely -- a scenario experts who have spoken to CNN say is unlikely -- the resulting release of radiation could cause enormous damage to the plant or release radiation into the atmosphere or water. That could lead to widespread cancer and other health problems, experts say. Authorities have downplayerd such a scenario, insisting the situation appears under control and that radiation levels in the air are dangerous. Still, as what they described as ""a precuation,"" more than 200,000 people who live within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the plant have been ordered to leave the area. A similar evacuation order has been issued for those with 10 kilometers of the Fukashima Daini nuclear facility, a separate plant also in Fukashima prefecture. Even absent this, nuclear materials expert Joseph Cirincione -- president of the U.S.-based Ploughshares Fund, a firm involved in security and peace funding -- ranks this scenario third, behind Chernobyl and the 1979 partial meltdown of a reactor core at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, among history's worst nuclear power crises. Japan is heavily dependent on nuclear power, with 54 plants and another eight slated for construction, said Aileen Mioko Smith of Green Action, an environmental group. All are located in ""very seismic"" areas, she said. While experts acknowledged that Japan's nuclear program is very well respected, physicist Ken Bergeron saying that now ""we're in uncharted territory."" ""The bottom line is that we just don't know what's going to happen in the next couple of days and, frankly, neither do the people who run the system,"" added Dr. Ira Helfand, a member of the board of Physicians for Social Responsibility. What we do know, he added, is that Japan's nuclear facilities are ""way out of whack.""

"(CNN) -- The future of earthquake-ravaged nuclear power plant Fukushima Daiichi is still anyone's guess, but it's already triggered fears of subsequent nuclear disasters elsewhere. As efforts continue to get radiation levels under control in the damaged facilities in Japan, several countries have expressed doubts about their own nuclear programs. And seven in 10 Americans say they're more concerned about a nuclear disaster happening in the United States than they were before, according to a recent USA Today/Gallup poll. Are these fears justified? What are the real risks of nuclear power, both globally and in the United States? And what do we do with all of that nuclear waste? Experts say that while nuclear power has generally proven relatively safe, it is important to question whether nuclear plants everywhere could cope with a two-fold natural disaster combination like the earthquake and tsunami that rocked Japan on March 11. A review of plants in that regard would be worthwhile, said Burton Richter, recipient of the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physics and professor at Stanford University. As Japan moves toward stabilization of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, here are some larger issues to think about in terms of the future of nuclear energy: . Balancing risks and benefits . It makes sense that the public is frightened as workers continue to tame the situation at Fukushima Daiichi; people want to know that nuclear power is safe, Richter said. But so far, although the Fukushima Daiichi site is not in the clear in terms of radiation inside the plant, the radiation levels outside the gate are still not high enough to do any harm to human health. President Barack Obama and numerous health officials have assured U.S. residents that while radioactive particles from Japan may be detected in the U.S., there will be no health consequences from it, as the particles will disperse over the more-than-5,000 miles separating the site from the U.S. West Coast. Point of comparison: Chernobyl, a far larger nuclear disaster that happened in 1986, is closer to New York than Fukushima Daiichi is to Los Angeles, and no health effects were felt in the United States from Chernobyl, either. In the broader picture of nuclear power, if you look at all of the risks to human health involved in energy production from all parts of the process -- the mining, transport, refining, shipping and disposal of waste -- nuclear energy is the second most safe, with wind as the only source that's more benign, Richter said. When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, nuclear power also looks pretty good. Many studies have found that nuclear power's life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions are comparable to wind, hydropower and other renewable energy sources, and far lower than coal and natural gas plants. Depending on the technology, nuclear and hydropower have 50 to 100 times lower greenhouse gas releases than coal, according to the International Atomic Energy Association. But these analyses don't take into account the emissions from the mining and transport of nuclear fuel, said Mark Jacobson of the department of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University. Investment in nuclear power could increase the proliferation of nuclear weapons, Jacobson said. Also, in his view, the risk of a serious malfunction such as at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima Daiichi is not trivial. Ideally, there should be an electricity system drawing from a spectrum of energy sources, with nuclear as one of them, Richter said. All in all, there are costs and benefits that come with all modes of electricity generation. ""The public should be thinking about: Which devil do you want to live with?"" Richter said. The international retreat from nuclear power . We've recently heard from the leaders of several countries rethinking their nuclear programs. While reviewing safety is crucial, some of the response may be an overreaction, and in certain nations an actual pullback from nuclear energy may be impractical, experts say. On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a three-month moratorium on the extension of the operation periods for German nuclear plants. Tuesday, she ordered that seven of the oldest reactors in the country be shut down so that their safety can be assessed. Switzerland also announced the suspension of development of new nuclear power plants. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN's Piers Morgan that he doesn't think Israel will pursue civilian nuclear energy in the coming years. ""The uncertainty of what will happen is the cloud that hangs over the people of Japan, and I think right now, hangs over the world. It certainly caused me to reconsider the projects of building civil nuclear power plants,"" Netanyahu said Wednesday. This pullback from the international community is expected but, in the view of Gary Was, nuclear engineering expert at the University of Michigan, it's a knee-jerk reaction. Some progress may slow in the nuclear power arena as a result of the Japan disaster, but certain countries, including Japan, rely heavily on it, and can't afford to drop it entirely, experts say. ""In a year or two, the public opinion will still be negative, but there are some energy realities that may dictate the future,"" said Najmedin Meshkati, nuclear safety expert at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Before the disaster at Fukushima Daiichi, Japan had 54 operational reactors providing about 27% of the country's power, according to the U.S. Energy Information Association. The relatively low cost of nuclear fuel and reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels has made nuclear power popular in Japan, Meshkati said. By comparison, about 20% of U.S. electricity comes from nuclear power, according to the U.S. Energy Information Association. The decision of sources of power is a country-specific one, but power has to come from somewhere, and dropping nuclear power may force a country to buy additional electricity from another country, said Peter Hosemann, assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. In Hosemann's view, China and India will continue building more and more nuclear facilities because they do not have enough natural resources to generate the power they need otherwise. ""With China, you can't feed 1.2 billion people with windmills or oil or something, not in that country, if you want to have the same living standards as we do here,"" he said. The silver lining of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster is that the Japanese population may demand more scrutiny of the nuclear power industry there, Meshkati said. They may ask for more openness and transparency about where to place nuclear power plants and how to oversee their safety, he said. ""The negative public opinion has some merit,"" Meshkati said. ""People should question the safety of these plants."" Where the fuel goes . Can U.S. nuclear power plants survive earthquakes? The answer is yes -- each one of them is designed to withstand an earthquake, without releasing any radioactive materials at all, up to the maximum projected seismic event at that plant, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group in Washington. But in Meshkati's view, the spent fuel pools at the 65 running nuclear power plant sites in the United States are ""sitting ducks in terms of safety and security hazards."" These are pools of water at least 20-feet deep where used nuclear fool is kept to cool. At Fukushima Daiichi, these have been big problems because the electricity needed to keep them cool was lost, allowing radiation levels to rise, after the earthquake and tsunami. This used fuel could be extremely dangerous in the event of a natural disaster, as evidenced by what happened at Fukushima Daiichi, and could also be targets for terrorist attacks, Meshkati said. The danger is that the pools could catch fire, resulting in large releases of radiation. Even if the U.S. decided to close all of its nuclear reactors tomorrow, there would still be the problem what to do with the spent fuel pools, he said. Used fuel that has been cooled in a spent fuel pool for at least five years can be put into a container called a cask and surrounded with inert gas, providing leak-tight containment, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. There have been no releases of radiation harmful to the public from this cask storage, or contamination, the NRC says. One proposed solution for long-term storage of used fuel is Yucca Mountain in Nevada. President George W. Bush approved Yucca Mountain as the site to store the U.S.'s spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste, but President Barack Obama cancelled work on the project in 2009. Various scientists, politicians and others like the Chicago Tribune are calling for a revival of this project, in which more than $9 billion has already been invested. Whether it's at Yucca or somewhere else, having a central repository of nuclear waste would be a better solution than keeping it at the individual nuclear plant sites, Was said. But that doesn't address the problem of the need to cool the used fuel for five years before moving it anywhere else. Perhaps a more important question is: Could fuel be cooled in a way that doesn't require the pool design? Jacobson, for his part, isn't sure whether it's better to have all that waste centralized or decentralized; it's just a massive problem for future generations, he said. ""I think it just illustrates this massive hole we've gotten ourselves into by developing so much nuclear power at the expense of renewable energy,"" Jacobson said. The bottom line . Transparency and a culture of safety are crucial for the nuclear industry, and there should be more international cooperation to promote these endeavors, Meshkati said. Because radiation travels beyond national borders, it's crucial to have a strong international collaboration. ""A nuclear accident anywhere is a nuclear accident everywhere because of the traveling fallout,"" he said.","Nuclear and hydropower have lower greenhouse gas releases than coal .

"Videos purportedly showing guards abusing prisoners, including one male inmate being raped with a broom handle, have led to arrests and outrage both inside and outside the Eurasian country of Georgia. President Mikheil Saakashvili said Wednesday what occurred at Gldani Number 8 penitentiary in Tbilisi is ""a horrific affront to human rights and human dignity."" Georgia television stations, including TV9, broadcast the videos Tuesday night. The government has not questioned their authenticity. ""The police have already arrested most of those identified as involved in these gross abuses,"" Saakashvili said in a statement. ""Others are on the run but (are) being actively pursued by police."" The faces of those being filmed were obscured. One man cries out while he is being raped with a broom handle. Another video shows an inmate being punched. The country's interior ministry on Tuesday blamed certain prison employees for the degrading treatment. The ministry said a prisoner at the facility offered ""substantial reimbursement"" to employees for their actions and the video recordings. Its statement did not elaborate on the prisoner's motivation. The interior ministry identified that prisoner as Tamaz Tamazashvili, father-in-law of Irlakli Garibashvili, a member of the opposition Georgian Dream party. Garibashvili said Tamazashvili's life was in danger and that he was being held ""hostage"" by the president. Tamazashvili had nothing to do with the taped incidents, Garibashvili said. Georgia's minister of corrections and legal assistance, meanwhile, tendered her resignation. ""During my time in the office I tried my best and did everything possible to ensure the protection of human rights and to bring the corrections system, as much as possible, in conformity with the European standards,"" Khatuna Kalmakhelidze said in a statement.

Imortalized by Peter O'Toole in  the 1962 movie ""Lawrence of Arabia"", fittingly parts of the Hollywood classic were filmed in the area. But long before Hollywood celebrities and tourists descended on this UNESCO World Heritage site, its red sands have, for centuries, been the home of nomadic Bedouin shepherds. With scorching sunshine by day, cold winds at night and little to no water, the Bedouins' desert life has been all about survival. ""Most people believe that the Bedouins are living a romantic life, but in fact, it is a very tough life,"" says Yousef Zreagat, Jordan's tourism expert. Hundreds of thousands of foreigners visit Wadi Rum each year. They hire either a four-wheel drive vehicle or a camel to explore the government-protected desert. Some stay overnight in Bedouin camps, where they can enjoy traditional Bedouin meals. Famed for their hospitality, the Bedouins often invite visitors to their tent homes to share mint tea or cardamom coffee, while sitting by the fire under a starry night sky. Bedouin life in Wadi Rum is increasingly intertwined with the tourism business.  Attayak Zalabia, 45, works as a tour guide and runs a camp for visitors. At his camp site, Zalabia often prepares home-cooked traditional dishes, like zarb, marinated sheep cooked under the desert sand -- the so-called ""sand oven"" -- for his guests. It is prepared fresh, with the meat sourced from Zalabia's own flock of sheep. ""You need to choose younger sheep, or young goats,"" he says. ""The meat is softer than old sheep."" Zalabia's forefathers were among the tribesmen who fought along Lawrence in the 1916-1918  Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. But today's Bedouins are facing a new battle: preserving their culture and identity. Young boys, like Zalabia's son Zeid, prefer playing video games to tending camels and hunting, much to the chagrin of the older generation. But Zalabia insists the 10-year-old should learn the ways of the desert. ""If children grow up in the city, you sometimes find them soft,"" he says. ""And Bedouins like the boys to be strong for the desert.""","Wadi Rum, nicknamed the Grand Canyon of the Middle East, is a Unesco World Heritage site in Jordan .

"It's their fault, President Barack Obama said Monday in blaming Republican inaction on immigration reform for escalating problems including a surge of undocumented children crossing the border from Mexico. At a hastily scheduled Rose Garden appearance, Obama said the top House Republican -- Speaker John Boehner -- told him last week that the chamber's GOP majority will continue blocking a vote on a Senate-passed immigration bill. In response, Obama said he was starting ""a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress."" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder will ""identify additional actions my administration can take within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can,"" the President said. ""If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours,"" he said, adding he expected the recommendations by the end of summer and would act on them without delay. ""The failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, is bad for our economy, is bad for our future,"" Obama said. ""America cannot wait forever for them to act."" Vilify Republicans . Obama's statement sought to vilify Republicans for the failure to get congressional approval for immigration reform, an issue important to his base. ""Pass a bill. Solve a problem. Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done,"" he said, repeating his contention that a bill would win bipartisan approval if Boehner allowed it to come to a vote in the House. The right fate for immigrant kids . Conservative Republicans oppose the Senate plan passed last year with support from both parties support because it includes a pathway to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the United States. They also fear that such a reform measure would bolster already strong Democratic support among Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority. For his part, Boehner said Monday that Republicans don't trust Obama to enforce laws they might pass. ""Until that changes, it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue,"" he said in a statement after Obama spoke. ""The crisis at our southern border reminds us all of the critical importance of fixing our broken immigration system."" ""Sad and disappointing"" He continued, ""It is sad and disappointing that -- faced with this challenge -- President Obama won't work with us, but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems."" Boehner noted that previous executive action by Obama to halt deportations of some undocumented children led to the current border crisis by ""giving false hope to children and their families that if they enter the country illegally they will be allowed to stay."" In his statement, Obama announced he was ordering a shift in security resources to border regions, and he promised the additional action he can take ""without Congress but within his existing authorities to fix as much of our broken immigration system as we can."" The President also sent Congress a letter asking that legislators work with him on providing additional money and leeway to deal with the situation on the southern border. Border influx . On Sunday, an administration official told CNN the money -- which could exceed $2 billion -- would  go to securing appropriate space for the detention of children but also stemming the tide of immigrants. The government hopes to increase its ability to investigate and dismantle smuggling organizations as well as quickly return children and adults to their home countries if they do not qualify for asylum, according to that official. So far, the federal government has struggled to process and accommodate the influx of illegal human traffic but specifically the spike in children. U.S. authorities estimate that between 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the White House is calling an ""immediate humanitarian crisis."" Earlier in June, the White House announced a plan to spend millions in a government-wide response by sending aide to governments in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help with crime and violence prevention. In mid-June, Vice President Joe Biden also spoke with leaders in the three countries as well as Mexico about working together to promote security. Biden's objective was to emphasize that adults arriving with their children in the United States don't meet the requirements for a policy that defers deportation for children brought to the United States before June 15, 2012. Obama also spoke with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto about the issue and has warned families who see the dangerous trip as the best option for their children.","President Obama blames GOP inaction for immigration woes .

"(CNN) -- A German magazine quoted Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki as saying that he backed a proposal by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq within 16 months. Nuri al-Maliki told Der Spiegel that he favors a ""limited"" tenure for coalition troops in Iraq. ""U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months,"" he said in an interview with Der Spiegel that was released Saturday. ""That, we think, would be the right time frame for a withdrawal, with the possibility of slight changes,"" he said. But a spokesman for al-Maliki said his remarks ""were misunderstood, mistranslated and not conveyed accurately."" Government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said the possibility of troop withdrawal was based on the continuance of security improvements, echoing statements that the White House made Friday after a meeting between al-Maliki and U.S. President Bush. In the magazine interview, Al-Maliki said his remarks did not indicate that he was endorsing Obama over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain. ""Who they choose as their president is the Americans' business. But it's the business of Iraqis to say what they want. And that's where the people and the government are in general agreement: The tenure of the coalition troops in Iraq should be limited,"" he said. ""Those who operate on the premise of short time periods in Iraq today are being more realistic,"" al-Maliki said. The interview's publication came one day after the White House said President Bush and al-Maliki had agreed to include a ""general time horizon"" in talks about reducing American combat forces and transferring Iraqi security control across the country. iReport.com: What should the next president know about Iraq? The Bush administration has steadfastly refused to consider a ""timetable"" for withdrawing troops from Iraq. In a statement issued Friday after a conversation between Bush and al-Maliki by closed-circuit television, the White House said that conditions in Iraq would dictate the pace of the negotiations and not ""an arbitrary date for withdrawal."" The two men ""agreed that the goals would be based on continued improving conditions on the ground and not an arbitrary date for withdrawal,"" the White House said. In an interview to air Sunday on ""Late Edition,"" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that ""those goals are being achieved now, as we speak. And so, it's not at all unusual to start to think that there is a horizon out there, in the not too distant future, in which the roles and responsibilities of the U.S. forces are going to change dramatically and those of the Iraqi forces are going to become dominant."" White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said al-Maliki had made it clear that such decisions will be based on continuing positive developments. ""It is our shared view that should the recent security gains continue, we will be able to meet our joint aspirational time horizons,"" he said. The prime minister's remarks emerged as Obama visited Kuwait and Afghanistan before embarking on a tour of the Middle East and Europe to boost his foreign policy credentials. He also plans to visit Iraq. The Democratic candidate says he supports a phased withdrawal of troops, promising to remove all combat brigades from Iraq within 16 months of taking office if he becomes president. McCain does not think American troops should return to the United States until Iraqi forces are capable of maintaining a safe, democratic state. He has been a strong advocate of the 2007 ""surge"" to escalate U.S. troop levels and says troops should stay in Iraq as long as needed. McCain says Obama is wrong for opposing the increased troop presence, and Obama says McCain's judgment is flawed.

"(CNN) -- Fresh white smoke rose again Monday from Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, caused by an explosion at a building tied to the facility's No. 3 reactor. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said that, according to the head of the nuclear facility, the container vessel surrounding the reactor is still intact. Initial reports suggest that radiation levels rose following the explosion late Monday morning, but Edano said he does not believe there has been a massive leak. ""We are now collecting information on the concentration of radiation,"" he said. A wall of the building collapsed due to the blast, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, which showed plumes of smoke above the plant. The secretary said that water continues to be injected into the plant's No. 3 reactor. That fact, and the pressure levels, has led authorities to believe that the reactor itself remains intact. The incident is the latest affecting the Daiichi, the hardest hit of several nuclear plants affected since Friday's 8.9-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Officials said that the explosion was likely caused by a buildup of hydrogen gas, similar to what had happened Saturday at the same nuclear plant's No. 1 reactor. The 600 residents remaining within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the plant, despite an earlier evacuation order, have been ordered to stay indoors, according to Edano. Officials earlier said that they were operating on the presumption that there may be a partial meltdown in the No. 3 and No. 1 nuclear reactors at the Daiichi plant. Authorities have not yet been able to confirm a meltdown, because it is too hot inside the affected reactors to check. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the plant, said in a press release late Sunday that radiation levels outside that plant remain high. Japan's Kyodo newsagency, citing the same company, said that there were measurements of 751 microsieverts and 650 microsieverts of radiation early Monday. Both are above the legal limit, albeit less than one reading recorded Sunday. A microsievert is an internationally recognized unit measuring radiation dosage, with people typically exposed during an entire year to a total of about 1,000 microsieverts. On Sunday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said accumulating hydrogen gas ""may potentially cause an explosion"" in the building housing the No. 3 reactor at the Daiichi plant. At another plant, in Onagawa, authorities early Sunday noted high radiation levels.  The International Atomic Energy Agency said later -- using information from officials in Japan -- levels returned to ""normal"" and found no emissions of radioactivity"" from Onagawa's three reactors. ""The current assumption of the Japanese authorities is that the increased level may have been due to a release of radioactive material from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant"" located 135 kilometers (about 85 miles) north of Onagawa, the agency said. Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency said late Sunday the wind was moving north/northwest -- which could carry airborne radioactive material near the city of Sendai and toward the Onagawa facility. Most experts aren't expecting a reprise of the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown, which killed 32 plant workers and firefighters in the former Soviet Union and at least 4,000 from cancers tied to radioactive material released by the plant. But in some ways -- especially the fact multiple reactors are affected, versus one in Chernobyl -- Japan's crisis is unique. ""This is unprecedented,"" said Stephanie Cooke, the author of ""In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age."" ""You've never had a situation with multiple reactors at risk."" These issues come despite Japan's solid reputation in the nuclear power field. Japan is heavily dependent on the energy source, with 54 plants and eight slated for construction, said Aileen Mioko Smith of Green Action, an environmental group. Daiichi's No. 1 reactor -- the oldest of the six units at the site, according to World Nuclear Association, all of which are boiling-water reactors -- became operational in November 1970. ""Nuclear facilities in Japan ... were built to withstand earthquakes -- but not an 8.9 earthquake,"" said James Walsh, a CNN contributor and research associate at MIT's security studies program. The crisis has stoked fears of a full-on nuclear meltdown, a catastrophic failure of the reactor core that has the potential for widespread release of radiation. High levels of hydrogen, as evidenced at Daiichi, is one sign that a meltdown may be occurring. So, too, is the detection noted of radioactive cesium outside that plant, according to Toshihiro Bannai, an official with Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency. This could be caused by the melting of fuel rods inside the reactor, indicating at least a partial meltdown. Despite such evidence, Noriyuki Shikata, a spokesman for Prime Minister Naoto Kan repeated Edano's assertion that the situation is ""under control"" and said he would not describe what was occurring in the reactors as a ""meltdown."" But Cooke, also editor of Nuclear Intelligence Weekly for the atomic-energy community, said she's not convinced authorities have a full handle on what she called ""this hugely dangerous technology."" ""The more they say they're in control, the more I sense things may be out of control,"" she said. The Daiichi plant has a containment vessel, which theoretically would capture radioactive material if a full meltdown occurs. In the meantime, government and power company officials are working to prevent even such a calamity -- even if it means rendering the Daiichi plant inoperable. Authorities ordered the injection of sea water and boron into the affected reactors, even though salt and boron will corrode the reactor. ""Essentially, they are waving the white flag and saying, 'This plant is done,'"" Walsh said. ""This is a last-ditch mechanism to try to prevent overheating and to prevent a partial or full meltdown."" Edano has said there have been no leaks of radioactive material at any plants. Radioactive steam has been released intentionally to lessen growing pressure in the two Daiichi reactors -- in an amount authorities have described as minimal. Still, on Sunday, Edano said nine people who were evacuated from near the Daiichi plant tested positive for high radiation on skin and clothing. This is in addition to at least three electric company workers who fell ill due to possible exposure, the Tokyo Electric Power Co. said in a statement. Even if there's is no further catastrophe, the nuclear situation -- part of what Prime Minister Kan called the ""toughest and most difficult crisis for Japan"" since the end of World War II -- has clearly made an impact. Cooke said that it may take years to fully assess the damage at the worst-hit reactors, much less to get them working again. And authorities may never definitively determine how much radiation was emitted, or how many got sick because of it. Then there's the short- and long-term impact of Japan's electric grid: Soon after the quake, power was knocked out to 10% of Japan's households. Most of those people now have electricity, though experts say it is highly unlikely the most affected reactors will ever be operational again. Beyond that, the crisis may have a significant impact the nuclear power movement. Walsh noted that while some countries, like China, may go forward in creating new reactors, others planned for South Korea, Turkey and elsewhere may pull back. But assessing the far-reaching implications of the crisis isn't the top priority now. Instead, the focus is more on making sure that the situation does not deteriorate even further and put more lives at risk. If the effort to cool the nuclear fuel inside the reactor fails completely -- a scenario that experts who have spoken to CNN say is unlikely -- the resulting release of radiation could cause enormous damage to the plant and/or release radiation into the atmosphere or water. That could lead to widespread cancer and other health problems, experts say. Authorities have downplayed such a scenario, insisting the situation appears under control and that radiation levels in the air are not dangerous. Still, as what they described as ""a precaution,"" at least 180,000 people who live within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the plant have been ordered to leave. ""The bottom line is that we just don't know what's going to happen in the next couple of days and, frankly, neither do the people who run the system,"" added Dr. Ira Helfand, a member of the board of Physicians for Social Responsibility. CNN's Greg Botelho and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","NEW: A blast occurs Monday at the Daiichi's plant No. 3 reactor building, an official says .

"Few ancient civilizations have left an architectural footprint quite as indelible as the Nabateans did in Petra, southern Jordan. Majestic temples, burial chambers and homes still stand, carved around 2,300 years ago from the rose-hued landscape. Logic would dictate that the relics strewn throughout the 2.8 million square feet of Petra Archaeological Park would provide historians with a bounty of information about the ancient culture. In fact, surprisingly little is known about ancient Nabatean life and traditions. An estimated 85% of the area has never been excavated, and there is precious little in the way of written records. ""I don't think we really understand what significance some of these structures truly had,"" says Megan Perry, an associate professor at East Carolina University's department of anthropology. Recently, a team of archaeoastronomers sought to gain some insight into the function of these ancient structures by measuring their celestial alignments. Their findings, which were published in the Nexus Network Journal, suggests that the Nabateans purposefully built Petra's most sacred structures to align or light-up during celestial phenomena, including the summer and winter solstices and the equinoxes. Juan Antonio Belmonte, the study's leader at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands (IAC), notes that the effect is particularly stunning at Ad Deir, also known as The Monastery -- one of Petra's most visited attractions. ""The lighting is spectacular; the sun setting through the gate perfectly illuminates the sacred areas of the deep interior,"" he says. ""Apart from the beauty of the situation itself, the effect -- which would have been observable only a week or so before and after the winter solstice -- also gives you information about the purpose of the building."" Indeed, there's been much debate in the archeology community over the exact function of Ad Deir. Why was it built? Was it a tomb? A temple? Prior to Belmonte's study, there haven't been any clear answers. ""With such an alignment, it's now clear that it was certainly a temple with an astral religious character,"" says Belmonte. ""This can help us understand the religious beliefs of the Nabateans, and also their way of controlling time. It shows they could monitor the lunar calendar by solar and lunar observation. We're really finding a lot of utility in these kind of measurements,"" he adds. Perry, who was not involved in the study, but who co-heads The Petra North Ridge Project, says that while she finds the findings plausible, she's not entirely convinced by the methodology employed. ""I think the idea that the Nabateans could have done this is actually not that surprising; it sort of goes along with other aspects of their religion, and potentially their understanding of place and space,"" she says. Perry has spent a lot of time studying the layout of monuments in Petra for clues as to whether the city was laid out organically, or -- as Belmonte suggest -- if it was planned. ""The tombs seem to be based on natural topography. Nothing in terms of their layout suggests a tie to any kind of solar orientation. If there was one, they'd all be facing the same way, but they surround the city and face in an infinite number of directions,"" she notes. Belmonte, who measured the alignment of over 30 Nabatean monuments, both in Petra and at other sites throughout Jordan and Israel, says his measurements are too consistent to be a coincidence. ""When you study the alignments, you produce a histogram that has a certain credibility from a statistical point of view. If this is by chance, the probability is very small,"" he says.

"One of the most famous tragedies of the Northwest Passage sea route around the top of North America might have finally been solved. British sailor John Franklin left England with two ships in 1845 in an ill-fated attempt to sail the Northwest Passage. Stuck in the ice of the Canadian Arctic, all 129 crew members perished in 1846. Modern explorers have succeeded where Franklin failed, but Canadians never stopped hoping they would find the lost ships of the Franklin Expedition. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that one of the two ships was found. ""I am delighted to announce that this year's Victoria Strait Expedition has solved one of Canada's greatest mysteries, with the discovery of one of the two ships belonging to the Franklin Expedition lost in 1846,"" he said in a statement. Whether the vessel is Her Majesty's Ship (HMS) Erebus or HMS Terror isn't yet clear, Harper said. ""We do have enough information to confirm its authenticity."" The finding was confirmed on Sunday, September 7, using a Parks Canada remotely-operated underwater vehicle. ""This is truly a historic moment for Canada,"" he said. ""Franklin's ships are an important part of Canadian history given that his expeditions, which took place nearly 200 years ago, laid the foundations of Canada's Arctic sovereignty.""

"A leading senator is urging the Supreme Court to ""do the right thing"" and uphold the constitutionality of the sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats. In a floor speech Monday, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, directly addressed Chief Justice John Roberts, urging him in a sharply partisan tone to keep the law, passed in 2010, in place. ""I trust that he will be a chief justice for all of us and that he has a strong institutional sense of the proper role of the judicial branch,"" said Leahy. ""The conservative activism of recent years has not been good for the court. Given the ideological challenge to the Affordable Care Act and the extensive, supportive precedent, it would be extraordinary for the Supreme Court not to defer to Congress in this matter that so clearly affects interstate commerce."" Analysis: In secret, justices to decide on fate of law . It is unusual for a member of Congress to tell the high court how it should vote on a case during the weeks that the justices are crafting their opinion. Oral arguments were held in late March, and the court has been quietly working behind the scenes. An opinion is expected by late June. The Vermont Democrat attended the three-day oral arguments at the Supreme Court. Leahy offered tepid praise for Robert's leadership but was critical of the chief justice's fellow conservative benchmates. ""I was struck by how little respect some of the justices showed to Congress, and of how dismissive they were of the months of work in hearings and committee actions and debate of amendments and motions and points of order on the Senate and House floors before the measure was enacted."" Leahy was also tough on his GOP colleagues. He pointed out that Republican opponents lost in Congress in 2008, saying that helped lead to passage of the ACA two years later with the strong backing of Obama. ""Now they want conservative activists on the Supreme Court to intervene and turn their policy disagreements into law by reading them into the Constitution. That is wrong."" The chairman gave no direct indication whether he thought the law was in danger of being overturned by the court, which has 5-4 conservative majority. The high court is certain to have no response to the statements of Leahy or any other lawmaker. The court will next be heard on the health care law when a ruling is issued, the timing of which will not be announced in advance.","Sen. Patrick Leahy is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee .

"A priest's flock is crowd-funding $35,000 to restore a renowned Lebanese library, which was set on fire a few weeks ago. Between a quarter and a third of the 85,000 titles in the Maktabat al-Sa'eh (The Pilgrim's Bookshop) in the northern city of Tripoli were destroyed by the fire, according to reports, including a pair of 200-year-old Muslim manuscripts. The 40-year-old antiquarian bookstore and library in the old city souk of the Serail neighborhood is the life's work of Ibrahim Sarrouj, a Greek Orthodox priest. Since the attack by suspected Muslim extremists, hundreds of people have come out in support of Sarrouj, helping with the clean-up, donating books and  setting up an online crowd-funding effort to refurbish the library. At the time of writing, almost $25,000 has been pledged. Sarrouj says it is unexpected but he is thrilled by the way people of all religious backgrounds have joined together to help. ""(It was) a great source of joy for me that the burning of this library brought together Muslims and Christians, and especially clergy and Muslim sheiks,"" he said. Social community support . Sarrouj is a popular figure in Sunni Muslim-majority Tripoli, well-known for preaching in favor of coexistence and religious tolerance. There are significant Christian and Alawite minority populations in the city. Read more: The dangers of being an Arab cartoonist . But the city, which is just 30 kilometers (18 miles)  from the border with Syria, has seen intensified sectarian violence and growing extremism over the past two years, including battles between supporters and opponents of the regime in Lebanon's neighbor to the east. In the days prior to the fire, Sarrouj says he received a threat via text message. It concerned a rumor that a pamphlet insulting the Prophet Mohammed had been found inside one of the library's books. The rumor was later discounted by authorities, according to Sarrouj. According to local reports, around 9.30 p.m. on January 3, a group of men broke into the library and set it ablaze with petrol. Fire services arrived only a few minutes later and doused the flames quickly, saving the majority of the library's precious contents. The day after the fire, Mu'taz Salloum, a 26-year-old filmmaker, together with a few friends decided to organize a sit-in protest and clean-up at the library. They created a Facebook event inviting people to ""Say no! Stop cultural terrorism in our city."" By the afternoon, Salloum estimates that 600 people had gathered at the library. ""The reaction was very positive, it was not expected,"" said Salloum. ""A lot of people from outside Tripoli (came) and I saw friends I hadn't seen for years, that hadn't participated in any civil society demonstration or activity."" That day, as people cleaned and discussed what else they could do, the Kafana Samtan (""Enough Silence"") campaign was born. ""We said, 'We shouldn't stop at only cleaning the library. Why not create a campaign to restore the library and bring it back better than before,"" Salloum added. Volunteers unite . The movement is powered by volunteers without any political or sectarian backing, according to Salloum. Salloum has been working at the library every weekend since the fire and estimates that around 50 volunteers help out each Friday and Saturday. One participant, Hrs Darwich wrote on the Facebook page: ""This city will not kneel to terrorism and bigotry and extremism. Solidarity prevails, I'll be there."" Sarrouj says he has been inundated with telephone calls from all over the world pledging money, and tens of cartons of books are being sent to him from all over Lebanon by publishers, universities and the Lebanese Ministry of Culture. Read more: Qatart gets its first World Heritage site . It's only been a few weeks since the fire and Sarrouj says it remains difficult to fully quantify the damage done. But Kafana Samtan has big plans for the library. All the donated books will be put in a new public area where anyone can spend time reading and researching. If they are successful in crowd-funding $35,000, they will spend it modernizing the library's crumbling interior, installing security equipment and buying back rare books. Salloum says the people of Tripoli have had enough of the violence in their city -- and the library has become a symbol of that. ""Tripoli is the second largest city in Lebanon and deserves a better way of living ... this is going to be a really strong message to those who are behind the burning,"" he said. Sarrouj, for his part, is less concerned with the books and donations. ""What's behind it, the movement of the heart, this is what counts for me ... I hope that with this movement that we can change our Arab world.""","Library and antique bookshop in Tripoli torched in early January .

"""Wow! I totally just watched the awesome cell phone video you shot at that concert!"" Said nobody ever. Yet, at some point, we've all done it. The band is on stage. The phone is in your pocket. And, lest you actually just dance and enjoy yourself and maybe scan the floor for dropped cash, you decide, instead, to shoot three minutes of unlistenable pixel puke. Because you can. Perhaps you upload the blurry mess to Facebook or YouTube, but in the end, it ultimately just gets filed deep within your camera roll with the pointless images of some overpriced, mediocre meal you ate from a trendy new food truck. For, at the time, that, too, seemed worth documenting. ""Look, Sarah! Mexican-Chinese-Ethiopian-Pittsburgh fusion!"" It's difficult to explain just why we do it -- why having a very basic camera in our pocket compels us to shoot photos and videos of live music that, deep down, we know we'll never look at. Part of it might be the delusional notion of preserving a memory, but it's probably more about showing everyone in social media that you're actually out of your house doing something culturally important. As opposed to staying in and slathering your body with ranch dressing. Once again, I believe I've shared too much. But for exploring your city and having a true, cultural experience, live music counts. Going to Home Depot doesn't. Otherwise, we'd all be tweeting arrogant selfies next to lumber. ""Must be nice to be Gary. Always hanging around wood."" Of course, cell phones annoyingly blocking your view at concerts is nothing new, and even complaining about them (like I am here) has grown rather cliché. Yet, it seems to be getting worse. So, recently, the indie rock band the Yeah Yeah Yeahs decided to try something. They posted a sign: . ""PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THE SHOW THROUGH A SCREEN ON YOUR SMART DEVICE/CAMERA. PUT THAT S--- AWAY as a courtesy to the person behind you and to Nick, Karen and Brian. MUCH LOVE AND MANY THANKS! YEAH YEAH YEAHS"" This all came out a couple of weeks ago when a picture of their sign from New York's Webster Hall was tweeted by Spin magazine, and it quickly got passed around the Internet. The band's sentiments seemed to strike a nerve. But never mind the annoyance of having to look at the stage through a sea of bright, glaring viewfinders. Even more than that, it's all just become sort of sad. We're disconnected from the music. The real eye-opener for me was last year, when I saw Roger Waters perform ""The Wall."" It was incredible. This show had explosions. And shiny things. And planes falling from the sky. It was complete sensory overload, and when I got home, I decided my life needed more lasers. I considered attaching some to my dog. In fact, I'm still thinking about it. ""The Wall"" was simply amazing. Yet, so many people missed the entire show. And they were literally right there. Amidst all the operatic madness of the classic Pink Floyd double album, everywhere I looked, people were watching it through 3 inches of glass on their phones. One of the greatest rock spectacles ever was directly in front of them, yet they actually made the conscious decision to have a worse visual experience. If ""The Wall"" was fine dining, it would be like ordering a beautiful steak and then asking the server to put it down his pants for five minutes. ""Look, just run around the building a few times, do some burpees and bring it back."" But, for all those people at the Roger Waters show, I guess it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time. However, I assure you it wasn't. So, as an experiment, I want you to pick up your phone, scroll through your photos and videos, and stop when you get to something you shot at a concert. Then ask yourself this: Did I actually pay to see Creed? And if the answer is yes, go jump into a river. Otherwise, take a moment and really think about that photo. Or that video. Was it worth annoying everyone else behind you? Has it made your life better? Will you ever look at it again? If you've answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, please join the Creed fans somewhere downstream. Your services are no longer needed. Interestingly, though, on a positive note, last weekend I went to Wanee Festival in Live Oak, Florida, for a weekend of Allman Brothers and Widespread Panic and several other bands that rule your face. Deep within the trees among the masses of people, getting a cell phone signal strong enough to utilize the interwebs was next to impossible. Which may explain why I saw so few people actually using their phones to begin with. And as the night sky darkened, I was struck by the absence of little glowing viewfinders. People were just enjoying the music. Part of that is a reflection of the overall music-first vibe at Wanee Festival, But it still proves that it's entirely possible to be a part of the live music experience without having to document it in some way. Of course, if you have a quality camera and can get up close, there's definitely an art in concert photography. And people certainly appreciate that. But for everyone else, let's all agree to give it a rest. Do it for you. Just experience the music, take it in, and we'll talk about our favorite moments over late-night food. I know a great place for Mexican-Chinese-Ethiopian-Pittsburgh fusion.","Indie band Yeah Yeah Yeahs asked fans to not use mobile devices .

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI has launched an investigation into Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. after a report that employees or associates may have attempted to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of September 11 survivors, victims and their families, a federal law enforcement source told CNN Thursday. ""We are aware of the allegations and are looking into them,"" said the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the investigation. ""We'll be looking at anyone acting for or on behalf of News Corp., from the top down to janitors,"" to gather information and determine whether any laws may have been broken. Because the investigation just began, it's too early to say when the first interviews will be conducted, the source said, adding the probe is a ""high priority."" New York Rep. Peter T. King, a Republican, earlier this week asked FBI Director Robert Mueller to investigate the possibility that journalists working for Murdoch may have tapped into the phones of 9/11 victims and relatives. News Corp. said Thursday it had no comment on the FBI investigation or the possibility of congressional hearings. Meanwhile, News Corp. boss Rupert Murdoch said in an interview late Thursday with the Wall Street Journal newspaper -- one of News Corp.'s own publications -- that he felt the company had handled the crisis ""extremely well in every way possible."" He told the newspaper he had decided to appear before British politicians next Tuesday, after initially declining to attend the hearing, because he wanted to address ""some of the things that have been said in Parliament, some of which are total lies. We think it's important to absolutely establish our integrity in the eyes of the public... I felt it's best just to be as transparent as possible."" Concerns over the hacking of phones belonging to 9/11 victims and relatives appear to be traceable to a story published Wednesday by the Mirror, a British tabloid that includes a section it describes as ""gossip gone toxic."" The newspaper cited ""a source"" who referred to a former police officer who now works as a private investigator. ""The investigator is used by a lot of journalists in America and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims' private phone data,"" the source reportedly told the newspaper. The source told the Mirror the request came from News of the World, the newspaper at the center of the phone-hacking scandal in Britain. ""He said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their relatives,"" the newspaper said. ""His presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the relevant voice mails, just like has been shown they have done in the UK. The PI said he had to turn the job down. He knew how insensitive such research would be, and how bad it would look. ""The investigator said the journalists seemed particularly interested in getting the phone records belonging to the British victims of the attacks."" Relatives of the victims of the terrorist attacks expressed outrage over the possibility they may have been hacking victims. What they went through is ""heartfelt stuff, and it shouldn't be out there for all to see unless the family approves,"" said Jim Riches, a retired New York Fire Department deputy chief who lost a son in the attacks. ""Until we get some accountability, they're just going to keep doing it,"" Riches said. ""It's completely unethical, unprofessional and basically criminal."" Sally Regenhard, who also lost a son in the attacks, called it ""very horrifying that privacy and personal security could be violated in such an egregious manner."" ""I would hold these people accountable and responsible,"" she told CNN Thursday. ""Someone has to defend the dead."" Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey said the September 11 families have ""suffered enough"" and deserve answers. Pressure mounted for a federal investigation into Murdoch's media empire as a key member of a House oversight committee called for Congress to look into the allegation that one of his U.S.-based companies may have broken anti-bribery and other laws. Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, told CNN that ""Congress has important oversight responsibilities"" in responding to the charges and ""getting to the bottom of this evolving scandal."" ""My number one priority is to protect U.S. citizens from violation of the law,"" he said. News of the World, a 168-year-old British newspaper owned by Murdoch, folded over the weekend in the wake of accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities. Police in the United Kingdom have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking. There also were allegations that reporters may have bribed law enforcement officers. On Wednesday, several senators sent letters to Attorney General Eric Holder asking him to look into concerns that News Corp. violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The law, enacted in 1977, makes it illegal for a U.S. person or company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business. Potential liability flows from journalists at News of the World to its parent, News International, and to its parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States. Rupert's News Corp. -- the parent company of Fox News -- may have engaged in ""political espionage or personal espionage,"" Braley said. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, told CNN earlier this week he may start his own investigation. ""My bet is we'll find some criminal stuff,"" Rockefeller said. ""This is going to be a huge issue."" In an interview published Thursday by the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corp., Rupert Murdoch said the company would establish its own independent committee ""to investigate every charge of improper conduct."" Murdoch said the committee, to be led by a ""distinguished non-employee,"" also will draw up a ""protocol for behavior"" for the company's new reporters. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, told ""John King USA"" that he wrote a letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron, asking that the British government share information from its investigation about any possible phone tapping of U.S. citizens. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Carol Cratty and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: Rupert Murdoch says News Corp. has handled the crisis ""extremely well""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's government will offer transportation and other assistance to those in a buffer zone around the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, a top official said Friday, noting these people have been put in a ""difficult"" situation. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said authorities are encouraging people living between 20 and 30 kilometers (12.5 and 19 miles) from the plant to leave the area voluntarily because of the challenges they ""have faced in their daily lives."" Those who live closer already have been ordered to evacuate because of dangerously high levels of radiation. A primary challenge for that region, he said, has had to do with commerce -- namely, the difficulty in getting needed materials in and out of the area. This is not a mandatory evacuation, Edano said. Still, he said, he could not rule out future mandatory evacuations if radiation rises to unsafe levels. Other nations, including the United States and England, have urged their citizens to stay 80 kilometers (50 miles) or more away from the embattled power plant over radiation concerns. Japan has urged those within a 20-kilometer radius to evacuate and those within 30 kilometers to try and stay indoors. Still, even those well outside the plant area are being affected by the radioactive emissions. Traces of radioactive iodine tied to the plant have been detected as far away as Sweden and the United States. Authorities have said those levels are far below what's considered harmful to humans. Two Japanese citizens -- one from Nagano and the other from Saitama, both 200 kilometers or further from Fukushima -- traveling to China were taken to a hospital after showing exceedingly high levels of radiation, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. A spokesman for Japan's embassy in China said Friday that the two are ""fine"" having left the hospital and joined their tour group. ""Abnormal radiation"" was also detected earlier on a Japanese ship, Xinhua said. But in Japan, radioactive materials detected in water, food and elsewhere have had a major impact. The number of banned food items is growing regularly, and has affected not only consumers, but farmers who rely on the products to make a living. One chief concern is the presence of radioactive substances in tap water. Four sites in Ibaraki Prefecture showed radiation levels above what is considered safe for babies to drink, according to government data released Friday. The affected facilities provide water for residents in the cities of Tokaimura and Hitachi. The results, from samples taken on Thursday, showed between a low of 119 becquerels of radioactive iodine per kilogram of water to a high of 230 becquerels of the same radioactive substance. Anything higher than that 100 becquerels is considered unsafe for infants under 1 year old, though the levels remain under the 300 becquerel threshold for adults. Tokyo's waterworks bureau reported Friday, based on tests conducted that morning, that there were 51 becquerels of radioactive iodine per kilogram of tap water. The previous day, Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara lifted the previously announced recommendation that babies not drink tap water after tests from Tuesday night showed levels of radiation more than twice the limit for babies. There was also positive news in the Chiba Prefecture Friday, where all five water treatment facilities had levels of radioactive iodine less than 100 becquerels per kilogram of tap water. The previous day, two plants in Chiba had reported high levels. The fate of Japan's fishing industry is also a hot topic, given fears that spreading radiation might poison fish or scare off customers. The Tokyo Electric Power Co., which operates the Fukushima Daiichi plant, said its latest readings from Thursday morning show levels of radioactive iodine 104 times higher than normal in the waters 330 meters off the facility's Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 reactors. ""I don't know when this will end,"" said Seiji Nakzato, 75, a fisherman from Tokyo. ""Business is down. People don't want to buy fish because they're afraid of radiation."" Still, this is marked progress compared to the previous day's reading, when levels were 147 times higher than normal. The latest results also showed levels of the radioactive iodine were 28 times normal some 10 kilometers south of the plant and 13 times higher about 16 kilometers away. Agriculture in Japan has also been threatened in this crisis, with tests showing radioactive materials at levels exceeding legal limits in 12 types of vegetables grown near the nuclear plant, according to the nation's health ministry. Prime Minister Naoto Kan has also asked Ibaraki Prefecture to suspend shipments of raw milk and parsley, according to Edano. The government of Fukushima Prefecture has asked residents not to eat leafy vegetables. And on Friday, a Chinese government agency posted on its website that it had banned dairy products, vegetables, fruits and acquatic animals and products from the Japanese prefectures of Fukushima, Tochigi, Gunma, Ibaraki and Chiba. They join several other countries, including the United States, in prohibiting the import of certain food products from Japan. Radiation levels in the food would not cause health problems right away, Edano said, but if they rise, they may reach levels risky to human health. The decision to prohibit produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast Japan hit by the earthquake and tsunami. Fukushima Prefecture ranks among Japan's top producers of fruits, vegetables and rice. Ibaraki Prefecture, south of Fukushima, supplies Tokyo with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables, and is the third-largest pork producer in the nation.","NEW: Two Japanese hospitalized in China due to radiation are ""fine,"" a spokesman says .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The half brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai was shot dead at his home in Kandahar on Tuesday, authorities said. Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Kandahar provincial council chief, was killed during a gathering, said Tooryalai Wesa, provincial governor. He did not know a motive. While the governor initially said a friend killed Karzai, his spokesman later clarified that the death was at the hands of a guard. Saidkhan Khakrezwal, a member of the Kandahar provincial council, told CNN he and others were with Ahmed Wali Karzai when a guard named Sardar Mohammad came into the room and asked to talk to him. The guard then ""takes Wali to another room and shoots him with a pistol that he had in his hand,"" Khakrezwal said. The shooter was shot dead by other guards. Sardar Mohammad was a trusted man who had worked as a guard for Karzai for eight years, Khakrezwal said. He was also a commander for a police post where there were about 30 policemen. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying that the guard accused of shooting him was working for them. Karzai suffered bullet wounds to his head and chest, said Mohammad Dawood Farhad, the head of Kandahar Hospital. ""My brother Ahmad Wali Karzai was killed today,"" said the Afghan president in a previously scheduled news conference with visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy. ""The Afghanistan people have suffered a lot. Every Afghan family has suffered. I hope one day these sufferings end."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama comdemned Karzai's murder and extended thoughts and prayers to his family. ""The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the murder of President Karzai's half brother in Kandahar,"" Carney said. ""There's been some claims and we will certainly work with the Afghan authorities on that, but right now the moment here is a personal one and we express our condolences."" Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan said ISAF will help the Afghan government ""bring justice"" to those involved in the killing. ""President Karzai is working to create a stronger, more secure Afghanistan, and for such a tragic event to happen to someone within his own family is unfathomable,"" Petraeus said. Ahmed Wali Karzai, who has been dogged by drug dealing and corruption accusations, had been the subject of WikiLeaks cables leaked last year. Without being prompted, he discussed the accusations with a senior U.S. diplomat, according to one of the cables. He said that the claims are part of a campaign to discredit him and offered suggestions on how to stop drug dealing. ""He is willing to take a polygraph anytime, anywhere to prove his innocence,"" the cable said. ""He suggested that the coalition pay mullahs to preach against heroin, which would reduce demand for poppy cultivation."" A U.S. official who authored another cable wrote that even though he must be engaged as head of Kandahar's provincial council, ""he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker."" He said Karzai's ""reputation for shady dealings"" should be considered when he recommends ""costly infrastructure projects. The official said dealing with people like Ahmed Wali Karzai represents a major challenge in Afghanistan: Fighting corruption and building support for government when government officials are corrupt themselves. Karzai ""appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities, and that the coalition views many of his activities as malign, particularly relating to his influence over the police,"" the author of the first cable said. In addition to discussions of war, drugs and Afghan politics, a comment in one of the cables also addressed his days as a restaurant owner close to Chicago's Wrigley Field, the iconic baseball stadium. ""His restaurant was a hub for American(s) in the Midwest who had worked or lived in Afghanistan prior to the Soviet invasion,"" the cable read. CNN's Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.","NEW: White House condemns ""in the strongest possible terms"" the killing .

"(CNN) -- Actor John Boyega has four words for anyone who's upset he's playing what appears to be a black Stormtrooper in the latest ""Star Wars"" film: ""Get used to it."" The 22-year-old British actor posted the message on Instagram yesterday after his appearance in the new trailer for ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" aroused feverish discussion on social media. On YouTube, some questioned whether a black Stormtrooper made sense, while others reacted with racist remarks. READ MORE: Who is John Boyega? Supporters responded on Twitter with the hashtag #BlackStormtrooper.

""Love how there's ""controversy"" over a #BlackStormtrooper. Even in a galaxy far far away black people exist and can be dynamic characters too,"" tweeted Joseph Oteng. ""#BlackStormTrooper better not die first, or I am going to be pissed,"" quipped USC professor Robert Hernandez. Race in the 'Star Wars' universe . Despite the diversity of human and nonhuman characters mingling together in the fictional Star Wars universe, there have been just a handful of prominent black characters. Samuel L. Jackson played Jedi Master Mace Windu in three films, while Billy Dee Williams played Cloud City administrator turned Rebel General Lando Calrissian in two films. James Earl Jones also provided the legendary voice for Darth Vader, but the actor under the mask was white. In the ""Star Wars"" series Stormtroopers were originally clones of Jango Fett, an ethnic ""Mandalorian"" played by New Zealand-born actor Temuera Derek Morrison, of partial Maori descent. Later in the storyline, when Boyega's ""black Stormtrooper"" character would've lived, Stormtroopers were recruited from general populations -- making a Stormtrooper of any race certainly feasible. As fans continue to dissect the trailer, many have also pointed out Boyega may not even be a Stormtrooper -- he could be a rebel in a Stormtrooper uniform, like Han Solo and Luke Skywalker in ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope."" Fans will have to wait a bit longer to find out more about Boyega's character. READ MORE: The Force is with the new 'Star Wars' trailer . The movie, the seventh in the Star Wars film series, is scheduled for release on December 18, 2015. Boyega's message also contained a note of gratitude to his fans.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Government forces pounded rebel-held cities and crowds ransacked empty embassies in Tripoli on Sunday after Libyan authorities reported a NATO airstrike killed one of longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi's sons and three of his grandchildren. The U.S. Embassy was attacked by what one U.S. official called an ""organized mob,"" along with the British, French, Italian and Qatari embassies, British and Italian officials told CNN. Meanwhile, pro-Gadhafi forces stepped up their shelling of rebel positions in Misrata after Libya's government reported the deaths. ""It's going to be like revenge,"" one eyewitness in the embattled coastal city of Misrata said. The eyewitness reported significant damage and some casualties in Misrata, the country's third-largest city. The city remains in rebel hands, with no forces aligned with Gadhafi remaining in the city itself, he said. Another witness, who agreed to be identified only as Mohammed, said ""very heavy shelling"" targeted the coastal city's port. ""I have been here during all days of the conflict,"" he told CNN. ""Last night was the worst."" And a third man, who wanted to be identified only as Abdsalam, said the port was heavily bombarded. Electricity is out in nearly the entire city, and food and fresh water are running scarce, he said. ""They are using every every possible type of weapon,"" he said. The Libyan government said Sunday that Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Arab Gadhafi, and three grandchildren died in the strike that destroyed the son's home in Tripoli. The Libyan government identified the children as Saif al-Arab's sons Gartaj Hannibal Muammar al-Gadhafi, age 3, and 2-year-old Saif Mohammad al-Gadhafi, as well as Mastoura Hamid Abuzitaia, the daughter of the leader's daughter Aysha. State TV aired video of two bodies, wrapped in white shrouds and draped with flags, one of which was reported to be the body of Gadhafi's son. A funeral procession and burial for the fallen ""martyrs"" will be held on Monday, state TV said. The Libyan leader and his wife were in the house when it was targeted, but they are in good health, government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told journalists. The building was in a residential area of Tripoli that houses several embassies. Ibrahim called the bombing a ""war crime."" The strike destroyed the two-bedroom, single-story house, leaving a massive crater in its place. CNN could not independently confirm the reports, and NATO said in a statement Sunday that the alliance was ""aware of unconfirmed media reports that some of Gadhafi's family members may have been killed."" ""We regret all loss of life, especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict,"" said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, commander of NATO's military operations. However, Bouchard said, all targets ""are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the Gadhafi regime's systemic attacks on the Libyan population ... We do not target individuals."" But U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a leading supporter of the Libya campaign, called the elder Gadhafi a ""murderer"" and ""a legitimate military target."" ""He's not the legitimate leader of Libya, and the way to get this to end is to go after the people around him and his support system,"" Graham told ""Fox News Sunday."" The South Carolina Republican is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In Benghazi, a hub for rebel forces and their transitional government, the news triggered celebratory gunfire even as a rebel spokesman dismissed the reported death as ""a desperate attempt to get sympathy."" ""In all honesty, we never heard of Saif al-Arab until the start of the uprising,"" said Hafiz Ghoga, deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council in Benghazi, on Sunday. ""We don't believe this is true ... This regime constantly lies and keeps lying,"" he added. Opposition members, citing witness reports, also warned that pro-Gadhafi troops in the town of Zintan, 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Misrata, and other nearby areas have been equipped with gas masks. The opposition figures say that suggests the government forces are preparing to use chemical weapons against rebel forces -- but the accounts lacked detail, and CNN could not independently confirm the reports. Ibrahim dismissed the allegations as ""all lies."" ""Every time they come with a lie, they jump out to the next lie,"" he said. ""The media cannot report from one side of reports. It is the same lie when they said we are using cluster bombs."" Human Rights Watch reported in mid-April that pro-Gadhafi troops were firing cluster munitions into Misrata and displayed a portion of a Spanish-made mortar shell that releases 21 smaller bombs across a wide area. The Libyan government denies the allegation. Fighting also intensified Sunday near the rebel-held Djerba border crossing into Tunisia, witnesses and Tunisia's state news agency reported. The TAP news agency said the flow of refugees out of Libya had slowed, possibly as a result. NATO began bombarding Libya on March 19, after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule. The alliance said it targeted a ""command-and-control building"" in Tripoli on Saturday, as well as hit seven ammunition depots around the capital. According to a NATO military official, the airstrike that Libya says killed Gadhafi's son involved four precision-targeted bombs, one of which failed to detonate. The official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the alliance was certain the target was a command-and-control facility and said the building hit, although above ground, had reinforced portions. The official said NATO had ""no evidence"" that Gadhafi's relatives had been killed. A photograph of the site showed the unexploded bomb, a 2,000-pound weapon designed to penetrate reinforced concrete, but NATO would not confirm what other types of ordnance may have been dropped. Nor would it disclose which nation's aircraft carried out the strike, or what type of aircraft were used. Libyan officials attacked the U.S. Embassy compound in Tripoli Sunday, as well as the British, French and Italian missions, according to a senior U.S. official in Washington. All four NATO nations are taking part in the airstrikes. Mark Toner, a U.S. State Department spokesman, said he had seen reports of violence against the diplomatic facilities and that if true, ""we condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms."" Italian officials told CNN that the embassy of Qatar, a Gulf Arab state that supports the campaign and is supplying arms to the rebels, was also targeted. The senior U.S. official said Turkey, the protecting power for U.S. interests in Libya, is trying to keep an eye on the American compound -- but ""there isn't much they can do when you have an organized mob, as this appeared to be."" In London, British Foreign Secretary William Hague expelled Libya's ambassador to the United Kingdom after the attacks. Hague said the Tripoli government is breaching its international obligation to protect diplomatic missions by allowing the vandalism. ""The attacks against diplomatic missions will not weaken our resolve to protect the civilian population in Libya,"" Hague said. Ibrahim told CNN the attacks happened because ""the people were upset"" and that Libyan security forces stopped the attacks and prevented the embassies from being destroyed. ""There are embassies that have not been touched,"" he said. Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said later the government deeply regrets the looting and violence at the embassies. Angry crowds simply overwhelmed police, he said. In addition, 12 U.N. international staffers left Tripoli because of the unrest and are in Tunisia, the world body said Sunday. Spokeswoman Eri Kaneko said the United Nations would not identify the staffers or their agencies for safety reasons. U.N. national staffers are still in the country and international staffers remain in Benghazi.

"One hundred years ago Monday, Theodore Roosevelt launched the most successful third party presidential bid in American history, declaring, ""We stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord!"" It was the culmination of the Progressive Party Convention in Chicago on August 6, 1912.  And its influence still echoes through our politics today. Roosevelt, the former president, had tried and failed to wrest the GOP nomination from his successor, William Howard Taft. His supporters believed that the nomination had been stolen by the conservative power brokers and declared their independence. And so the Progressive Party was briefly born. Known as ""The Bull Moose"" party, after Roosevelt's declaration that he felt ""as strong as a bull moose,"" supporters saw it as defending the legacy of Abraham Lincoln against the big business establishment that had taken over the Republican Party after the Civil War. The Democrats -- the populist party whose base was in corrupt, big-city bosses and the states of the former Confederacy -- were also an unappealing alternative. ""The old parties are husks, with no real soul within either, divided on artificial lines, boss-ridden and privilege-controlled,"" Roosevelt declared, ""each a jumble of incongruous elements, and neither daring to speak out wisely and fearlessly what should be said on the vital issues of the day."" Roosevelt's Progressive Party definitely did not shy away from taking fearless stands on the vital issues of the day.  The party's platform backed giving women the right to vote, the abolition of child labor, minimum wages, social security, public health standards, wildlife conservation, workman's compensation, insurance against sickness and unemployment, lobbying reform, campaign finance reform and election reform. With socialist, communist and anarchist forces gaining momentum across the Atlantic, this was a platform dedicated to Roosevelt's wise belief that ""reform is the antidote to revolution."" The assembled crowd was not radical, described by the famed Kansas newspaper editor William Allen White as ""successful, middle class country town citizens, the farmer whose barn was painted, the well-paid railroad engineer and the country editor ... women doctors, women lawyers, women teachers. .. Proletarian and Plutocrat were absent."" In other words, this was a Main Street, middle-class revolt against special interests on the far left and far right. Among the Bull Moosers in the crowd were former Democrats and Republicans, including future Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, columnist Walter Lippman, ""wise-use conservationist"" Gifford Pinchot, Judge Learned Hand and settlement house pioneer Jane Addams, who became the first woman to give a nominating speech at an American political convention. The energy of the occasion left an indelible impression on a generation. The best recent recounting of the convention comes in Edmund Morris' ""Colonel Roosevelt,"" the third volume of his essential work of American biography. In the moment, White described Roosevelt ""charging down the hotel corridors, stalking down an aisle of the Coliseum while the crowds roared, walking like a gladiator to the lions."" In contrast to the upcoming conventions in Tampa, Florida, and Charlotte, North Carolina, the atmosphere was one of real, not canned, drama -- electric and unexpected. ""Can we imagine a convention today erupting in 'Onward Christian Soldiers' just impromptu?"" asks Terrence Brown, the Theodore Roosevelt Association's executive director. ""We've come to a place where putting out fresh ideas is dangerous in politics. Candidates don't want to give an agenda. That's the difference.  TR campaigned with an agenda. He told the convention, 'use me up and cast me aside.'  Take all of these ideas and run with them. ... The goal was moving along the Progressive Party's vision for what the new America in the 20th century should be."" Roosevelt and the Progressive Party were not successful in their effort to win the White House in 1912.  But they won 27% of the popular vote -- an all-time high for third parties in presidential elections -- and Roosevelt won 88 electoral votes to Taft's eight. The Democrats cannily nominated their own progressive candidate, Woodrow Wilson, and he won the election in a landslide against the divided Republicans. But the ideas Roosevelt and the Progressives fought for did succeed in time. Some, such as expanding the right to vote, enacting Social Security and ending child labor, seem obvious to modern eyes. Others, such as the fight for expanded health insurance, remain contentious civic debates.  And concerns about the disproportionate influence of big business and other special interests on American elections and policy seem ripped from modern headlines. The political fault lines of the 1912 elections endure to this day as well. President Barack Obama has explicitly tried to cast himself as the inheritor of Roosevelt's progressive party fight in a Kansas speech earlier this year.  The Republican Party still contains competing establishment and reform factions, most recently seen in the factional split between George W. Bush and John McCain in 2000.  And certainly there remain many independent-minded Americans who feel frustrated and politically homeless when faced with the two parties today. They are reformers in a world of radicals and reactionaries. Politics is history in the present tense, and the study of history can inspire us to aim high in our own lives.  In honor of the 100th anniversary of the 1912 election, the Theodore Roosevelt birthplace in Manhattan has mounted an exhibit focused on his Bull Moose campaign. Enclosed are speeches, campaign cartoons and political posters.  (Full disclosure, I'm on the advisory board of the Theodore Roosevelt Association). Perhaps most striking is the sight of Roosevelt's still-faintly bloodstained shirt, where bullet holes mark the October 1912 assassination attempt, alongside the gun the would-be killer fired.  The bullet's velocity was stopped by an eyeglass case and a thick manuscript, for a speech which Roosevelt characteristically insisted on giving before going to the hospital. ""I have altogether too important things to think of to feel any concern over my own death,"" Roosevelt declared.  ""I am ahead of the game anyway. No man has had a happier life than I have led."" One hundred years later, Roosevelt's vigorous citizenship and heroic sense of politics still inspire.  If we understand the lessons of his life correctly, it can still instruct.

"Editor's note: Audrey Kurth Cronin, a professor at the U.S. National War College and research associate of the Changing Character of War program at Oxford University, is the author of ""How Terrorism Ends: Understanding the Decline and Demise of Terrorist Campaigns"" (Princeton University Press, September 2009). This article represents her views only, not necessarily those of any U.S. government agency. Audrey Kurth Cronin says recent events have raised new concerns about terrorism and al Qaeda. (CNN) -- President Obama entered office hoping to displace the global war on terrorism with a new age of engagement, thereby replacing fear with hope and relinquishing terrorism as the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy. Yet terrorism is once again in the center of the bull's-eye for Washington policymakers. The war in Afghanistan is at a watershed. Having been relatively neglected in favor of the intervention in Iraq, the administration must now decide whether to recommit to a full-fledged counter-insurgency, perhaps with an additional 40,000 U.S. troops on top of the more than 60,000 already slated for the conflict. Alternatively, some argue for a strategy that focuses on the original problem -- of al Qaeda and its extremist associates rather than more ambitious state-building. The former would appear to be more costly and perhaps a slippery slope to a protracted war that might not be winnable; the latter could be ineffective in halting the potential resurgence in an unstable region of an al Qaeda threat to the United States and its allies. Meanwhile, in the past few weeks it seems clear that the United States has foiled a series of terrorist plots that collectively constituted the gravest threat to the American homeland since 9/11. Najibullah Zazi, a 24-year-old Afghan immigrant, has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction in New York, while a Jordanian has been arrested, accused of attempting to destroy a Dallas, Texas, skyscraper. In addition, charges have been made against three men in North Carolina for plotting to attack a Marine Corps base and another man has been charged with conspiring to blow up federal buildings in Illinois. Is al Qaeda resurgent? Is the United States under threat because of the failure to capture or kill Osama bin Laden? Americans need to take a deep breath, because the answer to both questions, while requiring some caveats, is no. Al Qaeda is facing more negative trends than what international forces are facing in Afghanistan, although it is always possible that U.S. missteps could rekindle the extremist terror narrative and organization. Similarly, killing bin Laden will not end al Qaeda, but neither will his fugitive status sustain it. To answer the question of how al Qaeda will end, we can draw upon decades of experience with how other terrorist campaigns have fizzled out. The history of terrorist groups points to various ways they may decline and end: the destruction of leadership, failure to transition between generations, achieving their stated cause, negotiating a settlement, succumbing to military or police repression, losing popular support and transitioning to other malignant activities such as criminality or war. Not all of these pathways are probable for every group, and they are not all relevant to al Qaeda. For example, it is clear that al Qaeda will not end if Osama bin Laden is killed. Groups that have ended this way such as Japan's Aum Shinrikyo or Peru's Shining Path have been hierarchical, reflecting to some degree a cult of personality and lacking a viable successor, none of which describes al Qaeda. It also will not die out between generations, as did many of the left-wing groups of the 1970s. Al Qaeda has transitioned beyond its original structure and is a multigenerational threat. Likewise, achieving the cause or reaching a negotiated settlement does not apply to al Qaeda. Groups that have achieved their ends have had limited goals. Al Qaeda seeks maximalist goals: Using violence to mobilize the global Muslim community, throw off the influence of the West, eliminate support for Arab regimes and establish a new world order (sometimes called a Caliphate) is hardly realistic. The remaining pathways deserve greater scrutiny. Although the campaign against al Qaeda has yielded gratifying results, the limits of driving the core into hiding and reducing its capacity to operate have been demonstrated. Democracies find it hard to sustain policy of repression at home or abroad, as it can undermine civil liberties and strain domestic support. American use of military force signified Western resolve, killed al Qaeda leaders and prevented attacks, all of which were vital; but force alone cannot drive this group to its end. A loss of popular support has ended many terrorist groups, and it is a plausible scenario for al Qaeda. Support can be compromised through miscalculation, especially in targeting, and popular backlash. The Real Irish Republican Army and India's Sikh separatists come to mind. Or a campaign can fail to convey a positive image or progress toward its goals, which amply applies to al Qaeda. While the group continues to be dangerous, the faltering popularity of this campaign with most Muslims provides clear evidence of this dynamic underway. For instance, a Pew Global Attitudes Project poll released in September showed a remarkable drop in support for suicide bombing and Osama bin Laden in key Muslim-majority countries such as Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey and Jordan. In Pakistan, whereas some 41 percent approved of suicide terror attacks five years ago, that number has fallen to a mere 5 percent today. Finally, groups can transition from terrorism to other kinds of violence, escalating to insurgency or even conventional war, for example -- especially if there is state sponsorship. Some argue that this may already have happened in the case of al Qaeda and link the current debate over Afghan strategy to this concern. In this regard, it is counterproductive to consider al Qaeda as a global insurgency. This concept bestows legitimacy, emphasizes territorial control, encourages our enemies to join forces and puts the United States into an us-versus-them strategic framework that precludes clear-eyed analyses of the strategies of leverage that are being used against the United States and its allies. In short, if we are thinking about classic pathways to the end, the secret to undermining this campaign is not ""winning hearts and minds"" but enhancing al Qaeda's tendency to lose them. More terrorist attacks will be attempted and a few will no doubt succeed in parts of the world, conceivably even in the United States. But it makes a significant difference whether such attacks are undertaken by a few recruits without proper training or support or by those who have managed to visit an al Qaeda training camp in a safe haven with full support. Thus far, the trends are heading in a favorable direction. Even in its diminished state, al Qaeda and its franchises remain armed and dangerous. This group can still hurt us. But appreciating how terrorist campaigns actually end offers the greatest promise for removing ourselves from the strategic myopia that currently grips much of Western counter-terrorism efforts and for clarifying our political objectives. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Audrey Kurth Cronin.","Audrey Cronin: Terror arrests and Afghan debate make it seem al Qaeda is gaining .

"Mitt Romney picked up a highly prized endorsement Wednesday from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush after a convincing victory the night before in the Illinois primary but then saw a top adviser's televised comment provide new ammunition to his trailing rivals in the Republican presidential race. Eric Fehrnstrom, Romney's senior campaign adviser, was asked in a CNN interview Wednesday morning whether the former Massachusetts governor had been forced to adopt conservative positions in the rugged race that could hurt his standing with moderates in November's general election. ""I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes,"" Fehrnstrom responded. ""It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again."" Rival candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, who are vying for conservative support against the more moderate Romney, seized on the comment as indicative of their longstanding criticism that Romney shifts his positions on issues such as health care reform and abortion to suit his political needs. Gingrich brought out an Etch A Sketch at a campaign appearance in Louisiana, where the next primary takes place Saturday. ""You have to stand for something that lasts longer than this,"" Gingrich said at the Lake Charles event, holding the drawing toy invented in 1959. ""You could not have found a more perfect illustration of why people distrust Romney than to have his (adviser) say that the Etch A Sketch allows you to erase everything in the general election,"" Gingrich added. ""You have to read the guy's quote to realize -- if he had set out to highlight for everybody why we distrust Romney, I think he couldn't have done a better job."" Santorum's campaign posted a photo on Twitter of the candidate using an Etch A Sketch, saying it showed him ""studying up on (Romney's) policy positions."" Romney ""will say what he needs to say to win the election before him, and if he has to say something different because it's a different election and a different group of voters, he will say that, too,"" Santorum said while campaigning in Harvey, Louisiana. ""Well, that should be comforting to all of you who are voting in this primary."" Fehrnstrom later said he was referring to the campaign as a whole, and Romney spoke to reporters after an afternoon event to try to exercise some damage control. ""Organizationally, a general election campaign takes on a different profile,"" Romney said. ""The issues I am running on will be exactly the same. I am running as a conservative Republican. I was a conservative Republican governor. I will be running as a conservative Republican nominee, at that point hopefully, for president. The policies and positions are the same."" However, the Etch A Sketch remark -- coming on what should have been a triumphant day that happened to be Romney's 43rd wedding anniversary -- threatened to sap attention from his growing momentum toward winning the nomination to face President Barack Obama in November. Romney scored a solid victory in Tuesday's Illinois primary, followed by the endorsement Wednesday from Bush, a respected Republican leader once considered a possible presidential contender this year. ""Now is the time for Republicans to unite behind Gov. Romney and take our message of fiscal conservatism and job creation to all voters this fall,"" Bush, the brother of one Republican former president and son of another, said in a statement. A spokesman for Gingrich said the Bush endorsement merely demonstrated the Republican establishment's push for Romney instead of a less conventional candidate like the former House speaker. ""It's a completion of the establishment trifecta,"" Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond said in reference to endorsements for Romney by former President George H.W. Bush, former Sen. Bob Dole and now Jeb Bush. Analysts sounded like the Republican campaign was essentially over. Romney's Illinois victory showed ""the writing's on the wall"" for the rest of the field, said CNN analyst Erick Erickson, a longtime Romney critic. ""This comes down to Mitt Romney,"" Erickson said. ""Not only is he the front-runner but the nominee. This is a clear win for Mitt Romney tonight in a state with blue-collar voters, with industrial voters and suburban voters."" The Illinois result followed established patterns in the Republican race, with Romney doing well in urban and suburban areas while Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator who is his main conservative rival, ran strong in rural areas. In Chicago, Romney had 55% of the total with 99% of precincts reporting, while Santorum notched 25%, according to the city's election website. In Lake County, one of the surrounding counties near Chicago, Romney had 56% with all precincts reporting, according to the clerk's office website, and Santorum had 28%. Texas Rep. Ron Paul and Gingrich trailed well back, according to unofficial results from local clerks and election boards. The results gave Romney at least 41 of the 54 delegates up for grabs in the state, increasing his total to 562, according to CNN's estimate. Santorum is second with 249, Gingrich third with 137 and Paul last with 69. A total of 1,144 delegates is needed to clinch the GOP nomination. Romney's campaign trumpeted the Illinois showing as a broad-based triumph, seeking to overcome questions about the candidate's ability to win over the conservative GOP base. ""Romney won with tea party voters. He won with Catholics,"" campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said. ""There are a lot of groups within the Republican Party, and Gov. Romney has won their votes."" In remarks to cheering supporters, Romney resumed his front-runner attacks on Obama's economic, health care and spending policies. ""The simple truth is, this president does not understand the genius of this economy,"" Romney said, adding that ""the American economy is fueled by freedom."" Santorum skipped Illinois on primary night and awaited the results in Gettysburg in his home state of Pennsylvania. In his concession speech, below a banner that proclaimed ""Freedom,"" he said he was staying in the race to battle a government that he complained was ""trying to order us around."" ""This is an election about fundamental and foundational things,"" Santorum said, attacking Romney's claim of greater business and government management experience. ""This is an election about not who's the best person to manage Washington or manage the economy. We don't need a manager, we need someone who's going to pull government up by the roots and do something to liberate the private sector in America."" Santorum said he expected to do better in upcoming primaries and caucuses, adding: ""We are feeling very, very good about winning Louisiana on Saturday."" Santorum has made a strong showing in traditionally conservative Southern states, winning Alabama and Mississippi a week ago, while Romney finished third. Another Santorum victory in Louisiana would continue the pattern of the race, while a Romney win would signal growing support from the conservative base that he needs to finish off his rivals. Romney's Illinois victory followed an overwhelming triumph Sunday in Puerto Rico, where Romney got 83% of the vote and picked up all 20 delegates at stake. Gingrich, who appears increasingly unlikely to mount another comeback after two previous campaign surges, issued a statement Tuesday night blasting Romney for relying on his vast financial resources rather than offering ""solutions that hold the president accountable for his failures."" ""To defeat Barack Obama, Republicans can't nominate a candidate who relies on outspending his opponents 7-1,"" Gingrich said. Saul, the Romney spokeswoman, responded:  ""That's like a basketball team complaining they lost to another team because their players were too tall. ""Fundraising is part of a campaign. So is organization,"" Saul said. Gingrich plans to head to Louisiana, as does Paul, the libertarian champion with a small but devoted following.","Mitt Romney responds to Etch A Sketch comment by affirming his conservatism .

"Two teenage girls were killed early Tuesday when a train derailed on the bridge they were sitting on, spilling coal and burying the young women, police in Maryland said. Rose Mayr and Elizabeth Nass, both 19, were apparently sitting on a bridge ledge in Ellicott City, Maryland, just after midnight with their backs to the train when it derailed, according to a written statement from Howard County police. The two girls posted photos to Twitter shortly before the crash. One showed feet dangling over a road, with the caption ""Levitating."" Another appeared to look down Main Street. Nass tweeted, ""Drinking on top of the Ellicott City sign with @ r0se_petals."" The name Ellicott City is painted on the railroad bridge. Mayr and Nass were high school classmates of David Butko's. He said he grew concerned when he heard about the accident and saw the pictures on Twitter that indicated Mayr and Nass were on the bridge. iReport: Fatal Train Derailment in Ellicott City MD . ""We went to the site ... hung around, but the police wouldn't let us in,"" he said. Nass was supposed to go back to college at James Madison in Virginia on Tuesday, he said. Classes begin in six days, according the university's website. A spokesman said Nass was an honors student in the interdisciplinary liberal studies program. Mayr was a nursing student at the University of Delaware who was about to start her junior year. ""They were both terrific kids,"" Mount Hebron High School Principal Scott Ruehl said. ""Both girls were really involved in the dance program. They were pleasant; they always said hi in the hallway."" Butko said Mayr was a very funny girl. ""She always had a smile and a joke,"" he said. ""She was goofy at times but could be there for you when you needed it."" Jim Southworth of the National Transportation Safety Board said the investigation into what caused the accident was just beginning. He said the train -- with two locomotives and 80 cars  -- was going 25 mph when it jumped the tracks. The first 21 cars behind the locomotives derailed, he said. None of the three crew members was injured, he said. Marmie Edwards, spokeswoman for Operation Lifesaver, a nonprofit organization that promotes railroad safety measures, said the number of fatalities in 2012 involving people on tracks was up significantly. ""It's probably just as well to stay away, not just to be off the tracks, but stay away from the train so you know you're going to be safe,"" she added. ""Because it's hard to say, 'OK, here it's safe; there it's not.' So just stay away.""

"A judge's decision 27 years ago to throw the book at Jonathan Pollard still reverberates today. Tuesday's news headlines focused on an effort to save imperiled Middle East peace talks, with a possible deal including Pollard's release from the life prison sentence that the U.S. naval intelligence analyst received in 1987 for providing stacks of classified documents to Israel. Then as now, the case involves a convergence of diplomatic, political and religious issues that strain U.S.-Israel relations and evoke emotional, bordering on zealous, reactions in both countries. To the U.S. intelligence and justice communities, Pollard is a turncoat who betrayed his oath and country, not an American Jew who acted out of allegiance to Israel. U.S. intelligence community: no early release . ""Mr. Pollard's apologists portray him as a sort of dual patriot: loyal to the United States, but also motivated to help Israel,"" former FBI lawyer and national counterintelligence official M.E. Bowman wrote in the New York Times in January. ""In fact, he was primarily a venal and selfish person who sought to get rich."" To many Israelis and American Jews, Pollard wanted to help a U.S. ally by providing Israel intelligence information he believed the country should have. Israel has repeatedly sought Pollard's release over past decades. ""It is time for the American Jewish community to put the Pollard case to rest—not by letting him rot in prison, but by standing up against a real injustice,"" said an editorial in Tablet Magazine,  an online journal dedicated to Jewish affairs, in response to Bowman's op-ed. Will U.S. free spy Jonathan Pollard? On March 4, 1987, U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. rejected a plea agreement reached by federal prosecutors and Pollard that offered the possibility of something less than the maximum life sentence in return for an admission of guilt. Journalists covering the case believed Pollard would get 25 years and perhaps less, with the chance for early parole, recalled CNN's Wolf Blitzer, whose book ""Territory of Lies"" chronicled the case. If he had been given the lesser sentence, Pollard would be free today. Maximum sentence . Instead, Robinson imposed the maximum life term, meaning no chance for parole for at least 25 years. According to Blitzer's book, Robinson cited the damage to U.S. national security caused by Pollard's leaks, as then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger asserted in a classified memo to the court. In the memo, parts of which were later declassified and published in Blitzer's book, Weinberger said he sought to ""dispel any presumption that disclosures to an ally are insignificant; to the contrary, substantial and irrevocable damage has been done to this nation."" The memo noted that many documents that Pollard gave Israel were originals that included details on sourcing and the identifications of U.S. agents abroad, potentially putting them at risk. ""Unauthorized disclosures to friendly powers may cause as great a harm to the national security as to hostile powers because, once the information is removed from secure control systems, there is no enforceable requirement nor any incentive to provide effective controls  for its safekeeping,"" Weinberger's memo said, according to Blitzer's book. ""Moreover, it is more probable than not that the information will be used for unintended purposes,"" the memo continued. ""Finally, such disclosures will tend to expose a larger picture of U.S. capabilities and knowledge, or lack thereof, than would be in the U.S. interest to reveal to another power, even to a friendly one."" The Tablet Magazine editorial, however, argued that the Pollard detractors overstated the risk created by the materials he provided to Israel, saying ""the suggestion that passing satellite photos or communications intelligence to a friendly country is a crime on a par with causing the death of a U.S. agent in the field defies common sense."" Possible agreement . An Israeli official told CNN on Tuesday that Pollard could be released before the upcoming Jewish holiday of Passover as part of an agreement to extend the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations into 2015. Under the proposal, the Palestinians would refrain from taking their case for statehood to international bodies such as the United Nations while the talks continue, the Israeli official said. Meanwhile, Israel would release more Palestinian prisoners and limit its construction of new settlements in disputed territory, according to sources familiar with the talks. A Palestinian spokesman dismissed reports of any deal, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also said that no agreement existed ""at this point in time regarding anyone, or any specific steps,"" adding ""there are a lot of different possibilities in play."" At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said U.S. President Barack Obama has made no decision on releasing Pollard. However, Carney made clear that the paramount goal remained a Middle East peace agreement. ""The need for and benefits of a peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, a peace that provides the Palestinians with their own state and provides security to a democratic Jewish state of Israel transcends (the Pollard) issue and any others that are part of the discussions that we have,"" Carney said. Israeli hardliner: Don't free murderers to get Pollard out . In Israel, hardliners who support the release of Pollard say it should happen as part of the U.S. judicial process, rather than in a deal involving the release of Palestinian prisoners. Uri Ariel of the Jewish Home Party said he opposed freeing ""murderers"" in exchange for Pollard's release. Meanwhile, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that Pollard effectively withdrew his parole application on Tuesday by waiving a hearing. There was no immediate explanation for the move by Pollard, who is eligible for parole in November 2015. Charles Leeper, a former U.S. attorney who prosecuted Pollard, told CNN's Evan Perez that any decision to let Pollard out should include a specific condition. ""If the professional diplomats and intelligence officials do decide to release Pollard to Israel,"" he said, ""in my opinion, it should only be on the condition that Israel agrees to keep him and will not try to send him back.""

"(CNN)In the azure waters off the rocky coast of Antikythera, a remote island in the Mediterranean with a population of less than 50, an international team of archaeologists has recovered new treasures from one of the most mysterious shipwrecks of all time. The group of maritime archaeology experts have been at the site since mid-September and armed with the most advanced marine technology available, they have conducted the first-ever scientific excavation of the Antikythera wreck. Despite facing fierce winds and choppy seas during the 30-day mission, the reclaimed items include tableware, anchors and other maritime components, as well as a giant spear, which they believe once belonged to a life-sized bronze warrior statue. The recovered artifacts have been described as ""very promising"" by project co-director Theotokis Theodoulou in a press release from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI). The U.S.-based WHOI worked with Theodoulou and the Hellenic Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities in Greece to lead the expedition. He added: ""We have a lot of work to do at this site to uncover its secrets."" World's first computer found at wreck . In 1900, sponge divers from the Greek island of Symi anchored along the eastern coastline of the island while waiting for a ferocious storm to pass. What they would stumble upon would stun the world. Underneath the crystalline waters, lay the incredible wreck undiscovered for thousands of years. And as the site was explored over the next year, they would uncover life-size bronze statues and remarkable artifacts. But it was the 1902 recovery of a clump of calcified stone with mysterious inscriptions that would push the wreck into archaeological lore. The heavily corroded bronze fragments would turn out to be what has been described as the world's earliest known ""computer,"" designed in the first century BC -- the Antikythera Mechanism. Built to track the astronomical calendar and lunar movements, later radiographic image analysis of the mechanism revealed 30 intricate gear wheels. Famed underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau visited the site in 1976 to film a documentary and returned from below the surface with treasures galore. Since then, the site had remained dormant under the aegis of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture for almost 40 years. ""The Antikythera shipwreck is maybe the most important, most famous shipwreck from antiquity,"" Brendan Foley, an archaeologist from WHOI and co-director of the expedition told CNN before the dive began in September. ""We are hardcore scientists and archaeologists. We hate to speak of treasure but in this case, it's actually a treasure ship and there are just no two ways about it."" Shrouded in mystery . Analysis of the reclaimed artifacts has dated the vessel to the first century BC, while a horde of gold coins retrieved from the water suggests the boat's origins lie east, from Asia Minor. But no one knows for certain how big it is, what it was doing there or why it went down. Yet. Foley said: ""This not just an everyday trader. This is probably one of the largest, most expensive ships that was sailing in the first century BC. The 1901 sponge divers reported that the artifacts were spread among an area about 52 meters along the seafloor. And that corresponds nicely with what we've observed in our dives on the site."" Supported by the Hellenic Navy, Foley and his 32-man team have been provided with research vessels capable of raising artifacts weighing up to five tons straight off the seabed. ""You never want to speak about absolutes or guarantees but I've never felt more confident in a shipwreck that there is going to be something interesting on it,"" Foley said. ""In the 1901 and '76 operations, they were getting gemstones, gold stones and human remains. And human remains almost never come up from ancient shipwrecks. So with modern ancient DNA analysis, there are all kinds of questions that can now be posed if we recover some."" With the location at around 55 meters deep, it's not particularly hard to get to. Foley explained: ""This shipwreck is close to the shore. It's only about 70 meters off the cliff face so it makes it very difficult to bring in a big ship to support any kind of robotic systems so we came up with a plan and have been putting it into practice over the last three years -- incrementally training on new technology so that we could get and do very vigorous science. ""At the most basic level, if we can come away from this important shipwreck site with a very, very good map and a much better understanding of the layout of the wreck, from that data we can begin to pose new questions to drive forward the research,"" explained Foley, who has worked with the Ministry of Culture in Greece for the last decade. The international expedition started by mapping out the site using ""Sirius,"" an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from the Australian Centre for Field Robotics. The AUV conducted a high-resolution survey of the wreck site to create precise 3D documentation of the expansive debris field. Meanwhile, technical divers equipped with metal detectors scanned the seafloor to determine the extent of the wreckage under the sediment before test trench excavations were able to begin. Underwater ""Iron Man"" The team also arrived in Greece with a next-generation diving suit that could revolutionize the future of ocean exploration. Looking like something straight out of ""Iron Man,"" the Exosuit is an atmospheric diving system, created by Vancover-based Nuytco Research, originally designed for offshore exploration of oil fields. Repurposed for the expedition, Foley explained it offers the team extensive bottom time at the site. ""The system itself for the Exosuit has life support for something like 40 hours if all went to hell. I mean, really, it's when you get tired and sore, and want to have a sandwich and use the toilet, that you come up,"" he said. And the best part is the simplicity of the technology, revealed its creator Phil Nuytten. ""You can literally operate the Exosuit after a few hours of training. The majority of the training is spent in emergency drills. But the actual functioning of it is as simple as learning to drive a golf cart,"" said Nuytten, a pioneer in deep-sea exploratory technology. ""The suit is controlled by footpads that can tilt forward, backwards or from side to side."" Aside from Exosuit's ease, Nuytten also highlighted how the suit negates some of the side effects of conventional saturation diving, like decompression sickness and prolonged, unnecessary dive times. ""In the Exosuit, you jump into it and the compression time is zero. You're down to 1,000ft within 10 minutes and you can spend six to eight hours there and then come back in 10 minutes instead of 10 days."" But for the dive team, it's the opportunity for exploration that is the biggest pull of Exosuit. ""We figure by the end of the first two days with Exosuit, we'll have more time on the Antikythera shipwreck than any other dive put together that's gone before it,"" said Foley. A doomed dowry? It's been a mammoth undertaking and with a bill at over €2 million (over $2.5 million), the team was hoping the Mediterranean would yield some of its secrets. Prior to this scientific dive, the archaeologists had little to go on and were left to come up with theories based on the little historical evidence at hand. When human remains -- including a skull that was 80% intact -- were recovered in '76, a treasure trove of jewelry, perfume bottles and other female-related trinkets were found close by. ""One of our pet theories is that maybe this ship was carrying a really wealthy woman from Asia Minor, and she was going to be married and this cargo was her dowry. It's impossible to prove but it's a nice romantic notion,"" said Foley. With such a long passage of time between when the ship sank and the present day, and so many unanswered questions, the scientists and archaeologists expect to be working on the project for at least the next five years. And it's a journey Foley is excited to have embarked on. ""I like to think of shipwrecks as books, books in a library. The seafloor is a vast library and with every single shipwreck, there is a book telling us about the past and the artifact that we raise is like a page in that book. ""So if we want to try to recreate the ancient past and figure out who we are, who we came from, why we live in this modern world, then the only way to do that is to look at the physical remains of past cultures.""","Divers have recovered new items from 2000-year-old wreck site .

"The government-run health insurance exchanges have been open for business for 20 days. But a host of issues have plagued the highly anticipated launch, making it difficult for both consumers and insurance providers. ""There's no sugarcoating it,"" President Barack Obama said from the Rose Garden on Monday. ""The problem has been that the website that's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody."" What's not working . Error messages: HealthCare.gov is plagued with technical problems. The Obama administration hasn't completely released the cause or extent of the problems, likely because they haven't quite figured them out. But people in all but 14 states and the District of Columbia are having trouble applying for the exchanges because the website isn't allowing them to complete the process. ""I put in my user name and password, it didn't recognize it,"" CNN's Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen reported Monday, saying that the website gave her error messages or said ""page not found"" or that the system was down. Obamacare open enrollment: Here's everything you need to know . The problems appear to have been worse for those who signed up in the first days the exchanges opened. Spinning icon: For others, the website is extremely slow. The spinning icon that indicates that the website is working, albeit slowly, is a huge frustration in the age of (relatively) fast connection speeds. Faulty information: It's not only consumers wanting to sign up for health insurance who are having trouble, but the insurance companies that provide coverage are experiencing difficulties with the exchanges, too. Insurance companies say the technical problems are causing the companies to receive both incomplete customer information and duplicate applications. Internet overload: The White House indicated that the problems are exacerbated because of the large number of people who have visited HealthCare.gov. Obama said 20 million have visited the site since the exchanges opened on October 1. While the President said he would not excuse the problem, he said half a million people have managed to apply. But it is unclear how many of them have made it all the way through the sign up process. While that's a large number, it's only a fraction of the 48 million uninsured and 20 million who have visited HealthCare.gov. Still, as some have been able to sign up, it's not all bad: . Have you had trouble signing up? Tell us your experience . What's working . State-run exchanges: Fourteen states and the District of Columbia are running their own exchanges. Those websites are working much better. Many of the states refused to implement their own exchanges in large part because of ideological opposition to the health care law, forcing the federal government to fill the void. 1-800-318-2596: That's the number to call if you want to sign up for health insurance by phone; by speaking to an actual person. It works. Obama said wait times are ""less than a minute."" Cohen confirmed that receiving help via phone was a cinch. ""They're terrific. They're very helpful and they answer almost instantly,"" she said of the call operators. 5 things that have happened since Obamacare launched . Navigators: Recent polls suggest that the majority of people don't know much about the Affordable Care Act. A nonprofit set up to help people sign up for Obamcare, Enroll America, said they are seeing changes. Justin Nisly, spokesman for Enroll America, said they have nearly doubled the number, from 4,000 to 7,000, working to educate the uninsured about the exchanges and health insurance. Information: Before the exchanges opened, the cost and services provided were largely unknown. But both HealthCare.gov and the state-run exchange websites are providing detailed information about what people will get and how much it will cost. Time: While the exchanges opened on October 1, coverage doesn't begin until January 1, and the deadline for having coverage in place is March 1, so there's still time to sign up. Officials are recommending people who need to sign up do so by February 15 to ensure the coverage will take effect in time.","A host of issues have plagued the launch of Obamacare's insurance exchanges .

"Iceland is pinning its hopes on the Arctic as Europe continues to suffer from high unemployment and faltering growth. Iceland's president Olafur Ragnar Grimsson told CNN's Richard Quest: ""The Arctic region is gradually becoming one of the most important playing grounds in the 21st century world economy."" His comments come four years after the country let its debt-ridden banks fail, and as the country's growth looks set to far outpace the eurozone. Grimsson said the decision not to save the banks was ""the most difficult I ever had to make,"" but maintained it was the right one. ""Allowing the banks to fail is one of the fundamental reasons Iceland is now in a strong recovery with respect to other European countries,"" he said. Now, according to Grimsson, ""Iceland is better placed to benefit by maintaining our present position, rather than to let the EU speak on our behalf."" Iceland fishing for deal on EU quotas . The 69-year-old president pointed to Norway and Greenland -- two other Arctic economies and non-European Union members -- as role models. He said he would not hesitate to veto a parliamentary decision to seek EU membership, a promise he told CNN he had based five successful presidential runs on. However, Grimsson said he was not sure whether Iceland's strategy with its banks could have been replicated by other countries with similar problems, such as Ireland. ""Being part of the eurozone, they couldn't devalue their currency. But they could have adopted our policy with respect to the banks,"" he said. The Icelandic krona fell sharply as a result of the financial collapse, helping the country recover by increasing demand for  exports. ""There are still scars,"" Grimsson said, ""but on the whole, the will of the Icelandic people has enabled us to recover and move confidently towards the future.""","Iceland is pinning its hopes on the Arctic region as the eurozone remains in financial crisis .

"We can't settle iPhone vs. Android or ""Star Wars"" vs. ""Star Trek"" for you. But another long-running geek debate was put to rest Tuesday night. Those short, animated loops that have captivated the Web for decades? They're pronounced like a brand of peanut butter. Steve Wilhite created the Graphics Interchange Format, or GIF, while working for Compuserve in 1987. On Tuesday, he received a Webby Award for it and delivered his five-word acceptance speech (that's all the Webbys allow) by flashing a GIF on the big screens at the Cipriani Wall Street in New York. And, in a flash, it all became clear: . ""It's pronounced JIF, not GIF."" Of course, in the grand tradition of heated debate, a flat statement of fact by the creator wasn't enough to sway some partisans. On Twitter, ""GIF"" became a trending topic as some folks pushed back. ""Graphics Interchange Format. Graphics. Not Jraphics. #GIF #hardg,"" wrote Web designer Dan Cederholm. ""So instead of GIF, we've got to say JIF? YEAH RIGHT,"" chimed in October Jones, creator of the ""Texts From Dog"" Tumblr and book. ""And I suppose those animals with long necks are called 'JIRAFFES.'"" And, of course, the peanut butter brand was getting lots of free publicity along the way. The always amusing HAL 9000 account (yes, somebody tweets as the robot from ""2001"") posted an ""animated JIF"" -- which is to say, a swirling, animated jar of the tasty, high-protein spread. So, it's perhaps no surprise that the company got into the act itself. Wednesday afternoon, the company took to Twitter with a post reading, ""It's pronounced Jif® ."" The tweet linked to, what else, a multi-colored GIF flashing the same phrase. Animated GIFs were a staple of the early Internet. Remember The Dancing Baby? That's a GIF. They fell out of favor as more advanced graphics technology emerged. But in the past couple of years, the Web has remembered how much fun it is to watch ridiculous things happen over and over again. Appropriately, Wilhite received his Lifetime Achievement Award from David Karp, the founder of Tumblr, one prominent place where GIFs found a new fanbase. In less publicized interviews, Wilhite had argued for the soft-G pronunciation for years. So, will a widely covered ""speech"" in front of some of the Web's most influential folks finally be the turning point? Maybe not. Last month, no less an authority than the White House posted an image on its new Tumblr feed advocating for the hard-G. And the Oxford English Dictionary says both pronunciations are acceptable. So, here's wishing Mr. Wilhite ""Jood Luck.""","GIF creator: It's pronounced ""JIF""

"(CNN)Jules Bianchi remains unconscious in a French hospital following his horrific crash at October's Japanese Grand Prix, but the Formula One driver has begun a program of rehabilitation therapy, according to a statement released by his family on Tuesday. Bianchi, who suffered a head injury while driving for the now defunct Marussia team, skidded off the track in wet conditions and collided with a recovery vehicle. The Frenchman sustained a ""diffuse axonal injury"" which causes widespread tearing of nerve fibers across the whole of the brain, according to UK brain charity, Headway. He returned to France last month and  was treated at the intensive care unit of Le Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (CHU) before moving on to the rehabilitation center. ""As we reach the conclusion of a difficult year for our family, we wanted to take this opportunity to provide a further update regarding Jules' medical situation, per our pledge to communicate continued information, when appropriate, to his many fans,"" said the driver's parents, Philippe and Christine in a statement. ""It was a significant and very comforting step for us to be able to bring Jules home to France last month, to continue his rehabilitation surrounded by his family and friends. This is very important for Jules and also for us. ""Jules' neurological status remains unchanged; he is unconscious but able to breathe unaided. Whilst there is no significant information to report, we take a great deal of comfort from the fact that Jules continues to fight, as we knew he would, and this has enabled the medical professionals caring for him to commence the planned, but very painstaking, program of rehabilitation therapy."" Bianchi's parents say they will continue to provide updates of their son's progress and thanked the public for their ongoing support. The statement added: ""As we reflect on the events of the past few months, we would like to acknowledge once again the overwhelming warmth and affection shown towards our son. These continue to be challenging times for our family, but the knowledge that he has touched the lives of so many people all around the world has helped us through."" Earlier this month, the FIA published a report which stated that Bianchi ""did not slow sufficiently to avoid losing control"" during his crash at the Suzuka circuit. Bianchi's Marussia team folded in November after administrators failed to find fresh investment. In the days after the crash, Marussia moved to address accusations that Bianchi had not reduced his speed and that the team had actively encouraged him not to do so. ""The Marussia F1 Team is shocked and angered by these allegations,"" said the statement issued in October. ""At a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital, and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for Jules and his family, it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumors and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of Jules' accident. ""Regarding point 1, Jules did slow down under the double waved yellow flags. That is an irrefutable fact, as proven by the telemetry data, which the team has provided to the FIA. ""Regarding point 2, an audio copy of the full radio transmission between Jules and the team, and a written transcript, were provided to the FIA. ""It is quite clear from the transmission and the transcript that at no point during the period leading up to Jules' accident did the team urge Jules to drive faster or make any comments suggesting that he should do so."" The update on the French driver's condition comes a day after the first anniversary of Michael Schumacher's skiing accident. The seven-time world champion is continuing his recovery from the severe head injuries sustained in a crash at the French ski resort of Meribel on 29th December last year. Schumacher spent nine months in hospital in France following emergency brain surgery but was moved to the family home near Lake Geneva in Switzerland in September to continue his rehabilitation. While the German's family declined to give an update on his condition, Formula One drivers and fans expressed their continuing support for the stricken driver on social media.","Jules Bianchi remains unconscious in French hospital .
